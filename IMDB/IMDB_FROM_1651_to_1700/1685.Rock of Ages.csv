0,SnoopyStyle,"80s karaoke, bland story",5,26 August 2013,It's 1987 Los Angeles and we're introduced to the rock club where stars are born. Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is fresh off the bus from small town USA. Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) is the nice guy working at the club. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) is the rock God of the club.This is basically a 2 hour non-stop karaoke session of 80s rock song. The story is filled with bland clinches. It lacks any surprises or tension. Everybody put a lot of effort into this. They tell us all the time as they ham it up every second.,Rock of Ages
1,Prismark10,The rock opera,7,3 September 2013,"This Rock Musical is an adaptation of the popular stage show set in the late 1980s. This gives it an excuse to show 80s fashion and feature 80s rock hits all mixed up with a cheesy Boy meets Girl love story.The love story is predictable, in fact even the side stories are predictable but the cast give it gusto from Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta Jones to Alec Baldwin.Cruise plays an Axl Rose/Bret Michaels type rock star in a glorified cameo. His singing one suspects had Auto-tuning involved.However it is the songs that sells this film, ranging from 'We built this City' to 'Don't stop Believing.'The film is a cheesefest but it is an enjoyable one. It might not rival Grease but a lot of thought has been put into bringing this to the screen.",Rock of Ages
2,mark.waltz,"This would work as the best musical of 1933...oh wait it was, as ""42nd Street"".",2,27 March 2013,"Except that ""42nd Street"" has changed to Sunset Boulevard's Bourbon Club, a fictional rock venue similar to the Viper Room and the Whiskey a go-go. This could also be referred to as ""the rip off movie"" with its theft of ideas from films dating from ""42nd Street"" to rock and roll films of the 1960's (like ""Don't Knock the Rock"") where elderly squares bellowed lines like ""rock and roll has got to go!"" while smashing a 45 rpm record, up to John Waters' camp classic ""Cry Baby"". Even ""Caddyshack"" (the snobs vs. the slobs) is referenced in this adaption of the Broadway hit that just leaves a huge uncomfortable taste in my mouth.Having lived in Los Angeles during mid 1980's when this takes place, I can confirm the existence of people walking around either with sweaters neatly placed over their shoulders or those scary mullet hair styles that today get sneers. However, there is a total feeling of falseness in the story of the Oklahoma transplant (Julianne Hough) who meets sweet bar back Diego Boneta on her first night in Los Angeles, aids him in his ambition to become a rock star, and the misunderstanding that arises when a creepy aging rock star (Tom Cruise who mumbles most of his lines like a spaced-out Hamlet) seemingly makes a play for her. Mayoral candidate Bryan Cranston longs to close up all the Sunset Strip clubs he claims are destroying the morality of the city, and his Stepford Wife like spouse Catherine Zeta Jones strives to keep her secret past from him (as he does with his spanking fetish) while breaking into light rock songs like ""We're Not Gonna Take It Anymore!"" (in a Beverly Hills Church no less!).Then, there's the middle aged Alec Baldwin as the Bourbon Club owner who breaks into ""Can't Fight This Feeling"" (by Air Supply) when he discovers his true love in one of the film's oddest sequences that tries to hard to be ""cute"" but is simply a temptation to hold your nose. Mary J. Blidge has the most meaningless part of the film, but she is the only one who really comes out of the film unscathed, performing a duet of ""Harden My Heart"" with Hough and being a throwback to all those big-hearted cynical dames that were a staple of films of the 1930's and 40's. The real detriment of this film is the presence of Cruise whose character comes straight out of a bad Saturday morning cartoon. His performance of ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" with Malin Åkerman (as a Rolling Stone Magazine reporter) is nothing more than a gratuitous porn sequence where fortunately the actors keep their clothes on. Russell Brand as Baldwin's ""sidekick"" and Paul Giamatti as a sleazy agent are other oddball characters that add to the ""eew!"" feeling of the film. The selection of music is actually pretty good with lyrics the audience can actually understand. The only thing this accomplished for me, though, was missing certain hot spots of L.A. during the 80's like Tower Records on Sunset Strip (one of the best record stores of all times during its heyday) and the Hollywood sign which you were able to walk up to before it was later gated off. True fans of the music are better of listening to the original albums rather than the trite story which unfolds here. Talk about ""Crock of Rages"".Update, December 9, 2014: I finally broke down to go see the musical on Broadway, and while I certainly rank it higher than this, I now understand the changes they made, particularly the change from a German businessman and his effeminate son being behind the take-over of the strip changed to a wealthy couple of nitwits. The nostalgia factor was there for me still, and even reviews I've read of both the show and the movie reflect my feelings of this as a cartoonish look back at a great era in West Hollywood history. Still, I couldn't help but fight the feeling that this era is one that was doomed to disappear even though the famous rock clubs still exist. So the next time I happen to drive down Sunset Boulevard and see that overly designed strip mall on the corner of Sunset and Laurel Canyon, I'll think of this movie and sneer.",Rock of Ages
3,nogodnomasters,DON'T STOP BELIEVING,8,24 July 2018,"This is perhaps the best rock and roll fable since ""Streets of Fire."" The music incorporates 80's rock songs into a fictitious 1980's Los Angeles setting. The mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is leading a crusade against rock, especially Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) a heavy metal rocker god in the midst of a waning career needing a kick start. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta star as the two wanna-be rock stars. Oh if they could just get their break....The music is both the plus and minus side to the film. It comes across as a movie which upholds the standards of rock, but succumbs to the evils such as lip syncing and mistaking glam rock for heavy metal. I enjoyed the cliche filled predictable story. The seasoned veterans of the film seemed to have enjoyed making this production as it lacks any seriousness. I spent most of the movie waiting for the talking to get over and the next song to begin. My biggest problem with this film was believing the character of heavy metal rock star Stacee Jaxx which rhymes too much with Terry Jacks (Seasons in the Sun). The could have done better.PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 f-bomb, no nudity other than butt cheeks. There are a number of suggestive/kinky scenes, such as a spanking, undressing, a near grope, stage dancing, and near or suggestive sex. A little too adult for the kids, a little too immature for adults. The heavy PG-13, near R rating may save it.",Rock of Ages
4,kosmasp,Great music,6,12 August 2012,"I really can see, why quite a lot of people dismissed this movie. If you at it from a story point of view, it is really bad. Don't watch it because of the story. Watch it because of the songs. Of course even those might make you cringe (Tom Cruise singing ""Pour some sugar on me"" by Def Leppard to name one), because of the performer in the movie and your personal feelings towards that person.If you can free yourself of those thoughts and you think you are able to enjoy the rock music this movie delivers, than you might like the movie. I know you could simply buy the album or just listen to the songs and I'm probably just too drawn in by the music. But then again, I'm not the only one who feels that way. Be aware what you expect from this ...",Rock of Ages
5,tavm,I got a great '80s rock vibe just experiencing Rock of Ages,9,17 June 2012,"See Catherine Zeta-Jones as a mayor's wife crusading against Rock 'n' Roll and Stacee Jaxx in particular! Watch Tom Cruise as Jaxx! Delight in Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand singing ""Can't Fight this Feeling Anymore"" and acting on it! Get touched by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta's romance! And enjoy the Hell out of the great '80s rock songs and power ballads that dominate the whole movie! Really, while watching with my movie theatre-working friend, we were truly feeling the whole vibe of relieving our teenage years listening and partly singing and just swaying to the Top 40 hits of that time getting all nostalgic about that whole era. So on that note, Rock of Ages ""ain't lookin' for nothing but a good time, and it don't get better than this""...",Rock of Ages
6,michaelRokeefe,"Imagine ""Glee"" raping 1980s rock.",2,31 December 2012,"This is a silly and much too long connivance trying to add more glory to the sound of rock in the 1980s. A young girl from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sherry Christian(Julianne Hough)gets on a bus to Hollywood searching for fame as a singer. On Sunset Strip she meets Drew(Diego Boneta),who works in a legendary bar that gave rise to rock god Stacee Jaxx(Tom Cruise). Drew is just waiting for his turn to take the spotlight. Sherry and Drew befriend each other as they pursue their dreams of fame and fortune. The music of Foreigner, Def Leppard, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, Poison, Twisted Sister, Bon Jovi and others are performed (speaking loosely)by Hough, Boneta, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cruise, who has all the attitude and posturing down flat. Out of all these stars, I was most impressed with Malin Akerman, who plays a reporter for Rolling Stone trying to get a five minute interview with Jaxx and ends up getting laid. That's rock and roll, baby! Others in the cast: Paul Giamatti, Erica Frene, James Martin Kelly and Dan Finnerly.",Rock of Ages
7,sunwarrior13,It's All About 80's Music,8,17 October 2012,"Rock of Ages is a musical comedy that is an adaptation of the rock jukebox Broadway musical of the same title by Chris D'Arienzo. It features country singer Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta leading an ensemble cast that includes Russell Brand, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Malin Åkerman, Mary J. Blige, Kevin Nash, Alec Baldwin, and Tom Cruise. The film presents the music of several 1980's rock artists including Def Leppard, Journey, Scorpions, Poison, Foreigner, Guns N' Roses, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, Bon Jovi, David Lee Roth, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, and many others.It is directed by Adam Shankman. It tells the story of small town girl Sherrie and city boy Drew, who meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. Their rock 'n' roll romance is told through the heart-pounding hits of many 80's musicians mentioned in the previous paragraph.There's not much of a plot, but the music is really the star, as well as the great supporting roles of the supporting ensemble cast. Everyone in it looks like they're having a blast, and that feeling is contagious, especially if you love the music. Some parts of the film don't seem to know if they are supposed to be played in earnest or ironically.With characters bursting into song whenever life gets too tough, the peppy, earnest and often cheesy vibe is substantially more Glee-like than you might imagine.Also,its exuberant silliness is almost enough to make up for its utter inconsequential purpose, but it is ultimately too bland and overlong to justify its trip to the big screen.",Rock of Ages
8,preppy-3,It was great until Cruise shows up,7,25 June 2012,"This takes place in 1987. Small town girl Sherrie (Julianne Hough) goes to Hollywood to make it as a singer. When there she meets sweet Drew (Diego Boneta) who is also trying to be a singer. They fall in love. Then Tom Cruise pops up as Stacee Jaxx (a heavy metal rocker) and the movie falls apart.The movie starts right off with people singing 1980s songs at any given moment. Now I LOVE 1980s music. Personally a lot happened to me in that era--I went to college, moved away from home, came out and got a full time job. So I recognized and loved the songs. Also Hough and Boneta are attractive actors who can sing. Their acting is just OK but they aren't given much to work with. Even Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand (who I usually hate) were good. I was grinning and enjoying every song that came on. Then Cruise appears and the fun just drains away. Cruise simply can't act. He spends the whole part acting drugged out and/or drunk and speaking every word slllooooowwwwwlllly. This is supposed to be funny? His singing (I have my doubts that it was really him) was adequate at best. He was boring and obnoxious and for some reason he has a pet baboon (??????) I suppose that it's supposed to be funny--but it isn't. A long interview section between him and Malin Akerman was particularly bad.But when he wasn't on it was great. The songs were well-done sung with energy and full of great dance numbers. A highlight was Catherine Zeta-Jones and a bunch of church ladies belting out ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"". And then there's battle sequence between two groups--one sings ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and the other belts out ""We Built This City"". The basic story between Hough and Boneta was totally predictable but they're both likable actors. So, Cruise aside, I really liked this. Because of him though I can only give it a 7.",Rock of Ages
9,zardoz-13,Celebrating the Spirit of Rock and Roll!!!,8,25 June 2012,"""Hairspray"" director Adam Shankman's cinematic adaptation of the 2006 Broadway juke box musical ""Rock of Ages"" qualifies as a predictable but entertaining tear-jerker enhanced by an oldies soundtrack of Top-40 hits. Watching this agile musical comedy romance is like attending a concert, except instead of Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister, Steve Perry, Poison and Europe warbling their own songs, we get Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Russell Brand singing them. Lip-synching or not, the cast performs the lyrics well enough to make you want to tap your toes, clap your hands, and perhaps join in on the vocalizations. Of course, the old-fashioned, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl back love story that brings everything together is sheer hokum.Although Tom Cruise is billed last in the opening credits, the ""Mission Impossible"" superstar steals ""Rock of Ages"" from young, star-crossed lovers Diego Boneta and Juliana Hough. They represent the usual, dewy-eyed hopefuls who pour into Hollywood each day yearning for the success, fame, and immortality. Unfortunately, despite their sympathetic personalities', Boneta and Hough emerge as cosmetically captivating cookie-cutter hero and heroine. You know from the get-go they will survive the trials and tribulations that they encounter and come up none the worse for all the wear.Meantime, Cruise is the only character with shades of depth, and he isn't afraid to ridicule the larger-than-life character of veteran rocker Stacee Jaxx. Oddly enough, when he stars in his own movies, Cruise is serious, straightforward, and as shallow as the ""Rock of Ages"" leads. Here, Cruise delivers a performance brimming both with bravado and abasement. In the movies he doesn't produce, Cruise has fun skewering his image as well as playing outlandish characters. Remember that obnoxious Hollywood producer that he played in the war epic parody ""Tropic Thunder?"" Cruise is every bit as hilarious there as he was here. Even if you hate him, you'll enjoy the way that he skewers himself without mercy, while looking cool in a cretinous sort of way.""Rock of Ages"" opens in 1987. Tulsa, Oklahoma, native Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough of ""Footloose"") has packed all her autographed classic rock albums—we're talking vinyl—and has boarded a Greyhound for Hollywood with the dream of becoming a rock and roll starlet. No sooner does our cute heroine hit Hollywood than a low-life hits her. He steals all her albums. A bartender's assistant, Drew Boley (Diego Boneta of ""Mean Girls 2""), consoles her about the loss of her valuables. Later, Diego manages to land her a job at the popular Sunset Strip nightclub called 'The Bourbon Room."" The owner, Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin of ""The Departed""), hires Sherrie against his better judgment. Dennis detests young girls yearning to yowl their way to stardom. Something that he sees in Sherrie prompts him to make an exception. Sherrie assures Dennis that she can waitress with the best.Meantime, Dennis is struggling to keep the doors of The Bourbon Room open. He owes a mountain of unpaid taxes. Dennis's right hand man, Lonny (Russell Brand of ""Get Him to the Greek""), believes that rock and roll will save them. Dennis doesn't share Lonny's optimism. Ultimately, Dennis decides to book rock star sensation Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise of ""Risky Business"") because the veteran rocker plans to go solo. This engagement will mark Stacee's last show with his band Arsenal. Indeed, Dennis and Stacee go back years. Stacee got his start at The Bourbon Club and praises Dennis as a 'survivor.' The news that Stacee Jaxx will play at The Bourbon Room comes at the same time that Los Angeles conservatives are poised to launch a campaign against Dennis' night club. L.A. Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston of TV's ""Breaking Bad"") is under pressure to clean up the Sunset Strip. As it turns out, the mayor's secret weapon is none other than his trophy wife Patricia (Catherine Zeta-Jones of ""No Reservations"") who is spearheading a massive church protest against ""sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll"" image. Patricia and her fervent supporters turn out in droves to condemn not only The Bourbon Room but also Stacee Jaxx. According to Patricia, Stacee Jaxx spews ""sex, hateful music, and sex."" Ostensibly, Patricia abhors the rocker because he seduced her roommate at UCLA and took advantage of her.As the crowds assemble outside, chants and protests mingle in the evening air. Dennis dreams about the mint that he will make until he learns that the act scheduled to open for Stacee Jaxx has bowed out. At the last minute, Dennis agrees to let Drew and his band warm up the house for three songs only. Earlier, Drew had lamented to Sherrie during a romantic encounter at the famous Hollywood sign that he suffered from stage. Fright. Now, he fears the paralysis will strike the next time he climbs on stage. Miraculously, Drew sheds his fears and lights up the crowd, so much so that the man who promotes Stacee Jaxx, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti of ""Shoot'em Up""), wants to make him famous. At this moment, Drew catches a glimpse of Stacee Jaxx adjusting his jeans as Sherrie turns away from him.Director Adam Shankman and ""Tropic Thunder"" scenarist Justin Theroux, original Broadway musical writer Chris D'Arienzo, and ""Just Go With It"" scribe Allen Leob keep things lively. Each song punctuates the plot and serves as commentary either about the predicament or occasion. The variety of songs captures the hard-rocking, long-haired 1980s when rock ruled. Everything about ""Rock of Ages"" is nostalgic, especially the way it ribs the boy bands. Occasionally, the filmmakers allow a glint of reality, such as when our heroine winds up pole-dancing. The choreography is nimble as well as interpretative. Aside from the rather obvious love story, ""Rock of Ages"" contains two other romances. Stacee Jaxx plunges for a ""Rolling Stone"" reporter, and Lonny and Dennis discover why they love to sing duets. ""Rock of Ages"" celebrates the spirit of rock and roll without wallowing in its decadence.",Rock of Ages
10,grantss,"Initially unimpressive, but gets better",6,23 August 2015,"Works, just, somehow. Was initially very unimpressed: I hate musicals and this seemed like a movie-length version of Glee (the episode- length version of Glee is bad enough). However, it does grow on you. The plot is threadbare, and predictable, but the movie does have an energy and momentum that makes it easy to watch. The music helps too.Another positive is the all-star supporting cast. Lead roles are by unknowns whose performances are so-so (though I really don't mind seeing Julianne Hough!). No, it is the supporting cast that give the best performances, but what did you expect with names like Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bryan Cranston and Malin Ackerman, plus Mary J Blige for some musical credibility. The faded rock star is the most interesting character, and is well-portrayed by Tom Cruise, who seems positively in his element in the role.The only negative with so many names is that some hardly have any screen time. I felt that the talents of Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were wasted.Overall, better than first expected.",Rock of Ages
11,Boba_Fett1138,A weak story that is not focused enough.,5,26 June 2012,"No doubt this movie was an attempt at bringing back the good old fashioned rock musical to the big screen but it really for most part is being a failed attempt.I didn't expected a full blown musical but make no mistake about it; this is really a musical, in which its characters occasionally suddenly burst out into singing. It's not exactly my favorite thing to watch but as it turned out, this was actually the least problem I had with this movie.The singing and music in the movie is actually quite good and also what makes this movie still somewhat enjoyable to watch. Granted that there are a bit too many songs in it at times but overall I can't really complain or so many bad things about it.The foremost problem of this movie remains its script, that is being far too formulaic and simplistic. Besides, it has too many different characters in it, with as a result that movie can feel a bit messy at times and most definitely not focused well enough. It's also a problem that its main story is about the least interesting out of all the different stories and the same goes for its two main leads, played by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta.Yes, the movie has so many big names and great stars in it but yet it decides on featuring two big unknown in the leading roles. They just aren't very interesting or fun to watch and besides their whole love thing just wasn't all that convincing. Why do these two persons fall in love exactly? There just isn't really enough chemistry between the two of them and they seem more focused on performing their songs.The supporter cast, with actors such as Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Paul Giamatti, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bryan Cranston involved, is definitely way better and is still what's saving the movie and keeping it a somewhat fun and watchable enough one. But again, there are just too many characters in this movie, which each their own thing going on and it also doesn't help much that every actor in this movie acts as if she/he is in their entirely own movie. It makes some of the plot lines and characters also feel terribly out of place, which also can be said for its humor.You could say that the movie its humor is being a bit too goofy at times, which also can be blamed on its lazy writing, that was uninspired and without any true original or creative moments. It also all really makes the movie feel needlessly overlong. There just was no good reason for this movie to be about 2 hours long and they could and should had shortened it with at least 30 minutes.Not horrible or a movie that I hated but there is nothing about it that is being ever truly great or successful at what it is trying to achieve.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rock of Ages
12,george.schmidt,Less than dazzling adaptation of the Broadway hit musical; severe case of Hollywood bloat with big named talents largely wasted in this '80s era time warp,6,22 June 2012,"ROCK OF AGES (2012) ** Diego Boneta, Juianna Hough, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bryan Cranston, Paul Giamatti, Malin Akerman, Mary J.

Less than dazzling adaptation of the Broadway hit musical with big named talents largely wasted in this '80s era time warp boy-meets-girl (varying degrees of vanilla and plastic provided by largely miscast Boneta and Hough) while employing the jukebox tunes of hair bands and hard rock as the Greek chorus for the dreams of fame and success along LA's Sunset Strip including Baldwin (looking at a quick unfunny paycheck turn with bad wig extensions) as a former rocker turned club owner trying to save his business with a deal with the devil in the form of snake-hipped Axl Rose manqué Stacee Jaxx (Cruise proving his commitment in his intense, low-key fun performance; the only one GETTING it!) while politico crusader ala Tipper Gore, Zeta-Jones tries to put the hose on everyone getting their ya-yas out.

13,neil-476,"Preposterous nonsense, and thoroughly enjoyable",8,15 June 2012,"Meet the cast: Sherrie (Julianne Hough) is an Oklahoma girl coming to the big city in pursuit of fame and fortune; Drew (Diego Boneta) is a barman (and hopeful rock singer) at hotspot/live gig venue The Bourbon Room; Dennis (Alec Baldwin) owns The Bourbon Room, and Lonny (Russell Brand with a dodgy Birmingham accent) is his personal assistant; Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) is the mega-successful frontman of Arsenal, just about to go solo, Paul (Paul Giamatti) is his slimy manager, and Constance (Malin Akerman) is a Rolling Stone journalist doing an article on Jaxx. The final characters of interest are Justice (Mary J Blige), proprietor of a pole dancing club, and Mike and Patricia Whitmore (Bryan Cranston and Catherine Zeta-Jones), the Mayor and his wife, who want to close The Bourbon Room because of its seedy influence on The Strip (although Patricia may have ulterior motives).This fairly large ensemble cast goes through what, to be frank, is a series of utter clichés - the young romance, the casual sexual encounter, the misunderstanding, the falling on hard times, the couple who realised that they were in love all along... We've seen it all before.But we haven't seen it done against a background of metal anthems. I was intrigued and engaged when Sherrie bursts into song on the bus into LA and, not only do none of the passengers react with surprise or irritation, they join her. Ah, so it's going to be that sort of movie.This film is utterly daft (and frequently somewhat mucky). But the characters are pleasant enough company, the musical sequences are well done, all the cast sing their own songs, and it is worth the price of admission to see Cruise as Jaxx, a performance completely unlike anything he has ever done. The main story coasts in on the shoulders Hough and Boneta: Boneta is amiable enough, if lightweight, but Hough does it for me big-time. She is not only gorgeous with a smile which lights up the screen, she does innocent and sexy (at the same time), plus she sings and dances well.Yes, it's daft, but it is often funny (the production number for the couple who realise they've been in love all the time is a hoot), and I left the cinema with a big smile on my face.",Rock of Ages
14,ferguson-6,Not Gonna Take it Anymore,4,17 June 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. A few upfront disclosures are in order: I spent quite a few evenings on the Sunset Strip during the era of this story; I had no idea who Diego Boneta was and only vague name recognition of Julianne Hough when I walked in; and I never saw the hit Broadway production. These points may help explain my reaction to the movie.The opening sequence immediately informs us that we are in for something different. Aspiring singer Sherrie Christian (Ms. Hough) is running from her backwoods Oklahoma life to the bright lights of fame offered by Hollywood. While on the bus, we get the first of an endless stream of staged karaoke routines ... ""Sister Christian"" (get it??). Once on Sunset Boulevard, she is quickly mugged and then comforted by Drew (Mr. Boneta), an aspiring singer and current barhop at The Bourbon, an obvious nod to such hallowed rock ground as Whisky A Go Go and Roxy.No need to spend much time discussing plot. There is a muddled love story filled with teenager dreams and miscommunication, and a financial crisis at The Bourbon, thanks to back taxes owed by manager Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin), and a political backlash against the club thanks to the Mayor's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has a not so secret need for revenge. The only way to save the club is for rock idol Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) to play a gig. The only way to save the love story is to write it out of the film all together. The political agenda is simply an excuse to add two more excruciating karaoke numbers.What little fun there is in the movie is thanks to Cruise, Baldwin and Russell Brand, who plays Baldin's sidekick and confidant. Cruise jumps into the Jaxx role with both feet and seems to understand that a parody should be fun. Being a rock idol isn't far removed from being the biggest movie star on the planet, so Cruise blends Axl Rose and Bret Michaels to create Jaxx ... throw in a pet baboon, two He-men bodyguards, an endless train of groupies, and a dragon codpiece ... and you get Stacee Jaxx, legendary rock star.If one is going to make a rock 'n roll movie, it either needs to be played straight (Almost Famous) or as a head-on parody (This is Spinal Tap). What it can't do is celebrate the dead zone of lameness: lame music covered by lame singers playing lame characters. No amount of star power actors can overcome material that doesn't capture the power and passion of the music. And we aren't even talking real rock n roll here ... this is glam rock, stadium rock, big hair bands. Yet, the movie still falls incredibly short of making a statement or providing insight or even entertainment.Cruise's performance generates some laughs, as do Baldwin and Brand. However, Hough and Boneta aren't even cringe-worthy. They have no screen presence and neither belong in a rock movie. Maybe the real problem is that most of the songs in the movie have survived these 25 years because of their mediocrity ... they can easily be sung while intoxicated. Evidently that's not enough for a decent movie.",Rock of Ages
15,anaconda-40658,Rock On Nostagia!,9,2 July 2015,"Rock of Ages (2012): Dir: Adam Shankman / Cast: Diego Boneta, Julianne Hough, Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin: Nostalgia sets in with its 1980's music galore set in 1987 as Sherri Christian arrives in L.A via bus with dreams of becoming a singer. She accepts a job as a waitress at the Bourbon nightclub where rock icon Stacee Jaxx is set to perform before undergoing a solo career. She also encounters Drew working the back bar area with dreams of fame and stardom. While this all may sound familiar, the period tunes performed by the cast are amusing and electrifying in one. As with Hairspray, director Adam Shankman proves to be most comfortable with musicals, and presents an energetic ensemble cast that is pitch perfect for the satiral tone. Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough travel the same road as seen in the mediocre Burlesque, but the difference here is their transformation in the representation of where music was headed. Tom Cruise rules the screen as the sly presence of Jaxx whose presence intimidates and impresses with his sexual delusions and inner struggle of core importance. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the feisty vocal Patricia Whitman, wife of the Mayor and leads protests against the Bourbon, and in particular, Stacee Jaxx. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are hilarious as owners of the Bourbon who fret over taxes and the outside protest. They also share one of the best laughs in the film all to the tune of REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling.""

The story is simplistic so the different locations on film help give some breadth to the story.The cast is well chosen. The 2 fresh faced charming leads Julianne Hough and Diego Boenta are charming and talented. Catherine Zeta Jones is good and Russell Brand is convincing. Alec Baldwin is a bit weighed down looking.

Rock of ages has the usual sing, dance, lovers fight, and save the theater musical storyline. I was ready to leave! However, Tom Cruise's charisma saves the movie. Cruise's portrayal of a strange burned out rock legend is entertaining and funny. Not the best movie this summer, but not the worst either! Six stars out of ten.

He delivers a fearless, uninhibited performance, that ranks amongst his finest to date.'Rock of Ages' Synopsis: A small town girl and a city boy meet on the Sunset Strip, while pursuing their Hollywood dreams. 'Rock of Ages' is good in parts, not in totality. Although its a pleasure to hear the vintage music, the story isn't strong enough. Justin Theroux, Chris D'Arienzo & Allan Loeb's Adapted Screenplay could've been more persuasive. Adam Shankman's Direction is credible. The Songs are beautifully sung & re-composed. Performance-Wise: Obviously, Cruise dominates the show completely. In the supporting cast, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Bryan Cranston, Catherine Zeta-Jones & Malin Åkerman, are good. On the whole, 'Rock of Ages' may not be the best musical, but Cruise re-invents himself & comes up a big winner.",Rock of Ages
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Rock you like a hurricane!,6,8 July 2012,"Growing up, one of my favorite things to do was to listen to music. I was born in 1985, so from a young age, my parents liked to listen to all the 80's rock. To this day, I still have Scorpion, Bon Jovi, Journey, Montley Crue, Def Leopard, Van Halen and AC/DC in my car among others. I don't know what it is about rock/heavy metal music, but it just gets in your blood and makes you want to party like no one ever has. I'm not the only one that feels this way obviously, this genre of music still has an extremely loyal fan base and you see all the time on VH1 a show dedicated to the rock music of the 80's. It seems like the past 10 years have been a ""what a great time we had in the 80's"" flashback, from the fashion to the music to the movies to the colors, we notice certain trends coming back. Of course the music that everyone still loves so much was eventually made into a musical called Rock of Ages. I've been dying to see it, but keep putting it off, so naturally when I heard that they were making the movie, I was already excited to see it. Well, I've found out why the musical hasn't hit Broadway just yet.In 1987, Sherrie Christian travels to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a famous singer while barback Drew Boley prepares for another night of work at ""The Bourbon Room,"" a popular nightclub on the Sunset Strip. As Sherrie approaches The Bourbon, her suitcase, containing her favorite records, is stolen. Seeing the incident, Drew comforts Sherrie and, upon learning of her situation, he gets her a job at the Bourbon Room as a waitress. The club's owner, Dennis Dupree, and his right-hand man, Lonny Barnett, are trying to find a way to deal with unpaid taxes that are threatening the club, wishing their love of rock 'n' roll could keep it alive. They finally decide to book Stacee Jaxx, a famous rock star who has recently announced that he will be resigning from his band, Arsenal, to perform at the Bourbon in hopes of raising enough money to clear up their debt. Upon hearing of Jaxx's upcoming concert, Patricia Whitmore, the religious conservative wife of Mayor Mike Whitmore, organizes her church to protest in front of the Bourbon Room, planning to shut them down in an attempt to rid L.A. of its ""sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll"" image.The good in this film mainly comes from Tom Cruise's performance who looks like he just had the best time making this movie. Bringing in a mixture of Axl Rose and Keith Richards, constantly being late, making no sense, new girl every 10 minutes, but still somehow has this insanely great talent that could sell records no matter what reputation he has, Tom was just great and very funny. Alec Baldwin is always great to watch and I even like Russell Brand, but there's this strange ""joke/revelation"" between them that I won't give away that just didn't work very well. The two leads Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough were cute, but a little too after school Disney show romance for me. But they did perform very well. Catherine Zeta Jones and Paul Giamatti play the one note bad guys with no real motivation other than reputation and money, that's it. It's just been done to death a million times with this story that I wish they would've done something a little more creative with these songs. I do over all like the movie and it's energy, but it could have been so much more, otherwise it just sounds like I've gone to the bar with a bunch of drunks singing karaoke butchering Don't Stop Believin'.6/10",Rock of Ages
21,blanbrn,Fun film that brings back memories it pays tribute to the best times the 1980's!,8,30 June 2012,"Having grown up during the 1980's and having been a fan of hard rock love songs and some heavy metal music I just knew I would have to see the ""Rock of Ages"" film. And after watching hearing all of the 80's music played during the film it brought back memories to that time period! Interesting is how the film has each character to sing an 80's song, as the song to is fitting with what's going on in the character's life at the time! That's so good for a musical to do! Also this film's theme aside from paying tribute to the music and times of the 80's also has focus on finding love and success.Set in 1987 Los Angeles on the Hollywood Sunset Strip a young want to be singer arrives in town and this little gal named Sherrie(Julianne Hough who's gives a sexy turn)finds that stardom and dealing with love is tough as the same can be said for her want to be lover and aspiring singer Drew(Diego Boneta). The film also blends some laughs and drama as it's cast is all pro Alec Baldwin is a good supporting player as gay club manager Dennis Dupree who's goal is to put partner Lonny(Russell Brand)in charge. As shown in the film and it can be remembered with the 80's the right wing political and religious folk fought rock music they felt it was evil and Catherine Zeta Jones struts it up as Patricia Whitmore the sexy crusading L.A. mayor's wife who's against rock music. Most memorable is Tom Cruise as the frosting on the cake as hard rocker Stacee Jaxx he reminded me so much of Axl Rose! Overall good film that pays tribute to 80's rock it's nice hearing those sounds and it was a feel good time when those tunes blend with a search for love and success.",Rock of Ages
22,KineticSeoul,A comedic rock musical that shouldn't be taken seriously,6,23 July 2012,"Few minutes into this movie I thought I was going to hate it. But it starts to get corny and doesn't take itself seriously at all and for some reason those elements make this movie work. That and if you watch it with the right audiences that know how to make the right comments with roasting included without disturbing and annoying everyone and laugh at the right parts. This movie is basically a musical with couple of popular rock music from the 80's thrown in. If you grew up during that era chances are your going to like this movie even more. If you don't like 80's music you might not enjoy this movie as much. Some critics complain about the music choices for this flick but I thought it fit in with the story pretty well with the lyrics and all. The acting in this movie is pretty darn corny without being awful but that is also one of the reason why this movie works because it knows which direction it wants to go and doesn't try to take itself seriously. Julianne Hough never stood out in movies for me until now, the girl has talent. I am not sure if she was being herself but she plays the cute and perky role really well as Sherrie. Wouldn't mind seeing her in other future roles. Now I didn't like Diego Boneta in the beginning but his character grows on you as the movie progresses. Never really liked Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin but they are actually likable in this. Tom Cruise doesn't really seem to be acting in his role despite his Axl Rose style attire. Maybe that is why he fit right into his roles and adds a bit of humor to it all. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also good as one of the main protester against rock and roll. If you like 80's music and can handle a bit of corniness and not take this movie seriously you just might have a good time with this.6.5/10",Rock of Ages

Although I am a fan of some of the songs sung in the movie, including Catherine Zeta-Jones' ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot,"" the acting in this movie was horrible and the plot was very plain, which was about two aspiring singers named Drew and Sherrie chasing their dreams in Los Angeles. When they meet, it's love at first sight. It dragged on and on with no ending in sight.Julianne Hough's Sherrie Christian character was very annoying, especially her voice. It seemed she strained her voice when she sang, trying to sound Brittany Spear-ish or like any female pop-singer. Alec Baldwin looked like an idiot in the movie and Tom Cruise's performance was very artificial and pompous.I also think that this movie sends out a wrong message about pop music ""poisoning"" people's minds, especially youths.

24,Hellmant,"A good time at the movies, if you like musicals or possibly more importantly butt rock!",8,26 June 2012,"'ROCK OF AGES': Four Stars (Out of Five) Big screen adaptation of the popular 'rock jukebox' Broadway musical about two young lovers trying to find happiness and fulfill their dreams while working at 'The Bourbon Room', a successful nightclub on the Sunset Strip, in Los Angeles in 1987. It's filled with popular hits from 80's glam metal bands (like Journey, Poison and Bon Jovi to name a few) and all of the film's stars did all of their own singing. The movie stars Julianne Hough (of 'FOOTLOOSE' and 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' fame) and Diego Boneta as the two young leads and also features supporting performances from Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Russel Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Malin Akerman and Tom Cruise. It was directed by Adam Shankman (who also directed the 2007 musical remake of the John Waters' cult classic 'HAIRSPRAY') and written by actor Justin Theroux and Chris D'Arienzo and Allan Loeb. The movie works both as a funny comedy and an upbeat musical if you're a fan of the genres.Hough stars as Sherrie Christian, a young aspiring singer who travels from Oklahoma to Los Angeles (in 1987) hoping to find fame. Boneta plays Drew Boley, another aspiring musician working as a barback at 'The Bourbon Room' on Sunset Strip. When Drew sees Sherrie for the first time they fall in love immediately and Drew offers to help Sherrie get a job at the club. The club owner, Dennis Dupree (Baldwin), is reluctant to hire Sherrie but due to the fact that another waitress quit the same night he agrees. Dennis and his best friend Lonny (Brand) have been struggling to keep the club open while trying to fight off debt in taxes as well as protests from religious conservatives lead by Patricia Whitmore (Zeta-Jones), the wife of the Mayor (Bryan Cranston). Dupree pins all the clubs' hopes on a big show by rock superstar Stacee Jaxx (Cruise). The whole time Sherrie and Drew try to follow their dreams and keep their relationship intact.I enjoy musicals if they're well made and if I like the music. One of the most important parts of a musical is you like the music (who wants to see a musical filled with music they hate?)! With this one I definitely enjoyed the music and the film as well. It's extremely humorous, has a ton of upbeat energy and the performances are all topnotch. Cruise does steal the show with his iconic rock character but Giamatti, Baldwin and Brand are all at their usual best as well. I didn't care for Boneta at all as the young male lead but he didn't ruin the movie for me and Hough is lovely and beautiful once again (as she was in last year's 'FOOTLOOSE'). The directing is fitting and the script is clever. It's just an all around good time at the movies, if you like musicals or possibly more importantly butt rock.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsBLwhWUQjM",Rock of Ages
25,bowmanblue,"Like High School Musical, but with more rock music",6,15 December 2014,"Let me start by saying that I probably shouldn't be reviewing this, as I'm biased against it from the start. You see... I have a daughter who has made me sit through the entire High School Musical trilogy about a hundred times. That sort of trauma taints anyone's perception of musicals.Basically Rock of Ages (is based on a theatre musical, but I haven't seen that) tells the story of a small town American girl who moves to L.A. in pursuit of her dream of becoming a singer. When she gets there she falls in love with the first annoyingly handsome young man she meets and they sing a lot.Every scene had me thinking of High School Musical. Granted, having 'rock and roll' as the subject matter meant there are certain 'adult themes' associated with rock and roll which were never included in HSM, but it is basically a love story with clichéd characters set around rock music.Okay, so with me expecting Troy and Gabriella to pop up at any moment, I was never truly going to enjoy this film. But the rock music is certainly good (if you're a fan of rock music, which I am) and Tom Cruise puts in a surprisingly good performance as a rock superstar.All in all this probably isn't for everyone. Musical lovers will enjoy it the most. Fans of rock might get something out of it. And anyone who grew up in the eighties will get a nice kick out of the detailed nostalgia they have for the time period. Personally, I'm so sick of musicals I was destined not to appreciate this as much as I should have done for the start. Damn you Ryan and Sharpay.",Rock of Ages

Blige and Catherine Zeta Jones. Quite frankly, the other actors shouldn't even have tried to sing. Tom Cruise just can't perform a rock show. Julianne Hough is not a good singer and even worse actress. She wasn't given much to work with, but I don't see any qualities about her that make her a lead in a film. But she was worse in Footloose. ""Hey Man"" about stole the show from everyone. And when a monkey is the best character, you know you don't have much to work with.FINAL VERDICT: If you love rock songs from the 80's, it's fun to hear them again.

Sure there was a lot of negative things occurring that decade, but one thing that isn't is the 80's rock and roll. I'm glad they made the hit musical, Rock of Ages into a film because it tells a story of living the rock and roll dream can how people can rise from nobody to somebody. The film adaptation is a great movie because it's funny, it accurately describes the look and feel of the 80's, has a great cast, and last but not least it's rocking out with all my favorite 80's classics.Adam Shankman's film is not only a musical, but also a nice romantic comedy. It's essentially about a bar dude named Drew and an out-of-town girl named Sherrie whom fall in love with each other in the craze and stardom of Hollywood.This film boasts a great, multi-talented cast. The best performance no doubt belongs to Tom Cruise. It's nice to see him expand beyond his wheelhouse and do something different. He has a really good singing voice and between all the drugs and sex, he does a great job. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta are good in their roles, perhaps a little bit substance needed. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand have great scenes together, including this one scene no one would see coming. Also, a nice bonus is seeing Paul Giamatti playing the sleazebag role very well.Overall, this is one awesome film because it's full nonstop with your favorite rock and roll. With covers ranging from Def Leppard to Pat Benatar to REO Speedwagon, this film has it all. The story itself may be a little weak, but that's only when there is no music. The acting is good enough to make the story seem better though. I really loved the set design and how this film surely looked like 1985. I rate this film 9/10.",Rock of Ages

I found them all so refreshing and you just wanna dance the whole night long! I have to admit, I thought the band that Drew was set up with, we're just too much to listen to cause really you heard it all before.

When Drew gets his big break opening for Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) their paths and relationships start to change, and not for the better. Before I start this (in case you don't already know) this is a musical so if you are not into musicals you can stop reading. On the other hand all the music is from 80's hair bands...so that is pretty rad. I will say that this movie is easily the most clichéd musical I have ever seen. Girl lives in small town, moves to big city, instantly gets robbed but is helped by a boy who immediately gets her a job at the place she wanted and they fall in love...a misunderstanding causes a fight...yada yada yada. To be honest the movie is almost too cheesy to watch, but the music keeps you involved. The entire soundtrack is songs by 80's hair bands.

31,tabuno,A Musical For The Age?,8,17 January 2019,"17 June 2012. Overall, this movie rocked and perhaps that's the problem, Rock of Ages is for the aging film-goers. Even though I was pulled into the music and the nice smooth and very apt script plot lining up with the rock lyrics, apparently the general public has moved on to another generation and another musical genre. Yes this movie had a few apparent weaknesses, the noticeable imbalance of the number of exciting and fun dance numbers/routines that diminished as the movie went on, Catherine Zeta-Jones prolonged absence from film, and the rather odd, clashing musical lyrics with the more hot and heavy sex scene on the billiards table that really failed to capture the essence and meaning of the music and the crucial theme of the scene. However, this musical brought to life in exciting, strong performances the inner substance of rock. Alec Baldwin, Tom Cruise, and Catherine Zeta-Jone with what she was given came out in sterling characterization with a solid script solid. The gay scene may or may not have been a generational problem for those lived through the 80s and of course those more younger film goers embracing homosexuality may have more likely than not stayed away from this aging rock movie.What is intriguing is that Rock of Ages when placed along side the more narrow offering of the Beatle's range of music available to Across the Universe (2007) that movie had as great and powerful reception and even more epic scope (Vietnam War) and was better reviewed but made way less money. Almost Famous (2000) while less of a musical than a movie about a person who loves music, still is considered a classic that made relatively little money at the box office. Rather in contrast to either Chicago (2002) or Moulin Rouge (2001) instead Rock of Ages plays more like West Side Story (1961) in its presentation. Missing is the more atmospheric setting and period of time of Paris or the richness of the life and death story of crime and passion, the basis of much of the operatic, melodrama of many Broadway Musicals. In a way, Rock of Ages is its own movie genre not based on a musical production, but based on editing together a great musical era of its generation with a movie storyline, along with a plethora of dance choreography.",Rock of Ages

It's a shame because I had enjoyed his 2008 musical Hairspray, but this one doesn't work at all. It tries too hard to be funny, but it just felt lame. The first 30 minutes are terrible, the film then picks up thanks to Tom Cruise but it just seemed to drag on forever. The movie may have one of the best soundtracks of the year and that saves it, but that is about the only thing I enjoyed of Rock of Ages. There are a couple few funny scenes but they are too far spread out and like one of the character's sings near the end ¨the movie keeps on going on and on.¨ I didn't like that the producers decided to put the words of the song during the musical like if it were a karaoke bar, but I guess a lot of people liked it and it worked for them. I'm just giving my personal opinion and I didn't think it worked really well as a movie. There were a lot of similarities between this movie and Burlesque, another film I didn't like very much but is much better than this one. Musicals haven't worked out really well in the past few years (Burlesque and Nine), and it's a shame because with films like Chicago, Moulin Rouge, and Dreamgirls it looked like this genre was going through a revival period. Sherrie (Julianne Hough from the Footloose remake) is a small town girl from Tulsa, Oklahoma that is pursuing her dream of becoming a singer and therefore is moving to Hollywood. Once she arrives to the big city she is introduced to a new world and from the moment she sets her foot in Hollywood she is robbed. But not everyone is a thief in Hollywood and she finds help from a young man who's also aspiring to become a rock star. His name is Drew (Diego Boneta) and he immediately helps Sherrie by helping her get a job at the same place he works at: the Bourbon Club, famous for having launched Stacee Jaxx's (Tom Cruise) career as a rock star. Jaxx is at the pinnacle of his career and is thinking of going solo. He will be presenting his last concert with his band at the Bourbon Club run by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin). The club is having some financial troubles, but the concert will put it in the map again. Not everyone admires Stacee Jaxx however, as the mayor (Brian Cranston) and his wife Patty Whitmore (Catherine Zeta Jones) want to clean the city by closing down the famous club responsible for so much immorality. Other important characters in this musical include the talents of Paul Giamatti as Jaxx's manager, Russell Brand as Dennis's best friend and work partner, Mary J Blige as a strip club owner, and Malin Akerman as a Rolling Stones magazine reporter.There is not much more I can add about this review but say that Tom Cruise gave yet another good performance. I also liked the young Diego Boneta who I hadn't heard about before. He has a decent career ahead of him. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are always funny and shared some funny moments together. Julianne Hough is beautiful but she didn't seem to fit the part in this film. I didn't like her very much in Rock of Ages. My main complaint has nothing to do with the cast, I just think it was poorly directed and scripted. The film has some great music, but that is about it. I wouldn't want to watch this film again and couldn't recommend it to anyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Rock of Ages
40,davispittman,Hit me with your best shot!!,7,9 March 2015,"This movie is not flawless, but it is very energetic and fun. If you hate 80s music, then you might as well stop reading this now, cus from beginning to end it's 80s rock music. The sound of the songs in the musical numbers are incredible!! Very sharp and well sung by all the actors, some that I had no idea could sing! Catherine zeta jones was probably my favorite part of the whole movie! She was loads of laughs and fun. It did drag for just a bit in the middle, but it quickly picked itself back up, because the ending is one of my favorite endings in a move ever!! This flick is definitely not for the whole family, but I think the teens and adults will like it. Especially people who grew up in the 80s.",Rock of Ages
41,3xHCCH,Tom Cruise Succeeds as a Rock God!,6,14 June 2012,"It is 1987. Sherrie (Julianne Hough) rides a bus from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Los Angeles, California to fulfill her rock and roll dreams. On her first night in Hollywood, her idealism was shattered when her luggage with her precious rock music records were stolen. She meets struggling musician Drew (Diego Boneta), who helped her get a job in THE legendary rock club on the strip called The Bourbon Room, run by odd couple Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny (Russell Brand). Sherrie could not have come at a better time because The Bourbon Room has booked her idol, rock superstar Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise), to play his final gig with his band Arsenal before going solo. Also on Stacee's case are the mayor (Bryan Cranston) and his rabidly anti-rock wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), his oily manager (Paul Giamatti) and Rolling Stones reporter (Malin Akerman).The actors really give it their cheesy all in their singing and acting. Julianna Hough and Diego Boneta were charming and good singers as the central couple, but they were upstaged by the senior stars, particularly Tom Cruise. Cruise plays a character so far off from the type anyone thought he would or could do. I had my doubts when I heard he would be doing this role and doing his own singing to boot. This was a very physical role for Cruise as he hardly had wordy lines to say. He had the aging rock star look down pat, shirtless and drunk the whole time. I can imagine Steven Tyler like this when he is not on American Idol! However, if you watch and listen to Cruise's performance of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me,"" you'll really believe that he is indeed a rock god! Not too successful though was Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose scheming Stepford-wife-type character was poorly written and executed.Some songs fit right in, some songs were pretty awkward. The musical mash-ups were very well done. The popular TV series ""Glee"" has robbed this movie of surprises since it obviously got its inspiration from this musical play, particularly the finale number ""Don't Stop Believing,"" a song which remains to be ""Glee""'s biggest hit. Many of the songs in ""Rock of Ages"" have also been sung on ""Glee."" (Was it coincidence too that Director Adam Shankman also directed a couple of ""Glee"" episodes""?) The song that got the most riotous audience reaction though was REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling,"" which I will never hear in the same way again after the hilarious scene where it was sung here. OK, the story is not the main attraction here. The multiple intersecting story lines were all Hollywood clichés -- small town girl going to the big city to find her luck; boy meets, loses and gets back the girl; an old business institution on the brink of financial ruin; stripper madame with a heart of gold, jaded star gets a wake-up call, etc... -- you name it. Scenes of sexual, alcoholic and drugged debauchery (mostly by Cruise), which I guess you cannot really separate from a movie about rock and roll, may make some members of the audience uncomfortable. This movie is not for young kids at all. But the mixing in of very popular songs, most of them Number 1 hits, made this fun and entertaining for 80s like me. As a kid of the 1980s where glam rock anthems and power ballads ruled the music scene, I really enjoyed and was singing along with practically all the songs in this movie. By some strange twist of chance, we are set to watch a local musical theater production of ""Rock of Ages"" tomorrow night. It would be interesting to see how those two versions compare.",Rock of Ages

For the record, Tom Cruise though the biggest name of the cast, really is NOT the star. As his role is a rare supporting role.The main protagonists are Julianne Hough and Diego Bonta. Who prove both have great acting and singing skills. As young lovers who fall in love at the height of the 80s rock era. Trying to make it in the rough and very cutthroat world of LA.The strong supporting cast is Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand(say what you will about him as a person but he is a riot!), Catherine Zeta Jones as a mayor's wife against rock and roll, and Bryan Cranston as the mayor, Jones husband.Story is OK but not good but not bad.

44,jadepietro,Crock of Ages 2,1,21 June 2012,"I went to the the film adaptation of the Broadway show, Rock of Ages, and was completely underwhelmed. The film never soars, despite its energetic dancing and pop rock score origins. It has no edge and no soul. The film becomes a thankless series of musical numbers strung together to form a simple story that tries to satirize the 80's but rarely succeeds. It's a mess! ￼This being a musical, the most important element is the songs, not the scenery. And Rock of Ages has its emphasis in reverse, spending too much time on atmosphere and fashion and too little on its production numbers. The film's classic soundtrack becomes bland, passionless imitations of former hit tunes that lose their hard rock sound and drive, mutating into a dreary conglomeration of mainstream white-bread musik one could readily hear in an elevator. Everything is overproduced and sanitized for its PG-13 rating. ( No evidences of drugs or substance abuse during this era? Only alcohol consumption and sex? Really? ) Much of the casting is just plain bad. The one redeeming grace in this graceless movie is Tom Cruise as singing idol, Stacee Jaxx, who literally gives a full-bodied musical performance. Other actors can't sing ( Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Russell Brand, and Malin Akerman ) or fare less well in their poorly written roles ( Julianne Hough, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J. Blige, and Diego Boneta ). Most are unintentionally funny due to a miserable script by Justin Theroux, Chris D'Arienzo, and Allan Loeb ( three people? ) that lets everyone down. ( Baldwin, Brand, and Akerman come off the worst and blame must also go to the director, Adam Shankman.) He may be a fine choreographer ( although the usually talented Mia Michaels did that disservice ), but Shankman still needs lessons in directing as many scenes go on far too long and embarrass his trusting cast, and oddly have no rhythm or pacing and...but I'm rambling, aren't I?So let me end this review with a direct quote from some of the movie's atrocious dialog which succinctly sums up my movie-going experience after seeing Rock of Ages: ""I just threw up...in my pants...out my ass!""

45,rgkarim,Rock On!,8,17 June 2012,"When you think of Tom Cruise what comes to mind? International Spy? Samurai with a saki Problem? Fugitive from aliens? Well to my surprise the man of many roles adds another character to his repertoire, which is the fictional singer Stacey Jaxx. If you are like me, you have never heard of this name, but as I found out from my Organic Professor Cruise's newest movie Rock Of Ages is based off of a Broadway show. While the show is quite popular, I had my doubts about seeing another musical come to life on the big screen, especially with Cruise taking a lead singing role. What are my thoughts on this movie? Keep on reading to find out.The plot of this movie for those of you don't know centers on Sherrie Christain (Julianne Hough) a country girl with a big dream of making it big in 1987 Hollywood. She arrives to find the city to be much harsher than expected and quickly meets Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) a local bar worker. The two of them soon start their adventure to fame that involves multiple characters, all of them with a story tied to none other than Stacey Jaxx (Tom Cruise). Let's start this review off on a positive note by talking about the music of this movie. Now in the past musicals have not been the strongest movies, High School Musical 3 and Glee: The Movie being prime examples of failure. However, in Rock of Ages the team managed to do the famous song justice to bring the 80's music into the modern world. Unlike a certain television show, Rock of Ages focuses more on musical balance by adding actual music to the number, instead of just relying on voices. Even on heavy singing numbers there is a nice blend of voices instead of just one singer taking all the spotlight, which I liked. I was impressed with the integration of classic rock guitars, pace setting drums, and dynamic voices that resulted in one heck of a soundtrack. However, I must admit that it's amazing how good a studio team can make a person sound, as some of these actors don't have the voice of a singer, such as the Tom Cruise songs. However, other stars like Hough, Boneta, and Blige sounded more natural as they performed flashy, well- choreographed dance numbers. Perhaps what impressed me even more was the timing and placement of the various numbers throughout the movies. Where most musicals fail to find a balance between singing and dancing, Rock of Ages managed to use their music to help emphasize the emotions of the characters while still adding to the story. The second biggest strength of this movie is how well the team captured the lifestyle of 1987. From the design of the crazy outfits to the strobe light infused club scenes, Rock of Ages is a visual tribute to the 80's rock style. I was completely immersed in the world, and felt I was learning about a culture that has long been extinct. What also brought the world to life was the dynamic camera work. Instead of settling on one camera angle to film the concert, the crew kept used varying angles to make one feel like they were at a concert in a club, from both audience and performer side. The editing of the shots and sequences is even blended just right so that every lyric is perfectly lip synced, every intense guitar strum is flawlessly blended with the music, and the dance moves are coordinated with the acting scenes. Despite all the strengths I have mentioned, there are a few weaknesses for me that I wasn't a big fan of. For one thing although the story was a decent love story, or should I say two love stories, there were a few intense sex scenes that weren't to my liking. I can appreciate the cultural references, but for a rock musical I could have done without these scenes, that include the French kissing scenes as well. Although the acting was good for the most part, there was a few times where I found the acting annoying, especially with Tom Cruise's trippy, alcohol infused, mumbled rants. Russell Brand as well is his usual self, but without much variation in his routine, the one liners get a little old with the exception of a few well timed limericks. Despite how much I enjoyed the music, there were a few of their versions I didn't particularly care for, but as luck would have it these numbers were not too long so I didn't have to suffer for too long. Rock Of Ages is definitely one of the better musical movies I've seen in a long time. Instead of being filled with cheesy, teenage dance numbers, and sappy, drama filled love stories this movie has a welcomed balance. With lots of good humor, a fun soundtrack, and beautiful visuals this movie is definitely one I recommend for the theaters. However, for those who don't like the 80's or can't really understand the cultural statement I'll tell you now to avoid this movie. As for those going for a shirtless Tom Cruise will get their money's worth because there is seldom a scene where he is wearing a shirt. My scores for this movie are the following: Comedy/Drama/Musical: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 Check back soon for my next review, and remember to keep enjoying the movies.",Rock of Ages
46,Rob_Taylor,"Seriously, some of you people need to get out more!",10,22 November 2012,"I can't believe the bad reviews this movie is getting. Sure, it will never get any awards, but come on! When I hear people complaining about the plot in a musical I just have to shake my head in disbelief. Wait! Is this a musical? Why yes, it is! So why are people complaining about the plot when the music is all that matters.Do you people not recognize parody when you see it? All I can say is, if you voted this as less than a 6 star movie, then fun hit the highway in your lives a long time ago.RoA is pure fun. It isn't at all serious, It isn't meant to have a deep story. You are meant to switch off your brains and let the music wash over you. If you treat it as anything other than that then you shouldn't be watching it in the first place, you naughty killjoys, you!I lived through the 80's. It was perhaps the best decade of my life, and the worst, but it was never forgettable. Not for a minute. So lighten up and stop complaining about everything. Life is too short.SUMMARY: Fun, fun, fun, fun! Music! More fun! More music! Dancing! More fun and yes, yet more music! Despite the terrible ratings, it IS good if you love the 80's.

47,brando647,The Movie's a Bore but the Music (and Stacee Jaxx) Rocks,7,15 January 2013,"I'm not really a fan of musicals. There are a few I've enjoyed enough to see fit as additions to my collection (e.g. ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) and I've enjoyed some of the old Rogers and Hammerstein films. As a general rule, I don't seem to find much enjoyment in movie musicals for a few reasons, most of which I'll spare you here. But there is one glaringly painful problem I have with movie musicals and ROCK THE AGES happens to suffer from it more than any other musical I've seen: the lip syncing. I hate poorly done lip-syncing and this movie is chock full of it. Right from the start, it's enough to rip me out of the movie. ROCK OF AGES is a musical that I expected to love. The cast was impressive, the music selection was amazing, and I maintain the '80s as one of my guilty pleasures. I was born in the early '80s and so the decade has a pretty special place in my mind. I was really hoping this movie would be a super fun look back at a decade of excess, bizarre fashion, and great music. When the reviews began to roll in and the word was primarily negative, I knew this wouldn't be one to catch in theaters. Instead, I waited until the eventual home video release and I'm glad I did. Based on the stage show of the same name, the movie is about a small- town girl who moves to Los Angeles in search of her big break. She finds a job waitressing at the Bourbon, an L.A. music hot spot, and finds love with an aspiring musician as the '80s and it's music come to an end.The casting in this movie is hit and miss, with a whole lot of misses. Let's start with our leads: Diego Boneta (as Drew Boley) and Julianne Hough (as Sherrie Christian) as our small- town girl and city boy. I have no problem with movies casting unknowns, but these two did absolutely nothing for me. Hough is apparently best known for her time on TV's ""Dancing with the Stars"" and Boneta is a musician/actor popular in Mexico. Hough does well enough but brings absolutely nothing extra to her role (aside from a fine singing voice and some pole-dancing talent), which is a shame seeing as how she's the female lead. Boneta is just horribly miscast. Drew is supposed to be an aspiring rock star. He's supposed to embody '80s rock-and-roll and the passion of the music. Instead, he's a pretty boy that looks completely out of place. Watching him try and put on a rocker's attitude and strut around on stage, slinging a guitar, is laughable. He seems more at home in the '90s boy band parody Z Guyeezz in the later half of the movie than at any point when he's trying to be Wolfgang von Colt. The best hope is the supporting cast and, for the most part, they do a great job of saving what of the movie they can. With one exception: Alec Baldwin. Baldwin can be funny, and he has some good material here. But he just doesn't fit. He comes off as an old man trying to run with the cool young crowd, and the little singing he does is cringe-worthy.The rest fare pretty well: Catherina Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti, Malin Åkerman, Russell Brand (who looks completely at home in the movie), and Mary J. Blige (one of the most talented vocal talents in the movie, for obvious reasons). The best part of the movie by far is Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. I never would've guessed Cruise had it in him to play a rock legend, but the man is awesome. Jaxx is the best part of the movie and, if the whole movie had been focused on his character, it would've been a million times more entertaining. Cruise may be a weird dude in his personal life but the guy's got talent. Cruise is given the chance to perform songs by Bon Jovi, Guns N Roses, the Scorpions, and Def Leppard and he pulls them all off perfectly with rock star flair. Which leads me to the best part of the movie: the music. With bonus points for some creative choreography, the music is the only reason to check this movie out. Any fans of the '80s rock era will love the soundtrack to the film. I would've given the movie a lower rating but I can't help but enjoy the movie, especially when I'm not really paying attention to it. The best way to watch this movie is to let it play in the background and just enjoy the tunes.",Rock of Ages
48,bkrauser-81-311064,Dreck of Ages,1,6 December 2013,"New Line Cinema and Warner Brothers wants you to know something: they hate you. They have no respect for you and they want your money. This is the message I received loud and clear while watching Rock of Ages (2012) this last week; a movie as foul and unnecessary as the innards of my garbage disposal. But lets back up a bit.Now for those of you who aren't familiar with the Broadway show let me lay some knowledge on you. Rock of Ages is a Tony nominated jukebox musical about a small town girl (Julianne Hough) ""living in a lonely world"" who comes out to L.A. for her big singing break. Once there she gets a job as a waitress at an infamous rock club thanks to a pretty boy bar-back (Diego Boneta) who, of course, wants to be a rock star. The club however is on the verge of bankruptcy and is being protested by local politicians played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bryan Cranston (You read that right Bryan Cranston). To stop the bulldozers from leveling the place, bar owner Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) is putting all his cards on ""legendary,"" but unreliable rock star Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise).I can see the movie's creators pitching the idea to investors thusly: its the perfect date movie. A heartfelt romantic comedy for the ladies, set to the tunes of 1980's classic rock for the fellas. Oh and its also PG-13 which means its diluted enough to entice the young who didn't grow up in the age of vinyl and those old enough to remember protesting outside of Def Leppard concerts. While I don't know enough about the musical to assume the same of it, the film feels like a sorry assemblage of compromises. What is a strip club without nudity? What is rock and roll without sex or drugs? What is a love story without love? This movie.All these plot devices and processed, squeaky-clean camp are the perfect ingredients for a mediocre movie ala Footloose (1984). But there is no redeeming this clunky, overlong waste of marquee space. The movie is simultaneously exhausting and boring. Not five minutes goes by without someone belting out a song and yet the plot has no sense of urgency so you basically sit there waiting for the song to end and the plot to begin. The songs themselves rarely fit the characters, mood or circumstances. What does Foreigner's ""Jukebox Hero"" have to do with losing your vinyl collection, Twisted Sister's ""Were not Gonna Take It"" have to do with shutting down a club or Bon Jovi's ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" have to do with anything? Furthermore the choreography consisted largely of actors walking in front of colored lights while extras walked behind them. I guess the days of Fred Astaire and Gregory Hines is over replaced by the days of Julianne Hough climbing a stripper pole and hanging perfectly still.And what of the love story? You know that one thing that should drive the plot but plays second fiddle to three other uninteresting subplots? Well you know how in every romantic comedy there is that ""complication,"" where two thirds into the movie one person takes the others words or actions out of context, resulting in a twenty minute brooding period that's resolved by the time the credits roll? Yea, that happens. And it happens in such moronic way that I honestly felt these people did not deserve happiness.Rock of Ages was down right insulting. At no time they attempt to honor the actual ethos of rock and roll, give a shout out to the people who wrote the songs they were butchering or even try to tell a discernible story. The best you can say about it is that it's like watching decent karaoke. But lets face it, unless you're the one up there singing, you know its better just to listen to the real thing.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Rock of Ages

Strutting around with his youthful physique and taking the stage in a parody of rock idols, Cruise appears to be having a ball. The trouble is, there is too little satire and too much dwelling on the saccharine love story unfolding on the stage of the ""Bourbon Room"" on Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Nevertheless, there are some good laughs as Cruise's sex appeal is mocked and the cast dances and sings to some old favorites nicely rendered: ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot,"" ""I Want to Know What Love Is,"" and ""Don't Stop Believin'"" among them.

There are more songs than dialogues and that makes it unbearable for even people like me who likes good musical movies. I don't know what Adam Shankman was thinking, just take all the big actors and put relatively new good looking stars in the middle we will have a blockbuster musical? Well he was wrong any good movie musical or art needs good story and most importantly screenplay. This one has a good cliché yet a story but no screenplay at all. Everything happened and moves ahead with songs and songs and songs. There is defiantly few fun hot numbers with Tom Cruise, Malin Akerman and Julianne Hough but a tedious movie makes it hard to enjoy these hot dance numbers. Two main lead actors were totally miscast Tom Cruise and Diego Boneta. Tom Cruise tried his best in looking the Rock N Roll phenomena Stacee Jaxx but when he is not singing aggressively his slow motion talking didn't make any sense at all. The Spanish or Mexican Diego Boneta may hold some scenes on TV with his good look but he could not carry the whole movie at all. He is not only acted with mediocrity but sung with mediocrity as well. His Spanish/Mexican accent can easily be seen and made it like a parody. Julianne Hough was good in Footloose but here she tried her best in bad direction and at times screechy singing she could not help much though she tried to cover up her sexy stripping dancing. Catherine Zenta-Jones was alright, though unnecessary loud at times. Bryan Cranston, Paul Giamatti, Russell Band and Alec Baldwin couldn't do much with it, though Alec Baldwin and Russell Band's Kiss has to be the LMFAO moment.

52,napierslogs,"Comedy, singing and rock Gods, but it's not the musical of the ages",6,15 June 2012,"Tom Cruise channelling Axl Rose? I am so there. It has been rumoured that Cruise's inspiration for his fictional character Stacee Jaxx came from the Gun's N Roses front-man. After seeing ""Rock of Ages"", I'm pretty sure we can claim that is a fact. Everything that we expected out of this movie was there. Cruise was undeniably the rock God that we have always wanted him to be, and our small town girl and city boy sang and danced to their hearts' delight.That being said there was definitely something missing. Perhaps more '80s rock songs, and probably switching up the main roles were needed. Nobody will take this to awards glory like Constantine Maroulis' Tony nomination from the original Broadway production. As cute as the small town girl (Julianne Hough) and city boy (Diego Boneta) are, they don't have the charisma that the stars need. The stars with the charisma don't have enough to do. I have now realized that I have always wanted to see Alec Baldwin as 30 Rock's Jack let his hair down and put on a pair of jeans, but he doesn't need a love interest for the sole purpose of adding in another joke.Remember that this is a musical so the most that anybody does is sing, a lot. These aren't so much characters as standardized movie archetypes. That being said the supporting actors were fleshed out with minimal scenes. Catherine Zeta-Jones was established as the ball-busting Christian wife during one of the best musical numbers where she choreographed her intention of grabbing Jaxx's testicles and ripping them from his body. Bryan Cranston plays her almost-castrated husband, but don't worry he's never as innocent as he seems.I have had the pleasure of experiencing Rock of Ages live, and although this larger-than life movie version is certainly big, and fun and flashy, it doesn't quite take you back to the 80s where you dreamt of love, fame and fortune.",Rock of Ages

54,PartialMovieViewer,Fun Time with Little Story-line,8,29 June 2012,"This movie is centered around a music era I had very little interest in (the late 60's and 70's were more my music speed and not the 80's – I mean - there wasn't any rock produced in the 80's – right?). Well, this was my paradigm and I was going to stand by this no matter what. Of all my personal self-proclaimed life-standards, my attitude towards music was probably the most steadfast. I was so dedicated to that view. Prying me out of my comfort zone was going to be very painful, and possibly even dangerous. Also, there was no way kicking and screaming was not going to be involved. Well – that is what I thought before seeing the movie, and now I must humbly eat crow. Just a side-note: I noticed people who saw the play and, later, the movie, were attempting to male some kind of comparison between the two. I wish I could have that kind of insight, but I have a very limited patience with the play-goer class. They are usually people I cannot relate with but I can accept and respect their views. Back on track now! I had reservations about seeing the movie. I knew Tom Cruise would be at least very good, and would more than likely be counted on to carry the entire movie. Most of the actors I did not know. With Russell Brand, he did OK, but I can't relate to his humor and I think American movies have enough Australians and British in them now (not saying they are bad – just saying plenty of American actors are out of work. Oh and Alec Baldwin – I really dreaded seeing a movie with him in it. I really expected to cringe every time the man opened his mouth. And now for a second helping of crow. Mr. Baldwin did a fine job. He may be warped in other areas, but he does have talent and a very good sense of comedic timing. As far as other performances – can I criticize them – sure! If it wasn't for the main star, I think this movie would earn a flop grade from me. Oh yeah – did I mention that the 80's had some pretty good rock music? If you missed what I said earlier – those youngsters from the 80's put on some really kick-butt performances and played some pretty sweet tunes (I mean I am listening to Joan Jett right now). I mention the music now, because, that was the main star of the movie. This was a fun movie, with a strong cast. The story was weak – but who cares? Is there room for a sequel? NO WAY! Please don't. Like the 50's, 60's 70's, 80's and 90's – they are done – RIP. Let them go.",Rock of Ages
55,Quietb-1,Summer Camp,6,18 June 2012,"If you like musicals this is for you. If you like bad dialogue and unneeded exposition this is also for you. It would have been better if they stuck to songs to tell the story rather then stop the movie in it's tracks for two character conversations on top of the Hollywood sign and elsewhere.The young stars come off as just that and seemed not quite ready for the big screen. Alec Baldwin looked uncomfortable in his tight jeans. Russel Brand stole every scene he was in. Katherine Zeta-Jones is a tea bag dropping in here and there. Tom Cruise moved in slow-mo. It looked like nobody wanted to get to close to the monkey ""Hey Man"".At times the movie has a pace and style but it seems to start and stop. It is loaded with clichés. Ignore logic, reality, and the fact Los Angeles never had a Channel 6 News. You know it's going to have a Hollywood ending, exactly what you want from a feel good musical. Keep your expectations in-check and enjoy this campy fluff.",Rock of Ages
56,bankofmarquis,Skip the movie - see the show,6,25 January 2015,"I was not a big fan of this movie when it first came out in 2012. Perhaps it was because I am not a big ""Metal Head"", perhaps it was because I felt the performances were forced, not organic. Perhaps I just didn't like the story. So, when it came on TV yesterday, I thought I'd give it another shot.I still didn't like it.Why? To begin with, as stated above, I was not into the the ""Hair Metal"" of the '80s, so only a handful of the songs in the show made me sit up with a wry smile on my face. Secondly, the story is paper thin (but that can be forgiven in these types of ""Jukebox"" musicals - see MAMA MIA). But for me the biggest sin of this movie was the acting. Juileanne Hough and Diego Boneta are bland and forgettable as the two star crossed lovers at the center of this musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Russel Brand were doing their own thing - certainly not acting in the same movie with each other and the others in the cast, but it was the stunt casting of stars Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise that was the most at fault. These two ""play acted"" as Rock Stars throughout. They didn't bring any reality to the fantastic in this show and I didn't believe either of them for a minute. Only Paul Giamatti acquitted himself well in the rather one dimensional role of Paul Gill, the slimy agent.Finally, this movie suffers from what many other movies that were made from Broadway Musicals (Rent, Jersey Boys, Into the Woods, The Producers, to name a few) suffers from - a lack of intensity and raw emotion that you can only get by watching these performances live. Instead of being drawn into the show, I felt like I was standing behind a glass observing the show.And that, at the end of the day, stops this one in it's tracks.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Rock of Ages
57,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An epic comedy/musical with lots of great 80's music!,8,31 January 2013,"During the summer of the past year, my brother went to see this by himself while I went to see Pixar's Brave (great film, btw) with my cousins. After we watched those films, he wished I would've been there to see it with him since he liked it. So, later, during Christmas near the end of 2012, we both got this movie on our DVD copies and hoped that we might watch it. I watched it and was enthralled by it. OK, it's not an excellent film, but it's one of the better ones (The Hunger Games, John Carter, The Avengers, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, etc).The story, based on the musical, is pretty much epic with an original love story and some comedic bits that would make you either chuckle or laugh. The characters, although utilized, are likable enough and has a great cast of actors. Catherine Zeta Jones is sassy as the mayor's wife, Alec Baldwin is great as Dennis, Russell Brand is a wise-cracking Lonny and Mary J. Bilge did fine as Justice, but Tom Cruise steals the show as the steel rocker Stacee Jaxx. His character is hilarious and enjoyable to watch. I think there isn't anything to fault the romance between Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta which was very cute.The direction from Adam Shankman (the guy who borough us ""Hairspray"") is fine, the look of Los Angeles is a sight to see and it has a great camp value, but the best part about the movie would have to go to the usage of the 80's music songs which are by far memorable to listen to.Overall, Rock of Ages isn't exactly the best movie of the year, but like I said before, it's one of the better ones despite it's mixed reception and I'm recommending this to those who grew up in the 80s and to those who haven't seen it. Go watch it! It's that good!",Rock of Ages
58,Christian_Dimartino,"Nothing' but a good time, and it don't get better than this.",8,28 June 2012,"I don't have a problem with musicals, as long as the songs are enjoyable. Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Grease, Moulin Rouge, Chicago, and Sweeney Todd are all masterpieces, where as Annie and The Music Man are painful. I like musicals, like Moulin Rouge and Mamma Mia, that contain songs that everyone knows. So, in short, I had a blast within the opening five seconds of Rock Of Ages.The film revolves around Sherrie(the adorable and sexy Julianne Hough) who is on her way to Hollywood in search of fame. As soon as she gets there, she meets a nice guy named Drew(Diego Boneta) who gets her a dream job at The Bourbon Room, a bar that has all her dream rock stars performing. He's also searching for fame, and soon the two fall in love. A lot of the film revolves around the couple, and how they aspire for fame.That portion is cute, but the other moments are irresistible and hilarious. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand play the owners of The Bourbon Room. Bryan Cranston is the mayor of L.A., and his wife(Catherine Zeta-Jones) is trying to take down rock-n-roll, mainly because of a secret she holds. Malin Ackerman is a journalist, who cuts to the core of Stacee Jaxx, and Paul Giamatti is Jaxx's manager.Now the main reason why I went to see Rock Of Ages, was not because of the songs(I love most of those songs, and the actors perform them well). It was for Tom Cruise. Cruise, who is one of Hollywood's greatest talents, is rock god Stacee Jaxx. As Jaxx, Cruise steals the show. As a cross between Jim Morrison and Steven Tyler, Cruise is ridiculous and hilarious. You can't take your eyes off of him. In the best performance i've seen so far this year, Cruise is awesome. He's funny, he's bizarre, and damn can that man sing.Sure some of the songs are cheesy, there are a few moments that don't work, and it goes on for too long. But I had a blast. I love the songs, the actors seem to be having a good time, the film is really funny. Director Adam Shankman(Hairspray) really brings out the 80's colors, and nails it. Rock of Ages is a pure dazzler. I had a lot of fun.B+",Rock of Ages
59,Laakbaar,"Raunchy, campy, cheesy, schmaltzy, over the top -- and thoroughly entertaining",8,24 June 2012,"I was quite entertained by this movie. I'm not sure why it only gets 6+ on IMDb.com, but don't let that dissuade you from seeing it.The musical is essentially a compendium of rock oldies from the 1980s, but put together to tell a story. (This is also what they do to Abba music in Mamma Mia.) The music is well performed. If you're a fan of rock music from this decade, you'll really enjoy this movie. I particularly liked the scene where the two sides are lined up: one singing ""We Built This City"" and other ""We're Not Gonna Take It"".As in Mamma Mia, the story line in Rock of Ages is rather contrived and schmaltzy, but it was good enough to keep the movie rolling. The theme of the movie is chasing your dreams -- perhaps not always in the way you imagine -- but also daring to love if you're fortunate enough to have it come your way. The director of this movie also directed Hairspray, so it's going to be a little campy and cheesy at times -- but in a good way.This is quite a raunchy movie. It was over the top but a lot of fun. As usual with American movies, very little T&A, despite the theme.It's very much a movie that idealizes Hollywood and the Sunset Strip rock club scene. The performances in this movie are fantastic. Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx is worth the price of admission alone. What a performance! Who would have thought Tom Cruise could play a rock god? You'll have to see it to believe it.The young couple are capably played by Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough. Both of them are great performers and very easy on the eyes. Alec Baldwin, Russel Brand and Catherine Zeta-Jones are over the top and just hilarious. This movie had a lot of laughs.I suppose this movie is not for everyone, but I enjoyed it and I would recommend it.",Rock of Ages
60,TheSquiss,"Rock of Ages was put on this earth for those in need of some good, cheesy, ridiculous fun.",6,16 July 2012,"The films of Tom Cruise have so far earned Hollywood close to $8 billion! There's a very good reason for that. Last year, Tom Cruise personally earned $75 million for two films: Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and Rock of Ages. Not bad going for a movie star who's been headlining films since 1983's Risky Business. He may not have an Oscar yet, though three nominations, 3 Golden Globes and 34 other awards aren't to be sneezed at, but there's no denying he's just about the biggest star Hollywood has ever produced. And that came in handy when they cast him in this.Cruise slots into Rock of Ages perfectly. He's a megastar playing a megastar, he's had his fair share of troubles and bad press and is playing Stacee Jaxx, a character who is also staggering through a, hmmm, challenging period of his life. Beyond all of that, Cruise suits both the part and the film because, whilst serious about his work, he doesn't take himself too seriously. In Rock of Ages, Cruise, though not the principal star, is evidently having a lot of fun playing a part that's at least an arm's stretch away from himself and avoiding the traps that many lesser actors would fall into. Yes, he plays it big, as the part requires, but he doesn't play it false. He's expansive but not ridiculous and as believable as you want in a film such as this.There's no great depth or surprise to the plot, though it helps to have lived through the 80s and have an embarrassed recollection of the hair, fashion and soft rock anthems, all of which are offered copiously. It's a feel-good, dance in the aisle romp where girl (Sherrie, played by Julianne Hough) goes to the big smoke in search of herself/love/excitement, meets boy (Diego Boneta), suffers a bought of unfair judgment, loses boy, finds her way, gets boy again. Hurrah.Throw in Paul Giamati as Jaxx's manager, highly-strung bitch/minx Catherine Zeta-Jones and a vaguely comedic double act from Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand and you have a pretty fine cast with their tongues almost protruding from their cheeks. A scene in the final chapter with Baldwin and Brand singing Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore does nothing to dispel the feeling that we've just taken a trip through a retrospective rock panto, and that's not actually a bad thing.Written by Justin Theroux (cousin of Louis, nephew of Paul, actor in such tosh as Wanderlust and Your Highness and the man responsible for the screenplays of Iron Man 2 and the forthcoming Zoolander 2), Rock of Ages offers few surprises other than that Tom Cruise can sing, but that isn't the point. Don't hand over cash and expect to be blown away by gut-wrenching emotional outpourings and inspirational soliloquies but relax in the confidence that it's a heck of a lot more entertaining than Mama Mia.The star of Rock of Ages is undeniably the music. You know every song, you've sung most of them into a hairbrush or imagined yourself hurling them across a packed stadium, albeit back when you, too, had the hair and physique (or at least the shoulder pads) but it's also here, with the music, that director Adam Shankman let's the side down. He appears to have had a checklist of BIG songs to place in the film and instructed Theroux to write the screenplay to include the titles with nary a thought for the content of each song.But that's nitpicking. If you want something that makes sense and exercises the brain this absolutely isn't the vehicle. Rock of Ages was put on this earth for those in need of some good, cheesy, ridiculous fun with smidgen of sex but nothing to raunchy to shock anyone over the age of 12.Just make sure you have something suitable to listen to on the drive home afterwards. In the absence of good 80s rock in my car, I settled for The Darkness, which isn't that far removed from the sentiments of the film.",Rock of Ages

This is a world where several actual bands don't exist since our fictional characters have written their songs (from Def Leppard's POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME to GNR's PARADISE CITY to Journey's DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'). That includes primadonna rock star Stacee Jaxx About to quit his longtime band he's got one final gig at the club – but only if he sobers up.Tom Cruise portrays the eccentric rocker with a sincere yet ridiculously brooding machismo, walking with a slither and taking himself much too seriously. His scenes, including one in which Rolling Stone reporter Malin Akerman's interview becomes a sexual romp, go on too long and it's never quite clear what's behind his erratic behavior. But does it matter? Catherine Zeta-Jones savors the antagonist role as a religious zealot trying to shut the place down at all costs and she, like everyone else including club owners Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand, take part in musical numbers that never cease.Yet with all the glitter and glamour it's Hough's dreamer Sherrie that brings this corny fable down to earth; what little story exists, she keeps going.Reminiscent of musicals like SGT PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND and XANADU, here's a musical unashamed to be exactly what it is: a guilty pleasure.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",Rock of Ages

I haven't seen the stage musical as the prices they were asking in New York when I was there were ridiculous for anything like a good view, so I can't compare this to the stage version, but it seems the stage version is much better.

65,ethanbresnett,Lots of good intention but poor execution,6,14 May 2021,"There's a lot to love and enjoy about Rock of Ages. Like most musicals, it has a great buzz and electric feel to it. You can't help but finish this film with a big smile on your face and its a very feel good comfort experience.The production value was also great, from the sets to the costumes, everything felt realistic and just looked cool.Then there's the key part of any musical, the songs. You can't fault the selection, there were numerous classics which just kept on coming. Maybe a little too much.I couldn't help but feel like there were just too many songs. There wasn't any time to take a breather and the story wasn't allowed to develop outside of the music. As a result I couldn't find myself connecting to any of the characters and I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunity to develop the plot and characters because of the amount of songs.This wasn't the only problem with the plot... it was all over place. Was this film about Sherry, Drew, Stacee Jaxx, Patricia, Lonnie and Dennis? Who knows. There was too much sharing of the spotlight, and the constant changing of perspectives and protagonists started to give me whiplash. I think things would have benefitted from having a more obvious and clear protagonist to root for and follow, which would have given the film more drive and direction.I also had mixed feeling about the characters. What Russell Brand was doing with his sporadic Brummie accent I'll never know. He's never been a great actor, and the accent just made everything so much worse. The two ""main"" characters of Sherrie and Drew were also pretty bland and I wasn't that fussed about them. Tom Cruise on the other hand, what a surprise. Easily the best thing about this film. He threw himself into this role and it massively paid off. It's worth watching for him alone.Finally, as much as I liked the selection of songs, the singing wasn't always on point and was quite obviously auto tuned to a heavy extent for some of them. I think musical films need to start finding a better balance between casting big names to get bums on seats, but also casting actors who can sing.Rock of Ages is definitely fun, and any musical lover will find lots to enjoy here. I did however find it to be quite messy and overcrowded with one dimensional characters and too many songs. Lots of fun, but not a great film.",Rock of Ages

I haven't laughed this hard in ages. For those who expected something serious, when Tom Cruise literally sang into the butt of a woman, that should have been a giveaway that this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. I think the problem most people have is that it's all played with such a straight face that it's not obvious this is a comedy. It also helps if you are familiar with the music, even better if you grew up with the music. For those who complain the cast doesn't sing as well as the original artists, that's the point. All these songs exist these days only in karaoke bars. That's part of the fun. Did the guys from Wayne's World sing Bohemian Rapsody as well as Queen? It seems with this one you either get it or you don't. I can see, if you don't get it, how this can come off as one of the worst musicals of all time.

68,kdnor2011,Mostly a Bore,4,15 October 2012,"I'm not someone who has a major interest in music. Don't get me wrong, I like listening to music, but it certainly isn't my passion. So of course musicals aren't my favorite genre of film. Not to say there aren't ones I like and even love, but I can't say that I had very high expectations for this movie. Especially with all the negative reviews I had heard about it. But I was willing to give it a shot, I mean, classic 80s hits, an 80s movie feel, it could be fun.This was dull, it was just a dull experience. Way too long, not very funny, boring characters, and a cliché plot. I actually think there are way too many songs in this movie. I know it's a musical, but literally a song will end and then 30 seconds later a new one will start. This wouldn't be so bad, except the songs are so forgettable. The songs themselves aren't bad, of course most are classics, and the singers aren't bad. But most of them just aren't fun, it's hard to explain. I'd say there are three, maybe four songs that I said ""Yeah, this is kind of fun,"" and even shook my head to them. But the rest I'd say, just listen to the original song. The characters are mostly forgettable, and Tom Cruise phones in his performance. I could tell how the movie would end half way through, exactly how it would end. It's not very funny, it has it's moments, but mostly it takes itself way too seriously. And because of that, it becomes a boring film, and at almost two hours long (over that including the credits) it becomes almost unbearable at a few points.What was good in the movie? Well, Catherine Zeta Jones was pretty enjoyable. She was one, out of like five villains, and she was pretty over the top, and has the best song in the movie (Hit me with your Best shot). And her part in the ""we built this City/We're not gonna take it"" was pretty fun. It's looks nice, it has kind of an 80's feel, I wansn't there so I couldn't tell you, but it seemed pretty 80'sish. And like I said, they're are some fun songs, and some funny moments.But for the most part it is just a bore. Part of me thinks I would actually hate this movie if I had a passion for music because the songs are so forgettable. I didn't hate this movie, but I just wanted it to end. Really, with the exception of those few songs, there wasn't too much to enjoy. Maybe I'm wrong about the music passion thing, maybe if you really love 80's rock music you will love this, but I found it to be a bore for the most part.3.5/10",Rock of Ages
69,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Rock of Ages (2012) - USA,6,19 June 2012,"Tom Cruise. Mr. Tom Cruise is simply amazing. In fact he is the only reason why this movie should be watched. Believe me; his performance here is exhilarating, different, rock-like and totally awesome. In essence, Cruise is easily unrecognisable and the manner he is able to electrify the big screen makes Rock of Ages totally watch-able. Without being over-bearing, ""Rock of Ages"" is an average movie that never raises above its musical genre clichés. In fact, it is actually filled with all the predictable clichés of puppy and stop-start love plot line. However, the reason that the film is better than it should be, can simply be attributed by a long list of strong supporting cast that goes on like a shopping list in Hollywood.In leading roles are two young guns and romantic leads in the form of Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough. Their love of rock music brings them together and eventually predictably put them apart at the same time. While both kids are rather raw in their acting, they are both likable and have enough justifiable presence along with a good singing voice to boot. However, both are only able to manufacture emotions and the result is the audience never really connecting with the duo. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand turn out far better and the sudden twist of storyline provides a welcome laughter moment for the audience. Likewise, Paul Giamatti is always good as the greedy music producer and the monkey is without question along with Cruise the best thing in the film. In terms of females, Malin Åkerman does extremely well as a Rolling Stone's journalist and is able to churn out an hilariously and sexy display. Unfortunately the usually dependable Catherine Zeta Jones turns out the worst out of the pack and incredibly wasted in a role that seems more annoying than funny.All in all, ""Rock of Ages"" is at best an average film that offers nothing new, but is elevated by some fine performances, namely Tom Cruise and a strong cast to boot. Director Adam Shankman is an expert in the musical arena; therefore it is all the more unfortunate that Rock of Ages seems just exactly like ""Hairspray"" in disguise, rather than aiming for something more original and touching. Still, despite all these mediocre phrases, ""Rock of Ages"" starts off slowly, but kicks out the electric presence the moment Cruise steps into play as Stacee Jaxx and never stops beating till the credits began to roll. That's a fine achievement by all means, even if the film never truly deserves it at all. At the end of the day, this is a film where some fun can be had, but ultimately it is really just an empty rock 'n' roll experience (Neo 2012) Neo rates it 6.5/10 -www.thehkneo.com",Rock of Ages
70,Chris_Pandolfi,If Only it Had Been Nothing' but a Good Time,5,15 June 2012,"Adam Shankman's ""Rock of Ages"" reveals the inherent problem with jukebox musicals, namely that story is formulated around songs as opposed to the other way around. In those instances, it typically can't escape coming off as hopelessly contrived (the only exception I can think of is Baz Lurhmann's ""Moulin Rouge""). One can easily give this movie props for its fine collection of rock ballads, its talented cast, and its overall sense of '80s nostalgia. But the screenplay is a mess, repeatedly going off on tangents that are in and of themselves so paper thin that they're practically transparent. Any semblance of character development, of which there is very little, is at the mercy of tiresome personality clichés that rapidly lose their campy appeal. Worst of all, there are precious few instances in which the songs naturally intertwine with the plot; most of them seem to just pop up out of nowhere and end as quickly as they began.If you have your heart set on seeing this film, despite everything I've just said, here are the only three reasons I can muster for you: (1) The soundtrack is loud, head-banging, and infectious; (2) all the praise Tom Cruise has been getting is very much deserved, as he can sing the hell out of Def Leppard and Bon Jovi; and (3) it's nowhere near as bad as the last jukebox musical film, the unwatchably embarrassing ""Mamma Mia!"" For some, it might also help that it's adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name, which earned five Tony nominations. But none of this amounts to very much in the grand scheme of things. On a personal level, it's disheartening that this movie was directed by the same man who helmed ""Hairspray,"" another musical adaptation that was not only exuberant fun but also one of the best films of 2007.Taking place in 1987, the film begins with a young woman named Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough), who travels by bus from Oklahoma to California with hopes of becoming a famous singer. She arrives at the Sunset Strip in Hollywood with starry-eyed optimism, only to immediately have her suitcase full of vinyl rock albums stolen. This doesn't go unnoticed by Drew Boley (Diego Boneta), a busboy whose own dreams of rock superstardom are hampered by stage fright. He works at a nightclub called The Bourbon Room and, out of kindness, manages to get Sherrie a job there as a waitress. The owner and his right-hand man, Dennis Dupree (Alex Baldwin) and Lonny Barnett (Russell Brand), know that unpaid taxes leave the club's future in question. Hoping to generate income, they arrange a concert headlined by Stacee Jaxx (Cruise), an international rock icon. This will be his first solo performance following his split from a hair band called Arsenal.Years of living life as a music superstar have transformed Jaxx into an eccentric, belligerent, alcohol-dependant shadow of his former self. A journalist from ""Rolling Stone,"" the suggestively-named Constance Sack (Malin Åkerman), calls him out on this during a five-minute interview, which ends with a very awkward contextual setting for the song ""I Want to Know What Love Is."" Sensing a shift in the musical landscape, Jaxx's manager, the oily Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti), sets his sights on Drew, who's obviously eager to be famous. By this time, Drew and Sherrie have (1) professed their love for each other, and (2) broken up over Sherrie appearing to have had sex with Jaxx. Sherrie quits her job, only to become a waitress/stripper at a club presided over by a woman named Justice Charlier (Mary J. Blige). At the same time, Drew is groomed by Gill into becoming a member of a pop boy band.Meanwhile, the highly conservative Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta- Jones) appeals to church groups in order to protest Jaxx's upcoming performance and The Bourbon Room itself, which she hopes to have shut down. Her crusade has nothing to do with morality; she has a personal vendetta against Jaxx for reasons I won't reveal. She isn't the only one with something to hide. Her husband, Los Angeles Mayor Mike Whitmore (Bryan Cranston), is having an affair with a political intern. As we will eventually discover, neither subplot amounts to much of anything. The Mayor character should have been removed entirely while Patricia should have had a much more prominent role, given the fact that she's the main antagonist. On the plus side, we are treated to Zeta-Jones' rendition of ""Hit Me with Your Best Shot.""As you can see, this movie is narratively all over the map. It doesn't stay focused on any one subplot long enough for us to fully invest in it. Had the overall plot been narrowed down a bit, perhaps the bountiful selection of songs would have been utilized in a much more effective way. It was wonderful hearing samples from ""Sister Christian,"" ""We're Not Gonna Take It,"" ""We Built This City,"" ""Just Like Paradise,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""Here I Go Again,"" and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me,"" among several others, but never once did they seem like an organic extension of the story; they felt tacked on out of some nostalgic obligation to the audience. The worst song inclusion would have to be ""I Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore,"" sung as an unnecessarily comedic duet between Baldwin and Brand. ""Rock of Ages"" is a musical that's all dressed up with no place to go.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Rock of Ages

72,gregeichelberger,"Head banging, wild ride of a film ...",6,7 June 2012,"""Rock Of Ages"" is ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" with Heavy Metal accompaniment; it's ""Hairspray"" with hair bands; it's ""A Star Is Born"" with a rock anthem soundtrack.It's ""Almost Famous"" kicked up to 11 on the amplifier volume knob.And, if you're into 1980s stadium tunes, this movie is a wonderful time at the cinemaplex. Loud, goofy, outrageous, garish, funny and nitro-fueled, this effort, directed by choreographer Adam Shankman (""Glee"" and ""Modern Family"" TV series) in his feature film debut, and based on the Broadway musical hits all the right notes in its appeal to young and old alike.Written by Chris D'Arienzo and Allan Loeb, the tale is as old as the hills: naive young girl from the Midwest goes to the Big City (in this case, Los Angeles) to seek fame, fortune and, of course, the man of her dreams. Sure, there are up and downs along the way, but the stars usually align and things turn out in the end with stories like this.It's just that in ""Rock Of Ages,"" this plot is backed with tunes from '80s staple artists such as Journey, Poison, Def Leppard, Pat Benatar, Whitesnake, Foreigner, REO Speedwagon, Joan Jett, Warrant, Starship, Twisted Sister, Night Ranger, Bon Jovi, The Scorpions and Quarterflash, among others, and sung (to a better or lesser degree) by the cast.If one cannot tap their feet to THIS soundtrack, one obviously has no feet to tap. Or a head to bang, I suppose ...The plot has pretty and perky Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough, the remake of ""Footloose"") arriving in L.A. in 1987 with just one dream, to see her favorite group, Arsenal, and meet its lead singer, Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise, ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"").Meanwhile, however, her luggage and money are stolen, so she needs to find a job. Thanks to a friendly face, beer boy Drew Boley (Diego Boneta, a series of TV shows, including ""Pretty Little Liars"" and ""90210""), though, she gets work at the Bourbon Club in a seedy, but coveted strip of the city (think Whisky-A-Go-Go).Conveniently (and only in the movies), Arsenal and Jaxx just happen to be coming to play their last gig at this very location in less than a week. Both Sherrie and Drew dream about becoming singing stars themselves, but the former is too timid and the latter gets stage fright.Meanwhile, the club owner, Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin, ""30 Rock"" TV series, ""The Cooler"") and his hyperactive sidekick, Lonny (Russell Brand, ""Get Him To the Greek,"" the remake of ""Arthur"") are looking forward to the concert to recoup club losses and to pay off a large tax bill.When the big day comes, however, Jaxx is certainly in no condition to perform. Whacked, weeded and wigged out on sex, drugs, booze, women and life on the road, he is the burned-out shell of a man who used to write moving and intelligent lyrics.And, during a pre-concert interview with a ""Rolling Stone"" reporter, Constance (Malin Akerman, ""27 Dresses,"" ""The Proposal""), he begins to realize just how empty he really is.Taking advantage of another movie cliché that goes back at least to 1929's ""Broadway Melody,"" the opening act cannot go on, leaving Dennis with no choice but to let the bashful Drew and his band play. Having fallen totally in love with Sherrie and using that as his inspiration, he is no longer afraid to perform.Before he goes on, though, he believes she has had a tryst with Jaxx and in his anger, completely rocks the crowd, but dumps her.Enter Jaxx's sleazy manager, Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti, ""The Hangover, Pt. 2""), who steals money from Dennis, then signs Drew to a record deal, but can only sell him as a member of a lame white boy rap band.Sherrie, in the meantime, has to take a job at a waitress in a strip joint just to survive; while a subplot concerns Mayor Whitmore (Bryan Cranston, ""Red Tails,"" ""Breaking Bad"" TV series) and his rock and roll-hating Tipper Gore-like wife, Patricia (Catherine Zeta-Jones, an Oscar-winner for another big-time musical, ""Chicago"").Will rock rule or will it surrender to the likes of Drew (now Josh-Zee) and his ridiculous backup singers? Will the star-crossed lovers ever unite? Will Dennis save the club and discover love himself? Will Stacee Jaxx find his musical soul? The viewer will have to find out these answers (and more) themselves, but the journey is one wild ride, which comes to a most satisfying conclusion, at least in my opinion.And while the vocals by Baldwin, Jones and Brand do not always hit the right pitch, I was pleasantly surprised with the two leads. However, it's Cruise, who carries the picture, stumbling about as if in an eternal stupor off stage, but on it becomes the rock god he is worshiped as.His performance is a real revelation - and he has already been nominated for several Academy Awards. In fact, as Jaxx, he does more with a scowl, grimace or body movement than anyone else in this production does with pages of dialogue.There is also decent chemistry between the leads so, finally, there is a love story you can actually believe in. The laughs mainly come from Baldwin and Brand (and a hilarious situation they find themselves in), but Jones and Cranston earn a few snickers, as well.So, with love, lust, comedy, a little pathos and a lot of speaker-pounding, heads-shaking hard and pop rock, this film is certainly worth the time spent watching it.",Rock of Ages
73,fjhuerta-2,This is what happens when a boy buys his way towards a leading role,4,25 May 2014,"The movie.. is somewhat enjoyable. Tom Cruise really rocks, as does Paul Giamatti, Rusell Brand and Alec Baldwin. They give it their best. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows up in a role that's completely disposable - nothing she does has any relevance on the outcome of the movie, but she's OK.I don't mind the script at all, either. All I wanted was some rocking music, nice settings and funny one-liners. I was there during the 80's, so I expected the hair bands, the glam, the excess, but all in all, the fun of the whole era. It wasn't that much to ask.The big issue I had was that, while the supporting characters were awesome, the leads were incredibly dull, bland and awful. It's painfully obvious Julianne Hough has nothing to do with rock, and is more of a country singer. Her style and voice simply have nothing to do with the 80s, or rock. When she comes on screen and asks the audience if they are ready to rock, she should have been boo'ed off the stage. She was just a pretty face without any sort of voice resembling rock. We expected Joan Jett, and we got a fourth rate Dolly Parton. But I could have barely tolerated her, if not for...Yes, Diego ""Boneta"" - actually, Diego González. The only reasonhe's in the movie is, well, money. Tons of it. His father, Lauro González, used tobe a big shot on a telecommunications company called SatMex, with close ties to Televisa, the leading TV station in Mexico. His son didn't want to study and wanted to be an actor. So his dad used his money to buy call center time and got his son into something like American Idol, only kid based. The call centers called in day and night voting for Diego Gonzalez - and a ""legend"" was bought. No talent, no singing voice, no acting ability - only money, and tons of it! The kid hasn't accomplished anything in México. Funnily enough, he may only be remembered for being in a group that was a virtual clone of the ""Z-Guyeeez"", the band that was mocked during the movie.If you ever wondered why such a weak character was picked as a lead for this movie, now you know. In my opinion, Gonzalez and Hough destroyed the movie. And that is a shame, because Tom Cruise was simply amazing, and had a voice and personna that simply took over the entire film. His performance is reason enough to watch the movie!",Rock of Ages
74,Bruce722,Entertaining but a lot of cheesy parts.,6,20 January 2013,"Rock of Ages is a film about the survival of Rock & Roll and the people who live it. It's a decent movie but it starts out with a really cheesy quality that plagues most musicals and makes it difficult to get into the plot. Most of that is due to the fact that the first part of the movie is centered almost entirely around Julianne Hough. While she is absolutely gorgeous, is a fantastic dancer, and is even a decent singer, her acting ability is essentially nonexistent. However, once you get into the meat of the movie it's actually quite enjoyable. Sure, the impromptu musical numbers popping in throughout the film sometimes feel a little ridiculous but the mash-ups that are done and put together really well and progress the plot along well portraying the feelings and emotion of the moment. Also, Tom Cruise' role as Stacee Jaxx absolutely steels the show. This was honestly probably one of my favorite Cruise roles because he was pretty hilarious but also it's a character we've never really seen before, not just from him but in general. There were some surprising roles by people like Mary J. Blige, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Malin Akerman that I wasn't aware of before watching. There were also some unexpected cameos by Constantine Maroulis (former American Idol contestant and pop/rock singer), Kevin Cronin (of REO Speedwagon), and Sebastian Bach (modern metal God and former singer of Skid Row). Overall, I think rock fans will enjoy the film but I'm not sure how well most people would. Personally, I love rock and enjoyed it for the most part but there were even times, especially towards the beginning and end, where it felt like it just dragged on and on. There was even a funny part in the end where the lyrics of one of the songs covered stated how the movie goes ""on and on and on and on"" and that seemed like an accurate assessment.",Rock of Ages
75,brefane,Hough did this ever get made?,1,11 October 2012,"Not campy, not sexy, not down and dirty, no rock, no roll, no point. Bland and rhythm-less movie from director Adam Shankman, responsible for the bland, pointless remake of Hairspray, is a badly photographed episode of Glee with an unnecessary dash of kink. Can't Stop the Music, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, The Apple, Phantom of the Paradise were a lot more fun. There isn't an original idea at work anywhere in this film. It's a jukebox musical; a collection of music videos of no interest whatsoever. Tom Cruise provides little diversion while Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand and Bryan Cranston are merely odious. The two leads are as cute as they are uninteresting. Within the first few minutes you feel the movie dying; what follows is a wake.",Rock of Ages
76,kevinxirau,Cities are built on rock and roll!,8,3 December 2012,"Well, what do we have here? You know, even though I wasn't born in the 80s, I still enjoy that particular era because a lot of good things were made at that time, particularly music. Nowadays, most of today's music isn't that appealing, but this flick takes you back to that era when rock music, among other things, was at its peak. Based on the Broadway show of the same name that travels back into the 1980s, this is Rock of Ages.The plot mainly consists of a few different but intertwined story lines: A small-town girl falling in love with a city boy, a rocking owner and his partner struggling to keep their Bourbon Room nightclub open, a mayor's wife with a grudge trying to bring it down, and a moping rock star with a heart-breaking secret finding a motivation to be more lively. All the while, the story is carried on with a collection of classic rock songs that, in their own way, fit the mood of a variety of scenes in the film and I just love it! The movie is over-the-top and occasionally a little weird, but that's part of its charm and there are lots of hilarious moments a lot of it coming from Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx, who plays off as a mysterious rocker with the unstoppable power of making woman fall all over him. The rest of the cast does their job well, whether it's the sassy Catherine Zeta-Jones, the laid-back Alec Baldwin, or the cute dynamic duo of Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta. The choice of songs is awesome from ""We Built This City"" to ""Juke Box Hero"", songs I have come to love throughout my life and they mix the lyrics of these songs very well.I had a great time with this movie. It has it all: classic songs, sexy women, flashing lights, a good story, an excellent cast, and a fun mood that carries on into the night. Makes me wish I lived in the 80s era (at least for a little bit). This is a good break from the modern, CG-filled world and traveling to a simpler, more lively time period. Want a great, over-the-top film to watch with a sense of musical nostalgia, then Rock of Ages is the movie for you. Rock on, dude!",Rock of Ages
77,Scott_Mercer,The Musical is Still Dead - This movie did not bring it back,4,31 March 2013,"Norm MacDonald was in a sketch during his stint on Saturday Night Live showing his character in some kind of musical, who was a real person confused why everyone around him suddenly broke into song from time to time. Yes, Norm, exactly. People just don't DO THAT in real life, unless you've run into a flash mob or a ""mission"" by Improv Everywhere. That's the problem with the musical as a form: every time one of the characters starts singing, you are rudely reminded that what you are watching is not real but a fiction. I get that this is a stylistic choice, but if telling a story through song is what you want, like, say, opera, why not sing through 100% of the running time? Or 95%? Or 90%? Why give the characters just enough time to get back into a groove of verisimilitude, then unceremoniously yank the rug out from under the audience who are trying so hard to suspend their disbelief, by having the characters breaking into song again ten minutes later? It really doesn't help that we're using hit hard rock songs here. I'm not opposed to so-called ""jukebox musicals"" on principle, but the supposed stance of rock music was always supposed to be cool, edgy, rebellious. Those words to me in no way describe stage or film musicals in stance, assumptions or affect. Yes, something like ""Mama Mia"" worked, but that was only because Abba's music was so dorky and corny to begin with that a theatrical musical fit their style like a glove.Yes, I did get nostalgic, since I was there for part of that time, especially the scene where they went into Tower Records (SNIFF!) But in the end, that didn't help. (And yeah, you can't take a taxi to the back of the Hollywood sign...that bit was so moronic I wanted to barf.)Really, I kind of feel about musicals the way I feel about sports. I get why going to see the event live and happening right in front of your eyes at the venue has some entertainment value, but I just don't get why anyone would want to watch a pre-recorded version at home.",Rock of Ages

It might as well have been a different movie.The two leads were too corny, boring and annoying to be taking the most of the time on screen and the great Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise, amazing as ever) didn't have enough time. But every time he does show up, he steals the show and makes the weak script look a little better. I also wish Lonny (Russell Brand) and Dennis (Alec Baldwin) had more screen time, as they were my favorite characters. In the musical, Lonny serves as the narrator and gets the best lines and the funniest moments, but here, everything was completely scrapped, and frankly that's what really ruined it for me. I did like the song mash ups and Catherine Zeta Jones was also wonderful. I also enjoyed the feel and music of the 80s, but if you really want a good time, go and see the musical.",Rock of Ages

I'm not tying to ""fay shame"" him but I certainly wouldn't want to be under that hurling mass.As for the film, it's pretty decent and I personally think they managed to mix up rock songs into a Broadway type of musical nicely.Yes it has a very basic and repeated formula to the story telling and the final third of the movie felt quite weak, but it still tied off most of its lose ends nicely.Tom Cruise was an absolute standout here when it came to all-round performances, but everybody did very well in their roles.As much as I did enjoy it, I can't see myself ever watching this again, once feels like enough.Now let's all join Scientology.",Rock of Ages
80,Ric-7,Wasted (and not on drugs),4,29 June 2012,"I think the problem was the script, which was basically a rehash of plots at least as old as teen movies of the sixties: a garage band making big, for example. The misunderstanding between the leads--that's at least as old as Frankie and Annette. And the Catherine Zeta-Jones character was lifted from a John Waters movie.The music covers were adequate, but you can say the same for American Idol and similar shows. The songs were no reason for this film to be made.Tom Cruise was basically the reason to see the film, and he has a scene which would make a good music video. Otherwise, he was adequate, but it would have been so much better if there was a point to his performance, and if he could have had a director who could help him (or at least restrain him), he would have been much better.Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were interesting for a while, but were basically unused.The use of the old musical convention of having the characters singing other than in a specific musical performance (i.e., walking the streets and singing, love duets, etc.) is risky, and frequently in this film, such songs seemed awkward and self-conscious.",Rock of Ages
81,headly66,Cheese smothered in bad music covered in more cheese,1,30 September 2012,"This sad, silly attempt to bring back musicals is as lame as you could imagine. The fact that it is set in the 80's and filled with every over played hit from that era makes it even worse. I went to high school in the 80's and there was a reason we all listened (except for a few exceptions) to much older, better music. The amount of talent in this film is far outweighed by the corny ""burst into song"" cringe worthy intro into each new tune. I found myself laughing out loud. The plot is so simple and cliché it's not worth mentioning. Cruise is actually the only entertaining thing about this but that is not saying much. The 80's were not a great time and only 45 year old chicks would want to relive it channeled through Bon Jovi and Journey.",Rock of Ages
82,snowfre,A badly written movie that never let's its starry cast shine,5,3 January 2020,"Based on the Broadway show of the same name, ""Rock of Ages"" is a rock jukebox musical filled with stars such as Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Bryan Cranston, and Tom Cruise, most of which are wearing horrendous wigs. Now, I guess that's what you can expect from a glam rock infused musical but the success of the Broadway stage show is unfortunately not transferred to this feature. We get to follow Sherrie (Hough) as she moves from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Hollywood with the dreams of becoming a singer. There she meets the aspiring rock musician Drew (Boneta) and a love story begins that is bland, uninspiring, and predictable. Cruise makes the film's most memorable performance as rock legend Stace Jaxx (even though I need to admit that Hough and Boneta are Disney Channel cute sometimes) but ""Rock of Ages"" falls with its very coincidental plot. Virtually none of the decisions the characters are making have any trace of a larger impact in the storyline. While the musical numbers are fun and captivating, and Breaking Bad legend Cranston makes minor but hilarious appearances, ""Rock of Ages"" is way too long for its own good; or for the audience's good for that matter. Rock has never felt less rebellious.",Rock of Ages
83,troy-manatunga,Yet another cruise movie!,5,4 December 2012,"136 minutes seem a long run time for a musical and ROCK OF AGES could have been better provided it did limit to 90 minutes. However this is one critic's opinion and lovers of musicals may counter argue that the genre has habits of long run times owing to the rock and roll. Directed by Adam Shankman most popularly known for the magical movie A WALK TO REMEMBER over a decade ago once again may have conjured up a direction that may keep his name afloat amongst movie lovers for a few years. ROCK OF AGES is to this critic personally more appealing than Adam Shankmans' previous attempt at the genre; HAIR SPRAY. Based on the Broadway musical named under the same title, ROCK OF AGES finally was released one year later than it was formerly intended for. Paying tribute to rock bands that played on the Sunset Strip Back in the 1980s this movie carries nostalgic value to those who did experienced the Strip in all her glory. Whilst everything that this critic knows about the strip is by reading the World Wide Web, he recalls watching his old man grow older listening to these bands of the 80s that rocked the Sunset strip hence the ability find a certain inkling that chalks the movie as favorable.Enough of the trivia, but why would we enjoy ROCK OF AGES? Firstly the musical talent that is under the spot light is absolutely well scouted talent one would agree. This statement can be argued upon by many a viewer since its evident that some Hollywood royalty struggles in pitch and the vocal imperfections are not digitally hidden too well to the sound tuned ear. However Shankman and his crew seem to have ensemble a cast that does the trick in order for the production to rise close to its expectations. Secondly the best part of the movie is the movies sound stage. It's not much; however the little it is reaches out to the lovers of the 1980s rock n roll scene. Thirdly the inclusion of Tom Cruise, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti is the only reason most of the viewers sits for the movie in the first place. It indeed is partly the reason I am seated for it apart from my fondness of rock n roll music of the early eras. Stacee Jaxx who is portrayed by Tom Cruise is hands down one of the better performances of Cruise who still is to experience the honor of an Academy Award. Will this carry him all the way through to the Oscars? (A commendation probably, however a win most certainly not.) Cruise however does capture the essence of an artist who has experienced fame in all its glory and now is overwhelmed by that very fame that is forcing him into a dark corner in his career and personal life. Does he find his redemption? One must spend 136 long minutes of their lives to find that out.My personal favorite is indeed Brand and Baldwin. Although with very limited screen time this duo alone keeps the motion picture afloat. ROCK OF AGES lose its footing on numerous occasions and finds its way to the surface with the aid of this duo and obviously with the aid of the timeless rock classics by Whitesnake, Def Lepard, Van Halen, Quiet Riot and Skid Row.Finally the stars of the movie that does have professional exposure in Broadway and does have the voices for the production naturally without 4 months of vocal training (Guess who?) are near perfect in vocals. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta carry great showman ship, still starring beside the likes of Cruise, Baldwin and Brand somehow overshadow them entirely and the chemistry of love that Shankman is searching for does not seep through to the audience. It if felt as short bursts of successful singing which is later always drowned by the above mentioned stars when the take to the screen. After all the ROCK OF AGES is another Tom Cruise Fame Vehicle isn't it?

What this film really is, is an MTV ""coverband"" tribute to all the ""hair"" bands of the 80s.The storyline is pathetic, the dialog (when not sang) atrocious, and Tom Cruise's portrayal of ""Axel Rose / Steven Tyler"" is just plain sad.It's your typical small town girl (Julianne Hough / Sherrie) comes to the big city (Los Angeles / Hollywood) to seek fortune and fame, finds boy (Diego Boneta / Drew); loses boy; takes to the street of LA; becomes a dancer at a Gentlemen's Club, only to find boy again story.However, I must admit my two favorite scenes of the whole movie were the two music numbers that took place in the Gentlemen's Club!!!! Them Girls HAD TALENT!!!!! But music alone cannot a movie make!!!! So even though, I smiled, and cringed, and laughed, and sang-a-long the movie itself is garbage!!!

85,cadillac20,"Fun, throw away nostalgia that just misses the mark.",6,13 June 2012,"Some people will argue that 80's nostalgia needs to die. The music, the clothes, the entertainment, the hair. Some people just want to forget it all. I, for one, love the 80's nostalgia. I love 80's music, 80's movies, 80's cheese. It's endlessly entertaining. So, when someone took all this and wrapped it up in a musical, it was definitely something that piqued my interest. Sadly, I missed the stage production, but with the movie came a chance to see one of Broadways biggest hits in the new millennium. Sadly, it doesn't quite stand up there with the best movie musicals and the results are mixed.Certainly, this is a fun movie, if you enjoy this sort of thing. There are good musical choices here, hilarious performances, and enough cheese to make a 50 pound pizza. But the film misses in certain key areas. For one, much of the music is performed poorly. There are some surprisingly good voices here in the leads and even in Tom Cruise, but the film would have seemed to benefit from some legitimate Broadway stars, perhaps even the ones who put on the Broadway musical instead of stuffing it with big name stars. In the acting department they all do a fine job, Tom Cruise in particular, who once again seems to be having wild fun as the big rock star Staci Jaxx. His performance saves the movie from the others, which tend to remain mostly ho-hum.The biggest problem the film suffers from is the pacing. It feels rushed as we move from musical piece to musical piece. Granted, it's already a long movie at just over two hours, but the film feels so much like a musical that some of the enjoyment from the songs are is lessened. The performances are funny and kitschy enough that you can have fun, but the songs come out so erratic that you just can't have as much fun. I also have to ask Hollywood for one thing: please stop putting Catherine Zeta Jones in musicals. Her performance here is by far the worst. When she sings, you almost feel embarrassed for her. Certainly she's funny, but more so in the way you'd laugh about your mom embarrassing you in front of other people.I might be a little biased towards this film, since I tend to gravitate towards this kind of cheesy fun, but Rock of Ages sadly misses a chance to capitalize on the fun of 80's entertainment. Everything about this just falls short. I am sure the stage musical is fun and now have a greater desire to seek it out, but the movie just doesn't do it justice.

You'd have to be a pretty grumpy person not to enjoy Rock Of Ages, it's just a bunch of fun, the only thing wrong I thought was it was a tad too long and Malin Akerman's character was a little underused, but generally this is a hilarious comedy, a rocking musical and a big fun film.Love it. :)",Rock of Ages

The dull acting from the main characters blended with a total lack of display for the naive rock mentality made me say out loud: ""What in the world...!?""One good thing about the motion picture is that there is some kind of an objectivity in finding some jokes here and there. (Often, even they just fall down and leave a tired mark for the history to pick up. The humour during this kind of rock flick must have been the first thing that came to the writers mind. Do you guess that it is bad?) The songs and the rock is taken so far into the polished pop culture that I would say that they have ruined big rock giants. That is a sad fact. I myself is an rocker and loved (and still love) much of that music that ""made history stand out"".Justin Theroux, Chris D'Arienzo and Allan Loeb.

Good sound....well.... you decide. The make up is sometimes so bad that it screams for attention. Look at Paul Giamattis hair; oh, my lord! - The actors : Yes. that is the questions. Even with a solid ensemble of actors I ask myself: Adam Shankman, where did you leave them? Where are they? - Entertainment : It is entertaining to write a review to get this off my chest. - Age : 15. Can come down to 11 in some circumstances.4,5 out of 10.

90,patsworld,I Plan To See This One Again,8,25 June 2012,"What a fun film. Aside from a thin plot line..but then, don't most musicals have that?.. the film was really cool. Every example of the singing covering the hits from the '80s was credible. Okay, Steve Perry nobody was, but then.nobody is. I am totally blown away by the singing of Tom Cruise. Who knew? The older this guy gets, the more fascinating he becomes. And Diego Bonita has not only good lucks, but in addition, a really good voice. All in all, for anyone who lovedno lovesthe music of that decade, this is a grand reason to go to the movies. Some truly funny stuff in there, too. The scene (Oh, you'll know the one) between Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand was especially amusing. There really should be more musicals made. It's so refreshing not to have a choice between one horrific, realistic chop 'em, shoot 'em, or scare 'em silly movie after another, that this is exactly what we're looking for.",Rock of Ages
91,rcolgan,Just Enjoy the Music,6,7 July 2015,"What happens when you get a bunch of actors, dress them in silly costumes or wigs and get them to sing some of the best rock tracks of the 70's and 80's? You get Rock of Ages. And with it all the cheesiness and over the top nature of a jukebox film.Its story follows just about every cliché that you can think of. Our out of town girl Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) comes to Hollywood looking to become a rock-star. She meets and falls in love with Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) who has the same aspirations of rock and roll. We watch them try to get into the rock and roll scene which is going through difficult times due to fighting off a politician doing a slander campaign to boost his support and the corporations that are trying to turn rock groups into boy rapping groups.For the most part the cast seem to be up for getting into the spirit of the film and embracing their over the top characters, all of whom have their funny moments. Catherine Zeta Jones does well as the campaign woman with a stick up her rear who believes that rock and roll spawns nothing but sex, hateful music and sex. Paul Giamatti is a manager who isn't in it for the music and only wants the money, willing to back-stab anyone for an easy dollar completely embracing his character as a douche-bag. The only actor who seems out of place is Alec Baldwin who gives the impression of a guy who's already signed a contract and can't pull out now. The only thing amusing with his character was his over the top wig. But the best cast member is Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. He seemed to devote himself to Stacee as much as he would to any dramatic role playing an exaggerated Axl Rose style of rock-star. He has a big ego, but with good reason. Any time he enters a room all eyes turn to him and he seems to be able to get every woman he meets to swoon or fall under his spell at the mere sight of him. Then there's the songs themselves, which are very enjoyable. Unlike a film like Mama Mia (and its dreadful vocals from the likes of Pierce Brosnan and Meryl Streep), here the actors are great singers and do the songs justice. However once again Cruise is the standout demonstrating some real musical talent by not just acting like a rock-star, but singing like one too doing an amazing cover of Bon Jovi's 'Dead or Alive'. Whilst the songs are great, the film's weakness is the time between songs. Where we're left following what are really quite boring plot lines that we've seen before too many times like the main couple splitting because of a misunderstanding or a girl having to go to the life of a stripper because Hollywood is tough. Not only have we seen these too many times but they're done poorly here. Plus the film is too long and it would have probably helped if the film were cut by about 20 minutes since 2 hours is too long for a jukebox musical to keep audiences entertained. But as bad as the script is, the actors are entertaining and the songs are good. So long as you don't have any higher expectations then you shouldn't be let down.",Rock of Ages
92,fredberglyle,ROCK OF AGES doesn't rock at all,4,14 June 2014,"The finest rock music from 1980's were completely wasted for a terrible movie, IMO.The good thing about the movie are the songs featured in it that included Def Leppard's, Bon Jovi's, Scorpions, Journey, Starship's, Speedwagon's and of course the GnR's classic numbers from the 80s. There were few comedy lines that were okay esp. the phrase ''m gonna burn this place down... not with my music but literally', sure deserved laughs. There were some acrobats dancing in a club/bar that deserved an eye.The first issue with the movie is the PG13 rating. The movie script might have been diluted/sanitized for younger viewers. No reference to drugs are made to a movie with rock music, which is not practical. The script was cheap romantic one which is as old as sky. Tom Cruise and the lead actor male were fine among others who were totally wasted, IMO. Some dialogs are barely heard and so its annoying. The bottom line: There are good number of songs in the movie. If you are an admirer of 80s songs then watch the songs only and forward the rest.",Rock of Ages
93,bjones,Coulda been Disney,6,17 June 2012,"Considering that my youngest was a dedicated and superb guitarist at the exact time period the film was set in, and we're in California, I had more than a few expectations for this film going in. By the time the closing credits rolled by I found I was of a divided opinion; some good, some bad. The easiest first, the good:Good thing number one is Julianne Hough. The only drawback with her is that hard-core rockers will find her too bland, even later in the film when she falls off of her GTS's.Overall, I thought someone like Emmy Rossum or Anne Hathaway may have been better picks for the part, with their much fuller voices and more candid, adult sexuality.Hough's leading man is the forgettable, unknown-in-the-mainstream Diego Boneta (born Diego Andrés González Boneta in 1990 in Mexico City, Mexico). I felt inclined to dismiss him as just another pretty-boy used as Latin eye-candy to attract the younger teenaged- girl ticket buyers; ala Ricky Martin.Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alex Baldwin and Russell Brand all did yeoman service but nothing to write home about. Without doubt, the biggest surprise of the film was Tom Cruise. He managed to look younger thanks to what appeared to be maniacal workouts. But the big fat sprinkle- covered-cookie was his singing. He is credited with the vocals in the sound track credits so I have to believe it was really him singing. Thats right, he was so good I had to check. I'm already annoyed with him for getting to slowly grope both Hough and Akerman. No mortal man should ever be allowed to be that lucky.Another surprise for me was the talent of the beautiful, Swedish-born Malin Akerman, who is very watchable in this. In one sort-of love scene with Tom Cruise she is startlingly sexy set to music.Now for some of the downside. It's supposed to be a comic satire - I think. There really wasn't enough good comedy to tell, even with Cruise hamming it up all over the set. The plot, and therefore the film, revolves around a central character, a pretty, young, small town girl from middle America (played by Julianne Hough; a pretty, young, small town girl from middle America) who comes to LA to make her fortune in the music industry; again like Hough. The plot is something right out of the 30's, pulled from the shelf - dusted off - and the names and places changed to protect the innocent. I think the filmmakers didn't notice the too-old-fashioned, paper-thin story. The release info describes the film as a Comedy, Drama, Musical, Romance. They should have picked one, or at most two, and done a better job. As it was, it seemed they were going more for a comedic setting, but missed huge chances to make it a great deal funnier.The biggest down-side, for me, was the completely ill-advised decision to throttle back what could have been great by going for the kiddie ticket-buyer with a PG-13 rating! To me, the rivers of alcohol present was more off-putting than things that may have made it an R rating. One of the things Heavy Metal was about was a blatant sexuality. That's largely missing here; although Akerman came closer to it than any of the rest in her table top scene with Cruise. I'd have given my left big toe for that to have evolved into a more grown-up scene. Had Akerman peeled a bit further she'd have become a legend. As it is, it'll likely be forgotten. Come to think of it; that's a perk Cruise didn't need. The filmmakers just couldn't drop the hammer.I know, I know ... it was extracted from a Broadway musical of the same name. So ... that doesn't mean it couldn't have been greatly improved. It was like going to a highly touted action film to find the climactic scene turned out to be a pillow fight between Batman and Spiderman.As alluring as they were, due to the production decisions eliminating most of what could have been a blast, Hough and Akerman just failed to exemplify the hard-edged, blatant sexuality of the era. After all, boys grew up dreaming of being rock stars, not to play music, but to have access to bundles of not-quite-clad sexy girls. A juicier, more adult, far better script was hiding in there trying to get out, but perhaps a Rossum-like star might have been needed to bring it out in Hough's part and I'd have loved to see Hathaway in Akerman's part; not because they're inherently so much better singers or actresses but because both of those ladies know how to kick down barriers with aplomb.I tend to think either woman Hough or Akerman, may have been up to the challenge given the chance. As it was both were very chaste in the film, the costuming perhaps a shade more modest than 2010's Burlesque in which Hough also appeared with Christina Aguilera and which also missed the mark.Both this film and Burlesque suffer a crisis of credibility by completely ignoring what originally made their representative genres so popular: s-e-x and the maximum amount of s-k-i-n. There's nothing in either film that couldn't be seen on any given weekend in a Southern California mall bar the singing.Well, a guy can dream, right?",Rock of Ages

95,cattjones,Head Banging Entertainment,6,15 June 2012,"I know that you are going to find this hard to believe but I was a rock and roll fan long before I was a rhythm and blues fan. The first album that I ever bought was a Pink Floyd album. I found myself singing along with most of the songs, but this was one weird movie. Although the story line was really nothing new, I was surprised that so many actors that normally don't sing on screen had pretty decent voices. I have to say that Tom Cruise (Stacee Jaxx) looks damn good to have just turned fifty. As with all his roles he really threw himself into this character and was totally convincing as a superstar, doped up rocker of the eighties. I have to say that the headband kind of reminded me of Bret Michaels (not sure if that was intentional or not). It was discovered during the preparation of this film that Tom has a four octave range. Who knew? Is there anything this guy can't do? The relationship between Alec Baldwin (Dennis Dupree) and Russell Brand (Lonny) was unexpected (you'll see what I mean once you see the movie). I have to say that Julianne Hough (Sherrie Christian) was adorable in this film, but I think that her acting skills can use a little honing if she ever intends to do a film that doesn't involve singing or dancing. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Patricia Whitmore) was as good in this film as she was in Chicago. Playing the rock and roll hating wife of Bryan Cranston (Mike Whitmore) suited her to a tee. I have to say that she has not lost her chops. You might know director Adam Shankman from So You Think You Can Dance as a guest choreographer. I have seen movies that become Broadway plays, but I am not sure if it works so well the other way around. I can understand why this film was such a huge hit on Broadway because if nothing else, it is entertaining. However there are a couple of scenes that had me shaking my head and thinking, ""I can't believe that they just did that"". I say that if you are a true head-banger, and you want to see conventional actors rocking out, then go out and see this film. If not, wait until it comes out on DVD. I am giving this film an amber light.",Rock of Ages

The impact of that kind of performance from a box office giant that has for quite a while fallen from grace is simply no longer going to give any movie that much of a boost. Let alone a musical/comedy that is way short on laughs. The film tried so hard to stay in a PG-13 type format that at every opportunity they could of been edgy they took the mainstream safe route.

I also could do without all the Hollywood insider junk. In the end, I wound up fast-forwarding through a lot of it.I think I might have enjoyed a filming of the play itself a lot better.

98,alexcomputerkid,Rock Ages is a film that kind of makes me want to listen to 70's or alternative music,3,29 July 2013,"Being born in the 90's, you would expect me to be to listening to current music. Not really though. 80's music and 90's music a little is where it's at for me even though this is not really common for people in my age group. It is music that brought me to where I am now as a teenager and in some ways how I found my friends. That being the case, I really should have liked the 80's - themed musical Rock Of Ages. It appealed to me because of the music but there were many problems that caused me not to like it.Rock of Ages is set in Los Angles in the 1980's, Sherrie (Julianne Hough) ditches her Oklahoma hometown and family and sets off to LA for a new start. She meets the handsome Drew (Diego Boneta) and a relationship forms with both working at The Bourbon, a rocking bar where rock bands perform. Rocker, Stacee Jaxx ( Tom Cruise) is the main subject in the film and his interactions with Sherrie causes Drew to be distant with her.Actually you are not going to find a finer collection of 80's music in one piece. You get Journey, The Scorpions, Guns N' Roses and other big names from the 80's but actually this is the main problem with this film. Who really wants to watch an actor who is lip-syncing one of your favorite songs when you know the band who really plays it and you would rather watch them? Also at times the song's rhythm and message don't really fit the story. On the other hand, the atmosphere depicted is pretty wild with good lighting on the stage which makes you want to be there.After struggling with the music, the plot is not all that strong either. The story is one of a middle-age person running away where that's not really common. The supporting cast includes Russell Brand who sports a terrible wig and also Paul Giamatti who seems lost here. The lead characters are thin and about as cheesy as they come. Tom Cruise is not very likable and it is hard to follow what he wants or where he's going. There is also a rap idea that added nothing for this film. Further, the main band here is something called Wolfgang Von Colt and I can't come close to figuring what they are all about.I am also not sure why this movie was sanitized to give it a PG-13 rating. Drugs and sex were a big part of the 80's music scene and the movie needed more of this to be realistic. The ending is also a little weird with amateurish bands who seems tame and that's dates back to the PG-13 idea.In short, this movie does not really depict the 80's music scene very well. The setting of the movie is one cheap bar with nothing special to it. The filmmakers just did not show the 80's very well and many more ideas could been used to get the full 80's effect.Rock Ages is a film that kind of makes me want to listen to 70's or alternative music and makes me forget how much I was into this type of music in the first place. It was that bad for me.",Rock of Ages

Thanks Tom, take a break from being a fake miracle hero to being a fake musician in a real musical. This is an amazing play on Broadway. I can see they lost money on the movie production which would not have to be true if they used musicians to perform as they do on Broadway. The rest of the casting is good. Tom is clearly only able to ""sing"" with autotune. His voice completely changes when he sings and he is covered up by other singers. Now there is no chance for this to be done again. In another movie, Mamma Mia, the actors would sing or song or two and it was more of a fun farce. In this case, a stage play where the song are as great as they ever were uses a non-singer to sing the main role. Despite this annoying fact, the movie is fun whenever Tom is not on the screen.",Rock of Ages
100,tgooderson,About as Rock n' Roll as a jam sandwich with the crusts cut off,4,22 June 2012,"In 1987 Sherrie (Julianne Hough) sets off from her home in Oklahoma towards L.A with dreams of rock stardom. Almost as soon as she arrives she is mugged and helped by Drew (Diego Boneta) who works at the Bourbon Room, a Sunset Strip rock club. Sherrie gets a job at the club and she and Drew begin a relationship while both dreaming of becoming singers. Meanwhile the club's owner Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and his right hand man Lonny (Russell Brand) are struggling to keep the club open amid protests from the Mayor's wife Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Rock legend Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) of the band Arsenal is due to perform at the club with the hopes of beginning a solo carer, if he can get his head back in the game long enough to do so.I'd read mixed reviews before seeing this film but I'm a fan of a lot of 80s rock music, from Iron Maiden to Metallica to Blue Cheer via Motley Crue, Motorhead and Pantera. Unfortunately this is not the sort of rock music you get with Rock of Ages. Instead you end up with the likes of Bon Jovi and Journey. This is not the type of music I enjoy, especially when the lyrics are used in place of dialogue in an annoying coming of age story. This film is about as much rock n' roll as a jam sandwich with the crusts removed.The story is predictable and you can pretty much map out all the character arcs from their introduction. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character is meant to have a big twist/secret which I worked out within a few seconds of meeting her. Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx is like a composite rock singer with facets taken from the likes of Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Axl Rose and Anthony Kiedis. The worst characters though are the central characters of Sherrie and Drew, two wide eyed all American looking kids who are meant to be all about the rock and role but as Ice Cube says in 21 Jump Street look like ""some kinda' Justin Beaver, Miley Cyrus muthas"". No wonder rock died in the late 80s if this is the sort of people who inherited it. Drew plays an acoustic guitar for rock sake! Both are far too wholesome and clean cut.The singing isn't too bad considering much of the cast aren't known for it. Diego Boneta who is apparently the Mexican Justin Beibers and Julianne Hough are great singers while Catherine Zeta-Jones has shown in Chicago that she is capable of hitting a note or two. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin aren't exactly great but in no way embarrass themselves (Brosnan I'm talking to you). Malin Akerman is decent and even Paul Giamatti has a go. The biggest surprise though is Tom Cruise who as well as impersonating the look of a rock star also sounds a bit like one too. He, like Baldwin and Brand won't be winning any awards for singing but is very much listenable to. His acting performance is also quite good and I hope tongue in cheek. Pretty much all the cast seem to be having fun rather than taking themselves seriously but again Boneta and Hough seem to be playing it straight.As well as music which wasn't to my taste, the dialogue was atrocious. Once again it was mainly the dialogue between the two central characters that was the worst and this was amplified by their wooden yet over the top acting. I honestly believe that there is a decent 90 minute film in here if you remove the two central characters completely and focus the story on Stacee Jaxx's and The Bourbon Room's problems. That part of the film was at least in part enjoyable but the two leads just sucked all the energy out of the film.Other problems included Sherrie lamenting the fact that she had become a stripper despite wearing more clothes on the pole than she did out in the street and an awful sex scene between Cruise and Ackerman in which no attempt is even given to give the idea that they have taken their clothes off. I think the 12A Certificate really hampered the rock n' roll(ness) of the movie. The monkey was there for laughs but didn't provide me with any and I have no idea what the hell Russell Brand thought he was doing with that faux Brummie accent but it sounded ridiculous. Maybe in America it would sound alright but every word felt forced and wrong. His regular accent is quite rock n' roll so I don't know why he needed to bother. Something else that bugged me is the name Arsenal. The name already has obvious football connotations in this country so was a little distracting but that shouldn't be a major problem for most people.Rock of Ages should have been a fun, silly comedy musical set at an important time for rock music but it is spoiled by terrible lead characters and actors, a bland script and poor choice of music.",Rock of Ages

The music is rock from the 80's, only delivered in Pop-ified form and sung as though the audience enjoys mediocre karaoke. The weird song transitions and abrupt cut-offs don't help on the music side of the movie, either.It was a chore to sit through this entire production, and I won't be repeating the experience. I noticed that as much as this film doesn't make sense due to the content noted above, that very same content would totally make sense if the characters from South Park replace the live- action actors.

But when I started watching the movie I immediately got the impression that this is some kind of Glee smelling teen flick.

Also I was completely turned off by Julianne Hough's 'whiny' vocals, maybe she can sing but this is absolutely NOT the genre of music she should be representing.One thing I really loved by this movie was Tom Cruise and the songs he performed.

His height it annoying in this movie and I can never get away from it is TC playing a part he never melds with the movie he ruins it.

104,ladybug2535,It's a MUSICAL and musicals celebrate music,8,18 December 2013,"I really don't get the harsh criticisms of this film: A musical is a musical, and it is hardly fair to expect it to be anything else. Most musicals aren't heavy on plot--they essentially provide a loose framework and storyline to showcase the MUSIC. That doesn't work if the music sucks, but all of the songs in this film were hits! Obviously many, many people loved this music when it came out, and most of the songs hold up very well in the remakes showcased here. If you don't like this kind of music, then it's not likely you'll like the film--if you were expecting lip-synching of the original recorded versions, then you'll also be (perhaps) disappointed. All of the actors do their own vocals. I thoroughly enjoyed the songs and their remakes, as well as how they were appropriately sprinkled throughout the film to further the logically constructed (if somewhat clichéd) storyline.There's a love story. Every musical has to have at least one love story. I do agree that the chemistry between the two leads could have been stronger, but their voices were good enough, and the acting decent enough to hold the film. I ironically felt the on-screen chemistry between Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand was better--and hysterical! Katherine Zeta-Jones was her usual capable self and radiated her longing and pain effectively, while Tom Cruise (and I am not really a fan) was great as the aging egocentric Rocker. Frankly, he surprised me--both by the convincing way he played the role, and his musical ability. I have to admit that I really enjoyed his portrayal; at one point he almost brought me to tears (don't tell anyone)--though admittedly, most of his roles aren't big on ""sharing your feelings"". The supporting cast was also great--some big names there playing affectionate homage to the music they grew up with--music that influenced their own.Maybe the whole parent protest sub-plot didn't resonate with younger viewers, as they wouldn't really understand what the whole debate was about, or how it actually affected their ability to listen to the music they desired to hear. That might have diminished their enjoyment a bit. Aside from that, there simply aren't that many musicals being produced these days, and it may be that they just don't click with many in today's audiences.I get it. Most musicals can make you roll your eyes as the cast once again implausibly breaks out into song and dance (it somehow seems more acceptable on a live stage). And most of the critical reviews are actually judging the whole musical genre as opposed to this specific film--this movie follows the standard musical framework and that is exactly what most of the people are griping about. But just as Mama Mia took Abba's popular music and gave it back to us in a refreshing light-hearted and entertaining story form, so does Rock of Ages give us a new venue to enjoy and love the music we grew up with.Maybe we just need MORE musicals! ;)",Rock of Ages

I loved the way he performed classics like ""Dead and Alive"" and ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" as if he's Bon Jovi or Axl Rose. I don't think anyone can play Stacee Jaxx and capture the essence of a rock god the way Tom Cruise did and I hope he gets an Oscar for his role very soon.

And those who are ready to face the challenge are the ones who will be able to enjoy that feeling of power over millions, with some different intensities. ""Rock of Ages"" is an enjoyable comedy musical for any one who loves the genre and is willing to be entertained. With a generous cast playing the most strange characters, this movie has nothing that might win its place among the greatest. However, it is quite possible to enjoy the almost two hours, reviving music of the eighties being sung by the most unexpected actors. It is simple, pacy and sometimes funny. Not to be taken seriously, but neither to be discarded when looking for a good time. I quite enjoyed it.",Rock of Ages
108,DJKwa,Nothing' But A Good Time!,7,24 June 2012,"While perhaps overlong, the film is packed with rocking music and a game cast that keeps the energy going and you'll be hard pressed not to be swept up in it. It's loud and over the top but it embraces its absurdity that would normally have characters breaking into song at almost any moment feel unnatural to say the least. With almost non-stop music and most characters having a moment in the spotlight through a song, Rock of Ages is a perfectly entertaining movie with a performance from Tom Cruise like no other that carries most of the film's laughs.Noting the disappointing box office performance of the film, it can be credited to an unfocused marketing campaign that had trouble selling the film's admittedly flimsy and predictable story and not highlighting the main characters in the film, particularly as the film is driven by its two youngest stars. This would of given audiences something tangible to be attracted to. Instead it advertised through the cheesy line 'nothin' but a good time' packing it's advertisements with the stars and the music but never seeming like a 'must see' specifically considering the talent involved",Rock of Ages
109,John K.-2,"If you know rock, you'll love it. If not ...",6,15 June 2012,"This film lets you know in the very first minute that it's a musical, turned into a film, that shouldn't be taken too seriously. It has plenty of good one-liners, big hair and shocking outfits, and well known 80s hits. The stars play their parts to the hilt, and Tom Cruise as Axel from Guns and Roses ... whoops, I mean Stacie Jaxx from Arsenal conveys the perfect aura of a rock god - somewhere between mystical and utterly stoned.So why have I only given it 6 out of 10? Because musicals take classic hits and weave them into the story - they're sung by the actors, and the atmosphere provided by the band is replaced by a dance routine. The rock/metal numbers just didn't work for me in that format; this may well be the a musical that sells fewer copies of the sound track than the DVD. Oh, and it has Russell Brand in it ... even when he plays the same character every time, I can't take him seriously.Sounds, the heavy rock newspaper of the 80s, used to rate albums on a 5 point scale. 2 out of 5 was classed as 'for real fans only'. Rock of Ages may well become a cult film for rock fans - especially after a few drinks - but if you don't already love rock or the 80s, it my not be for you.",Rock of Ages
110,facebook-124-955845,"Hey kids, Rock and Roll....Rock on with Rock of Ages",8,13 June 2012,"The year was 1987, the cost of gas was .89 per gallon, The Cosby Show and Family Ties ruled television, and Rock'n Roll music was extremely popular. Rock of Ages appeals to the lover of late '80's Rock on so many levels. The cast and crew do a truly amazing job at bringing the '80s back to life. The hair, clothes, and even the twelve pound cell phones, complete with antennae and phone bag, were true to the era.Rock of Ages tells the story of Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough), a small town girl who hopped a midnight train going anywhere; okay, actually it was a bus on its way to LA. The movie follows Sherrie on her quest to stardom beginning with her arrival in LA, where she meets Drew Boley (Diego Boneta), an aspiring singer and bar back at a Rock' n Roll bar called the Bourbon Room. As luck would have it, the bar is in need of a waitress and Sherrie is in need of a job. The Bourbon Room, owned and operated by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) with help from business partner and friend Lonny (Russell Brand), is floundering badly. To make matters worse there is a politically motivated protest, led by Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta-Jones) being held outside the bar deeming Rock 'n Roll detrimental to society, all in an attempt to get her husband Mike (Bryan Cranston) elected Mayor of Los Angeles. In a quest to save the bar, Stacee Jax (Tom Cruise) a famous, drunken rock star managed by money hungry Paul Gill (Paul Giamatti), is booked; however, it may be a case of too little, too late. As you would expect, the music choices was sublime. Naturally, nearly every popular song from the era is included at some point in the movie. Everything from ""Every Rose Has its Thorn"" to ""Small Town Girl"" makes its way into the movie without feeling forced. It's a natural progression that makes sense, which can be difficult for this type of movie. My fiancé and I agreed that Rock of Ages did a better job of combining the songs into a story than the 2007 film, Across the Universe. Not only is the succession of songs truly wonderful, but the combination is amazing as well. Who would have thought that ""Juke Box Hero"" and ""I Love Rock and Roll"" could work in unison or that ""We built this City"" could be joined with ""We're Not Gonna Take It""? Yet somehow, those are now two of my all-time favorite mash ups; and this is coming from a girl who watches Glee, a show littered with mash ups. So, we've covered the plot and the music, but what about the acting? Well, honestly, that too was great. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are a true force to be reckoned with. The dynamic duo was the driving force of most of the comedy within the movie, although there was comedy sprinkled throughout. Russell delivered so many hilarious one liners, that I would put this movie in the category of a ""must buy"", if for no other reason than just to hear them and grasp the true hilarity. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta's characters, Sherri and Drew, play love interests in the film flawlessly. Their interactions come across as very genuine and believable. The rest of the cast worked together extremely well and it looked like they were really enjoying themselves and the roles they were playing; the set of the movie had to be a complete blast.Joining the likes of Hairspray, Mama Mia, and RENT, Rock of Ages has now been adapted from Broadway to the big screen, and it does not disappoint. The plot may come across as predictable, and in some ways it is, but the there are twists and turns to surprise you. The cast's chemistry, paired with amazing music, awesome (and at time awesomely awkward) choreography, and a storyline that seems generic at times, but is anything but, make this movie a must see. If you leave the theatre without a smile on your face, Rock songs in your head, and a sudden urge to buy Aquanet, I will truly be surprised.

111,Parks,I Want To Rock & Roll All Nite (Until 10:30) and Party Every Day (Within Reason),4,28 December 2012,"I remember Stephen King commenting rather angrily about ""Grease"". He didn't like it , he said, because it presented an antiseptic version of the 1950's. And I remember thinking he was a twit or something equally well-argued. I mean, musicals aren't SUPPOSED to be reality, right? I'm quite sure that ""Calamity Jane"" presented a sanitised version of the Old West too, and that Sister Maria was probably a total skanky ho-bag in real life. But not in musicals. This is acceptable.What is NOT acceptable is doing it to MY decade! Yes! The 1980's have been totally scrubbed up, washed down and Glee-ed in ""Rock of Ages"" a hideous PASTICHE of the BEST MUSICAL DECADE EVER. I think the problem with the film is not that they reimagine 80's rock hits - this I can live with. It's not the totally hackneyed story (the moral majority tries to shut down a Whisky-A-Go-Go type bar). It certainly isn't the supporting cast - Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, Tom Cruise and Bryan Cranston are all terrific - and Catherine Zeta-Jones totally steals the show as a Tipper Gore type politician's wife. It is NOT EVEN the fact that this film's script made me wonder what Americans would be left to actually SAY if someone stole the words, ""God"", ""Oh"" and ""My"" from them. It is the fact that the two leads are possibly the most charmless, irritating pair of non-blooming-entities I have ever seen in this or any other film. Lacking all charisma and chemistry, they make you realise just how good John Travolta and Livvy were, back in the day. This pair murder their way through rock classics and look all dewy-eyed and idiotic. I did not care for them, is what I am trying to say.This did not quite ruin ""Rock of Ages"" for me - it had some good moments - notably the ""I Want To Know What Love Is"" scene. But it came darn close. So I suggest the rock star version of SingStar if you are in the mood to indulge your 80's groove. Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to prance around the kitchen tops while strumming a colander and pretending to be Rick Springfield.",Rock of Ages
112,Remy_Azhary,Rock never dies....and it sure as hell wasn't as fun as this!,10,21 August 2012,"I would never have thought that I would enjoy musicals as much as I would when I saw ROCK OF AGES. Most musicals would just die off by its second act but this one had me not only banging my head and swinging my feet to the rhythms but also had me sing along to the lyrics on screen right from the start to finish.Somehow watching ROCK OF AGES is like watching a big production of karaoke on big screen; and that is not entirely a bad thing. Perhaps, let me rephrase that...it's like watching a huge production of rock concert playing all the classic rock songs of the 80's (ahem, my era).The reason why I'd make the simile of this film to a karaoke is that they actually had lyrics put on screen each time a character sang. As a child of the 80's, I found myself revisiting familiar rock tunes of the 80's. From Bon Jovi to Pat Benatar; from Journey to Starship.Being a musical as it is, there's definitely going to be scenes of duets, trios and groups singing. But I'd say that the transpositions from one actor/singer to the next were flawless, all singing to the tune of a piece of song sometimes even blending 2 or 3 songs into a single scenes. Director, Adam Shankman, is indeed a master at this craft. His 2007 version of HAIRSPRAY sure gave him a solid stepping stone in film versions of musicals. I was not even aware that ROCK OF AGES was a Broadway musical in the first place, much less anticipate its film version. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it thoroughly.As for the actors, they could have easily be forgiven if anyone would consider about criticizing their individual abilities to sing. When I first learned about this film I didn't necessarily vouch for Tom Cruise as a singer at all but his 'Axel Rose' vibes certainly add to his on screen image as the Rock God, Stacie Jaxx. I'd say that parts of the singing roles were quite distributed fairly among all the main characters though sadly Mary J. Blige only appeared slightly more than the second part of the movie. As for Catherine Zeta-Jones' role of the conformist wife of the Mayor of California, her role might seemed a little forced perhaps she tried too hard to recover her Oscar-winning musical performance in the 2002 CHICAGO.But I think the most standout performance of all would have to be Diego Boneta as the upcoming rock star, Drew. His chemistry with his on screen love interest, Sherrie (played by Julianne Hough), was the most striking of all.Ultimately, this one is indeed a film to end all musicals of all ages as I absolutely love this flick and wouldn't mind seeing it again. Trust me, if you love rock music you'll definitely love this one. I highly recommend this film to everyone and would definitely encourage you to bring your friends along. You'll be singing along.",Rock of Ages
113,ladymoonpictures,It's Fun. It's a Musical. It's Rock & Roll!,7,17 June 2012,"Consider the musical ""Across the Universe"" and how Beatles songs and lyrics were used to build a premise embedded in a love story. ""Rock of Ages"" takes a similar story line and take some of our most enduring rock songs from the age of vintage rock & roll; rock anthems we know and love to tell us a fun for all frolic of a by gone era. Some of the songs that I didn't really like -- most I did mind you -- add to the story being told and suddenly didn't seem as distasteful as they were when I actually heard them on the radio. Indeed, for the first time, some of the lyrics actually seemed to make sense. I liked it. Cruise takes a dare and succeeds! He could've decided the part was beneath him, after remaking his brand in the last 'MI'. While Julia Hough needs to work on line delivery, the rest of the cast successfully just 'roll with it'. It's predictable and that's okay because it was never meant to be anything more than it is. Just enjoy - don't think. 'Ages' is a fun salute of our rock experiences with some of our trademark rock and roll songs that shaped our upbringing and lives. 'Ages' will settle in over time as a music testament of our coming of age past, our soul and salute to our rocking past. Go see it! Sit back and enjoy!",Rock of Ages

115,italo505,Worst Musical Ever?,1,31 March 2013,"What happens when you gather all the great songs from the 80's and plaster them into a musical that aims to show a raw look at rock and roll in all it's facading glory? Sounds like a great premise for Rock of Ages, right? I thought the same thing, too. As I watched the same trailers that everyone else did and heard those great songs from Journey, Pat Benatar, Twister Sister, Joan Jett and every head banging rock band that I grew up listening to and still enjoy till this day, I thought to myself: why didn't they think of this before? Unfortunately, at the end of the credits I also thought to myself: how could anybody mess it up this much? I must give Tom Cruise props. I mean for a man his age (he's 50 in case you were wondering) he's never looked better. You can see how much he prepared physically for his role as Stacee Jaxx, a rock legend who returns to the Bourbon Room to honor everybody with his presence 'cause he is a God. Or is it just God? Meanwhile, we must endure watching Sherrie Sister (the lovely Dancing With The Star's pro Julianne Hough) getting all gooey eyed with Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) who works as a bartender at the Bourbon Room which is conveniently located in the heart of Hollywood, I imagine it was inspired after the Viper Room, perhaps? Alec Baldwin is Dennis Dupree, the owner of the club who is assisted by a bozo named Lonny played the God-he's-so-annoying' Russell Brand who keeps getting job in Tinseltown, which is beyond me for he lacks talent, charisma, looks and everything else. Who hires this clown? Did I mention I hate every scene he's in along with Alec Baldwin? There's one scene in particular where they both realize that they're in love with each other and they hold in each other's arms in the most puke inducing kiss I've ever seen on screen. It's just awful. And I haven't even began to talk about Catherine Zeta-Jones turn as mayor's wife Patricia Whitmore who rallies up in front of the Bourbon Room to boycott Stacee Jaxx performance as she's so Christian and rock and roll is such an abomination. Another predictable, senseless plot that brings nothing new to the film. To be fair, I thought that Tom Cruise did the best he could with the role. He is as bit vain and clueless as his character but, when he's on stage and the lights and music turn on, he really puts a rocking great performance. I just wouldn't pay money to see this movie in the theatre and now I am glad I didn't fork $100 or more into seeing this piece of crap on Broadway. I'm placing my bet on Kinky Boots, thank you very much.",Rock of Ages
116,oldman007,Honestly...Tom Cruise and Catherine Zeta Jones are the best singers. The rest are terrible.,4,3 October 2012,"As soon as this movie starts we are thrown immediately into a Glee meets Rock song! It was interesting the way it started, but as within the next 10 mins it got ridiculous. Okay, for example, the girl (Julianne Hough) got her bag robbed by a thief and the so called, young boy hero ( Diego Boneta) comes to the rescue and let's the guy just get away and says ""Man, this must suck for you."" Ridiculous things like that happen through out the whole movie.And seriously, both the main stars Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta are just plan annoying. Their singing is atrocious and just downright terrible.Catherine Zeta Jones was great, but still quite decent She has done much better roles. And the whole movie is just so stupid and so far fetched that it's not even funny. I know it's a musical, but still.Tom Cruise saved this movie. Why he chose to surround himself with talentless singers and actors is totally beyond me! Maybe that's his way of being the star...not sure. Alec Baldwin was great as well. He sung ""I love Rock N Roll"" extremely well. Most of the humor comes from Russel Brand, so he was clearly there for the Comedy, but he does sung, but in a comedic way.So, I say see this movie just for Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin. Tom Cruise proves he can do anything. He can act, climb mountains, do stunts, ride motorbikes, dance and even sing. Both him and Alec Bladwin need to do more musicals, because they both have incredible, amazing, singing voices! I gave this movie a 4/10.",Rock of Ages
117,colm-hearne365,"Not a good movie, but great music!",6,14 December 2012,"I don't really watch musicals but I'm a big rock fan so I decided to go see it. And when I saw it, I wasn't mad on the movie, but I loved the music. The covers they did of rock bands of the 80s like Twisted Sister, Journey, Def Leppard, Guns N'Roses, and Whitesnake were amazing. I particularly enjoyed Tom Cruise's (who acted as Stacee Jaxx) cover of Bon Jovi's Wanted Dead or Alive. In fact, it sounded even better than Bon Jovi's version. I mean like most musicals, the movie is cheesy and predictable and the characters are silly, and at times annoying. But I enjoyed the chemistry between Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta as Sherrie and Drew and they made a nice on-screen couple and that's another thing that makes the movie good. But I don't think I'd watch this again because it was too campy and too awkward for me. But I'd probably only watch it just for the music anyway.",Rock of Ages
118,michaelmouse1,Trash,1,7 May 2016,"Just how bad can a screen adaption of a stage musical be? Judging by this mess, pretty bloody bad! Let's start with the casting. Abysmal. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand as Gay lovers? Seriously? What an insult to Gays. Tom Cruise as a Rock King? Beam me up to Scientology level Galactia Stupidia. It takes quite a special talent to completely bring a movie down but he manages it here. His singing was passable, if you're expecting a high school production of The Sound of Music, but he's no Captain Von Trapp, let alone Freddie Mercury. He does flash his tits a lot here though if you want to know what his tits look like, this movie is so execrable, so awful, so truly, truly bad I can't even find words...the stage production was admittedly silly but it was engaging and fun. This overblown mess is neither. If you can last till the end you're either a masochist or are fiddling on your iPad. Just wrong. On every level.",Rock of Ages

120,Braindead09,A musical for the celluloid theater,8,13 June 2012,"The film like Hairspray opens with the lead actress making her entrance via a vehicle, a bus this time instead of a dustbin van. This scene reminded me of a recent episode of 30 Rock where an innocence arrived in the big city singing her introduction but instead of wanting to be a singer she was going to be a prostitute.This film is set around the ins and outs of a Los Angeles club owned by Alec Baldwin and co-managed by his very loyal and loving assistant Russell Brand (he sports a brum accent that wavers throughout) character and the basic plot revolves around Stacee Jax final appearance with his band Arsenal and Catherine Zeta Jones crusade to close the club.The plot is not the strongest aspect of the film and some of the songs are crudely mashed together. The cast keep the story moving along and even survives a badly shot/edited musical number sung and danced by Z. Jones. Bryan Cranston steals her thunder playing her constantly horny, spank loving husband.The two leads carry their performances in their on/off/on relationship very well, but are easily overshadowed by Tom Cruise and Malin AkermanTom Cruise proves yet again when he doesn't dominate a movie, he is capable of giving an exceptional performance.The film overall though is a serious of double acts in scenes rather than a great assemble project. If it isn't Diego Boneta with Julianne Hough, its Diego with Paul Giamatti, if it isn't Giamatti with Tom Cruise, its Cruise with Akerman or Hey Man, its Hough with Blige, Baldwin with Brand etc. Blige is the only outside character. Characters get together by the films end and learn vital lessons about love and life.There are a couple of contenders for the MTV Film Award for best screen kiss, I would not be surprised to see Alec Baldwin getting nominated with his on screen kiss.If anybody has seen the episode of Glee that features a certain Journey song, it is not hard to see where the idea sprang from.I recommend everybody gives this film a go its never boring and its funny",Rock of Ages

I saw the extended version of it and had a very entertaining night full of laughter!Ok, so, the main thread of the plot is a very cheesy romance between two characters played by mediocre actors (hot actress though :P). Yet, thankfully, it didn't bother me, 'cause the characters are likeable and somehow it feels as if that plot is in the background. Then, Tom Cruise appears and has quite many scenes throughout the film and he is HILARIOUS! I've never seen him done anything like that in the past and it's so cool and fun, that he chose such a role! (Watch the extended cut, 'cause otherwise some of his hilarious scenes are missing.)I should also say, that Russel Brand & Alec Baldwin are great and very funny too!

122,dario_malic,Rock of Ages,3,3 July 2012,"Let's be clear, this movie was never to be a masterpiece. Nevertheless, it should have been much, much better. Filled with (mostly) corny old songs, clichéd characters and familiar Hollywood names, altogether involved in a silly first chances/last chances story seen hundreds of times before, Rock of Ages"" had the potential to be fun. Unfortunately, it isn't.Young girl named Sherrie comes to the big city in search of love and fame, and you can see where that will go from the first number already. With the whole bus singing and the little girl in the end of song everything crumbled before it even had a chance to soar. Although the singing isn't all that bad, great music number is a rarity in this movie. Worthy of mention is just a sequence near the end of the movie where two crowds battle each other. Rockers led by Russell Brand's character and Christian moms led by Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. And the director managed to ruin that one too, focusing on an irrelevant reporter running between them. We could also mention famous Bon Jovi number Wanted Dead or Alive"", but that's just because of a pretty good Tom Cruise's cool guy performance. Cruise is the brightest point of the movie. Malin Akerman, Paul Giamatti, Russell Brand and Bryan Cranston are worthy of mention too. And Alec Baldwin is likable, until he sings. Rest of the cast are bad, or I just can't shook off their impossibly stupid character arcs. Take for example Patricia Whitmore, Zeta-Jones' character. I would really like to know how many people didn't guess what's her story right in the beginning. My guess is maybe one in a hundred.I really don't want to waste my time writing about this movie in detail. It should be noted that the songs were mostly ruined by completely unnecessary mixing them with each other, Mary J. Blige was redundant, and the movie contains the dumbest gay scene I've ever seen.

123,ArtandJoyofMovies,A fun Friday nite date movie.,7,27 June 2012,"Not at all what I expected. A bit corny (most musicals are at times) and oddly constructed, it was still a fairly good time. I would have preferred more rock and roll, more Cruise and less goofball girl from Oklahoma trying to make it in LA. The Cruise critics are all off base though. Cruise was superb and his singing was pretty impressive.This film will be better on stage than the movie was. Musicals always are. I give the writers and director great kudos for trying to do something a bit different. But different does not always make for greatness. This film, unless adapted for the stage, will soon be forgotten. The storyline itself was older than the hills. Young hot girl from Midwest takes bus to LA to become a singer, waits tables and gets her heart broken. The side story of the Bourbon Ballroom (where most of movie is set) run by burn out Alec Baldwin and his ""buddy"" Russell Brand was amusing but more of a Saturday nite live skit. Paul Gimatti lent an aura of legitimate drama and skilled acting as rock legend, Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) manager. The whole character of Cruise was sort of a fun cross breeding of Elvis, Alice Cooper and Ted Nugent. Oh if there is a rock and roll heaven someday! Novelty lookout: Look for the very brief cameo of REO Speedwagon's lead singer, Kevin Cronin in the fan rope line near the end of the film!This is a fun Friday nite date movie, but certainly no Oscar.",Rock of Ages

125,Toocooltoobefooled,Not what I expected,6,14 October 2012,"Rock of ages is a parody of musicals. I didn't know what Rock of Ages was. When I started to watch this movie I thought it was some type of movie about the rock industry or a rock star. I had no idea it was a musical. As I watch it, I was thinking WTF. When it got to the church scene with Catherine Zeta Jones I thought this is ridiculous and horrible., I can't believe Catherine Zeta Jones made this movie and did this scene, then as the movie progressed I came to realize it's a parody. When you view it from that perspective it's not half bad. The movie is very predictable and the story line itself is not all that original. The songs chosen are great older tunes from the 80's, but some of them are ridiculously sappy choices for the scenes they are used for and that's the point. The actors sing each of the songs themselves and are quite good singers. They are clearly not professional singers and hearing them sing these classic songs they sound week and watered down compared to the original artists, but it's surprising how well they can carry a tune. I don't think they'd be hits if they had been sung by these actors, but you never really know since the music industry forces sounds on us anyway until we get used to and like the sound they shovel us. However you can see the contrast in voices when Marry J. Blye sings. Either way the actors do a nice job of carrying the tunes and the effect only enhances the parody. Tom Cruise in his usual self throws everything into the role. Like him or not, he doesn't just show up to his roles, he puts his whole heart and soul into it and plays this role very well. He also can carry a tune. Not a strong rocker voice, but does enough to make the role believable. You have to be in the mood for a musical, but keeping that in mind I'd recommend this as a rental.",Rock of Ages
126,cathie454,Very surprised by this movie,7,23 June 2012,"First of all, I did not want to see this movie. The trailers just looked stupid, and it's about the 80's which had the worst music, worst hair and worst clothes in the last half of the 20th century (more on that later.) A friend, though, had free passes and she didn't want to go alone, so I went with her expecting at best to be bored. I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, the music: there actually were a few good songs in the 80's and this movie had every one of them, making me want the soundtrack to the movie. Second, it had just the right amount of comedy and made fun of the right things of that era. The main two characters, Sherry and Drew, were great; I had fully expected that Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were going to overpower the movie, but that didn't happen. The story was predictable, but that was OK in this musical; I'm not crazy about musicals because it annoys me in most musicals when suddenly people burst into song (Wizard of Oz and Chicago being the exceptions to that rule) but the singing didn't bother me at all in this, and the songs were perfect for the situations. And, at the end, I realized something from this movie: that 80's music is not the worst music in history-- that would be boy bands and rap which was pointed out with great effect in the ending. I'm glad I saw this; it's an enjoyable, fun summer movie. Who would have ever thought that Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand make a cute couple?",Rock of Ages
127,ociopia,Awful movie but Cruise is actually fabulous and worth a look.,4,17 June 2012,"I love musicals. Truly, I just adore them. But this was actually so trite, predictable, nothing original whatsoever, including the music. About 20 minutes into it I was ready to leave. Swear. Just going to book.But, wait a minute, didn't I want to see if Tom Cruise could pull off being a combo of Bret Michaels and Axl Rose (at least that's how Poison's lead singer described Cruise.) So I sat still, okay maybe I squirmed, and waited.And I was amazed. If you saw Collateral and were mesmerized by the absolutely intensity of purpose that Cruise put into the professional hit man character, you will get to see that same intensity transformed into his cunning take on the ""every rock-n-roller over-the-hill"" idol.He saves the movie because he manages to create one character that we actually have some empathy for, a wasted rockaholic swallowed by his persona and lost into the caricature of the rock god. I actually gave some ""head time"" to his character, thinking how pathetic and hard the life is, thinking about Axl Rose and Curt Cobain, just kinda meditating on all the lost souls of extraordinary talent and crushing fame. He could have been funny but I found his character so universal and sad. Funny it was not. Not even with the baboon. Just more ridiculous head- tripped detachment sadness.His voice is fabulous. I actually thought, ""just what can't Cruise do?"" And I am one of those typical people who love to hate Tom Cruise. I always say I can't stand him and every movie I see him in, he just knocks me out. He is always great. Think of Tropic Thunder, I didn't even know it was him, swear to God, until someone 2/3rds through when I recognized his voice!So, it is an awful movie. But Cruise's performance is worth the ticket.And what is up with Journey? They must be on the everlasting high from Glee to Rock of Ages - everyone is singing ""just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit, he took the midnight train going anywhere."" Great song but what is the deal? Is it the song to personify today or something?",Rock of Ages
128,Hunt2546,not bad enough to be good,6,26 June 2012,"""Rock of Ages"" will become one of those lonely-guy deals for late nights with vodka and memories. Meant to be an anthem to the bad old days, its thinness of conceit and its shallowness of performance keep it weightless and it really needed to go into R territory to make its points. The two kids up front are lightweights--Diego and what's her name, oh yeah, Juliane Hough--about whom you don't care because they are so shallow and pretty in a TV commercial way. They look like the third and fourth places winners of the 2006 ""American Idol"" cycle. Their little shenanigan of a plot--he thinks, but no, she didn't, thus they separate and go sleazy but when they discover each other again and are redeemed by love for each other and for true rock--is completely mechanical and really gets in the way. Their instantly forgettable faces and unimpressive talent range really underwhelm the movie. Only guilty pleasures remain: Cruise is surprisingly good as the debauched 80s rocker Tracee Jax who's had all the sex the rest of us never got, and looks good belting out the songs. Mary J. Blige knocks the movie apart in her brief role as a strip club proprietoress with a heart of gold and Catherine Zeta-Jones does a hot MILF routine as a reformer with a heart of molten lust (she has the best legs in the pix, as well!) Then there's someone named Malik Akermann, ""Swedish-Canadian"" (!) who plays a reporter who jaxx, whax and roxx Stacee's soxx off. Don't know her, but in boyttalk, she's extremely sensual in a sensually extreme way. I see this one as a fast-forward tour de force, where you jetspeed through the crap to get to the five or six good numbers well performed.",Rock of Ages
129,random4ever,pure cheese,5,1 October 2012,"as a movie this thing blows, the only humor is from all the cheese, its basically a hour plus long film with tons of talented people singing cover songs of the 80-90's bad part is, they can't sing.the only good thing i can say about the film is, at least the musical instruments of the era is correct. Charvels, Jacksons, even the old Yamaha dx7 was shown on stage. tho one charvel is a later model that didn't exist then but who cares.back to the movie, it has a plot, it has what they call drama and it has tons of cheesy screens that are funny. i got no idea how they got Tom Cruise & Zeta-Jones to do this. the other cast members must be desperate and wanted the pay check regardless of how this film may end their careers.its funny at times but it gets old fast. you been warned",Rock of Ages
130,TinyDanseur27,Super fun with surprising performances by the stars of the film!,7,24 June 2013,"Other than knowing that Rock of Ages was a musical (currently on Broadway) and that Tom Cruise was in it, I really was clueless. I'm usually game for musicals though so I figured I would probably like it. Well, that would be an understatement! It was so fun! Despite some cheesy lines and simplistic plot lines, I loved it! The 80s songs were very catchy and hilariously arranged. The all-star cast which included Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, and Mary J. Blige, delivered surprising performances in musical roles (well, except Catherine Zeta-Jones; we all know she's awesome). It was funny and lively. I even didn't mind that much that Alec Baldwin couldn't really sing. It worked for his character.There wasn't much I didn't like about Rock of Ages. All I can think of to say is positive stuff. I was literally laughing out loud throughout the entire movie. Up and comers Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta were cute and quite talented. Hough had a rather pop-y voice in my opinion but somehow it worked for the movie. She worked the 80s fluffy hairstyles. Tom Cruise surprised me. I was wondering how he would pull off the role of washed-up rocker Stacee Jaxx. I've never taken Cruise for the rocker type. He proved his versatility though. He was funny and weird and actually a pretty good singer (assuming he did his own singing). I think this was a good movie for him. Catherine Zeta-Jones proved that even in her 40s, she's still got it. She sings and dances with a fierceness that could only come from years on Broadway. She's awesome.I didn't used to like 80s music. It's grown on me though. So much so, that now I have half a mind to go see Rock of Ages again. It was pretty awesome.",Rock of Ages
131,khfan250,Destined for Greatness...as a Cult Classic.,6,21 June 2012,"There's really only one way to talk about this movie, and that's in two different ways. First, I'm going to talk about it as a movie; how it does in terms of pacing, script, and plot. And in that aspect, it fails. Miserably. This story has been done so many times; a revolution of hip, cool teens versus the political punks who try to bring them down. And it doesn't really help that the main characters are uninteresting. Sherrie (Julianne Hough) goes to L.A. in hopes of becoming a famous singer. She meets Drew (Diego Boneta) and, like in the Disney movies, they hit it off right away and, a few minutes later, they're in love. And you know the drill from here: they profess their love for one another but, in a really forced manner, there's a misunderstanding between the two that forces them to go there separate ways. After they both realize that they're not complete without each other, they make their comeback in a huge, over-the-top dance number.Fortunately, the movie doesn't entirely focus on the two of them, which leads me to shift gears a little bit and talk about this movie in terms of entertainment value. Tom Cruise plays Stacee Jax, a love-making, Satan-worshiping drunk who just happens to be the biggest rock star of all time. Cruise masterfully steals every scene he's in, which isn't hard because, as I said before, our leads suck. And speaking of scene-stealers, the supporting cast is really fun, too. A gay club owner, Dennis (Alec Baldwin), and his right-hand man/partner, Lonny (Russell Brand), have the best lines in the movie, while Paul Giamatti plays his typical, sleazy douche.The songs are all 80's classics, and I promise that you will be tapping your feet to the beat and fighting the urge not to sing along with the well mixed voices of the talented cast. Final verdict: Since I wrote this review analyzing the film as two separate things, I think that it's fair to give it two separate ratings. In terms of filmmaking, it's a 3/10. It's too choppy, too predictable, and too contrived. However, in terms of how much I enjoyed myself, I award the movie a 9/10. This movie is a good time and, much like ""Labyrinth"", is an even better time if you can shut off your brain and enjoy yourself. Factoring all of that in, I award ""Rock of Ages"" a solid 6/10.",Rock of Ages
132,mrocco-1,What a great romp back to my 'young' adulthood!,10,19 January 2013,"Wow. I read some of the reviews here and find some of them absolutely ludicrous. People, this is not a movie whose purpose is to push you to ponder the meaning of life. It's like eating junk food.pure unadulterated fun! Rock of Ages hits perfectly what this movie is supposed to bea fun musical romp into an era of time with a little cheese thrown in and fantastic actors to back it up. For me it was perfection. If you're of a certain age, Rock of Ages is a trip down a musical memory lane, but with better eye candy than how I remember it.I grew up 60's/70's but was a young adult in the 80's. I always say I hate 80's music but this movie reminded me that I don't. In fact some of the songs put a visual context that made me feel much more nostalgic for those days of the big hair bands. I think 1987 was exactly the point in time I was following my 'wannabe rock god' boyfriend and hanging out at those clubs on the sunset strip. It made me remember a slice of my life that isn't quite the same in today's world. Do people still rock out or get discovered at clubs like the Roxy, the Whiskey, Gazzari's, club Lingerie, the Central? Is 'Pay to Play' still going on? Maybe it's exactly the same and I'm just old now.Regardless, this movie brought that period of time back to me, but it looked prettier here than how I remember it and provided a much happier ending. I LOVED IT.If you're looking for a movie to have some fun with, this is a gem. Don't over think it.",Rock of Ages
133,mkelly54,It's art people. Relax and enjoy the show!,8,21 June 2012,"My father had a great line: people are crazier than anybody. And that's how I feel about the negative comments for Rock of Ages. First, this is a musical farce. Nothing should be taken seriously and character development is used to enhance the genre.Second, there are numerous artists I may not like personally but I enjoy their work. Through the years various artists have held political, religious and personal views I don't agree with. No one is perfect and no one is going to agree with everything a person say or does. Yes, it's your right to protest if you like ... though think of the enjoyment you'll miss by maintaining your anger.That being said, the work Tom Cruise produced is one of his best. Much like his Tropic Thunder role, Cruise worked with the director to create an over the top character and he hit a grand slam. The same goes for Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Russell Brand. They were all hired to perform specific roles and their work fit in with the story's style.Lastly, in the late 60s the musical Jesus Christ Superstar was released. Conservative Christian protested every aspect of the show, many without ever seeing it. Today, JCSS is in constant production by those same churches that led the protests back in the day. Just as it was originally intended, the churches use it to connect with younger audiences and the modern world.This is art people. Relax and enjoy the show!",Rock of Ages

136,joshtill-98100,I Wanna Rock!,7,10 September 2020,"This film truly surprised me. Going in I heard nothing but mixed reviews, some loving the atmosphere the film brings, others berating it for being melodramatic. Rock of Ages is nothing short of a good time where you get to be reminded of some sweet tunes that you havent heard in a while. The show of Rock of Ages, going in one must understand that they are not going in to see a tear-jerking story with really powerful ballads and song selections. They are going to have a good time, while rocking out to some classic rock. This film is no different. The cast is star studded and yet no one seems to stand out. While some of the casting is questionable, that does impact that this movie is just one of those fun movies. So yes, we're all tired of the hits like Don't Stop Believing and Hit Me With Your Best Shot, but we can acknowledge that they were nothing but a good time.The story is quite shallow but once again, the movie is not for the plot. Its a cheesy rom-com surrounded by a strong supporting cast: Russel Brand, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J Blige, and none other than Tom Cruise to play the legendary rockstar Stacee Jaxx. Each character gets their own moment to shine with a song (and maybe dance) number that may not even corellate to the plot at all (an example being an impromptu innuendo scene between Jaxx and a Reporter, where they sing ""I Wanna Know What Love Is"", Doing nothing to the plot but yet being so fun in the moment).The song selection of Rock of Ages is great. As stated before, Classic Rock of the late 80's is sorely overlooked by Journey, most known for probably the biggest song ever, Don't Stop Believing. While that song is great and featured in the film, the movie doesn't shy away from reminding you of those not as big or memorable songs like We Built This City or Shadows of the Night, both great songs but overlooked by bigger names of that era. So I'd highly recommend Rock of Ages if you can handle the odd break into song and dance, and if you want a good time to rock out to some classic songs that will be stuck in your head for days after.Rock of Ages would get higher, but its plot and acting choices hold it back, so it will finish with a 7.4.",Rock of Ages
137,steel_indigo,"Fun, rock music and an interesting cast",8,26 March 2013,"The term ""rock and roll"" now has at least two different meanings, both in common usage: referring to the first wave of music that originated in the mid-1950s and later developed ""into the more encompassing international style known as ""rock music,"" and as a term simply synonymous with rock music in the broad sense.The music of the stage musical Rock of Ages is basically classic rock hits from the 1980s, especially from the famous glamor metal bands of the decade. The musical features songs from Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Pat Benatar, Twisted Sister, Steve Perry, Poison and Europe, among other well-known rock bands. This was translated into the movie.It doesn't matter if Tom Cruise had a range, most singers of the time did not. He did well on all the songs he sangnailed them. It was amazing for an actor who hasn't attempted singing prior. Benito and Hough are known. He is a famous Mexican singer and has been on US TV in shows like 90210 and Hough is a country singer who is very successful. Most would not know the cast of the stage musical at all. They are not known on TV or played on the radio. You have to be someone that attends Broadway shows or shows of that type to know most of these artists. So in certain ways knowing of Benito and Hough is not that important.I think they hired Hough because they thought they might capture a certain audience and her singing is excellent but in this case I think they would have done better if they had picked someone with an edgier voice. I thought her voice was too mild for the music although she did a great job all the same. Benito is an excellent singer but to carry the movie, they needed someone better known unfortunately. I thought he was great but had to look him up and I must say I was impressed with his credentials but he has the type of voice you find in boy bands and again I think they needed an edgier, bigger voice.All in all it reminded me of movies like Across the Universe and I thought they did a great job and people who downgrade it simply don't understand this type of movie. This movie is superior to Les Miserables in the singing ability of the cast but because of the type of movie it was didn't get the recognition that the other musical did even though the majority of those who were chosen to sing were horrendous in comparison and one in particular that I will not single out here. Rock n Roll is a catch all now for many types of rock music. Most of the bands most are thinking of are hard rock or heavy metal bands and this movie wasn't about that. I loved all the music and thought it was very entertaining, but nothing to win an Oscar. Still it was not as bad as some are stating in the reviews. I give kudos to Tom Cruise for being gutsy enough to try out singing. He did a great job. The only thing that I feel might have made it better is to choose someone else besides Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand. They weren't awful but they didn't add to the movie at all. Mary J. Blige showed just how well she sings in this movie. It was a pleasant surprise.The song ""High Enough"" was from 1990 and was #2 on the US Billboard Mainstream rock charts. It seems most songs ranged from mid 1980s to early 1990s in this show. Loved it all and if you went to concerts then and you were an adult I don't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy this movie. It's a cute farce.",Rock of Ages

Truly the soundtrack is a mustbuy...great collection of rock anthems.But while watching i couldn't shake the feeling that I might as well watch Glee...just with an older cast and a bigger screen. I have to be honest i don't really know the lyrics to well of these songs...so i don't know if like glee they are simply singing the original songs or they have adjusted the lyrics like with Mamma Mia. Using famous music and fitting a lyric that works with the movie.

139,devileye03,Tom Cruise is a rock-star for sure!,7,29 November 2012,"Rock of Ages would have been just another run of the mill rock musical, if it wasn't for Tom Cruise. Cruise plays the erratic rocker with immaculate precision. He also gets the body language, attitude and singing (he does sing a bit) right. His cockiness, conversation with Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti and pet monkey 'hey man' is simply hilarious. Known for his chocolate boy good looks, Cruise does shock you with his bad boy portrayal. Even his Kohl-ed eyes manage to arrest your attention. Cruise is awesome singing on stage my favorite Def Leppard song, 'Pour some sugar on me'. Also he was at his best while singing Bon Jovi's 'Dead or ALive'. Go and watch this movie ONLY if you like rock music of 80's (I do!) of The Poison, Twisted Sister, Journey, Styx. And for the metamorphosis of Tom Cruise into Stacee Jaxx. At age 49, he still has the charm to seduce women. Time for me to get the soundtrack of this movie. \m/",Rock of Ages

It was a superficial cream-puff written to appeal to romantic young girls and boys dreams of becoming rich and famous.I'll say one thing, aside from the cut-and-pasted plot, held loosely together by an uninteresting story, they sure save a ton of electricity as it was filmed outside at night or in a dark bar at night.Tom Cruise character I won't even bother to comment on, but Baldwin and the other guy kissing? I could almost hear their 9 o'clock shadows sand-papering. Why oh why do we have to be subjected to this gross out?The story-line was generic, and except for Baldwin, the acting was in no way spectacular. But, of course, if you just want to watch a cute boy and girl sing, then this is the film for you.It's obviously not my thing, but I was shocked to notice this film is classified okay for 6 year old children.

The story line wasn't the best and rather cheesy at parts but it's a musical and in those performances it excelled. I also thought that it was a very good looking movie and that nearly everyone's hair, makeup and clothing looked brilliant. The girls looked gorgeous. I wasn't so keen on Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin in this movie, i can't fault their singing but i didn't find their performances believable. I was distracted by Russell's terrible Scouse accent, Alec's terrible hair piece and a very strange romantic sub plot which came out of no where...

It wasn't even funny, the ones who couldn't sing we're clearly trying to sing and didn't really realise that they couldn't. For example, Russell Brand awful bad singer not funny, Catherine Zeta-Jones decent singer but tried too hard. The plot is completely different than what it was on stage and not in a good way. Some characters were missing completely and the story of Drew and Sherrie was completely different. The music was the only good thing in this movie. I adore 80s rock music but the way the cast sang it, made it sound like a modern pop song because none of them had rock voices.To sum up don't buy the film, save your money and go and see it on stage.

Though it is not one of the best musical dramas but if you are bored of watching those typical action-thriller or other types, then do sit down for watching this movie.Songs in this movie are good enough to make you chill, in fact I've dowmloaded some of those.Story is basically based on a boy and a girl who came from different cities to hollywood in search of fame. Julianne Hough looked very pretty here, and you will meet a heart-broken rockstar Stacy Jaxx (Tom cruise). Tom cruise could've been done better but don't judge him by a single movie.

149,sweetboyy_99,Rock of Ages tries too hard. A hit and miss musical that leaves you disappointed.,5,28 October 2013,"This weeks movie is a rock opera-musical based on the hit Broadway musical with the same title.Directed by the same director of the well known musical called ""Hairspray"", ""Rock of Ages"" is a both hit and miss movie musical. The casting is poorly chosen, as many of them only exceed in acting, while their singing is very poorly performed. However, many of the actors in this movie adaption sing quite fair, and I wouldn't call their singing bad, however, it's not so surprising. But is this really a worthy adaption of the hit Broadway musical? At some times, yes. Some times, no. It's a hit and miss. As mentioned before, the actors do a so-so performance when it comes to the vocals, but the acting is always solid and the dialog isn't bad at all. The vocals, however, is so auto tuned,(a sign that this musical is directed by the same person that directed Hairspray) that it feels more like ""Glee"". It actually sounds pretty much like ""Glee"", which does NOT fit well in a ROCK musical. This looses the feelings of Rock music, rock is meant to be clean and raw, not polished and corrected. However, this is understandable since some of the singers aren't really the best performers. You are given a movie with an almost great soundtrack, with lots of favorites like ""I wanna rock"", ""We're not gonna take it"", ""I wanna know what love is"", ""I love Rock N' Roll"" and many others. However, the soundtrack sometimes get a little too much out of the theme. Miley Cyrus does NOT fit in a rock musical. There's so many times in this movie that I cringed. The director tried too hard and as a result, you get disappointed. I actually had high hopes for this movie, maybe too high, since when the movie was over, I was highly disappointed. I've watched the Broadway musical, and I can tell you right now that It's so much better than this movie. It's sad because I wanted it to be as good as I hoped, but it failed. Tom Cruise plays this kind of weird, confused, and animalistic rock star called Stacey Jaxx, and does a very good job. You'd be surprised how good this guy actually can sing. Julianne Hough, playing the girl Sherrie, who just moved to L.A, is doing a fairly good job. However, her voice is overly auto-tuned, and there's probably a reason for that. I haven't heard her singing voice live, but judging from this movie, and that the director felt the need to auto-tune her voice that much, proves that her singing talents are limited. But hey, I might be wrong, since I haven't really heard her sing anywhere else but in this musical. Diego Boneta, playing Drew, a bartender and singer in the rock band ""Van Colt"", performs very well through the whole movie, with solid acting and a pretty good voice too, but I can't really judge his real singing ability, since this movie is overly auto tuned.Despite the overly auto tuned effects, making it sound like Glee, the weirdly placed pop songs, and the awkward, unnecessary little moments you just want to skip, Rock of Ages is still a pretty good movie. You'll find yourself with a pretty interesting plot, singing along to the great soundtrack and the well acted characters, laughing and just having plain fun. I can't really say If you're going to like the movie, or not, since this is only MY opinions. But if you're looking for a great time, with a lot of rock songs, you can probably rent this and enjoy every minute of it. This movie is not perfect - however, it's not bad either. So if you just want to have a good time with your favorite rock songs - watch it. But don't get your hopes up too much - since the staged performance is a hundred times better than the movie itself.If you watched the staged performance - there's really no need to watch the movie.

I understand it's a spoof, but spoofs should be funny, and I didn't laugh at all in this waste of two hours of my life.I had problems with the casting. Alec Baldwin is totally miscast as the aging rock and roller owner of a nightclub. Every time he came into shot I was mesmerised by his shoulder-length wig. He seemed to be the sort that would kick back to some gentle jazz or Sinatra rather than heavy metal.Tom Cruise as a younger Iggy Pop style drunk, drugged, spaced-out sex god just didn't work. He obviously had fun in the role, but sadly I didn't.Brand's phony Scouse accent added nothing to his part, and the gay revelation between Baldwin and Brand was simply excruciating.The love interest, two young idealistic rock and rollers made Sandy & Danny from Grease look carbolic. They were too clean. When she became a stripper, it was simply unbelievable.But the biggest gripe I had was with the music. The fans devil-horned, dressed in leather, and partied like Satan worshippers. The band posters looked like an explosion between def leppard and kiss. So what sort of Rock and Roll songs did they belt out? I want to know what love is. Really? A fine ballad, but the sort of Rock and Roll that would cause churches to protest outside? Please. It made me embarrassed to be part of the generation that first bought those albums.",Rock of Ages
151,alan_holloway_2,Rock! Rock! Til You Drop!,8,13 June 2012,"Right this really should have been rubbish, to be honest. Mamma Mia for Journey fans, with Tom bloody Cruise of all people pretending to be a rock god. Okay, so it's based on a successful stage musical, but that doesn't guarantee anything. This isn't West Side Story, although to be fair West Side Story would have been improved with a Twisted Sister Song or two.It certainly gets off to a dodgy start, as Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough, Footloose) is bussing her way to Los Angeles and starts signing Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"". It's horribly cheesy and there were more than a few laughs through the cinema, one of them mine as I prepared for a very long two hours to drag by as my favourite musical genre was ripped apart and stamped on. Bollcoks Then, as soon as the horrible bus ride is over, it all gets better! Sherrie reaches L.A, falls in love with Drew Bolie (Diego Boneta, 90210), and gets a job at an infamous club The Bourbon Room. Thrust into the mix are club owner Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin, lots of stuff) and his sidekick Lonny (Russell Brand, who can't decide if he's from London or Birmingham), along with genuine rock god Stacee Jaxx (some bloke called Tom Cruise) who is to play a gig there. Along for the ride we have anti rock shrew Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta Jones, Darling Buds Of May), who wants to close the club down for good.Okay, so the plot isn't exactly Shakespeare, or even the bloke that used to clean Shakespeare's toilets (Mr Ploppy), but it's really not the point. This, my friends, is all about the music. We get songs by Journey, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, Pat Benatar, Bon Jovi, Poison, Whitesnake and more, all performed by the cast. Tom Cruise does a fine job on vocals, as does everyone else, and certain tracks really do bring a tear to the eye as the lyrics match the on screen feelings. I'm just an old softie, really.The two leads are both charming and very sexy, Cruise plays up the rock god label with total style and not a few laughs, whilst Brand and Baldwin get the best moment in the whole movie, which shall not be spoiled here. Seriously, you'll choke on your popcorn. There's even a spot for Mary J Blige as a strip club owner, and she, too, gets her chance to exercise some great pipes as she belts out Journey's ""Any Way You Want It"".Basically, Rock Of Ages should not be any good, but like Mamma Mia before it, it's brilliant if you have a genuine love of the music. Me, I am a total whore for 80s soft rock and I grinned almost all the way through. If I'd had a few beers beforehand I would have been singing along as well, so I'm glad I didn't. If you remember Dave Lee Roth, REO Speedwagon and even Starship with fondness, perhaps still have their tracks on the iPod (Ido), then you will love this movie (and the stage musical, natch). All together now don't want nothing', but a goooooood tiiime!!! (woo!)",Rock of Ages
152,pazmandy-szilvia,Wow... Greatest surprise,8,26 November 2013,"If I will ever like a Tom Cruise, it will happen because of this movie. It was such a great surprise for me, I could hardly believe to my ears at first and then my eyes when I read that Tom Cruise himself was singing! And actually pretty well! Besides his singing, I also think he gave an incredible performance as Stacee Jaxx. I do not think that rock stars are like him in this movie, but as a stereotype, he is awesome and gives everything into his role. Of course there are weak points of the film, such as the script, but if you have no great expectations, the movie is really fun. And clearly every actor enjoyed the making of it. The rock and roll is forever, it is a fact now. I keep listening the soundtrack over and over again... :-)",Rock of Ages
153,Slug-3,Real Rock,6,7 September 2014,"I'm not a fan of glee or any Broadway performances that depict cultures that conflict with the Broadway scene, because it all comes across as so contrived. And there were many things about Rock of Ages that bothered me, such as seeing Tom Cruise play Stacee Jaxx, because Cruise's 80's frat boy image ruins it for me. I also didn't think the gay scene belonged, because it just wasn't something you associated with the musicians of that scene, even though there may have been many who were gay.Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the music of that era and even found it troubling how they mixed in some good music from other eras that didn't belong. I did, however, find it refreshing to see a production about rock, which actually reflected what rock was about. Nowadays, you'll be hard pressed to find the sort of hard rebellion that was associated with rock in the past, so it's nice to see it captured here.Note to kids: Tattoos and clothing are only surface deep and only reflect rebellion in a fashion sense.",Rock of Ages
154,joetufano719,A lot of fun!,8,23 June 2012,"*No spoilers (except for the ending), just some minor plot details.My Mom and I saw this movie about a week and a half ago, and enjoyed it very much. I'm not really into musicals that much, nor have I ever been to a Broadway show, but I do have a Broadway show soundtrack on my ipod; ""Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark"" and I enjoy the music from the show very much. I've never seen the original ""Rock of Ages"" show so I can't say which version is better, but I must say I really liked the movie.The storyline was a typical love story between Sherrie and Drew: they fall in love after meeting, they break up but reunite in the end. But the love story didn't really bother me so much since there was famous 80's music mixed in. I was born in the early 90's, but I've always preferred music that was popular before I was born. I'm a big fan of 60's and 70's rock music groups/singers like the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and Queen. But I also like some 80's music and I'm also a huge fan of Bon Jovi whom he and his band started out in the 80's and one of their great songs ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" was in this movie :) Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx is terrific in every way, Alec Baldwin of course is great, and the others I thought were good too. Some of the characters' physical appearances reminded me of some famous singers: Tom Cruise's physical looks reminded me of Axl Rose, and Russell Brand as Lonny Barnett looked just like Freddie Mercury.The music is amazing. To name some of my favorites; Tom Cruise did good at covering ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" by Bon Jovi. Diego Boneta did good with ""I Wanna Rock"" and I liked the closing song ""Don't Stop Believin'"" which was originally performed by Journey since I first heard the song in the Sopranos finale.OK so this movie is not perfect and not everybody is going to like it, but I had a blast with it and left the theater with a warm feeling in my stomach. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes musicals or rock musicals in particular, 80's rock music, etc. If you don't like 80's music you probably won't care for this too much. If you're looking for something fun to watch, check it out!",Rock of Ages
155,SindarS,Musical that brings back those 80s rock hits and ballads in style,8,20 July 2018,"The story is as cheesy as it gets - a girl meets a boy, they fall in love, then there's heartbreak and so on, but the story is not the main focus here.
The movie has some great selection of rock hits and ballads from the 80s and if you enjoy those the same way I do, then you most likely won't be disappointed. The mashups of several songs into one musical act is also very well done - looks seamless and sounds great.The cast selection is decent and they do a good job for most of the movie, but do leave a bit to be desired still. The acting of Tom Cruise is spot on, however the singing part did fall a bit flat at times, at least to my liking. He just doesn't have that 80s glam rock punch in his voice. Same goes for Diego Boneta - while his singing was maybe a tad better than Cruise's, his acting wasn't up to par. Similar can be said about Julianne Hough and Mary J. Blige - they get the singing part right, but ain't spectacular in playing their roles.You can definitely spot the Hollywood influence on this classical Broadway show as the movie does feel Glee-like, which might bother some people. I personally, didn't mind it that much - I'm sure that if the movie would have been made in late 80s or 90s it would definitely look and feel much different.Overall however I did enjoy the movie - it got back those original 80s hits into my music playlist for a while.

158,kgmarra,High School Musical cheese-fest..,4,25 June 2012,"You know a movie is bad when Russell Brand is the best actor in it. ""Rock of Ages"" is a musical that is infused with 80s rock music. Tom Cruise, Julianne Hough, Diego Boneta, Paul Giamatti, Alec Baldwin, and Catherine Zeta-Jones star in this cheesy remake of a hit Broadway show.Sherrie Christian (Hough) is a small-town girl from Oklahoma who decides to pursue her dreams of being a singer in Los Angeles (it already sounds like ""Burlesque""). Upon arriving, she is mugged and loses her favorite records. Drew Boley (Boneta), a city boy, witnesses Sherrie being mugged and helps her out by getting her a job where he works, at the Bourbon Room.Stacee Jaxx (Cruise), the front man of an Aerosmith-like band named Arsenal, is set to play at the Bourbon Room for his last performance before going solo. Arsenal is one of Sherrie's favorite bands, causing her to be ecstatic when she finds out that her idols are performing right where she works.Sherrie and Drew naturally fall for each other and break out into song to sing about their feelings whenever they have the chance. These moments that are reminiscent of scenes from ""High School Musical"" produce an unrealistic film. As mentioned above, Russell Brand is the only actor who gives a believable and genuinely comedic performance. Tom Cruise is passable as an alcoholic sex-maniac who is emotionally wrecked. Everyone else presents over-the-top, downright bad acting.The music is the only enjoyable aspect of this unnecessarily two-hour-long movie. I found myself laughing at its stupidity on several occasions and, personally, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. However, I have heard and read some extremely positive opinions about this musical as well.I give ""Rock of Ages"" a 4 out of 10. Go ahead and see it for yourself.",Rock of Ages

The pacing is mess. It started slowly. When it got tighter. When it was slow until the last gig.
The movie told two entirely different storys. It was a romace of two young adults and it was story about crazy rockstar. The rockstar storyline was quite coherent unlike the love story. Why did the couple break up? Why did the girl quit? Those were explained in blink and miss scenes.
Also the movie was just too long. It felt like forever.",Rock of Ages
160,UberGoober1411,A fun-filled movie experience that's a great excuse to listen to 80's music,7,22 June 2012,"I'll start off by stating that I have never seen the Rock of Ages Broadway play so I had no expectations coming into the movie, aside from the fact that I really wanted to hear Tom Cruise sing Pour Some Sugar on Me. I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise from the beginning but his performance in this film speaks otherwise. He did an outstanding job as the lead rock star Stacee Jaxx. The chemistry between him and Malin Ackerman's character, Rolling Stone writer Constance Sack, was breathtakingly beautiful. Rolling around Tom Cruise's HQ at the Bourbon Room and singing I Want to Know What Love Is was an absolutely amazing display of vocal prowess and talent. It was amazing seeing these two work together and I only wish that this movie was longer, if only by 5 minutes.The music chosen to be included in this movie was also outstanding, truly exemplifying the 80's genre. There were some songs that did not make it in, like I Just Died (In Your Arms Tonight) and Keep On Loving you, but it could be argued that the genre of these songs is new-wave Pop, not Rock n' Roll. Regardless, the choices made and displayed in the movie were perfect, ranging from Night Ranger's (pardon me) Sister Christian to Journey's Don't Stop Believing (unfortunately). The choreography in the film to go along with the songs was questionable at best but it is also difficult to take a Broadway and put it to screen.I also thought the chemistry between two unlikely characters was good too: Alec Baldwin as Dennis Dupree and Russel Brand as Lonny, for reasons I shall not mention in this review.The plot, unfortunately, was very week. The lead female role, Sherrie Christian played by Julianne Hough, goes to Hollywood looking for fame and fortune (and everything that comes with it) only to have her bags stolen within the first 10 minutes of entering the city. She then meets Drew Boley, a simply guy who has dreams of rock n' roll and who too left home for Hollywood - he offers her a job at the Bourbon Room and the love starts. It was a predictable love story and the chemistry between these too never quite reaches the peak that the chemistry between Cruise and Ackerman defined. Nevertheless, this alone does not keep the movie from losing points. There is quite a bit of comedy in the movie and will keep you laughing hysterically, especially when Tom Cruise is on-screen (by now you should have a pretty good idea that he is a freaking awesome character). The comedy keeps the movie more fun and lighthearted, and makes a good transition into the musical portions.In the end, Rock of Ages definitely is the best musical of the year (although it'll probably be the only one) and is so far the best musical of the 2010-2019 decade. Tom Cruise does a stellar performance, the musical choice for the soundtrack is exceptional, and although the story lacks depth and creativity at some points, the comedy and transitional effects between movie and musical make up for it.+3 for Tom Cruise's performance +1 for chemistry between Cruise & Ackerman +1 for chemistry between Baldwin & Brand +2 for music selection",Rock of Ages

Tom Cruise is actually really good in this... he captured the era's ego-maniacal rock overdrive effectively. I just couldn't take anything about the storyline seriously having to listen to Hough's minimal singing talent.

166,xThe_Fury,Rock of Ages - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,6,17 June 2012,"""Rock of Ages"" is a musical that uses 80's rock anthems and combines it with a genuine love story that hopes to give you the best musical experience since ""Hairspray."" With a star studded cast which includes names like Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin, and all the talent featured in the movie it can be expected that this will be a fun film and put musicals pack on the map.The movie is about Sherrie (Julianne Hough), who leaves her home in Oklahoma to head to Los Angeles so she can pursue her dream to be a singer. On the way she meets Drew (Diego Boneta), who is a bar back at the legendary Bourbon Room, who is also trying to achieve his goal and be the next rock icon. As their romance builds, the Bourbon Room is getting prepared for rock legend Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) to play his last show with his band Arsenal.The vocal talent in this film was amazing. Every big name in the film offered vocals, even Alec Baldwin, and they all sounded great. The pace of this film was very fast because they were jumping into songs quickly; I don't think there was a fifteen minute period in the whole movie without a song. The film editing was impressive; they cut to many different locations when there were a bunch of characters contributing to a song and it was put together beautifully. The climax of the film was a little too early in the film. I think they should have made the Stacee Jaxx show a little further in the movie because after that, it really kind of slowed down a bit.I enjoyed and had fun with this film. The film was cheesy, but I think it is expected to be cheesy and the film itself knows its cheesy so that's why it works. If you grew up in the 80s this movie will touch home for and bring back memories. I recommend this movie for fans of the 80s and musicals in general. Tom Cruise's performance is worth price of admission alone. 3 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",Rock of Ages
167,brunowangtaiwan,Predictable but great summer fun!,8,20 June 2012,"No spoilers but some minor plot discussion.For starters, let me say that Bruno Wang is not a hater. This movie seems to have garnered either extreme loyalty or extreme hatred and very little in between. The fact is, the film succeeds on many levels and yet is hardly a blockbuster....mostly because of the acting of the primary characters of the film, Julienne Hough and Diego Boneta. This is a musical, an adaptation of a Broadway Show, and like the director's (Adam Shankman) previous ""Hairspray"" this film is rife with super corny lead-ins to songs and bits and pieces of attempts at humor and emotion. While it does mildly succeed in some of the actual drama, it clearly hits a home run with the singing. The very beginning sequence features Sherrie Christian (Hough) taking the bus from Oklahoma to Los Angeles to become a star and the entire bus breaks out in ""Sister Christian,"" at that point you know you are in for a ride of parody, whimsy and just good old-fashioned fun.The key is to let yourself go right there and get into the fun of the film. Yes, it is a predictable boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy get girl again story. The acting by the two young love interests is tepid at best...but the mixture of 1980s era rock songs and the superb acting by the big named artists, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamatti and of course Tom Cruise more than makes up for the vapid story line. Tom Cruise is worth the price of admission alone. He plays aging rocker Stacee Jaxx and he absolutely crushes it. He is a self-absorbed, party- wasted rocker who has a monkey for a sidekick and two beastly bodyguards. Not only does he take the role to it's insane rocker-parody peak, he belts out some pretty hefty tunes along the way. No matter what you think of Cruise, he pours himself into his roles and he leaves nothing on the table with this performance. Paul Giamatti is another who really steals the show. The looks on his face alone in some of the scenes is enough to make you laugh out loud. Giamatti plays Paul Gill, who is Stacee Jaxx's agent. Gill is struggling to get Jaxx's solo career off the ground while also trying to play into the evolving pop world of the 80s and the emergence of boy bands etc. The entire dialog surrounding the commercialization of rock and roll is the only serious thread in the film. Very few musicals are ultra successful at the box office, and Rock of Ages is probably not going to break any box office records. It is however a fun summer movie. even if you don't know all the tunes that the film features, I guarantee that you will be humming a couple on your way out of the theater.I give this movie a Bruno Wang 4 out of 5 stars for a simple, corny, fun-filled good time at the theater.

168,chloe-webb-01,Rock of ages COULD have been amazing,6,14 June 2012,"I have submitted a 6 for this movie, which is just above average. I was disappointed with it due to the following reasons: The beginning was way too fast, she stepped off the bus, lost her suitcase and was given a job by a boy who fell in love with her instantly. There was no discussion of how she got there, her previous life (apart from the song lyrics, which most of the time didn't match up) and a lot of little things annoyed me. For one- Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx, he was mumbling throughout the whole movie, taking long pauses for that 'wow' effect, (which eventually got boring) and he was not attractive enough to be a stud rock star.A better cast would have made it a lot better. Although there were no hold backs on women dressed appealing. The hairstyles were not as accurate as the could have been. The lead guy 'Drew' had skater hair?? The Hollywood sign was small in scale. The songs were not even the major hits that represented 80s rock. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand as a couple just made it weird.

It is one of those movies that the more I think about it..I will most likely enjoy even more a second time. The writing is hysterical with several laugh out loud lines. It also has some outrageously funny dance numbers that go with the classic 80's tunes. Like another reviewer, I found the weakest part were the acting performances of the two younger leads.

I'll watch any genre of movie and if its done right with intelligence, logic (within its own rules) and passion then I'm likely to enjoy it. And I really surprisingly enjoyed this! Everything in this movie works towards making a very fun, entertaining experience and, without spoiling anything, there are some really surprising, passionate scenes that I didn't expect to see. Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand supplying some stand-out moments, truly refreshing romance there fellas, I didn't see that one coming! Musicals are low on my list of must-sees but there are some brilliant ones out there and this is up there with the very best. You'd have to have a heart made of stone if you didn't feel the love that was put into this film. It felt like all the actors really cared and were having a great time making it.Tom Cruise was shockingly good as Tracie and I swear he was trying to channel Iggy Pop in his live number at the Bourbon (the contortions early on on stage were the clue that Tom had studied footage of the Man himself!) He definitely put everything he had into this movie and deserves praise for carrying off a role such as this in a movie as silly as Rock of Ages! I just think the negative reviewers are trying to be too hip and cool for their own good. Yes the music is a bit MOR, watered down if you like, and not to everyones taste and yes the film isn't breaking any barriers but it was done in such a refreshing, spirited and fun way that to not be able to put that to one side, relax and have fun is frankly ridiculous.We live in tough, miserable times.

Russell Brand's attempt at a Birmingham accent is dreadful - I don't suppose in a film like this anyone takes things seriously enough to hire a dialogue coach. Apparently the accent this was a nod to Ozzy Osbourne.Unfortunately the film as a whole was carrying out its own tribute to Ozzy, as like him the plot proceeded to stumble painfully from one fiasco to the next. Obviously you're not meant to take the story that seriously since it just has to tee up the songs. But having given us a storyline, and a few actors presumably not hired for their singing ability like Bryan Cranston, Alec Baldwin and Paul Giamatti, why did the storyline have to be such a load of utter cack? We get a duplicitous mayor, a Washington wife determined to close down rock and roll, a superstar who's lost his edge and an oily manager who compromises the spirit of Rock; but they're just kind of thrown in and left there, like a chef deciding to serve fish but instead of cooking anything up, just grabbing a couple of trout out of the tank and leaving them to flop around on your table. I'm not saying it has to be Shakespeare, but a bit of actual storytelling would have made it a little more entertaining. As opposed to completely unentertaining.Clearly though, the songs are what everyone has turned up for. As a fan of a lot of the rock music of the 80s I was hoping there would be good selection of songs to enjoy. But sadly, (and the film is perhaps saddled with the song choices of the original show), it manages to sidestep almost every decent song of the era. Instead we get most of the worst, most rancid, unlistenable dreck served up in that decade, with only a few decent tracks featured at all. We are treated to three (My God! THREE!) songs by the appalling Poison, two songs from Twisted Sister's worst album, a never-ending parade of MOR garbage by Foreigner and their ilk and the insipid More Than Words. The song that inspired the show's title, Rock of Ages, doesn't feature at all, which isn't that brilliant a song but it's Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love rolled into one compared to most of the songs that did make it in. Frankly, when the defenders of the Rock and Roll flame choose as their anthem the indefensible ""We Built This City"" by Starship, I felt like picking up a placard and joining the joyless Church harridans on the other side of the barricade.In terms of individual performances, Mary J Blige (the cause of my original curiosity) sounds great but isn't given any good songs to sing. Tom Cruise in theory was a good choice for an eye-catching guest star role but is usually so unsettling when he's on screen that I had to look away several times. His rendition of Bon Jovi's Wanted Dead or Alive (possibly the best song in the film) is like something Christian Bale might have improvised as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, only to be discarded as just too disturbing for audiences to handle. He has a couple of decent moments: I did chuckle at Cruise being disrupted by a fan jumping in to kiss him at a crucial moment, and everyone patiently waiting until she finishes and faints dead away. But there aren't enough of them.The lead actors are bland and forgettable, giving it the usual jazz hands and perky expressions you can expect to see in High School Musical, Glee or an X Factor live final. Unfortunately this just increases the feeling that you're watching a bad variety show rather than a big Broadway/West End Musical. This isn't helped by the insistence on irritating mash-ups of two or occasionally three songs at a time. And when they're mostly crap songs they don't sound any better being sung over the top of other crap songs. The signature tune of the show, Don't Stop Believing, has been covered and ""reimagined"" so many times that it just goes in one ear and out the other here. I wasn't expecting much but far too often I couldn't help cringing, hands over my face, at the embarrassing spectacle on display. Yes it's cheesy and a bit of nostalgic enjoyment of old rock songs would have been fine, but there are hardly any genuinely good rock songs here. They haven't bothered to open out the show as a film at all, and the tone of the film is just wrong. It would have been great to infuse a celebration of the music (and feature more of the actual people who made the original music), with some knowing humour. They could have made it into a late night classic, doing for classic rock what The Blues Brothers did for classic rhythm and blues. But the kind of wit and skillful handling needed to make that happen is glaringly absent here, leaving in its place just a hefty slice of grim karaoke featuring the most flavourless radio-friendly crimes against proper rock music.If you take the metal out of hair metal, all you have left is smelly leather trousers and a hole in the ozone layer - and this is what Rock of Ages feels like.",Rock of Ages

Apart from a G'N'R-flirt, the closest thing to hardrock you will hear is 1 Whitesnake and 1 Scorpions song. This will give you an idea of what too expect!This is supposed to represent the music scene in LA, with focus on Sunset Strip around 1987. Really?! Are you kidding me?! Several of these bands had nothing do do with the ""scene"" there and so many that SHOULD have been represented are not! Performing wise then? Well some of the performances are that bad, but most really aren't that good. Meaning; a real singer can role outta bed 3 in the morning hung over and having smoked 2 packs of cigarettes and still sing better, but the actors do OK. The huge problems is no feeling....90% of it have absolutely no feeling at all. When it comes to that it sounds cold and clinical with zero attachment to the song they're singing. Maybe I'm biased here since I'm a musician myself, but I really expected a bit more than this! Make me belief that you BELIEVE in what your singing about. Gimme some emotion here......alas...none! Honestly I couldn't even see the whole thing without hitting fast forward to get past to most embarrassing parts. If you are a Tom Cruise fanatic you might enjoy this. If you love musicals, sure...why not. If you grew up with 80's rock, hardrock, heavy metal....well no.If you want a rockmovie that beats this by lightyears both acting and performing wise...see Rockstar with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston.

Not great just good.Stand outs for me were Julianne Hough as Sherrie and Diego Boneta as Drew. I loved that they're not the biggest names in Hollywood, but they got the main part. Russell Brand was his usual self, Alec Baldwin looked god awful with his long hair, Mary J.

All the actors did a good job in this movie, especially tom cruise, Alec Baldwin, and the lead young actors. The story is great at illustrating the fact that no matter what new music styles come out, no matter what the bible thumpers say, rock lives on. And of course the music was kick ass, every song was awesome and illustrated the story wonderfully.

The songs were great, and the actors performed every 80's hit well. I can honestly say that every person who sang in the film was great.This movie stars Julianne Hough (Burlesque, Footloose), Diego Boneta (Mean Girls 2, Pretty Little Liars), Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Minority Report), Alec Baldwin (The Departed, Beetlejuice), Russell Brand (Get Him to the Greek, Arthur), Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad), Catherine Zeta- Jones (Chicago, The Terminal), Paul Giamatti (Saving Private Ryan, Sideways), Will Forte (That's My Boy, Saturday Night Live), Eli Roth (Inglourious Basterds, Piranha), and Mary J. Blige (Prison Song, I Can Do Bad All By Myself).The plot is that Sherrie (Julianne Hough) travels to Hollywood to make it big and ends up running into Drew (Diego Boneta) who helps her get a job were he works through Dennis (Alec Baldwin). The place they work at host big rock and roll shows. Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) is set to play there as his career is not looking so good. Patricia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the Mayor's wife, is trying to stop the rock and roll scene.The movie was defiantly fun to watch and the music really gets you into the thrill of the film. The only thing that brought the movie down was how cheesy it was at some points and how everyone can just randomly bust out singing then go back to reality like nothing happened, I know that happens in a lot of musicals, but still I like it to be more realistic in a sense, if you understand what I mean.

There isn't a single thing about this movie that vaguely resembles the words ""Rock and Roll"" except the title of the movie.If you are a 14 year old girl who loves Glee see this movieotherwise SKIP IT!!! Where is the grit of Rock? The lead female singer has a VERY GIRLIE POP voice that would be perfect for a pop musical or the Lion King, but she doesn't have an ounce of rock and roll in her body. She makes Hanna Montana look hardcore. She makes Smurfette look edgy. We are talking ZERO grit or edge! Disney POP VOCALS abusing rock lyrics! I like Adam Shankman from So You Think You Can Dance, but SHAME ON YOU ADAM for misusing the words Rock. Sure they repeated rock and roll lyrics but in a pathetic, bubble gum Glee musical version. It was so grating to watch. You clearly don't HAVE A CLUE what Rock and Roll is. This actually angered me to watch it was such an insult to music.The story line was pathetic and the jokes amateurish. I laughed 2 times in 2 hours.There were minor amusements in this movie (which is why it gets a 3 not a 1). Tom Cruise was pretty good. You just have to SUFFER through 2+ hours of Disney pop CRAP!

184,mmccord9126,A Reason for Avoiding Musicals,3,15 June 2012,"Okay, I'll give credit where it's due. Tom Cruise did a great job of portraying an aging rock star, albeit over the top. And, of course, his ability to take on the actual signing, on relatively short notice, was impressive. And that's my point: take him out of the film and you have a big fat nothing.To me, it was simply a collection of well-choreographed music videos held loosely together by one of the weakest screenplays I've experienced in a long time. When one looks back at past musicals of note (Chicago, for example), this one was lacking in any sense of accomplishment. Yes, I know, it wasn't to be taken seriously - how could it be? I'd like to say that it was, at least, worth it to see Zeta-Jones back in form. I am, however, convinced that this was, without a doubt her all time worst performance in a film. What was she thinking when she accepted the totally ridiculous role as the L.A. mayor's inhibited, self-denying wife? It just wants to make you cringe to think that such a talented actress would subject herself to such humiliation. Maybe I just didn't get it.Without resorting to details, the scene between Baldwin and Brand's characters (anyone whose seem the film knows which one) was unsettling and absurd. It didn't affect me personally, but it just didn't seem right or appropriate.I've never been a fan of watching characters in a film break out into spontaneous song in the middle of even a mildly dramatic scene. It always grabs me the wrong way. Thank the gods that it doesn't happen in real life.In the end, if you're in to musicals you'll probably like this one. If not, like me, you've likely suffered through it for someone else's benefit. But hey, we all have to do that at some point.

186,jaychou_21,"Great music, mediocre covers, bad movie",6,16 June 2012,"""Rock of Ages"" tells the story of small town girl Sherrie and city boy Drew who crossed paths while pursuing their dreams in Hollywood. Their romance is told through the hits of Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi, Journey, Foreigner, and other rock 'n roll icons.If it weren't for the great musical inspiration from which this film laid its groundwork, ""Rock of Ages"" would have fallen severely flat. Director Adam Shankman tried to burn the house down, but their fire phoenix got trapped. With what an amazing cast (Tom Cruise, Julianne Hough, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin, Paul Giamatti, among others), how could something as phenomenal as this fail to uplift? The poorly-written script is to be blamed for its downfall. Consumed by its own vanity, the dismissive plot is full of clichés and cringe-worthy antics. In the script's own words, 'like a man-child stuck in a rut,' the screenplay kept toying with the subject but did not capture the true spirit of rock 'n roll nor the affinity of its characters toward the material.With 17 musical numbers (if my memory serves me right) and only a handful of standouts, ""Rock of Ages"" is limited in terms of audience engagement and is clearly void of soul. It's like a rocked-out version of Glee, though I can't decide which one is tackier.Nevertheless, the film offers a healthy dose of guilty pleasure. From the dazzling charm of Julianne Hough to Catherine Zeta-Jones' commanding presence to a scantily-clad Tom Cruise, the film does what movie musicals do best: delight the viewers with short-lived moments of rapture.

189,josh_youngbwfc,Rock 'n' Roll is dead?,4,2 July 2012,"Rock of Ages is the big screen adaptation of hugely successful stage musical of the same name featuring some of the biggest rock songs of the 1980s. Bringing musicals to the big screen isn't anything new with Mamma Mia, Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street and, later on this year, even Les Miserables all featuring in cinemas.Rock of Ages is the story of a small town girl and a city boy who meet on the Sunset Strip whilst pursuing their dreams in Hollywood. Their love faces challenges with accusations of betrayal, self doubts and the threatened closure of famous rock club the Bourbon all playing a part in their relationship.Tom Cruise is Stacee Jaxx; lead singer of huge rock band Arsenal and a stereotypical 'sex, drugs and rock and roll' rock star who has gone off the rails. Although, whilst the marketing of Rock of Ages will tell you this is a Tom Cruise film if you do go see it just for him then you will be disappointed. The main roles fall to professional dancer Julianne Hough and pretty boy Mexican actor Diego Boneta who are both actually really good to watch with a clear chemistry on screen and the two put in very enjoyable performances. Alec Baldwin, Bryan Cranston and Mary J. Blige all put in sustainable supporting performances whilst Catherine Zeta Jones puts in a performance that makes you question how you never found her annoying at all before this. Paul Giamatti is always reliable and does enough here as Stacee Jaxx's agent. Russell Brand is awful; his accent constantly changing throughout the film, the delivery of his lines drier than the desert and his all round persona just stinking of desperation to be adored; whoever cast Brand in this film and keeps casting him in other films should really take a good hard look at themselves and ask them why they are doing this.But it is the musical numbers that draw in fans of musicals and there are plenty of big songs featured in Rock of Ages: Journey's Don't Stop Believin, Foreigner's Jukebox Hero, Poison's Every Rose Has It's Thorn as well as We Built This City by Starship. And the musical numbers are executed very well, fantastic vocals, loud music that create a very real atmosphere and an enjoyable two or three minutes when the songs are on.Unfortunately though, everything else that isn't being sung is incredibly dull. A lot of the comedy is misplaced and falls flat and for a light hearted musical the laughs are a pretty important part to enjoyment. The characters are very two dimensional and the dialogue is poorly written and feels very forced at times. It's a musical so you can look past how quickly people fall in love and form a relationship because that's what musicals are all about; a sense of utopia. But poor dialogue, poor characters, poor story lines and an all round poor structure take away from the solid performances and good musical numbers because it's just not enjoyable as a film.Lots of video games and books that are turned into films are very criticised heavily leading to calls for books and video games to be left on their own platforms and I think the same needs to be said here. Big musicals do well because they include the audience, they make the audience feel like they are a part of the whole performance (something for which Rock of Ages, the stage musical, takes very seriously and is very well known for) and doing this is not possible with films, you do not get the full musical experience watching on a screen.This is something that should have been left on the stage and, despite Tom Cruise's involvement and a great soundtrack, all round fails as a film.",Rock of Ages
190,Joshsports60,"Was not quite the Rock of Ages, but close",7,2 May 2012,"*There are no real spoilers in this review, just some minor plot details.I had the privilege of being able to see this at an advance screening a couple of months ago. Just to let you know, I have never seen the Broadway show, so I can't compare the two.On one hand, Tom Cruise stole the show as he always does. He plays the role of aging rocker Stacee Jaxx, tasked with saving the Bourbon Room from the villainous Patricia Whitmore's (Zeta-Jones) wrath. He has a killer voice, and he shared some great chemistry with journalist Constance Sack (Malin Akerman). I think everybody is going to love those two together.On the other hand, the two lovebirds Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) and Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) just did not bring a lot of chemistry. And their acting ability is so far inferior to the likes of the Cruises, Baldwins, and the Giamattis of the world. And when they are the leads, it kind of brings down the movie a little bit. The singing was great, but isn't that the standard for musicals? I would've preferred Brittany Snow be cast alongside the original Drew Constantine Maroulis. Even though I have not seen the original play live, I've seen numerous of his performances either live or on the computer.Another critique I have is that the whole thing is a little too much. This film felt a little busy to me. I almost wish someone would have told Adam Shankman to tone it down a little because it fizzled a little towards the end.The musical numbers in were just incredible. As someone in the younger generation, I don't believe I could appreciate the the 80s music as much as the people born in the later 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. But, make no mistake, every single number was executed pretty well. I happened to like the performances more than Shankman's previous musical, Hairspray.It was legitimately funny. Even if you don't like Tom Cruise personally, he kills it in every movie he's in. His scenes are the best. I was also impressed by the performances of Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, and Paul Giamatti. Even singer Mary J. Blige got involved.This is a movie that is some big time fun. It's not for everybody, as the person sitting next to me reminded me of.

192,mattpope384,Fascinated by Rock of Ages,8,4 January 2014,"I suspect that reactions to Rock of Ages are more emotional than technical.I loved this movie even though there are many technical reasons why I shouldn't. For instance, I am generally not a fan of musicals. I never saw the big deal about Grease and I had zero interest in seeing Mamma Mia or Hairspray. ROA is a camp-fest and has a feel-good Hollywood ending (more so than the Broadway musical does), but I am still compelled to watch ROA whenever its on.This movie resonates for me for reasons that are largely personal and emotional. For one, I love stories about L.A. (even though ironically, it was actually filmed in Florida). As a kid growing up on the East Coast, my unconscious dream was to grow up and move to California (which I did). Hollywood Blvd, Wilshire Blvd, Sunset, Santa Monica- even in New Jersey I knew these names long before I became a resident of the Golden State. So the fantasy-like depiction of LA as a place where people go to launch their lives and shape their destinies- warts and all- had resonance.Second is the timing of the movie. ROA starts in May of 1987 when I was a junior in high school. I loved hard rock and heavy metal at that time: AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Ozzy Osbourne when I was an angsty adolescent and the more pop-ish hard rock of Poison and Def Leppard as a teen.Having the music of my idealistic youth re-imagined as a story was fun and intriguing (although it freaks me out that Julianne Hough wasn't even born until about a year until after the time period this movie was set-about when I was graduating HS).And of course, the movie is just fun in my opinion. A great diversion to lose yourself in. Very little serious edge - just a chance to enjoy some campy silliness while vainly reveling in the music of one's youth and remembering the excitement of being ready to start one's life and its seemingly endless possibilities.Of course the performances are fun. Hough is adorable in my opinion and Diego Boneta has a genuine rocker voice and presence. Brand, Gill, Baldwin and Akerman we're comedic and charming in their roles and Tom Cruise really did create a compelling Axel Rose/Jim Morrison spirit. Silly as it was, ROA is also a pretty good history lesson of the late 80's rock scene on the Sunset and the encroaching rise of 90's boyband pop.There is one thing that I really disliked about the movie however, which is why I took away a star: there was no reason to include the character of Heyman the Baboon. I am not a fan of using wild animals for human entertainment and there was no plot need for this character to be in the movie. It was just a throw in for the kiddies, I suspect.",Rock of Ages

Although music born before my time, each number was memorable and well known to me. The iconic actors in this film played unconventional roles that was both refreshing and highly entertaining, Tom Cruise especially. He did a fantastic performance that won't be forgotten in a hurry. I particularly found interesting the homo-social bonding between Baldwin and Brand that gradually developed into something much more significant that illustrated this obvious sexual energy through a catchy number. However, the relationship between Boley and Christian seemed very 'High School Musicalish' to me which subtly bothered me but in no way overshadowed their overall spectacular performance.

Half will love it, half will hate it. It's not perfect but it's not trying to be, I think. It's a big, dumb, loud musical so expectations can be anywhere. Maybe it should be more than dumb, maybe some people should settle for the fun, they all are reasonable. It's a take it how you will flick. Of course, it doesn't hold the energy and the presence the stage performance and that's where it lacks some sense and fun. So, for those who like the setting, musicals, and 80's rock, give it a try. If you know you aren't going to have fun with it, it's not a time changer.",Rock of Ages

Too blond to have a brain, with a pop voice not so unique, all she can do is pole dance on the top of Mount Rushmore and flip her hair singing oooo yeeeaaaaah on each song. Too tacky, sorry. Now, supporting cast: Alec Baldwin, okay, he can pull it off. Drunk Russell Howard, meh, okay, his glory days as Katie Perry's hubby paid off. Paul Gimatti is famous for being the funny obnoxious assistant, so, sure, why not. But believe me when I'm telling you that the worst supporting act was from Mr. Cruise, Tom Cruise. Oh-so-ridiculous.

197,harbhippo,Please tell me the stage version is better. Please.,2,13 December 2013,"Several of my friends (who have good taste in entertainment) have given the stage production of Rock of Ages a thumbs up. GA and I aren't going to New York any time soon, and if we did, there are shows we'd be more likely to buy tickets for, so we decided to check out Rock of Ages the film. Please tell me this is one of those deals where the show just fails to make the transition from the stage version - I know that happens sometimes. We hit the stop button fifteen minutes in. What's supposed to be good? If it's the music, the numbers I saw were no improvement over the original releases. And even if they were, you could get the soundtrack and not have to endure this noisome failure of a film. The acting? No way. I may have to watch War of the Worlds again just to get a better vision of Tom Cruise than what I saw last night. What I saw was a series of tired clichés for a plot, and a city block full of caricatures for a cast. There was nothing to laugh at. There was no legitimate point being made. Granted we left early - and I rarely do that, even with a weak film - but if the producers were planning to change directions after the opening stank so badly, that's generally a mistake. So we watched ""28 Weeks Later"" instead. Much better entertainment, thank you very much. Watching the UK collapse in horror for the second time in four weeks is a much better choice than what we had originally planned.",Rock of Ages
198,tsh85,terrible,1,23 May 2013,"This movie somehow reminded me of a really bad episode of Glee. Lots of untalented people singing other peoples songs. Truly awful cover versions of every song here. I can't believe they hired Ron Anderson to (vocally) coach these actors, and this is the best they could come up with? What a complete waste of money on their part.This movie had a terrible script, and it's no wonder that it failed to fall short of its budget. It's sad when you spend 75 million dollars making a movie and you end up losing over 15 million dollars after it's released. It seemed like every actor was given different direction as to how to interpret their roles. I would rather be stabbed in the eye with an ice pick than forced to watch this movie again.Let me begin by saying that I grew up in Hollywood, and worked at Tower Records on the Sunset Strip from 1985-1987 (age 16-18). I was a huge part of the ""Hollywood Scene"" which is so poorly portrayed in this movie. Every Friday and Saturday night I would be at The Troubadour, Gazzarri's, Whiskey, Roxy, and the Rainbow Bar and Grill. I knew every band that played in Hollywood during this period. I used to hang out with all of the guys from Warrant, Poison, G N R, Bill Gazzarri, etc. Doug Goldstein (Tour Manager for Guns N' Roses) was one of my best friends.The guys in Poison were all friends of mine. They were so poor that they all shared a one bedroom apartment off of Ventura Blvd. Back in those days, they actually had to pay the clubs to let them play. I can remember watching Poison play at the Troubadour in 1986. After the show, we all went back to their apartment to watch MTV because it was the debut of their first music video. It was the band, myself, and 7 of our friends all sitting on their living room floor, around the television, eating pizza, and drinking champagne. The reason we all sat on the floor was because they were so poor, they couldn't afford furniture, and only had one small sofa in their living room. I spent many days hanging out with band members such as: Bret, Rikki, Axl, Duff, and Izzy (from GNR), Jani (from Warrant). We used to cruise up and down Sunset Boulevard in my convertible with the top down shouting at people.This movie was set to take place in 1987. If anybody knows what the ""scene"" was like in 87' it's me. I can honestly say, without a doubt, this movie does not even come close to how it really was. They got most of the music wrong, the clothing is atrocious, the language (nobody called people brother and brother man....everybody was referred to as dude), and every aspect that they tried to bring back was most certainly lost in translation. First let me say that some of the music in this movie wasn't even recorded yet, during the period of time this film is trying to portray. Where is the spandex? Where are the bangle bracelets? Where is the Aqua Net hairspray? Those were the three best friends of every band member in 1987, and none of them would be caught dead without all three in their possession at all times. It's almost like the person that coordinated this film had never been to Hollywood in his life, and most certainly did not grow up there during the late 80's.SkidRow didn't even make it to Hollywood until late 89-90's. It really bothers me when people take a movie and try to portray a certain period of time, but they completely miss the mark on every aspect. This is what this movie did in every way, shape, and form. There are very few bands that everyone on the Sunset Strip listened to between in 1987. The bands that were playing the strip during this period are: Poison, Plain Jane (who later became Warrant), L.A. Guns, Pretty Boy Floyd, Guns N' Roses, Ratt, BulletBoys, Dokken, Rough Cutt, Jetboy, Black and Blue, Kix, Great White, Faster Pussycat, Motley Crue. There were also bands that had already become extremely popular and famous such as: Tesla, The Cult, Bon Jovi, Hanoi Rocks. This is the music that was played in every club during this period, not Pat Benetar, Extreme, REO Speedwagon, Quarterflash, Loverboy, Foreigner, Styx, etc...Let me say that Cruise did an excellent job in this movie. Supposedly he was portraying Axl? I knew Axl in real life, and no way was he anything like the character in this movie, but I don't blame Tom Cruise for this....I blame the director and writer. I guarantee the part was written wrong, and I'm sure that Tom Cruise absolutely nailed the character they were going for. Yes, the real Axl was always wasted, always late, always surrounded by beautiful women, and always wore long coats and lots of jewelry, but the writers have made him out to be a complete psycho, and Axl was nothing of the sort. He was extremely intelligent and always aware of his surroundings, even when he was wasted. He just didn't care about anybody, and did whatever he wanted. The one thing that I remember most about Axl was his bad temper. He fought with everybody and he was very abusive verbally and physically. He liked trouble and always managed to find it; he also loved to fight with anybody about anything. I've seen him beat people up backstage at his shows simply because he thought that they said something about him. I can honestly say he was probably the wildest person I have ever known.Like I said, if you haven't seen this movie yet don't waste your time. It would be more fun to take hot needles and stick them in your eyeballs.",Rock of Ages
199,Plezsno,"Let the road take you, elsewhere.",5,18 July 2013,"Anxiously, I sat on the couch anticipating a meander down memory lane. A frolic, if you will, into a past where, as Julianne Hough mentioned in interviews, musicians wrote and really cared about their songs. While the movie certainly delivered on that avenue, the rest of movie felt forced. The plot, the performances, the scenes all set up and staged, like street on a Hollywood back lot. It's as if the writers stopped writing and thought ""Now it's time to add a song."" and ""Now it's time to add a plot twist."" and, of course, we'd need a GPS to get us back on track if we didn't have the occasional ""Now, it's time for a woman in her underwear."" to keep the story moving in the right direction.Like accidentally finding a fantastic diner in some small town right next to the highway, hiding somewhere within the expected plot and character clichés, I was hoping to run into something special - like clever 80's jokes or references - more than just a Donkey Kong machine in the background. Naming the main character, Sherrie Christian was a good start. Also, the requisite cameos were fun, but interest in the story was carried by a few unexpected and probably unnecessary plot twists, although they certainly kept my mental wheels spinning, possibly not for the right reasons. The second half does seem to move more briskly than the first as the conflicts and characters come together.Here's a drive-by on the music. Song choices are solidly and satisfyingly 80's rock, except a quick side trip to make fun of pop. The lead voices seemed above average until Mary J Blige hopped on board and made the rest of the cast sound like they'd be lucky to be back up singers on a children's float. That's not to say they were bad; Mary J is just that good.Bottom line is that if you have a reason to see this movie, like your friend was an extra or your love of Malin Ackerman can't fit into a Terex dump truck, it's probably best just to keep moving.",Rock of Ages
200,thehappyspaceman,Just silly enough to be a guilty pleasure.,6,20 November 2015,"Rock of Ages is one of the big musical bombs, to the point where Motley Crue wouldn't even let their music be used for it, but is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Well, let's look at the bad parts of this movie. The characters are clichéd, the storyline is predictable, the pacing is slow, and there are numerous unresolved subplots. But if you look past all that, I found it to be actually a lot of fun. I think most of that is owed to its great soundtrack, where every singer in the movie sings some surprisingly impressive renditions of '80s classics. Also, Tom Cruise seems to be having a lot of fun with his performance. It's a guilty pleasure to say the least. Or most. Take whatever you want from that.",Rock of Ages

Back stories were quite entertaining such as pop band spoof and the relationship between the Boss (Alec Baldwin) and his sidekick Lonny (Russel Brand) who were completely comfortable with their masculinity, bravo! The camera movement gave me a headache and thought it was a pity because there was so much going on in the scene that I couldn't really enjoy. In which case I would say that the sets were excessive in that you couldn't really feast our eyes on because the camera was moving too much.Songs bring nostalgia to the almost bygone era.

So on the surface, this movie has all the key elements for a good fun flick.Where the movie fails is the choice of Julianne Hough in the lead, who from the first time she opens her mouth to the end of the movie, kills every song she screeches-out. Her voice sounds like nails being dragged across a chalkboard! I cannot believe with all the talent in Hollywood and with all the young ladies that have been on ""American Idol"" that instead of giving one of them a shot at this role (which by the way, would make the movie more exciting and more ""real"" if they used an unknown or former ""idol"" performer), the producers actually listened to Julianne's shrilling and said ""Hmmmm.... let's cast her!"" instead of another young lady that actually can sing. It's so bad that I have to turn the TV down when she ""sings"" (shrills, actually) to keep my eardrums from shattering, my spine from shivering, and destroying my 300 watt speakers.Julianne Hough may be decent eye-candy, but she can't act and certainly cannot sing.

That by far is the only plus side I can give to this show. I think the biggest flaw of this show is the MAGOR CRAP plot.

I didn't know that this was a musical production going Hollywood to start with, but in the Netherlands it was sold as a fun portrait of the 80's rock scene.Well... though the songs reminded of that time, I was looking for the rock-part until the end of the movie. Every time an actor belts out a hit, you're reminded that the original, however cheesy, was better, rockier or more honest presented. Though the actors are not bad singers, it's way too clean, sweet, boyband-isch or pop-ish to be considered rock at all.It reminds me of all the great fairy tales, that have been polished to something entirely different by Disney. Rock of ages also feels like it had a treatment in the censorship washing machine.I am all for a good happy ending and also musicals are a bunch of fun, but if you try to portray a certain subculture you have to be careful to do it right. I am living and breathing Rock, though I am open towards other styles and views, but this movie feels like someone took my (metaphorical) balls, painted them pink and threw them in the blender.And this is not only because of the music. The story-line was as hair raising as the washed out shadows of the great 80 hits. The makers explored side story just to have in every minority group possible, every lonely side character needed a partner and really EVERYBODY had to get the happy-ever-after option and didn't spend enough attention to detail for the main story.Though Cruise made for a good Axel Rose sort of Rock good, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Rock of Ages

Catherine Zeta-Jones and Bryan Cranston as ""upright"" citizens with murkey pasts who want to rid the city of bad influences.

212,kefinka,A bit disappointing :(,6,22 July 2012,"I believe there are 2 types of people - those who love musicals and those who hate them. I belong to the first category. I enjoy musicals for the same reason as comic book based movies - they're not very deep and don't exactly scream Oscar but it's usually great relax and sheer fun. However, I was quite disappointed. Maybe it's because I was looking forward to this one for too long or (more likely) because I've seen it on West End last week and boy, it's a big difference! The musical is one of the tackiest things I have ever seen but it's irresistibly charming. It's ridiculously funny and brilliantly dynamic. There's not a lot of talking but the numbers are fantastic and they let you in on everything you need to know. Also, the cast is unbelievable. The whole thing makes you laugh like crazy, jump up and sing along until the very end.The movie version is not a complete waste of time BUT there's a lot of blind spots, the scenes are not properly connected. The jokes are very rare and sort of obvious, I'm sure there is more clever way to do a script. My biggest issue with the movie though was the alternative ending. One of the reasons I like this musical is that although there is a happy ending, it's a little more realistic one that you'd expect. In the movie they pulled on of the most nauseatingly American corny climaxes of all time and that just pushed the whole thing over the top. If I sum it up, it's an enjoyable summer flick but not something I would want to see again. What a shame...",Rock of Ages
213,joekool1000,A good time ... and nothing else,8,1 July 2012,"As a child of the '80s and as a teenager who wanted to hit the Sunset Strip and become a rock star (but my parents wouldn't let me), I eagerly anticipated the release of Rock of Ages. I saw the Tony Award nominated musical on Broadway, and was impressed with the seamless way classic rock anthems were worked into a true hair metal storyline as traditional stage rules were forsaken (for instance, breaking the fourth wall) for comedic purposes. After reading several critic and user reviews mostly bashing the movie, recognizing that musicals transformed on screen are typically disappointing, and watching box offices tallies certify Rock of Ages as a bomb, I had low expectations going into the movie. Perhaps it's because of these low expectations that I actually enjoyed Rock of Ages.You will know if you will enjoy Rock of Ages at the opening sequence as Dancing With The Stars alum Julianna Hough -- playing Sherrie Christian, an aspiring singer from Oklahoma who hits Hollywood seeking fame -- breaks out into Sister Christian on the bus ride to Los Angeles as fellow passengers sing backup. Just like the music and style from the era, this scene is pure cheese, as is the rest of the movie. If the first five minutes are too cheesy to you, then you will not enjoy the rest of the movie. However, if you can accept the garish nature of the scene and find yourself internally singing along, then you'll likely enjoy the flick.The story follows Christian and fellow aspiring singer Drew Boley (played by newcomer Diego Boneta) as they chase their rock and roll dreams while working at the fictionally legendary Bourbon Room club on the famed Sunset Strip. Meanwhile, the club, owned by Dennis Dupree and managed by Lonny (comic relief roles played by Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand, respectively), is under attack by the mayor and his wife (played by Bryan Cranston and and Catherine Zeta-Jones) in an attempt to clean up the strip and save children from the evils of rock music. At the center of their spite is mega-rock star diva Stacey Jaxx, played flawlessly by Tom Cruise.The movie takes some liberties with the musical's storyline, but for the most part is a fair representation. The introduction of Zeta-Jones' character as the mayor's wife was the biggest deviation from the musical, rendering Cranston's mayoral character useless in the movie. For the most part, the star-studded cast pulls off solid and humorous performances, especially Tom Cruise as the bigger-than-life rock god. Baldwin and Brand form a humorous team in their ridiculous outfits. And Paul Giametti and Mary J. Blige play their roles as a sleazy rock manager and strip club owner surprisingly well. The major disappointment was Zeta-Jones, who is ridiculously over-the-top even in a movie where everything is big.The music is phenomenal -- but only if you enjoy songs from the hair metal/arena rock era. It was surprising to see the actors, mostly not known for their singing, pull off strong performances of 80s rock anthems, particularly Cruise's rendition of Bon Jovi's ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and Def Leppard's ""Pour Some Sugar On Me,"" Baldwin and Brand's humorous duet of REO Speedwagon's ""I Can't Fight This Feeling,"" and the many duets by Boneta and Hough, such as a heartfelt mash-up of Extreme's ""More Than Words"" and Warrant's ""Heaven."" And the most of the cast joins in on performances of Poison's ""Nothing But A Good Time"" and Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing.""The Bourbon Room is introduced in an ensemble performance of Poison's ""Nothing But A Good Time."" Featuring big rock, big hair and a big cast, for those who are fans of this era of excess, Rock of Ages is indeed a good time, but nothing else.",Rock of Ages

Tom cruise did a great job playing the roll of Stacee Jaxx and the other characters also did an excellent job. I loved the costumes that Sherrie was wearing especially the dress at the start of the film. I think that the costume designer did a beautiful job and it looked like the 80's to me. The music was really good and I wanted to jump out of my seat to start singing and dancing. I suggest that you see this movie because it was spectacular.

The soundtrack to this movie if it has the originals, would be the best 80's greatest hits album ever for rock. The songs were great and they did some mash ups as well which worked. But the star of the movie is Tom Cruise. I knew he was a great actor, but he never has played a role like this(some would say his true personality is that of stacy jaxxx). Cruise shined here and although he may never receive an Oscar during a year in which he makes a film, he will no doubt get a lifetime achievement award.

216,asn-no,Do not let your children watch this unsupervised!,4,25 August 2015,"""Pop of Ages"" had been a more appropriate title for this movie. The closest thing to a rock song you'll hear, is some 80's glam rock ballad, rewritten to appeal to the lowest musical denominator. The story, is a classical boy meets girl, with a splash of cultural clash story (not dissimilar to Grease), in the form of a musical, but where great musicals use the songs to advance the story, Rock of Ages uses them to gloss over the holes in the storyline.The casting is horrible. Take for instance Tom Cruise as the lead rock and roll protagonist. Maybe someone saw him in the end of Tropic Thunder, dancing and rapping and thought, he will make a great singer. Alec Baldwin, has been cast, as an ageing club owner and rock institution. Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin are both great actors, with many memorial movies to their name. Unfortunately the have as much rock and roll between them as a 90's boyband.So if you do let your children watch this movie, make sure you take them on a tour of youtube and show them some real rock and roll, lest they think that the music they have heard is rock and roll.",Rock of Ages

Rock of Ages is an homage to this unique time in history, and it was surprisingly good.I have to admit I was skeptical when I first saw the trailers but my girlfriend convinced me to go see it (and she paid for dinner; I can't pass that up). We went to the Alamo Draft House and it is easy to say that we were the youngest people in the crowd. In fact, sitting right beside us were some slightly buzzed real house wives of Austin. I guess they were trying to relive their younger days.Rock of Ages has a few different stories going on at once but the main focus is on a stage-frightened barback and a sweet girl girl from Oklahoma, both wanting to fulfill their dreams of becoming famous musicians. Along the way, the two encounter an interesting array of character which I will list off now.-The bar owner who can't stop living in the past-The bar owners right hand man who is young niave and will follow the bar owner to the ends of the earth-A cheating politician-The cheating politicians wife who is obsessed with closing down the club and cleaning the streets-A sleazy music producer/manager-A hard hitting reporterand-The diva rock star played by Tom CruiseTom Cruise was great. He played the stereotypical rock-star doped up on alcohol and surround by honnies. My opinion is that we, the public, my think he takes himself too seriously but judging by his roles in Tropic Thunder and now Rock of Ages, Mr. Cruise does have a sense of humor. Although, I'm not sure Katie would approve of the ass- less chaps, or maybe their into that sort of thing. Anyway, at one point in my life I have to say I was a Tom Cruise hater but now I have seen the light.The two best parts of this film were the dance sequences and the music. I don't want to use this as a comparison because I think the show has gone downhill, but the mash-ups were reminiscent of Glee. The music along with the overly cheesy dance routines had the audience at my theater quietly singing along.Another thing that surprised me was Russel Brand. Many people not that I am not a fan of his at all but he was so funny in this film. I guess I like him more when he doesn't write his own comedy.If you are a guy and musicals aren't your forte, but your significant other insists on seeing one at least once a year, connivence your lady friend or boy friend (we don't judge here) to go see this film.8.0 out of 10""I' a stripper at the Venus Club.I'm in a boy band.You win.""",Rock of Ages
218,Balzer13,Thoroughly Charming,8,22 June 2012,"Not quite sure why this movie has been destroyed so much. It's super enjoyable fun from start to finish. It takes 80's rock anthems and breathes new life into them with super imaginatively choreographed dance sequences. My teen daughters are on their 3rd or 4th viewing. I've lost track. Very well cast; the female lead, Julianne Hough, is quite the find and has that rare movie star X factor and lights up the screen every time she's on. The story is light and fluffy for sure but is very well told for what it is. It reaches its goal of being high energy fun in spades. The screenwriters balance several story lines in a very satisfying way. And then there is Tom Cruise. He kills it as the washed up, dissolutioned rocker like he did the Les Grossman character in Tropic Thunder. And he can actually sing. It's kind of like the guilty pleasure people felt watching Mama Mia but with ratty 80's hair.",Rock of Ages
219,karen_ga,Sublime satire of 80's LA Rock Scene,7,29 October 2012,"This is everyone's basic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again, all dropped into the hair-metal bar band Sunset Strip Hollywood scene. What makes it different is the music. Who knew Tom Cruise could sing? Not that he's ready to start his own band, but his probably-not-SO-over-the-top performance he adds the perfect amount of sleaze to the role, while the script makes it clear that it all started out because a girl broke his heart. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the perfect Tipper Gore archetype. You can see where this movie is headed almost from the opening credits, and I really had my doubts, but in the end, I enjoyed it overall. Don't watch this movie if you're looking for profound meaning, but DO watch it if you loved the music of that time, and still listen to it when it comes on the radio.",Rock of Ages
220,mmainero,Fun Comedy,9,14 September 2013,"This is a comedy. Give it some time for the set up and then enjoy the cheesy take on all the fun 80s songs. All the actors give great performances, committing to character and script with the right amount of melodrama for the perfect comic touch. The story is predictable, true, but it's merely a vehicle for the gags and the music. I wish I'd known about this movie sooner (known that it was so much fun, can't trust the critics I guess) Just remember, this is a Comedy, don't take it too seriously, give in and enjoy the old song. The singing is actually halfway decent, if you are not overly critical. Tom Cruise is not ""star"" so much as just one of the cast, but his performance is good, and he don't look half bad with the lighting. Oh, and if you enjoyed any 80's comedies, you should like this!",Rock of Ages
221,insane-romantic,"Okay, but doesn't compare to the stage version",5,18 June 2012,"I went to see the live stage version of Rock of Ages in London a few weeks ago, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Naturally, I was interested to see how the musical would translate into a movie but I have to say I was rather disappointed. Some of the lead characters were very flat and boring, which I did not find to be the case in the stage version. Furthermore, the plot was changed to an unnecessary extent. Obviously, some changes have to be made for the plot to come across on-screen, but I felt many changes were unnecessary and made the plot rather one-dimensional.I wasn't expecting to like Tom Cruise in this movie, but I was actually impressed by how well he pulled off the character of Stacee Jaxx, and his singing voice was also surprisingly good! The movie added more dimension to his character (strange, since they ruined many of the other characters!) which was interesting. However, I do feel that giving so much screen- time to the character of Stacee, who features a lot less in the stage version, was to the detriment of the rest of the movie, as it allowed less time for other characters and plot-lines to develop. Presumably, the reason for the amount of Stacee screen-time was because Tom Cruise was the biggest name in the film.The two main protagonists of the story – Sherrie and Drew – were poorly portrayed, in my opinion. The actor playing Drew was far too clean-cut, fresh-faced and cheesy to be convincing as an aspiring rock star. I actually felt he was more suited to being in the Z Guyeezz! Furthermore, the ""love story"" between these two characters was made incredibly boring and predictable.I very much enjoyed the performance of Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as Dennis and Lonnie. Although I was expecting Lonnie to have a smaller part in the film, compared to the stage version, I was disappointed that these two were given so little screen time. This also meant that the scene where they confess their feelings for each other seem forced. Also, I was rather confused by Russell Brand's accent, which became strangely Liverpudlian about half-way through! Catherine Zeta-Jones'character worked reasonably well as a composite of two very different characters from the stage version. However, the financial method of closing the Bourbon Rooms were less interesting than the methods in the stage version, in which protesters for rock and roll try to persuade people to keep it open.For me, the main problem was the large plot changes which made the whole story much more basic, being reduced to ""Bourbon rooms needs money, hires Stacee Jaxx to get money, his manager takes the money and it's later returned"" along with a few unfounded relationships cropping up here and there. I feel the stage version was a lot more than this, and the movie didn't do it justice. One of the worst changes, for me, was giving Stacee Jaxx a happy ending. Throughout the stage version, he was a thoroughly unlikeable character. However, in the movie, they made him more likable and gave him a romantic storyline as well. Movies seem to be incapable to deal with a main character not having a happy ending.As this is a jukebox musical movie, it is of course necessary to mention the musical numbers. On the whole, I enjoyed them a lot, although I felt that Drew 'writing' Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" went a bit too far! In particular I enjoyed Mary J Blige singing ""Anyway You Want It"" and Cruise's rendition of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"".Overall, I thought the movie was okay. It had a few laughs, but not enough, and some decent musical numbers. However, I feel that changing the storyline so much was a mistake, as was the lack of any character development (with the exception of Stacee, who had character development in spades!). I enjoyed the film, but feel that it doesn't do justice to the stage version, which I heartily recommend.",Rock of Ages

I was against doing so, but she seemed like she really wanted to go, and thus our date night began.I hadn't seen the ""hit"" Broadway musical, and had not heard of the two leads before seeing this movie. So you could say, that I walked in with an open mind.All I can say after seeing this film is, ""Wow."" And not in a good way. The only redeeming factor of this film is Tom Cruise, who as always put his all into every role he's in. He becomes the rock god Stacee Jaxx, and makes a very convincing character. And boy, can he sing.Everything else in the movie is complete garbage. The musical covers all sound the same, and are pointlessly integrated to what the film makers call a story. The story itself is bland, obnoxious, and pointless. None of the characters except Cruise are likable, and the two leads sound like they can only sing songs for American Idol, and both fail at acting.The movie also drags on and on. Slow pacing to a film can be good, but when the movie is as uninteresting as Rock of Ages, you feel like leaving the theater early.Throw on top of the plot an awful love story, and you have an ugly cherry finishing off this disaster of a sundae.Don't see it unless you like fake rock n' roll music.

I wasn't expecting anything particularly masterful mind you but what I got was truly an exercise in every aspect of bad movie making. On a technical level the film's direction is sloppy and Adam Shankman seems to lose all control of the proceedings from the get go. The tone is constantly off kilter....is this a sendup? An affectionate retro musical? It's neither since no one here is committed to a clear idea of what the hell this claptrap is supposed to be. The two young leads may offer some appeal but they are ultimately as dull and generic as the tedious boy-meets-girl- from-a-small-town-who-comes-to-the-big-city-with-a-dream plot line. Tom Cruise tries his hand at the washed up rock star routine but his performance is cringe inducing and borderline embarrassing. Catherine Zeta Jones is also shockingly bad in a bizarre, over the top caricature as the puritan politician's wife trying to fight against the sins of rock and roll. The usually reliable Mrs Douglas disappoints here. Alec Baldwin, Russel Brand and the rest of the cast ham it up annoyingly throughout. Much has been said about enjoying the music instead of the silly antics but I was unable to even do that since the once enjoyable 80's hair metal songs are butchered here and walled up in set pieces which are consitantly stupid and painfully unfunny. This is one of those rare atrocities which only excels at one thing... it surpasses Mamma Mia as the worst screen musical in recent memory.",Rock of Ages

Def leppard and motley crue like bands: they were no rock idol.The movie wanted to show that rock n roll is all about sex. Tom Cruise portrayed a retard rock star who is sleeping with tens and hundreds of 17 years old and singing like something is shoved in his exit. And also I did not get the point of him taking off his shirt all the time and bending backwards while singing as if he is suffering from constipation.What I felt watching this movie (could only watch till the half of it), can't be expressed within the constraint of 'using decent words'. The summary is if I could I would have taken lawsuits against all the cast and crew of this movie.I am a proud metal-head and an artist as well. The world never got us right and never will.

228,benfield-larry09,Blast from the Past,8,8 April 2013,This is my first review. OK let's start up front and say this film is predictable. Boy meets girl and sparks fly but it is set to a fantastic soundtrack that marks the height of the 80's rock era. Although not a big musical fan this movie was very entertaining and surprisingly Tom Cruise comes off quite well as Stacee Jaxx( Axel Rose/Bon Jovi). The Sherri and Drew story arc is not as strong as it should be but the Stacee and Constance plot is a hoot through most of the film.If you are looking for a serious film don't watch this because it takes nothing serious which is why the film works so well. Those who grew up in the era(myself included) will love the selection of songs if you are a fan of the hair-band music. The actors do well but not perfect at singing the classic songs. Alec Baldwin is funny and the supporting cast was solid. If you want to take a trip down the 80's rock era lane give this film a try and you will likely be washed in the nostalgia of a fantastic era of music.,Rock of Ages
229,wweed-1,"If you liked ""Mamma Mia"" or ""Glee"", go see this. (Very minor spoilers)",7,12 June 2012,"Usually I steer clear of IMDb reviews, because it can quickly become a battleground, but after the horrible abuse that John Carter suffered (a good film beat up before it had a chance) I can see ""Rock of Ages"" as a possible critical target and felt I needed to jump in.As a 48 year old, the film represents some of the rock that I lived through in the 80's, and that's almost always fun. The music has an overly polished, edited-down feeling like Glee sometimes has, but you have to smile when everyone on the bus to LA starts singing ""Sister Christian"". You're either into musicals or you're not, and if that opening scene doesn't make you smile, it's not your kind of film.I understand that the film has been cleaned up from the stage version, but it still has some sex and innuendo. Tom Cruise examining the inside of Malin Ackerman's thighs while singing ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" made me laugh out loud, and it was steamy.I felt the two young leads were lacking in charisma, and for a ""Dancing with the Stars"" champ, Julianne Hough didn't get to dance much, but she is really nice to look at - like a teen Jennifer Aniston. I also felt that their vocals couldn't hold up to the more mature performers, even Tom Cruise.Speaking of Cruise, love him or hate him, he walks away with this movie. I'm talking Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom, possibly. There's still a bit of that Tom swagger in there, but he becomes Stacee Jaxx. He is not worried about his image beyond looking and sounding like a burned-out rocker, and he's really good because of that.My few quibbles aside, it's just fun, fun, fun. If you don't like any of the recent musicals and Rogers and Hammerstein were never your thing, this isn't for you. But if you do, don't listen to the critics. You will enjoy this film.P.S.

The problem here, is that this plot-point has such a rare presence in the movie. It appears at the beginning of the film, and at the end, and when it does, it holds no effect on the overall story, and it's poorly conceived. It just wastes the screen time. -Scenes between the songs are GUT-WRENCHINGLY painful. The dialogue is so immature, and the story never goes anywhere. -Lip-syncing can be hilariously obvious at times. -The movie tries to be funny, but instead of laughing at the dumb jokes, you'll be laughing at the general awkwardness of their choice of moments for the musical numbers.Final verdict: Rock of Ages is a generic attempt at combing hardcore music and a love story together, however it is poorly conceived that you would be much better of buying the albums that these songs came in, and get something enjoyable (which you might as well do, because the score is overt plagiarism).

And it was a lot more fun being there in person in the 80s than sitting through this movie. First of all, there were filming glitches. In a couple of places including the bus station early in the movie there were things on screen that would not have existed in the 80s. That threw me off right away because the attention to detail of the era was lacking. But on to the acting and the music. The only real shining star of the movie was Tom Cruise. And I don't even like him. But he was fun to watch. Everyone else seemed air brushed and auto tuned. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin were also decent. But the entire movie just didn't seem 80s enough to me. I'll put it this way. During the first hour I was debating walking out. The second hour I was checking my watch. I made it through but wish I had been more into it. On another note, what was 80s about the strip club? The outfits, the interior....nothing said 80s to me.

""Rock of Ages (ROA)"" is not a satire of the 80s as other reviewer opined; a satire is: ""The use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices [];"" IMHO, ROA is more a celebration of the zeitgeist of the 1980's/LA metal scene. The movie ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a satire, the real life band ""Steel Panther"" is satire, but ROA is not.The songs used were good choices and they worked. The main songs are done as a medley-- -think: Will To Power's ""Baby I Love Your Way/Freebird,"" but there are snippets of individual songs throughout the film.The film does have its cheesy moments, but for the most part they are a way to launch into a musical number or a bad attempt at humor.

The fact that it's a musical will turn some people off, but I happen to like musicals. HOWEVER, even if you don't typically like musicals, if you love 80's music, you may still enjoy this one very much. All the good solid hits are in this film and the campy, silly plot just hits home with us ""80's babies"". Sherrie is played by Julianne Hough and I am convinced nobody would have fit the bill better! Tom Cruise was perfect in his role, and I couldn't call myself a fan except maybe now... This film took me back to the 80's era movies where the guy gets his girl with silliness in the mix. Yes, the plot was fairly predictable, but that's what made it fun for me. I didn't have to over-think this one, it was just fun! I like a smart film, but in its own way, this film is very smart because it takes all the nostalgic 80's era movie moments and subtly duplicates the ""feel"" of that time. And one song after enough, it reeled me in and kept me smiling throughout. With the cast, you can't go wrong, in my opinion, and everybody hit their mark. I would say go see it if you would like a trip down memory lane.",Rock of Ages

I loved the cast so it was worth it to see people on the big screen that I have watched for years all come together.The movie does start a bit slow. I wondered what I was doing watching this movie for the first 20 minutes after that I was immediately in love! Tom Cruise is an amazing actor. Maybe one of his best roles yet. You forget you are watching Tom. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Alec Baldwin really brought flavor to the whole production. I laugh and was shocked a few time. It was a thrilling adventure. The acting was phenomenal and I want to see it a second time. Definitely going back to the theaters to see this again. It's a must see!! The costumes and the movies rocked in the movie. I can't say enough good things about the film. It's not a movie I will forget easily. I left happy and smiling and recalling lines. A new classic.",Rock of Ages

He always had a Journey or Bon Jovi CD in the car and I loved every second of it. I went to see this film with relatively high expectations and it didn't disappoint.Naturally, Tom Cruise steals the film. He is sensational as rock god Stacee Jaxx and provides many laughs. He and Malin Akerman who plays Constance Sack are fantastic together and I would be delighted to see these two actors reunited in a future film. Sadly, the two protagonists played by Julianne Hough and Diego Bonita lack that same chemistry which is why I've given it a rating of 8/10 instead of 9 or 10/10. Julianne Hough also possesses one of the most irritating singing voices I've ever had the misfortune to hear. Happily, she's rather attractive which makes up for it a bit. Paul Giamatti does a great job as a dodgy agent and Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are magnificent together.The songs are brilliant and I had an urge to sing along every time one came on. The writers clearly haven't tried to force the songs into the script and the whole thing flows nicely.Overall, this is a great film and one I would recommend to anyone who loves this type of music and wants to be entertained thoroughly.",Rock of Ages
253,awkwardmatt,Horrible piece of cinematic poop but I loved the song choices,4,5 July 2012,"Warning: this review contains spoilers which should not be a surprise to anyone.This mess of a flick has come about in this current craze for musicals, which I refuse to be a part of (evidence to the contrary will be eliminated). Relative unknowns Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough headline this film with stars Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Mary J Blige, Catherine Zeta Jones, Malin Akerman and more dancing, singing, drinking, awkwardly licking each others faces and terrible 80's hair-styling around them.Sherrie Christian (Julianne Hough) is just a small town girl, living in a lonely world who took a midnight train going anywhere while Drew Boley (Diego Boneta) is just a city boy  you get the idea. They're young, they're attractive and they're talented singers with ambition but are overlooked. Sound familiar? They meet, they fall in love, they fight and sing and dance their way through it all. Fans of the 70's and 80's will at least enjoy the music and jokes thrown in at the expense of that era and the change of the music scene. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand provide ""comic relief"" as the two drunken bar-owners/workers who have a torrid love affair to REO Speedwagon's ""Can't Fight This Feeling"".The one saving grace to this film, and it pains me to say this, is Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx. An out of control, drunken rock star seemingly on his way out. He brought the most interesting moments and insights into his character and his chemistry and interaction with Constance Sack (Malin Akerman) was amusing to watch. Sadly his character wasn't in the film as much as he could have been. I think Stacee Jaxx as the main character and storyline would have been more intriguing and enjoyable than the plain young songbirds trying to make it big in a big city. Whenever the other stars are around, especially Cruise, you tend to forget about these two underdogs.",Rock of Ages

I'm no prude, and like good, healthy movie sex when it is erotic and not exploitive. Because no nudity is present they were probably able to keep the PG13. However, I would like to remind the producers that actors who put their heads between other actors legs, and gyrate on poles with panning in and out crotch shots, this doesn't make the film PG13, even with their clothes on. The sex is gratuitous and exploitive, and not suitable for teenagers. Now to the story: Not worth re-capping the fine points because there aren't any. I don't know how Tom Cruise, who is now 50 years old, could make this film without being embarrassed. Did he convince himself that he was having a good time? His acting abilities have always been suspect, but now he's crossed the line into ludicrous. The only positive I can find, with a very large magnifying glass is Alec Baldwin as the club owner. The music is badly done, with duets sung by people in different parts of the set, and superimposed. Yuk.

Spot on: either you get this film or you don't, period. Go read that review-- after you read mine! ...My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! We went in with moderated expectations and found it tremendously funny and well-acted, especially by the veterans in the cast. Tom Cruise's overly-medicated, egotistical, dark-eyed head case rocker was a complete surprise. From our very first glimpse of his, uh, lower torso being revealed underneath a pile of writhing female bodies, you know this guy's gonna be fun to watch. Alec Baldwin was perfectly cast as an old-soul performance bar owner with Russell Brand as his show emcee and business partner; they make such a nice couple. Malin Ackerman underplays her Rolling Stone reporter role until she gets to be alone with Cruise's rocker, with wild and comic results. And Paul Giamatti nails the slimy-slick manager and gets off some of the better lines: ""I can't wait to read the article!"" But the scene stealer is Catherine Zeta-Jones playing it way over the top, channeling Tipper Gore through a ""Chicago"" style bombast.Sure, the plot was a little thin and predictable. And I can see how some feel like the two youngest cast members were the weakest players. But all the subplots woven equally into the musical fabric took just the right twists and turns to aim them toward the ""inevitable"" conclusion.And what music! I never cared for much of the puffed-hair, glammed-up, coliseum- sized anthem rock from the '80s, even after doing six years of album rock radio deejaying in the '70s. But seeing characters in the situations of the lyrics adds greater appreciation for any song. Isn't that what musicals are all about?This is a great summertime diversion for adult audiences and lovers of '80s style anthem rock, looking for a bit of nostalgia but even more-- looking for laughs. Ignore the naysayers! ""Rock of Ages"" is a solid 7 out of 10.",Rock of Ages
262,springstone,"Brilliant, finally a musical worth watching",10,9 November 2012,"I feel compelled to submit a review for this movie, purely because some of the atrocious reviews I've seen contributed by others.To give context, I grew up in the 80s and 90s, and pretty much know all the songs backwards - surprisingly... decades later. I did not grow up in LA, or the States for that matter, but I most certainly grew up with just about every song played in this movie.I absolutely hate musicals. With a passion. So, even though my friends encouraged me to watch this movie, I resisted. Eventually I caved, and all I can say is that I absolutely loved the movie! My wife loved the movie, but in all honesty, our 10 year old thought it was OK - purely because she didn't know any of the songs.If you love rock, and grew up with 80s rock, this movie is for you. This movie isn't called Rap of Ages or Pop of Ages or R&B of Ages or Classical Music for the Ages... it's called Rock of Ages. Reviewers posting they walked out after 15 minutes, really shouldn't contribute here. And quite frankly, you need to have a serious problem if you are analyzing the actors voices with respect to the original artists. This movie is good fun, and true to the times... This movie is THE musical for all rockers out there! Absolutely wonderful fun for the family, with a stellar performance from the entire cast. A good couple of chuckles in there, and if you're over 35 years old... I dare you to not sing along with some of those classics. With so much rubbish coming out of Hollywood to keep the nay-sayers busy with their critical reviews, this is a refreshing change.If rock is not your choice of music, skip this movie... but if you grew up in the 80s, you should appreciate the music, fun and experience portrayed in this movie.This movie rocked!",Rock of Ages
263,nlw820,Total fun from start to finish,9,17 June 2012,"In reading some of the negative reviews here, I almost feel like people went in to this film taking it far too seriously. Having not seen the stage show, I can't compare, but as a campy 80s musical, it delivered far more than I expected.The two young people playing the lead roles aren't brilliant in their performances--but they don't have to be. Neither is storyline that strong. Again, it doesn't have to be. The music is the star here (okay, maybe only second to Tom Cruise, but still...). This is just a fun romp of a movie for anyone who is the least bit familiar with the music of the era. It's a film you can just escape into and laugh at the silliness of it all. The musical performances are all pretty terrific and the comedy so over the top that the people in attendance were laughing so hysterically at times that you'd miss the next line. Finally, Tom Cruise delivers in a way that can surprise even the most jaded movie-goer. His voice & screen presence really do make the film. I realize that there probably was a bit of studio magic happening, but it is still damned impressive. There are a few details that can one can nit-pick about if they wish (yes, Skid Row wouldn't have been playing over the speakers in Tower Records in 1987, and Sherrie's hair looks a little more 1977 than 1987), but none of it really takes away from the pure enjoyment of the film. I'm giving this 9 stars because it delivers exactly what it should. Bonus: look for actual 80s rockers in the crowd outside the bar during ""We Built This City."" :)",Rock of Ages

I loved the music and the story. Tom Cruise was just awesome! Man can he sing! Who knew? Looked damn good too! He was riveting. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand were a lot of fun. I gave it a 10. Oh, and my husband who isn't really hot on musicals liked it a lot too.And my sister-in-laws review: Although I've rated this fairly high, note that I feel it's probably more of a girl's movie than guy's. It started off slow enough that I kept checking my watch. I really wasn't too crazy about the music selection either -- most of the songs were hair metal blah. However, through the mediocrity, Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand gave me a chuckle here and there. They made the movie watchable until Stacee Jax showed up.Why do I give it so many stars, you ask?Well... I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan-girl. I mean, I like him just fine, but I don't stalk IMDb looking for his next movie or anything like that. Stacee Jax on the other hand... OMG!! Stacee lit up the screen, rocked it and took over the movie. I was absolutely riveted. He sang great too!! And the ending was so good and so perfect that you left the theater feeling like the world was a happy place. Seriously, Tom Cruise WAS Stacee Jax, every naughty inch of him. Sooooo good!

Being a kid who grew up in the 80's with this music and the long hair on guys, it brings back a lot of good memories and it's just a fun movie to watch. Being a huge Def Leppard fan, it was great to see and hear their songs in the movie. It may not be a normal musical that most people would expect, like Mary Poppins or the Sound of Music, but it is a great musical. On a side note, I did buy the whole album on iTunes and was disappointed because the songs were not as good as they were in the movie.

268,adams79,Never loved and hated a movie at the same time before...,4,18 June 2012,"I have to admit, I am a fan of Adam Shankman. I watch SYTYCD and I love that he is a positive and influential person to all of the performers.However, I'm not a big fan of his directorial career. Hairspray and his latest disaster, Rock of Ages, have not been the greatest efforts in the musical genre.The movie is a parody of the rock industry. Throw in an aspiring Rock star and a ""young southern bell comes to the big city"" motif, and you've got a recipe for a truly terrible and overused plot line. Most of the points were spot on about the school of hard knocks and corporate intervention (and ultimate ruination) of rock'n roll. But, from a storytelling perspective, the execution was just... lame. And let's face it, Rock'n Roll is NOT supposed to be lame.As a matter of fact, and forgive me for being philosophical, I feel like the overall idea of this movie is a slap in the face to all that Rock'n Roll stands for. Rock has no business in pop culture.. it's supposed to make people angry. It's not supposed to yield legions of young teenage girls walking out of a movie theater saying ""that was cute"".The movie seems completely bipolar. Just when I was being lulled into great music, something truly truly awful would happen. I was often left thinking ""ummm... what was that?"" I give the film 4/10 only because Tom Cruise hit the nail on the head with his performance. And he truly did not have much to work with. Julianne Hough gave a good effort, but she needs to continue working on her acting chops. Alec Baldwin needs to think twice before singing in public ever again. Russel Brand was good, but he didn't do anything that we haven't seen from him before. Catherine Zeta Jones' character was laughable. The lead guy was so unmemorable that I literally have been scrolling around this page for his name and I can't find it (Diego something? ... I stopped looking). Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite actors of the past 10 or 15 years. So, I can't say anything bad about him... other than WHY DID YOU SIGN UP FOR THIS?? If you're thinking about seeing this movie, I'd probably wait until it comes out on DVD/Blu Ray. It's not worth 20 or 30 bucks to see on the big screen.

Tom Cruise trying to be the 'sexy rock god' was a little disturbing because in his best moments during the movie he looked like Lestat in 'Interview with a Vampire' when he was supposed to be dying. Also, the lead actor and actress have absolutely no chemistry. Alec Baldwin was surprisingly decent as the owner of the legendary rock bar. Catherine Zeta Jones was another con to this movie- I understood the role she was attempting to pull off, but it was poorly executed. The movie had interesting aspects but the bad out-weighed the good. If you're a fan of musicals and 1980's rock it's definitely worth watching once. However.

270,ryanapearce,Rock Of Ages Doesn't Impress,5,12 June 2012,"Being a fan of Adam Shankman's Hairspray, I went in to the theater skeptical as to whether or not Rock Of Ages could be better. I wasn't impressed with the trailer and unfortunately the movie didn't impress me either. The storyline of the film was basically ""small girl from small town goes away to big city and falls in love with a guy "" and even though it stays true to the Broadway show, it just doesn't work for a movie.The acting was so-so, I thought the real stars of the film were Tom Cruise and his insane ""Stacee Jaxx"", Russell Brand and his hilarious jokes, and Paul Giamatti as Stacee's manager. The music numbers didn't cut it for me and at times I cringed as to how auto-tuned it sounded. The jokes in the film, were laugh-out-loud funny at times and kept me from completely dozing off. Keep an eye out for Stacee Jaxx's monkey. (He was a great addition.)Growing up in the 90′s, I never really caught on or even listen back to this time period and it's music. With that being said, however, I was impressed with the recreation of Los Angeles in 1987 and felt immersed into that time period.Rock Of Ages received a PG-13 rating and I felt that was pretty generous considering it was riddled with sexual dialog and dirty language. Overall I didn't come out of the theater loving it as much as Hairspray, but if you are a huge fan of the 80′s and don't mind constant auto-tune in every number then I recommend you see this film.-Ryan Pearce vambient.com",Rock of Ages

Tom Cruise is a great actor but was not made to do a movie like this. He is not the kind of actor that can play the role of a drug and alcohol consuming rock star. I would have preferred if another actor, for example Charlie Sheen, would have made this movie more enjoyable for my and my friend. My friend and I couldn't stand Julianne Hough's voice as it was very annoying and pitchy. Time passed very quickly and seemed as if Sherrie and Drew knew each other for a week when in reality they could have been dating for years. There was to much going on in the story to the point where I was very confused about what was going on in the movie. I was not sure what was really going on and what was the main focus of the story. The love story between Sherrie and Drew, much like the entire story of the movie. They knew each other for a day and they were already making out and in-love. Drew had written a song about Sherrie and played it at their first date. Seriously????? That isn't very realistic. Howener, there were good parts to this movie. some of the dialogue was somewhat funny and I did manage to laugh at some points.

The acting, while not phenomenal, was performed nicely. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta both played innocent kids in love pretty well, despite not having much apparent on-screen chemistry, Tom Cruise played, drunk with an attitude, Stacey Jaxx better than I expected, and Russel Brand along side Alec Baldwin were surprisingly entertaining as Lonny and Dennis (respectively), and were hilarious with their bromance. The script had no real surprises, many cheesy lines (which may only bother some) and overall seemed like it was very rushed.The music is the strong point of this movie. Everyone brings solid vocal performances to these 80s Rock songs, and to me was the only part of the movie that kept me paying attention.It's not an awful movie, but at the same time it's not a great movie.

276,ambra_atreides,Excellent!,10,21 January 2013,"This was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long long time! The music was good and perfectly fitted the script. The voices were really good, considering that apart from Mary J Blige, the others were professional actors not singers (a standing ovation to Tom Cruise therefore!) . Amazing acting from Tom Cruise; Catherine Zeta Jones was really intense and funny as well. The two main characters really had a spark going on. I enjoyed the duo Rusell Brand - Alec Baldwin. So funny :) What I really liked, is that it was a comedy and a little bit of a parody, but not too much to become ridiculous, and it never gave you that feeling that they were trying to make you laugh. Well, i""m not used to reviewing pretty much anything, so hope I can give you future viewers a general picture. 10 stars",Rock of Ages

She gets off the bus to a street scene of arrests, prostitutes and drug dealers. What does this pretty 'liddle' thing from Oklahoma do? Smiles. Credits end. She gets her bag stole but doesn't even get upset, this film proceeded to get worse.Russel Brand who's as English as Afternoon tea sounded like Dick Van Dyke from Mary Poppins.

278,redsoxjv13,seriously Mr Shankman?,1,15 June 2012,"This movie completely missed the mark. Adam Shankman took a fun, feel good Broadway musical and turned it into a overblown star studded fiasco. It is a COMPLETE sin, that Constantine Maroulis, who brilliantly played Drew on Broadway, was given a minuscule cameo role instead of being able to portray on the big screen the part that was the true heart and soul of the story. Seems like an obvious slap in the face to a talented performer who made the Broadway musical so successful. Also, what about the Germans? As anyone reading this review would know, I am not a fan of Adam Shankman. I, however, did hope that he would stay true to the story. It is my opinion that Mr Shankman took the story, gutted it & bedazzled it with big names - but it left me feeling empty.",Rock of Ages

280,jaymeelinellis,One of the best film adaptions of a musical I have seen in a long time.,10,26 September 2016,"If you haven't heard, this is a musical based on a stage play. If you don't know that going in, and don't enjoy musicals, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. Hence all of the poor reviews below.This movie is excellent. The casting is hilarious and well done - Catherine Zeta Jones portrays a ""god-loving Christian"" while simultaneously busting out Michael Jackson dance moves with a serious, snobby air. Julianne Hough absolutely shines as the young country girl heading for the big city to live out her dream of becoming a singer, showing off her singing and dancing prowess. Diego Boneta has come out of the woodwork after somewhat smaller roles (Pretty Little Liars, Mean Girls) and played the part with equal parts serious talent and corny acting (which is required as it is A MUSICAL based on a STAGE PRODUCTION. Sigh.) And my god does Tom Cruise play his part of drunken, crazy rocker to perfection. Not only does he show off his great voice, we also get to see what he'd look like with ridiculous tattoos planted all over his torso ;) Apart from the great casting and classic throwback rock songs, you get a silly but fun storyline (which changes from production to production - I've seen a version of the story where Sherrie does sleep with Stacee and the antagonists are a building company trying to turn the Strip into a mall) some great dancing, singing and costumes, and Alec Baldwin. Who doesn't love Alec Baldwin? I really don't get the negative reviews for this movie. If you don't like musicals, don't watch it. It's not necessary to bring down the rating of a fantastic live action production of a great musical just because you don't like the genre of film. 10/10, have watched about 20 times since it came out.",Rock of Ages

282,FuriousGeorge67,John Travolta can rest easy.,1,8 December 2020,"The mantle of the worst movie starring a Scientologist has been wrested from Battlefield: Earth. Battlefield::Earth is Oscar worthy compared to this.Stumbled across Rock of Ages on HBO Max and gave it a go. There is nothing enjoyable here. It's a waste of several actors I like (Brand, Cruise, Giamatti, Cranston), an exposure of several that are relatively overrated (Zeta-Jones and Baldwin) and a couple of inexplicable relatively unknown leads (Hough and Boneta). With that supporting cast these two are not really worthy of that kind of push.It's RfftTrax / MST3K bad. With the exception of Baldwin and Giamatti (who should never ever again even be recorded singing in the shower), the leads are the worst singers in a musical with arrangements that take the, already almost non--existent, edge from hair band music completely out. It's like the Glee went metal, but not that hardcore.The story is pretty much non existent (Yes even for a silly musical) and an excuse to go from one poorly conceived, and thankfully incomplete, karaoke version of 80's hair band staple to the next. The positive note here is that Cruise is actually bar band competent as a rock singer though Sebastian Bach need not lose sleep.Hard pass on a rewatch.",Rock of Ages

But that's OK because sometimes you just need a film that you can just relax and enjoy. I loved this film. I loved the music. Tom Cruise is wonderfully surprising as Stacey Jaxx, his singing is too bad either! Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand made me laugh out loud. Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough were also excellent. Catherine Zeta Jones does slightly crazy so well! And how had I forgotten how beautiful Mary J. Blige's voice is.

Apart from that, these clowns took great songs and put them in a horrible horrible versions that sucked all life and rock out of them. I understand the concept of Musicals and Comedies and I enjoy them, but this was just a rape of good tunes and devoid of humor. The production was professional and well done, but why did they turn these songs into these whiny overproduced crap. Such a disappointment! The movie would have been much better if the production team would have kept to the rock and roll sound and feel and not take it all the way to a completely different genre.

286,Badger1492,"Trite, Predictable, and silly",4,21 June 2012,"I'll be brief. I went to this movie expecting some light fun and a few laughs. The plot was so predictable and shallow (yeah, I know, it's a musical), but... There were a few funny lines, some very beautiful women, and then...the whole thing went right off the cliff when Dennis (Alec Baldwin) and Lonny(Russel Brand) fall in love and sing a duet. Sheesh! Talk about silly!Thinking back on it, the funniest parts were the baboon's; he made me laugh more than any of the other characters. Entertaining, but mostly a waste of time.In order to submit this review, I must write at least 10 lines. So, here's some more. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks like a stick figure. A very hot stick figure, I might add. Tom Cruise's Character is interesting, but pretty 2-dimensional. His drunken musings were taken as deep philosophy. Think of how interesting a film they could have made if they would have brought all that money and talent to bear on a script, story, and music that had something new to say.",Rock of Ages
287,sariforever,Not that bad! Rather pretty enjoyable.,7,3 October 2012,"I seriously do not get why some people have a problem with this movie. It is pretty entertaining if you ask me. Okay granted I am a sucker for musicals so if you're not into those.. this movie might not be for you.I can see that some complain about the fact that the songs in this movie turned out to be more pop than rock but since this is pretty typical for musicals I really wasn't expecting anything else. And lets be honest here... the original songs weren't exactly hard rock songs to begin with.The cast is pretty nice too. Tom Cruise is doing a great job here and let me tell you I'm not really a fan of his. I certainly dislike him for everything he stands for but when it comes to acting he's pretty spot on. You gotta give him credit for that. The two main characters aren't delivering Oscar worthy performances but in the end they do their job and kinda fit. Julianne Hough is a great dancer and she shows that once or twice here. Acting and singing wise... she's okay. So is Diego Boneta. Paul Giamatti, Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are there for a few good laughs and their performances are solid. Not really much to complain about in this department.Being born in the 80s I kinda grew up with most of the songs in this movie and I quite enjoyed the new rendition of them. I in fact listened to some of the old classics again and went down memory lane after I was done watching. Yes we all love our highly acclaimed rock bands but I won't apologize for enjoying some of the old 80s hits. As cheese as some might be they make most of us smile, sing and dance (and don't tell me you didn't like them. That'd probably be a lie ^^) So all in all I really liked this movie. It's no masterpiece but I don't think it wanted to be one anyway. It's just about music, enjoying yourself and simply wants to entertain. It does that.If you enjoy musicals or just want to see a lighthearted movie, go see it! It is fun and not nearly as bad as some make it out to be.Oh and by the way I do not like Glee. So whoever states this movie is only made for the Glee crowd. Not true!",Rock of Ages
288,muderousurgeent,The Music Deserved Better,3,21 June 2021,"This feels like someone heard about how big rock was in the 80s, the iconic LA Strip scene and tried to cash in, using some great songs. The story is bad and feels like something you'd see on the Lifetime channel, if it wasn't a musical. And sadly, the musical aspect doesn't help it. The songs just don't have the same energy, and lose their fun being used how they are. However, on a positive note, at least the acting, direction and cinematography was good!",Rock of Ages
289,jon_longworth,Rock is Ageless,8,15 June 2012,"I'm a child of the 70s and 80s. I love music. I love movies. So there was no-way, no how, I was not going to see Rock Of Ages. Naturally I was accompanied by the adolescent units JLO1 and JLO2 who are exactly the same as me but 35 years younger. Lucky them. We, all three of us, really dug the film man. None of us have seen the musical, so we couldn't compare and didn't have expectations.If I wanted to, there are plenty of things I could pick about this film. But at the end of the day you are either going to go with the flow or you can nitpick, compare and complain. I'm a flow guy myself. My time and money are precious so I don't want to force myself to have a bad time if I can help it. Unless its an Adam Sandler film. What I'm saying here is that I extended some grace towards Rock of Ages and it paid me back - with humour, energy, great songs and an upbeat vibe.In the opening scene - Cherrie (Julianne Hough) is a young Oklahoma singer leaving town for Hollywood seeking fame, excitement and love. Shes flicking through the records she's bought and starts singing and then of course the driver and the rest of the passengers join in. Fantastic, we're off to a great start here. Arriving in Hollywood surrounded by the bustle and bright lights she bursts out into ""Just Like Livin' in Paradise"" and we are well and truly on our way. Cherrie's love interest Drew (Diego Boneta) - also a singer - is working at The Bourbon Room as a bar tender.So to fast forward - the Mayor and his puritan wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) want to shut the Bourbon Room down. Its run by Dennis Dupree (Alec Baldwin) and his simple but charming cockney partner Lonny (Russel Brand). To stave off bankruptcy and fight the Mayor Dupree calls in a favour from Rock-God Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise). If he can get Stacee Jaxx to perform his last gig there he'll make enough money to save his club. Well Stacee Jaxx and his manager (Paul Giamatti) are not the most predictable of fellows and things become complicated.This is a skeletal story to hang some great songs on with plenty of jokes and over-the-top performances. Tom Cruise is mostly great, Paul Giamatti is always fantastic, Alec Baldwin is quite funny and Russel Brand so so. Catherine Zeta-Jones is incredible and for my money her performance of Pat Benatar's ""Hit me with Your Best Shot"" was a real highlight. Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta are good bordering on great.I hold the Blues Brothers dear as my all-time favourite musical and film. This is no Blues Brothers but nothing else is.I'll give it 7 stars out of 10 PS It has a monkey in it. Monkey's are always worth an extra star - so 8 out of 10 (see The Hangover 2) Enhanced by Zemanta jlo2000.com",Rock of Ages
290,peteragon,Cruise is the only shine of this movie.,10,16 June 2012,"Rock of ages : It's a cheese fest let me tell you that, boy meets girl both fall in love and then split up over a small misunderstanding before all things are patched up and good at the end. Yeah I know we have seen that story a million times, but that is just used as a plot to play a bunch of songs. The casting of this movie its biggest drawback, when it could have been done better. Catherine zeta Jones wasn't any where close to what she was from Chicago her dance and acting were so difficult to watch. And the two lovers weren't anything to speak of as well both lacked character and chemistry. And Malik Ackerman was just used as an eye candy and nothing else. Paul giamatti does what best could be done with his role. The comedic relief of Russel brand and Alec Baldwin is also spot on. The only good thing about this movie and which holds it together is Tom cruise. He is perfect for the role of the Rock God Stacee jaxx and pulls it off effortlessly,you can see the amount of hard work he puts into each character he plays from this one. You can go watch this one especially for Tom's performance and also it's good to watch something fresh like a musical in the summer for a change instead of the usual CGI - fest that's playing everywhere. Definitely a lot of fun and fans of rock and roll will love it. Though this movie won't have a big opening weekend, it will surely have legs to play on for a long time and make money. Considering its 80's rock & roll and also it being a musical.",Rock of Ages
291,Spookykinkajou,I loved it,9,8 October 2012,"I watched this with my wife last night and we both loved it. For reference, I was born in '76 so a lot of these songs were made when I was young but I was very familiar with almost all the songs played.It started out really cheesy, and both of us were initially reserved about it and considered turning it off and starting something else. But we stayed on, and after a quick internal debate, I said screw it, enjoy the show for what it is.Either the movie got a lot better as it progressed, or I just eased in to the role. We rocked the apartment out.I think your HT setup will greatly influence your involvement with this movie.

This movie was a 2-hour 80s music compilation with excellent digital sound speakers. I enjoyed everything from the costumes to the settings and the props. Everything was right. I grew up on musical movies of the time, Grease, Xanadu, etc.. ROA started off strong and kept that speed with a great cast and beautifully blended rock songs that set the tone of the scenes. I was very impressed. I loved the music, almost as much as the 6 year old that was dancing in the aisle during the music. It's a nice, simple, feel-good movie. No deaths. Nothing explodes from alien attacks.

Talk about missing the mark completely.I mean Tom Cruise as a singer, what a joke.How can you fail so hard in a movie where you've stolen the movie plot of Coyote Ugly and taken a the lyrics from 100hits tracks of the 80s.Listen to some real rock instead of wasting a few hours with this movie.

Catherine Zeta-Jones played her part extremely well (especially when dancing :'] )The main characters drew and sherrie were to be fair quite glee and i don't think they really were the best choice but they acted their parts well and i enjoyed the film throughly and was still singing along quite happily all the way through.I love all the bands that were featured and i think that played a big part in making this a fantastic watch.This film maybe should have made a 15 in the UK (its a 12a) just because there is a lot of adult humour and strip clubs etc.",Rock of Ages
295,ShawnIsaacs1,"Inconsistent but overall, not bad.",8,16 June 2012,"I came into this movie with little expectations. I was unsure of how it was going to unfold but instead of being critical, I allowed myself to be taken on the ride.That being said, even with the laid back approach I took in watching this movie, there were some things that I thought were awesome and some things I thought were terrible.AWESOME: Some of the songs that were performed, were done in amazing harmony;the monkey; Russel Brand's comedic presence; the scenes between ""stacciee jaxxx"" and ""constance sack"" were pretty intense and full of chemistry; the cinematography during major events really popped and was full of color and excitement; cameo by a former WWE wrestler!; lastly, because I'm a guy... Julianne Hough shows off her immense hotness.TERRIBLE: Juianne Hough's solos were a bit off... she sounds kind of like a squirrel. Think Chipmunk. Might be more on par; The songs were not actually a part of any storyline. The lyrics were not strictly used to carry plot. Some were just randomly placed; the lyrics not really making any sense or contributing to the event in time. It was a little odd; The young man who played opposite Hough, as the main character, had a pretty underwhelming performance. His renditions were some of the ones I disliked the most; The worst performance though, has to go to the song and dance number by Catherine Zeta-Jones in the church. Thank goodness for Mary J. Blige redeeming Pat Benetar later in the movie because Zeta-Jones and her backups did not hit you with their best shots... at all.If you are holding a critical lens to this movie, it probably will not deliver the goods for you.

296,mike-major4,A Rocking great movie.,7,27 November 2012,"This film is set in 1987, when I was 41 years old. But, this is my kind of music, this is my kind of humour and above all this is most definitely my kind of movie.Rock of Ages maintains its fast moving, ""tongue in cheek"", rock and rolling style throughout. How refreshing to see big Hollywood stars able to let their ""wigs"" down and have a great time in the process of making a movie. This movie could have been as sentimental as Grease or as off the wall as Rocky Horror Show but it trod the line and was more Dirty Dancing with lashings of testosterone. Fantastic over- the- top rock and rolling. The plot line rocked along so fast that the superb music and dance sequences had trouble keeping up. Three separate love stories, a rags to riches tale, a falling star making good in the end and enough raunchy sex to keep everybody happy. What more could a movie need. Well it did have more, it had Tom Cruise.In the past I have not been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he carried this movie from his first scene. His portrayal of aging Rock Star, Stacee, was amazing, he seemed to relish the excesses but still managed to show that glimmer of emotion in the scenes that needed it. Performing the song Pour Some Sugar on Me"". a fantastic Def Leppard anthem, he strutted the stage like he owned it, and he definitely did own it.

298,Dervis,"Funny, lively, entertaining, and Tom Cruise at his best",10,15 June 2012,"Connacht Sentinel newspaper, Galway, Ireland...The first thing I did after watching this movie was to download the soundtrack – it was that good! And, it's not many movies that you emerge from with a smile on your face. Well, Rock of Ages had all the elements to make it a brilliant movie – funny, fast paced, lively, entertaining, a top notch cast and, not to mention, the music. This is the Broadway musical brought to life – think of the quality of the big screen version of Chicago – with a lot of nostalgia thrown in. It's 1987, and the dress code is tight leather trousers with fringes, long hair, eye liner, nail varnish, and studs – and that was just the men. Boy bands and pop music was waiting in the wings, for its chance to break the reverie of this golden age. The movie tells the story of Sherrie (Hough) who leaves her home in Oklahoma seeking fame and fortune in LA, where she meets Drew, another aspiring singer, who works in the famous Bourbon Rooms, where Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) launched his career, and is due back for a final gig with his group, Arsenal, before going solo. Owner (Baldwin) desperately needs the gig to save Bourbon Rooms from the white collar 'housewife next door type', Patricia Whitmore (Jones) who, as the Mayor's wife, is intent on cleaning up LA of venues like this and Rock music in general. In fact, her vigour is closely focused on Jaxx, who she considers is a bad influence on young people – enjoying the rock n' roll lifestyle too much, and is more often comatose on drink and drugs than on stage performing. Turns out, she was once a groupie, and figures in a long list of women discarded by him through the years. I can't remember the last time Tom Cruise was this good in a movie. He is very slick as the burned-out, hard-living, boob-grabbing star, and was obviously not afraid to take on risqué outfits (particularly his first one), dancing and singing, for the role. It is not until Rolling Stones journalist, Constance Stack (Akerman) interviews him before the big gig and, frustrated with his obvious incompetence, tells him straight that he's washed up, that his previous talent for writing and performing cannot save him now. What follows is a nicely choreographed scene between the two of them – in true 80s style it involved him taking off her glasses and letting her hair down. By the way, that particular scene, among others, were so steamy that I'd have to question the 12A (IRELAND) certificate! It was nice to see that the two main leads got top billing, although Cruise really is the star of the show. Prepare for a summer of nostalgic revivals of great 'air guitar' hits from Guns 'n' Roses, Bon Jovi, Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Chicago, and maybe some very select items from the fashion of the time. Now, where did I leave my cowgirl boots...DG",Rock of Ages

The songs used in this movie..great..great..all my favorite bands, Scorpion, Guns N Roses, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard...and the solo artists..Those were the best part of musical time..Time of Rock of Ages. Though all those came to us in early 90s but they made that mind of us. As the Rock n Roll made the city. Thanks to Tom Cruise and other all stars. And the Director and Producer. The basic cry of that movie was ' Rock is dead' ..by the upcoming trends of new style of song. But this rock n roll people, by their style of life, attitudes and believes gave youth to live a life. The cold war era, people all over the world were confused about Left or Right block.

300,angelh55,Rock Of Ages Review,8,15 June 2012,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from Rock Of Ages. Being that I don't like musicals with the exception of Grease. So what do I think of the soundtrack? Was it what I expected? No. It was way better than I expected. Not sure who actually sang and who lip-sync, but all the songs sounded amazing. I caught myself jamming, tapping my foot, and at times rocking my head back and forth. Now about the storyline. It started kinda shaky in the beginning. The storyline really came together and got more exciting when Stacee Jaxx's character was introduced. From there on, it just took off and it was an exciting ride. I'm not a big fan of 3D movies at all. But to really get the full experience of this movie, you'll really want to see it in 3D. This movie was made for 3D. Now the people who stole show in this movie... I was really surprise and blown away how good Tom Cruise was as Stacee Jaxx. I really don't think anyone else could have done a better job as Stacee Jaxx. Malin Akerman also gave an amazing performance. Paul Giamatti was perfect as the music manager. The surprise star of the movie who just impressed me the most has to be Mary J. Blige. I knew the girl can sing. I didn't know she could really act. She was awesome. I really hope to see Mary J. Blige in more movies. If you grew up in the 80's, this movie will bring back fond memories of the good old days. Everyone else. Rock and roll doesn't get any better than this. You will not be disappointed at all. I give this movie 4.5 out of 5. The soundtrack is definitely worth buying. So go check it out.",Rock of Ages

This was a little LA based musical that turned into a Broadway hit. And eventually spawned stage musical versions around the world. And a major movie adaptation. Every version of the story is true to the origin, pure Rock fun. Tom Cruise brings an awesome over the top take on the rockers of the time. Hough and Boneta bring solid performances to the other leads. Then there are Zeta-Jones, Malin Akerman, Baldwin, and Brand who own there moments. So good.

Impressive, crazy, superb artist T. Cruise. Almost demonic at times. His ""Stacee Jaxx"" is deeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. I always remember that anecdote about Picasso (yep, I'll go there) - about the drawing on a napkin... Gold out of nothing. Real Alchemy. The cast is perfect. Music selection is excellent. One thing that always impresses me is the level of depth and effort that Hollywood stars invest in every detail.

303,fjuka,When did you grow up?,8,26 September 2012,"Well if you grew up during the 70's or 80's this movie is a must see, great cast, great music.Guess the story could've been better but really this is more about the music and a sweet trip down memory lane, for me anyways.Didn't know it was a musical when i began watching, not really a fan of musicals but this one hits the spot...right on!I highly recommend this one it's actually pretty great :)Too bad I've got to write some more letters down here to be able to submit my review i really wouldn't want to submit any spoilers so im making a meaningless sentence here so i can submit :) , just watch it!",Rock of Ages
304,lbirta,"Just think, a years worth of trash in one movie.",3,10 October 2012,"I've been to a lot of rock concerts and none had half the garbage that spewed out of this flick. The constant barrage of unnecessary trash and soft porn, not to mention the usual requisite gay scene thrown in (so obviously out of place it was laughable), spoiled a decent performance of some of history's great rock songs. Julianne Hough did quite well in her first acting gig. I get the image Tom Cruise was trying to portray but it was so over the top even for a spoof. Tom Cruise inhabits the role of Stacee Jaxx, transforming himself into a bizarrely compelling, sex-enslaved rock god. But the fact that he's not very satisfied with all that promiscuity doesn't change the fact that viewers get an eyeful of flesh along the way. The same dynamic is at work with poor Sherrie's decision to become a stripper. Then there's the uptight depiction of condemning Christian women who secretly long to indulge their own lusty impulses. Suffice it to say that people of faith don't come across as anything more than loudmouthed, cardboard-cutout hypocrites here. For all that, though, Rock of Ages is so ridiculously over the top, so utterly, cheesily campy, that you might be tempted to just enjoy those old songs and not think too critically about all that cartoony carnality. After all, the two nice kids get together in the end. Does it really matter that the hometown girl from Oklahoma has to work at a strip club before we get the whole happily-ever-after ending? She comes to her senses eventually, right? But that's just the problem. ""Feel good"" entertainment that mixes the emotional payoffs with the sleaze and the cheese have an insidious way of foolin' us into ignoring the ugliness of the material generating those good feelings.",Rock of Ages
305,tmorgan-533-433938,poorly executed,2,19 November 2012,"I think this is the worst movie I have seen this year. Acting was fine; Baldwin, Brand, Hough, and Giamatti and some of the others were really good. I loved the sets and the camera work, but the good parts end there. Something was wrong with much of the sound and the music was weak versions of soft rock which which didn't fit with the plot. It was good that they did their own singing, but something with the sound production made it sound like it wasn't their own voices. The exception being Mary Blige who sounded perfect. The choreography was blatantly weak. Poor Zeta Jones looked terrible in her dance bit. Worst sin of all; they gave Houghs character a dancing job and never showed her dancing. That's an unforgivable waste of talent. It just struck me as a missed opportunity. With another director, music director and sound people this might have been really good.",Rock of Ages
306,gonza-rnr,Absolutely Destroys Everything Rock Stands For,3,1 February 2013,"This film features Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and the most iconic rock songs of 1980's. What can go wrong, right? Well, almost everything.The only ones who managed to give something to the movie were Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand mostly. The only ones who remotely play a ""rockish-sort-of character"". Beyond that point, the movie just crumbles down.The first conceptual mistake was to even try to attempt shuffling in a blender Hard Rock (mostly L.A.'s glam), Broadway ""Gleeish"" robotic & synthetic voices, and the crappiest of Pop you can find. When you start from that point, you're doomed to failure. Of course, they destroy those iconic songs, at least most of them, with surreal voices, detached from any feeling. The most painfully performed song was, my all time favorite Here I Go Again. Oh My God!!!The second horrifying mistake are the main characters. So full of crap, they are indeed ""frucking posers"". One can see right through bull""sheet"".And those main characters were plain bullsheet. There is no fault in Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough, however, they do not give anything to improve them neither. I think they did not inspire them on any rockish figure at all. I mean, with all respect, Robbie Williams and Pink have more attitude than these two characters. They are a whole lotta more close to Lady Gaga and Justin Beaver than anything remotely rockish. Cheesy, frucking dumb, and again detached from any feeling, rebellion or attitude at all.Rock and Roll stands for many things, there is better and there is worse. I didn't expect to listen to a Rock Star's Miljenko Matijevic voice, but this was truly dreadful. They fail either to conceive the attitude and personality of rock, and the musical skills to perform these iconic songs.I gave it the outrageous amount of 3 points for the good interpretation of the three actors mentioned above, and a slightly ingenious sense of humor that makes it barely bearable.I would not hesitate to qualify this movie as an utterly and complete failure.",Rock of Ages
307,yo_bonney,Great great great movie!!,7,25 June 2012,I absolutely loved this movie. The plot was a little hard to follow at times because of different stuff happening in the movie but overall it was really great. Tom Cruise did a good job singing and is totally sexy in this movie. Usually I don't like Tom Cruise but he did this part justice. If you haven't seen this movie go and see it. I just bought the soundtrack and I am anxiously awaiting the DVD. Just can't wait to see Tom Cruise as Stacee Jaxx again! The story starts out with a girl and guy trying out their luck in the big city with singing. They start a romance and break up due to a misconception on the the guys part that the girl had had a close relationship with Stacee Jaxx in his dressing room. They get back together later in the movie. But Seriously watch this movie. I would love to go see it again while it is still at the theater but I will just wait till it comes to DVD. I will definitely buy it on the release date.,Rock of Ages

It is more like pop, well what do you expect from the director of Hair Spray and other Musical Movies, he made it mainstream to probably make it more appealing. I also agree with the other reviewers that it doesn't even give the right information about rock/metal. Rock/Metal is not just about sex, drugs and rock n' roll, it is much deeper than that. 1 point for the all star casts (minus points for them being miscast for their roles). 1 point for the effects, ""rock and roll"" feel. 2 points for some good renditions and selection of songs.

I was expecting a movie packed with music from bands like black Sabbath, Guns N Roses, AC/DC. Instead my ears were tortured to the sound of 2 1/2 hours of the worst music of the era. Instead of picking music that defined the era it was a non stop commercial for those ""Arena Ballads"" mixed CDs they sold on TV in the 90s and early 2000's. They really had a chance to make something charming and nostalgic, instead you have metal looking dudes singing commercial butt rock. To top it off their ""Rock God"" character is played by none other than Tom Cruise. Im sorry but this guy is just not believable in that roll at all. They really needed an actor that could carry the roll with all the charisma and presence of a thunder god.",Rock of Ages

The script writing is awful, and the movie was cliché. I can't imagine why would Tom Cruise accept to do a film of this sort. This film would get a 1/10 from me, but because of the good songs they put in there, I'll give it a 3/10. An awful movie.

Now imagine that and then having Nicki Menaj put more vocals on top of it. Now imagine all that and auto-tune everything with T-Pain putting more vocals on it. Can you imagine all of that?

312,millerwa76,Mixed Review,5,13 September 2013,"I enjoy the occasional musical, and as far as musicals go, this one was produced very well. But I get the sense that I'd have enjoyed the stage production far more than I enjoyed the film. The good: Overall, the movie did a really nice job of bringing you back to the 80s. Anyone over the age of maybe 35 who even has memories of this era even as a pre- teen should get a lot of happy nostalgic feelings from it. I thought that much of the dialogue and acting by several of the main characters was on par with how they would have spoken and acted in 1987. The basic plot was something right out of the 1980s Hollywood playbook.....cheeky love story, overzealous villain, and healthy dose of rebellion, which was a mainstay in nearly all of the great 80s flicks. The bad: Oh, where to begin? 1. Some really great songs were butchered.2. Tom Cruise was horribly miscast if for no other reason than the fact that watching him try to move and gyrate like Axl Rose or Steven Tyler was just really, really awkward. If you're going to cast someone as a drunken, coked out rock star then you might want to go for someone who weights 140 lbs. Cruise just doesn't have that ""rocker body."" I thought Russell Brand would have actually been a better choice for this role. He has the right look and could pull it off far better than Cruise ever could. Plus, I'm pretty sure that being a drunk coke head comes really naturally to him. 3. Alec Baldwin just didn't belong in this movie....anywhere. There's nothing about him at any point in this movie that makes me feel like he's an authentic rock head. He was about as uptight at times as you can get, especially whenever he was required to sing and dance. Just terrible. 4. The movie takes place in 1987, yet a couple of songs in the soundtrack weren't out in 1987. More Than Words didn't come out until 1990. Minor continuity/dating issues is one thing, but that song wasn't even recorded in the same decade. 5. The introduction of the bubble gum wannabe hip hop boy band towards the end was probably the worst part of the entire movie. I get it that they were trying to liken them to New Kids on the Block, but NK didn't blow up until 1989. But even worse than that, the clothing they were wearing was more like something you'd see between 1991-93. That look wasn't really in vogue in 1987. A smarter decision would have been to make them some really corny imitation of the Beastie Boys.All in all, it was a mostly fun movie that knocked it out of the park in some aspects and completely whiffed in others. Even though the movie is close to 2 hrs, it felt like the ending was rushed and they didn't put much effort into wrapping everything up. So watch it at your own risk. If you're old enough to remember this period, then a lot of things you see in the movie will really take you back, but you're also going to get a little angry at some of the inconsistencies and poor casting decisions. Didn't hate it, but doubt I'll ever watch it again either.",Rock of Ages

It's a funny movie with some really good songs and most of the actors do a pretty good job. (Well it's obvious that Russell Brand is the comic relief character but this doesn't mean that it's bad).The plot is not something special but I think its better this way since the point of the whole movie is to show how both the protagonists eventually change.

315,emma-r-vw,"Came for the music, left after about half an hour",4,7 January 2016,"I started watching this movie while thinking ""A not-so-good but very enjoyable movie about 80's hair metal? Count me in!"" I love those kind of movies and I love 80s music. So I thought I was in for a treat. But when Julianne Hough inexplicably started singing on a bus with the whole bus joining in within the first few minutes, I decided that I was not. However, I know we can all make mistakes and gave the movie a try. But things got even tackier after that. Maybe I just couldn't stand Julianne Hough with her small town-girl-moves-to-big-city character, maybe it was all the clichés you could possibly think of, forced into 15 minutes of film. That made me change my mind though. ""Perhaps the filmmakers meant this one as a parody?"" I thought to myself. You know, just like 'Not Another Teen Movie' and all (because to be honest, I sort of enjoyed that movie). But not even that mindset made it work. The jokes were just not funny, it was too try-hard with its music references, the characters were tacky and the story was ridiculous. Now I know these kind of musicals tend to be a little over the top, but I don't mind as long as the actors have the charm to pull it off. I mean Mamma Mia! was just cute that way, who doesn't love seeing Meryl Streep pouring her heart out in an ABBA song? But it didn't work for this movie. I tried so hard to love it though. There were some scenes that I liked. I even sort of liked that character Patricia Whitmore - until she broke out in a rendition of Pat Benatar's Hit Me With Your Best Shot along with her fellow Christian house moms. What? I think the only thing I really liked about this movie was Bryan Cranston. I kept telling myself to give it a try, to keep watching because it would probably get better, that I hadn't even seen much of Tom Cruise. But when Diego Boneta broke out in an acoustic version of Don't Stop Believin with one of the corniest jokes imaginable to follow, I decided to love myself and stopped watching. 4/10, because I hated it as much as I hated Moulin Rouge (2001).",Rock of Ages

How on Earth did the script for this movie ever get past the screening process? I don't write many reviews but felt obligated, based on my 80's heritage, to chime in on this one. They were treading on ""hallowed grounds"" with many of the songs they covered and just TRAMPLED them. The screenplay of Rock of Ages needed to be dropped in a shredder along with whoever wrote it. Based upon its loss of $15 million at the box office, that may have already happened. Please Hollywood...no more movies like this one.Rock Star (Mark Walhberg) and Detroit Rock City (Edward Furlong) were much better representations (although certainly not perfect) of the spirit of the 80's rock/metal era.

Every now and then a snippet will poke its tale into my mind and I find myself laughing uncontrollably. Its like a secret joke that no one else knows about.

I love musicals and, whilst not being a die hard enthusiast, I like a bit of rock music too.Unfortunately, this takes a number of classic rock songs and popifies them. As I say, I'm no devout rocker but I always thought that the essence of rock was to rage against the concepts of corporations, following mainstream ideologies, as well as pretty much anything that tells you to 'do as you're told'. Adding a pop tinge to the majority of the songs really felt like it flew in the face of that essence. I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if Simon Cowell was among the producer credits.And I know that rock music's popularity has been on the wane for some time now, but I don't believe this is the way to re-ignite the spark. Like how good story-telling can successfully lead an audience through the intricacies of films like 'Inception' without having to dumb things down, I believe good story-telling could deliver a rock film with mass appeal without dulling the edge of a guitarist's most trusty axe.There are a few good supporting performances, chief among them Tom Cruise as Stacie Jaxx.

It was absolutely stunning to me, that it got any review above one star. AND it was critically acclaimed by some of, what the entertainment industry considers, the best movie critics in their field. WTF! To the people that rated it on the higher side, did you actually see the same movie?! Look, I'm not by any means, a die-hard movie critic; I very rarely write any comments or reviews against the thousands of movies that I have seen over my lifetime. This one was a beckoning that I could not refuse.Where do I begin I have to get Tom Cruise props. He has an amazing voice. It is a crying shame that was wasted on a script like this; the smart play would've been to stick to action films. Julianne Hough Why? The entire secondary storyline between Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand What in the world were they thinking? If these two gentlemen weren't established entertainers to begin with, this particular ""breakthrough film"" could have possibly been a career limiting maneuver.This film took some of the best songs ever written and performed in the 80s, and built a ridiculous storyline around something, that someone, somewhere thought would be a money-making idea.I'm not sure what the box office total grossed, but hopefully it was enough to pay the copyright and license fee to all the wonderful 80s entertainers who songs were, for the lack of a better word ""butchered."" Not everything can be turned into a movie; this was a prime example. I'm not sure if the Broadway play was a smash or not. The film was a massive disappointment across the board. It could have been fun, if I had kept my eyes closed, and just listened to the music. It would've been along the same lines as a ""K-Tel"" spin off of the original work.The ranting is now finished. Everybody has an opinion about pretty much everything. Myself included I tried to let this one go, but it just kept gnawing at me, and I just had to tell somebody. Take the above for what it's worth, and a grain of salt. I am, in no way, attempting to sway anyone from seeing this movie.

I spent some time hanging around Hollywood and The Strip in the mid-seventies, ten years before the story, but it was in character for this film. What I really appreciated is how the story fell into place quite nicely, no bumbling and fumbling editing. The songs were sung with believable passion. It was very romantic.

The first 5 minutes including the opening of the credits was bad, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and kept watching. By about a half hour I wanted to turn it off, but didn't. By the time I got to about an hour, which is about half way through. I looked and seen that I had over an hour left, I was like this movie is history. It was bad, really bad. I should have known that the movie was gonna blow when I learned Tom Cruise was in it. I mean come on, Tom Cruise playing a 80's hair-band singer? It just doesn't work. He also was just terrible in it. Im surprised he would even do a movie like that anyway. I would think that it would go against his ""scientology "" views anyway. Katherine Zeta Jones as A Tipper Goreish type who wants to put A ban on metal because she has a personal vendetta on Stacee (Tom Cruise' Character) her singing part was ridiculous. Don't even waste your time watching this! I Love 80's metal bands its my ""era"" of music but I kinda had good expectations and was very disappointed.",Rock of Ages

A ton of you were scarred by seeing the movie and want your two hours back? Didn't you see the trailer. Didn't you know what the movie was going to sound like or look like? I was quite impressed how the songs turned out and they seemed more rock than Broadway show tunes. If you like '80's rock and want to see a good funny movie this is the one. It is campy and fun and it doesn't make fun of the music. Easily the best musical I've ever seen. And you want to complain about the acting? Come on people, they weren't trying to win Oscars. They wanted to make a fun movie that was true to the music. Watch the trailer before you see it. Listen to soundtrack samples. Don't ruin it for other people.

Well-scripted, spot-on casting, well-acted, the singing, choreography, choices by the actors for their characters, directing, editing, soundtrack. What is the best surprise is that Tom Cruise's voice is perfect for this; raw yet emotive. He nails his role, as do all of his co-actors. This film is a clear U.S. cultural experience in the musical genre like DIRTY DANCING, Saturday NIGHT FEVER, MAMA MIA, CHICAGO, DANCE WITH ME, GREASE, ET AL. See it in the theater.

I have seen it twice so far at the cinema and would go again and again and I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. The music is amazing, if you are a fan of 80's music (like I am) or grew up or was a teen in the 80's you will love this film. The storyline was great, the acting was spot on. Tom Cruise who I don't usually like much is AMAZING and totally rocked the role of Stacie Jaxx. This movie is a lot of fun, I found myself singing along and really feeling for the characters.

Straight at the beginning when an entire bus started singing was just wrong. Continuing with a predictable story line and cheesiness... And also the boy band is just misplaced. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin started singing together in a hairbrush.. The gay scene at the end was the last straw. I probably wouldn't even rent or download the movie.

Everyone was awesome! The script and performance were nicely paced and excellently delivered. It was exhilarating from start to finish. Loved the characters, loved the songs, loved the humour. The familiar soundtracks had subtle purpose to character dimensions. Those from the Eighties might be scared of revisiting the past and popular tracks that matured to cheese, but this film has reclaimed them.

While I'm fully aware that the acting and story-telling could have been better and in a more classy manner, I feel that the goofy, careless mood really helped to relay the aura of the time period to the audience. Personally, I'm a sixteen year old girl with a passion for music, theater, hot guys and cliché romances and this movie offered everything! It also gave me a new passion for 80's rock as I proceeded to download the original versions of each song from the movie immediately upon my return from the movie theater. All in all, I think that those who are able to see past the obvious mess that is this movie, they will absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE it for what it really is- a feel good summer movie that will keep you dancing, singing and laughing for weeks after you see it.

Tom Cruise nailed the typical 80's Rock singers. I loved Russell Brand and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I took my husband with me who wasn't expecting to like the movie since it was a musical and he only watches them because I enjoy them. I honestly want to see it again and went out and got the soundtrack CD already. For those that didn't like it, they must think they are movie critics. People need feel good movies that remind them of their younger years and this movie does it. You will rock and remember all the songs and even remember the concerts you went to back in the 80's. Give it a chance and you just might be pleasantly surprised especially with how well Tom Cruise did singing.

But there's no problem with that in my mind.I saw the stage play two times before, and it was outstanding. It is my favorite musical out there. The movie was a pleasant surprise. It had different parts, twists and turns, and totally different plot climaxes, which I thought were great additions. I must say, the beginning was one of the worst musical beginnings I've seen, but after Juke Box Hero, it really kicked up and got going. The two main actors were not great, they were too weak for the role, but Tom Cruise, as his role was supposed to, stole the spotlight. He was outstanding. One of his best roles ever. No cheesiness in him- very hot, very strong, very kick ass. I must say, the director did a great job of showing his progression as a rock star and where he truly becomes independent and grows up.This movie doesn't have a deep message. If your looking for that, don't see this. If your looking for a good time, see it! It's genuinely funny, the music is awesome. I'm not even from the 80s generation, but I love the era so I loved this. Cheesy love story, good Tom Cruise, good songs, good energy. Like I said, if you were never into that hair metal, peppy Bon Jovi stuff, don't see it. For people who do love their classic 80s, it's just a good time. Personally loved it. Would see it again, so entertaining.",Rock of Ages

If you're into any magic bands like Guns'n'Roses, Motley Crue, Poison etc, if you lived or at least know what really was Sunset Boulevard in L.A., spandex, hot girls, sleazy rock please SKIP this one. Screenplay is ridiculous, songs are nice (obviously) but there are too many of them. I really wonder how Tom Cruise could have accepted to act in so many ridiculous scenes. The worst is that is not even funny! So if you want a funny movie about rock bands check ""This is Spinal Tap"", if want the story of a young heavy-rock singer go for ""Rockstar"" and if you want a good musical full of nice girls go for ""Burlesque"".

It was a film i was dubious about seeing in the first place but while on holiday a tropical storm, producing a foot of rain per hour, meant that we wanted to get inside for a couple of hours and the choice was this or Prometheus which my girlfriend didn't want to see. This film was so appalling that 11 people in the theatre decided they would rather forget about the money they had paid to get in and walk around in the bad weather, as did I. There are so few funny moments and the music was less rock more glee. Not only was the choice of music disappointing but then to follow up a normally talented cast all forgot how to act at the same time, Catherine Zeta-Jones the biggest let down, and I couldn't understand why Russel Brand had to use a Birmingham accent (not very well either as he kept switching between Brum and his natural voice). Mary J Blige should stay well away from film in the future as it's clear to see she wasn't chosen for her acting ability. The storyline? Again, terrible. The only reason this film got a 2 is because Tom Cruise showed some diversity with his character, breaking away from the usual action-type he plays but even his contribution was ruined by such a poorly written script that took away anything he might have been able to add.

I understand that but after 15min in the movie you get what it is all about! And you need a good sense of humor to actual get this movie! To be honest, it has great performances from all the great names, amazing soundtrack and a story that will make you laugh if you let it and if you can keep up with everything that is happening on screen!

If Russell Brand didn't show up occasionally for comic relief it would be unwatchable. An amazing selection of music - all the great rock ballads from the 70's and 80's and more, absolutely SLAUGHTERED by corny actors. I just hope I can listen these song again in the future without having the image of a weirder and sleazier (if that's possible) Tom Cruise appear in my mind.The main plot was weak and subsequently the sub plots became a little more interesting, but this just made it difficult to follow the movie at all. Scenes just seemed to trip over one-another, probably due to the fact that whenever Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) appears on screen we are overwhelmed with creepy. Very off putting. On a good note Alec Baldwin and Catherine Zeta Jones were fantastic, and of course Russell Brand is always a winner.

348,sight-pedro,Good Premise - Horrible Execution,4,26 September 2012,"Rock of Ages. Wow. I was so disappointed. I've got to say going in I wasn't expecting much, I'd seen the billboards and I could tell this was going to be a pop telltale of the glam scene, but I thought hey, how else would they make it work nowadays. But I certainly wasn't expecting a Glee version of it. Words cannot express how insulting this flick really is for someone who loves the genre.It's not the fact that this movie is less about music and more about the objectification of sex, the main reason is that the music is so very terrible. The manage to slaughter their way across any and all artist they seem to recall from the 80s: ""Oooh let's see here now, who's left we can use...OH I KNOW, EXTREME! OF COURSE! Oh it's unplugged? WELL MORE THE BETTER!"" Leppard is completely desecrated, Scorpions, Night ranger, Foreigner, you name it, all of them shat upon. It's disgraceful. I'm not going to include Poison and Bon Jovi in the above mentioned, because their style I guess would actually fit best with whatever the film's about.I see people on the boards praising cruise and hough's singing skills, and I'm left wondering if they've just watched the same film I did. Cruise cannot sing. Nobody in the cast could sing, but they sure as hell gave it a try. And thus we're submitted to 2hours of incessant wailing as presented by sexually frustrated teens.Even Rock Star(2001) was better, and that movie sucked. This is High School Musical grade, it's simply pathetic. I cannot believe I actually put myself through this. It goes against everything that the 80s stood for, it's highly hypocritical of them to trash rap and high pop when the movie itself is coated with that culture and influences.Do NOT waste your time with this flick, and you can stop believing too, no 80s movie is ever going to come that's going to blow your mind, time and time again they've tried and failed, Hollywood just can't grasp the true meaning of it.Man..the worst part for me was when they sang Warrant..just the tiny bit of it, with lane having died last year, it's so ******* insulting...",Rock of Ages

For me, the movie was more of a sing-a-long with some of my favorite songs from some of my favorite bands of the 1980s.In order to really get the full effect of this movie and to truly enjoy it, don't go in expecting something as dark and serious as Les Mis. Don't expect to see Citizen Kane, or the Shawshank Redemption. If you do, you miss the whole point of this movie.

If you were really into the hairband, you will see that Rock of Ages took the tough out of rock. Not cool, and it was very tormenting to watch, to say the least! Don't waste your time unless you are a big Glee fan. It was a waste of a rental. I thought that Julianne Hough wasn't good for Footloose either.

The story is pretty disappointing, not to say a little bit lame, but thats OK, you don't actually expect to see a Dostoevsky depth in this kind of movie, just pure entertainment. The character development is nice, specially Tom Cruise's, Russel Brand 's, Alec Baldwin's and Paul Giammati's ones, the lead roles are too recycled, but i think it wouldn't work if they were not, it's a silly story so they fit. It's a mildly funny movie, you can have a few laughs, nothing wrong with it. Now... the song selection is just great, if you like that kind of music you'll like this movie. period. When comes to the singing, i was blown away by tom cruise, not that he is the best singer in the world, but i never thought he could do it, tuned and really passionate, although he doesn't have a really good range, it is good, and wanted dead or alive was awesome. Besides, his performance as jaxx is awesome as well. The others were OK, just what i expected, with the exception of the lead girl, which just sounds like a cat having sex, i mean, shes tuned and stuff, but i really DISLIKE that voice... really bad... and when the black diva starts to sing( god bless black women's voices)i feel really sorry for her.Normally i would hate that movie...2 or 3 stars, but the song selection, tom cruise and the black diva made wanting watch it again...",Rock of Ages

Giving off the perfect disorientation of the 80s rock scene with a simple but well put together storyline. The characters are portrait wonderfully. I was sceptical to start with; Tom Cruise as a rocker? But wow he had it down pact. His show-off ego + macho wannabe stance really proved a great asset. But what surprised me more - he can sing - and sound awesome! Alec Baldwin as you've never seen him before, wow he has staunchly soft side. To my amazement he really complemented his trusty side-kick, Russell Brand. Russell Brand, what can I say? he has YET to disappoint. With his charming childlike ignorance and his devilishly delicious wit - its definitely one of his best performances yet. The 2 leads, Julianne Hough& Diego Boneta. Absolutely incredible. Julianne played a lead in Footloose (not the greatest asset to her cv) but this has definitely set the bar high!! Diego is a extraordinary fresh face (and a very handsome one too). He makes the film what it is. As the leading man he really does this justice. I nearly cried when I discovered they had cut his beautiful hair off.. but it really draws you in, allowing you to believe that this is a real story with real people. The best thing of all? The mixture of new and old. The fact that the director gave the leading roles to relatively inexperienced actors and left the subs to the tried and true. And he did the same thing with the music too!!! Mashups, a couple of awesome new hits and a lot of old favs will get you dancing in your pants :) The downside?> Mary J ""im gona act all cool cos that how I want people to see me"" Blige; Catherine ""im too prim and proper to act like I mean it"" Zeta-Jones; James Martin Kelly.

Alec Baldwin, whom I haven't seen anything good from since Hunt for the Red October, was seemingly born to play his role.It's unpretentious and quite funny, even for someone like me with a taste for the deeper dramatics, and not usually musicals. At the steep price of a cinema ticket I was very happy to part with the cash to be entertained by Rock of Ages. If you liked Mamma Mia, you'll enjoy this.It's a feel-good musical for anyone who lived through the 80's and 90's, with some 'anthemic' numbers that defined an era.

This movie focuses on midwestern beauty, Sherri Christian, a girl who moves to Los Angeles from Tulsa to find fame and fortune. After being robbed of all of her favorite records and belongings, she meets a bar hand named Drew. Drew helps her get a job in her dream venue, The Bourbon Room, which is in danger of being shut down by the mayor's crazy, God-fearing, metal- hating, and ""upstanding citizen"" of a wife. Meanwhile, Stacee Jaxx is becoming a washed up rock star who needs to go solo to save his career from failure, but his manager is a greedy, slimy person who won't let Jaxx or The Bourbon Room see a penny of what was earned. Obviously Sherri and Drew fall in love and need to save The Bourbon Room from being closed down for good while helping Stacee Jaxx's career from falling in the toilet. Cliché, I know, but hear me out when I say that this is the ultimate feel-good film of summer 2012. If you can get past the cheesiness of the first 5 or 6 minutes, then it's totally worth your time and money to see. The cast is fantastic, the plot never gets worn out, and the music is INCREDIBLE! Who knew you could have so much fun watching a rock musical? It was difficult to NOT sing along to Poison, Journey, Twisted Sister, Guns and Roses, Pat Benatar, and much, much more. The only downfall I would like to point out is that it made me really miss my long-distance boyfriend because it was for sure a date movie. Some people who deserve more credit than what was mentioned:Catherine Zeta-Jones: Very convincing as her roll as the protagonist, Patricia Witmore.

Zeta-Jones was again just okay in the role- the Twisted Sister song deserved better and louder as it's against the norm not in the norm.

I went in and gave it an honest chance and had to get out of there when Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin started singing together in a hairbrush. It almost seemed like a really bad version of a Glee episode. The music selection we heard was great, but it was very ""karaoke"" and I didn't care much for that. I couldn't even stay in my seat long enough to see Tom Cruise's character. Frankly, I'm not even sure I could rent this movie to see if the rest was as bad as it began. The trailer for the movie gave it a much different ""feel"" and it was kind of deceiving. Big thumbs down from me!!",Rock of Ages
364,evmelissa,Review,10,18 June 2012,"I went in with expectation of it being cheesy and all, but Tom Cruise really impressed me. Anyone that grew up listening to this kind of music and remembers buying records, you should go see it. It will bring back memories and make you laugh. I just hope this music makes a come back and I'm NOT the only one at jukebox who plays Poison, Cinderella, David Lee Roth, Def Leppard, etc...Cinderella was missing from the movie,and so agree that Oh Sherrie should have been in the movie. I kept waiting for it! Go see it, just to see Tom Cruise in...well ladies, check it out! Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand were excellent together, I never would have put the 2 of them together, but it worked.",Rock of Ages
365,eosten-400-116801,You can still hate Cruise - but he Rocks Rock of Ages,7,18 June 2012,"Summary: Tom Cruise Rocks this movie; Alec and Russell comic relief; Julianne Hough should stick to dancing - not acting or singing; Malin - great voice and comic timing; Diego who? Zeta-Jones - great singing - but stop smoking - your skin is showing the overuse of tobacco! I remember being a teenage girl, buying Top Gun for the eye candy of Tom Cruise and his horrible crooning of I've Lost that Lovin' Feeling. Then over the years his strange antics and weirdness lost it for me and I began avoiding movies he was in even though, he is a heck of an actor. We all love to hate Tom Cruise because he is so over the top. But when you see this movie, first, he's 50 years old and looks at least 10 years younger. His voice - you would never know it had potential after that poor Top Gun attempt. He is worth the ticket price to the theatre (regular - don't waste money on 3D or Imax for this). NOW - to the rest of the movie. As a child of the 80's there is so much about this movie I could rip apart. The sets, the clothes, the hair (e.g. Julianne Hough has Farrah Fawcett hair from the 70s. Malin had it right with the perm - but it should have been even bigger -think Working Girl) So the film lacked some authenticity.Now let's talk about the talent - again, Tom Cruise - WOW! Julianne Hough - ICK! Her high-pitched, pinched, nasaly, whiny tones hurt this classically trained singer's ears. Open your pallet Julianne - you can still sing in chest voice and not be nasal! There are so many other singers out there that would have been better in this role, like Emma Stone (she rocked out on Easy A) or Emmy Rossum. Diego who? He had a good voice, but is forgettable. Russell Brand - surprisingly good vocals. Alec Baldwin - lacked support - lift from the diaphragm! Malin Akerman - great voice. Loved her in 27 Dresses. Catherine Zeta-Jones - I love her voice. Paul Paul! I know you can sing better than you did in this movie. Did you eat nails? Mary J. Blige - she is never off - she is just incredible.Now let's talk about the music. I love the mash-ups. I love Def Leppard. I'm glad this musical gives some props to Pat Benatar. She is not the only female rocker though from the 80's. I know it was a heavy hair band era - and this is the 'movie' version of a stage musical. There were a lot of rock bands MIA and a lot of Journey, REO, Bon Jovi, Survivor, Def Leppard - btw- where is the cover song Rock of Ages - the title of this thing????? Whoever wrote this musical didn't reach too far past their favorite rockers of the 80s. Since the music is all situational (based on the emotions and situation), there are so many more songs that could have been more appropriate. But again, stage musical to the big screen. I would have written a better screenplay and swapped out the music (Artistic license and all).Now let's talk about the story. Cheesy, predictable, some of it boring, some of it unnecessary (queue the major and his side dish of assistant - who cares?) Again, I would have rewritten this screenplay - that is what a screenplay is for! Adam Shankman - Hairspray was so good. Maybe you have too much on your plate with SYTYCD and Step up revolution. Step back, take your time and get it right.Journey - I hope you are reaping some royalties off this movie and Glee. Don't Stop Believin' is going to be one of the most used songs on the planet.So overall, I give this a 7 - with Tom Cruise pulling it up from a 4 that I'd give it without him. Otherwise, my suggestion is - don't go into this with grand expectations of great acting or a great spoof. Enjoy Tom Cruise, enjoy the nostalgia of the 80s rock music, try NOT to sing along with it as I almost did (I knew every word to every song) and just have fun. Then - you won't feel like it was a waste of time or money. OR - wait for the DVD. It's worth the redbox fee.",Rock of Ages

It is NOT a movie to take your kids to, however:) We grew up in the 80's and it brought back so many great memories. Tom Cruise and Russell Brand were excellent, as always. I really didn't find the other actors as appalling as the other reviews stated. On the whole, it was quite enjoyable. We laughed and sang along like two teenagers. In fact, I plan to see it again this week with a girlfriend. Rock of Ages is destined to become a cult classic. Not everyone gets other cult classics such as Rocky Horror Picture Show or Pulp Fiction, and this will be no exception. We, however, found it very entertaining and I feel quite confident that we will purchase it when it is released to DVD.

It put me right in the Bourbon Room audience, blithely wearing the tasteless and bizarre outfits that I couldn't wear because I was setting a standard of decorum for my kids in those days, and embarrassing them was anathema. It features a period of Rock (1987) when the genre was flanked by inane crap ""music"" aimed at the 13-16 year olds I was raising. Fortunately they didn't bite. This movie features the memorable music of the decade that my grandson is now still honoring. This music and that of the late 60's and early 70's helped me as a beleaguered working mom ""Rock"" through a day of commutes, housework, and culture shock. I don't ""get "" the focus on plot and antics that some of the more ""serious"" reviewers are stroking themselves with. I paid $8.00 and didn't fancy myself being at a rock concert or a stage play, but I got all of that feel and more. I would have paid $30 just to see Baldwin grunged, and desperate but hopeful. Cruise's character looked shaky at first. But as usual, in trademark style, he starts off blasé and then explodes into passion and surprise. Paul Giamatti and Zeta-Jones were fun to despise in their hypocrisy. Hough and Boneta were fresh, talented and beautiful. Mary J. Blige (Justice Charlier) was superb, and although I never ""got"" Russell Brand before, he was the most fun of all. Leave your pretense at home. PLOT!? Yada Yada.

So the story isn't Academy Award material, but it was the most fun we have had at the movies in a while. The 80's music is not the original work, but still performed well and placed great in the movie. Tom Cruise is a hoot in his role (think Axl Rose) and the others weren't bad either. Small cameos by some 80's rock stars. I have seem some references to its similarity to Grease and its portrayal of the 1950's. I think that is a pretty good comparison. Again, if you are not a fan of the 80's, you probably won't like this too much. But, if you like the 80's and its music, you will probably enjoy this movie and leave with a smile.",Rock of Ages

But I really enjoyed Tom Cruise's quirkiness and the humor Alec Baldwin and Russel Brand brought to their characters. The singers did a great job. I didn't particularly love some of their voices, but they didn't do a bad job by any means. The instrumentalists were fantastic. The story is of course amazing, if you've seen the Broadway show then you know what I'm talking about. It may not be for everyone, but bottom line is this: I left the theater smiling and singing, and went home and practiced a lot of guitar afterward!",Rock of Ages
370,PamRob420,A real guilty pleasure! I love you Stacee Jaxx!,9,21 June 2012,"It's a cheesy musical, and that's what made it so much fun. The plot was predictable, but again, it's a cheesy musical. I didn't give the movie a 10 because there were too many sub plots that just seemed to take up time without adding to the movie overall, and the two main characters were very bland. For me Alec Baldwin, as the club's manager, was a pleasant surprise. He seemed miscast, he can't sing at all, and that wig...but I had so much fun watching him. I rose and fell with him emotionally, and laughed both with and at him. The highlight of the film was Tom Cruise. Wow. (I think his character was based on Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx, for the spelling of his name, if nothing else.) He played the aimless over-medicated egotistical rock star character perfectly. He sang well, he came to life on the stage. He made one of the best character entrances since Darth Vader in Star Wars.

It was not meant to be anything other than it is! A fun entertaining musical! I will agree that if you are not from that generation, you may not like it as much. My husband & I both really enjoyed it as we are from that era. I recommend it to everyone who loved the 80's! Just don't take it too seriously.

372,halambert,I thoroughly enjoyed the role of Stacy Jaxx in Rock of Ages,10,23 June 2012,"When I read a recent interview, Tom Cruise talked about undergoing intense voice training for several months for his role in Rock of Ages. Not a big Tom Cruise fan of late, that information piqued my interest to see this movie. I have appreciated Cruise's talent in playing difficult roles in the past, from Interview with a Vampire, to Collateral Damage and Vanilla Sky, to mention just a few. I wanted to see what he could do with Rock of Ages.I thoroughly enjoyed the role of Stacy Jaxx. I thought that Cruise was exceptional in capturing the jaded dissipation of an ageing rock star, who still exuded the sexuality that such a big part of the whole Rock N Roll culture. His physique, the smolderingly confident way in which he moved, and his stage presence during the musical performances were a true joy to watch. His voice was amazingly good. My interest in Cruise as an actor has been renewed as a result of watching Rock of Ages, a movie I intend to enjoy many, many times to come.The rest of the movie was fun and frivolous and a joy to watch. The young lovers played by Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta captured the bittersweet love of youth. Boneta had a wonderful stage presence during his musical performances – he was fresh-faced handsome turned new sex- god during his gritty Rock N Roll numbers. He is a very talented young man.I loved, loved, LOVED the roles played by Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand. Alec's ageing rock acolyte and Brand's exuberant follower-friend- supporter (with a hidden agenda) in the Bourbon Room setting created a dark, gritty, lovely 80s context to the movie that I found delightful. These seasoned actors worked amazingly well together and provided many opportunities for convivial laughter. I was swept away by the excellent vocals, choreography and 80s music that immediately transported me back to a simpler, younger time. I sang with the actors and was so completely involved that I forgot I was watching a movie. I had a great time watching Rock of Ages!Five BIG stars for Rock of Ages *****",Rock of Ages
373,davearcudi,The awesome voice of Tom Cruise,10,24 June 2012,"This was probably the best American film made this millennium. The acting the set pieces and the music all brought me back to my childhood. The best thing of all was the pleasant surprise that every established star; Cruise, Brand, Ackerman, Pig Vomit and most especially Baldwin could sing and not only sing but sing well. The two young leads are nice surprises. Now The Academy rarely gets it right so don't be surprised if this jewel is ignored at Oscar time, then again all the great films: It's a Wonderful Life, Rear Window, The Searchers, Star Wars 77, Airport and Tropic Thunder are often ignored. It is crude, so we as people. I scratch myself and swear and I'm just an over educated middle aged insurance guy. I may have rated it R, but big deal, no one complains about mob movies. I loved every minute of it and someone who doesn't get either doesn't like the music or doesn't know have a good time. This is movie magic at it's best. We are not the thirties Puritans who saw Fred Astaire movies, we twenty-first century Americans who grew up on 80's rock.

374,TracyE0826,Rock of Ages,10,25 June 2012,"Rock of Ages is a musical. If you do not like musicals, don't go and if you do, please do not write a negative review based on the fact that you do not like musicals.I love musicals. Most of them are written to create FUN and FANTASY. Rock of Ages did exactly that.Musicals are not about reality or heavy dramatic acting. They are by nature spoofy and light. Rock of Ages is all that and more.Musicals are meant to be entertaining and uplifting. Rock of Ages hits the mark right on target.I was in my 20's in the 80's and I worked in a rock and roll club. It smelled of beer and cigarettes and sweat and puke. Sex, drugs and Rock & Roll was the mantra. The music was good enough and the beer free enough to make the rest not matter. Rock of Ages decently portrayed all of that minus the smells. (Thank goodness!) The cast was dead on in their portrayals of innocence lost, desperation of dreams unfulfilled and the hope that the rock ballads of the era were promoting.I give the story and the film two thumbs up.

The movie is a concoction of big Hollywood names, cheesy 80's music and a predictable love story but for some reason, it seems to work.Although I don't have much to say for the two lead roles, the like of Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand made the whole movie for me, proving me with endless laughs especially during their duet. With Tom Cruise effortlessly making every woman in the theatre swoon and Catherine Zeta-Jones stealing every scene she's in, no wonder its everyone's cup of tea.If you don't sing or dance the full way through this you mustn't have a funny bone in your body!

However the rest of the cast were amazing in their craft. I love how a jumble of circumstances that happened to various rock bands were merged together to tell a history of eighties rock.The main story of two young kids trying to make it on their own, while falling in love. and a Jaded rocker, who meets his Cinderella of sorts who makes him conscious of his surroundings, that his manager has been doing things behind his back. With other various side stories.There is some confusion in the story, with the seventies strip club, in conjunction with the start of the nineties boy bands. My ADD started kicking in... otherwise it was a good musical romp down the Eighties Highway.I came out of the movie with two thoughts, A) Someone has got to get Tom Cruise to reprise his role for a performance of Pour Some Sugar on Me for the Oscars. and B) Can we now do the sequel, The Vampire Lestat?",Rock of Ages

There were parts of the film that you could tell were meant to be humorous but quite frankly they were poorly executed and few and far between. Not up to the usual comedic standard of Brands' other works. The actual singing which is pretty much all the way through, in parts nearly made my ears bleed! Better singers may have made this film more bearable, but as they murdered pretty much every song they did, all my energy went on forcing myself to take another breath and keep living through this hell!Unless you like programmes that lack any real talent like Glee, then you will most likely find yourself dying a death if you go to see this film.If you're sadistic and like torturing yourself then go for it(!)

What can I say? We both adored it. It was one of those movies that you enjoy every single second of. It was full of great singers, fun characters and just the right amount of vulgar and clean humor.

383,Diabolical07,Tom Cruise in this movie is like a habanero pepper in a cheese quesadilla,7,13 October 2012,"I just watched this movie on cable. And, since I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing, I watched it again just to be sure. Here is my impression:Plot: If you expect this movie to be at all gritty, dangerous, risqué, tawdry, or in any other way accurately reflect the L.A. music scene...well, you're watching the wrong movie. If you cherish your memory of the purity of 80s rock and would hate for that memory to be destroyed or tainted in any way, it would probably be best if you didn't ever see this movie. That said, if you remember the 80s, but have since had kids or have otherwise toned down your lifestyle, and if you also secretly watch Glee and sing along to all the songs, you will probably enjoy this movie very much.Bad: Julianne Hough and Inigo Montoya or whomever that was are the infinitely unmemorable leads in this totally predictable love story of two kids just trying to make it in L.A. Their looks, acting, chemistry, and singing are simultaneously perfectly tolerable and completely forgettable. They're supposed to be the stars, but their lack of impact makes them more like backup singers. Julianne's voice sounds about 2 RPM shy of Alvin and the Chipmunks, but is otherwise acceptable. His voice is fine, but also bland.Catherine Zeta Jones seemed to be doing an SNL spoof of her own performance in Chicago. We know she can blow our hair back, so it was disappointing to see her mug it up so much in this part. Just in case she was required to do so by the director, I will blame him.Inexplicable: Is Bryan Cranston contractually obligated to be in every movie that comes out this year? Because it certainly seems like it. He didn't even sing, he just appeared for a few minutes of screen time. See you in the next movie, Bryan Cranston! Alec Baldwin was meh. He didn't subtract from the movie, but he didn't add much, either.Good: I admit I like Russell Brand. I think he has a good comedic touch, he can carry a tune, and he does both in this movie. Paul Giamatti reprises his role as Pig Vomit almost exactly. He provides the ideal dose of villain yet saves it from the abyss of being completely clichéd.Great: Mary J. Blige had a relatively small part, but sang all of her songs with enough POW to remind the audience how real singers do it. As a result, every time she opened her mouth she inadvertently blew away the rest of the cast who'd obviously been killing themselves at voice lessons. I would now like to hear an album of ""Mary J. Blige Sings 80s Power Ballads.""**spoiler**Greatest: Let me preface this by saying that when I started reading all the sycophantic reviews about Tom Cruise's performance, I thought it was a PR conspiracy concocted by Scientology and the Hollywood machine to trick people into seeing the movie. I figured the actual performance would be cringe-inducing, laughable, pitiful. Nope. Tom Cruise went for it 125% and I daresay he just about nailed it, about 90% with the singing and the rest with his balls-out performance. It seems apparent that Tom Cruise no longer cares what we think about him, and it really works for him.I don't know what remote self-storage unit he'd been storing his sex appeal in these last several years, but he definitely dug it out and had it professionally cleaned and tailored for this role. He's in fantastic shape and spends most of the movie half-naked. The result is very unsettlingly compelling, like you just realized your boyfriend's dad is really hot and now you just feel inappropriate every time you visit. Also, his singing is quite decent. His rendition of ""Dead or Alive"" and ""I want to know what love is"" in the movie were legitimately listen-able.Summary: All in all, I gave this movie 7 out of 10, but with the caveat that all 7 stars belong to Tom Cruise with an assist from Mary J. Blige. Without him, this movie has more cheese than Wisconsin and less balls than a Ken Doll. It's almost too bad that the movie's not better, because he probably won't get recognized for his performance.",Rock of Ages
384,riteword,Fun Movie,9,14 October 2012,"I'm an old goat who was, in the 80s, called the rock 'n roll Captain where I worked. My son, who just turned 34, heard this music night and day when he grew up. Last night, we saw the movie together and we both enjoyed the hell out of it, even mocking the idea of hip-hop entering a rock venue. Those looking for realism should recognize that a musical is never an actual representation of the day and most often is a parody, exaggerating and mocking its point. Rock Of Ages was just that, but in a very fun way with good music and musical centered acting.I recommend this movie because of all its elements: acting, setting, music and and plot line.",Rock of Ages

Well let me just say that I am not a fan for musical movies, but I give credit where credit is due and I was glad I watched this movie. The song list they had chosen to sing in this movie went along with the storyline and flowed throughout the movie. As for the singing, well it was spot on and delightful to listen to. Had me singing a lot of the songs with them. Each character was playing such a big role with the almost ensemble cast it seemed. Tom Cruise crushed it as the Rock Legend Stacee Jaxx it was very intriguing to see what his character would do throughout the movie. Julianne Hough was stunningly beautiful in every scene and her singing was nice as well, but it seemed she could use some better acting. Mary J. Blige was good in her role and really brought good quality to her character in the film that it made her star for her sort of little camera time.

387,lcr0224,Rock of Ages not so Solid,5,28 October 2012,"The movie Rock of Ages is a musical comedy film that is directed by Adam Shankman that focuses on a small town girl Sherrie (Julianne Hough) that arrives on Sunset Strip in Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming a singer. Upon arriving she meets Drew (Diego Boneta) and he helps her get a job where he works at Bourbon club, made famous for launching Stacee Jaxx's (Tom Cruise) rock star career. Jaxx's career is at its peak and is contemplating launching a solo career. It is fitting that he will have his final concert with his band at the Bourbon Club where his career was launched. The club is struggling and the concert is sure to bring them back to financial stability. As with any rock star there are those that do not like Jaxx's and actually want to stop the concert from taking place at the Bourbon Club. The mayor (Brian Cranston) and his wife Patty (Catherine Zeta Jones) feel that the club is responsible for immorality in the city and want to close it down. Drew and Sherrie fall in love and much of the movie revolves around their desire and aspiration for fame.Adam Shankman also directed Hairspray which I utterly enjoyed and had high hopes for this film as well. The music was done in a bit of a motif with hits from various 80's rock band. Don't get me wrong I love the 80's rock classics and they did add to the movie however the way they pieced some of them together did not flow well. A highlight of the film is the lighting it was absolutely brilliant especially in the scene where Jaxx is performing in his final concert before launching his solo career. The lighting made you feel like you was actually at the concert and they spelled out ""JAXX"" on the back wall during ""Don't Stop Believen"" while Jaxx was playing his guitar solo. The reason I rented Rock of Ages in the first place was because I enjoy musicals and Rock of Ages contains some of my favorite hits from the 80's. I did manage to watch the whole movie and but was glad that I did not waste my money to see it in a theater. The acting was just average and some of the music was ruined by the way that they mixed them with one another. So if you are looking for a glimpse back into the 80's through a sub pair romance and classic rock songs this may be the movie for you.",Rock of Ages
388,tessastmarie,Greatest Musical of All Time,10,13 September 2020,"This is the best cast in a musical of all time. Bryan Cranston, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Z Jones, Tom Cruise, Paul Giamatti, you name a better cast. And they actually sing most of the songs, the actors. And it's the funnest 80's songs ever, plus it is so over the top stupid, it is awesome. Like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Book of Mormon with none of those pesky original songs. And great production value. This needs to be a late night cult movie after Covid where we wear leather pants and bring baboons to the theatre along with Stacy Jax bourbon. Don't be an idiot. Get drunk and watch this amazin' movie. Or you are an idiot. So says St. Marie.",Rock of Ages
389,britban1,People don't enjoy movies these days.,10,8 December 2012,"I have no idea what movie the people who gave Rock Of Ages two stars saw, because The Rock Of Ages movie I saw was utterly fantastic. I HATE musicals, and have never watched one before, but this one was awesome. Tom Cruise, for the record, can compete with any professional singer out there. He was just incredible to watch. Even Alec Baldwin, who knew. We all know Russel Brand can sing, as well as Mary J. Blige, she has one of the most beautiful voices out there. For the record, Diego and Hough, are great together. Whoever says they aren't are on crack. The actors sung the songs almost better than the original singers. Plot? Who cares. This movie has such great acting and singing it is crazy how good it is compared to these trashy reviews. People have no idea what a good movie is these days. I saw this movie four times in one week, and I had to purchase it from pay-per-view. I can't wait to get the movie on DVD. I just got the soundtrack and can't stop listening to it. Right after I got done watching the movie, I downloaded all of the original songs. And they are just as good sung by the actors as they were by the originals. Whoever thinks this is a bad movie, should just stop seeing movies, because they have no idea what a good movie is, and to see any other movies, would just be wasting your money. Excellent cast. Excellent Singing. Excellent Movie.",Rock of Ages

Full of humour, 80's references and great songs.Cruise is brilliant as Stacie and totally pulls off the rock god persona.It's very tongue in cheek and has some deliberately cringe worthy moments but as a rock chick and biker bird, I just had to rock out and sing along.I have also seen the show in London and highly recommend it and in true 80's style, I threw my black lace skimpies to the 'actual' lead guitarist.",Rock of Ages

I'm not watching to be critical I want to be entertained! I was definitely entertained. Anyone that went through the eighties had big hair, parachute pants or cassette tapes has to see this movie. The acting was great and the singing was surprisingly good. Cruise and Baldwin are not my favorite people but I have to admit they did an excellent job. This movie has singing, dancing and star power. It has the love story for the girls and the eighties rock for the boys.I would definitely recommend this movie and I will watch it again.",Rock of Ages
392,eva-liz-1704,A very disappointing portrayal of what should have been fun and uplifting.,1,28 December 2012,"My family and I were excited to go and see a London Show and we spent a lot of money buying 7 tickets to last night's performance of Rock of Ages, as it sounded entertaining with lots of good music from the past. What a disappointment! It was terrible! With the material for the subject of this show, I (who have no theatrical training) could have come up with something much more creative and uplifting than this.The story line and script were so weak and so poor it was embarrassing. The acting was dreadful, as was the singing, the characters and the costumes. It was too loud and the ""singing' sounded more like a horrible noise than anything pleasant and tuneful. It was smutty, had low-life ""jokes"" of a sexual nature which had no wit or real humour, just dirty smutty words which perhaps may make those of dull wit laugh just because these words are said out loud. For me it was just embarrassing...I was ashamed and embarrassed that I had brought my family to see a show in London and it was of such poor quality.The characters looked like tramps, they said and did nothing that was memorable. Two of the actors were so dreadful that if it was in the days of Shakespeare I would have thrown rotten tomatoes at them - these were first the ridiculously silly high-pitch screeching voiced son of the portly German (who also did nothing but storm around and shout), and the awful narrator who couldn't speak properly, looked dirty, and spent his time making crude and embarrassing gyrations with his lower torso.After the first half which was absolute torture to sit through, I thought surely it can't get any worse? But it did, and the second half sank to an all-time low. The only real talent in this show came from the members of the live band but the producer of the show sadly didn't highlight their musical skills and they were more of a background feature. Instead we were forced to watch the bad actors play out the silly story-line, endure seeing them move their bodies in crude sexual ways and listen to their uninspiring words and speech. The writer and director of this show has chosen to portray this music of the past in such a lowly, smutty, dirty, uncreative way that he has in this presentation virtually obliterated any of the real artistic abilities of the musicians of this Age, and just shown it to be a time and generation of degradation, populated by low-minded, scummy, immoral and uncreative humans, only interested in crude, dirty, animalistic, lustful behaviour and filthy language. Instead of coming away feeling uplifted and inspired and cheerful, I came away feeling that I had just been dragged through a massive rubbish dump of all the worst aspects of human behaviour for 2 hours and my mind felt damaged and somehow 'dirtied' from enduring the torture of being part of the audience having to witness such a horrible spectacle of ""un- talent"" in every sphere of the production of this dreadful show.",Rock of Ages
393,Dis3a53d,Just Too Predictable,5,25 June 2012,"Sure, for what it was, it was a well made movie, but I just can't get over the unoriginality of the script.From the opening sequence, one can figure: Oh cool, a gorgeous but humbly raised singer is heading to Hollywood to find fame - I wonder what will happen!(SPOILERS)She encounters a trouble, but that's countered by her meeting an equally gorgeous and sweet fellow. Everything is going great! And then that silly thing that happens in so many teenage love stories that occur between two equally sweet people - one of them THINKS the other one did something to betray them, and instead of actually confronting them about it, they just assume they're right and ruin everything they have going for them.That's the scene where I'm pretty sure half the audience realized it was only a matter of minutes before she would join a strip club.After said stripping has been introduced, of course the boy has to realize his mistake in following the loveless fame. Cue to coincidental reunion, and huzzah for a happy ending that, like every other popular bit of entertainment today, ends with an uplifting performance of Don't Stop Believing.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to overly bash the movie. It's better than plenty out there nowadays, but I just found it astounding at how they didn't try to surprise the audience one bit. Even the songs were predictable.I enjoyed Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin, and really, everyone's voices were pretty good. So again, for what it was, it wasn't badly made, just lazily delivered.Also, I would have really enjoyed hearing some rock songs other than the ones that are on every rock 'n' roll's greatest hits compilation.",Rock of Ages
394,zoe-lee-1991,I loved this musical,9,5 January 2013,"I really enjoyed this film. Very very cheesy and cringe worthy at times but that's what musicals are all about, just a lot of fun and not to be taken too seriously. The reason I rated this as 9/10 rather than the full 10/10 is because I found Sherry's voice to be rather irritating singing through her nose and squeaky (similar to Gabriella from high school musical)which did annoy me throughout the movie but all the others singers throughout the movie were very good. Tom Cruise I found to be brilliant as Stacee Jaxx, a character very different to what i'm used to seeing him play, he had me in stitches laughing and just thought he played him really well. I'm a big big fan of rock music and for me this musical was brilliant. Cheesy but fun are the words I would use to describe this musical, I loved it.",Rock of Ages
395,darrynr-578-31742,Glee like mis-representation of 80's rock culture,1,10 January 2013,"Not a representation of 80's rock music or culture, this 'Glee' like representation from the cast is poor form and is cringe worthy. This movie is garbage and has only made a contribution towards degrading the representation of the true skid row culture of 80's rock.This poor attempt at a movie is obvious aimed at the""American Idol"" generation or those who listen to mixed compilations of generic 80's music. My friend Jagga rates the physical presentation of Julianne Hough highly and I tend to agree, but that is the only positive cast selection in this production, She only get the score of 1.Frankly, this is not worth the watch, not even if you get it for a gift; throw it in the bin prior to removing the shrink-wrap.

It is tremendously well put together...the songs are VERY well performed and it is purely fun and predictable. It's a musical...they are all predictable. A fun ride for fans of 80's rock! The predictability doesn't take away from the enjoyment of it in the least. Tom Cruise is GREAT in this and his character is a riot. I completely agree with the review that said that there could have been MORE Mary J. Blige who sings her heart out BEAUTIFULLY! Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand are very funny and have a great chemistry between them. Great choreography....from Zeta-Jones and her ladies to the folks at the Bourbon room.I really don't know how to hate this film. The characters are over the top and just right -- pure fun. Don't choose not to see this because of the poor reviews...see it for yourself, I think you'll be surprised at how easy and fun this is to watch.",Rock of Ages

I HATED this movie. I was looking forward to great acting and great music and it was all a HUGE disappointment to me.I understand it was a spoof, but even so it was hugely disappointing. Julianne can do much better than this and Tom Cruise, Catherine Zeta Jones... did you really have to stoop that low? Are you so desperate for work that you would do anything? And Alec... keep your day job! Night club singing is NOT your thing! If this was meant for the younger generation then shame on you for even going places this should never have gone for a group of teens to watch. I was, again, disappointed and disgusted.",Rock of Ages
398,acatasus,Fun? Not really.,1,24 March 2013,"A tribute to one of the worst periods of popular music. Watch Beach Blanket Bingo. It stinks but it stinks less than this. The opening scene and the song that accompanies it are interminable. You want lousy music? Find a copy of ""How Much is that Doggy in the Window"" and play it over and over for two hours and it will be less boring than this movie. There is a slight story here, but one's ability to find it depends on one's ability to survive the musical numbers. I despise disco, but the music was essential for the telling of a compelling story in ""Saturday Night Fever"" so I was able to stick with it even though my opinion of disco was not changed. In fact, by not being a fan of disco I think I was able to appreciate the movie on a deeper level than most of the disco-loving people I know. They tended to miss the whole point of the movie and believed it was a celebration of the Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge disco scene. I saw that it was a scathing criticism of that life. This film neither convinces me that the pop music of the eighties and nineties is worth listening to nor does it use the music to tell a story that moves me and informs and enriches me. Neither is it like a modern day Fred Astaire musical, a delightful meringue to get people through the depression. It just falls short in all departments.",Rock of Ages

This is a very sexy movie that imitates the time period very well making emotions from the era come back to the surface. A great tribute to 80s rock!Rock of Ages reminded me a lot of Cry Baby with Johnny Depp and made me want to watch Risky Business again, one of Tom Cruise's early 80s movies.I would recommend this movie to anybody that liked Rock music and grew up in the 80s.",Rock of Ages

I rate it right up there with American Graffiti and Grease for crowd appeal. The acting was terrific, the music fit well with the storyline and the costumes and sets really dramatized without offending. I would recommend this movie especially to the over 50 audience of whom will have plenty of memories about the rock and roll we all grew up listening to. While these songs are generational classics, a younger audience should enjoy it as well.I hope they plan a sequel to it, and look forward more modern musicals featuring classic rock of the 70s and 80s.

I saw the Rock Of Ages play in 2011 when they toured, and was excited then the movie came out in 2012. Lots of big stars in the movie, and each play a great role in taking us back to the 80's era! Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Julianne Hough, Mary J. Blige, Paul Giamatti. More movies today should be made like this.

404,JenathyMarler,This Was Fun To Watch,8,20 July 2014,"Hello! I just wanted to tell everyone that I really liked this movie musical (it took hours to get it out of my mind after I saw it). I am from Oklahoma and I only like some Country Western songs, but am not actually into that type of music, so when I found out that Julianne Hough was a Country Western singer in real life, I was pleased that Sherrie Christian was from Oklahoma, but was into the type of music that's in ""Rock Of Ages"". In my opinion Tulsa is not a backwoods town (it is a big cultural and refined city if anything)I grew up very close to Tulsa, and since there wasn't much to do while I lived in Sand Springs, as a child I enjoyed the trips that I took to and from Tulsa, Oklahoma. That all being said, I just wanted to say that I was happy to see that picture of Lita Ford in Sherrie's suitcase, but I WAS disappointed that there weren't more ""nods"" to female head bangers in this - At the time I had a poster of Lita Ford and a poster of Vixen hanging on my bedroom wall. I was thinking back to all of the other songs that could have been used in this, but then I realized that this type of music was so vast that there were way too many songs to include. I later learned which songs that had to be cut from Rock of Ages. Thank you for reading this, and enjoy the rest of the Summer!",Rock of Ages

It was a fun, energetic flashback to my high school years. Man, we dressed so much cooler. There is no real ROCK and ROLL anymore. If you hate musicals, don't see it. If you are a movie, actor, geek like me or just want a a flick to put you in a great mood and make you sing Def Leopard, Journey and Extreme for days, get it!

The ""story"" can't be more flat or stereotype (i liked it in THIS case) and if you're old enough that you really experienced this time, you maybe also want to say they raped your Songs...In my opinion the covered songs are at least greater or on one stage with the original ones. I'm from 1982, i can say i like both. They are just fun, make you feel happy and force to move! When i saw the movie the first time i was surprised that the actors sing the songs itself. Exspecially from Tom Cruise and Catherine Zete-Jones i did not expect such a good performance.Whenever i see this movie it lifts my mood and make me smile.

Frankly, I did care) and ""The Final Countdown"" strangely missing. Was the lack of sex down to the presence of Tom Cruise, though perversely he had the funniest lines in the movie? Wonder if Axl Rose has realised that Cruise's character is a wonderful p**s take of him? The leads do okay; Julianne Hough is cute-sexy but never quite captures that knowing naivety of her character. Big disappointment is Russell Brand, not really a fan of his but this was a role crying out for him to be given full rein with bit of breaking the fourth wall to engage the audience. Lends itself very much to a sing-along showing so might have enjoyed it more with an audience of 80's poodle rock fans, a song sheet and plenty of beers.",Rock of Ages

The music mixes are so incredible it really is a musical experience to hear all of that great music put together in one awesome movie.

That being said no one can say that the '80's wasn't fun...because it was! And so is this movie!This movie and the music are not historically correct in any way. The music actually spans the entire decade, not just the late '80's. It's also not consistently the same genre...but I'm splitting hairs. It has the same musical flavor throughout the film and fits the various scenes.The film is a fantasy/comedy/love story that takes place primarily in a Whiskey A GoGo replica called The Bourbon Room on a pretty amazing movie set of late '80's Sunset Strip. You can almost smell the Aqua Net lolJulianne Hough and Diego Boneta as the small town girl and city boy are appealing and fit their roles well. Their voices sound great together..The rest of the cast is a veritable who's who of Hollywood names...Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Malin Ackerman, Paul Giamatti, Brian Cranston and Catherine Zeta Jones all jump in feet first and pull out entertaining performances. Mary J Blige makes an appearance as a strip club owner and blows everyone away with her amazing pipes. There's some cool cameos of '80's stars in the film as well.Tom Cruise. Wow. Stacee Jaxx was a role that could have been a career ender. But no...Tom absolutely owns it with rock star swagger and attitude. Great job singing too...I play in hair metal tribute bands so I know how tough these songs are to sing.Last but not least Hey Man definitely should have received an Academy Award nomination lolMy one complaint is the director Adam Shankman. I get that it's a tongue in cheek comedy but he seems to approach the time and material in a way that seems almost snarky and condescending at times. I would have like to have seen this film in the hands of someone that had a higher level of respect for a time that many people enjoyed for exactly what it was...no more, no less.I lived through this time playing the music in tribute and cover bands. I hoped the movie would do the time and tunes justice and not turn it into a joke. I'm satisfied that they succeeded in conveying the sheer joy and fun of the songs in a positive way. .The bottom line on Rock Of Ages? It's not supposed to be Shakespeare. But it delivers exactly what it promises...it's Nothing But A Good Time! Rock Of Ages always gets me totally pumped up and happy by the end. See this film...and Never Stop Believing!",Rock of Ages

I knew as soon as the critics started saying they hated it, that it was the movie for me. If you grew up with the hair bands and take this for the campy make fun of the 80's lead singer movie that this is, I have no doubt you will see the brilliance. (keep in mind this was a stage show long before Glee ever came out) The boy/girl story is weak and has been told a million times, but the rest of it is awesome. It feels like Cruise channeled Jim Morrison and Axl Rose to perfection (and Im not really even a Cruise fan). The combination of Brand/Baldwin is hilarious. This movie is not meant to be the same caliber as My Fair Lady or The Sound of Music, so don't go looking for edge of your seat drama/action, go for the pure fun and enjoyment have having fun at a movie.

No, it's not Oscar material, and it's not Rogers and Hammerstein (but it is kind of Gilbert and Sullivan), but it's fun, dammit. The medleys of songs were done pretty well, and the vocals were great.
