0,SnoopyStyle,Clooney directing,5,25 December 2020,"It's 2049 in the Arctic Circle. A science station is being evacuated as an apocalyptic event spreads throughout the world. Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) is the only one staying behind since he has a terminal illness anyways. He is shocked to find a little girl left behind. Meanwhile, there is a spacecraft returning to Earth from an Earth-like moon orbiting Jupiter. The crew members are Sully (Felicity Jones), Adewole (David Oyelowo), Mitchell (Kyle Chandler), Sanchez (Demián Bichir), and Maya (Tiffany Boone). They are confused with their inability to contact Earth.This looks physically good but ultimately lifeless. In general, there are three stories being told. The flashback to young Lofthouse is rather unnecessary. It adds very little to his story. I assumed that Clooney may be trying to connect it with the little girl but that doesn't happen. The girl and Clooney hold the best part of the movie. The general premise doesn't make sense but if one ignores that, it actually works as a small adventure. There is no way that everybody would evacuate the base for certain doom. I just watched Greenland where people are killing each other for any small chance of a fractionally longer life. Having said that, one can ignore the flawed premise for the sake of the movie. That finally gets to the spacecraft section. It is the least compelling group. Clooney is doing a mix between Gravity and Steven Soderbergh's Solaris. He has great actors and wastes them with paper thin characters. It's a thriller trying to be thrilling and failing. It doesn't help that the ending is a story fading out to whatever. Only Clooney and the little girl serve as good movie material. Even there, the premise screws up the narrative.",The Midnight Sky
1,Hitchcoc,Off the Rails,6,24 December 2020,"OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this.",The Midnight Sky
2,nogodnomasters,Is there anybody out there?,7,26 January 2021,"Dr. Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) has a terminal illness and needs transfusions. He is spending his last days at the Barbeau Observatory on the Arctic Circle. In 2049 the Earth is dying and people are going home to be with their families to all die together. The spaceship Aether is coming back from K-23, a Goldilocks planet orbiting Jupiter. He is attempting to reach them to let them know not to bother coming back. Meanwhile a mute little girl was left behind and he finds himself caring for her.The film plays heavily on being with you family when you die. I am not sure if this is COVID influenced, but it made for a bittersweet story. Felicity Jones is actually pregnant in the film.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Midnight Sky
3,kosmasp,Out of this world,8,13 January 2021,"What does the future hold for us? What or where are we going to go? There are some plans I reckon, with an expiry date on this planet and/or our sun. Now this may be on the pulse right now (Pandemic and all), but also is far removed from us. At least ""geographically"" speaking.Still even though this is not close to home (sorry for the pun), it is close to the heart. You can understand what the characters go through, not just George Clooney, but the others too. There is quite a few things you can unpack here. There are many things that can be seen more clearly the second time you watch this (if you opt to do that). But there is also something the movie requires from you: Patience! This takes things slow! Which doesn't mean it isn't exciting! It is and there is suspense and tension and drama. But the pacing is quite slow to say the least, something not everyone might appreciate. Just be aware of it. The acting is superb though, casting great and while it may feel a bit too long (even for me), it is more than well done and gripping throughout (with an almost perfect ending)",The Midnight Sky
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A waste of talents.,3,22 January 2021,"I sat through Birdsong today, and I genuinely didn't think things could get any worse...... Ok so it wasn't at bad as Birdsong, this was at least beautifully acted, but as for story, tension and excitement, there wasn't any.If I could think of one word to describe this film, it would be dreary, it's just the most uninspiring, boring snooze fest I have sat through in a long time, what were they thinking?The script and story are unforgivable, I cannot find a positive thing to say about either.A waste of the talents of George Clooney, sure he's great, but performing well in a film that sucks, it's a bit like coating an organic fresh Brazil but in a cheap chocolate, why would you??I am desperate for a good sci fi horror/thriller, where have they gone?Boring. 3/10.",The Midnight Sky
5,jboothmillard,The Midnight Sky,5,28 March 2021,"I heard about this film when its producer and director George Clooney (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, The Monuments Men, Suburbicon) was talking about it on The Graham Norton Show, then it was getting recognition during Awards Season, so I had to see it. Basically, in a post-apocalyptic future, scientist Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) has been working for years searching for habitable planets where humanity could expand. After giving a presentation at a gala, he meets British scientist Jean (Sophie Rundle), they form a romantic relationship. Following a pregnancy scare, Augustine became obsessed with his work and detached from bonding with other humans, resulting in Jean leaving him. Several years later, Lofthouse encounters her again and she tells him that they have a daughter, whom he chooses not to meet. Thirty years later, in the year 2049, nuclear war has wiped out most of the Earth's population and left the surface contaminated with ionizing radiation. Lofthouse is stationed in a research facility in the Arctic; he is suffering from an unidentified serious illness that requires hemodialysis (a dialysis machine and filter to clean the blood). He refused to join the evacuation of the base, knowing he hasn't got long to live. Alone at the base, he searches the computer system for crewed space crafts to warn about the situation on Earth. He finds only one active mission: the interplanetary craft Aether, returning from an exploration of Jupiter's habitable moon K-23, which Lofthouse discovered. The mission is headed by British pregnant mission specialist Dr. ""Sully"" Sullivan (Felicity Jones) and her partner Commander Adewole (David Oyelowo). The crew has lost contact with Earth, but do not know why. Lofthouse finds his antenna is too weak and searches for another research facility to contact them. He finds he is experiencing mental blackouts. After a kitchen fire he finds a young girl (Caoilinn Springall) hiding. He tries to contact the other evacuees to get someone to pick her up, but they are all out of range. The girl is mute, but communicates through drawing, Lofthouse determines her name is Iris. He grows fond of her. Lofthouse locates another base with a more powerful antenna farther north, he takes Iris with him on a snowmobile. On the journey, they encounter a cracking ice lake, and he loses his dialysis equipment, condemning him to die soon. Arriving at the base, he manages to make contact with Aether, but the crew is interrupted by an asteroid field that damages the ship's radar and communication systems. The crew conduct a spacewalk to fix the damage. They are successfully in fixing the comms and radar but are caught in the middle of a second asteroid strike. Flight engineer Maya (Tiffany Boone) is fatally wounded by one of the rocks and dies from heavy bleeding. Sully reaches out to Lofthouse, who tells her not to return to Earth, but to return to K-23 and start a new life there. Aether's pilot, Tom Mitchell (Kyle Chandler), refuses to turn back, having made a promise to come back home. But he discovers a video message from his wife (Miriam Shor) and sees the state of Earth's atmosphere. Mitchell understands that it is in the crew's best interests to go back to Jupiter's moon. However, he decides to use one of the two re-entry vehicles to go back to Earth, hoping to find his family who may have been evacuated to temporary safety. Fellow astronaut Sanchez (Demián Bichir) saw Maya as a second daughter, decides to accompany Mitchell and bury her body. In her final communication, Sully tells Lofthouse that he was one of the reasons why she joined NASA. She thanks him, telling him her mother Jean knew him, and that her full name is Iris Sullivan. Lofthouse says he already knew her name, making it clear that the young Iris he saw was a hallucination. When asked how he ended up at the base he contacted Aether from, he says he thought he might be able to help someone, hinting that the reason that he kept track of Aether's mission was not just to help them to turn back, but also because he knew Sully was his daughter when he looked at the crew details. Before heading out into the cold unprotected to die, Lofthouse tells Sully he's proud to have finally met her and Sully describes K-23 to him. Sully and Adewole set a course to K-23, provided to them by Lofthouse, to give humanity a second start. Also starring Ethan Peck as Younger Augustine, Tim Russ as Mason Mosley, and Eysis Clacken as Rachel. Clooney as the terminally ill scientist is good, Jones, Owelowo and the others are also good as the astronauts, and Springall is a good young actress. Clooney has crafted a film with two interesting survival/adventure stories, one in the freezing wilderness and the other in the claustrophobia of space, both are filled with eye-catching moments, with fantastic special effects and a great music score, slightly predictable at times, but overall, a satisfying science-fiction drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat. Worth watching!",The Midnight Sky
6,paul_haakonsen,Ultimately way too mediocre...,5,26 December 2020,"This movie was hyped pretty fairly up, so I must admit that I was expecting something more than what writer Mark L. Smith and director George Clooney managed to deliver.Now, I am not saying that ""The Midnight Sky"" was a boring or bad movie, but I just feel that the movie had the potential to have been so much more in both entertainment value and story. It felt like it was just the tip of the iceberg that was used to make the movie. And it was a shame, because the concept here definitely had a lot of potential.For me it was the prolonged uneventfulness that sort of put an anchor around the movie and held it back. The first two-thirds of the movie just trotted along with much of anything particularly impressive or overly entertaining happening. Sure, this was to establish the story and characters, but two-thirds? It just dragged on for a bit too long. And then the movie exploded into action, but ending as abruptly as it set into action, which left for much to be desired.The storyline was adequate and definitely had a lot to offer, but sadly weren't utilized to its full potential, making for a somewhat meager and mediocre movie experience. Sure, the movie was watchable, but it was not a movie that had me thrilled or impressed. Nor is it a movie that hardly warrants more than a single viewing for me.""The Midnight Sky"" definitely had an impressive assembly of casted actors and actresses, but sadly they weren't given space to spread their wings and showcase the full scope of their talents, given the limitations of the script and storyline.Visually then ""The Midnight Sky"" was definitely an impressive movie, but again there weren't a whole lot of things going on in the first two-thirds of the movie, but if you sit through the last third things definitely pick up.My rating of ""The Midnight Sky"" lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars. A watchable movie for sure, but hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable movie experience.",The Midnight Sky
7,CinemaSerf,A high end example of science filching,5,17 December 2020,"There are shades of John Barry in Alexandre Desplat's suitably galactic score here, but that is, sadly, about all I can say that is good about this derivative sci-fi yarn. I think George Clooney did just about everything but make the coffee as his terminally ill character traverses the arctic wastes to reach a weather station. It might have a transmitter powerful enough to contact an approaching space craft returning from a distant planet that may offer hope for the survival of mankind from some sort of ghastly existential event threatening the world. The ship is manned by a crew including David Oyelowo and a pregnant Felicity Jones but their journey home is made even more perilous by being knocked off course and having to travel through uncharted space - full of dangerous meteor showers. Money has been spent; and it certainly looks good but the two stories don't really gel/relate very well; the characters are very under-developed and the plot is reminiscent of half a dozen other films of this genre where money was no object but poor writing, directing, and to be honest - acting too, wasn't part of the priority either. It's got way too many long beauty shots, spaceship shots, arctic shots - even gun shots - anything, really, to distract us from the lack of a new story. The imagery certainly benefits from a big screen, the rest - from being on the radio!",The Midnight Sky
8,grantss,Heaps of potential but goes nowhere special nor profound,5,26 December 2020,"It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist. He is determined to contact any off-planet travellers from Earth to warn them of the disaster and see if they can help. Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing.",The Midnight Sky
9,ferguson-6,snowstorms and spacewalks,5,22 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Screenwriter Mark L Smith has described his adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's book, ""Good Morning, Midnight"", as a cross between the Oscar-winning GRAVITY (2013) his own THE REVENANT (2015, nominated for 12 Oscars). It's a lofty comparison, and unfortunately, one that doesn't prove out. Two-time Oscar winner George Clooney takes on the dual role of director and lead actor, and it's his first movie role since 2016's MONEY MONSTER.Clooney plays Dr Augustine Lofthouse, a renowned scientist, and the only one staying behind as everyone else evacuates the Arctic Observatory after some unspecified ""event"" as left the earth uninhabitable. Augustine has a terminal disease (also unspecified) and evidently decides to stay behind because he likes drinking alone and self-administering blood transfusions. The drinking alone fun ends when he ""finds"" a stowaway young girl named Iris (Caiolinn Springall in her first film) and must assume the role of father-figure. To complicate matters, Iris doesn't speak.It's 2049, and the film cuts between 3 storylines. While Augustine and Iris and working on a survival plan, we get flashbacks to a time when he was a younger scientist (played by Gregory Peck grandson Ethan Peck) and sacrificing a relationship with Jean (Sophie Rundle, ""Peaky Blinders"") to focus on his career. The third story occurs simultaneously with Augustine and Iris, and involves Aether, a manned spacecraft on a years long mission to determine if Planet K23 can be inhabited by humans. The crew is commanded by Adewole (David Oyelowo, SELMA), and includes his partner, a pregnant Sully (Felicity Jones, THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), pilot Mitchell (Kyle Chandler, ""Bloodline""), navigator Sanchez (Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT), and rookie astronaut Maya (Tiffany Boone, ""Hunters"").When Augustine learns of Aether and its route back to Earth, he takes it as his responsibility to inform them that they need a new plan. In order to do this, he and Iris must trek across the frozen Arctic tundra through a blinding snowstorm to reach the satellite equipment that will allow communication with Aether. This road trip through a whiteout allows for the best effects during the Augustine/Iris section. Aboard Aether, the crew is relatively non-descript, but there is a spacewalk segment that is quite something to watch thanks to the cinematography of Martin Ruhe. There is also a visually interesting segment featuring blood in zero gravity.So what we have is a three-piece post-apocalyptic science-fiction space survival tale with a surprise twist that won't surprise anyone. It's likely meant as a warning about how we are destroying our planet, and global catastrophe may not easily be solved through space exploration. The film presents an interesting symmetry between the vast wasteland of Arctic winter vs the vastness of space ... neither seem to have borders or boundaries, yet are fraught with dangers. If you pay much attention to the story, you'll likely be disappointed; however, if you watch for the visuals, you should be fine.

I shouldn't have though. I was expecting the worst but after watching The Midnight Sky I can only conclude I was entertained for almost the entire movie. I agree there are a couple unnecessary scenes but overal the rest wasn't bad at all. Okay it's not George Clooney's best movie but it's watchable. The movie got nominated at the Oscars for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. It didn't win, and even though the visual effects were good, there was still better than this one for this year. I can only say you shouldn't pay too much attention to the reviews rating it the lowest possible. Those are from people that watch five to ten movies per year.

12,FeastMode,netflix produces garbage movies,1,19 June 2021,"I can't do it any more. Almost every time i watch a netflix movie, it's the same feeling: pointless. I am a self-proclaimed movie fiend. I watch hundreds of movies each year. And yet when it comes to having any kind of intrigue, netflix is completely incompetent. How many times can they make a movie fiend ask himself ""why am i watching this?""as to this specific piece of netflix garbage. It's two parallel stories with some connections, but they're not dependent on one another. The characters might be (not really) but the stories are not. With a couple tweaks, each can be told without the other. So rather than feeling like one big story with two parts, it feels like two different movies. Neither of which are the least bit interesting or entertaining.I can't understate how boring this movie is. I had to force myself to finish it. They did an awful job of making me care. At all. About anything. Or anyone.The only thing of value here is some cool space shots. The end.I forgot to mention how many things it tried to steal from the GOAT movie Interstellar. Key word tried. For anyone who thinks this movie is good, i implore you to watch Interstellar. You will no longer consider midnight sky a movie (1 viewing, 6/18/2021)",The Midnight Sky
13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Pretentious, boring ego trip of a film",4,11 January 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOn a virtually uninhabited, post apocalyptic Earth, Augustine (George Clooney), a lone man, lives on the wreckage of an old space craft. His existence takes a strange turn when he discovers Iris (Caoilinn Springall), a young girl without any parents. When Augustine learns a ship, crewed by Sully (Felicity Jones), Adewole (David Oyelowo) and a few others, is heading towards Earth, he must race to send a signal to warn them against their course, but the voyage may have more of a personal connection to him than he thought.There are those that warm naturally to celebrity culture, and lap up everything their favourite stars have to say, and there are those that get quite irritated, and voice their annoyance at their 'virtue signalling', as it's become known in common parlance. George Clooney is known almost more for his activism than his acting, and here stars and directs in this apparent piece of climate change propaganda, a big, self indulgent drag that goes nowhere fast.As a lone survivor trying to exist on a desolate earth, Clooney and shortly there in his young co star don't naturally have much to say, and so silence and atmosphere are all that there is certainly to carry the first half of the film, before we are introduced to the secondary characters on board a little later on, while we soak up some back story of Clooney's character. Sadly, we fail to develop any emotional connection with any of them, and thus it's harder to care what happens in the course of their journey, leaving us to struggle through it for two hours.It's one saving grace is some beautiful cinematography, of beautiful mountain ranges in an arctic landscape. But sadly, a big name cast giving it their all can't make this any less of a chore to sit through. **",The Midnight Sky
14,Cineanalyst,A Lonesome Apocalypse for the End of 2020,6,24 December 2020,"While set in the future of 2049, ""The Midnight Sky"" seems a depressingly timely release for this pandemic year of 2020. The world is ending... in the movie, for reasons unexplained except that they were caused by man--global warming, nuclear holocaust, or any number of cataclysms of humanity's hubris. It doesn't really matter the exact event for the purposes of the picture, with the result regardless being one of character isolation and regret. George Clooney's scientist is confined to traveling between arctic radio bases, to stay in front of the poisonous air circling the world and to communicate with astronauts secluded in outer space. A lot of quarantining inside and otherwise wearing protective equipment to avoid breathing in the dangerous outside, in other words--sounds familiar, right.Apart from that, this is another Clooney space movie, with him directing as well as starring this time, and which is unfortunately closer to the ""Solaris"" (2002) remake than it is to ""Gravity"" (2013) (I haven't seen ""Tomorrowland"" (2015) yet). It's derivatively competent, but hardly of the import that its big-budget apocalyptic and planet-hopping scenario demands. Playing with memory is promising material, and this is reflected in space by the virtual-reality programs that remind the astronauts of home and on Earth by the scientist's flashbacks. It's readily cinematic: the film-within-the-film virtual reality and the flashbacks necessitating montage. The space mission and the one on Earth further reflect each other even in the space walk and the earthbound journey through snow-swept landscapes. Remembrance and regret is also intertwined with the dying planet and, perhaps, that of the human species (at least, one presumes, without biblical levels of inbreeding). But, it's been done better before in other space-related pictures, such as, say, ""Arrival"" (2016), or the original ""Solaris"" (1972). Moreover, it's disappointing that these recollections don't amount to much more than forgiving a man for abandoning his daughter.",The Midnight Sky
15,851222,A terrific science fiction movie with ideas and characters at the center,10,25 December 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.More then once ""The Midnight Sky"" (2020) reminded me of ""Interstellar"" during its 1 h 50 min run time. Similar great idea, performances, craftsmanship. Yet I still prefer ""Interstellar"" way more, because its simply is the best science fiction ever made in my personal opinion.But back to ""The Midnight Sky"" - I found this movie very involving. I did not knew the story nor synopsis - and this story and the way it was told kept me engaged during its whole run time. I love good science fiction, and this movie is one of those. But at the center of everything most important things in this movie I think was its idea, and characters. Its hard to talk about them without spoilers, so I will not. The ending was surprising, and very touching and good. Sacrifices that one makes in order of something grater and last chance to say goodbye to ones we love and being with the during final moments I think its at core of this film.

16,The-Sarkologist,"Pointless, Directionaless, Boring",2,26 December 2020,"Like, there is a way of making a film in which absolutely nothing happens, and there is a way of doing it quite well. Samuel Becket and Harold Pinter were masters of the genre. George Clooney, unfortunately, isn't. Mind you, I'm not entirely sure if this is what he was trying to get at, but honestly, this movie was just really, really boring. In fact, for most of the time I was just willing it to end, and to end quickly. If there was a point in all of this, I really don't have any idea of what it was.Basically it is about this scientist in the arctic trying to contact this ship that was travelling to Jupiter to check out this planet to see whether it is habitable, but on the way the Earth basically destroys itself. The whole point is attempting to tell them to stay where they are because there is nothing for them to return to. And it is basically two entire hours of this. In fact, there are scenes that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, such as why does he leave the base only to return - there is no explanation, and no reason. Also what is the purpose of that girl he finds - she just seems to be there to provide a person to talk to, even though she doesn't say a word for the entire film.Honestly, I'm really going to have to stop watching these straight to Netflix films (though there is a suggestion that this was a theatrical release, so I'm really, really glad that I didn't go and see it in the cinemas). Yeah, in a way it is pretty bad, and my recommendation would be to save yourself two hours, even if you are doing something while it is playing in the background (you'll pretty much get the gist of the film watching it this way anyway, since much of it doesn't really make all that much sense) and watch something completely different - maybe four episodes of Ash vs The Evil Dead.",The Midnight Sky

After a mysterious global catastrophe the only chance of the survival of humans is that group of astronauts.I had high expectations from this movie and I was a bit disappointed by it due to many filler scenes that were absolutely unnecessary and destroyed the flow of the movie. The direction which was made by George Clooney, it was average because even though I have not read the book that ""The Midnight Sky"" is based on I can understand that in a two hour movie it is very difficult to use all the material you have from a book. The interpretations of David Oyelowo who played as Adewole, Felicity Jones who played as Sully and George Clooney who played as Augustine were all very good but their interpretations were not enough to lift this movie. Finally, I have to say that ""The Midnight Sky"" is a nice movie that had the potential to be amazing but failed, despite that I believe that it worth watching it.",The Midnight Sky
19,cruise01,An uninspired sci fi space exploration film that lacks about everything.,5,7 January 2021,"2.5 out of 5 stars.The Midnight Sky is a pretty boring science fiction film. About a space crew called Aether led by Felicity Jones. David Oyelowo. And others are set out to explore a possible habital moon by Jupiter. Which is colorful and beautiful. And habital. But they lost all communication with everyone back on Earth. While on the arctic circle. George Clooney stays behind on a station when everyone evacuates cause the planet is becoming difficult to live cause of the air is worsening. He finds a girl played by Caoilinn Springall. Which they set out on an adventure across the ice to reach a satellite station to communicate with Aether about Earth no longer being sustainable.The plot is decent. With not much going on with the script that has the characters facing challenges. Some thrilling parts with George Clooney trying to get out of a breaking ice cap. Or the space station crew coming across an asteroid wave that has them floating in space was amazing and breathtaking. Otherwise, the film is boring. Concept like this seems similiar to other sci fi films like Interstellar which is by far superior.The film lacks thrills and excitement. Even an emotional connection with the characters. The music score is tedious. The film is beautiful to look at with the cinematography work of the arctic landscape. The moon planet they explore. And the space sequence with the crew outside the ship was breathtaking. The concept is over done. And story is dull and flat.George Clooney is decent with the character. The cast ensemble are all decent with forgettable characters.It is one space science fiction film that leaves you feeling flat about everything else with the movie.",The Midnight Sky
20,eddie_baggins,Another dud for Clooney the director,2,15 February 2021,"A once promising directing career that started off well with cult film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and went from strength to strength with the Oscar winning Good Night and Good Luck, George Clooney's stints behind the camera have petered out significantly in the years since his first two films with misfire comedy Leatherheads, wannabe Oscar baiter's The Ides of March and The Monuments Men and the dire Suburbicon all painting a picture of a career as a director that was and still is in serious dire straights.Not helping this situation in the slightest is Clooney's latest venture behind the camera, the Netflix backed The Midnight Sky, a film that also see's him dial back the kilos and grow an impressive old man beard to play the leading role of sickly Arctic scientist Augustine Lofthouse in this sombre and dull sci-fi drama that squanders a potentially exciting and thrilling affair as it progresses along its self-important road.Visually Sky is one of Clooney's most intriguing films yet (got to use that Netflix money somehow), with ample space action and some stunning CGI shots of a snow blasted landscape or outer space rubble events but these visually appeasing occurrences throughout the film are relatively few and far between and fail too make up for Clooney's mostly lifeless direction and character building that makes you wonder very early one why you should care about anyone or anything going on in this supposedly deep thinking tale.Covering three separate plot lines that includes Lofthouse trying to do his job in the midst of a global catastrophe, Felicity Jones astronaut Sully and her crew who are returning from a multi-year mission of exploring other planets for civilisation and a dalliance back in time when Lofthouse was nothing but an upstart scientist with grand ideas, Sky struggles to balance all its various components, that portrayed properly could be compelling and gripping but here are nothing more than bores that at times skew far too much into mawkish territory to sit well (here's looking at you space repair singalong).Perhaps most pressingly for the film and working to help its eventual quick detriment is the wasting of its talented cast.Clooney is gruff and uncharismatic as Lofthouse, Jones is given very little too work with in here space screen-time and supports like the talented David Oyelowo and Kyle Chandler may well have not shown up as the likeable performers all get drowned out by a dreary production that never appears to fully comprehend what it wants to be or what it wants to say to its audience.Final Say -A dull Netflix offering that is but a further painting of the picture of Clooney's failing career as a director, The Midnight Sky is a mismanaged attempt at human focused Sci-Fi that even the most hardcore of genre fans will find hard to enjoy.1 flicked pea out of 5",The Midnight Sky
21,Tweetienator,How to Make Even the Apocalypse a State of Boredom,4,25 December 2020,"Production and acting are solid, that's on the plus side, on the con side: a very slow and rather boring story told. This of course makes the movie almost unwatchable - but if you want to be tempted to dip fast into the arms of Morpheus (ancient god of sleep) The Midnight Sky might do, but in the case that you want entertainment and/or something to feed your mind, it won't work. Also the twist with the girl is rather obvious within a couple of minutes, you just have to use your brains, assuming your brain-cells should still work and not be in sleep mode till you figured it out. Anyway, The Midnight Sky is a Netflix production like (too) many: hire some known actors, put some money into the production and technical staff and voila you got a new movie. A good script!? An interesting story? Suspense? Entertainment? Emotions (to get emotions you must care about those people you watch)? Nada. Not important at all these days it seems. My rating is 4, but only because of the decent production value and the sometimes fine visuals.",The Midnight Sky

Another example is the meteor shower. Where was the radar? Then they have a second meteor shower??????? The list of mistakes is long.The other problem is communication between a space ship near Jupiter communicating with Earth in real time.

24,marmar-69780,The Midnight Sky,7,14 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky is a new film directed and acted by Clooney and i will say that he did a better acting job here then a directing one,mostly because this film has a feeling of mixing Gravity and some other films of same type and because of that it didnt felt like nothing new or original at all.In acting he was good and better then his previous roles in history,i still think that his best role was in Gravity and here he showed some signs of that performance.Rest of cast was good but their characters were unexplored and without personality .Midnight Sky is a fine film but it doesnt distant itself from other films similiar to this one",The Midnight Sky
25,southdavid,Glacial Pace.,4,4 January 2021,"Lured in again by a bit of buzz and some star names, again I come away disappointed with a Netflix movie. ""The Midnight Sky"" George Clooney's first staring role in four years and first directorial appointment since ""Suburbicon"" in 2017 feels like not just one, but two disappointing films welded together.Set in the near future, following an unspecified nuclear disaster that leaves most of the planet engulfed in radiation, a dying scientist, Augustine (George Clooney) decides to stay at a remote arctic communications base. He was previously part of a mission to send exploration rockets into space looking for inhabitable planets. The last of those rockets is on its way back to Earth, its small crew eager to report their positive findings. Augustine desperately tries to contact them, to tell them to turn around.Whilst I wouldn't say that ""The Midnight Sky"" was without merit, the performances are pretty solid, and the visual effects are good, it's all let down by its two stories, both of which are underwhelming and derivative.Augustine's story sees him and a small girl, Iris, charmingly played by Caolinn Springall, traverse the dangerous arctic tundra towards an even more remote communications relay, which may still be operational. It's nothing that you haven't seen before and done better in films like ""The Revenant"" and contains a twist so painfully obvious I can't believe there's anyone that wouldn't have seen it coming. The other half of the story is equally unoriginal, it has more star power though, with David Oyelowo, Felicity Jones and Kyle Chandler serving on board the returning exploration vessel. They have general ""Gravity""-esque problems on their trip back. You can learn all you need to know about these characters from the fact they sing ""Sweet Caroline"" at one point and don't belt out the ""Daa-Daa-Daaa"" bit. Monsters.Technically sound, but dull and sorely lacking in originality.",The Midnight Sky

27,paul-allaer,Ambitious sci-fi space opera falls flat,5,25 December 2020,"""The Midnight Sky"" (2020 release; 118 min.) brings the story of scientist Augustine Lofthouse. As the movie opens, we are at ""Barbeau Observatory, the Arctic Circle"" and it is ""February 2049, Three Weeks After the Event"". Something is ravashing the globe, a virus or radiation of some sort, and people are evacuating the observatiry, except Lofthouse who is staying put for some reason. Frankly he looks depressed and/or ill. He notices that the spaceship Aether is approaching earth after a 2 year mission to/from a Jupiter moon, and he tries contacting them to stay away from earth... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after 4 years away from the big screen, George Clooney returns to produce, direct and star in this ambitious sci-fi drama that is the movie adaptation of the novel ""Good Morning, Midnight"" by Lily Brooks-Dalton. I haven't read the book and hence cannot comment on how closely the movie sticks to the book's plot. But what I can say is that the movie, despite all of its super-expensive production sets, never really takes of and just meandors on and on without really going anywhere. There are stretches in the movie that do nothing to advance the plot and simply seem to be there to add some much needed ""action scenes"" (cue: space walk scenes to repair the Aether), except that some of these scenes seem to be lifted straight from ""Gravity"" (also starring George Clooney). It is just baffling. Clooney, sporting a heavy beard, looks much older than he really is, and he looks very tired and ill throughout, as if something is very wrong and off. Felicity Jones plays Sully, on the Aesther spaceship. One of the best things about this movie is the original score, courtesy of Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat. But in the end, this movie simply falls flat, despite its $100 million production budget.""The Midnight Sky"" opened in select theaters 2 weeks ago and soon will be shifting to Netflix only. The Christmas Eve theater screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (4 people in total, including myself). This movie has simply tanked at the box office, pure and simple. Of course if you are into sci-fi and space movies, or are simply a fan of Geroge Clooney, I'd readily suggest you check it out for yourself, and draw your own conclusion.",The Midnight Sky
28,wandernn1-81-683274,I Been Thinking. Well That's Your Mistake.,5,3 April 2021,"Primarily about we have people in space in some kind of space station and when they come back to Earth , Earth is dead or dying anyway.It took me a while to figure out exactly what was going on. And I guess the premise is that Clooney's little girl is one of the astronauts on the ship thats returning to EArth. And Clooney is one of the last survivors on the dying Earth. And he'll never get to see his little girl again. It's a good story and not badly told. It just doesn't have that much UMPH to it.When I think about space movies with UMPH , recently I think about Gravity or 2033, which i liked a lot also. You want a good oh darn we aren't getting back to the planet movies, pull out Event Horizon. Or if you really want to open the floodgates of tears then watch Nolan's.

29,alindsay-al,An Above Average film with a poor ending,6,4 January 2021,"This film came to Netflix late last year but I have now had a chance to watch The Midnight Sky and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a a scientist in the arctic attempt to stop a crew of astronauts returning to Earth.Main Character
George Clooney plays the lead role and is the director of the film and he deserves credit for that and he does an alright job in the film. It isn't the charming and charismatic performance you usually see but Clooney does give a decent physical performance and he is a pretty harrowing character when more is revealed about him. Felicity Jones plays the head astronaut and she is good here, I wasn't expecting to see so much of her but was pleasantly surprised as she is a good character and I thought she was a good contrast to Clooney's stuff happening back on Earth.Supporting Characters
David Oyelowo plays another astronaut and is also good, the chemistry between him and Jones is solid and it seemed that they were having a good time in playing their roles. The rest of the astronauts are good too and I thought they were a nice group together and I liked there bond and thought it was well presented here. The other few members of the cast are solid too including a good performance from a little girl who has to do more work then you would expect.Story
This is where the film falls down though, it's story is really bad and doesn't do enough to keep you interested at all. It is like somebody wanted to make a survivor movie and somebody wanted to make a sci-fi movie and they couldn't make both so they put them together and created this hot pot of a messy story. It doesn't help that the end of the film is super anticlimactic and it kind of feels I wasted 2 hours with a story that went nowhere.Script
The script actually surprised me, I thought the film was going to be really dramatic and it is at times but I was surprised by the quick and funny dialogue between the astronauts that saw them bantering a plenty and it made them a fun group to watch. But that drama does fall flat towards the end of the film where it doesn't make you care about anybody and again as I said it leaves you questioning why you bothered.Style
The film looks good, the space scenes stand up when needed and the winter scenes on Earth do the job very well too and it is just a nice film to look at. But there is an issue with pacing here, it doesn't help that the contrasting tones of the two plot lines clash, the film is also really slow in the first 30 mins and it took quite a bit to get me back somewhat on board and plenty of people will have checked out by that point.Overall
Overall, I heard this film was terrible but I actually found it above average and a fine watch. It has some decent performances and good look that is an okay watch, I wouldn't rush to watch it but I thought the film was okay.",The Midnight Sky
30,CubsandCulture,It has a unique set of concerns but dramatically flat,6,29 March 2021,I think hard sci-fi fans might get more out of this movie than I did. I liked it overall but the film has no real momentum. The event that destroyed the world need to be fleshed out a little more as well. With that said this is a really unique story for a sci-fi film. It combines an family drama with space exploration with post-apocalypse with a survival tale. The various scenes should not go together but the script and Clooney-as director-do bring a unified film together. The space stuff was pretty good on a technical level and I loved the scenes on the Jovian moon. Overall this is a film that has a lot going for it but it is too leisurely for its own good.,The Midnight Sky

Coming back from a planet that we hoped would be our future. I have to warn them about the conditions on Earth.""Visually stunning and hauntingly contemplative, The Midnight Sky is a meditation on mortality and humanity that's strikingly shot, and beautifully assembled but lacks full depth in its themes and characters, still ultimately delivering a wonderfully fascinating sci-fi film that's engaging and provocative. Score: 83Discussion Points:
Far out this film looks and sounds gorgeous. The cinematography, sound, score, visual effects and production design are all off the charts! Clooney as a director is pretty solid here. Nothing too incompetent nor revolutionary, just solid filmmaking. His performance is gruff and rough and something I've not necessarily seen from him before. The rest of the cast does well with what their given, but that's the films biggest weakness. It's got some great themes and it really angles itself to try and ruminate on humanity, mortality and loss but it just never quite gets there. It's sadly disjointed in its narratives jumping from Clooney's bleak survival crusade to the mysterious spaceship ensembles quest through the unknown. The strongest narrative threads are the quieter moments with Clooney that are bleak and resonate but he's seemingly determined to spend more time not on himself and rather on his actors whom he elicits strong performances from. Regardless of its narrative flaws, this is still a very accessible and engaging sci-go endeavour and I frothed on it.",The Midnight Sky

35,Pairic,Arctic & Space Thriller,8,27 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky: Augustine (George Clooney) is an astronomer who searches for habitable planets. He's in the Arctic at an observatory in 2049 when an Event occurs which kills much of the Earth's population. When the base is evacuated Augustine stays, he hasn't long to live due to a terminal illness. Heck! He could outlive the rest of humanity as they seek shelter under ground. But a young girl Iris (Caoilinn Springall) is left behind, Augustine now has to look after her. Returning from Jupiter is the spaceship Aether, It has confirmed that one of Jupiter's moons is suitable colonisation. But it cannot contact Earth, is unaware of the catastrophe which has struck. Augustine hears a broadcast from astronaut Sully (Felicity Jones) and is determined to communicate with the Aether and so heads off with Iris to another base which has a more powerful antennae.So two odyssey's begin. Augustine and Iris traverse the Arctic ice and tundra; discover a crashed plane , mysteriously full of objets d'art, encounter wolves, brave ice-breaks and the freezing temperatures and blizzards. The astronauts have to deal with an environment even more deadly with equipment failure and space debris strikes. Some great shots of the Aether which looks as if it came from a fusion of Discovery One (2001) and Valley Forge (Silent Running). Tension in both space and the Arctic build as as they approach their destinations.Some great acting from Jones, Clooney and Springall (who remains mute for most of her screen time). Augustine also reflectys on his past life and in flashbacks we see how he lost the love of his life, Jean (Sophie rundle) another scientist, due to his obsessive devotion to his work. The chemistry between Clooney and Springall sparkles when his reserve breaks down and they flick peas at each other. Not just Science Fiction or another apocalypse movie. This is a story of lost love, a lost world, new bonds and some plot twists which you'll have to unwind for yourselves. Directed by George Clooney and written by Mark L. Smith (Overlord, The Revenant) . On Netflix. 8/10.",The Midnight Sky
36,andrewchristianjr,VISUALLY INTERESTING BUT BLEAK.,6,22 February 2021,It was probably too long with a lot of gazing and musing by Clooney and the rest of the cast.

The Midnight Sky is a wholly forgettable, unremarkable snooze of a film saved only by the visual effects which earned it an Oscar nom. The two competing stories of a crew on a ship and old man winter trying to get something feel entirely disparate and not only did I soon find myself not caring but found that when put together in whatever hodgepodge amalgam they were forced into I somehow cared less.Harsh as all that may sound, I don't think this is an awful movie it's just aggressively uninteresting and the cool set designs aren't enough to save it from that mediocrity. Fortunately, it won't be long before this has slipped my mind entirely and I can devote brain cells to more fascinating things, like watching the grass grow outside my window.",The Midnight Sky
38,dierregi,Lamest disaster movie ever,1,29 December 2020,"Sick scientist Augustine is - probably - the only survivor of an unmentioned catastrophe that wiped out Earth's population. The five - extremely politically correct - crew members of a spaceship are - possibly - the only other human survivors and Augustine must stop their return flight to the Earth from K-23, a habitable moon of Jupiter.Sounds very dramatic but it isn't. The plot moves at glacial pace - appropriately, because Augustine is stuck in the Arctic. On the good side, Clooney plays old and sick convincingly, sporting an unkempt and unflattering white beard, an ever more unflattering crew cut, dark under-eyes bags and a sallow complexion.That's the only convincing thing in the movie. The ""perilous events"" that endanger Augustine's journey from one Arctic station to another are contrived to add drama. The same applies to events on the spaceship.Not even the presence of a child and of a pregnant astronaut (surely the pinnacle of #MeToo + PC) manages to produce a tinge of real emotion. To make matter worse the ""message"" of the movie is reactionary: we'd better take care of our families rather than wasting time being prize-winning scientists. This is dumb, because very few can be eminent scientist while everybody can have a family.",The Midnight Sky

George Clooney's direction is also great, it's well filmed and well paced. The CG is mostly good but has some weak moments and the music by Alexandre Desplat is really good.",The Midnight Sky
40,jadepietro,Reaching Out,8,24 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: Despite all the lavish showmanship, two stories seem to be caught in a parallel universe in this doomsday drama.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED): In George Clooney's well-crafted sci-fi drama, Augustine Lofthouse is a scientist and loner, a man consumed with space travel and the cosmos. Stationed in the Arctic and dying of cancer, he chooses to stay behind for his last days while all others evacuate for safety during a global disaster. He is alone, except for a mute stowaway girl named Iris who becomes his charge. Meanwhile, a space mission is returning from Jupiter and all transmissions from NASA have mysteriously ceased. Augustine decides to risk his own safety and warn the astronauts not to return to Earth due to apocalyptic circumstances that have doomed their home planet. What we have here is a failure to communicate...not in the film's epic grandeur or in its ambitious vision, but in its fragmented storytelling. The two frontiers never merge seamlessly in this mediative look at life and death in our possible future, but there is still much to admire.Mr. Clooney stars and directs this saga and he does impressive work in both creative areas. Sporting a massive grey beard that David Letterman would envy, the actor gives a poignant performance as this solitary man. His story-line is by far the most compelling, but the film cross-cuts to the space mission which is rather predictable and listless in its pacing. As a director, Mr. Clooney knows how to create action and tension most effectively, and he counteracts those moments some strong poetic symbolism, aided by Alexandre Desplat's lovely melancholy score. He wisely plays down the heroics and hones in on the human drama, although his flashbacks of a younger Augustine lack credibility due to casting issues and further undercut the flow of the narrative. This is no criticism to the acting talents of Ethan Peck (grandson of Gregory)...the actor just has no physical resemblance to the easily recognizable screen persona of a younger Mr. Clooney.Mark L. Smith's screenplay tries to supply his space traveling characters with some depth, but their backstories is conventionally told and lack any element of, dare I say, gravitis. We've seen these action figures in umpteenth space odysseys battling obstacles on perilous missions. Nevertheless, the cast (Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Demián Bichir, Tiffany Boone, and Kyle Chandler) do fine work in their sketchy parts. While the outer space CGI and the absolutely stunning camerawork by Martin Ruhe, plus Jim Bissell's superb production design provide the wow factor, it's those blizzard white-outs and tundras scenes that have the emotional impact. Moviegoers get the treat of visiting these two ""polar"" opposite worlds. But though we can reach for the stars, it is the snow and ice that we prefer to endure.The Midnight Sky is an adventurous and thoughtful undertaking by Mr. Clooney and his artisans. This is a stunningly good-looking movie that would have benefited in a wide screen moviegoing experience than the smaller (and more common) streaming capabilities in this year of COVID.",The Midnight Sky

Just putting people on a spaceship doesn't make something science fiction. It means the writer thought it was 'cool'. The lack of science in this movie is appalling. It's even worse than the ""Oh my god, this fierce wind storm will make us evacuate Mars"", in the Martian. (Check some science Andy, you might have thought it cool, but mars atmosphere is too thin.) The Audience never finds out what made humanity extinct. Cloony seems to sleepwalk through his role AND they use a cliche common in 1950's Science Fiction, while on a spacewalk, one of the astronauts is injured and of course, dies. Wow. That took some deep thought, didn't it? This is just another terrible movie that critics went ga-ga over. I wonder how many of them watched this drek rather than stared at their cell phones because honestly, some reviews of movies that are absolutely horrible - well, that's my only explanation.

50,IonicBreezeMachine,"It won't be for everyone, but The Midnight Sky is a haunting meditation on humanity, its legacy, its connections, and its drives to survive.",9,26 December 2020,"Augustine (George Clooney) is a terminally ill scientist living in seclusion at an observatory in the Arctic Circle after an event has rendered much of the planet uninhabitable and killed off much of humanity. While looking at the skies via his observatory he sees the Aether spaceship on a return course from Jupiter moon colony K-23. With the current circumstances on earth the Aether remains unaware of the dangers posed by returning which spurs Augustine to traverse the Arctic wilderness to find a transmitter capable of alerting the crew and saving their lives.Based on the book Good Morning, Midnight by Lily Brooks-Dalton and adapted by Mark L. Smith and directed and starring George Clooney, this was easily one of my most anticipated films of 2020. I'm pleased to say that it met my expectations.The movie is absolutely gorgeous with not just top quality special effects creating gorgeous scenes on K-23 or the Aether spaceship, but also the Arctic wilderness yielding sequences that are as beautiful as they are imposing. Luckily there's also a very human story to go along with the eye candy.Clooney is very good as a man near the end of his life who has resigned himself to the fact that he is now alone and without purpose. We see flashbacks involving his relationship with a woman named Jean and how he came to where he is. It's a terrific performance and it's backed up by a story that touches an emotional core that gives it validity. The characters on board the Aether aren't as developed as Augustine's character and we never do any deep dives into their characters like we do Augustine's, but there's a good sense of camaraderie among the crew that makes them feel believable and likable.With that said however the movie will not be to everyone's taste. The Midnight Sky is a slow burn with many scenes being based around establishment of the mundane in the desolation of the arctic or aboard the Aether. In that way we, the audience, in many ways are giving tours of these environments and they are visually interesting and have a tangible quality that makes them feel more real and authentic. Despite being post apocalyptic, there's very few ""thrill"" moments and it's more an analysis of how people cope with extraordinary events of a world shaking nature. I personally felt a level of emotional resonance to this film that most films fail to do these days, but I realize that for those who don't like slower movies that are more based on atmosphere and introspection than dialogue and plot will dislike this film and understandably so. However if you are able to work up the patience to sit through a movie that is not afraid to take its time, you'll find a movie that isn't afraid of tackling the emotional weight of its story, but also ends on a pitch perfect note that while not the happiest of endings does leave a feeling of optimism in humanity that leaves you believing we are worth it we will continue on.The Midnight Sky is one of my favorite films. While it's somewhat slow pace will be off putting to some and it's sequences focusing on the mundane may not resonate it's a unique take on big budget sci-fi that focuses on the humanistic elements that are often lacking in its more action orientated cousins.

53,petra_ste,Two decent movies in one... but they don't gel with each other,6,29 December 2020,"I like the premise of The Midnight Sky a lot more than its execution. Oh, it's competent; the solemn cast does a fine job with rather thin characters.The problem is structure, as this film ambitiously features two intertwining but wildly different plotlines.In the first, Augustine (Clooney), an aging astronomer with a terminal illness, chooses to remain behind when most mankind leaves Earth facing an ecological disaster, as he desperately tries to contact the returning spaceship Ether and warn them not to land on Earth but to continue their journey. As a further complication, Augustine finds out he is not alone: a young girl has been left behind.The second plotline follows the crew of the Ether, with pregnant Sully (Felicity Jones) and her companions, who ignore what happened, struggling to survive the return journey and contact Earth.I believe Clooney has described the film as a mix between Gravity and The Revenant. Sounds interesting, right? It is, sort of, but the two storylines are so disparate in setting and pacing, they don't really work together all that well.As we get invested in Augustine's struggle to survive in the wilderness while taking care of the girl, we suddenly jump to the astronauts facing an asteroid swarm - then we jump back to Augustine, and tension just whooshes out of both storylines.This strange cross-genre exercise required REALLY tight writing and editing, but doesn't fully deliver. It's passable, but instead of one visceral story like in either Gravity or The Revenant, we get two half-hearted ones mixed together in an intriguing but flawed hybrid.6/10",The Midnight Sky
54,bankofmarquis,Moody and Atmospheric,7,26 December 2020,"Ever since his stint on ER, I have been a fan of George Clooney's - and not just because he is charming and charismatic on film - but because I find that he brings an interesting facet to whatever character he inhabits.And with his latest effort THE MIDNIGHT SKY (Directed by Mr. Clooney, as well) he does not disappoint as his performance - and his Direction - are fascinating to watch.Based upon the novel by Lily Brooks-Dalton, THE MIDNIGHT SKY tells the tale of a lone scientist (Clooney) in a remote, arctic research station, who is one of the few remaining people on an Earth that has become uninhabitable. He rushes to warn some returning astronauts to avoid their home planet.A thoughtful, moody film. THE MIDNIGHT SKY will not be everyone's cup of tea - and you have to be in the mood for something somewhat slow and contemplative - but if you are, you will be rewarded with a rich tapestry of visuals and performances that will be, ultimately, fulfilling.Let's start with what works - George Clooney. His direction and his performance as Augustine, the scientist, are both sparse and compact. Neither of these facets have an extraneous movement or tone and they work hand-in-hand to deliver the film that Clooney, obviously intends to give us.Visually, this film is beautiful to look at - inter cutting the vast emptiness of space to the vast, snowy emptiness of the Arctic. The images that Clooney was able to create was well worth watching this film for.Clooney was also fortunate enough to cast a variety of stellar performers in a film that has very few roles, so the ones that are there better deliver the goods - and they do. From Ethan Peck (Spock in Star Trek:Discovery) who plays the young Clooney in a flashback (I am very glad they chose to do this as opposed to ""de-aging"" Clooney) to the Astronauts: Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo (who I continue to like more and more every time I see him), Kyle Chandler and Tiffany Boone. All strike the right tone for the moodiness of this film.Special notice should be made for Damien Bechir's astronaut, Sanchez. He was terrific in the limited screen time he had and elevated every scene he was in. Bechir has become one of those performers who I get excited about when I see that he is going to be involved in a screen project.What doesn't work? Well...as I stated before...the pacing. It is slow (almost coming to a stop) at times. Since this is a film that will be streamed via Netflix, I can see many, many folks grabbing their phones at times, which is too bad, for the moodiness - and pace - worked for me (or at least the for the mood I was in while watching this).My other issue with this film is the contrived circumstances that both Clooney and the Astronauts find themselves in. It isn't enough that Clooney has to journey across rugged Arctic terrain to find a more powerful antennae to communicate with the Astronauts, we have to throw in cracking and melting ice to it. And, of course, just as the Astronauts connect with Clooney, a surprise meteor shower damages the communication array. These contrivances just wasn't need for the type of movie this film was trying to be. It's almost as if the Studio Heads said ""it's too slow and talky - put some action in this thing"".But, if you are able to stay with this film, the ending pays off very well, indeed. I found that it earned it's ending and I walked away moved and satisfied.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",The Midnight Sky

60,Snootz,One of the best,9,1 January 2021,"When I see the overall viewer rating of 5.6 and see a review titled ""Nothing happens. Ever""... it is obvious there are a lot of people who simply do not understand slow-burning, cerebral fiction. Perhaps Transformers would be more to their liking.This is one of the best sci fi movies I have ever seen. It has very little action, no giant monsters or robots, no over-the-top fight scenes or space battles. This is about individual people dealing with a worst-situation scenario... and from the very beginning to the last after-credit symbolic sound effect, this offers excellent writing, directing, acting, and production.It has one of the most effective dramatic scenes I have ever seen in a movie (I won't go into details and spoil it). George Clooney was almost unrecognizable in his role of an elderly man struggling during his last few weeks of life. The spaceship crew is minimal in number, none with incredibly significant roles or overly-emotional drama... just people going about their assigned tasks until that moment when daily life becomes extremely demanding.This film had me glued, every minute to the very ending. I've seldom seen such effective story telling... if one is willing to sit and pay attention to the story being told rather than demanding their personal expectations of what science fiction should be. Like the odd Russian film ""Stalker"", this is slow and deliberate and meaningful. Go in with that realization, and one can find a rare gem of a film in this otherwise adrenaline-fueled world.",The Midnight Sky
61,kuarinofu,Underrated emotional story about life choices and redepmtion,8,27 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky is definitely a good but flawed emotional story.I think it's not as bad as other reviewers say.The production is great, the film looks pleasant and sounds even better.Story-wise it's predictable but still well done.Perhaps many people didn't like the film because they have nothing to draw a parallel with. In my case, I understood the main character's experiences and memories. The theme of mistakes, loss, and redemption is straightforwardly revealed.It seems to me that everyone has those things that haunt them for the rest of their lives.I guess it was easier for me to understand him because in my life I often pursued my career path by rejecting a loved one and making mistakes that I couldn't forgive myself later.I especially enjoyed Sophie Rundle's acting and I wish the film shifted its focus to their backstory instead of showing the specifics of the repair process of a space antenna.I cannot agree with people who say that nothing happens in the film, a lot actually happens, but not in the real world, but in the lives of the characters and in the experiences of the protagonistOverall, 'The Midnight Sky' is an excellent emotional tale that imprinted itself upon me and I enjoyed that. The film is very reminiscent of 'The Road', 'Ad Astra' (thematically), and even had some elements of 'Sunshine'.If the movie had been shorter and spent less time on details (especially since the production allowed you to believe in this world without having to throw in extra specifics) it would certainly have been one of my favorites.Recommended for more mature and self-reflecting audiences and people who often delve into themselves to face the consequences of their choices as they age.",The Midnight Sky

63,Darkside-Reviewer,An absolute waste of time!,4,25 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky sounds like it has an interesting storyline when you read the movies synopsis on Netflix. ""In the aftermath of a global catastrophe, a lone scientist in the Arctic races to contact a crew of astronauts with a warning not to return to earth."". This brief synopsis makes the movie sound like it's going to be story about a man who travels across the Arctic at the end of the world in order to warn a crew of astronauts who are returning home from a mission not to come back to earth but to instead turn back around and return to a newly discovered habitable planet in the hopes that the human race will survive through them.The movie doesn't know what it's trying to be it's basically a mash up of different genres. The first quarter of the movie is quiet and focuses on one character at the end of the world who ends up meeting a little girl who doesn't talk. Then by the half way point the movie turns into a survival thriller about a man and a little girl travelling across the Arctic fighting off wolves and surviving the cold. His trip across the Arctic takes only about twenty-five minutes making what was meant to be the whole point of the movie rushed and hardly touched upon. The third quarter of the movie takes place in space and suddenly the movie turns into Gravity by focusing on characters space walking trying to fix the spacecrafts communication array. Then in the final part of the movie it's just the characters deciding should we land on earth or go home they decide and after a very weak and pointless twist in the story the movie ends.This is meant to be a post apocalyptic movie where George Clooneys character is one of the last humans left alive on earth. The movie takes place in the Arctic and in space so we never see anywhere else on earth just snow and empty space that's it. So what ended the world you might be wondering well your guess is as good as mine because it's never explained or even touched upon once in the entire movie it's infuriating.There is very little character development throughout the entire movie by the time the credits role you know just as much about the movies characters as you did when the movie started. George Clooney is pretty much the only interesting thing about this movie he does give a great performance as a dying man at the end of the world but sadly that doesn't make the movie any better it just makes it tolerable to watch.There are some very nice looking shots of space which are again very similar to the movie Gravity but that's only for about twenty minutes of the movie the rest is just snow and cheap generic looking sets that make up the rooms in the spacecraft.I don't recommend watching this movie it's boring and uninteresting which is a shame because if it had a bigger budget and bit of script rewrite it could of been better but as is it's just enough cheap Netflix movie by a once good actor who lost his charm after Batman and Robin failed.",The Midnight Sky

When it's not George Clooney walking around in the snow with a little girl, it's a bunch of austronauts talking and doing astronaut stuff, and it's rarely interesting.And when it's none of that, it's flashbacks of who I guess it's supposed to be young George Clooney, but hilariously looks nothing like him.Also, what was that ending?!Clooney is good and the visuals are often impressive, but I can't imagine myself sitting through this again, unless I have a very bad case of insomnia. In conclusion: boring.",The Midnight Sky
65,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,26 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky, a new film directed by the star George Clooney, is more than a science fiction set on Earth and in space. In fact, because it takes place simultaneously in both places, the feature that arrived on Netflix can be considered more accurately as a reflective drama that seeks to address human themes above science. It is interesting how the work, adapted from the book Good Morning, Midnight, touches sensitive points that are very much in vogue today, even though the tone is much colder than expected.History does not bring up urgent themes because, in this fiction, the planet Earth has deteriorated to the point of becoming uninhabitable to any type of life. Scientist Augustine (Clooney) is the protagonist and the center of the whole plot, because at the same time that he goes through a ""quarantine"" on Earth, he needs to get in touch with the other part of the cast - a group of scientists in space - to warn them not to return to their homes because they don't even exist.Film directed and starred by George Clooney tells two stories that intersect without much impactIt is unclear how much time has passed since the Earth collapsed definitively, without giving one last chance for people to solve their ecological problems. We spectators imagine that such an irreversible scenario may have happened abruptly, but The Midnight Sky works on this scenario that an absurd tragedy may have happened in the not-too-distant future. With Augustine's flashbacks, her normal life was similar to the one we live in today.It is nevertheless interesting to see this parallel of the film with our current reality, in which global warming is increasingly on the agenda and various measures to protect nature are increasingly necessary in society. And while Clooney doesn't openly show how the entire global tragedy happened, he turns his own film into a message that the planet needs to take a different direction. By setting a scary and not-so-fanciful example, The Midnight Sky takes on even more striking contours.However, it is inevitable to note that the two parallel plots (that of Augustine and her journey of reflection, and that of scientists who are aimlessly in space) do not connect so well. In this way, the film gains two types of messages and tries to balance the particular with the universal, but this causes the central theme (which would be Earth) to be lost.The beautiful photography, the special effects and the consistent direction of Clooney are positive points of the work, but the use of flashbacks that only make sense in the last act is a tool that evidences a somewhat cliché story. As there is no support between Augustine's plot and the team of astronauts led by Sully (Felicity Jones), The Midnight Sky has more strength when the film is analyzed from the point of view linked to our own reality, and not so much through fiction molded between the lines.I liked this review of the AdoroCinema website.Film seen on December 25, 2020.",The Midnight Sky
66,MrDHWong,Borrows heavily from better sci fi media and yet barely anything noteworthy results from it,4,7 January 2021,"""The Midnight Sky"" is a science fiction film directed by and starring George Clooney. Based on the novel ""Good Morning, Midnight"" by Lily Brooks-Dalton, it borrows heavily from better sci fi media and yet barely anything noteworthy results from it.In 2049, scientist Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) has chosen to remain on his own at a research base in the Arctic after a major disaster wiped out most of humanity a long time ago. One night, Augustine discovers a young girl named Iris (Caoilinn Springall) inside the base and despite his reluctance, decides to take care of her like she were his daughter. Some time later, Augustine receives a radio signal from the manned spaceship ""Aether"" who inform him of their intent to return to Earth, but due to poor communication relay, Augustine is unable to reply that there is nothing to come back to. With not much time remaining, Augustine and Iris travel across the Arctic Circle to find somewhere better to send a warning to the Aether before they discover the terrible truth.Films dealing with the future of mankind and the current state of the Earth are among my personal favourites. I've always found it fun but worrying to speculate on what actions humanity will inevitably take once we've used up all of our resources and need to find somewhere else to call home. ""The Midnight Sky"" does seem to follow these types of themes but makes them about as interesting as watching paint dry. Not once did I ever feel invested in this film's story, mainly due to the slow, tedious pacing and bad editing that came from situations involving underdeveloped characters and scenes that went nowhere. It seems the film couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be straightforward sci fi adventure or a philosophical introspective drama and instead tried for both but failed miserably. Scenes involving the main character traversing the harsh Arctic terrain were awkwardly interspersed with moments of the spaceship's crew trying to figure out what to name a pregnant member's baby. This made it near impossible to adjust to the film's tone and it takes viewers like me out of the whole experience because it's so poorly executed.Admittedly, the film is at least nice to look at. I did admire some of the creative shots on the Arctic base Augustine was calling home, as it cleverly emphasised how he was the only human left there, showing a large mess hall area with only him as its main diner. Also, there was a scene that showed the perspective of one of Jupiter's potentially habitable moons which featured the gas giant rising up like the sun. Unfortunately, all of these memorable visuals were only at the beginning and for some unknown reason there weren't any more later on in the story. Again, this likely due to the poor use of editing that affected the pace of the film and left nothing else of interest worth mentioning. This is a shame as I could definitely see the potential this film had for being an atmospheric treat for the eyes had it stuck with that the whole way through, rather than blowing it all in the first act.The cast were about as good as one would expect, with George Clooney holding the audience's attention in the surprisingly limited screen time he has in the lead role. If it were anyone else I may not have cared otherwise, mainly due to Clooney being one of those actors with an uncanny ability to make even the most underdeveloped characters fun to watch. I liked his interactions with the young Caoilinn Springall as Iris, which made for some decent father/daughter bonding moments. However, none of the performances of the Aether crew left that much of an impression me. Each of the cast could have been played by anybody as neither of the actors brought anything special to their roles. This made scenes on board the Aether drag on longer than they should have as I just did not find myself caring at all for what they were going through and had me wishing there were more moments with Augustine back on Earth.As at has little to offer that previous sci fi films haven't already done, ""The Midnight Sky"" is simply not worth the time. The entire duration, I found myself wishing I was watching something else, like ""Interstellar"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", as those films are the best examples on how to do this genre correctly. If you haven't already, then I recommend checking those two out as soon as possible. This film, on the other hand, don't bother.I rate it 4/10",The Midnight Sky

Well, some of that is almost insulting because the references are so obvious and even come from some of Clooney's previous films. I am not sure if that was lack fo creativity or laziness. There are at least the stories and concepts of 5 famous films involved in this one. That fact makes it really hard for me to give Clooney's newest feature a positive score even if you can see how ambitious he was with this project and you got to respect that too of course. The film ended up a bit messy and went kind of nowhere. That is sad because its own concept is actually very good and the first third of it was also very promising and had a lot of potential. Also the actors are good. George Clooney plays the lead, not being afraid to show his age, and he does it very well. Good performance for sure. I also liked Felicity Jones who yet gives another strong performance. David Oyelowo was a bit wasted but Damiea Bichir and Kyle Chandler gave good supporting performances. There is a wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat and some incredible visuals. So yes, all what is needed to have a big winner picture at hand.

How can this film look so beautiful yet be drowned in loneliness & sorrow?! George Clooney does well portraying the main protagonist in this. He is stationed in Antarctica & there is also a crew of astronauts in space. The film switches seemingly between both of these & orbits around to a satisfying conclusion.Whilst I was watching this I felt that something was amiss & can confirm the ""ending"" was guessed right. I see the metaphor for the distance or journey apart between George's current predicament & that which he longed for most in the skies. The thing that is out of reach is something unexpected but heart warming or devastating depending on one's perspective. It poses the question what a genius may have to give up for one's work & as they grow old is that which they sacrifice worth it over their legacy?!!",The Midnight Sky
71,ronakkotian,The visuals are great but the same cannot be said about the story,5,31 December 2020,"It's been a long time since we've seen a new George Clooney movie and now we finally have one with him directing and starring in it but unfortunately it is a misfire.The Midnight Sky takes place during the year 2049 where the world has gone through a global catastrophe. Augustine, a lonely scientist in the Arctic, races to contact a group of astronauts to tell them not to come back to Earth.It's great to see George Clooney in a new movie after four years and sure enough he gives a very strong yet poignant performance as Augustine but the entire movie overall is pretty boring. Starting off with the positives, The Midnight Sky is a very gorgeous looking movie. The visual effects are very well done and it's evident a lot of work went into space scenes and the icy world of Earth. Apart from the visual effects, there isn't much else that makes this film that memorable. There have been superior sci-fi films in the past that have done what The Midnight Sky tries to do better. The film starts off well but the story fizzled out quick due to the very slow pacing and lack of events. The writing is pretty poor as Clooney's story and the astronauts' story don't gel well together. Clooney's story is the most interesting out of the two but sadly so much focus is put on the astronauts that I began to lose interest. The space crew storyline is so familiar to other sci-fi movies and the lack of character development made it quite dull. It's also disappointing considering how the crew had great cast members like David Oyelowo, Kyle Chandler and Felicity Jones.As mentioned before, George Clooney is great and easily the most interesting part of the film. Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Kyle Chandler, Demián Bichir and Tiffany Boone all do a decent job despite the lack of material for their characters. In her debut performance, Caoilinn Springall does a pretty good job and her scenes with Clooney are the most engaging.Overall, The Midnight Sky is a disappointment.

73,Aylmer,Under-baked scifi you've likely already seen,3,27 December 2020,"This one looked intriguing as a combination of the old German sci fi drama OPERATION GANYMED (several astronauts returning from a mission to find a destroyed Earth) and a touch of AD ASTRA and GRAVITY jumping from one crisis after another with some slow emotional pondering here and there. Well, even with the niftiest effects in the world, it managed to be an even less fulfilling experience than any of those films, owing to the film frustratingly dragging out explaining anything about what is going on until so late in the film that you won't even care any more.Clooney directs with suitable gusto and most of the performances are at least okay (if a little generic). The film has basically no sense of humor nor much of a sense of tragedy either as it strains credulity on many occasions. The most ridiculous instance for me had to be when a character is submerged in frozen arctic water only to come out and put a coat on and be fine. Anyone who has lived in the Arctic will tell you that simply falling in the water and getting out can be a death sentence, even with a warm-up shelter and fresh dry clothes at the ready.There's a few mystery threads that get answered toward the movie, one of which (involving an identity of a character) will be absolutely spoiled by the captions if you watch with them on. Another big twist makes so little sense it'll make you wonder if the whole movie was just a hallucination (and no, it's not supposed to be that kind of movie).It's a shame that so much work looks like it went into the production but almost nothing went into the (at-first intriguing) script.

75,andrewroy-04316,"The Midnight Sky is technically impressive but ends up being a meandering, poorly written amalgam of sci-fi stories",5,9 January 2021,"I don't think The Midnight Sky is a bad movie - aside from the weak dialogue, it has a clear and simple premise and sticks to it, with strong technical elements. Instead, its biggest problem is that it doesn't know what it wants to be - an astronaut journey film like Gravity, a character-driven movie via sci-fi ideas like Ad Astra, a mix like The Martian, or something else. There really isn't a larger message to the movie or any themes that shine through, which seems to be the biggest reason audiences dislike it. The closest the movie comes to having a point is in analyzing Augustine's character, and I did not find that to be particularly effective. The flashbacks simply don't add much and the twist with Iris does not tell us anything at all about his psychology - it's just a twist for the sake of it (sure, he's thinking about her, but he's literally never met her. Meaningless). The visuals are excellent and Desplat's score is very good, but it ends up feeling like a mash up of various styles with no thematic connective tissue. I don't regret having watched it, because it is fairly ambitious and I like the premise fine, but the script is really quite weak and Clooney ultimately needed to focus the film more into clearly being something specific.",The Midnight Sky

77,PyroSikTh,There's a Good Movie in Here Somewhere,6,24 December 2020,"Clooney is Augustine, a tired old man dying of cancer stationed up in the Arctic circle when an apocalyptic ""event"" occurs, bathing the globe in deadly radiation, and forcing humanity underground. Except for Augustine, because he's dying anyway. He stays up top to keep an eye on the sky. In his youth he discovered a new moon orbiting Jupiter, and theorised that it might even be a suitable place for human colonisation. Thirty odd years later and the space mission Aether has been sent to investigate, leading the way for the first space colony. Unfortunately Aether has been out of contact with Earth since the event, and on their return trip have no idea what's going on. Augustine must race to a nearby radio station in order to send out a warning to the Aether crew, urging them to turn around.Midnight Sky is two completely disconnected stories running concurrently with one another, and it suffers for it. On the ground we have Augustine contending with the harsh Arctic conditions, dragging along a small girl that was left behind, trying to stay ahead of the radiation creeping up from the south. This takes up a hefty chunk of the film's first half, but he and the girl arrive at the radio station about halfway through the movie, and take a backseat to the Aether crew. The second half of the movie takes place almost entirely in space. The Aether mission has to contend with a lack of communication from Earth for reasons they're unaware of, but we the audience know full well. Then they get shifted off course somehow and must course correct by flying through an uncharted section of space, leading them through clouds of ice debris that requires a spacewalk to repair. This disconnect between the two storylines inevitably results in one being more interesting than the other. We spend an hour or so with Augustine and this little girl, become endeared to their relationship, grow in suspense as they struggle through blizzards and fending off wolves. And then they're gone and we're stuck with a group of characters we barely know, and we have to go through that whole escapade of getting to know them again before we can become attached. When bad things happen to them, it's hard to care, because we just want to see more of Augustine and the little girl.Pacing isn't the only problem with the story. It's also rife with inaccuracies and events that stretch the suspension of disbelief to its limit. The worst culprit is the Aether half, which plays out more like a space fantasy than the grounded sci-fi drama it wants to be. There's no reason given for what punts them off course, and the idea of uncharted space being a problem kind of irked me. Space is largely empty, that's why it's called space. The chances of them running into something dangerous is extremely unlikely. But guess what, this is a movie that requires stakes to remain exciting, so they bump into two dangerous clouds of ice debris! Not so dangerous that it annihilates their ship though, just enough to cause an inconvenience. And their collision detection doesn't pick either of them up, so how they got all the way to Jupiter in the first place eludes me. The arctic half isn't immune to this though. There's a scene where Augustine wakes up in a sinking outpost and has to save as much as he can before it's lost to the icy depths. Apparently freezing cold seas in the arctic, at night, isn't enough to kill him off from hypothermia though. ""Well at least he doesn't have to worry about the radiation or his cancer killing him off any more"" is literally something I said out loud afterwards.So why does the movie follow two disconnected storylines? Is there a thematic connection? A twist that reveals a connection later? Yeah, kind of. There's definitely the framework of something about children and a hope for humanity here. Augustine has this lost little girl tagging along, one of the Aether crew is pregnant with another little girl, and Augustine often flashes back to a relationship he had when he was younger that gave him a little girl he refused to have any part in raising. There's little girls in all three segments. I'm not really sure what the connection between them is though, because no point is made about it. They're just there. Sullivan's pregnancy was also purely a result of Felicity Jones being pregnant during filming as well, so it's clear there was no real plan to connect any dots here, especially when the big twist connecting the stories together hits in the film's final moments. Yes, you've guessed it, Augustine's daughter is one of the Aether crew, and the little girl accompanying him was just a manifestation of his guilt in not being a part of her life growing up.And after all this, the movie just ends. Half the Aether crew fly down to Earth on a suicide mission, as they have no co-ordinates of where to go to reunite with their underground family, deliberately condemning humanity in the name of suicidal sentimentality. Augustine stares out at the sunrise completely alone waiting for the radiation, or his cancer, to finally take him. And Sullivan heads back to this inhabitable moon to have her baby, where humanity will live on for maybe another fifty years or so until she dies and we're truly extinct. But apparently, that's something to be hopeful about?This movie needed tightening up in the script and the editing. There's a good story here. There's the framework of a good message, the twist could slap hard if it wasn't portrayed so predictably, and either the bleakness could've driven home the doom of humanity, or exemplified ways of keeping us going with that colony ship they mention in passing. The scientific inaccuracies I can live with, because it's a movie. It's pure fantasy, and I recognise that sometimes things have to be bent in order to remain a compelling watch. That said the Aether crew flying through ice debris was completely pointless anyway, and could've been cut entirely in order to assist the pacing and reduce the runtime a little. In fact splicing the two stories together a bit better would've done the film a lot of favours, rather than focussing on just one at a time.I'm remiss to call The Midnight Sky a bad movie though. Maybe that's my sci-fi bias streaking through, but I still found a lot to enjoy about this movie. As I mentioned, the premise is really good, and following Augustine and this little girl as they bond and race against multiple clocks was great. Clooney's acting is really strong as well, almost single-handedly carrying the entire movie on his back. The score by Alexandre Desplat is really good; tense, emotional, and knows when to lighten the mood and add some levity to the otherwise depressing story, and of course the visuals are gorgeous, especially those of the Aether (although the surface of K23 looked like it was ripped straight from a space fantasy from the 80s). I give The Midnight Sky an okay 6/10. I found enough in it to enjoy, but I recognise there's a lot of problems that will annoy a lot of people.",The Midnight Sky
78,ebeckstr-1,"Some good moments, but serious script issues",6,28 December 2020,"The greatest strength of this movie is the casting. Every role is perfectly cast, and there is excellent chemistry between the characters. This chemistry, combined with the dialogue, lead to wonderful moments of personality and relationship development, especially among the space crew. It's actually sort of remarkable how efficiently and quickly these characters become differentiated from each other, and how likable they become in such short order. I was especially glad the script writer didn't include the kind of infighting and drama you often see in movies like this. They're just a bunch of likable people, clearly friends with each other, doing their jobs and enjoying each other.On the other hand, this well-intentioned movie is also marred by serious issues with that same script. As other reviewers have pointed out, the science is unforgivably inaccurate. There is not some deus ex machina, suddenly-discoverable hidden moon of Jupiter that happens to be habitable as we are supposed to buy within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There is no such thing as artificial gravity. It is ridiculous that there would be any portion of space between Earth and Jupiter that is unmapped. It takes more than a few days to get from Jupiter to Earth, and this movie does not seem situated far enough into the future to account for the technological leaps necessary for some of these plot holes to be filled. These are the kinds of gaffs one might expect from an ill-informed movie made in the 1950s. If these kinds of leaps are going to appear in a movie made in 2020, then it needs to become a Star Wars-type science fantasy, rather than be presented as some kind of modern, realistic science fiction drama, as this movie is.Finally, Midnight Sky also can't seem to decide what kind of movie it wants to be, an earth disaster or an action space disaster movie. The crises that occur in space are contrived, and belong in the likes of Space Cowboys or Armageddon.While I think people are being too hard on it when they give it fewer than five stars (one or two stars is ridiculous - there's too much good casting, good acting, and good dialogue for a score that low), more than six or seven stars is giving it too much credit.",The Midnight Sky
79,Draysan-Jennings,Visual Melatonin,5,23 December 2020,Can't sleep? Put this movie on. It will knock you right out. What a let down. I was really looking forward to watching this movie. The trailer looked great. Too bad it turned out to be flat out boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did. And what was up with that ending? The two lone astronauts pushing buttons as the credits roll.. strange.. I was also confused on why the two older male astronauts headed back to earth. Everyone was dead and the planet was unliveable. Call me crazy but maybe going with the other astronauts to restart the human race was a bit more important. When it was all said and done I was pretty disappointed. Definitely not what I expected from a film directed by George Clooney. 5 stars C- grade.,The Midnight Sky
80,sweidman-28016,It's Halfway There,5,30 December 2020,"""Been thinking a lot about time... and how it gets used and why. Why one person lives a lifetime and another only gets a few years.""George Clooney directs this year's space movie about Augustine, a lonely scientist in the Arctic in post-apocalyptic Earth, as he races to stop Sully and her fellow astronauts from returning home to a mysterious global catastrophe. Nobody knew what to expect from everything that was given to us. George Clooney doesn't have the best track record with directing and just much of anything as of late. From the trailers, though, we were promised a stunning looking movie with a thrilling plot and some good dialogue. But then looking at the writer Mark L. Smith, he's been lucky once with The Revenant and nothing else. Needless to say, nobody knew. And because nobody knew what to expect, I think that's why not many people sought out to see The Midnight Sky. There are things that I like about the movie and things that I make me think this isn't a very good movie.For starters, this is a gorgeous looking movie. The dynamic settings make for a good production design. Even in the Arctic setting where not much is happening, it all looks appealing. Then add the beautiful color scheme and the cinematography makes it so much better. I'm personally a big fan of the Arctic setting against the Northern lights. Just everything on Earth in general are my favorite parts, both visually and plot wise. In space, I'm more focused on the visuals. They're good, but a few times they fail to make me believe and therefore take me out the scene. In a year where we lacked the great Hollywood, visual effects movies, this does stand out as some of the best.On all levels except for production value, The Midnight Sky fails to deliver. I found it quite boring. Even with Earth coming to an end and the race against time, the sense of urgency felt low. If this was intended to be a character driven movie, I felt nothing for the characters. George Clooney's character felt nonchalant the whole time. That goes for all of them. Nothing felt thrilling. The acting is at least good by them and we get some good dialogue at times. I think this boils down to direction. A different director could've taken on the project for it to reach greater heights. Clooney had an eye out for the visuals side of the story but lost focus on story and characters. I'm very torn with The Midnight Sky. I think it was halfway there. They got the right idea but the execution is where everything lost touch.",The Midnight Sky
81,akcenat,"Ultimately, ""The Midnight Sky"" is too much and too little",6,19 January 2021,"Film like many other entries in its genre, boasts impressive technical bells, with cinematography that creates some stunning visual effects. But, despite the considerable efforts involved (and George Clooney as main character/director) the question remains, all this to what end? Was the planet destroyed by nuclear war, ecological disaster, etc? Who was responsible-which governments, military forces or other parties? We are left entirely in the dark. Also, after 45min into film runtime I got little bored. The spaceship crew is composed (just) by OK actors, yet in away all their characters unfortunately felt somewhat hollow and generic while Felicity Jones love connection with her partner (David Oyelowo) feels underwelming. It's only when the whole crew come together to sing ""Sweet Caroline"" in which I felt convinced of some crew connection. In addition, main problem of the movie is its inability to make a strong connection between the separated stories. At the end, film is not a movie with overwhelmingly spectacular qualities and whilst proving visually stunning, I can't help but shake the feeling that ""The Midnight Sky"" is weighed down by a sense of self importance, much like the similar ""Ad Astra"".Rating: 6",The Midnight Sky
82,stevenrotherforth,Looks a million dollars and then some!,7,18 March 2021,"The Midnight SkyA wonderful science fiction from actor/director George Clooney.
'The Midnight Sky' is available on Netflix and looks a million dollars.
Actually no, it looks considerably more.
I don't know the actual budget of this movie but I have to say that this is one gorgeous looking movie with some spellbinding special effects.
Clooney is a capable Director and some of the cinematography offered here is jaw dropping.
Best viewed in Dolby Vision, 'The Midnight Sky' is elevated by the use of High Dynamic Range.The story follows a lonely scientist who must warn returning Astronauts not to return to the dying Earth.
Everyone else as evacuated the planet leaving Augustine (Clooney) to fend for himself.
This is a slow burn movie for the first two thirds of the runtime.
I loved this films sombre approach and recommended the film to my brother.
He wasn't as impressed or should I say as patient.
You need to let the plot unfold.
Clooney allows the story to tell itself with a fantastic performance by him and the young Caoilnn Springall.
The film plays out from two points of view.
Those on Earth and the returning Astronauts led by Felicity Jones.
Anyone familiar with the movie 'Gravity' which also stars George Clooney will see a resemblance to that film.
Almost as if Clooney had taken inspiration from past efforts.
A certain scene involving blood in zero gravity is wonderfully crafted.
Horrific yet beautiful at the same time.
The imagery is 4K crisp with CGI looking particularly impressive.
This is one of the slickest looking movies available on Netflix.
HDR accentuates the infinite black of space against the contrasting white of the spacecrafts exterior.
This movie is one for all you OLED owners out there.
There's also a nod to 'The Martian'. The scene where Felicity Jones' character is left behind on a gorgeously colourful alien planet is pure eye candy.In terms of audio quality 'The Midnight Sky' offers a sumptuous Dolby Atmos sound mix.
It plays out rather subtly until LFE is needed.
Then there's real authority to the audio delivery.
With impressive object based effects, this movie benefits from such quality sound, drawing in and immersing the audience.I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Midnight Sky'.
If you are of a patient nature and allow yourself to be absorbed by the wonderful cinematography and technical qualities of the filmmaking then the story slowly captivates.
This movie is a credit to the Sci Fi genre.",The Midnight Sky

85,coreyjdenford,Midnight bland,6,23 December 2020,"The year is 2049 and the Earth is dying after a global catastrophic event that has lead to great evacuations and mass extinction of not just the human race but of animal life too. With just that plot alone, it's oddly similar to Sunshine or other films that destroy Earth after some sort of disease. Though that doesn't make George Clooney's third film as a director any less watchable instead the only thing that's missing to make the same as Sunshine, is one; director Danny Boyle and two; well, the drama. Not that The Midnight Sky is a bad film, far from it, though it won't be to everyone's taste, it's just the film's narrative gives us quite a well structured wall, but the wall is constantly bombarded by drama that should punch you in the chops but with particularly non-descript characters, the drama fails to hit. Granted director-star Clooney does grace the film with a rather poignant performance as a terminally ill lone doctor as he advises scientists not to return to Earth in risk of death. At its best, the film is stunning to look at with its fantastic sci-fi visuals, that at a glance would be the same as Gravity (but then that film was mostly used as a stunning Earth show). But the rest of it is just slog even through the more dramatic moments which at times will have you nonchalantly shrugging off. Clooney though is definitely taking his directing skills to a new level after that awful mess, Suburbicon, but we remain optimistic that his next film as a director will be a bit better. 3/5.",The Midnight Sky

The Midnight Sky is a great escape movie into Space. I have dreamed what it would be like to see the planets up close from another planet. Kinda scary actually. I think if Augustine would have made brief contact with the Space ship on his first try ,but lost them and then had to go the remote Station for better signal, it would have created more drama.

Director: George Clooney
Starring: Geroge Clooney, Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Caoillinn Springall etcOverall rating 41/100The midnight sky is about a scientist called Augustine (George Clooney) who is alone in the arctic. As re races to stop Sully (Felicity Jones) and her fellow astronauts from returning to earth after a mystery global catastrophe. The midnight sky was just bad, it left me feeling nothing for the movie at all, which Is a shame because it had potential and had some great moments, so lets get started.Lets be nice and start off with a few positives the movie had an interesting concept, intriguing plot elements and fantastic cinematography. The movies concept was actually very interesting, having a global catastrophe and having the conflict of the point of view from earth and in space was very interesting to me. I also thought there was some good and intriguing plot elements, I found a lot of the concepts on the ship in space was really interesting in terms of holograms of family members etc and having the little girl to create growth in Augustine was well done as well. Next the films cinematography was excellent and the best part of the movie, wow this movie did look fantastic, the CGI was fantastic , and the attention to detail with the colours and the worlds was amazing, it was breath-taking to look at.However, my first few negatives are the bad narrative structure, inconsistent character screen time and terrible pacing issues. The way this movie was structured was terrible, it tried to have 3 different perspectives and it just didn't work. As soon as you were starting to connect with a character or an interesting plot point was happening they switched too a completely different set of characters that if I am being honest I didn't really care about. It really effected the pacing and the connection to any of the characters. I also found there was inconsistent character screen time because of this. It just felt like the movie did too much with the characters so it actually ended up with them actually not having nowhere near enough depth or development that is needed with a movie with this much intended dramatic heft to it. The pacing for this movie was also awful. The movie was just incredibly slow and not interesting most of the time, a large chunk of the movie felt very repetitive with hardly anything happening and the pacing never really improved as the movie went on.My next few negatives would be the lack of connection to the characters and the lack of emotional connection to the movie, as well as the lack of detail to the plot and the bland script. I had no connection to the characters throughout the movie, they were either really blandly written so therefore boring to watch or just very corny or unlikeable I also found the usage of the child version of iris to be badly cast and written into the movie, yes the bond between her and Augustine was nice but due to her not talking she was a very passive protagonist and just felt unneeded. Because of this I had no emotional connection to the movie at all. Because I didn't care or know enough about most of the characters, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters being killed off which with a sci fi drama like this should not be the case and just further proves my point of the poorly written plot and characters, the script in general was bland and generic, the dialogue was very corny and predictable at times as well. I also found there was a considerable lack of detail to the plot. The movie had this big emphasis on the world being uninhabitable and a global catastrophe but failed to actually mention why or what caused it making a lot of the movie feel pointless or lack the needed depth to it.My final positives would be the good building of tension in places, the performances and chemistry between characters as well as the good character background for Augustine. The movie did build tension well with some of the movies action scenes which I did like, I genuinely didn't know if the characters were going to survive in parts so it kept me on the edge of my seat. The performances in the movie were also great. Felicity Jones did a good job with what she had and had loads of charm. But George Clooney was fantastic. His performance was versatile, emotional and powerful. I also found the chemistry between George Clooney and the child actor Caoilinn Springall was excellent, despite no dialogue for the character the movie developed both their relationship well and he became a great protective father figure for her. And finally the movie had a good amount of character background for Augustine. We got to learn what kind of man he was and the sacrifices and mistakes he made in the past, this made me understand his character a lot more and made his mental state developing throughout the movie that much more interesting.My final couple of negatives would be the forced drama/lapses in the logic and the terribly executed plot twist. The drama that this movie created for me just felt very forced, it never really served any purpose or meaning to the plot it was just deigned to try and build tension and put the characters in dangerous situations it just never felt fluent or natural and just felt very forced. I also thought the plot twist was terribly executed. Having Felicity jones's character being Augustine 's actual daughter and the little girl not being real for me was a terrible plot twist, it made a lot of the movie pointless for me and the connection and chemistry built between the two was just wasted, it also wasn't a satisfying character arc for Augustine as he still never got to see his daughter.Overall, The midnight sky had potential. Was visually stunning and had great performances. But just has poorly constructed characters and plot and lacks the required depth and emotion that a movie like this needs, making me feel empty after watching.",The Midnight Sky

103,danybur,Elegant and beautiful film that balances adventures and introspection,8,26 December 2020,"A scientific base in the Arctic is being evacuated due to a global catastrophe in the mid-21st century. Only the astronomer Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) remains, who later discovers a girl who had not been evacuated. In parallel, a manned ship from a planet near Jupiter is returning to Earth, ignorant of the catastrophe that is devastating it.
Clooney's new film as a director is a real challenge to the new average taste of the public, which is why it is coming under heavy attack from it. He incurs several ""sins"" that the current average viewer does not forgive: his pace in general is slow (the now much reviled slowness), there are aspects of the plot that he deliberately does not explain (and that in this way become more ominous), his pessimism is evident, he avoids underlines and its end is misunderstood by many. Its conservative and more conventional aspects, which have to do with a certain occasional sentimentality and the central place that it gives to family ties are curiously overlooked.On the other hand, given that Midnight Sky in its own way pays tribute to the science fiction cinema ""with a message"" from before but ultimately privileges, with certain licenses, science fiction (let's not forget that Clooney starred in the Solaris remake) also receives hits criticism, since it does not reach or propose the degree of psychological, metaphysical or existential depth of its models or of Nolan's delusions in vogue abuse, for example.Augustine is the prototype of a brilliant scientist who has been left alone by neglecting his personal ties, in particular, family members, but who will be loyal to his ""mission"" until the end and luckily saves us transcendent monologues with voice-overs about the same.The film combines a survival on Earth drama with a ""spaceship in trouble"" drama, both of which are very well staged and lavish images of great beauty. We observe elegance and deployment in the design and resolution of technological devices (laboratories, consoles, spaceship), which nevertheless avoid overwhelming. The spikes in tension and action on the ship and on Earth are very well resolved and filmed. There is at least one sequence on the ship that will surely remain in science fiction anthologies.Clooney carries on with sobriety and solvency an aged and sick character, well accompanied by the rest of the cast.In short, an elegant and beautiful film, with great production design but that does not intend to overwhelm, which in its own way defies the current average taste of the public, which seeks to balance the science fiction of adventures and entertainment with the introspective, psychological-existential and with a message and that, in general, is successful in the challenge.",The Midnight Sky

108,Lewis_Heather787,"It's fine, just nothing that good!",6,24 December 2020,"""The Midnight Sky"" is a perfectly fine film to put on in front of the family and watch. It's a run of the mill science fiction film with a human story at the centre, with a few twists and turns.........although it does have a strange ending.Acting or story are not the main positives of this film, I would say that the directing by George Clooney is the standout part of the film. That with the great cinematography and CGI the film does look very very good. It does have a more realistic/grounded feel to it, like this could happen someday. It helps you, as an audience member, buy into the films story more and what is going on. Sometimes science fiction films like this can just now and then feel a little too far fetched, this one keeps a good balance between realism and over dramatic scenes. Thankfully the film does also have great pace to it and to be honest the 2 hours flew by for me, which was a relief due to a few reasons. So for me its more the technical side of things that are the standout in this film.Negatives. There is a weak attempt on back story for Clooney's character however none whatsoever for the space crew. I think a bit of backstory on them would have helped to gravitate towards their characters more and actually care about them. For example when one of the crew dies, I didn't care at all because I had no emotional connection to the character. Also I still don't know why the Earth was in such bad shape, I'm assuming something nuclear linked as there was a lot of radiation around. Lastly and probably the worst is ""The Twist"" which I thought was so over done and just plainly boring!!! It wasn't anything I haven't seen before and was quite obvious as the film went on. Coupled that together with the jarring ending, its as if the film just ran out of ideas and ended...........is it me or was that a really unsatisfying ending ???Overall this film is a meat and potatoes kind of science fiction film, there is nothing terrible about it but there isn't anything that good about it either. I'm being generous here I thought it was ok/average 65% out of 100. The cast is absolutely fine and does its job well, they are all good actors so I didn't expect anything else. The biggest problem for this film is there are just so many better films like this already......Interstellar, The Martian, Ad Astra etc...... I just don't see myself ever watching this again.

This plot is completely ridiculous.
It's the story of a guy who is about to die from some incurable disease (apparently, in 2049 you can 3d-print spaceships and create artificial gravity but you still need dialysis), but the joke's on the rest of mankind, because there was some ""event"" 3 weeks before that inexplicably has spread radioactive ooze all around the globe.
And this terminally ill guy decided to go somewhere in the arctic circle to try and make contact with the ship that has gone to explore one of Jupiter's moons to see if it can sustain human life, because one of the crew members is actually his daughter (though she doesn't know it).Remove the ""outer space"" gimmick. What's left? Just a mildly restrained soap-opera.

120,Mivas_Greece,"Two stories of survival (one in space, one on earth), one global disaster due to climate. Suspense and emotional, but could have been much better.",6,30 December 2020,"Space / survival movie. Clooney has several space films in his history, such as Solaris and Gravity, and this is his latest, although he stays on Earth in this one. The film combines two stories in its plot, which takes place after an event where the earth is no longer habitable and the survivors try to take refuge underground, while eveything is covered with snow and ice and snowstorms are everywhere. So one story focuses on Clooney, who, suffering from an incurable disease (some form of cancer), refuses to go with the others to the underground shelters and is left alone in the center. The other story focuses on the last group of astronauts returning from their mission to a Jupiter satellite they visited to see if it was habitable, but unaware of what happened on Earth. Having no contact with the centers on earth they worry about what has happened and how they will return safely. Clooney, on the other hand, finds this group in the system and tries to contact them in order to warn them. On the one hand, we have a case reminiscent of climate catastrophe films such as Day after tomorrow, The Colony, and the Geostorm, and on the other hand, two survival stories, each with different dangers. A very good idea, quite a good story, but it could have much better acting from everyone, as well as much more suspense.

To put it quite plainly, nothing works - story, characters, acting, direction, dialogue and scientific background are all equally uninspired and unconvincing.At the outset, some kind of apocalyptic disaster has occurred on Earth - presumably man-made. Gus, a morose, terminally-ill scientist is isolated at an Arctic research station after all his colleagues have irrationally evacuated back to the planet's toxic zones. Soon after their departure, Gus finds a young girl who has been left behind. Despite this distraction, he continues trying to contact a spaceship returning from an exploratory expedition to a fictional moon of Jupiter. This moon has proved habitable for humans, and Gus needs to warn the crew about the desperate conditions on Earth.Aboard their spiffy, Star Trekky spaceship, the five astronauts behave like imbeciles in a reject episode of the TV series, as they try to make sense of Earth's radio silence and deal with some implausible mishaps in the asteroid belt. Meanwhile back in the Arctic, Gus and the lost girl battle the elements to reach a remote radio antenna.

There are two largely unrelated narratives going on, with the shuffling Clooney muttering and mumbling through his section, while a cast of jobbing unknowns stumble and over-emote through the space-part.The direction by old man Clooney is either awful, or non-existent, as every line is delivered as a clumsy statement, to an over-bearing score desperate to over-sell what's on screen.The budget, such as there is, goes on Clooney's parts, or in CGI.

There are actually Ikea swivel chairs in some scenes, and not the good chairs.And that's the best I can find to say about it. It's not entertaining, or fun, or affecting, or memorable.

132,gcsman,Not really a sci-fi movie -- it's a fantasy/romance with both good and bad elements,6,2 January 2021,"This movie is on Netflix, which is kind of a shame because many of the scenes set in space would have been gorgeous on the big screen. But if you are looking for a hard-sf kind of space film, this isn't really it. It has many of the trappings, like a beautifully designed and rendered interplanetary spaceship (call sign ""Aether"") with swank interior design that ranks with the best such films. (Though I would rate the one in ""The Martian"" best of all.)But the feeling of this film is very different. By the end, I realized that I had been watching more of a fantasy-romance. There is almost no plot. Earthbound elderly scientist Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney) is one of the rare survivors of some eco-catastrophe that involves poisoning the atmosphere -- just how, is unsaid. From a survival pocket in the far North, he wants to warn the astronauts aboard Aether, who are returning to Earth after exploring another planet, not to land under any circumstances. That's about it! They have separate, parallel storylines and get about equal screentime. The single thing that unifies the story on Earth with the story in space is in the title: The Midnight Sky. The astronauts have nothing but the dark starlit sky, while Augustine, at the Arctic Circle, has the midnight sun effect. Each of them experiences a bit of action (which in fact is kind of arbitrary -- just there to keep some engagement up), but the whole thing is built more out of mood and ambience, with a slow and sometimes dreamy sort of feel. There are many stretches with no dialog, too. I don't mind that at all if it's well done, and Midnight Sky does it well enough most of the time. The musical score, by reliable Alexandre Desplat, reinforces this atmosphere without dominating.The cast is impressive: George Clooney; Felicity Jones; David Oyelowo; Kyle Chandler; Demian Bechir; Tiffany Boone. All good. No over-the-top emoting from anyone, at all, ever. WAY too many recent movies and TV series involving space travel give us astronaut crews that are collections of dysfunctional misfits, obviously to pump up the fake drama. (Just how do people like that qualify for an astronaut program??) That's not the case here, and it wasn't in The Martian either, which is the very best of such films. The Aether's crew are all competent, decent, well trained people who talk things out calmly and rationally whenever a decision is needed -- exactly as it should be. I appreciated that.But there are background elements that don't sit well. The astronauts are coming back from K-23, ""a previously undiscovered planet around Jupiter"". Which happens to be big, terrestrial, and inhabitable. Don't get me started. To say the least, this is utter nonsense, too much even for a fantasy that is obviously trying to connect itself to reality in other ways. Near Earth they pass through some sort of 'uncharted meteor storm' that somehow their radar misses. Again, don't get me started. And on Earth -- we're supposed to believe that Augustine is at an observatory on the northern tip of Greenland. That. too, is nonsense. Except for VERY special reasons, astronomical observatories tend to be located fairly near the equator because (a) the year-round climate is better and (b) you can see more of the sky that way. Also, no optical observatory I know of has a deep-space radio antenna.Bottom line is that the fine cast and the settings and set design make this quite watchable. Follow its mood along and it'll be fine. On the other hand, it has some junk science that is nothing much more than lazy writing. At the very end, important things seem to be unresolved, but I think that's part of the point. Again, it's all in how well it's done.",The Midnight Sky

What follows is his repeated efforts to prevent a space mission from returning home to the devastation.

Felicity Jones, Michael Oyelowo and Kyle Chandler are astronauts on the space mission that does not know what they are returning back to.
Although it took a while to get invested in this storyline and its conclusion is somewhat tentative, it's still a measured, skillfully made science fiction film that tackles familiar ground in a satisfying way.

In some films it's forgivable because the characters don't know why things are happening as they are, but Clooney's protagonist clearly knows why this all happened, so why the big mystery?They even use ""radio static"" at one point to hide the details as Clooney explains them. Why? It's to the story's detriment, ""nerds"" like me want the details, the backstory, the reason for ""why"", and not giving us this is frustrating and lazy writing.Lazy. Want to know why? The sad truth is that Clooney's character doesn't spill the details because there are none, that part of the story was deemed irrelevant so they just left it out of the writing.

It is a post apocalyptic science fiction film, or perhaps more aptly it is at the tail end of the apocalypse. It is directed by and stars George Clooney and takes place in perhaps a not too distant future where an unidentified event has left most of the world uninhabitable and deteriorating conditions will render life on Earth extinct very soon. The film takes two parallel viewpoints of the story. In one we are on the dying Earth with most of the populace fleeing to temporary safety as Clooney's scientist Augustine Lofthouse has stayed behind at an Arctic space monitoring station. Not only is he attempting to communicate with a space ship returning to Earth in an effort to divert them from returning to the doomed planet, but he is also terminally ill so running doesn't make much sense for him anyway. He discovers the space craft Aether is still en route back to Earth from a habitable moon of Jupiter but he cannot contact them due to the weak signal generated by his equipment. Also while there he discovers a young girl named Iris that seemingly was abandoned when everyone else departed. While at first reticent eventually she communicates with Augustine and is inclined to follow him. They venture out on a perilous journey across the arctic to get to a station with a more powerful signal so they can contact Aether.On the spaceship the crew of the Aether which is five strong is returning home from their mission to this Jovian moon. They busy themselves with shipboard tasks and wonder why communication from Earth remains nonexistent. They run into issues of their own dealing with an asteroid strike that cripples some of their ship capabilities. This leads to a tense spacewalk and while the scene was interesting I felt it was fairly cliché and predictable how that played out although the special effects were decent for a Neflix produced film. The majority of the time on the ship is focused on the interpersonal dynamics of the characters. The captain and another of the astronauts are a couple and she is pregnant. Most recall what they left on Earth which takes on added weight for the audience as we know that life is no more. It is a race against time as Aether nears a planet that can no longer be home.Due to his time alone there is a lot of pondering by Augustine back on Earth. He is a brilliant scientist but so wrapped up in work that he has made mistakes. He lets a woman walk out of his life as he is too consumed with work and years later when he discovers they have a daughter he still can't bring himself to even meet her. These musings are kept brief as the focus is on the primary mission of the race to warn the Aether.'The Midnight Sky' is quite a depressing film with not very much room for hope. It embraces the human condition and ponders what we do as a society and as individuals at the end of it all. There is a bit of a twist in the last portion that is a bit on the obvious side, or at least in the not very surprising category. It is meant to carry the entire weight of the film's emotion on its back, but due to being able to telegraph it the scene is sapped of some of that emotional heft. This is a very wistful, sedate, contemplative story taking on the feeling of its setting in the vast emptiness of space or the similarly cold and lonely arctic. While science fiction elements run the narrative this is primarily a very human melodrama with one emotional gut punch after the next. There is room for hope, but there is a lot of loss and grief along the way. I do like the general premise for the story but I couldn't help feel the movie was lacking somewhat in gravitas. It is as if it didn't pack enough significance and emotion in a story dealing with something as grand as the end of the world. As a result I found the film moderate in pretty much every area.Eric's Grade: C.",The Midnight Sky

The story is half baked but also predictable, the mute girl isn't that interesting and the undiscovered habitable moon around Jupiter is too ludicrous to suspend disbelief. The pacing is boring and I lost track of the number of inane plot holes that exist in order to add tension or to move the story along. Oh and don't get me started on yet another film with black male and white female couple on a ship with two eunuched white dudes tagging along and suggesting baby names ?? Sad. I can't tell you the last time I saw a non-damaged, non-asshole white alpha male and an attractive black female or even white female as the romantic leads in an ensemble cast. People reading this review can label me a racist but the ongoing demonization and emasculation of white males in Hollywood (and Netflix) is really becoming tiresome.",The Midnight Sky
145,Rino_Bortone,"DISAPPOINTING EXPECTATIONS, BUT...",5,6 January 2021,"The film has an extraordinary potential, unfortunately expressed poorly, the yield is not there, nor is the gist of the plot captured. Although Clooney is well known that as an actor he knows how to do it and in this film he does not contradict himself, indeed he reconfirms himself as such and offers an excellent performance (albeit not fully expressed), it remains that the core of the film has been lost from the point of view of the direction and more, hidden somewhere without ever really coming out into the open. Excellent cast, albeit treated superficially like the rest of the film, we note the commitment and their acting presence, always at the top. Worthy of note, however, is how Alexandre Desplat manages to emphasize even what is not relevant, with a soundtrack that manages to convey emotions and scenes with absurd ease and mastery. A wasted opportunity, despite its meanings being understood and its vision being appreciated; so of course there were other expectations, but it still manages to involve with some mentioned-above-details to not to sink completely.",The Midnight Sky
146,MongoLloyd,A thoroughly loathesome expose of the liberal American psyche.,1,2 January 2021,"On its face, this is a sci-fi ish, adventure, drama, complete with vague, unexplained, man-made, fatal planetary disaster, spacecraft, astronauts, and an epic effort to save mankind. However, littered throughout are of course implausibilities galore and the all too common subtext (these days) that white people are bad, coupled with the ever-present expectation that mankind itself is destined to destroy the Earth.As such, the cherry on this moldering, lopsided cake of despair is the idea that we (as a species) start over on another planet led by a black astronaut, far away, with a bi-racial baby as its first new child because somehow, according to ""Hollywood,"" white men are less suitable mates for their female counterparts.",The Midnight Sky

I've always seen Clooney as a far, far, far overrated both as an actor and director.And these fake positive reviews. They are writen by the people who look at yoghurt on black canvas going ""the depth is real"".This movie is a comolete and utter disaster. The ending is literally funny. Like ha ha funny.

148,joshbarton15,Failure to launch.,5,22 December 2020,"You'd have to go back to 2011 for the last time I saw a film directed by George Clooney. It was The Ides of March and I remember being pretty impressed with what he brought to the table. That being said, I've naturally associated him more with acting and he's given some really good performances over the years. Clooney returns to directing himself in a film, after taking a break in Suburbicon, with The Midnight Sky, a new science-fiction film from Netflix.Following a mysterious global catastrophe, Augustine Lofthouse (George Clooney), a lonely scientist in the Arctic, races across treacherous terrain to warn a crew of astronauts from returning home to a uninhabitable planet Earth.If you're looking to settle down and watch an uplifting film over Christmas then The Midnight Sky is most definitely not the film for you. It's a slow-burner and, while that doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, it doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere, particularly ending with quite a whimper after quite a promsing set-up. For a year where a lot of us have spent it not seeing many people outisde our own home, The Midnight Sky probably comes at the worst time for Netflix as it does really meander along in a depressive state.That being said, while I found the narrative a little too inaccessible, The Midnight Sky is a film that does feature some fine aspects in other areas. The score from Alexandre Desplat is a delight, quiet and dreamlike in the background, while Martin Ruhe's cinematography does a great job in emphasisng the isolation of Augustine in the Arctic.Coming to the performances, Clooney and his supporting cast deliver a decent standard but are let down by not much of a script to work with. It's an ambitious sci-fi film for sure but I felt it didn't quite know what it wanted to be, and it comes across that way with the performances. For a film that boasts such an impressive cast, you can't help but expect more.All in all, The Midnight Sky is a bit of a mess from George Clooney, starting quite promisingly before falling apart as a result of tonal confusion and a final act that might reach for the stars but ends up failing to launch.",The Midnight Sky
149,ilikeimdb,Silly Implausible Plot Married to Relationship 101 Catechisms,2,25 December 2020,"One needs to divide this movie between the content formed by personal interactions and that portrayed by scientific happenings. Let's start with the latter. Who allowed this silly plot to go forward?!? Nearly every single scientifically-based element is WRONG...and not just casually wrong but ANNOYINGLY WRONG: 1) Evacuating people southward to be exposed to radiation poisoning? 2) An antenna that can't reach a ship that's somewhere near the asteroid belt? Not likely 3) No one who's gone underground has any communication methods left to reach mandkind's last-hope space ship? ...and then there's the unnecessary plot complications which also strain the movie's credulity: 1) ship that suddenly fails to stay on course for no reason and needs to go through asteroids (cue Passengers); 2) trailers in the Arctic that suddenly fall through the ice (as though one could survive that and that it would happen particularly at night when it's colder - with cinematography purloined from The Piano), 3) EVAs that result in a suit puncture (cue the Martian)...but what happened to the radar in the first place that should have detected the initial asteroids coming...but also a crew member who's allegedly been trained for EVAs yet tosses her cookies at every opportunity?...she wouldn't have been allowed to go. And finally, the cliché plot of the crew splitting up because a couple of them just can't fathom what's happened to the Earth and allow relationship aspects to overwhelm all sense and reason (and what kind of radiation ""Event"" was this in the first place?!?!?). // But then there's a completely separate movie about relationships and loss and that part of the movie has a consistent message even with the big The Sixth Sense reveal at the end. I don't fault the acting done in deference to a movie with an absurd, implausible plot but it's overall not worth watching despite George Clooney's impressive beard.",The Midnight Sky
150,i_odin,A long stretched plot.,5,9 January 2021,"The Midnight Sky is almost two hour long film and yet surprisingly there is so less happening. It is totally understandable that the makers perhaps want to create a magical ""Space Opera"" like 2001. But there has to be something extraordinary driving the story. There is a clear dearth of that.Story about a lone scientist guiding few space travellers away from earth is perhaps the story in totality. It is good for a logline but unfortunately not enough to justify the length of the film. And trust me there isn't much happening apart from that. Magical cinematography, slow and gradually choreographed space walk is not something which is new. Hence this film lacks something material to make a lasting impression.Although the score and visual effects are good.
Can watch if big fan of all the star cast and have the time and patience in hand.",The Midnight Sky

152,isaacsundaralingam,The best I could say about this movie is that it looks beautiful sometimes,3,4 April 2021,"The Midnight Sky is a pretty weak movie with a few beautiful scenes. The movie just has no point and communicates nothing new. The writing is such that as each scene begins, you can almost accurately guess how it will play out. The characters are very 2-dimensional, especially that of George Clooney; which might falsely seem complicated when introduced to us, but turns out to be as shallow as the rest of them as the minutes go by.I wasn't even sold on the acting in this movie, and that almost never happens. I just feel like the acting was particularly bad. The kid was as good as a cardboard cutout, and the Aether crew with the exception of Felicity Jones failed to evoke any bit of emotion or sympathy. Add that to some of the lamest dialogue writing Hollywood has to offer, and you got yourself a movie that bores you for two-hours straight.The only reason I watched this movie is because it was nominated for an academy award under the Best Visual Effects category. But sadly, even the VFX was pretty underwhelming. I mean, yea, some scenes looked great and in those instances the VFX was decently gorgeous, but for the most part, it felt fake... the entire thing. The worlds shown were too visually artificial to even be convincing. And the cringe production designs (especially that inside the Aether Spaceship) doesn't do it any favors either.Overall, it's a very lousy movie that tries to portray itself as more sophisticated and emotional than what it really is, and what it really is is a movie you can skip and wouldn't miss out on anything at all.",The Midnight Sky
153,JamesRutland,"Excellent idea and arguments, bad plot.",5,24 December 2020,"The movie begins well, then after, the typical scenario of cruel unpredictable events prevails, probably, in order to make the movie enjoyable to that bunch of trivial audience. In my opinion, the mistake has been to adapt the movie in survival purpose for entertaining, so the viewer is forced to assist to a sequence of unpredictable negative events programmed by the storytelling. Is it possible that from the first contact to the last one there are just oppositive facts forcing to survive? It's unreal when the ratio between cause and aftermath lacks. As example, Aliens is an action movie where every negaive event has a precise cause. ""This happen why."" The unpredictable event has no precise cause, so when many of them happen, a story risks to be trivial. The excellent choice to make the dialogues among the characters more mature above all in scientific terms, so to give more realism to the narration, inevitably contrasts with the randomness of adverse events which happen continuously both in space and in earth scenario. The message of the movie is the value of family affections so to try to make better the world in which to live.",The Midnight Sky

How can two people pilot a huge, and damaged, spacecraft back to a non-existent moon of Jupiter on their own? How do they land? Is there a second shuttle craft? How do they survive when they don't know what's food - if there is anything edible? Can she give birth safely?

155,rdvljunk,fast forward,3,28 December 2020,"Basically the fundamental story could be a good one. However it is completely lost in some dragging personal issues, predicatable events and laughable science. What is good is the visuals, but I have said it often, that doesn't mae it a good movie.
I found out I was fast forwarding through even what should have been the most tense moments. Like a arctic station dissapearing in freezing water, but he, we're the tough gus (even though we need daily blood dialysis) so no problem with staying in the water for minutes. A spacewalk is fun, until ofcourse the meteorites come in at the last moment.
And in the end only ""Adam and Eve"" will pilot the huge spacecraft back to K23, an undiscovered moon that is so big the atmosphere stays on it but still it was never discovered....Ok, a movie doesn't have to be scientifically correct in order to tell a story, but there is a limit to the amount of BS I can take.BTW did anyone notice that being politically correct means black guy and white woman...never reversed....",The Midnight Sky

157,paultapner,Midnight sky,8,23 December 2020,"An adaptation of one of those novels that was most likely marketed as absolutely not science fiction oh dear me no, this sees George Clooney as an astronomer who stays behind at a remote research station when the end of the world comes along. Because he doesn't have long left. He's devoted all his life to work, at the expense of personal things. As we find out in flashbacks.Meantime a spaceship is returning from a new moon of Jupiter that can support human life thus it must be new, unaware they have no home to come back to.Then the astronomer finds he has a lost child to take care of.Initially sedate rather than slow, the early scenes at the base are quite affecting, as he has to look after the child. You don't get too much of the spaceship till the final third.All characters have journeys. Some difficulties await on the way. There is a decent feeling of jeopardy as you can't be sure who will make it to the end.An eventual communication between all does all for the point of this to come through. It's all about considering your life choices and finding value, and what you could have found, when you're at the end.It does use music very well indeed to show emotion. As it should do.I did find this quite involving and affecting, and it was interesting to have a story about human drama rather than trying to stop the end of the world, which can't be changed in here.But it doesn't really end so much as stop. It did leave me wondering what happened to one character and what they would do next.So it's one of those films that has you under it's spell while it's on, but it doesn't stick for long after.Not a bad watch though. Although it does continue the action into the end credits there's nothing at the end of them.",The Midnight Sky

161,mbhgkmsgg,The Midnight Sky,7,20 March 2021,"Having seen the first trailers for this, and having heard what it was about, I was quite excited to finally see The Midnight Sky when it came out. Yet, at the time, I didn't have a chance to see it, and after the barrage of mostly negative reviews, that excitement slowly faded. Tonight, as I was browsing through my watchlist on Netflix, I remembered that I never checked this one out. With my lowered expectations, I started the film and quickly found myself enthralled by its beauty and simplicity. And by the time it finished, I thought to myself, 'that was much better than I could've imagined.' Perhaps it was due to those lowered expectations, or perhaps I was exactly in the right mood for a film like The Midnight Sky, but I truly enjoyed what I saw.There is no denying, however, that this is a slow film. In fact, even about a year ago, I probably would've confidently claimed how boring it was. Yet, as I've delved deeper into the world of cinema, and broadened my knowledge, I have started to quite enjoy films that take their time. Films like this, do, of course, need to offer something to keep the viewer interested. Be it stunning visuals, a mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat, or a theme so strong and impactful that it grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Whatever that something is, it needs to be there. And in the case of The Midnight Sky, well, there was a mix of a little bit of everything.
Most prominently, there is the mystery surrounding the fate of the earth. It isn't quite clear as to what happened, and I for one was eager to learn more. Then there was also the mystery of the little girl that appeared out of nowhere. Once again, I found myself trying to figure out who she was. And while only one of these mysteries is truly solved by the end of it, I was content with what I got.
Then there is the beauty of this film. Every shot, as simple as it might have been, was beautiful in its own way. The scenery, especially in space, was always something to behold, and even the endless monotone ice back on Earth, somehow seemed prettier than it should've been.
And while this film wasn't thematically strong, the themes it did raise, certainly caused me to stop for a moment and reflect on them. A lot of it has to do with dealing with loneliness, but a lot of it also has to do with family. While these themes aren't exactly ground-breaking, they ended up supporting the simple, yet beautiful feeling that the filmed evoked.In many ways, The Midnight Sky was, perhaps, too simple for its own good. As such, I understand why so many people had difficulty enjoying it. I also understand why so many might claim that it's boring. As mentioned, about a year ago, I most likely would've done the same. And it's because of that, that I found myself so taken aback by how much I ended up appreciating this movie. By no means is it ground-breaking, it probably isn't even anywhere as good as it could've been. But tonight, when I watched it, it was exactly what I wanted it to be. And perhaps, had I watched it at any other time, I too would've found it boring and basic. Yet, I can't help but feel that I would appreciate it for what it is, no matter when I saw it. There was something so calming and wonderful about how this film dealt with isolation and longing. Indeed, I thought the few action scenes that there were, didn't serve much of a purpose. I would've happily watched the characters move through space and time, surviving with what they had, trying to find a way back home. And by the end of it all, there is such a strong sense of hope and purpose, that I couldn't help but feel happy.By no means is this a perfect film. In fact, it isn't even great. But for whatever reason, I found myself longing for more. The beauty that The Midnight Sky found in silence and simplicity resonated with me more than expected and gave me a wonderfully tranquil feeling. There is no doubt that this film could've been much more grandiose and special. Yet, in its inability to be those things, it found just the right chord. Yes, it's basic, and simple. Yes, it can, at times, be boring. And yes, it didn't live up to the expectations that I originally had. But somehow, it managed to ebb and flow through its story and themes in such a way, that it left me feeling happy and content, far beyond my expectations.",The Midnight Sky

While there is a message to this story, nothing really happens in the movie. It takes about 1hr, 10 minutes for things to materialize and tie together.

Never mind that Clooney's character would have been unconscious and dead, after a few minutes in the frigid water.
Never mind he happened to have a spare coat, when all other supplies sank in the water.
Never mind he would have died walking thru the subzero blizzard, without anything covering his face (and wet).

There's no preamble to what caused the apocalypse that has made earth uninhabitable, but it is obvious that climate change has destroyed the atmosphere. So, my first impression as the story unfolds is this is really depressing. But, there are moments with humor **SPOILER ALERT** when the little girl plays with her peas. And there's some excitement with the ice breaking. But, when the end comes we see a meaningful twist that gives us insight into the main character's mindset.

177,filmtravel101,Terrible script/editing that meanders but visually stunning.,4,25 December 2020,"This film has lots of potential but unfortunately the great actors and visual effects fall flat due to a terrible script/editing that feels like 2 diff stories that unfortunately do not really come together. The pseudo Revenant-like Clooney character story is all over the place and is way too long with flashback story that is full of holes and is instead of being inspiring it is rather dull and bleak. And the pseudo Gravity/ Interstellar rip off story is compelling and a vfx feast for the eyes but it feels like it's also missing lots of back story with huge holes like either the writer lost the ability to pull both stories together or it's lost in the editing room so instead it ends up feeling like small parts of 2 stories without any real appeal or cohesiveness. It should have been either one story about a mission to K23 or the other dull Clooney story which is all over the place but instead is just trite and meaningless and you truly wonder what was the real message.
Clooney does a good job directing but this must have been a nightmare to edit yet kudos to his accomplishment but it's sad to see the terrible script ruin the entire experience.
Spoiler - just one of many holes in the story - the mission flew all the way to K23 and back but somehow never was informed by NASA or anyone that earth is self destructing/polluted and yet the entire planet has time to prepare and go into hiding. Huh??

180,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A somber arthouse sci-fi film with a strong ensemble cast,6,27 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky is an arthouse science-fiction film that is told through mood and atmosphere. Martin Ruhe's cinematography of the Arctic landscapes and the spacescape is breathtaking. You can just admire the scenery in 4K resolution, lit up a pipe, and start thinking about all the universe's big questions. The jaw-dropping scenery makes you feel minuscule and you marvel at how the universe would just move on indifferently if mankind were no longer around.The film does not distinctly make its themes clear and the viewer must insert themselves and meditate on what the film is about. The themes that ruminated for me were life's regrets, leaving your life happy with your own legacy, and the internal struggle of life having meaning.The open space that the viewer is given to think is uneven at times. The action set-pieces, even though they are executed in a quieter pensive manner compared to the typical commercial space blockbuster, battle with the more artistic abstract parts of the film.This was something that James Gray's Ad Astra starring Brad Pitt, a similar sci-fi film in tone, wrestled with and fumbled. Director George Clooney balances the commercial and artistic elements much better and more organically in The Midnight Sky. Sometimes it works but other times it feels like the film is cutting in to deliver some spectacle because it's worried that you're getting bored. In the end, the amount of time we spend going through the story should warrant a bigger payoff than what is shown at the end.George Clooney, Felicity Jones, Kyle Chandler, David Oyelowo, and Demián Bichir all give solid performances, which makes this my favorite cast in a 2020 film. The Aether crew has a convincing working dynamic that provides a much-needed beating heart at the center, which stays consistent for the entire film. The actors made everything else forgivable and held my attention to the end.The Midnight Sky, while not a masterpiece, is just good enough. I enjoyed it as a one-time experience. Its appeal is niché and in time it may be forgotten and lost in the science fiction film genre. The more you appreciate its artistic intentions and the more you participate, the better the film will play for you. Film fans that like the arthouse science fiction film with a slow-burning meditative story to brood over will like it best. The general filmgoer, having seen better science fiction films, will likely give up halfway due to the grim brooding tone being so unmatching with Christmas and New Year.",The Midnight Sky

This says nothing about the film, but a lot about people's stupidity. How easy is to criticize the art of others! If the old films of Méliès, Truffaut, Woody Allen, Coppola, Scorsese or Bergman would be reviewed now, they would all get low scores. This digital era is a disaster for humanity & art.

The movie will make you think. Enjoy. Bravo, George! 9/10",The Midnight Sky
187,MovieWarfare,A lack of focus damages the movie,4,9 January 2021,"I am an absolute sucker for space and science fiction movies. When I heard that George Clooney, a charismatic and charming actor, was going to direct a space movie; I thought why not. Plus he hasn't acted in a movie since 2016 so I wanted to see him again. The synopsis is simple ""A lone scientist, Augustine (George Clooney), in the Arctic races to contact a crew of astronauts returning home to a mysterious global catastrophe"". So does this movie soar above the atmosphere or crash landing hard on the ground?Firstly, George Clooney gives a wonderful performance and might be the only actor that truly carries this movie. His interaction with a little mute girl Iris is some of the sweetest and the most heartwarming moments in the movie. Additionally, the movie is visually stunning whether it is on the arctic or in space. The visual effects are well done and the score, for the most part, is quite fitting. There are some great set designs such as the initial Arctic base and the spaceship. These all accumulate in some great cinematography and camera shots.The movie also tackles some poignant and meaningful themes about sacrifice, family and hope which is cliche but still done relatively effectively in the movie. There are also a lot of ""action"" scenes that are inspired by other movies including ""Gravity (2013)"" which George Clooney also starred in but these scenes still kind of entertaining nonetheless.However, the pacing of this movie is just atrociously slow. There are too many moments of little to nothing happening that drags this movie. There are also a fair amount of flashbacks and random nightmare which add nothing that just cut in from time to time further damaging the pacing. What's also kind of annoying is that the Arctic stuff is way more enjoyable but in the first half of the movie, they constantly cut towards the Astronaut and space just when things were interesting in the Arctic.On that note of space, the space stuff with the astronauts is so boring. The things with the astronaut in space from the first half of the movie are so devoid of any stakes or emotion that it makes it difficult for me to feel any interest or attachment to any of the astronaut characters. It gets even worse when the entire second half of the movie is focused entirely on the astronauts! It's a shame that the movie didn't just dedicate the entire story to Augustine and Iris on the arctic as this is the most effective element of the movie. The space stuff dampens the story. Due to all of this, the movie never builds enough tension or makes us feel Augustine's commitment because we keep swapping to tedious characters or irrelevant flashbacks and nightmares. There is also a reveal at the end of the movie that just raises so many questions and slightly damages the story more for me.Overall, The Midnight Sky takes a lot of elements from other space movies and apocalyptic movies but doesn't do it as well. It feels like a rather generic movie that doesn't do anything new. It's unfortunate as there is some spark of heart in the movie but the director George doesn't dedicate enough time to it. This is sadly a case of all style but not enough substance movie. Only consider watching this if you want some cool space looking things or you love George Clooney but apart from that, skip it.",The Midnight Sky

The problem with this rather slow moving story ( almost 2hr's long ) were the distracting side episodes that took away from the story line - it was like watching a race where the runners kept stopping for coffee. I am trying to be careful not to include any spoilers so I won't be specific but the one side distraction involving the space craft problems was well worth watching and gripping.

If you want to spend two hours with a dour dying Santa Clooney trying to save the last remnants of humanity (a few people hurtling home from a moon orbiting Jupiter) from a radioactive earth then you might be hoping for some thrills and spills along the way. Unfortunately, what you get here is plodding pacing, insipid dialogue, wooden acting, a musical score that kills everything faster than whatever is killing George, and daytime soap opera lighting from the 80s.There are a few scenes that look well, but where they should be thrilling there's just no sense of threat. At all. Mostly this is the soundtrack's fault, it's that kind of overly loud nothing score that hints at everything but tells you nothing which spoils any atmosphere.

Whether or not this film stays true to the book. I do not know. At two hours in length this film feels like it's story is both too slow (following a group of astronauts floating through space) and too fast (random scientist that's able to cross a frozen tundra in what feels like a day). We're randomly brought to this lone scientist on top of the world waiting to make radio communications with the last group of astronauts in space. No backstory is indicated right off the bat about what's happening, one would expect to get more info as the film trucks along. However, that is not the case as we still don't by the end what state the world is truly in. Alas, this could've been a mini TV series as opposed to a film to draw out more info and hopefully more excitement.Overall:
While not a complete bore fest. I definitely won't be calling this a must see. I did enjoy George Clooney's role in this film although his scenes were more exciting.

And beside Clooney nobody really convinces in their roles. Only George gives it all, stumbling through snow storms, diving in icy lakes and looking convincingly miserable.And even for a fan of Interstellar and similar slow-burn scifi movies, this is unnecessary elongated.

There's no attempt to explain how this happened, and it's a very shaky foundation to build an entire movie on. Because this isn't explained there are unsatisfying scenarios all throughout the movie that just evoke a sense of ""why""? and ""what the hell""? For example - How could the spaceship possibly not know about the situation? What do the two astronauts who return to earth expect to achieve? We also don't know if there's any established settlement on Jupiter's moon. If there isn't why would the other astronauts attempt to return there?

It is so boring that if it wasn't for the above point I would not have completed watching it.What works in a book does not work for the film here. Not enough dialogues make for so many quiet moments you feel the need to fast-forward. If you dig into the technical details of the story it makes no sense. The ""event"" is never explained, but also not explained how in 2043 where there are holograms, see-through screens and all the goodies, you can lose connection with earth station with being completely in the dark. Also disturbing to me is the fact that they keep sending 20 yr olds that never even did a spacewalk (!) to multi-year exploration of space, and forgive the mature 20-year-olds out there, that particular female astronaut was not. Also, how do you lose the most important machine for you during the ice-breaking crisis, just keep it on your person, why throw it on the snowmobile WTH? Last point - the rotating spaceship would create gravity-force toward the outwards of the ship and the vision in the window will be constantly rotating. I feel that the book writer (Brooks-Dalton) didn't think about all these details and they had to make something up when translated into a picture, with little success.Due to these reasons mentioned, it was hard for me to enjoy this movie, it is long, long and boring.

The scenes set in space are expertly designed, and shot well by Martin Ruhe, but they feel entirely devoid of human emotion (until the final act manipulatively calls for it). There's something so sterile and antiseptic about the space half of this film that it can't maintain viewer interest or sympathy beyond a filmmaking exercise. It has no oxygen and no heartbeat.
Most of the time, ""The Midnight Sky"" drifts like space debris between its three settings-shuttle, Arctic, flashbacks-instead of feeling like it's building momentum.

Also begs the question: would you rather watch a film where the first 75% is great but the ending destroys the film. Or the opposite: the first 75% is fairly annoying but it ends well. This film is mostly the latter.The Midnight Sky started off pretty well for the first 17 minutes. A slow drama, the arctic, nice sceneries mixed in with astronaut intros. It draws you in.After this, it resembled something out of Murphy's Law in the most annoying way. (The following has nothing to do with the film, no spoilers). Imagine you're driving from point A to point B and suddenly a (contrived) meteor hits right in front of you. After some (contrived) drama, you forge ahead. Now a (contrived) wall of bees is headed your way. You are roughed up, hurt, stung a few times but bravely continue. Crazy stuff you murmur to yourself as you continue forward to get to grandma's house. Suddenly the (contrived) car battery dies...It goes on like this until you hit the 1 hour and 30 minute mark. It's all filler. Remove it and it doesn't effect the story in any way.The last 22 minutes continues the core story - which I found excellent from a slow emotional drama standpoint. So, you basically have a 39 minute film (the first 17 minutes and the last 22 minutes) and 1 hour and 13 minutes of (too much) frustrating filler in between.I would rate the core story an 8. It's a pretty good slow drama. The filler rates a watchable but annoying 3 or 4. There are enough moments in the filler to keep you entertained but it's a tightrope between watching more and giving up. All together, this film rates a 6 because by the time the film ends, you're saying ""ok, this wasn't so bad"" - so the ending makes up for the (mostly) nonsense that lies in between.If you like the story concept: I recommend watching this.",The Midnight Sky

Personally, this movie connected with me.The main thing I loved about this film is how restrained and quiet it is. It doesn't rush to give you all the answers or to get to the ""exciting"" sci-fi parts. It follows a small group of characters and it is more concerned with the emotional stakes rather than the bigger picture. This is a character driven drama through and through and it doesn't hide that fact. Yes, you can see some plot points in this film coming, but I think they're handled so well it doesn't matter. I also thought the cinematography and the score was brilliant as well.If you're looking for a fun sci-fi movie or a detailed and cerebral sci-fi movie then you're not going to find that with this film. If you're looking for a sci-fi movie that goes straight for the heart strings and deals with themes such as sacrifice, family, and isolation then you will love this.

213,jabandrade,"I know what the point was, but SciFi is something else.",7,25 December 2020,"Netflix had an interesting plot for this new sci-fi venture: the deterioration of living conditions on Earth, extinction and the search for a new planet. Excellent cast, clearly powerful production. But Clooney preferred to invest in a drama about parents, children, failed marriages, family crises, lost relationships, longing, existential meditations and impending death. And so the exciting initial idea disappears after a few minutes, drowned out by the personal issues of the Clooney character. In my opinion, a bad choice. This would certainly take the plot in another direction, at a different pace. It's ok. I got it. Until it touched me a lot in this regard, it particularly affected my personal demons. But they could have left such a plot to settle on Earth and focus on the plot from the beginning. It's not a bad movie, but the initial idea promised a lot and, after all, it's SciFi, okay? The production and the cast are too big for the proposed objective.
It is Netflix's fourth attempt with SciFi that leaves us with that ""could have been better"" feeling: AD Astra, Away, Cloverfield Paradox and now this one. They urgently need assertiveness and diligence in providing science fiction production. Perhaps making the right choice between what can be resolved on Earth and what should go into space.",The Midnight Sky

222,mxsuba26,"If 2020 wasn't depressing enough, this late Dec release is the final peanut on the turd.",10,24 December 2020,"An awfully dark depressing film. Like a modern take off of Neville Shute's ""On the Beach"" (this film has a scene in which one astronaut is watching that movie) with a bit of Bruce Dern's Silent Running from 1972 thrown in.In a nutshell: Without giving away the plot and several clever surprises, this is set in 2049, the earth is dying (no reason given). Our blue planet is just a brown, sulfury, smoky mess, the air is unbreathable and the cities are dead. Picture Detroit. The people are evacuating to underground shelters where they will only survive for a while. The Clooney is a enigmatic and sickly loner scientist who stays alone at an evacuated frozen and snowy astronomical research station located somewhere (no location given) in the Arctic, Antarctica or someplace else really cold and barren. He abandoned his wife and daughter years ago to do his research. He manages to make contact with a massive space station staffed by a multicultural team of five astronauts that traveled to and found a habitable planet and is now returning to earth with no knowledge of what happened here. The new planet, named K43 or 49K or Special K or something like that, is described as ""just like Colorado"" (minus the pot shops, Mercedes G Wagons and ski resorts of course) and perfect for human life. When the astros find out about the state of earth, they have to decide on whether to keep going or book back to New Colorado. Big bearded George really says very little in this film. but he plays the role well. Most of the dialog is from the astronauts. It is a depressing film, though not quite as grim as On the Beach. There is only one really positive scene that has to do with a Neil Diamond song. I gave it a ten due to its uniqueness, good special effects and that I like George's films. But you gotta' shave George. That beard is not you.",The Midnight Sky
223,Mustang92,We needed Vampires or Zombies or Nudity,3,26 December 2020,"Many flaws in this crappola movie, such as:
A habitable Moon circling Jupiter with Colorado landscape AND air...!Some kind of unexplained Apocalypse on Earth (with radiation) that is/will affect the entire planet -- even the poles -- within days. Would never happen, not even with a WW3.George Clooney's character never gets hypothermia, even though a normal person would be dead after the first ""incident.""Clooney's character has cancer or some terminal disease -- and NEVER hallucinates except about an ""imaginary"" 6 year old girl. Huh?? (Which we later learn would be his daughter from the past -- who he's never even met. WTF?) How convenient that he only hallucinates about that.Since his 6 year old daughter isn't actually there, how'd the fire get started in the kitchen? Or who left the half-eaten bowl of cereal on the table? And what effing idiot wrote this effing script?The spacecraft goes off course early in the movie (just like the movie itself!), and is so off course, they have to map a new route to Earth. What a bunch of crap. This is 2049. Spacecraft in 2020 (heck, even in the last century) don't go off course this bad. They are always course-correcting, CONSTANTLY.But now because it's SO off course, they have to map a new route, and there's a section in our Solar System that hasn't been mapped so taking that route could be dangerous. WHAT? Our entire Solar System has been mapped. It was mapped 40+ years ago. Scientists know where all the astroid belts are, etc. And it's not 2020 anyway, it's 2049!When the Maya character gets a life-threatening injury, there is no doctor or medical expert among the crew of 5. WHAT? Give me a break. How ludicrous.Now for some cliches:
Of course, we have to have scenes where the space craft has trouble communicating with Earth. Check.And we have to have people from the spacecraft do a space walk, where one of more will be in danger of being killed while outside the craft. Check.And one of them will be killed, and it will be the character with the smallest role. Check. (As soon as the Maya character was told she'll be going out to help fix the damage from the meteor shower, I knew she'd be dying.)One of the writers of this movie, was the writer of ""The Revenant"" -- another SnoreFest. Maybe someday he can learn how to write a script that can hold an audience's attention. Of all the Oscar Nominations ""The Revenant"" got, not one for the writing! The other writer of this lame movie, has apparently never written a script before. If only these 2 writers had added some Vampires or Zombies or something a little more engaging, I might have added an extra star or two. ;)And why did George Clooney direct this? Why, George, why? Your best movie was your first, ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" Everything since then you've directed has been mediocre. Has too much success blunted your creative edge in life?

Aboard the craft are five people, three men and two women. One man and woman are black, one woman and two men are white with one of the men being Hispanic. Right off the bat, the sole white woman is pregnant by the black man so we can already see the PC police at work but what really becomes over-the-top if you really think about it is that in the process of the journey the writer kills off the only black woman and the two white men choose to descend to their deaths on earth rather than live.Stop and really think about that message for awhile!

228,machrf,You have to suffer through the movie to get to the last 10 minutes...,4,26 August 2021,"First I have to comment on a goof that is not a goof. One comment says the radiation on Jupiter's moons is too great for humans. This is incorrect that is easily found in a simple search. In fact, they are keeping the door open for habitats on one or two of Jupiter's moons.Also, Math, PC be damned. There are many anomalies in the English language and once working at NASA the use of math is common. Sheesh, people don't be so sensitive.As for the movie, I agree with many of the other reviews. There is too much wrong with the movie to enjoy it. Especially the scenes of the space ship. It seems they have taken all the worst scenarios of Sci Fi films from the 60's and put it all into one film. They are told from the POV that the audience has not gained any knowledge of science since then. Then the ship seems to be a mixture of advanced and current technology that is not durable for space missions of such length. It is one thing to have the ISS protected in Earth's orbit vs a fragile space ship traveling a long voyage in our solar system. Then again, how likely would it be for them to meet up with the issues they ran across in the movie?This is a Drama movie in a Sci fi setting and does the worst job imaginable mixing the two. The most important questions are answered in the last 10 minutes before the last 10 minutes of ending credits. So, 20 minutes from the actual time ending. I will say this since I've seen so many comments that the question of who is Iris is answered in the last communication from the spaceship. The scenes of his past and Iris, and his determination to continue due to the little girl, does make a great drama, but you have to suffer through all the plot failings to see it.

The story sets when a scientist races to contact a crew of astronauts to stop them from returning due to a global catastrophe on Earth. I didn't have any expectations, I really wanted to enjoy this film as it is but it lacked feeling. The main theme was to never let your goal or ambition get in the way of having a life but it was projected very weakly. The storyline was vaguely similar to Interstellar (2014) but it can never be compared to or even be on the same level, far from it because the film Interstellar is a masterpiece and The Midnight Sky was the complete opposite. I like dramas, I also like any kind of structured pace and there are a lot of great films with a slow pace but this storyline was flat. There was no suspense and I blame the music for not properly establishing it. The ending was expected due to the foreshadow which can be caught so early in the movie. The only thing I liked was the beautiful visuals so mesmerizing I was in awe but it doesn't save the film.The composer Alexandre Desplat was all over the place, the music didn't fit with this kind of movie and it was making the scenes so annoying. I think if the music was different it could have changed the perspective of the film because the music is the most important part of a movie without it there is no emotion. This composer has many great scores but sadly he failed in this one.The cast was solid every single one of them the problem was not their performance it was the direction, the script, and the music.

+interesting premise
+post apocalyptic and science fiction atmosphere is cool
+some well designed sets
+some moments of fair quality acting
-poor/hard to follow story
-boring film on the whole
-bad acting in many places
-poor CGI
-poor direction
-moments of ridiculousness indicating a poorly written scriptA description and my thoughts follow:The Midnight Sky is an interesting film, following a scientist stranded on Earth after nuclear or environmental devastation. He has remained behind due to sickness, and is helping spaceships navigate there way out of Earth - and he awaits the return of long term spaceships that have traveled deep into the solar system, on there way home not knowing what has happened. The movie flips between the scientist and a crew of astronauts making there way home from K-23 - a newly discovered inhabitable moon in orbit around Jupiter.This movie sounded great, and indeed has some cool atmosphere to it. A post-apocalyptic world ravaged by radiation and deep cold from a nuclear event, and a space drama about a crew returning home with no communications from Earth. The atmosphere, and some of the set quality, is great, and the acting not too bad, although there are moments of drama that falls flat due to poor direction on the actors part. The story itself, while interesting in theory, largely falls apart, and the film feels uninteresting and is difficult to follow with any clarity.

There are minor logic holes every now and then, but you can overlook that.Some further background information would have been nice. What exactly is happing on earth? What did the crew's exploration work look like? These are questions that would have interested me. Just throwing the viewer into the action and throwing in a few bites over the course of the movie is not enough for me. Presumably, the underlying book will address this issue more.But what has to be emphasized positively is the high-quality production. You can see that in all places. The scenery, imagery and effects look really good throughout. Especially the scenes in the space are excellent.The story is told in three lines that run together over the course of the movie. The character of George Clooney is considered intensively while the other characters remain rather flat.The movie had potential, which was not exploited.

While Clooney is excellent as an old, ill man and his interaction with the little girl is touching (also due to the acting performance of the girl), this part of the movie is, just like the part where we follow the astronauts, just not compelling enough. The movie leans too much on camerashots and atmosphere, instead of a compelling story and a good script. But on the other hand, it does manage to portray a glimpse into a not too distant future, where humanity is facing a possible extinction, due to its own faults. So... I still rate this movie a 7, because I watched it with interest and it kept me entertained throughout. And Clooney playing an old man with a beard is a pleasure to watch. He's a fantastic actor.

264,vandeman-scott,"OK film, could use a public health warning",7,23 December 2020,"It never ceases to amaze me what people will give one-star and ten-star reviews to. ""The Midnight Sky"" deserves neither.Outstanding production values boost adequate performances and a fair script featuring two distinct storylines that slowly converge, and they do so in a way that makes enough sense to be watchable. That said, odd subplots and the occasional flight of fancy lend an absurdist air to an already disturbing story.Complaints in IMDb reviews primarily target pacing and bad science. Yes, this film has a slower pace, but it's entertaining enough if your attention span can withstand more than a music video. My scientific education is in health sciences/surgery, so I'm no expert on space or the environment; however, nothing in this movie stretched me beyond my willingness to suspend disbelief.Thematically, ""The Midnight Sky"" is reflective of the dismal year that is 2020. As we suffer through quarantines, lockdowns, and legitimate worries about the viability of our immediate future, we can see ourselves easily in the characters, all of whom, at some level, experience alienation, pervasive regret, and a sense of creeping dread.As movies go, this one isn't particularly uplifting, so if a happy ending is a must for you, think about looking elsewhere. The filmmakers do offer a scintilla of hope for those who really need it to get through the night. But not really. The extinction event that determinists believe is humanity's inevitable destiny is the real ending. As the credits roll over a mundane vignette, we know our species is dead, and we're simply waiting for a few stragglers to catch up.Current events have led even the best of us to nurse the occasional defeatist sentiment, so ""The Midnight Sky"" could be a tough watch for some.

I am fairly game to suspend my disbelief but they completely lost me when two of the characters were submerged in freezing water and then, presumably soaked, had to do a hard trek in the middle of an arctic blizzard but somehow survived. Plus, one of the characters is so sick they're undergoing dialysis but survives trekking several miles across the Arctic. I just can't. I loved the plot line of the little girl until the very end when we discover that the little girl was a hallucination. Honestly, if I had read the book I would've thrown it across the room at that point. It is than an it-was-all-a-dream ending. I guess viewers are supposed to walk away from this thinking that it was OK that a father turned his back on his child for her entire life as long as he shows up at the very end of his life to save hers along with human civilization.

Instead we just have an event, man made it would seem and we have incinerated the earth, a far more realistic end I would suggest.Into this we have the end times of a dying man (Clooney) whose life work has denied him a real life and in his and the earth's final days he tries to save the returning space mission from destruction and maybe give humanity another chance somewhere else.This is certainly melancholy and Clooney the actor delivers without it being maudlin. As the director Clooney gives us a story which in the long run is life affirming and gives the ensemble cast a chance to breathe life into characters that could have been just clichés (see The Martian for a large dose of cliche).The film is not without its problems, the pace drops in a few sections and the back story perhaps needed a bit more flesh but the overall effect was a positive end to our time on earth.",The Midnight Sky

The chief problem here though is the story; it's pointless - it goes nowhere! It literally goes to the end of human kind....It starts badly - and stays there. It's pace is glacial.There are too many technical weaknesses. For one thing; there is no possibility whatsoever of there being an ""undiscovered moon of Jupiter""; Galileo would turn in his grave. In space there is time lag in radio communications due to the vast distances - but there was no time lag! And why did the spacecraft suddenly push hugely off course? The laws of physics says that's impossible nonsense. And you don't get day and then night just above the Artic Circle; it's impossible! You get a very long day with twilight every 24hrs, then twilight then night with twilight every 24hrs, and that's the year!Then there are the stupidities; going on a dangerous spacewalk in an area that the astronauts know is dangerous. You just wouldn't do that, and if you did you certainly wouldn't be singing ""Sweet Caroline""!

I had high hope that Clooney finally bagged some retro earth disaster movie but boy it isnt. I mean, yes there is a disaster on Earth. Clooney tried to explain what when he was in contact with a space vessel but lost reception, and hence the plot was lost also.
In a nutshell, Clooney must save the only manned space ship from the disaster of returning to Earth because it is now largely uninhabitable and almost everyone is dead. The space crew are essentially the last human survivors but they dont know it until they're orbiting Earth at the end of the film. In the end, one crew member was killed repairing external damage from an ice field in space, the captain and a technical officer take a pod to commit suicide back on earth. Clooney is dying and would have no way to get into space. Only two crew are left, a man and a woman, to return to a newly discovered moon orbiting Jupiter that may sustain human life. This film served no purpose. There were no obvious morals to the story. No real connection between characters. No action to speak of. Plenty of boring and over-used flashbacks to fill the time. It's not a film. Barely a sci fi, and for post apocalypse, no idea what everyone died from or was being evacuated from.

All that these depressive U.S. doomers writing scripts nowadays are capable of coming up with are post-apocalyptic stories where the world keeps trying to do business (and war/politics) as usual despite all the evidence of the irreversible destruction it's causing, everything we cared about on this planet nearly or actually goes to hell, and meanwhile we're supposed to believe either in some magical technological solution popping up out of nowhere (Interstellar) or some impossible move off-planet to somehow still ""save"" our species (meaning just a few individuals with no hope of actually rebuilding the species). The only glimmer of hope in this climate comes from China - even their sci-fi is about global cooperation, not competition; collectivist thinking and efforts, not rabid capitalist individualism (see The Wandering Earth).

I can totally agree to the average ratings of 5 stars, since the focus on important perspectives on the plot was left underdeveloped. First off, the good stuff is: cinematography, visuals, CGI, SFX, pacing. The usual candidates so to speak. The soundtrack does its job nicely. It's only at the ""repair scene"" outside the ship that the music is drifting astray sounding goofy.Then my concerns: After ""Gravity"" and ""Solaris"" we've seen George Clooney handling space quite well for cineasts. Since he is not only the main character in ""The Midnight Sky"", Clooney also wears the hat of a director, which rises the assumption, he must have been quite amazed by the storyline. But was he aware of the bumps along the road? I did not read the book and I don't care about the storytelling by the author. The script must fit a movie and Mark L. Smith has proven his skills with ""The Revenant"". I can live with the lack of explanations about the conditions of our planet in the near future. It's not about what the major population went through. I get it, it's about the fate of each character and their relationships, which usually makes a good movie. I missed connecting to the people in focus over two hours of running time.Here are the ""bumps"" that annoyed me most: How could young Augustine be such a narcisstic sociopath when he actually strived for helping the world? He acts like a insensitive prick lacking of any emotion for his woman. The fact she tells him quite calm about her miscarriage like ""sorry hun, I forgot to buy milk at the grocery store today"" doesn't help the soiled picture. The airplane scene with a lone survivor who, for some reason, wasn't introduced the wolf pack just didn't make any sense. At all. The fact that Augustine imagined the girl was quite obvious, but I didn't care. She helps him through the struggling and that's okay. But meeting the older version of her at the end is worth a moment of face palm. Maya stealing a device from NASA without them noticing made me scratch my head. Maybe she had to go because of this? After the rough ride the ship just made it to Earth with the smallest crew possible. Yet two essential members are free to abandon mission for personal reasons? Despite the fact that entry points are more than deadly? Only a loving couple left for the ship. No prob, let's head back to unknown territory with a badass slingshot move. The lights went out slowly after each of them left the control room which gave me a sense of machines won't last without the human touch and that was quite comforting. But the ship...eye candy for Sci-Fi lovers and not fit for space at all! With it's wobbly hull and the pine cone shaped glass shield it was destined to break since the very first scene. Luckily the debris only destroyed stuff that can easily be repaired like comm systems or the over-estimated radar. Speaking of: I can sense irony having a good time with the cynical script writer since the radar just went on shortly before the deadly debris arrive warning the crew with a ""proximity alert"" like a second before they were hit. Technology is such a bliss!
I was also quite disappointed to find out the B&W movie at approx. min. 39 was a real movie ""On the Beach"", probably to feature some relationship of actor Ethan Peck. They should have filmed a unique scene to mimic an actual movie to support the dream world here.
Many reviewers pointed out the event of swimming in arctic water...well I am gonna leave it there. But you're not getting away with pointing out the importance of an oxygen mask to ""never take it off"" and then walk outside without it, let alone wearing any kind of goggles in these harsh arctic conditions.To sum it up: like in many cases with modern movies we find ourselves surrounded by convicing visuals but a lack of acting and storytelling. If they would have just cleaned the black spots and focused on streamlining more than a bit we could have an entertaining space flick to ponder. And man, somebody give George Clooney a musical role finally!",The Midnight Sky
296,Jonas1969,"Aiming for Solaris, not Armageddon",7,23 January 2021,"If you like SciFi and enjoy dark tales then this may be for you. This is not a joyful action romp in space. If you are a stickler for scientific accuracy then you will also find lots of faults. I won't list them all here because that would spoil a lot, but I will say that I wish any film would depict an asteroid belt or a debris-field in space accurately, this does not.
The story begins with Augustine (Clooney) staying behind on an arctic station when everybody is evacuated. Augustine is staying to contact a returning spaceship. The happenings of Augustine and what occurs on the ship are brought closer through a series of flashbacks that give a somewhat ironic end twist to what would otherwise have been an even bleaker film. The story on the ground is much better than the one in space, partly because it is much more poignant and partly for all the scientific flaws. I find the ending lacking primarily for the place we leave those on Earth. This is not a bad movie by any means, but it could have been so much better with very little effort, and that is a shame.",The Midnight Sky

298,daniel-kyle,Read the book FIRST!,9,23 December 2020,"I am not the biggest fan of Clooney, and read the source material (the book) a year ago and it was not the best post-apocalyptic tale that I have read either - though really it is not about an apocalypse and is at heart a story of humanity. That book, ""Good Morning, Midnight"" by Lily Brooks-Dalton shares its title with a 1939 novel by Jean Rhys and their similarities of take on the human condition should not be discounted. I strongly recommend reading the Brooks-Dalton story first because without that background much of the movie seems disjointed.
In the end though, expecting little but needing some entertainment early in the morning of Dec 23rd, I attended my own private premiere of the movie on Netflix. I was pleasantly surprised, and have awarded the movie a 9 out of 10 here despite its flaws, notably in pacing and, again, that much of what is happening seems like incomprehensible vignettes unless you have more information to work with. But it is a beautiful movie with great production values, and Clooney should ultimately be commended, and recognized not only for his direction but some decent acting here too.
We are in a new era of film viewership with streaming instead of sitting with a couple of hundred other people in a theatre. Movies like this one with a decent budget but more drawn out, as art house films of the 1960's and 70's were, will likely become the top tier of releases rather than the giant superhero movies we have been used to the past decade. In that way, the rise of a digital society, perhaps sequestered for periods of time during a health crisis, and often solitarily, will usher in more of these types of movies. That is not such a bad thing, and compared to the plethora of very low budget, including foreign dubbed movies to meet the demand of the burgeoning viewing platforms, an imperfect film such as Midnight Sky may even be looked back upon as this era's Citizen Kane.",The Midnight Sky

302,AW_McGOWAN,Clooney's First Sci-Fi Outing Falls Short,5,2 January 2021,"Netflix's ""The Midnight Sky"" is an adaptation of Lily Brooks-Dalton's 2016 sci-fi novel ""Good Morning, Midnight."" George Clooney directs while also playing the main character-a dying scientist named Augustine Lofthouse. In the year 2049, Lofthouse is one of the last men alive on Earth after an unexplained event wipes out most people and sends the rest of them into evacuation. In his solitude, he tries to warn a returning spacecraft about the planet's inhospitable condition. In order for his signal to get cross, he must traverse the Earth's blizzardous remains to a different transmitter. Before he embarks on the perilous journey, though, Lufthouse finds a young mute girl named Iris (Caoilinn Springall), who was supposedly left behind when her family evacuated.Lufthouse's story is just half of the movie, however. The other half is made up of scenes aboard the Aether: the ship that Lufthouse needs to warn. The Aether is returning from a journey to K-23, a habitable moon of Jupiter that flashbacks reveal Lufthouse discovered as a young astronomer. A pregnant astronaut named Sully (Felicity Jones) captains the Aether with her crew of Adewol (David Oyelowo), Mitchell (Kyle Chandler), Sanchez (Demián Bichir), and Maya (Tiffany Boone). Unaware of Earth's destruction, this crew braces the dangers of space travel with hopes of returning home.With wide spacescapes and some highly cinematic sequences, ""The Midnight Sky"" was surely made for theaters. Unfortunately, a December 2020 release date forced it to embrace a direct-to-streaming debut. This is a shame, but one that many movies have had to face during the pandemic-smitten year. Perhaps if I were watching ""The Midnight Sky"" on a big screen I would think differently about its special effects, yet from my standard television set, the visuals were nothing exceptional. Ultimately, the earthly scenes consisted of snowy white-outs while the space sequences were no more spectacular than what we got seven years ago with Alfonso Cuarón's ""Gravity."" For a science-fiction drama, I expected something a little more aesthetically dazzling.Meanwhile, Lufthouse's adventure is something that we've seen many times before-a hardened old man making a trecherous journey with an innocent child at his side. It echoes ""Shane,"" ""Logan,"" and even what would've been it's 2020 boxoffice competition: Paul Greengrass' ""News of the World."" While ""The Midnight Sky"" includes a slight twist at the end to make things more original, one could easily find the twist predictable or even cheap. At the same time, the adventure on Earth often feels disconnected from the adventure in space. Just when we get the most invested in Lufthouse and Iris' story, we switch away to Sully and the crew for an extended period. While there are elements of harmony, ""The Midnight Sky"" often gives off the impression that it hastily crams two movies into one.And on top of that, the script is composed of unremarkable, sometimes clichèd dialogue. The soft spoken Lufthouse will occasionally drop a profound line, and Kyle Chandler and Demián Bichir's characters sprinkle in a little humor, but most of the talk is uninspiring. At its worst, it's even boring.As a science fiction movie, ""The Midnight Sky"" is a bold outing for Clooney. The actor has directed only six films before this and most of them have been period-pieces grounded in reality. He obviously had to learn some new tricks for this highly technical picture, and it plays quite well as a freshman entry in such a difficult genre. I also applaud him for breaking his aging pretty-boy typecast to play a grizzled, crestfallen protagonist. Lufthouse maybe smiles once throughout the entire movie, and even then it is difficult to discern beneath the shaggy white beard hiding Clooney's frail face.However, the film's best acting probably goes to Chandler and Boone, followed by Clooney, Oyelowo and Bichir. The young Springall also gives a stellar performance in her first motion picture. Oddly, despite being the picture's biggest star after Clooney, Felicity Jones does not display the most apparent chops here. Sully is simply not a deep enough character for such a dynamic actress. Although Silly holds lofty narrative importance, there's not much development for Jones to work with.Unfortunately ""The Midnight Sky"" misses a few marks. A messy year for cinema ripped it from its intended big-screen release, but even then, the script could have used some work. In a year where Netflix has really rocked the boat with high quality films, ""The Midnight Sky"" garnered some hype upon release, but its legacy will probably parallel that Steven Soderbergh's ""The Laundromat."" In 2019, Soderbergh's Netflix original feature had a great cast and some positive buzz, but it ultimately fell to the shadows of ""The Irishman"" and ""Marriage Story."" ""The Midnight Sky"" will likely see a similar fate in 2020, fading from Netflix subscribers' memory behind ""Da 5 Bloods"" and ""The Trial Of The Chicago 7""",The Midnight Sky

And some things are just not explained, so even if they were feasible/justifiable, we would never know. We aren't even privileged enough to know why Augustine is in the arctic research station at the very start of the movie, which is pretty central to the story's main arc, if you ask me.There are so many better movies that similar bits of ideas were lifted from, that the only reason I'm giving it more than 1 star is that the actors did a good job of making the most out of such thin material.Honestly, even the title of the movie is lost on me.

Objectively speaking the story stands as a notable reflection of a troublingly prevalent fatalistic outlook on the future of our species.
Subjectively though the sheer hopelessness is palpable from start to finish. Which incidentally should be the tagline for the year 2020, hence why I regret watching the movie two days before Christmas!
There are barely any laughs to be had here, and those rare moments of levity are weak and don't endure long. And while the exciting scenes of snow and space action/crises are legitimately toe curling and well-shot, the stakes never seem to matter given the inevitability of the outcome.

322,World-viewer,The Clooney Ego Vivified,1,27 December 2020,"Seriously - think of $100m worth of vaccines or just food or aid distributed to the poor and needy. Instead someone thought this load of crap was more worth it. Let's give Clooney $100m - what could go wrong? And boy did he deliver. A turd in a league of its own.Ok - here's the gist. In the near future, a possibly habitable moon of Jupiter is discovered. A crew is dispatched to investigate. While they're gone, for some reason they're completely incommunicado, and back on Earth, climate change suddenly ravages and blows up the Earth. The planet is evacuated, and everyone is put on helicopters to go somewhere, curl up and die. No Bill Pullman here inspiring humanity to do an end-run around destiny, to fight on. Nope. Just give up. The movie does not relish in details like where exactly they go, how, or what they'll do to survive, or for how long. Nor how so many helicopters could be built, even in the future, or whether they are spacecraft or whatever vehicles are required to completely empty the earth. In two years. It does not get into whether Eric Trump is President and whether climate denialism is still a thing and why half the people are not protesting the other half no matter what, as is wont in a post-truth society. All we know is something really bad happens to the air and the Earth somehow is totally evacuated in two years.Clooney is cast as a terminally ill astronomer (again, why? What is the relevance? Everyone is doomed as it is) who discovers the said habitable planet, but inexplicably stays behind to man an arctic observatory. No explanation offered, none required. Somehow this one aging, sick man can run an entire site in the middle of the Arctic, singlehanded. I guess now we know why there is so much unemployment. Robots - first they dance, then they take our jobs. Anyways, upon the ship's return, the exploratory mission cannot find anyone to answer their phone calls. In an act of desperation, they even attempt to contact India and Australia. I guess that is when you know it is an emergency when the India call center won't take your calls. BTW Calling India - this is a decision reached with no small amount of deliberation by the crew, mind you. Why? Who knows.Clooney, by the way, is bored stiff and while playing gin rummy wiling away the final hours, by accident suddenly realizes this ship is due back. Typical oh crap! Moment. And tries to raise the crew. Guess everyone forgot about the first manned mission to Jupiter? Clooney however finds out his high-tech setup isn't high tech enough to even send a text message to the intrepid explorers as they hurtle back from the unknown. Never mind that we have been communicating with remote spaceships like Voyager since the 70s, with much less powerful equipment.Anyway, Clooney discovers he is not alone in his Arctic refuge. A lost child lurks within the site. And has been sleeping in some shelves somewhere, but apparently is not any worse for wear as she somehow also has found plenty of food, despite not knowing where the kitchen is. Again, let's not get into the plot-holes.Clooney locates ANOTHER billion-dollar mega-tech site, a short hop away by snowmobile. Why you would put two large expensive antenna sites side-by-side, in the Arctic, who knows. But, with aid of this child, or despite her, he climbs aboard a snowmobile to trek to this other high tech station to have a chat with the returning ship to let them know to not come back because of how royally we screwed things up in the two years they were gone (yes folks, climate change only takes that long to wreak havoc).Along the way, he faces some inexplicable but ridiculous adventures, nearly drowns, shoots someone, and is stalked by wolves. The point? Probably some symbolism and metaphors missed by simpletons like this reviewer. Finally, after reaching the station, he can talk to the ship. At first, they are in disbelief. But really guys? Two years? And there has been no communication? Were they on the Santa Maria? And it couldn't have been that much of a surprise - hell, scientists are hoarse from bleating these warnings.. today!Anyway, to the movie. Being stoic professionals, they thoughtfully analyze the situation, given the heavy implications of any action and the fact that the future of humanity is hanging in the balance. As expected, logic is promptly chucked out the nearest space hatch and sentimentality wins out. Despite the certain death that awaits them, two of the crew summon their samurai courage and choose to return to Earth anyway to face the music, and thus provide a more intimate setting for the remaining male captain and female subordinate (dim the lights & cue Marvin Gaye - ""Let's get it on"").These last two plan to return to the Jovian moon from whence they came, to populate it in their new roles as Adam and Eve to restart humanity. Interestingly, the woman subordinate is ALREADY pregnant - workplace harassment? It's also interesting that it is acceptable for future professional astronauts to get pregnant on missions... on a ship designed for scientific discovery...in outer space ...is a gynecologist on board? A pediatrician? Surgeon? Not sure if the ship has a maternity ward or facilities for daycare or childbirth (actually we are - nope!) ... what if mommy and daddy want to go on parental leave after they are done dodging asteroids for the week? Let's leave all those questions floating in space, please. I guess abstinence, birth control, professional mission discipline doesn't exist in the future, at least one envisioned by Clooney, who also directs what passes for a film.And that is pretty much it. Two survivors of humanity. With limited provisions. Going back to an alien moon to, presumably, screw away until the end of days, content they are doing it for the greater good. Not a bad way to go if you ask me. No thought though to the size of the gene pool? How are two people by themselves supposed to restart the human race? Heavy use of CRISPR? The departing suicidal crew members do not even have the courtesy to leave behind their reproductive DNA (at least not on camera). What about Earth's accumulated knowledge base: technological know-how, the arts, the humanities & other ark-like collectibles that may be required to start a colony that is man's last gasp for survival. You know, if you're back near Earth, you might wanna pick some of these things up? Even electronically? Before the planet disappears for good? Not even some Viagra guys? How about milk and groceries? Maybe even some livestock? Not even medicines?There are more plot holes in this movie than craters on the moon. The biggest one: why this movie was ever greenlit. But in the end, the movie is not meant to be a disaster epic. It just exists to guilt you into realizing we're really messing up the planet. You are left to connect the dots from there to the burning of the Amazon (the forest, not the company). I'm guessing a run on Fox was never planned.Probably the best thing about this movie was the cute kid, probably because she says and does nothing. Because she turns out to be a hallucination (a Sixth Sense style ghost?), a reminder that Clooney was a really bad father but one who created an awesome daughter who now pilots the aforementioned spaceship, which he had forgot about but serendipitously remembered in the knick of time to redeem himself, thanks to a game of solitaire. A hallucination she is, just like we end up hoping the movie turns out to be, because it is impossible to fathom how such a god-awful movie could be real.With the high-profile releases of Tenet and now this abomination, maybe it is about time we recognize the editors, producers, writers & directors who take advantage of us forcibly transmogrified into couch potatoes during the Covid crisis, who think we will gullibly swallow anything their not so creative minds can barf up. They feel we shall simply marvel at how clever, witty & deep the plot & acting are, simply because they are incomprehensible & utterly impenetrable, & how thought-provoking their ideas & themes relating to humanity are dealt with through metaphors that in actuality are just pot-inspired time-fillers.In short, they have gift wrapped their ill-thought-out and foul-smelling turds with fancy bows, made a fuss of the presentation & placed them under our plastic Christmas trees. Perhaps realizing that in the present zeitgeist, people can't even agree on basic tenets of reality (pun intended), they figured why then should we bother with critiquing mediocre fiction? It certainly seems to be a plausible thought process behind Midnight Sky and Tenet (to which Sky plays the dumber, poorer brother) - but both are equally absurd and nonsensical in their own right, yet filled to the brim with melancholic, illogical, non-sensical self-importance.But to the Hollywood elites who want to foist their garbage onto us, the hoi polloi, let me say, dammit, some of us do give a damn! Really, we do! We will not settle for turds disguised in Rolex boxes, no matter how pretty, or how expensive they look. We will not give in. We will put up a fight. We will not go gently into the night! We will not let utter trash assail our senses and sight! We demand movies with some substance. We demand quality. We demand a plot for chrissakes! A new Zen-processor or cutting edge Nvidia graphics at the editors' desk does NOT mean you can leave the story completely by the wayside.Net of it is that Midnight Sky is nothing but a Clooney sized dump... not the soft plop plop of gently laid turds followed by a long flush... this is instead the full-on firehose fury of an exceptionally muscular rectum pressurized by prescription-strength laxative suppositories, unleashed in an unholy mess.

324,deager,Hope...it is all about hope.,8,27 December 2020,"Let's just throw away all those reviews about the lack of action, nothing happens, boring, etc. If you read anything about this movie or watched a trailer you would get a hint that action wasn't its main plot line and you would get a idea it was about watching something unfold, a drama maybe, a story about people in a untenable situation perhaps? But, I will say this, the part of the movie that included the first meteor shower and then the second are some of the best you will ever see. And the scene with the death of a crew member was as tense and real as you could want. Then you had the blizzard and the sinking wayside shed to add to the action. So there were plenty of tense, exciting moments.
At the heart of this movie was hope. At every turn the underlying theme was hope. From the very beginning, with Augustine's (Clooney) decision to stay behind and die from his cancer alone. Their was a hidden line of hope. When he would lay back an stare into space, at Mars. You could find hope throughout the movie as everything seemed it's bleakest. If you view the movie with an open mind, with an eye towards what is behind the plot I think you will find more than you think.
Clooney surrounds himself with top notch actors who truly believe in the story they are telling and help weave the various plot points into a believable story. It is a well written story and the visual effects are stunning in their realism. The photography plays no tricks, but guides the story, framing it perfectly.
I felt the movie was probably a 9, my partner was nearer to a 10. But I did feel that the end was a bit too syrupy, even though it had a nice twist. Also there was a bit of the sinking shed that was just a bit to pat.
But I still think it was a beautiful story of hope told well. And as the last to lines of the story go (I will not say who speak them as not to give away to much) spoken as plainly as if they were passing on the time of day, you will see why hope is always there -

The simple fact is that any planets with any chance of supporting life, are light years away, i.e. somewhere we can never really get toAnd Clooney's big ""climax"" radio transmission - because ""he wanted to help"" - is pathetic and bizarre. The astronauts deserve and clearly want a clearer, more detailed explanation of earth's condition, and any chances they'd have of safe entry. But Clooney offers them nothing, just saying ""nowhere"" and ""I'm sorry"". And why the eff doesn't he tell the female astronaut that he's her father?

Giving off a similar mood and tone to the movie Ad Astra and even the once popular video game Tacoma, the film feels long drawn out but never loses your attention.
I found myself very captivated throughout the film. The trick to enjoying it was going in, merely watching it with no expectations and understanding that it's simply just a movie.
The story was also simple enough for a movie of this genre. It's simplicity made the film all the more mesmerizing and quiet frankly kept me interested.
Acting was very solid, which is something I'm not surprised by being that George Clooney Directed the film. Nothing felt fake and had a genuineness to it all, even if the things the characters were doing were necessarily logical.
I guess the movie isn't for everyone. But if you loved Ad Astra, hopefully you can get a kick out of this one. A sense of sci-fi that isn't always action-packed is what you will get here, and it does it really well!

Masculinity represented by the movie makers: George Clooney and Mark L. Smith and femininity by the actual writer of the story: Lily Brooks-Dalton. Masculinity also represented by the visuals; both on earth as well as outer space, extremely impressive objects and scenery. The story clearly represents the femininity. I compare this blend of masculinity and femininity with the irritating regular quarrels between husbands and wives; the husband has the need to be right and the wife has the need to feel something. In the end to me the point of the story was all about the effects of priorities in life and how they manifest in what could be considered as one of the most extreme situations in life, which in these days might be more actual than we would like.

339,geekgirl101,A waste of 2 hours of my life,2,26 December 2020,"This was so utterly awful that I couldn't watch it to the end, but my husband who endured the suffering filled me in on it with much regret. The plot is awful, the acting is awful, the science non-existent, and the ending was completely pointless.So here's a summary of the film - everybody on Earth is dead except an old guy with a life threatening condition and an imaginary girl who are at a space station somewhere in the Arctic (we don't know why everyone's dead or why he's the only survivor and we'll never find out.) A small team of astronauts who've been investigating a fictional Earth-like moon dubbed K-32 orbiting Jupiter are returning back to Earth and receive a signal (in real time ofc) from the old guy who eventually reveals that everybody's dead. They tell the old guy to make a pointless journey to a nearby weather station because the communication signal there is stronger (yeah right!) So he spends the next couple of days journeying through a horrendous blizzard where he rarely ever shows signs of the freezing conditions, almost drowns after sleeping in a cabin that's been sitting on thin ice (and comes out of it dry) and loses his only supply of medication he needs to survive.Meanwhile on the spacecraft gravity seems to decide when it's convenient as the crew are seen either floating in airlocks and tunnels or walking around a huge bridge area and drinking coffee. Disasters come as waves of space snowballs which have no effect on the spacecraft which seems to be made out of a metal cage covered in thin cloth, yet they manage to totally smash up key devices such as their radar, solar panels and communications antenna (which somehow magically reappears later on.)In the end they don't rescue the old man but dump 2 of their crew back on Earth - one of whom is a doctor - whilst the others turn back to K-23. Ah yes, I forgot to mention that one of the crew members in the return party is pregnant, so any complications during her pregnancy on her way back means she and/or her baby could die since they now don't have a doctor; but it's likely they'll die from starvation anyways as there won't be any food on K-23. As for the ones back on Earth they too are gonna die because they're all guys and you can't repopulate the human species with a sausage party.This film is 2020 in a nutshell - everybody's dead and those who aren't are gonna die anyways.

So we just accept something happened in which Clooney and the Jetsons are the last humans.The star ship crew consists of 5 members in a ship that rivals the size of USS Enterprise. At least Star Trek acknowledges that you need full navigation, engine room, commissary, maintenance, communications etc crews for a ship of that size and a for mission of that importance. In this movie, the skeleton crew actually have way too much idle time while hurtling through space. And speaking of the ship, what is the deal with interiors looking like a luxury apartment building. The 5 crew members can play hide n seek on this ship and never find each other.The middle of the movie bears to load to keep us interested but just made me squirm and curse at the tv. It is the Arctic after all, you have to ask why would scientists decided to build the most advanced antenna here on a lake. The place is subject to ravaging snow storms with no source of electricity and remember its on a lake. The other troubling part of the story is with the Aether ship and crew.

Many people who watch this movie to the end will still not understand what happened in the movie or why. Why is the little girl in the movie? That's a common question and there really is no answer. Because she contributes absolutely nothing to the film. Movie goers have been even asking if she was even real or just an imaginary companion for Clooney's character. That's how meaningless the girl's character is. They jump from location to completely different location in the movie until you are dizzy. Without any real connection of the dialog to connect the scenes. You're in the Arctic. Then you're in outer space for 120 seconds. Then you're somewhere else 120 seconds later where the weather seems normal and people are driving their SUV's to work at the observatory. Confusing since the set-up for the movie has everybody moving underground because of an apocalypse. Again, a happening they never explain. They they jump back to the Arctic again 2 minutes after that. Is this is a flashback? Who knows? Are they in linear time? In the future, in the past? Who knows? Because it seems George Clooney wanted this to be a film with vagueness and leave the viewer puzzled. So he has it jumping all the over the place. What was the purpose of the dying man in the wrecked plane? And isn't it kind of stupid to think that the wolves nearby wouldn't have gotten to him? He can't even move. They never, ever explained what that was all about and why it was even in the film. And this is what often happens when actors gain control of a film's production. They end up making art pieces for other people in the craft to marvel at how deep and artistic they are. IN this film there is absolutely zero explanation of where they are taking you.

Most of the time I felt as if I was wanting more from this movie as it never really takes off. The time flashes really had me lost because I was so confused on why they would just have someone who doesn't even look like Clooney play a younger version of him.The Acting: The acting was really well done as it was filled with a pretty well known and star studded cast.

It is very slow. That doesn't always bother me IF in the end it actually goes somewhere. This movie never really does. And there were many unanswered questions in this movie. First, what happened to destroy the earth? Why were the people leaving the Antarctic if the earth had become uninhabitable and the people elsewhere were dead and/or dying? Later in the move, more plot holes... Why did two of the crew choose to go back to an earth where virtually everyone was dead or dying and had become uninhabitable? And how on earth were the the two remaining crew members suppose to populate that new planet they were going back to? She is pregnant, yes. But even if they had more kids there would be no one for them to repopulate with outside of incest and that is, well, gross. So one day the parents will die, the kids will grow old and die and that will be that. And how are two crew members supposed to handle navigating that space ship where previously it took a crew of five? And the final straw?

George Clooney admits he wants to remain at a space station that will keep him isolated and alone and where he continued slowly dying with a terminal kidney disease. Meeting suddenly, without warning, Clooney stumbles upon a seven or eight-year-old girl who either will not talk or cannot talk named Iris. I suppose that is the one relationship capable of building in a fatherly fashion. Trying to figure out the goals of this scattered mass of floating humanz across space is not easy. Has Earth Decayed to the point where they had to leave it to find better accommodations on another planet? That seems to be the case with one spaceship that took off to a moon orbiting Jupiter thought to contain a similar atmosphere and environment that presumed to allow humans to live on,but apparently that was not the case once they arrived, and so they fled to find contact eith a more supportive planetary home.

411,arsenick,The old man and the stars,7,29 December 2020,"I enjoyed watching this movie despite its slowness (but 2001 space odyssey was slow , wasn't it?). I liked it better than Gravity.
Clooney is definitely a moral director : delivering messages about earth sustainability, life (living its real life rather than always working and not prioritizing hopes), but this movie is not black and white. The finale may be predictable but not entirely.
The arctic adventures and the space ones are both adventures in an hard and lonely environment, forgotten by the world , but are the only two remaining and living areas. Clooney is alone while the astronauts are together and form a good team, almost a family.
I wonder wether the young girl with Clooney is real or not (I guess not, actually , in a ""6th sense"" fashion). Loneliness may create hallucinations.

412,gregmalone1,"Opening half is great, falls apart after that. Awful logic and science to boot.",6,24 December 2020,"I thought I was watching a great movie in The Midnight Sky until the mid-to-final act kicked in. Then it started to fall apart story-wise. To be clear, Clooney's performance was superb. The cinematography and editing were top notch too.But then about half-way through the story suddenly departs from Clooney's situation and moves out into space aboard the returning spaceship and doesn't even look back at Clooney for a very very long time. Was a bit jarring, almost as if a different movie had started up while you sneezed.But here's where it went especially haywire for me. Spoiler ahead.First, this movie knows *nothing* about basic science. The best sci-fi has actual ""sci"" in it. But not here. It opens with the year ""2049"" title card -- not only part of the name of another movie (Blade Runner), but ridiculous given it's only a little more than 25 years from now and lo-and-behold we've got space ships with people and colonies ready to settle a ""newly discovered"" moon of Jupiter that happens to be Earth-like. And mind blowing spaceships that any advanced civilization would crave. In 2049. Yeah right. Why do filmmakers do that? Treat 20 yrs into the future like we're all going to be in flying cars and on distant planets? Clearly they skipped science class in high school. And why doesn't *somebody* from the gaffer up to the numerous Executive Producers say something about that? Make them all look like fools.But then in the end, after we've seen poignantly how every crew member on the spaceship is essential to maintaining it, two of them announce they're going to get off during the slingshot around the destroyed Earth to find their dead families. Yeah, really? And take one of two space shuttles for the purpose? And leave the remaining two crew members (a third had already died) to run the ship and settle the Jupiter moon by themselves after a long return trip back? Right. And the two that stayed on the ship never once tried to argue for all to stay onboard because basically everyone's going to die if any of them leave the ship. Right. Pure nonsense. Why didn't *somebody* from the gaffer to one of the Executive Producers raise the red flag on such foolish writing?And then, stunningly, you're thrown back into flashbacks of a younger Clooney that you don't (at least I didn't) realize was a younger Clooney because they used a different actor (Spock!) that doesn't look anything like Clooney... oh my gawd, so poorly handled and only revealed in the closing credits that Spock (Ethan Peck) was playing a young Clooney character... until then I didn't even know it.And, really sadly, in the final scenes when it's obtusely and oddly revealed that the little girl Clooney's been with is really the lady on the spaceship, it's so poorly set up and explained that it becomes, in my opinion, a wasted effort altogether. What is that you say, again?! She's WHO? Uhhh... does not compute. Even if you were imagining her, it has no useful logic or ""ah hah"" moment or epiphany to it. They really blew it.So, my take is that there are two, maybe three actual movies here, rolled into one that starts well and ends in a mess. Bummer. Because I really liked where it was heading initially. And I truly enjoyed Clooney's performance despite the absurdity during the last half.",The Midnight Sky

seizing the moment, some people are right now giving away their whole lives to fight for something that other people don't even value - physicists, biologists, ecologists, etc. - people who are gaining the knowledge on how we can survive and thrive not only as individuals, but as humanity as a whole. These people who do not devote their whole life for consumption, rather devote themselves to creating and making new things, discovering new things. These are the people we should listen to and follow. While most of people rather care about hatered, looking for someone to blame for some silly material stuff that doesn't really matter. I see this movie is not really a sci-fi I was hoping to see, still it was a good watch and it provokes thoughs people need to have the sooner the better.",The Midnight Sky

While alone in his Arctic station, Clooney finds a young girl who he figures must have been left after a frantic evacuation.After a reluctance to care for the girl, Clooney soon finds he enjoys her company and together they set off across the Arctic towards a communication station in an attempt to make contact with the other remaining humans to see if he can get the girl back to her family.Meanwhile, a space mission exploring a habitable moon of Jupiter's is trying to make contact with Earth not realizing that most of Earth is wiped out. As expected, many problems occur as the spaceship returns to Earth.While some of the scenes were beautifully shot like scenes in the Arctic and in space, 'Midnight Sky' just lacked a clear storyline. The viewer was blind to what was going on for good chunks of the film. It wasn't clear how what Clooney was doing on Earth related to what was happening on the space mission. This movie felt a lot like Clooney copied Gravity, the Martian, and the Empire Strikes Back and tried to turn it into another overcoming hardships sci-fi flick. It doesn't work. It doesn't even come close to the movies mentioned.The lack of clear plot was a major sticking point, but the sci-fi cliches and the fact that hypothermia apparently has been cured in 2049 really turned this movie into a pile of you know what.",The Midnight Sky

Everything you want to see in a film like this never happens/wasn't shown. It felt like unimportant scenes were dragged out and ultimately it had really glaring pacing issues. It's a movie that very little happens. The prequel or sequel of this would have been a better story and more exciting.There were some great visuals throughout the film, which is a pro.

First off the FX are great, There has been a lot of money thrown at this film and its there on screen. The acting is good and GC puts in a great performance as our terminally ill protagonist. The big picture idea behind the film is a good one and there is a decent reveal at the end.
Well that's the end of the good stuff.Cons.
First off they should have had a scientific advisor on the film. The science just isn't there. The basic premise an undiscovered moon around Jupiter that is habitable on the surface. Are you sure? Even little things like no lag between earth and the spaceship communications WTF.
Horrible jarring plot holes. Poorly paced. Slooooooow very sloooooow. Yes its apocalyptical, but there is no chance of any redemption doesn't make for great viewing. If you want to hammer an environmental agenda you can do it much more subtly way than this. The big elephant in the room, Felicity Jones being pregnant at the start of filming and writing it into the script. An astronaut gets pregnant on a dangerous 2 year mission and no one seems to bat an eyelid. Surely this could have been filmed in such a way as not to show her pregnant at least to give some semblance of reality or at least save it for the end as bit of hope for the survival of the species.To sum up. This could have been a lot better faster a bit more science and maybe the event being explained a bit more.",The Midnight Sky

I think we can all agree that Earth is magnificent. It's quite possibly a miracle. There are people trying to figure that out while you and I watch Netflix movies and then leave reviews. I found myself ""trying"" to think like those people. I put myself on that ship and on Earth and what would I do and how would I feel.

Some say that the extended scenes of the spaceship bogged down the movie experience, but I think that it was a nice interlude for the scenes with George Clooney.I think that there should have definitely been less scenes of the spaceship because they show us all of these characters but not enough depth for us to enjoy them. It all leads up to the death of the girl (which was really cool even though I can't even remember their names) and the two spacemen going to earth while the other two remain.The ending on the spaceship was definitely disappointing because I felt that there was literally nothing that led up to it before the last 5 minutes.My final point is the ending on George Clooney's side. The aha moment that they were going for definitely was a let down but I did get an explanation for why Iris never talked when George Clooney could've definitely used her help.Overall, if you can look past the ignorance in some space/arctic scenes, George Clooney fans can enjoy this movie.",The Midnight Sky

The journey of a father and his attempt at redemption.Once you notice how close this is in similarity to gravity you begin to compare. Really the first thing with Midnight Sky is that its VERY slow, the first hour has very little progression into the story. There are NOT any layers into why the earth is doing what its doing, just that its happening... the end of that plot line. No hope if offered for redemption for earth. Really wasn't even suggested that we did it to the planet, just that we didn't do a good job?So earth is doomed and we are left with a space program coming back who for some apparent reason had absolutely no clue it was happening, or any questions as to why it happened when they finally make contact. There question is there a place to land? That would not be my first question. There was a lot of illogical choices like that is this movie. The fact that they got a message from a family member but NOT a SINGLE message from NASA of what they were coming home to? They wanted the viewer to focus on the non-sci-if part, humanities last humans.I think the idea is good, but for sure not a 2 hour movie. The pensive tracking through blizzards and other type scenes went on way to long and added little to the drama but frustration at how long it was taking.The story of the daughter was very good and added a sixth sense feel at the end. The fact that he was placing his daughter with him was a nice gotcha made you see why he was doing what he was doing.This movie is so heavily leaning toward to journey of the father and the sci-fi is about 5% of the movie.

George Clooney plays the main character, a scientist who has devoted his life in pursuit and beleive in finding another habitable planet for human race's future survival. And along the way chose his work over his family. The story captures the character's devotion towards his field and his longing for his family, till the very end where he is terminally ill and life on earth has no hope. In an interesting and touching twist of fate, the end gives meaning to all that he has sacrificed and worked for, with his daughter taking the humanity's last hope forward. The story moves in a subtle way not being overly dramatic, however still blending amazing visuals, intensity and strong performances, specially by Clooney himself. For me somehow the subplots in space like loosing the young astronaut, space debris etc were unwanted diversions and usual tropes, which held me from getting immersed into the main characters journey, it wasn't needed. The story is about human endeavour, love, longing and meaning. For that its worth watching. Just wish it had created more room for emotional engagement.",The Midnight Sky

In the opening credits, the screen writer's name shows up in white text on a white background, you can't really read it. Once you watch the movie, you will understand why they would want to hide their name.For two hours, we watch George Clooney, apparently dying of cancer and in a hideously harsh climate, some how find an inexplicably located observatory, so he can warn people on a space ship not to return to earth, that is now toast for some reason (they couldn't even think up a cause of our demise) because somehow he is related to the mission and the crew. He is accompanied by a ghost, or hallucination who somehow helps pull him from freezing water so his clothes can magically dry in the 60 mile an hour winds.In addition to the ridiculous scenes, the editing and pacing is bizarre. They flip back repeatedly to a couple who we suppose to be younger version of George's character (because he too has a beard, but otherwise bears no resemblance to Mr. Clooney whatsoever and sure doesn't have that voice) and the mood is all regret and lost love, but other than that, no idea what they are there for.Five astronauts who have been in space for presumably years, but still have nice hair cuts and are clean shaven, join into a rousing version of ""Sweet Caroline"" after their ship is severely damaged in a meteor shower and three members are hanging on to the edge of the ship trying to fix it. Seriously?It goes on and on. Every time a bit of tension builds, it gets short circuited by some irrelevant lengthy conversation between some of the actors.

In his younger life, he was dedicated to his work and pushes his loved ones aside. Now as a dying old man, taking care of and connecting with a little girl is a wonderful redemption for him. This is great, until they reveal the girl is in his imagination. That dissolved all the dramatic weight from it.Instead his redemption is sending a warning to the spaceship. Apparently no one else thought to warn the spaceship that they can't land on earth. NASA must've forgot about their most important mission before going into their bunker.They also needed to explain what was actually happening. Earth is turned into an unlivable wasteland, the only explanation is ""radiation"" as seen on a screen. We needed some explanation, the entire plot rides on this.The spaceship plot was very predictable and dumb. They apparently couldn't see the asteroid fields they flew through, until the rocks started hitting them. And what astronaut would let a pregnant woman expose herself to deadly gamma radiation?

Spaceships have gravity and a great deal of interior space, ruining the tension by not having the small spaces of a real ship, think ISS. Genetics seem to be ignored at the end for emotional sake. As usual Hollywood does not understand how a flight team has to focus when performing a space walk and has the crew singing Neil Diamond when they should be focused on a spacewalk, ruining a whole scene.Really, this is a seriously boring video and Clooney has ruined yet another several million dollars.

I thankfully did not read the reviews first which would have saved me two hours. It is just not worth watching, just too many technical story issues and a sluggish performance by many of the actors. The astronauts were insipid and Clooney was lethargic which may be the most plausible or reasonable if the story would have developed more background on his funk and behavior. But let me say he was perky when he was on the ice. Oh background, yes they should have taken a minute to build in background which would help the viewer move with the movie rather than wonder what the hell is this about?Cut some scenes and write scenes that build depth into the movie. Drop the pregnancy, build upon the scene with Peck to build foundation (it could be considered the focal point of the entire movie) and stop playing old and irrelevant music during a daring and critical spacewalk. Do your work and get back to the airlock. Oh let's put 60% of the crew outside, we don't need them if the worst happens. Get going you captain, the pregnant one and newbie space walker Maya outside in uncharted space (unchartered based on the location they were makes no sense it is unchartered) and make sure you lollygag along. Oh and you have stopped throwing up right? After all is hard to clean up the helmet. Yes that to.What happened? Lack of technical logic, jagged story line moving from scene to scene, scenes that should have been cut.

And so Earth is left with a scientist who is revolutionary and special but we never know why. Cool.Then, in space, we have the most boring space travelers ever. We only see one space walk (and the director thinks it's cool to put Sweet Caroline, a cool but really overused song from the 60's!), two accidents... and that's it? The only action on a different planet lasts around one minute - it's pretty, but that's literaly it! I want to see space drama, cool science, desperation, food shortage, but our space travelers are hit with objects that we have no idea where they came from and watch holograms from their families all the time!An entire science-fiction space adventure movie is focused on two characters, that we barely know! Clooney's life is a mistery, despite some flashbacks; and we never know how Sully became an astronaut, or why, and if they're father and daughter.If this is an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of The Martian and Interstellar, lads, this ain't it. Those movies followed the Mark Twain rule: ""Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please."" Those movies were scientificaly revolutionary and had a brilliant story that distorted slightly the science to its advantage.The Midnight Sky's story is filled with plot-holes, and we are left with believing that a newly-found planet near Jupiter can do the trick.This is an Oscar-nominee simply do to the lack of beautiful science-fiction visuals in the last year.

This was showing in my favourite cinema. Last but not least, what healthy female of the species wouldn't want to see anything with George Clooney, if only to find out whether he can match Sean Connery in aging well? The post-apocalyptic angle interested me; there are books that have done that stupendously (e.g. A Children's Bible) but it wasn't the reason I went.Turns out the movie is about something else entirely. The post-apocalypse part is a dead loss - we have no fertile Planet B to escape to. Still, the end had me howling, for all the predictable and sometimes heavy-handed drama. At the heart of it, this story asks the question: can an absent parent be a good parent? Or even just a good-enough one? While I'm skeptical about the technological lengths Midnight Sky goes to to give its reply, I tend to agree with its conclusion. Then again, wouldn't this be exactly the type of script an absentee parent would write afterwards in self-justification, true or not? Or, for that matter, a neglected child?Our parents are who they are. We cannot change them. We can, however, try to see the good in them.

500,pixfarina,"A Space opera, and not a classic one",2,25 December 2020,"Most of what I will discuss here can be glanced in the trailer. The story of 'The Midnight Sky' revolves around a space exploration vessel returning to earth in the year 2049 after visiting a newly discovered 'habitable' and earth like moon of Jupiter. Scientifically speaking that is a major stretch on a number of levels, but that is only the start of the credulity stretching. But as it is a central plank of this drama, and 'The Midnight Sky' is more a space opera/ drama than a solid addition to the science fiction genre.The back drop of this mission is that the ship is returning to an Earth ravaged and doomed by an unspecified plague of some sort. Given what is happening currently in 2020 the plague is at least interesting. But that in itself is not near enough to rescue this film.For some reason the ship's crew did not expect to be able to contact earth when there were at Jupiter, which is odd as Jupiter is not that far away. So this device is used to establish the fact they are returning, rather unconcerned, blind, to a planet that is doomed. Contrivances like this in the film make it hard to watch, and statistically most of the audience are smarter than this film is.The acting is passable, but only because the script itself was fairly wooden. George Clooney is watchable as ever, I liked his performance and his dedication to sci-fi. But his talent is wasted in a project he had a large hand in brining to the screen.'The Midnight Sky' delivers a predictable ending though there is a slight twist. But this delivers a moment of 'oh' rather an a satisfying 'ah'.The sets and visual effects are excellent, which is the only reason I give it any stars at all. But I wondered why the movie surrounded its fairly accurate space physics with action the events that would look more at home in Star Wars. In this films' version of the future astronomers are obviously blind by profession, as aside from an undiscovered utopian moon around Jupiter they also missed flocks of icy asteroids in 'unexplored regions' of near Earth space. 'The Midnight Sky' may as well have went the whole hog and had sounds effects in the vacuum too.All of this might be excusable if the film delivered engaging drama, but as it does not one has to wonder why it was made at all. Science fiction requires some suspension of disbelief to work. But it cannot work as either science fiction of drama if the abandonment of common sense is also a requirement; which it is. I wanted this film to succeed, I really did, but I am sad that it failed on so many levels. With a currently captive audience, starved of new releases, 'The Midnight Sky' is a major missed opportunity.",The Midnight Sky

How come all flicks with paper-thin characters have the same identical feel-good sequences to fill in where real character development should be?There is a lot of good medium-specific storytelling going on in this film. I can see cinema students studying this turkey for a lot of good art and filmmaking technique. Sadly, stories are not composed of art and filmmaking.I won't bother to go into technical details nor unwrap the colossal holes in the plot.

It's really a human drama that uses elements of sci-fi rather than being a true sci-fi movie - although no doubt some people will find that comment unkind or inaccurate.The unfortunate aspect of the movie is the sense in which it buries the lead - this is a shame, as some real interest could have been generated (Solaris like, as someone mentioned in another review), but this tantalising aspect is under-developed and only really clarifies when it's too late to save the story. So for my money, this movie has missed out on some vital script and story development and internal critique.Maybe some key elements got left on the editing room floor, as there also appears to be a major logic flaw towards the end. Not wanting to create a spoiler, so suffice it to say that, I was baffled by decisions made on the spaceship towards the end - to the extent that I found what transpired there unrealistic, and from a 'crew' perspective, completely unprofessional and compromising of their supposed professionalism.",The Midnight Sky

people are evacuated and a mom recognizes just before she enters the helicopter/plane that her kid is missing, starts to scream but stops as one woman says the kid is on another plane (don't know why this woman is lying)cliché of old dying man with kidkid survives for days, getting herself food, toilet, washing, sleeping, without being noticedcomputer estimates time until they can communicate with the spaceship, but actually the spaceship is still out of reachold man and kid starts travelling to another polar station and meet a dying man, no clue why this should be important to the story rather just filling some screentime with somethingthey want to spend the night in some container, which of course is on breaking ice and sacks into waterthe old man is wearing just a shirt in polar snow storm during the night and doesn't freeze within seconds but also jumps into cold water to dive for some sinking equipment and still survives the night... wet, in a polar snow storm, in the middle of the nightthe old man loses the kid but she just appears again in the morning, no clue what was this about, except both are again surviving a polar nightthey easily walk the rest of the distance to the station they wanted to get to. a distance they probably could have reached the day before with the snowmobile within an hour, but better to camp in a container?!the space ship is hit by ice with the speed of gun bullets but just has minor damageof course the crew is capable of repairing each bit and piece of the space ship, like it is not necessary to have studied those things for years and have special toolsfor repairing they use some equipment that was stolen from earth before, why would someone steal technical equipment?on the outside mission they send the pregnant woman, why not? and also the woman that vomited several times, like it would not probably kill her if she vomits again in the space suitof course there are new ice pieces incoming, exactly when those people are outside and exactly right after they have finished repairs and of course something is jammed so one person is not able to bring herself to safety.of course one person got hit and didn't recognize it (ok because of shock) but didn't even feel the force that would come with being hit by something in spaceand of course this woman dies in the end. don't ask me what all of this contributes to the story
earth is destroyed and very likely all people died but some crew members still want to land on earth... because they are so heroic to die in the moment they step on earth... or mentally sick?! who knowsit is fine for everyone those crew members take away critical knowledge and equipment from the sole survivor of humanitynow the space ship returns back to the moon to build new cradle of humanity, on a moon that is capable of keeping an atmosphere, which is of course breathableso the couple will be new adam & eve, and will have lots of kids, since they don't have TV what else they can do. so 1. generation is save, but who make the generations afterwards? this is illegal in most countries for a reason, for sure not healthy for the gene pool",The Midnight Sky

529,bornskeptic,"Not awful, not good either.",6,21 February 2021,"This movie has been heavily criticized for scientific inaccuracies some of which I understand, some I don't.
The easiest ones to pick on....That huge Jupiter moon just appearing out of nowhere. The protagonist falling into a frozen (and conveniently thawing) lake and not dying immediately. The world's most elegant and inefficiently designed spaceship with enough room for 200 yet has a crew of 5.
The list is endless and a lot of it is simply not forgivable. The ""It's just a movie"" argument has it's limits.
Another hard to tolerate element was the decision making on the part of some characters. Like the two fellows who decided to jump on the shuttle and fly down to earth was simply ridiculous. They could see what happened to the planet, read their instruments and from Augustus' accounting had to know everyone down there was dead. And they were going to join them. What the ###?!
Another critique was the movie being emotionally void and lifeless. I didn't find that too much. I did think the acting was quite good and there were some moments of true emotional impact. If it was a little cold, it was a consequence of a story that can't stay in one place long enough to establish anything.
But I also had a problem with the young girl. Or rather her presence. If she was a figment of Augustus imagination, there should have been NO scenes or shots of her perspective without her father in the scene. Like her approaching that downed plane and seeing the pilot. Never should have happened within the context of who she was. Namely, just in his mind. The movie cheated.
So some unforgivable plots holes, decisions, inaccuracies and cheats made this hard to take seriously. But that stuff didn't ruin it for me. I still enjoyed it.",The Midnight Sky
530,Dimakovtun,"Good idea, poor execution",5,20 February 2021,"The story is quite difficult to follow.

With proper scenes, actual explanation about what's going on, it would be much less confusing. And it's not like there was no time for explanation, because the movie is action-packed. Most of it is filled with insignificant elements that could be skipped or made faster.The biggest problem is unclear focus and poor story delivery. Things that could be improved with a slightly different movie cut. It had a good potential to be 7/10, but doesn't actually deliver. I also got the feeling that it was too much inspired by ""Gravity"", but instead of working on the things that could be better - it took the whole section of the previous movie for reuse in this one.

534,foxtwc,Weak plot points,4,14 June 2021,The movie tries to have heart but it falls flat. Ultimately it's a movie about facing your fate.There are a lot of plot holes and a few character caused emergencies along the way which serve more to frustrate than add to the story.A better/stronger transmitter at a remote ice station to warn a crew on an advanced spacecraft that has the technology to see for themselves what George C is trying to warn them about? The whole plot line collapses as it's irrelevant given meaningful contact was made.when the spacecraft was near orbit anyway. Thanks for risking the kids life for that.The ending .... Still falls flat as the emotional moment fizzles when George can't even bother to tell his kid the truth about her heritage.As for the two going back to live their last years on a distant colony ... what's the point. Their craft is damaged and their return journey success is uncertain given the damage they already sustained and the fact they now have less than half the crew to run this ship. Let alone that you could expect them to not make more dumb fatal mistakes along the way.Frankly if cataclysmic weapons were used that spawned the blast waves that were shown on the ice stations maps ... the entire world would have shook and no communication systems or electronics would be working on earth. Yet the only physical clue George had that the world was damaged was some dead birds who died from bad air. Not even a tremor felt from the impact of a bomb whose blast covered half a continent ... yet some reviewers think the show is scientifically accurate.4 stars only for the little girl who was the only likeable character.

547,erichkaroly,"The Silence, interrupted.",7,29 December 2020,"I've been watching Bergman's films recently, and trying to understand why I am drawn to return to them, even when a first viewing is not always compelling.Here's my theory. Very little happens plot-wise in The Silence, Autumn Sonata, even in the road journey of The Seventh Seal (the three that I've studied so far), but a great deal is revealed psychologically.The difference with many Hollywood films that try on European pacing is that they rely on plot over character. And - of course - tend to insist on a ""happy ending"", or at least a satisfyingly positive resolution.The Americans are more readily enjoyable, immediately satisfying. The stories are clearer, and we don't tend to revisit them to discover further riches as much as to re-experienced the journey. The former - Bergman's oeuvre - is less engaging (at least for me, an American only introduced to foreing films as an adult), but the images, symbols, stay in the mind, and each new look is rewarded with new observations, revelations of meaning, and the pleasures that can be had in moments of quiet joys.It's not that there aren't well-drawn, excellent performances in The Midnight Sky. Our star brings as deeply etched a character as we've seen from him, rich and tragic emotions pulsing beneath the surface. A friend recently observed, after the passing of someone we both loved, that by the time you reach 60 each of us is carrying a load of regret on our backs. Clooney has remarked that he does not often get called upon to portray strongly emotional work, yet it's all there behind the eyes, in his tired limbs, his gait and stance.But there's very little conflict, or very little 'fight' in the conflict - and then, such growth is used to indicate perfect emotional resolution. The growth comes through plot, and there's the difference.In The Silence, two sisters in psychological opposition struggle to maintain some semblance of a stifling relationship, and fail. Missing the opportunity to see themselves in the other, neither grows, and they depart. Only the young boy's future remains in some hopeful version of the future, but even he has learned to hide his feelings. He has changed, grown, but there is no promise of a better outcome. The real contrast is between the drama of the main characters and the background life of the minor players they encounter in the hotel.Here, Clooney and the young girl. also opposites, are rather forced to see themselves more honestly in their confinement together. The introverted and near misanthropic scientist, now deprived of his life-long work (there's little left to do, mere days before the apocalypse) is ready for the end. In these last moments God laughs and his plans are interrupted. Unable to abandon a child, he must rally a part of his self he has kept in abeyance, and the physical journey reflects the psychological one.The girl, typically wise beyond her years in American films, is likewise forced to come of age through circumstances, and no doubt she is sadder at the story's end, just as the old scientist is more at peace for his efforts.The detective in a Belgian series I've been watching, The Break, observes that people ""never change"". Which one is true, or truer - Bergman's (& the Belgian detective's) view? or the American one, Clooney's (he directed)....",The Midnight Sky
548,wolfrahms,They done cloonied it up!,5,26 December 2020,"Chris Hadfield, who is a real astronaut, already set the record straight on several of the mistakes they made i Gravity. Now, I'm not blaming George Clooney for the mistakes in Gravity, but when Clooney decided to make this movie, he apparantly called the folks who made Gravity and not Chris Hadfield.When a spacecraft is approaching Earth at 48,000 km/h and encounters meteorites, it's not going to look like there's a guy in front of the spacecraft throwing snowballs at it. Those meteorites are going to be tiny, far between, and they'll whizz by at incredible speed, punching little holes in the spacecraft if any of them hit.Getting the science wrong is, quite frankly, disresptful to the astronauts at ISS who regularly deal with tiny meteorites and other difficulties that the crew of a fictional interplanetary spacecraft would also face. Also, viewers are not ignorant about science like we we're 20 years ago. We know things. We've seen stuff. Specifically, hours upon hours of documentaries and science programs. The cat is out of the bag.When a person suffers a stabbing wound, they typically feel that immidiatly. Not 2 minutes later. If an astronaut was to suffer a wound while spacewalking, I would assume that their suit would be lazerated and immidiatly decompress, quickly killing the astronaut. And now we have a problem, don't we? Sure, we get our big emotional moment, but the magic is gone - the spell is broken. The scientific inaccuracy killed it. You used up all your suspension of disbelief credit when you told us that: ""BTW, there's a large moon orbiting Juptiter that nobody has seen before, and it can sustain life.""GIANT FACEPALMIn the end, the story is not very compelling. The little girl turns out to not be real, but a memory of Augustines daughter, Iris. The couple that we see arguing a few times in the movie is Augustine and a woman who turns out to be the mother of Iris, a crew member on the spacecraft. Oh, OK. The family drama seems kind of forced into the story. So what happens next? Two of the crew members decide to fly into an irridiated mushroom cloud - to die, I guess. Iris and the captain return to K23, I guess.The production value is very high. The movie does have its moments. But if you're making a movie about the apocalypse... show us something haunting!

How do the negative nellies not recognize a lifetime of regret, while meeting certain death/terminal illness death??He found Earth 2.0. It was necessary to do so. While pitching it, he met the love of his life - whom he pushed away, because he felt time spent to it would take away from his work.His SO lies about not being pregnant as she knew he was trying to cut all ties with relationships and emotional attachments. Which is why he asks later when he knows the score, if his daughter knew about him, while ignoring his child, and associated responsibilities.So now all alone...never so alone in a lifetime, he feels his regrets to living a real life, as his SO lamented before. His mind wanders to the ""what if"" - he could have spent time with her like he knows he should have. What if his SO could still be alive and well if he'd maintained a decent relationship with her.A lifetime of regrets, along with his terminal status, manifest his daughter as real and accompanying him on his journey of the last days.

I liked the pace and the cross-edit, which increases in a more dramatical way. Well produced, well acted, with decent space equipment and machinery that will adorn the environment of a semi-sci-fi movie. In addition, I think the film escalates pretty normally in terms of ""keeping the hook"" and the plot is all about the human struggle; who cares what really happened down there? Who knows what's happening every single day of our lives down here? There's something going wrong, that's it. So let them try to figure out how to stay alive.
I don't really know about ""all the scientific elements gone bananas"" here - as a matter of fact, I haven't noticed any, but then again I am not working at a space lab, or NASA for that matter. To me, it was fine.

This movie is full of the usual cliche's, contrived drama and somewhat dislikeable characters like the hero. It's as if Hollywood can't find anyone who can actually figure out that you can only rehash the same tired story line for so long without people catching on that you haven't had an original thought since 1998.Now with that being said the only logical reason George Clooney who's movie career was once at the pinnacle of the business has for making as many,(i'll call them unique rather than bad) sci fi movies as he has is that he and Kevin Costner have some kind of weird bet that as to which one can make the most uninspiring drivel possible. So far Costner is in the lead with such classics as The Postman and Water world but, if this keeps up George should pass him permanently with the next couple of movies.So with this one I'll say it's buyer beware. If you have nothing to watch and can stomach the plot from every decent Sci Fi movie jammed into one contrived mess then this is the movie for you.

Goes to say without a doubt that the effects are spectacular. Ice, space, above, below, all good.But the script seems to let all good efforts and money down.Great setting of scene, but the girl possibly having been left behind is the vital turning point for a untrustworthy storyteller. Without this we would have no reason to root for Clooneys character. Which turns out to be a story of regret - what he Would have done, Had he been like he is today. And once we reach the conclusion to the technical story - the contact between the remaining vessel and Earth - the girl vanishes. And the whole story turns highly Biblical, even more so than prior to this, as he finds redemption by being driven to ""think of other people"", ie. the girl and the people on the vessel, and try to give humanity a fresh start. Even though the odds are most likely only ""continuing to live now rather than dying now"". But as HE was the one believing in the discovered planet just visited, it is only fitting that he saved his daughter and grandchild IN THE FUTURE. Or rather: Gave her and the child's father a place to go to. ""If not the whole of humanity, we will just start over with 3 people. And then the father has to impregnated the (as yet unborn) daughter, once she reaches maturity, or some un-mentioned embryo-growing facility is on the cutting room floor too, or they forgot to mention the fact, while leaving a door open to all the things they will expose their own children to in the name of furthered humanity... (doesn't take too much speculation in order to come up with the consequences of being only 3 people on an otherwise unpopulated planet.And then there is the ""event"" causing the destruction of the Earth, which is never explained. Such you can get away with, if your allegory is bigger, stronger and more valuable than any (humongous) plot device. THIS is not the case here, though. Every human dies, and the second last story told is of redemption and the biological imperative with a little darwinistic-deselection-of-the-weak and family unit of soon-to-be-three thrown in.And if that is not enough the script wavers and lingers from action into almost standstill, while new information to feed the coming action is delivered.It is a BAD movie, and much more so in light of all the wasted energy. I watch a LOT of movies. I consult resources, I write my own stories, I know storytelling. And I am flummoxed by the fact that this script AS IS SEEN HERE was ever produced. Or does it reside on the cutting room floor? The little girl Clooney's character saves may have been a real one rather than an imagined so, and test audiences found the fact that the little girl had to die also less than enticing, so they made her into an imaginative one in order to make a moment, where Clooneys character might be the actual father of the saved woman in space.Looking at the whole film AS IF she was in fact alive rather than imagined, makes a whole lot more sense, when you look at all the actual hardship Clooney's character endures in order to cope with bringing the girl along In order to save the remaining humans in space.But that still leaves the pacing of the movie etc.Glad I watched it, but annoyed I might never or just in a long time discover the actual story behind this idea to portray the biological imperative in this way.(Sorry for the inspirations scattered all over the place, tried to keep it unspoiled for as long as possbile, and can't be bothered to go back and polish it).",The Midnight Sky

Further, the thought of watching him navigate a snowy environment, with a little girl, simply to reach a radio tower, while astronauts waited miles above the Earth, felt contrived and already overdone. I couldn't have been more wrong.Yes, this film is a bit of a contrived survival film. Yes, at times it appears to be a confused science fiction adventure. But at its heart, it is a redemption film for Augustine. It is a wonderful redemption film at that with a surprise ending on a level of Shamalan's Sixth Sense and Signs.

588,rosadorico,Not A Space or an Apocalypse Movie,4,29 December 2020,"This movie had potential to be something more about dealing with regrets at the end of our days. With a few cinematic scenes and cool VFX thrown in sparingly, it could've even been so on a very modest budget. Perhaps even a single room drama set to the desolate background of the frozen arctic would be more identifiable to viewers than what was presented here. Instead, it seemed to have used George Clooney's star power to throw out huge dollars to make a movie that never becomes the big budget Psy-Drama that had gained popularity since the ""Bird Box"" movie.First, this movie never embraces any genre fully enough to build any real drama or obstacles, but rather uses cliché tropes that can be seen from miles away. Unlike the futuristic spaceship radar that can't seem to see meteors until they're hitting the ship. But I'll come back to that. The forced tension is so palpable in this film that every opposition is met with eye rolls instead of gasps. From knowing which characters are meant to die and even what the ""twist"" will turn out to be. You are never left feeling or even wanting to know what happens next.Okay, but IMO, the biggest drawback of this entire movie is the necessity of the viewer to believe in inner-planetary travel yet completely disregard rudimentary understanding of weather, or technology or human anatomy or any sort of basic common sense.An elderly cancer patient in subzero temps will die of hypothermia in minutes. They will not be able to traverse for miles in an Arctic blizzard with enough strength to fight wolves. A spacesuit that gets punctured by a meteorite traveling at thousands of mph will not be casually noticed a few minutes later by a few floating blood globes. A crew of astronauts returning from Jupiter towards Earth will not get lost. And the technology that allowed such travel would not only not work until it suited the plot or be as useless to not even detect what was immediately around the Earth's orbit.In summary, I'll repeat. This movie could have been a great character film dealing with a dying man's regrets of the choices he made choosing his career over his family. Perhaps even showing that his own loss, however tragic, proves to serve a purpose as to save the last of humanity at least has merit. Instead we are left with a movie that never delivers on any front so the viewer is left with no real feeling at all.",The Midnight Sky

The astronauts behave like highly trained, intelligent humans overcoming various struggles. The Spaceship design is top notch, and the visual effects are spectacular.

645,headsign,Where to start?,4,25 December 2020,"This film feels like a loosely stitched collection of ideas on how to please a certain public, by putting them in a place they like. That of slow, cerebral science fiction. Only that this production doesn't make much sense, in terms of plot. It's somewhat emotional but with a constant feeling of déjà-vu. We like Clooney in the centre of what would be the plot, but in the end, it's just a sequence of sceneries and images.
To make it worse, the film has very questionable design choices. A hodgepodge of styles from the last 50 years. The preference for organic patterns in a futuristic spacecraft, the see-through displays ... everything seems somewhat incoherent and misplaced. Add some rather cheap CGI, specially with the views of the habitable planet.
Of course, there is the inevitable space walk scene, with an ending so foreseeable that it made me exhaust a deep sigh. I'm not going to spoil any more. It's not going to be the only foreseeable scene.
Watch this film if, like myself, you're very bored, you like the genre and also George Clooney. Don't expect much. It has, I must admit, its enjoyable moments. But these are very rare and quite overweighted by the annoying ones.
This feels like a typical production aimed at grooming a certain audience, all while underestimating it. One of these films that made me rush straight to IMDB, only to see if I was one of the few or one of the many who disliked it. Obviously, I'm one of the many.",The Midnight Sky

That said there are plenty of tense moments and you never quite know what to expect next.

692,valeriorinaldi-36361,Too Little for Too Long,3,24 December 2020,"""The Midnight Sky,"" a catastrophic science-fiction tale directed by George Clooney and based on Lily Brooks-Dalton's novel ""Good morning, Midnight,"" is about an emotional and physical journey. After a mysterious cataclysm has wiped out most of life on Earth, Augustine (George Clooney), a seriously ill astronomer who has spent his life looking for a hospitable exoplanet, refuses to escape with a group of survivors and is left alone in an Arctic scientific-research station. He knows a group of astronauts is traveling back to Earth and since he needs a powerful antenna to communicate with them, he sets off on a perilous journey to reach a far-off base.George Clooney's performance is brilliant, and some scenes are extremely engaging and nerve-wracking. Unfortunately the movie focuses mostly on Augustine's emotional awakening and neglects important aspects of the story. Too many scenes are devoted to his journey and inner struggle and this choice affects the narrative economy of the film. Its pace is slow and its development dispiriting.I would recommend ""The Midnight Sky"" to viewers fond of sentimental stories and not to those eager for action, adventure and the excitement of scientific exploration.",The Midnight Sky

I wish I could rip this film apart or praise it for 500 words but in the end, it comes down to the following; it's two stories mashed together that have been done before and, quite frankly, done better separately. (see the title of this review).The actors were serviceable in their respective roles with no stand out performance. Even George ""Santa Roadwarrior"" Clooney's portrayal of a cancer patient was just lackluster, plus it didn't help when he was able to do activities that no one in his state could do unless they're Jigsaw of course.The story was predictable, with cliche dialogue and character progression. It felt like you could follow the beat of the film while playing on your phone. Even though I called it optimistic the ending doesn't really feel like a happy one. Not spoiling anything, it doesn't leave you with a, ""Well, what will they do now?"" feeling that films like ""Children of Men"" and ""The Road"" leave you with, it just feels, ""Well, we better get back to work.""Honestly, all of this sucks because the film is beautiful. The space scenes were fantastic with really good CGI. The arctic scenes were done well and captured the feeling of being trapped on a sea of ice; although AMC's ""The Terror"" did it better.This movie honestly needed to choose a story and stick with it. Instead, we got the ""meh"" of both worlds for almost 2 hours.

In my opinion, this movie is just plain bad. The sci-fi and Nordic scenes are visual gems. But the story is missing. A good movie doesn't require an elaborate story but a way of telling it in a way that keeps the viewer interested and entertained. This movie has a very simple plot, but nothing is done to make it interesting. The dialog is sparse, the pauses are much too long to be effective drama. Most of the time, the character's expressions are gloomy, which, I'm assuming is meant to be a dramatic tool. But to what end?

No smart dialogues
No smart acting, when you think of it. Clooney is Clooney but in the end, keeping quiet (it is a lot of quietness) doesn't add up too much.
No smart ideas. We're in the age of quantum computing, and I expect some basic knowledge in science should be known.... An undiscovered planet around Jupiter... really? It sounds like ""hey, I just noticed a second car in our garage. How come we didn't see it yet?..."" Heated from inside?... I can't even be sarcastic on this.... All planets over a certain mass are hot inside due to gravitational pressure and in some case due to gravitation interference, but... that seems to be a quite tiny since it was not yet discovered. I can imagine from Galileo's time till now, every time we, the earthlings, pointed a telescope in that direction, the phone rang and we always missed it...

1. Originality - 2
2. Acting -3 (having a beard looking at the sky is not exactly acting)
3. Effects - 7
4. Informative - 0

700,tsode,Ignore low reviews. An intelligent drama about our fragile existence.,8,27 December 2020,"I just got back from seeing The Midnight Sky at a local cinema.My first impression is that if you are a fan of films like ""Contact"" (Robert Zemeckis) or ""Mission to Mars"" (Brian De Palma), and perhaps also ""Solaris"" (the highly underrated Steven Soderbergh version from 2002, which also starred Clooney), then this is a beautiful and emotive film in a similar vein to those classics. I absolutely loved it, from beginning to end.Gorgeously shot, and realistically acted, this is no overblown sci-fi actioner. It's a human drama, set in a possible future. A disastrous, fragile future. Making this a fable about our vulnerability, and our tiny place in the cosmos. And most importantly, the regret we may feel both collectively and individually, from opportunities wasted.I found it profoundly moving at times. And certainly nowhere near as ""slow"" as some gibbons have complained. There are in fact, numerous gripping set pieces that had the audience on edge. The story is divided between action on Earth and aboard a spacecraft. And both have their share of drama and tragedy, hanging on to their existence by a thread of gossamer.The effects and performances were excellent. It was also refreshing to see characters making sensible and logical choices when dealing with life-threatening situations. (Nearly every character in the film is a scientist, after all).Looking at some of the other reviews... the problem in many cases, clearly rests with the viewer's expectations, and not this film. At least the Washington Post got it right - their reviewer Michael O'Sullivan gave it 4 stars out of 5. Entertainment Weekly got it right, too.Have people's attention spans become so short that they cannot appreciate a moderately paced, human/sci-fi drama anymore? Or is this film somehow attracting the wrong audience? Is it a problem with Netflix audiences? (where this film debuted simultaneously, along with a brief cinema run).The Midnight Sky is by no means perfect. But I found it difficult to spot any major flaw in it's pacing, visuals, action, acting, or the delivery of the story it set out to tell. It's not a complicated narrative. It's a straightforward and quite realistic story of survival, set amidst a planetary disaster and a fragile attempt to begin again on another world.If you want explosions and superheros - go elsewhere.
If you can't stop playing with your smartphone for 10 minutes - go elsewhere.But if you appreciate an Arthur C. Clarke or Isaac Asimov style chapter in humanity's (and the individual's) struggle for survival against our collective penchant for self-destruction, then this simple and emotive story is well worth your ticket.",The Midnight Sky

Of course its hard to get excited about a story coming after the total ruin of our planet, looking like all of humanity is going to just be swallowed up in a swirling mass.
I few things kind of I noticed that I would write differently. First, what is the catastrophe. no one talks directly about that? Clooney to the astronauts ""we didnt do a very good job of looking after the place....' So what did we do wrong exactly!
The trailer Clooney and the girl are staying in, for no reason cracks through lake ice in the middle of the night. Then he goes for a swim in the subzero water, comes up and puts his jacket on dries out, in the middle of a serious blizzard. Superhero. Except he's got cancer. I mean really!
Finally, the spaceship apparently has the resources to go back to the moon of Jupiter and start a new colony. Great idea, take as much human gene pool with you as you can. Except two of the four want to hop off on earth and die near their family and leave the other two to fly all the way to salvation on their own. I would have said, no we need you on board, you cant have the landing pod.But dramatically it looks like heroic hopeless loyalty, going home to die with your dead wife's remains, if you can find them.

722,dpincgk-04079,I believe this movie is worth watching but confusing.,7,20 April 2021,"But, only if you have time and are in the correct mood. This is not an action movie, it's not the kind of movie where you are going to get a quick, to the point message. Do not watch if you are looking for humor, or lightness or a solid and quick conclusion. There are a lot of quiet scenes. And the overall atmosphere is quite lonely / depressing. And it is slow, though there are interesting scenes. Once you realize the plot, you will understand the outcome is not going towards a ""save the day"" hero kind of film. All of that said - it is a quality production that is more than well made and the story and the acting are both excellent, it is the kind of movie that makes you think. Unlike some reviews, I do think there are a couple different messages this movie could be considered to convey and this is where it gets confusing to me. Throughout the movie, one message is that the theme of family (and friends) keeps coming up as being of the highest value in different ways. I wonder if they were trying to get across that our personal connection to family and friends is more important than anything else even in the face of the most dire or extreme situation. In contradiction, it clearly it required sacrifice of a family connection, consider George Clooney's character and the importance and focus he kept on his work vs. His relationship - and Felicity Jones's character, etc. And her focus on her mission - to potentially save humanity as we reach the end of the movie.",The Midnight Sky

We experienced this in ""Ad Astra"" or ""Gravity"", for example - and time and again family problems have to be tackled. This is also the case with George Clooney and his Netflix film ""The Midnight Sky"", in which the actor also takes the lead role. As astronomer Augustine Lifthouse, lonely in the Arctic, left behind in a weather station, he no longer expects much from life, he is seriously ill. The year is 2049, a catastrophe, which is only hinted at, has ensured that the earth is uninhabitable. For a while now, humanity has been looking for an exit strategy, and a space mission has just returned from K23, a newly discovered moon, with the realisation that life is not only possible on the blue planet. Besides these two levels, there is a third, set in Lifthouse's past. We get to know a passionate explorer who - long live the cliché - but neglected his family and never established a proper relationship with his daughter. He is able to make up for this - postponed - in the present, as Lifthouse is suddenly surprised in the weather station by a little girl who had been hiding. ""The Midnight Sky"" is a science fiction film and a dystopia, it wants to be an existential drama and a socio-political discourse film full of mawkishness - none of which succeeds.Instead, we see the ""Actuality of Philosophy"" in the form of images.Furthermore, this film is unspeakably slow in telling its story, not knowing what it wants to tell in the first place.",The Midnight Sky

In line with Interstellar or Her, here is science fiction as it should be, in other words: speculative future both for our species and for life as a whole, and that without necessarily being a question of good guys who have to fight bad guys. For that, there are many other genres to let off steam.

733,johanschutten,It's art.,9,23 December 2020,"The Midnight Sky is probably one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's not as action packed as most blockbuster sci-fi movies of late, although it has some rather nice action sequences in it. It is actually rather slow-paced - which I like very much!The story centers around an old dying man (Clooney) and a little girl he finds at the abandoned research station where he's living. The earth is devastated by an extinction level event and he is one of the last remaining people on earth. His mission? To establish contact and possibly save an exploration vessel coming back to our beloved planet from a 2 year exploration trip to one of Jupiters moons.First the bad: the story isn't very spectacular. There are similar movies (like Interstellar and IO) which have the same kind of backstory cq. setting as The Midnight Sky. The end of the movie is interesting, but also not very original - it's all done before (although not in a sci-fi movie, as far as I can remember). And some of the action sequences are just nuts in terms of science.But why then, do I think it's a piece of art? Probably because it sooooo well filmed and edited! Together with the superb music and acting, the movie engulfs you in a type of tension I've not experienced in a long time. I think that is one of the main reasons why you should watch this movie. Not because of the action, not because of the great story, but because of the atmosphere it sets and the way it's filmed, edited and acted. For me, it is a piece of art.",The Midnight Sky

BUT: Why would anyone just want to go home into certain death? And with the girl showing up I immediately knew all including the woman in the ship was his daughter which he wanted to warn. I was also disturbed by him surving the water break and actually believing that this so called plot twist was not totally predictable. And I was also disturbed by the fact that he bought her time but humanity still will extinct. So: all total useless. But yes: he finally learned that he better would have spent time with his daughter? Quite a lot around this trivial learning. Really a pity. There are so many great sci fi books that could be filmed.

One would expect that this should be a success. The reason it isn't is largely down to a terrible working of an original novel into a very weak and unfocused script. It has more holes than any Blackhole theory. It is slow and bleak yet at the same time obvious twists and strangely empty resolution. I really could not wait for the end. That's ironic because the end is largely what it's about.Whilst the set design and effects are superb the science is way off. Even the average person knows one can't survive being submerged in artic waters and then walk around with wet clothes and open face. The sling shot back to Jupiter's moon is total nonsense. As indeed is the notion that humans could colonise any of Jupiter's moons. The flaw is the script, it's a mess, all over the place.The human story is deeply depressing, compared to Interstellar which is more accurate scientifically and far more uplifting.

759,oldpaperpeddlers,Wait! It really did go somewhere,4,25 December 2020,"Cloony is a tree hugger. A save the planet guy. Which is fine. The planet needs some fixing. But I don't like it when a filmmaker sneaks his issues in on me in the guise of a sci-fi film. You sly old devil Cloony... There's a lot of things wrong with this film and that is just the start. Haven't read the book so don't know if Cloony's vision of a movie about the effects of environment on earth mirror the author's but Cloony's name is on the film. The beginning is messy. Unclear. When a viewer spends the first half of the movie trying to figure out who's who or connected in real time vs flashback, it's a major distraction and the viewer (me at least) feels like I'm running alongside a train on the move and trying to hop on it. Well-done segues between present/past should have me on the train already. Then there's the fact that all the characters have more information than the viewer and they are being very stingy with it. In order for the viewer to become immersed in the emotional sequences we have to UNDERSTAND what's happening at least on the same level as the characters! Cloony doesn't give us enough to work with. Got to drag the info out to the very end and by then it's too late. All I see are flaws and am NOT invested in the characters. It's a very dark movie with no real hope for the people of earth. But then, that's Cloony's not so subtle message isn't it? Change our ways to protect our environment or THIS is where we're gonna end up? Got it. And did he intend for two of the important pieces of the future--two of the space crew--their return to earth knowing there is no hope to be read as a sign of our human connection to the people we love (go home and die with them) or the act of selfishness it ultimately is? Two go back to earth, one dies in space whittling a skimpy crew to start with down to 2 persons to what--start a new population on the new pseudo earth they found and return to? Two people? It would have served their ultimate sense of duty best and said more about self-sacrifice if those two who returned to earth had stayed on board and been a part of the solution and future of humanity. Are we supposed to feel sorry for Cloony's character for having misspent his life? And when he could have told his adult child he was her father, he denied her that. Oh, sure, HE got something out of knowing he was in radio communication with his daughter, but honestly he didn't deserve to have that knowledge but she did. I don't sympathize with Cloony's character. Didn't like him. The ONLY thing he apparently did right in his lifetime was find the new home for humanity but he gets no pats on the back from me. And, the baddest cliche of numerous ones (like the feel good minutes with everyone singing sweet caroline seconds before disaster and death) is Cloony's character introduced as a dying man so of course in the first minutes of the film we know he's not gonna survive. Boo hoo. There seems to be the agonizing cliche where in a book or film when a man has lost is his wife or family you can bet the bank that he's gonna give plumb his resources and find the impossible solutions then just ... die. So aside from that, the visuals were nice. Rest of the characters were nice. I'm not a techie person but that seemed like a humongous space ship for just 5 people to support. And honestly, I would have liked more information about what happened on earth to put the characters where they were in the beginning. I'm sure glad I didn't pay to rent this movie. I sure won't buy it.",The Midnight Sky

782,patkoscsaba,Very disappointed by this one,2,27 December 2020,"Spoilers ahead, so stop reading if you don't want hear them.This movie was so wrong in so many ways I don't even know where to start ...Firstly, I would like to let everyone know that I understand that this movie was intended to be about emotions, connections, relations, psychological stuff, and less technical ... but man, I just can't get around the technical holes and irrational human behavior.So, here comes the stuff I didn't like and the spoilers:
1. You build a ship that can go from Earth to the other side of the solar system. Cool. But humanity is still unable to map asteroids near Earth? I mean WTF? It was just by sheer luck that the ship didn't hit a similar asteroid cloud all the way to that moon and back?
2. The is continuously accelerating while approaching Earth. Uhmm ... that's just wrong. There is no mention of any kind of slow down procedure, and the engines are all lit up throughout the whole movie. In order to approach Earth at any decent velocity, the should have been decelerating from the half way point. And it should have had shields at the back. And it should have been flying engines toward Earth.
3. The immersive 3D hologrophic display is cool. But its single use case is to be filmed and showed to us.
4. A crappy weather station from the '80 at the north pole has a better and more powerful antenna than a state of the art mission control building for the interplanetary project? Really? That is just plain stupid.
5. And talking about the crappy weather station ... none in the world puts a rack with noisy servers just near the station with a microphone. That is just never done. If that weather station had a data center, it was in a separate room. Period.
6. And ... servers and LED lights. What the hell? That huge rack looks like a Christmas tree. LED light the size of a walnut? That never existed in the past and I highly doubt it will exist in the future.
7. Back to the space ship, let's assume that they can decelerate with their engines at the back end ... they should still feel the G forces associated with the deceleration and the rotating habitat should be stationary. The floor should be side pointing toward Earth. Unless they invented artificial gravity, in which case the whole rotating habitat is totally pointless.
8. Meteorite shields are a great idea. And they seem to be very sturdy, as they mostly survived a trip around the solar system at speed much higher than the assumes current speed of the spaceship is approaching Earth. So now, suddenly, they are like egg shells, unable to stop anything.
9. And what engineer in their right mind thought to put the antenna outside of the coverage of the meteorite shield? Ahh ... I get it, they new the shield was useless from the start.
10. And this is the last one as I am tired of writing all these things. The Earth is like boiling. The atmosphere moves so fast and rises so high that it is totally absolutely impossible. At those speed the whole atmosphere would have evaporate or simply flown to space and escape orbit. And let's assume it did not, yet, but wind on the whole surface of the Earth would be so fast that no building, anywhere, north pole or not, would stand a chance. And now our hero goes on a several miles outside trip. And no I just can't enter into the details of that trip ... it would end up in another 10 items on my list.Let's just forget this film ever made and erase it from our minds.I give it two start though, because of the twist with the little girl at the end.

Also, why does the ship have rolling office chairs and IKEA shelving? Your hurtling through space a god knows how many kilometers a seconds and you can't secure things properly? The second the anti-gravity ring stops someone's getting that space helmet blown through the back of their head. And why TF did those dudes leave the ship? You family's gone, bud! By leaving your crew mates behind your decreasing their chances of survival. Just selfish. GC was good to watch, as always, and the cinematography was a treat for the eyes. This is a good movie for when your too tired to sleep and want something to enjoy a half-asleep half-awake state on the couch. Oh, and there's absolutely no rabid space monkeys in this movie, which is another good thing.",The Midnight Sky
784,tugruldonmez,A drama with sci-fi sauce,9,24 December 2020,"I was quite skeptical in my approach to this movie by looking at low ratings, however i am glad i watched it. I asked to myself, with Clooney, how bad it could be and as a person who is easily distracted or bored, it totally got my attention. I enjoy apocalypse movies in which the world is almost dead and only few people try to survive fighting against loneliness. That's maybe because I want to give up everything and escape from responsibilities , so the setting in the middle of nowhere was perfect for me. Moreover, space exploration ,discovering the unknown and travelling across the universe while doing so is something I want to be doing since I started watching Star Trek for the first time. Therefore, this movie almost had everything I wanted in a plot. On top of that the little girl that came out of nowhere and how things escalated with that in addition to an unexpected twist at the end caused me to shed some tears as a father of a 7 year old girl...
Long story short, it is not a movie full of action so it may be dull for some who enjoy fast paced movies. However, if you want to be immersed in a thought provoking story, you will love it as much as i do....One more thing, the coming home theme is quite different than what we are used to and that reverse psychology and changing of the roles were a fresh take on the genre...",The Midnight Sky

The CGI and cinematography are excellent which makes the viewing of the film pleasant and enjoyable. The music in each scene fuels the scene's emotion which also makes watching it nice. I definitely felt for the characters more when I noticed the shift in music/ambient tone. However, the story lacks clarity, closure, and chronology. We are made to believe that the events that take place in the film occur in a chronological order, which they do; however, there are specifics that beg further questions of clarity, and there's no true ending...just a peaceful signing off.In the beginning, mother is looking for her daughter, Anna, while people are being evacuated, but she can't find her. This issue is quickly resolved. Cool. Not long after, Augustine finds a young girl at the station. Anna? You don't find out until near the end of the film. It's actually his daughter(?), Iris, who isn't actually there but up in the space station as one of the main crew members, Felicity Jones. The catastrophic event is never explained it even briefly mentioned; we only get to see it at the very end of the film. There are other moments that get glossed over very quickly, probably due to ease, and need, of story progression, these events only give you more questions isntead of answers. That's the most frustrating part of the film. Other than that, it's worth a watch. It does have that very cliche, trope-y event that all other modern space films do when someone needs to leave the ship to make a repair. 😒",The Midnight Sky

Furthermore:1) If you're going to base a lengthy slam regarding ""the event"" as being some sort of ""immediate"" climate-change disaster, then maybe watch the movie again for about five seconds: it seemed pretty clear that there were something like nuclear attacks on major cities across the globe, and that radiation was unstoppably spreading outward from those points.(That's why, for instance, in the geography we are given, the birds were dying but the wolves were not. Not yet, anyway.)2) ""What happens when they get back to K-23"", ""did Sanchez and the pilot ever find their family"", etc., etc., etc. Sure, good questions...but does absolutely everything have to be spelled out or spoon-fed?How's this: in the aftermath of unimaginable, man-made cataclysm, the few remnants of humanity face the absolute, complete unknown.And we, the viewers, are invited to try to imagine what that must mean.There, that's the movie.

The twist at the end doesn't feel like the point of the story because it isn't. It's a way to show how internalized hope fear and regret culminated into passion and drive to do the right thing.

Do you know how many people die during a spacewalk in any movie with a spacewalk scene? At least one.I'll start with the positives. It looks great and the acting is great.Okay now with the negatives. There are two stories occurring at the same time. George Clooney and some little stowaway girl try to reach out to a space ship and warn them about Earth's mysterious apocalypse to tell them to turn around and go back to the moon of Jupiter they visited. There is also the story of that crew. Without getting into spoilers, Clooney's story line ends up being entirely pointless. Legitimately his actions cause no actual significant change in the actions of the space crew. That's cool.It's also incredibly predictable. Like I mentioned earlier, there's a spacewalk scene. You can predict how it goes just by knowing that one fact if you've ever seen any movie with a spacewalk, down to the timing of the ominous music.It also has some of the most funny cliches I've seen in some time. Two of the characters previously thought to be unrelated are actually... related??? No way. One of the characters was actually... in the imagination of another character??? Shocking.With the interesting concept, quality acting, and great effects, it could have made for a relatively compelling drama even with the predictable and cliche plot you've seen a thousand times before. My biggest issue is that certain choices made by the writers of this movie just make you go, ""what? why?"" As an example, some other reviewers mentioned that the actual cause of the apocalypse is not mentioned in the movie. Normally that would be fine, often things are scarier when left to the imagination. But it is obvious there is something released into the atmosphere that is making people sick, hell there are even shots of the Earth showing it covered in some weird yellow clouds. The issue with the exact cause not being mentioned is that you as the audience have no clue how severe it is. I thought it was literally world ending but some characters make decisions that lead me to believe it may be more of a ""screw with society"" issue than a ""kill everyone on earth"" issue. And it is so obvious the effort they put in to AVOID saying what caused it. It's not like they don't happen to mention it, it's that the screenplay does everything in its power to skirt around mentioning it.It's just things like that which make it harder for me at least to get invested in what the characters are doing and saying.

I fell asleep during half of this. It's like the film was written for a 1hr slot, but Netflix decided it needed to be stretched to 2. Honestly the irrelevant, slow rambling was painful.On top of that were the excruciatingly predictable ""we're on a space voyage"" tropes. Everything going well? Have an asteroid field, kablam. Calculating damage:*critical*! Comms are down! We'd better take a space walk to fix it - that always goes well. Let's take the newbie too, what could go wrong? Something! Oh no! She dead. Sad.Except nobody cared. See, I just wrote the whole damn plot in 30 seconds.Another thing I need to add - the way the space walk scene was prolonged with music was excruciating. It's the kind of thing Q Tarantino does - you know, take a mundane scene, put quirky music in it with quirky actors and quirky dancing and it strangely captivates you for a few minutes. This made me want to eat my own head to escape the screaming need to cringe. It was so obviously an attempt at lengthening the movie by 3 minutes because they were running short.Anyway, I liked the George Clooney bit.",The Midnight Sky

I don't expect much from people who don't even bother giving an extinction class event a definitive name. Not only does it not have a name, but there is also zero explanation what it is and where it came from. The only thing you see, it's spreading fast and causes death en masse. But what good will that be without some internal protagonist drama, sprinkled with unexpected moral plot twist to reinforce it. The event itself is unimportant, all right. Could have been anything, really. From a zombie horde to measles outbreak. It wouldn't matter. It's the drama that matters. And there's a lot of it. It's just it's uninvolving.At this point you know the book it was based on, was written by a woman. Not being stereotypical or something here, it's just obvious.

841,marosbts,"Lazy writers, horrible soundtrack no budget for real science",2,30 December 2020,"I have hoped Midnight sky will be a good movie. The cast was good, the trailer looked promising, but that is about where the good things end. All the rest is as story of overpromising and underdelivering. Or, perhaps even worse, it stops making sense.Clooney did a good job as an actor, showing one of his better performances. And while the other cast looks promising, their acting is subpar. The crew of a sole spaceship returning home shows little to no emotions when they find out that everyone on earth they know is dead, and the planet they hoped to return to is no longer inhabitable. The events on the ship are sometimes fully predictable. Just as Clooney is about to tell them - and us - what really happened down on earth in just 10 days, weird communication blackouts start and a meteor storm, not detected on radar hits the ship destroying the antenna. The next 20 minutes or so are just showing how the crew fixes the damage, only for another meteor storm to hit out of nowhere and killing one of the crew members. Again, the crew shows no emotions past this event.The incredible stupidity of the plot continues as two of the crewmembers decide to take the shuttle to earth despite the disaster engulfing earth and the warning from humanity´s largest scientist, not only stripping the space ship from one of shuttle landers (talk about no backup), but also leaving the long return trip to the remaining two crew members, which again, showing no emotions start entering the course back to the Jupiter moon. All of this, to the sounds of a horrible soundtrack, which is completely decoupled from the events you see on screen.It feels like they blew the budget on the relatively good visuals, but had none left to actually consult real scientists. A moon of Jupiter which is large enough to have volcanic activity but till today has avoided detection by any probe we had there. Cataclysmic event on earth and nobody except our main actor thought to send a message to the crew of the spaceship. Meteor storms out of nowhere which we do not know about, spaceships not able to fly without a beacon from earth... The list of bad science in this movie is endless.Fortunately, despite the super slow pace, the film has an end. You will not really know what happened to earth. Or to the guys which flew down, or to the crew flying back.

When listening to the baby's heartbeat, it was clearly low and similar to an adult's heartbeat...a fetal heartrate should be around 150-170...anything lower is an emergency.2. So an astronaut is actively vomiting, but it's cool to shake it off, put a helmet on, and go for a space walk...and THEN LISTEN TO MUSIC?!3. Wolves don't hunt in whiteout, blizzard conditions.4. Falling through ice is a death sentence if you don't get your head above water immediately, and exit the water.

Surely he was going to die eventually anyway from the radiation (if that's what the catastrophe is) on earth? Him being sick didn't really serve any purpose I felt, apart from to create a little bit of bonding with the little girl or drama when he loses his medicine during the journey to the other base.The crew of the Aether are likeable enough but I think there should have been more of them. Reason being is that we're expected to believe that 2 of them and their unborn child are meant to be the sole hope for the human races survival. How will that work?? Inbreeding??!

It is obvious that the film was sponsored for this intended purpose.Since climate change has become a global phenomenon, the message is quite simple. Do anything the powers at be tell you or else your planet will be falling apart like this one. Of course the film doesn't show how it fell apart, it only shows a know-it-all scientist not care about anyone or anything else because he has to send his daughter into space to save her. The little girl was cliché and we all knew who she was too. And of course someone had to die in the most miserable vain way possible.The film is boring, there is no logic to it. The technology used on the ship surely could have saved millions if not billions. There is no explanations given to answer the films most pressing questions. We see no significant footage of anything that would enhance the film or it's setting. In fact following the main character around, I'm not even sure of what was real or not, in fact maybe 80% his clips, including outside of the girl, never really happened. Its all insane to say the least.The bottom line is that everything in this film leads to vanity and depression. There is no movie here. Just an egotistical agenda.

If you want a nice, long rant, then here goes.Humanity discovers that one of Jupiter's moons is inhabitable, they name it K-23, and send out a crew there to check it out. Said crew thinks it resembles Colorado with the crisp air, and all. However, there is no sound there. If you have an atmosphere, you have a medium, so then how can it not conduct sound?One of the astronauts gets impregnated by another WHILE ON THE MISSION IN SPACE. Instead of aborting the fetus, the crew seems to unanimously agree with her continuing the pregnancy on the trip back to Earth even though this affects their mission, and possibly their lives. Also, mommy, and daddy stupidest don't seem to be worried about how the fetus would tolerate the pressures of zero gravity, space travel, etc.Clooney's character, Augustine, is a space scientist working in the Arctic region who is dying of cancer. Due to Earth having become a toxic radiation dump, people are evacuating. To where, no one knows. And when people are evacuating the place Santa calls home, you know it's bad.Literally ALL communications from Earth into space are gone 'coz of whatever new disaster Earth is now flaunting, and the crew has no clue about the status of Earth. Augustine resolves to stay behind to tell the crew not to return to Earth coz it is now uninhabitable. But of course, his antenna sucks. Also while moping about the place, he finds a kid who got left behind, who also likes to mopes around.He realizes that there is a weather station close by with a stronger antenna, packs like he is going to Target, and drives off with the kid on a snowmobile to find it. En route, a lot of stupidity ensues, and he beats hypothermia when he dives through scalding surface water into freezing Arctic waters below to unsuccessfully retrieve his snowmobile which falls in.Eventually, a terminally ill man after being scalded, frozen, and thawed, WALKS his way to an Arctic weather station for miles through blizzards, and packs of predatory wolves with no food, and only pain pills with a child in tow, and arrives there alive. His ONLY problem? Frozen beard, and eyebrows.Meanwhile, the spaceship gets hit by an asteroid, and the crew does a spacewalk to repair the radar. Mamanaut also goes out on the spacewalk while two other fully able astronauts sit in the bridge, and act as DJs.Obviously, it is another astronaut that gets hit by flying debris. And she doesn't realize she has been injured till blood dramatically starts floating around in her helmet. It is a bad enough injury that she dies in minutes. So with such a gaping hole in her side, why wouldn't she know she was hit, and why doesn't the decompression alarm on her spacesuit go off upon impact?Sigh... I mean if only they had a 'Mommy on Board' sign taped to the windows. Isn't it a downer when you are expecting a baby shower, to get thrown an asteroid shower, and then watch your colleague die?Augustine finally gets through to them, and tells them what's what. The captain decides to use a gravity-assist from Earth, and slingshot their asses back to K-23. The DJs decide to return to Earth using re-entry a pod for sentimentality.The kid is a twist I won't get into. But at the end, the two geniuses who get pregnant are the ones left on the ship. Do they make it to K-23? Do they have enough fuel? Supplies on hand? What about diapers, coz it's gonna be months before they go back, and mamanaut will pop soon, and baby poop is gonna be flying around. I mean it's fun enough changing diapers in the presence of gravity. Once they get there (if they even do), how do they plan to survive for a long period of time? The lack of sound will be the least of their problems.There's more to it in terms of relationships but with such stupidity rampant, I don't care.",The Midnight Sky
851,gryphonsatyr,Mostly Enjoyable,6,23 December 2020,"I liked it, but there were definitely some logial issues.1. Why evacuate FROM the relative safety of the Observatory, when they knew Augustine would survive everyone else by staying there?
2. Why did the computer say the ship was in range, when the observatory antenna wasn't strong enough? That would mean the ship was NOT in range of the equipment conncted to that conputer.

It wants to be deep and profound and important, and instead just lumbers along tediously, Frankenstein-patching two different movies together into one and clunkily tripping over every possible cliche in the process.It's a generic post-apocalpse story, slow and portentious, where the world meets its end via some pointlessly vague and undefined human-caused fashion, leaving alive no one but George Clooney and some weird, silent waif in a station in the Arctic tundra.But wait! It's also a space saga, featuring a super cool, designer space ship containing five generic astronaut types winging their way back to Earth from a summer vacay on an entirely mythical Utopian moon of Jupiter, bravely fighting through barrages of meteors that seem to be deliberately stalking them through the solar system!For a film that wants to be taken seriously, the science is laughable. Mortally injured people can languish in downed aircraft for days in the Arctic without freezing to death. Clooney can go swimming in frigid waters and not turn into an instant popsicle. A moon can exist so close to Jupiter that the gas planet takes up 2/3rds of the sky and yet not have its magnetosphere fry everything off the surface. In fact, said moon keeps being referred to as an ""exo-planet"" because, apparently, the screenwriter doesn't even know how to use Google.Flashbacks dragging the audience through the old trope of how geniuses - especially of the science variety - can't ever have normal lives or families. On the nose moments, like one of the astronauts actually watching a copy of On The Beach. The sacrificial space walk. The wild coincidence that's supposed to tug at the heart strings, but instead makes you roll your eyes. And then there's the ""twist"", which makes no sense given how the film is shot.The Midnight Sky has it all!On the bright side, George Clooney gives a solid performance. As does his wraithy waif. Everyone else, though, looks like they're just there to collect a check. And to top it all off, it ends with what, I guess, is meant as a ray of hope, but is actually pure nihilistic doom for anyone with an I.Q. higher than room temperature.In sum, if you're looking for a sci-fi film with depth, look elsewhere.

It was exactly what I was looking for something mysterious with a twist. I don't want to think too hard and try this out like a puzzle. If I did I wouldn't be kicking back and watching a movie on Netflix. Overall this is exactly what I was looking for in the genre.

875,BoredGirlSky,Boring but Beautiful Story!,7,5 January 2021,"This movie is beautiful. At first I didn't want to watch it but I'm glad I did! But just to warn you, this movie is really, REALLY depressing. There are fun moments too and the story is very moving but its hard to watch. I sobbed when watching the final scene. But the movie is boring at times, especially the parts where its just this old guy alone on a dead Earth. The parts on the spaceship are really cool and feel like a lot of sci-fi but with a twist. Visually, the movie is really beautiful, both the landscapes on Earth and some of the best space scenes and spaceships ever. I love the acting and some of the ideas, its also nice that the crew is more diverse but I wish that one character hadn't been killed off it just felt so random and that was a bad choice I think. But I love the story and the romance and a lot of the emotions of the characters- the actors in the movie are amazing and I love that the theme of the movie is about kids and parents. The best part of the movie is the young girl Iris who gives a amazing performance and I love the portrayal of a nonverbal girl- sort of sad that this was ruined in a twist that I did see coming, but it was a beautiful twist for both the daughter and the father anyway. And come on, George Clooney as a Depressed Dad is just too cute. So I loved those parts and I wish he could get to know his daughter more. But also I like that the movie doesn't just center around the men and that Iris is her own character after all so its better than a lot of sci-fi movies that way. I just wish it had a happier ending but its a very powerful movie and I'm still thinking about it.",The Midnight Sky

880,openminded1313,Fantastic visuals; fails as a story though,5,8 April 2021,"This movie seems to be part of a loose trilogy of George Clooney movies; with a classic thrown in as a tribute. Basically, Clooney seems to be combining the stories of Solaris and Tomorrow Land into this late-in-career end-of-world effort. The classic that I am referring to (and snippets of it are included within this movie) is the original ""On The Beach"". THAT movie (made a couple of years before Clooney was born) seems to be the iconic ""end-of-world"" movie. ""On The Beach"" looked at the lives of a group of people who had a short reprieve from the fatal after effects of a worldwide nuclear war. This one does the same; though the actual reason for the end of the world is not specified. It seems that the optimism shown at the end of Tomorrowland is misplaced and the world indeed has collapsed. As in Solaris there is an outer space aspect and that is the crew of an interplanetary ship returning to earth; they are the only humans who might survive this catastrophe if they return to the habitable Jupiter moon they had just finished exploring. They need to know, though, about the planetary wide catastrophe before they reach Earth on their return. Why they do not know about this already is a plot hole (spacecraft remain in contact with Earth during planetary missions; they do not lose contact when they leave Earth orbit and reach another planet), but George is determined to tell them anyway. Why people are evacuated from a research station in the Arctic when their evacuation site is closer to the fatal catastrophe is another plot hole. Why they would leave a terminally ill cancer patient by himself is a little hard to believe but I guess it could be done.....The visuals are fantastic; can' say the same about the story line. Clooney has stated he has made a lot of movies (he has) with some of them making a lot of money and some loosing a lot. This one belongs in the latter category.",The Midnight Sky

But for some unfathomable (to me at least) reason -- there's no plot, there's no logic behind the character's decisions and the movie reveals nothing regarding the situation at place. (while tens of minutes were literally wasted on absolutely useless, pointless b-roll type ""filler"" scenes)

901,virginiatilley,"Beautiful, thoughtful, pensive film",9,26 December 2020,"I'm surprised by negative or middling reviews of this movie. I found it a moving, intelligent film that I was glad, on a cold and quiet Christmas Day, to take at its own thoughtful pace. Those who want bang-up sci fi should go elsewhere. Directed by George Clooney with strong allusions to The Revenant and Silent Running, this is more an art film than a disaster movie, a character study rather than a space drama.The film is really a character study of isolation, challenged by a future debacle that brings it under strain. The time is 2049, three weeks after an unexplained global ""event."" The debacle is an atmospheric disaster that is poisoning all life on earth. The main character is an aged, terminally ill physicist with the Dickensian name Augustine Lofthouse, played wonderfully by a white-bearded Clooney, who stays behind at an Arctic space observatory when the rest of the staff are evacuated to some dubious sanctuary unknown. As all earth communications go silent, Lofthouse is in the psychologically dangerous situation of being completely alone. Administering himself chemotherapy (and periodically vomiting), stooped and numb, he spends his days trying urgently but without success to reach a distant space ship returning from Jupiter and tell them not to land.Through cutaways to the ship's crew, we find they are not hearing him. They are returning from exploring a newly discovered habitable moon around Jupiter (called K-23) and trying with increasing concern to reach a now-silent earth. The characterizations here pleasantly avoid that irritating plot device, too frequent in space dramas lately, of having immature, dysfunctional personalities somehow put on a long-haul spaceship by NASA. Instead, we see mature, intelligent, thoughtful people, tired of their journey but handling pretty well their years of isolation in space and now the uncertainty of earth's silence. A meteor storm, which wreaks damage to their communication equipment that they must fix alone, provides the circumstances for trouble.As Lofthouse is completely alone, strange things happening around him can seem, to him and us, like he's losing his grip on reality. But they soon crystallize as a young girl accidentally left behind in the evacuation, played beautifully by Caoilinn Springall. Mute but able to hear him, she communicates only with drawings and her eyes, lending her an otherworldly quality. When she draws one, he finds her name is Iris. We become convinced that she is really there, and it makes sense when he bundles her up and they set off on snowmobiles across the vast frozen landscape to reach a distant weather station with a stronger transmitter. (Spoilers follow.)The story then fixes on the communication problem: can he reach the weather station and warn the approaching spaceship in time for the crew to abandon plans to land and slingshot back to K-23 where they can survive? Some technical plot wobbles mar the flow here. That an earth-sized habitable moon with lovely foliage and breathable air was discovered orbiting Jupiter calls for simply a shrugging suspension of disbelief. The atmospheric poison of one ""event"" is mapped on a computer screen as expanding circles from multiple locations, which makes no sense. Wolves appear threateningly, which for Arctic wolves is a stretch. Most brow-furrowing is that Lofthouse falls through the ice and is submerged in subfreezing water for about a minute, yet somehow survives, rewrapped in a coat by Iris. In a film that mostly and refreshingly avoids trite plot ploys, the first successful communication is cut off just before the crucial sentence can be pronounced, a pointless way to prolong the communication suspense, and a space walk on the ship to repair a broken receptor leads too predictably to a death. It's as though someone told Clooney that he had to spice up the action somehow.Still, the study remains powerful, mainly in the acting. Clooney, in this craggy, bearded, aged version, is magnificent. It emerges that Lofthouse is isolated not only by circumstances but by his character. In flashback memories, he recalls standing impassively as his lover sadly leaves him. He is alone by personality and not just cataclysmic fate. That he has, with age, grown sorrowful about this eventually explains his motivation: in those younger days, his lover took with her their daughter, revealed in final scenes to be Iris, who he knows is now one of the spaceship's crew. The little girl traveling with him across the ice was indeed a hallucination, which he knew before we did. He plunged into a solo struggle across the Arctic ice to save the daughter he could never connect with before. She recalls him, too, but doesn't know he's her father. The tender ending, as their brief satellite communication fails for the last time as she is describing the beauty of the alien moon, is moving.The film is unusual also in offering a quiet acceptance that humanity will not be saved. A wrecked plane holding a mangled art collection suggests even humanity's art will not survive. Nor is K-23 the salvation. Two of the space ship's crew decide to take a one of the ship's two shuttles and rejoin family on the doomed earth. The last shots show the remaining two crew members (played convincingly by Felicity Jones and an excellent David Oyelowo), who have agreed to return to the habitable moon, quietly making the control adjustments required, but two people will not recolonize another world. This inevitability is not presented as tragic. In this sense, the film finishes as a peaceful if pensive meditation on age, death and endings, with much to say about our times.This film is highly recommended for those with the patience to go where it takes us.",The Midnight Sky
902,erinwebster,I actually liked it,8,3 January 2021,"Holy crap. Did not see the end coming!!! Why is no one talking about that? Sully was his daughter! And Iris was a figment of his imagination?! It really came full circle in an unexpected way and the message that had been a constant underlying thread throughout turned into the point of the whole movie.Definitely more drama with a little sci-fi. Yes it was slow at times but there was plenty of action in between in my opinion. As well as emotional and poignant moments and messages. Between the space storyline and the earth storyline it kind of felt like two different movies but not in a bad way. I thought all of the acting was phenomenal personally.
There were a lot of things that I would have liked more explanation on (the underground area. Any other survivors, what exactly happened to earth, where did Mitchell's family go, did he find them..:), or more backstory (iris , Sully and Ade, Augustine in general...) but I felt drawn in to the story and characters even with some of that depth lacking.

One of the things I liked the most was the cinematography, related of course to the context of the film. The big snowstorms were stunning, and the concept is interesting at its least.
The story is good, the first 2 acts, even the third act starts good.

I would highly recommend this film to everyone, but baring in mind you must watch it reminding yourself of its intentions throughout.

The second satellite/communications station was apparently built at the bottom of a valley - really?!?
The radar on the spaceship was so rubbish it didn't pick up huge chunks of ice headed for them but they still risked lives to repair it.
Clooney's character sets off on an arctic expedition with goggles (as expected) then loses/forgets about them and never wears or worries about them again!
Clooney fails - despite being about to die to even tell his daughter he is her father.
Why are people flying form a safe zone in the arctic to a deadly area where death appears guaranteed with their children? This seems agains human nature?

On the weekends, two pleasantly plump females used to come in to eat from the salad bar during the daytime, and they played ""Sweet Caroline"" over and over on the jukebox. I prefer to remember it that way.I thought the movie sucked pretty badly, and I am not sure why George Clooney made it, except to acknowledge the end of the world because it was just a bunch of lazy predictable cliches mashed together until it finally delivered on it's end of the world promise, which I suppose is something.

Great visuals and mesmerizing music that follows the story line, building drama and hope to save a soul from its sins, by saving a soul.Accolades for performances in acting that are of highest calibre by George, Felicity, David, Kyle, Demian; but most note worthy is the young bright star Caoilinn Springall, who is remarkable in her poise and serenity as an actor.I would highly recommend this brilliantly crafted film that deserves highest praise for delivering such a touching story in so little words. Be sure to ignore all the other negative reviews, as in this day & age most viewers are hopped up comic superhero action movies expecting constant fervour in every moment of the movies.This is a slow burner, requiring patience and diligence to sense & taste the flavours of its fruits of love. In same heights as 'Contact', 'The Martian' or 'Interstellar', as it requires depth and foresight to appreciate such an artwork by gifted actors, producers, writers, musicians and direction to create something worthy.Certainly one of the best space, science-fiction, dramas requiring a repeat viewing to admire the subtlety of saying so much with so little.

o Freezing cold yet they have light winter jackets and they would have frozen
o Just happening to find a downed plane with a frozen pilot yet the only survivor was not dead from cold. I still have not figured out how the guy's being killed had anything to do with anything.
o Just happening to find a ship frozen in the ice and it just happening to unfreeze and move after they got in it.
o The doc falls in the freezing water with his snowmobile and somehow happens to be able to see well enough under the dark water to find his way up and get out of the water by himself.
o Despite being totally wet and in extreme low, freezing temperatures and wind, the doc somehow does not die from hypothermia in his light-weight winter coat.
o Somehow despite the cold, wind and snow, he manages to find the satellite station and make contact with the space ship.

I've seen the other science fiction movies to which it's being compared, and strongly disagree that The Midnight Sky took elements from those stories. It's ultimately a story of survival, and that's what most science fiction movies are about. If you like your science fiction with a lot of guns, you're not going to like this movie. But if you liked the Martian and Interstellar, then you should like this movie as well. I saw one person compare it to Ad Astra which, in my opinion, was a drama about a guy with daddy issues which just happened to take place in space.

Evidently Clooney brings some of his experiences in Gravity into this film, but that is just to touch up the canvass of this beautiful little story. Does it start in the middle as some say? Well no, not really unless you want the same old disaster movie played out before you. No this film flashes back to moments where a man should have made decisions that wouldn't have led to regret in later life. It explores the truth of not being able to pursue every single goal in life and with that comes personal regret, sacrifice, but ultimately a broader but unsatisfactory triumph. This film explores that at the end of life, it is personal regret that dominates. It manages to merge them both in the end. Now some ssay this film finishes before the end. My view is that they miss the simple sentiment about what the film is about. There is enough sci-fi to satisfy the wonder in your mind. This film however uses the sci-fi as a background to a terminally ill man living alone and with regret and still having the strength to not reveal his true self in the end, due to the emotional damage it would inflict. If you missed that, you missed the film. It's not 'once upon a time' and it's not 'happy ever after'. Having said all this, there is certainly some poor writing in terms of the decision making of professional astronauts. You'll know when you watch it.

994,markjenkinsmedia,A bad and miserable film - don't waste your time,3,30 December 2020,"Science fiction has taken a kicking recently at the hands of Hollywood, and we're not talking just about the ridiculousness of ""Interstellar"" and ""Tenet"". In fact many regard ""The Midnight Sky"" as not really a sci-fi film at all, but one about human emotions.If so, the emotions are largely miserable. (SPOILERS) In short, almost everyone is dead, and during the course of the movie more people get to be dead, and more are dying. If you enjoy being miserable, you may well enjoy this aspect of the movie.Let's do our own kicking of the plot though. Everyone has time to evacuate from an arctic base as a nuclear war is impending, but no-one has time to message an approaching interplanetary spaceship. In fact it is ""out of range"", whatever that means, visiting a ""newly discovered"" satellite of Jupiter so vast that it can support an earth-like atmosphere. One has to wonder where that has been hiding all along; the details of this (or how the vast rotating spaceship landed anyone on the surface) seem unnecessary though, since standing on the surface for a few minutes would see you thoroughly cooked by radiation from Jupiter. This is conveniently ignored.On the journey back, the ship suddenly ""comes in range"" of scientist Clooney's calls, since he has easily survived a dunking in freezing arctic waters helped out by a young girl who is a figment of his imagination, and he advises them to slingshot back for a completely unplanned return to Jupiter paradise. Meanwhile due to foolishly going through ""unmapped space"" (that's the bad type, you know), they are hit by meteors which bounce merrily around like pieces of polystyrene, rather than doing what meteors really do - move very fast, and with VERY LARGE GAPS between them. In fact no SF movie has ever depicted a ""meteor storm"", or ""planetary rings"", or ""the inside of a nebula"" accurately, since all these comprise mostly empty space. Even Star Trek; Discovery has recently been guilty on this point.Some of the spaceship design and zero gravity simulation is very good. But Clooney's radio chats with the spaceship, still millions of miles out, take place with no gaps whatsoever, and the conclusion such as it is also seems completely lame, two trained astronauts choosing to die in radioactive misery on what's left of Earth rather than return to help out on Jupiter paradise.Is the book this miserable? I suspect so. Is it quite so full of unscientific lameness? I have no idea. But having seen the movie, I will not be rushing to my local bookstore to buy a copy, whether accompanied by an imaginary child or not.",The Midnight Sky

998,edpierc,No Point? What did you want?,9,31 December 2020,"So many took the time to slam this movie as having no point, when it seemed pretty obvious. It's story about different roads taken in life. The main character chose to devote his life to his work, foregoing the opportunity to make a family. The end result of his work was the continuation of humanity when Earth is (likely) no longer habitable, with the daughter he never knew as the new progenitor. The ethereal nature of the plotline as he navigated his way across the frozen wasteland was analogous to his life. He suffered great loneliness and isolation to reach his goal, and the specter of his daughter motivated him along the way. duh.Not science fiction? What? How is this not science fiction? Lasers- robots, aliens, and action are great, sure, but Sci-Fi is encompasses so much more.What point did people want? It's art. Would these critics have gushed over the great story if the space expedition had swooped down and rescued the planet and thrown a big parade? One point is about how a lonely disconnected dude chose one path over another, suffered greatly, and found redemption... how all roads lead home if one's heart remains pure. Then there's the whole humanity going off a cliff like lemmings aspect- and how our protagonist chose the hard path. Yes, it's a dark story, but at the same time greatly uplifting and meaningful. No point.. pff. What's the point of anything? Why am I writing this when I could be sleeping for work.. what's the point of work.. what am I doing? Omg life sucks. Help.",The Midnight Sky
999,Ravenborn,"Thoughtful, beautiful, the type of story Hollywood wasn't meant for.",8,26 December 2020,"I expected low ratings for this.The acting is emotional. The characters are recognizably human and rational. It's slow-paced, beautifully shot, and the ending is predictable.But it's worth watching to see a well-crafted story told with empathy and patience. If you enjoy European dramas that focus on the human experience over Hollywood spectacle, there's a lot to enjoy here. The scifi elements are very grounded and don't play into some of the metaphysical shenanigans the Interstellar or Contact get into. It's bleak, but still interesting to watch characters who refuse to give up. The cinematography is first-rate, reminiscent of The Revenant. Even the end credits show a respect for its characters dedication and competence, rather than descending into melodrama.If you're expecting high drama, escapism and tension (and I completely enjoy that type of movie too) you'll be underwhelmed, but in the end, I just enjoyed the simplicity and emotion used Clooney used to craft this sad little tale.",The Midnight Sky

It is filmed beautifully and acted very well. The movie has a rhythm which is even all the way through and no real highs and lows. There are only 2 really important factors in this movie that need real focus. The little girl and George Clooney's current location. I did have to think about for a bit after the movie ended but I think I got the message from the movie.

1005,gmrealeddiesson,"The book might be good, the movie not so much",3,25 December 2020,"I haven't read the book yet. The plot seems to be a good basis for a good novel, I don't know, I started with this movie. As a standalone piece however, this is very bland and empty. There are no characters that I can relate to.
It's funny how the sentimental approach in the series ""Away"" was ridiculed by many, here it should play a key role, or even elaborated more, by depicting the emotional relationship and journey of some of the astronauts on their way home with their families. When one of them finds out the planet is more or less gone, and he potentially knows his family is lost too, decides to go back home nevertheless. This is quite a decision, but I didn't really care, the characters were all bland.
The crew of the spaceship should have been crucial for explaining the different characters in-depth, so that we care who remains to go back to the habitable moon.
There is nothing memorable as for acting is concerned here. There was only one scene, which got me thinking a bit, when the main character decided to go to the large antenna site, far away in the Arctic, why did he take the girl with him? Which is more dangerous, leaving her on site or go on the long journey? Did he know for sure it was worth it, while he also endangered the girl's life? Anyway, the plot answered this a bit, but I only had this one scene that got me thinking.
The main character could not live to see the new world he himself discovered, but this was so badly acted that I really didn't really care either.",The Midnight Sky

1009,mcglsr2-1,"A couple hits, but mostly misses",5,22 September 2021,"Believe me when I say I get why all the reviews talk about no point. And the reviews that are the polar opposite, stating those other reviewers missed the point...I get that too. To an extent.For me, I saw the point, and I didn't like it. I get what the movie is trying to say. And I don't personally agree with the way the message was delivered.The highs: the visuals are nice, particularly in space. The space ship is an interesting take, and mostly believable. And the twist at the end is a nice touch, though the movie had to jump through some serious suspension of disbelief hoops to pull it off.To those saying the movie is about life choices, to appreciate what we have, the importance of life, all that stuff, I think you are fabricating a point where you want to see one. This movie is absolutely not about life. The opposite in fact. The human species is dead. Like that's it. Way of the dinos. Those two people at the end aren't repopulating anything. They are going to have a child, and that child will have 2 other people to talk to until their 40's, if they are lucky. And then....utterly alone. Literally the last human in the universe. Sure, Iris and Ade could have more kids, so there would be brothers and sisters. Okay, they won't be lonely until they all die. But they will all die. If they start inbreeding, it's the last of the species anyway.When you get down to it, this movie is really about a dad that was too busy to be bothered to meet his daughter when he had the chance. And that's it. So, to make up for his guilt, he hangs around to say hello to her over a radio. Everything that happens in this movie is there as a plot device to push forward that one twist at the end: the absentee parent that regrets missed opportunities. And THIS is why people say there's no point - because everything is there solely to support the twist at the end. And the twist really isn't that mind-blowing. So if you aren't blown away by the twist at the end, you certainly will not care about the requisite scenes that serve as the set-up for the twist. The flash backs, the slog through the snow, all the ""boring"" stuff is there to try to make the twist punch harder. And. That's. It.And that's where it ends. It took the ending of the human race to bring this about. A mysterious disease conveniently wipes everyone out, and in record time! Nothing anyone can do, not even survive underground. An exoplanet (which isn't even an exoplanet as it was found in our solar system, and well out of the Goldilocks zone to boot - take that, Science!) that conveniently supports life - for what purpose? Like what's the point in the story? Who cares about the planet? They might as well have been out looking at one of the moons of Jupiter, why plot this ""new"" planet that supports life? The human species proper can't get there. It won't be repopulated by us, not with just two people anyway. And the ship conveniently has enough supplies for a trip out there, a trip back to Earth, and another trip back again? Of course, it helps that 60% of the crew is killed, so I guess that's where the extra supplies come from. And the 2 guys at the end that literally kill themselves by going down to the planet? Really? To what end? Where are they going to land? They'll just crash somewhere, and die. Or even if they don't crash - like that guy will have any idea where his and kids are. So they aren't even making it to their families to die with them. You are telling me that it's okay for highly trained astronauts to just go kill themselves? And the Captain, Ade, was okay with it? They are valuable resources! What, the ship only needed 2 people to crew it in the first place? And as comfortable as it is to think about, with those guys along at least you increase the gene pool. It increases the chance of repopulation. But nope. The Captain is like ""sure thing, guys, have a safe trip down to dying for no reason."" Ugh. See? So much pretense. So many hoops to jump through, 2 hours just for the film to say ""Hey, be good to people, share your love while you can, because one day you might not be able to.""I really think this story would have worked much, much better as a short, or a novella. Certainly not a 2 hour long movie. It's not a bad premise - just not as large as they perhaps thought it was. Instead of making me feel like I go need to hug someone I love (which I think was meant to be the intention), it made me depressed. I agree with the message of the movie, I just feel there are so many better ways it could have been delivered.

He directed, produced and starred in this futuristic sci-fi which has not had the best reviews - the plot is as big a mystery as the reason why he made it. It doesn't really get going at all, the first 10 minutes and indeed the next half-hour don't really tell you much about what is going on - so it's hard to invest in the characters. He's lonely and something has happened on earth for him to be on his own, although this is only hinted at throughout the film. Some things in the movie are just so obvious you have to wonder why they even happened. I had to jump bits of the movie in the second half to get to the ending and see what happened because it was too slow to watch.

George Clooney has been involved with numerous space movies now and obviously he wants a hit with one. Like the 'benchmark' (2001) this one is understated, doesn't explain everything, and the astronauts aren't swash buckling emotional crazies. If you want to see a BAD space series, check out AWAY (with Oscar winner Hillary Swenk).The earth dying of radiation? Absolutely possible if the atmosphere is slowly decaying.A 'hidden' moon of Jupiter? Ok, definitely unlikely, but Jupiter is vast for one thing, and maybe K-23 stays on the back side as viewed from earth? Either way, lighten up critics.The spaceship running into asteroid/meteor belt?

This film does not respect your time, very little is spread very thin, if you must watch then I suggest setting the play speed to x1.5 if possible. In some senses the production quality is high but its just an empty shell, the characters are mainly interchangeable, all inoffensive android-like Guardian reader types. There is no antagonist, no disagreement, no life. The most personality in any character is one woman's smugness which I think was accidental. The average, uninventive and very 90s visual fx are much more believable then the characters - the contrast is jarring. Much of the script is trivial, irrelevant, soulless, pointless - people with little emotion exchange tedious pleasantries. Everyone speaks and thinks the same so it's too obvious that the whole dialogue has come from one writer's mind, there's no diversity, no differences, it's mind-numbing. A lot, probably most of the technology is illogical, makes no sense, it's really distracting. Between the technology/sets, acting and script almost every scene had me thinking of a list of obvious problems. The pacing is horrific - I could edit this 2 hour film down to 20mins and you'd miss nothing.

1064,dbhgray,"Excellent, Engaging Sci-Fi Drama",10,24 December 2020,"First of all, if your interest is all non-stop action and explosions, this film may not be for you--""The Midnight Sky"" is designed to be a slower, thought-provoking, emotional drama within a sci-fi structure.The basic plot idea can be grasped from the previews. It's the near future (2049). The earth is dying, due to an 'event' mostly left to the viewer's imagination, other than that Director Clooney's character, an aging astrophysicist slowly dying of cancer, hints that the 'event' is due to human fault. Maybe a nuclear war? (There is a sly reference to 1959's ""On the Beach"" in the film.) Or a global environmental catastrophe caused by societal error? While survivors are leaving Earth, Clooney stays behind to try to contact a spaceflight returning from a moon of Jupiter where astronauts have verified that life can exist, based on initial calculations made by Clooney's younger self in flashbacks from decades before (the 'young Clooney' is played by Ethan Peck, grandson of Gregory Peck--again, see ""On the Beach"" noted above.) Drama ensues as the space voyagers incur crisis on their return toward earth while 'old' Clooney (and another mysterious person) endure arctic dangers while trying to reach a transmitter powerful enough to contact the astronauts. There's a plot twist I won't reveal that adds to the mystery.If you like human drama mixed in with BOTH post-apocalyptic crisis intercut with simultaneous outer space dangers, this film is for YOU.",The Midnight Sky

The inside of the Aether looked, in places, like the inside of the TARDIS a couple of iterations ago. All that kind of lacy structural work.

Ok, wait, what?Speaking of which, the young girl who ""shows up"" at the comm station and then goes with him on the journey to locate a more powerful comm station was a poor and misleading dramatic decision on the writers' part. And she has a disability that makes no sense at all.If you stay with it to the end, you can enjoy several minutes of 2 characters sitting at a space station control panel looking painfully awkward and tapping computer screens while the credits roll. Hoo boy. Wow.I like George Clooney a lot as an actor, but maybe directing isn't his thing. Or, he's not particularly astute at selecting a script to direct.Unfortunately, The Midnight Sky is yet another mediocre sci-fi drama that could have been interesting had it contained few plot holes, characters that were developed with some depth, and if the story had more of a message that would encourage thinking about science, space, Earth, the future of humanity, and maybe even the future of George Clooney as a director.",The Midnight Sky

I've noticed that while IMDb usually does a great job setting my expectations with their rating system, there are times like this one when there is an inexplicable wave of negative reviews that gets completely out of hand.This films adds almost nothing to Clooney's oeuvre. It uses recycled themes, some of them from Clooney's previous films like Solaris, and blends them into something only somewhat fresh. But the general mood and mise-en-scene of the film is deftly crafted, which is what we would expect from the talent behind Good Night and Good Luck. This film also exhibits that classic Clooney heart - it feels like Gravity 2 but without the depth of a Cuaron. All in all I give this baby a 10 out of 10. It's entertaining and wonderful. My wife and I watched it as our two-year-old took a nap and we couldn't peel our eyes away. Rent it and put aside your expectations that this is going to be one of the best films of the year.

In the real world if something doesn't quite mesh with what I know I would say something like...""Gee Honey we're all alone on this planet, why have kids when there isn't enough genetic diversity to continue our species? I mean Dear, all our grandchildren will be stillborn or have defects so severe they will die soon after.""
Or, ""Why the hell don't you have space walk training, how the were you selected to go into deep space without that training?"".
No area in near space is unmapped.
This supposed to be in the 2040's how come there wasn't communication with the craft throughout it's mission?
Weight doesn't exist in space but inertia sure does so you still have to be strong to do things in space.Just because it is space doesn't mean a woman has the same ability as a man to move massive things around.
If I fell into water in the Arctic I would expect to die in seconds never mind be able to walk a great distance afterward.Upon coming out of the water everything would freeze including my eyelids.
There are so many scientific inaccuracies that the entire film becomes unbelievable and frustrating. The cognitive dissonances within my head gave me a headache.

An inability of a 10M wide dish to transmit or receive signals to a craft at a distance closer than Mars (when in 2020 we can still talk to Voyager probes beyond Saturn launched decades ago)... And on it goes.There are many plot contrivances that just don't add up.Now, I'm a big fan of fantasy and horror, and even more fantastical sci fi. Regardless of which genre, the key is good world building: establishing a consistent set of rules that the characters operate in, presenting situations that they must deal with as they learn and grow.However, this does none of that. It just throws random ""sciencey"" sounding situations at the characters, and the outcomes are seemingly just as random.I'm old enough to enjoy slower-moving stories like the original Alien movie. However, this is a different kind of slow - it is anticlimactic, so the slowness never goes anywhere or seems to build to anything. No revelations, twists, or surprises... just lots of serious sounding music with the occasional challenging situation thrown in.I don't know what the deal is with the Netflix script writers and producers - but they have disappointed me one too many times.Reminder to self: always check reviews here first before wasting time on movies - especially the ones from Netflix.",The Midnight Sky

I enjoyed the the Arctic scenes along with the space ones, the story worked for me - I only need a 'sniff' of what a story may be about - it isn't too hard to fill the gaps in. that is called 'imagination'.

Next in mind is Gravity, another Clooney project, only this time he's playing against a hallucination, although from the film making POV this is done well here. And finally we must acknowledge Interstellar which ends with a final nod to hope and love. When reviewing a movie I often ask myself - ""What was this movie about?"". I like Roger Ebert's rubric - ""Ask yourself how did the main character(s) change?"". I like this because it is the only question of transcendent importance.

The main theme of the story is a sense of expectation, which the movie tries to build steadily by showing the journey of the Aether spaceship and the scientist's journey across the tundra. We come to believe that a climax will occur when the two parties exchange communications. But this is underwhelmed by a sudden asteroid attack that kills a crew member, introducing a new branch to the storyline while leaving the first one open-ended. Then the sixth-sense-type-twist at the end creates more questions than it answers. Moreover, the melding of various timelines confuses the viewer who is already trying to make sense of the story.Great visuals try to compensate for the nebulous story like a flashy exterior hiding an empty interior.

Midnight Sky is a 2-hour venture into absolute boredom. You'd think in 2049, a spacecraft that travelled to Jupiter and back would have intelligent astronauts. Nope. These are more of the mopey dramatic ones who could not find their way back to Earth. You'd think Clooney had more intelligence on how to traverse from one Arctic satellite station to another, but no, he fell into every predictable catastrophic possibility there was. The movie droned on and on with a musical score that would have made you sleep, dragging your feet forever on ice til you get numb and not care anymore. It came to a point where i loudly asked, hey guys! Why aren't you arranging Iris to go to Aether??! You forgot the kid! Then, the punchline, the twist, brewing for so long, and then, the dust settles, and you ask yourself, how could I possibly care for these characters when they stole 2 hours of my life???If you still wanna watch it, keywords to the movie: Iris, Hyacinth, Aether looks like a flower, even the inside of the spacecraft looks more organic, fragility of life, losing loved ones, the Arctic desolate, no life forms, a baby on the way.

A valid question, but to understand this movie you need to put yourself in the shoes of the main character and his connection, or lack thereof, with his biological daughter.
He ran away his entire life from it and then at the end it hit him what he had missed out on his entire life. The final scene seemed a bit out of place when I watched the movie but it just serves as a statement that life is unforgiving. He leaves the conversation devastated, overwhelmed by the emotions of that first conversation with his daughter. He is ready to die. He has saved his daughter and in his mind perhaps redeemed himself of the fact that he never was there for her while growing up.
On the other side of the line, the pair continue on as if nothing happened. A fly might have been zapped instead of Clooney's character being sentenced to death down on Earth and it would made no difference.
It serves to show just how the same event can impact different people based on the circumstances they are in. How a dying parent is grateful that he made even the slightest impact on his child's life and how it goes, basically, unnoticed by that child, through no fault of her own, but based on the fact that he never was the part of her life.

Heavy (!) spoilers ahead.Just a list of inconsistencies:
* Sometime around 2030(?) humans discovers an previously undiscovered (!) moon of Jupiter of a size able to hold its own atmosphere. Apparently no astronomer was involved in writing the plot.
* There is an (completely unexplained) apocalypse going on on earth, which must kill people off so unexpected, that noone was able to set up a messsge to transmit until acknowledged via the Deep Space Network. This leads to the next point
* Communication with space craft in 2049 is apparently via analog radio (one can hear interferences). Digital, especially text communication, which can be automated, must have been lost till then.
* The space craft has extremely spacious interiors, even more than Startrek. Apparently in 2049 all problems with accelerating unecessary mass from Earth to Jupiter and back have been solved.
* When about 10 days away from earth and supposedly on a trajectory to end up in an earth orbit, the space craft is still oriented with nose towards earth, engine away from earth. It appears to stay like that (as all meteors (see below) come from the ""front"". Apparently in 2049 one no longer needs the main engine for braking.
* Due to some (again unexplained) accident the space craft has to leave its current course and go into ""unmapped"" territory. Note that that is about 5 days before they reach earth. There is nothing unmapped such near to earth.
* In this ""unmapped"" area there is not only one but two space opera quality meteor fields hanging around. The first one of it hits the space craft with complete surprise despite the craft featuring a radar (which the crew then sets out to repair).
* Despite the crew being on a two year mission to and back from Jupiter one crew member has never trained space walking in all that time. Due they no longer do training exercises on missions?
* This crew member vomits when in zero gravity while putting on the space suit. This is despite the fact that every crew member has to cross the zero gravity section of their rotating star craft (BTW missing Coriolis forces) several times a day.
* Despite the vomitting, which would be highly dangerous if happening with closed helmet, the crew member goes on the space walk.Those are the ones I remember.

1186,melchisky,"A not very intelligent sci-fi movie, despite its pretensions",3,29 December 2020,"I'm curious now about the book this was based on, curious to see if it was as bad as this movie, or whether the book was good and movie adaptation just sucked.SPOILERS AHEAD
I had a lot of problems with this movie, things that seemed to be impossible or at least highly unlikely, put in by the filmmakers to drive their plot or artificially create dramatic tension (which was mostly very predictable). First, there is some disaster affecting the human race - but they never explain exactly what it is, or how it so easily and quickly kills off pretty much the entire human race, with no attempt to save themselves. Then there is the ""newly discovered moon of Jupiter"" (exactly how has it remained undiscovered in all these centuries since Galileo?), which is ""heated from the inside out"" (not impossible, but might make it kind of unstable), and is shown to have a breathable atmosphere (really unlikely, especially if the moon was small enough to go unnoticed for so long).Anyway, there's a space mission that had been sent to explore this moon to see if humans could live there, which had left well before the catastrophe (whatever it was), and so were unaware of Earth's fate. They are returning from the moon back towards Earth, when SUDDENLY an alarm goes off - apparently, they are off course! (Really??? How? Did wind blow them off course? Did a wave hit their spaceship? Of course not, this is space, and about the only way they could be off course would be if their computer had been completely malfunctioning when they set the course, or the ship's thrusters fired at some point to push them off course. Just the first of several attempts by the filmmakers to artificially create dramatic tension).So, to get back to Earth, now that they are off course, they have to travel through this ""unmapped area"" of the solar system. I'm pretty sure, since we've been studying the solar system for centuries, and especially the last several decades, we've mapped everything significant, and the rest of the solar system is pretty much empty. But of course, they run into a cloud of asteroids (mostly seemed to be chunks of ice, interestingly, but the cloud was unusually dense, which is pretty unlikely), which damages the ship (of course, they needed more artificial dramatic tension, so this rather unlikely event happens). During the spacewalk to repair the damage, of course this unlikely event happens AGAIN, and the predictable member of the spacewalk team dies.Finally they are able to get in touch with George Clooney on Earth, and he tells them all about the catastrophe that.....oh, wait! No, he DOESN'T tell them all about it, just a few things, basically that everybody is dead and people can't live on the planet. The whole thing is basically handwaved. He helps them plot a course back to the moon of Jupiter, where, supposedly, they could start a new life. Of course, they are going there with pretty much no supplies to start a life, and only two people, since the other two members of the crew wanted to take one of the pods down to Earth to apparently die with the rest of humanity. So, one man and one woman go to this moon of Jupiter, where they will likely die without accomplishing much. Certainly it's very unlikely two people can set up a self-sustaining colony with almost nothing to work with (no animals, no Earth crops, little or no technology or medical care), and two people is not a viable gene-pool to respawn the human race (imagine the results of inbreeding when brothers and sisters have children together, since there would be no other option).So, pretty much a pointless movie....oh wait, I forgot to mention the incident of George Clooney trying to get a few hours sleep in this shelter that had presumably been sitting on a frozen lake or something for weeks at least, which decided to crack and swallow the shelter during the couple hours George Clooney is there, despite having been fine for weeks (just another attempt to artificially create dramatic tension).Anyway, I can't recommend this movie, but I am vaguely curious about the book it is based on. If I can get a hold of a copy at the library, I might check it out.",The Midnight Sky
1187,kevingj,Improbable and boring,3,26 December 2020,"The premise was interesting and could have been a good story. I generally like thoughtful SCI-FI, dystopian films and George Clooney. The visuals and cinematography were good (obviously a decent budget). Unfortunately, the script was a bit boring and improbable, the story familiar and predictable.The space side of this story was just silly. A spaceship on a long journey from A to B doesn't suddenly fly off course. In space (which is a vacuum with no friction), there's initial propulsion and then months or years of just moving at speed. Unless something hits the spaceship or it's trying some maneuver around a body, there's no chance of flying off course. The moon they visit has breathable air for humans. One crew member is hit by flying ice while on a spacewalk, but somehow doesn't know that her suit, which is pressurized, has been punctured and that she has been fatally wounded. The spacecraft is moving at 10,000 km/h and a human hit with anything at that speed (more than two times the speed of a bullet) would be pulverized. Radio communication between the spaceship and earth is instant, despite the vast distances. Even assuming some amazing future communications technology that travels something close to light speed, it would take minutes.In the end, when it's clear that earth is uninhabitable and the Saturn moon is humanity's last hope, two of 4 remaining crew members decide on a suicide mission to return to earth, taking with them one of the 2 landing vehicles and 50% of the crew. No thought or debate about how they will be dooming the remaining two (one of whom is very pregnant) to almost certain death (and our species to extinction). And the captain allows it. Right.The Arctic is shown to be in constant blizzard conditions, even while the ice is suddenly melting under their feet. The snow vehicle (which exposes its driver to the elements) can go for days without additional fuel or recharging. The main character falls in frozen water and swims around like it's a tropical pool, then somehow not only survives in his wet clothes and shoes but walks for what looks to be a couple of days in whiteout conditions without shelter.I could go on and on. Ignoring these improbabilities doesn't help the story, because the story isn't interesting enough to compensate for the assault on the viewer's intelligence. The big twist was entirely predictable as well - the person who's not really there device has been overused in recent years to the point that it's now the first thing you consider.",The Midnight Sky

1189,percyaxton,My Leisurely Swim in Arctic Temperature Water,3,21 July 2021,"I was staying at a hotel and the pool had been covered by a thick tarpaulin for 8 months. No sunlight had touched the water. The manager took the cover off, it was June, and I was the first to try it out. Cut off jeans on I jumped in. The water wasn't near freezing level like in this film... there weren't any ice bergs in it, but that's really just an academic point. Is being stabbed 100 times worse than 99 times? At first the coldness of it hit me in the head like a dentist's needle above my two front teeth...I'm being specific because that is the most painful place to have an injection. The pain was similar to a dentist's needle, only it was 1000 times worse. My head span round like the Exorcist girl. I immediately involuntarily stopped breathing and I could never properly catch my breath until I was pulled out. No matter what I tried to do, swim, move about, breath normally, I couldn't do any of it. I thought I'd get used to the cold, at least go numb and then not feel it but it doesn't work like that, it seemed as if fate wouldn't have been happy until I was floating, my blue face under the water. Whilst all this discombobulation was going on I had to stay afloat as well. I was lucky, I'd jumped into the middle of the pool, not the deep end. I could just about touch the floor and so wasn't using all my energy staying afloat. I managed to tip toe myself to the side and my concerned girlfriend pulled me up. I laid on the side, half in half out. Unable to move for ten minutes. She got very close to calling an ambulance but I started to recover and was able to stand after twenty minutes. And another thing, as the blood, which has deserted your extremities to protect your inner organs, comes flooding back the pain from that is excruciating.So, it's taken me half an hour and a dissertation to make my point that, well, that bit when Clooney goes in Arctic temperature water and comes out right as rain.........nah.",The Midnight Sky

I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the actors. All of them sold it very well. Sometimes managing to create a distinctive personage in just a few scenes.The only downside is the action. Mostly the one that happens on the ground. The one that happens in space is actually pretty ok.And it's a winner for the vfx department!

The film was started following George clooney's character and he was the most dominant character for the whole first half of the film. This meant as a viewer you were sucked in to his story and what is going to happen to him. The space mission crew became a little sub plot and therefore it was hard to feel any attachment or care for what happened to them.
This causes you to have no real satisfaction for how any part of the story goes as some of the crew are saved (who cares) and George perishes (damn)
The crew should have been more integral to the early part of the story and George's character Augustine should of had a clearer objective so you could really route for him to want to save the crew. (Like Bruce Willis in Armageddon)

I'm not one for reviewing, more of an observer but I came here to say a few things because the overwhelming bogged down negative mindset that plagues this site has struck again.
Don't believe everything you read.
It was a stimulating movie, with emotions running from loneliness to awe and wonder. The pace isn't something to ever consider, it plays more on minor interactions, the quiet place in the moments of thought and beautiful visuals.
It isn't Gravity nor is it Interstellar. They just have scenes that relate to the same concepts. But those are exact possibilities of what might happen in a scenario of off world travel...so linking the 2 is short sighted on the part of any complaint there.
It's worth a watch, even if I'd have written a little more on the earths demise concept, the time spent in space and their new home.

1216,offmylawn-57047,Too many ridiculous and unbelievable things.,3,25 December 2020,"There are a number of things so simple to address that it almost seems like an insult on our intelligence. Mankind is exploring or in some way colonizing a completely undetected Jovian moon with breathable atmosphere? The moon has wheat growing when there isn't enough sunlight at Jupiter to grow plants. Energy necessary for life in the Jovian system would have to be tidal or chemical, definitely not solar. They didn't explain well enough early on where the moon was so I assumed it was in a different star system because that's the only thing that would make sense. Mankind is able to see comets and asteroids near Jupiter. It can't find an entire moon with all of our telescopes and space probes? For the last almost hundred years scientists could tell by the movement of the Jovian moons if there was a Secret Moon hidden by a large stealth blanket. The moon would have been discoverable before space probes or before Hubble.I feel like it was lazy writing combined with an almost criminal ignorance. I could see that this movie could have been written by a flat/young Earther, man-never-landed-on-the moon type. Are there actually people who are as rich and famous as Clooney who are as ignorant of basic science as this movie is?Beyond the lack of believability, there were numerous plot holes. I guess it's possible that this story was a very old story from before man knew about galaxies or even other star systems, and Clooney found it in a time capsule from the 1800s. I was surprised that the spaceship in this story didn't stop by the moon to acquire cheese from the lunar cheese mines, because we all know the moon is made of cheese.I can appreciate slow stories, but ridiculousness ruins the seriousness of this particular drama. For those who think science and truth are satanic plots, you might not be distracted by the ridiculousness of this movie, but you still might find it's a bit slow and plagued with inadequate character development in spite of the time spent by Clooney looking sad. Even if the physics problems were fixed, the movie could have been told in a 10 minute short and still have the same or more emotional impact.If you are 20 minutes into the movie and you are wondering if you should give it a chance to get some kind of payoff for your saint-like patience, just hit pause and find something else. It's not going to get better. If you are swooning over the first twenty minutes then the next seemingly hundred years of the movie should thrill you as well.",The Midnight Sky

1221,stevo101bltd,A deep message...,9,28 December 2020,"Having seen so many of the reviews, I can only praise GC for taking on this project. Good films can often split opinion and this one certainly does. It is a deep film that is far less about sci-fi action and much more about the feeling of loss, isolation, despair at the (self) destruction of the Earth, the loss of our home. We encounter so many events and people throughout our lives, driving towards something, forever searching for purpose, and in this movie, we are made to question that purpose and our values as humans.The last part of the movie I can only describe as harrowing...there is no comfort in that isolation, no renewal of hope, no getting back what has passed us by. We have lost our home. A definite tear-jerker!I get that the film is long, and it does drag through the middle section in space, but in the end, I found that it made much more sense for it. Maybe it tells us that life is less about the big explosions and more about those calmer moments shared with loved ones - so this will put off those who go to the movies for the former and not the latter.I am still shaken by this movie. Very few films have left me contemplating the meaning of life like The Midnight Sky. Well done GC and team. Time to get the book! 9/10.",The Midnight Sky

Apart from a brief moment touching into a ""I knew that was coming"", the movie is otherwise devoid of the cliche , or worse, a human reaction which becomes so unbelievable that you loose compassion through the stupidity, like in a horror movie where you just shake your head as they go into the haunted house.I have to give a nod to the soundtrack as one of the best I have experienced..and I worked in that field myself. It sets a perfect tone in both a subtle and very powerful way, tone that only fits the scene, but helps create it.The point of the movie at first glance is not the typical button ending, but this is its beauty. Under the most horrible circumstances imaginable, each,in their own way, finds peace.Perhaps watching at a time of great personal loss, I can not overestimate the power of this ending. Life does go on. That could mean moments, days, or years, but each is where they should be.

What the hell happened throughout the movie? We know later that the Earth was polluted but where were the people evacuating to? They had to hide underground so why were they in the North Pole in the first place? The North Pole was the last safe place so why did they evacuate? The mother shouting ""Anna"" at the beginning had no purposes, but it got us tricked into thinking that she got left behind. I thought Iris was Anna until she drawn a flower to say that it's her name. And throughout the movie, Iris could have said something else other than that one line that she asked him did he loved her mother. She could have laughed more, she could have screamed, she could have done anything, but she was silent, we know for sure she wasn't mute. Yet Iris was just what Augustine imagined in his head, the real Iris is onboard Aether. But there are scenes where it wouldn't have been possible without Iris. Augustine wouldn't have stayed inside the tent that fell into the icy water if Iris didn't poke him to tell him she saw it. Not to mention when the tent was sinking, Augustine prioritized Iris by getting her out first, how was that even possible if she wasn't there? Also, that plane scene was just pointless. Why did it crashed? What happened to the pilot, as well as the guy in the cabin? What was he saying? Why did Augustine shot him instead of helping him? We have no clues... There's just too much to list out that I'm just gonna stop right here. Truly dissapointed!",The Midnight Sky

I did like the Solaris remake quite a bit though.But to this film, The Midnight Sky caught my attention right away with it's stark setting and bleak outlook but instead of survival, saving the day, etc, the film focuses on making use of the time we have left. And in forgiveness, solace, and closure.The structure of the film really makes good use of the flashbacks as well and are edited together quite well. But getting to far into that is spoiler territory. So I'll just say that the reveal works quite well.Clooney's performance in the film was also great!

It's making you think, this is going to be a Sci-Fi movie, which it isn't and probably because of it, it attracts the ""wrong"" type of audience, expecting to see aliens, starships and time-travels.This movie is a drama and George Clooney's acting is great. He was very good and showing himself as an old, sick, weak dying man with no hope. I think it was his great performance, considering how he used to play all these sexy-handsome-smart-ass roles he used to be put in.
He did a great job really and his hopeless fighting with fear in eyes is amazing.There's a lot of symbols in this movie, some scenes are unreal.... hell... even one person may be not actually who she appears to be - or even existing!
Many people take this movie too straightway.This movie is about a struggle of a single man, translated to a struggle of a mankind. It doesn't leave you with a simple answer, with solution, with closure... because this is a though of the way people are going by right now.

-Hypothermic shock does not exist in this world
-Radio-frequency communications from Earth to almost-Jupiter is near instantaneous as opposed to +-43light minutes
-The asteroid/icey debris hitting the ENTIRE Aether ship seems to travel at a baseball-esque pace as opposed to the usual 18'000 MILES PER HOUR and somehow does not rip them to shreds
-Also very ""shocking"" that a second asteroid attack pops by during the space walk. Speaking of space walks:
-A pregnancy in space would surely lead to an inevitable miscarriage due to the high latent radiation levels (and even if negligible, YOU SHOULD NOT DO A SPACEWALK WHEN PREGNANT)
-The communications tower was ridiculously easy to repair
-The shelter coincidentally sinks through a sheet of ice on the first rest there
-Let me go back two bullet points, I need to get this off my chest: Why on earth are educated astronauts having unprotected sex on a space mission! Pregnancy is such a high risk state in remote locations!
-How are wolves surviving the radiation but the birds writhing around outside Augustine's door aren't ?A less science-based observation is that I think this movie is an attempt to close the loop on similar (some great works of art, some less so) Sci-Fi space films:
-Interstellar is about daddy issues (.....Murrrph!)
-Ad astra is about daddy issues
-Guardians of the galaxy 2: Daddy issues
-The Midnight Sky is about... daughter issues!

What luck!When looking at the view of the what I assume to be the milky way, how far away from the galaxy were they? What a (daft) view.GC falls into sub zero salt water and walks away? Huh?Why is this film called Midnight Sky when the days in the Arctic follow normal day and night patterns? Is the the spring or autumn equinox? Anyway the name makes no sense.GC walks into a crashed airplane where what appears to be an infected person, but GC is fine after shooting the guy.The ship drifts off course and the whole ship starts spinning for no reason and then they need to find a new route back to earth. How long were they off course that they need to plot an entirely new route? On a trip of 900 million kilometres how is it possible to deviate so much that a new course is needed? They had to be off by tens of millions of miles. Stupid.They, after 2 years of travel they fly though a bunch of ""meteors"" at the exact same time as they get into range of earth based radio. Really? Really?After the meteor scene they are suddenly in orbit around Earth. Not much time has passed because GC is still at the broadcast station. What happened? Warp drive?When they get into radial range then there is no delay in communications. How close to Earth were they? Maybe they were using paired elections or something, subspace communications...

This is a rich, figurative contemplation that plays with form and genre.

The parallelism of the journey narratives cleverly upends our natural desire for 'destination' being the point of a journey. Both journey endpoints are nihilistic to a large extent, which forces us to look back at the connections forged on the road.I loved it: it felt more like a book, and lo and behold it is indeed based on a debut novel, ""Good Morning, Midnight"" by Lily Brooks-Dalton, which I have now bought.Expect to be made to think rather than to be thrilled.

1291,anneliesplugge,The story is worth telling but wasn't told the right way,6,18 January 2021,"While many critics are overly harsh on this movie, there are some nuances to be considered. The story Clooney wants to tell is actually quite beautiful, but it isn't being told the right way. It is only believable to those who have a very powerful imagination and are willing to gulp this piece of fiction down.There are moments in this movie that made me feel something. The moment the protagonist seems to have lost a child to a blizzard. The loneliness of the protagonist spending his last days in a completely empty building. The moment an astronaut bleeds to death. But the focus is on the empty part of the drama (watching weightless blood float around through space is only captivating for about three seconds - after that, we can move on), and not so much on the narrative around it.As a viewer who gets where the director wants to go, I so badly want to be with the narrative all the way through, but many parts of this film are simply lacklustre and perfect evidence of laziness. Case in point: the two astronauts that are heading back to their newly discovered planet apparently have no family left on Earth to worry about? And they don't even seem to be in disbelief of what is happening to their earthly home. By the same laziness, we get to hear stories of families and friends and how lovely and great they are (or were) but we don't ever get to know where they are now and what caused the events on Earth and how their lives went on in the meantime. I get that they didn't want this to be apocalyptic, but hey, then they shouldn't have added the weirdly grim airplane scene in the middle of it either.Long story short: it's an interesting story but no good writing. It reminds me of how most of my own creative story adventures begin (and end): when several scenes seem to stand out in your mind's eye, you can start to write a story around those scenes, but if you have no worthy additions to the story to fill all the gaps, all you're doing is form a long-winded, hot air-filled and eventually deflated book that no one wants to read.

1302,dollyhaze-11330,It's touching and magnificent if you don't expect sci-fi,8,30 December 2020,"So, where to start... As others already pointed out, it's a drama. Yes, it's set in a post-apocalyptic Earth and a spaceship but it doesn't matter, it could have been London 1666 teeming with Black Death.
The setting is just the background that acts as a catalyst for decision making and allows the characters to self-reflect and explore their shadows, tentatively touching on questions like fate and destiny.
Well, only Augustine really... This is a one-man show, the story of an ageing scientist whose approaching death forces him to review and re-evaluate his life and his past choices. Everyone (and everything) else is sketchy and 2 dimensional but I wouldn't consider it a mistake. This is a dying man's final struggle to find redemption and save the daughter he never knew while mankind is sentenced to death.If you expect scientific accuracy, forget it. If you expect action-packed sci-fi, forget it. If you expect a detailed plot of what's happening and why, forget it.It's a very human story and an in-depth exploration of one character against a post-apocalyptic backdrop, blurry and sketchy and more hints than facts.

Iris being imaginary was predictable, and the movie tried to be hopeful with Augustine accomplishing his mission of turning back the astronauts, but a pregnant woman and a man does not help with being hopeful about the survival of humanity.
And the two astronauts choosing to go back to Earth! Leaving two people to run a spaceship that normally requires 5 people? They risk everyones lives by leaving.

It is not a happy movie but it is a smart movie, a movie of tragedy and opportunity, a story that doesn't give you a Hollywood ending but leaves many story lines open ended for your own impression. I'm very pleased with Clooney's job here as a director and it was refreshing to watch a movie that is a lovely escape from our current global pandemic tragedy where the escape isn't feel-good, it's thought-inspiring. It should hopefully make viewers think about the state of our planet and what we can/should do about it before it's too late, and what types of people will it take to do that? I think it suggests that scientists and astronauts can only do so much...we really all have to work together to save ourselves.",The Midnight Sky

Mix of 3 narratives, intercecating at end (not impressed), no explanation whatsoever for the earth disaster (c'mon feed me some fantasy here), only 4-5 crew members at large on a mega-huge spaceship that barely seem to work but only pass time in their souvenir capsules with they're loved ones, constantly making a point for their time away from home.
A grunting beardy remorseful George C. constantly dreaming of his ex, going on a small adventure with this kid in the snowing antartica wearing very fashionable parkas (you'll get a price tag if you Google them) to find a working antenna to establish contact... God I'm bored. Also the kid doesn't talk. Obviously.
Anyway, the kid is his daughter, whom is at the same time on the spaceship (yes that's the intercecating plot twist at the end). Did I mention one member of the crew dies because of a meteor shower while on a spacewalk? I mean did anyone even try?
It's about 2 hours and I counted about 6-7 sentences in total... Typical new age 'no explanation needed it's all in the message' sci-fi movie.

Random events, like life and death, happen with or without meaning. Life is living, searching, learning and loving but also planning for the future. Nothing has meaning unless humans assign a meaning. Is not the future of humanity meaningful?
Meaning for some can be the selfish pursuit of wealth, or benevolent good by relieving suffering or more abstractly and importantly, preventing suffering for future generations. Is a little sacrifice now by the most privileged (aka lucky and rich) humans not worth the amelioration of centuries of suffering? Physically life is just a series of random events tumbling one after the other, aka chaos. This movie is about humans living and surviving among the chaos of life and making choices that are selfish, selfless or some combination. This is a compelling movie that should be heeded.spoilers
It was hinted that the chaos may be manmade but it was definitely within humanity's awareness. It may have been correctable if cooperative human effort and intervention had occurred in time. However, it has proceeded to a life terminating cascade event now beyond humanity's control and thus we have the setting of the movie.

1390,dwalkeryau,No Story Arc,5,30 December 2020,"I enjoy most of what George Clooney does, both as an actor and a director, and I went into this movie expecting a nuanced drama in a sci-fi setting, rather than an action hero space movie. And that is what it is: a drama of one man's self discovery while battling the extremes of his environment to warn off a returning mission.It could have been really good. But the story fails to fire because some of the most basic story-telling devices were not in evidence.There is no great transformation in our hero, so as a drama it fails to really interrogate the psychological state of the protagonist and move the story along in terms of his growing understanding of self. As such, as a drama, it is entirely static.We are given facile backstories of some of the crew on the ship. They were cliches. I've seen backstories like this in countless sci-fi movies, and they don't make me care about the characters any more, meaning that I don't really care what happens to them, meaning I don't care about the story, such as it is.The movie contains many action scenes that have no bearing on the story. They are just fillers. Maybe George thought that by throwing some meat to those expecting an action sci-fi story would be mollified. But even action junkies like their action connected to the story. The action has to make sense within the story arc. But because there is no story arc, each scene is a standalone vignette with no significance and little interest. And I think this is where the story writing failed. The story didn't know what it was, and this confusion is evident to the viewer.As I said at the start, I was not expecting an action hero movie, but as a nuanced drama of a man's fight against the elements and himself, it fails in some really basic areas of story telling. But I think that there is a hair's breadth between failure and success and this movie could have been great with a little more focus on the story of the protagonist's journey through the extreme events he was thrown into.",The Midnight Sky

It is slow and aimless and tested my patience throughout, right up to the tedious and pointless closing credits scene at the ship's control console. I realize one might need to suspend their view of reality while watching a film like this, but I lost count of the times I thought, how (or why) the hell does that happen? So for that, maybe there's something here. Oh, the title of this review references the Fermi Paradox, something a young Augustine was loosely challenging in his snoozer academic speech, but never did mention. I mean, if he believes he found a world suitable for supporting intelligent life, one of the longest running mysteries in creation may be shattered.

Expecting an immediate response on a radio when so far from Earth? Encountering asteroids that are travelling on the same plane and at a relatively similar speed? Artistic licence perhaps, but ultimately impossible.What sort of ruined it for me was the crew breaking out into ""Sweet Caroline"", just didn't fit with the mood of the film, was entirely unnecessary, and smacks of arrogance from the creators thinking they've made a classic - it's very forgettable but I remember that scene for all the wrong reasons.Likewise with the score, a Hans Zimmer wannabe was clearly at the helm on this but it isn't subtle at all - it's far too obvious that something negative is about to happen, or at least the writers wanted it to be considered a thrilling moment, and took away from any chance I would have to determine this for myself by what I was seeing.There are some random cut scenes and flashbacks but everything ties up at the end, some additional explanation would have been nice - like what happened to the people who left Earth?Watch it, but skip the past the ""Sweet Caroline"" scene, it's an example of film-making at its worst.",The Midnight Sky

The old, old, old, very old story.When the guy dropped into the arctic sea in the middle of the night with a windy weather and walked out alive without dying in hypothermia in a matter of few hours, I paused the movie, took 30 minute break and questioned my own being actually living in an arctic circle area if I wanted to continue this nonsense or not. I did and well, really wasn't worth it.What are these idiot astronauts? Getting pregnant while on a mission? Hearing that the Earth is dead and everyone's dead and still you take off the little shuttle and head to the Earth with your buddy to see your family? Come on, they are dead! What's the point? Not once did they handle this as ""I can't live without my family. I just want to die and be with them again"" which could have been handled just by walking out from the airlock instead of taking the precious little shuttle these new Adam and Eve need in the Jupiter's moon when they start the humanity's cycle there again or something poetic like that.Pretty much all these stars go to little Iris, whose actor was precious and did really great job.

1410,rup_74,A Fulfilling Slow Burner,8,17 January 2021,"When the original Blade Runner film was released, it was widely panned by the general audience and the critics. It did, however, render a cult following, and belated accolades from the mainstream after the Director's cut was issued a decade later. I would guess that The Midnight Sky is in a similar spot to the original Blade Runner release with a well deserved staunch group of believers. It's undoubtedly a beautiful, thought provoking movie.The Midnight Sky is set in the same year (2049) as the Blade Runner sequel. Respective Worlds are darkened, though it is a relatively recent phenomenon in the Midnight Sky. In Blade Runner the world is so alien to us from the outset that it could be tagged a pure Sci-fi film of fantasy. Midnight Sky is more a future oriented drama that presents the viewer with a more accessible present day interpretation of Earth's demise. It demonstrates the consequences of climate change and ecological destruction. The frightening imagery offers viewers vivid reminders of what could happen in our lifetimes, and uses fragments of nature (dying birds, breaking ice) to showing the fragility of our familiar, natural world.Midnight Sky has a preservation for the masses theme. Whilst the world of Blade Runner has this quest for survival prescription too, it is too far gone for collective imaginings to be sought. Its Wild West set up sees the vast majority of characters living a primordial existence - a dog eat dog landscape.
Perhaps the more fantastical side of the Midnight Sky is set in space. The quest to find alternative planets for human habitation has been commonly represented from Hollywood in recent years. Whilst Mars is the usual candidate, Midnight Sky hones in on a volcanic moon paradise orbiting Jupiter. The space crew have already succeeded in their mission, and are returning to an imploding Earth. For a group of people in the prime of their life - this is not just reward for their collective efforts for ensuring the survival of humanity.Like Blade Runner, there is one main protagonist in Midnight Sky. Both Deckard (Blade Runner) and Augustine (Midnight Sky) are in their twilight years in 2049. Both men have attained real purpose to their lives, but made sacrifices along the way to attain benefits for the greater good. Deckard spent most of his formative years living in the moment, to confront the threats of a dangerous world. Augustine, on the other hand spent his younger, healthier years speculating in his head - invariably in isolation, charting the course for scientific exploration. He thus surrendered an alternative path of living a conventional life that may have been fulfilling as a family man. The state of the Earth is mirrored through Augustine's ailing health. He is not interested in cementing his legacy, but it's of personal importance to scramble to ensure the fruits of his life's work are successfully utilised for the future of human beings. 8/10",The Midnight Sky

Moments before he and the girl are in that caravan and the girl speaks for the first time: ""did you love her"" and then we switch immediately to the caravan sinking.

We find out that the expectant mother doesn't want to know the gender, then in the very next scene she is announcing that it's a girl!The woman who died on the spacewalk.

Great science fiction is about mind expanding ideas, like the Twilight Zone. Planet of the Apes, 2001, even Transcendence, and Contact.

On top of it all, the acting on the spaceship is generally just awful.

I am not a Clooney fan normally, but I thought he did an excellent job in the role of abandoned, terminally ill scientist on Earth. The very fact the movie didnt say what exactly happened to Earth, where the humans went and so on, which is what some reviewers are annoyed by - I actually appreciated that, because we have already seen and read every possible disaster scenario and we don't need yet another. This movie instead focuses on human emotions, virtues and flaws, and ultimately on the meaning of sacrifice. For me that makes the apocalyptic aspect all the more eery and perhaps dealing with those emotions is what is difficult for some viewers in relation to this film.While there are some elements that could have been executed differently, it is preposterous to give this movie a score of 1 or 2.

About Iris, imaginary characters don't show up in the scene when main character is asleep. It is cheating! About NASA, pilot's wife is smart enough to think of leaving a message for her husband where NASA is not with all the tech in 2049. Btw, please somebody ask scifi directors to put an extra antenna/comms to the spaceships. Fixing antenna scenes are really boring. There is a lot to say about storyline too. Presenting young Augustine, his relationship and his discovery of a new planet to the viewers wasn't properly plotted. Anyways, I appreciate the effort but scifi movies have certain dos and don'ts.

1438,acb84,Expectations lead to disappointment,7,26 December 2020,"Most of the reviews I have read here, and which have rated the movie badly, start with the premise for the need of a ""point"". It is true that the movie doesn't develop all the ""big events"" happening within the story line. We never learn the ""why's"" of the base story line, this being what happens to earth, why is it destroyed. We never know what happens to Sully and Adewole on their way back to the new planet. We don't know what Sanchez and Mitchell find on their way back to earth. We don't know a lot, because the main story is not about the earth being destroyed, or the new moon K-23 being discovered suitable for human life. The main story is about a man whose personal relationships were bad to say the least. Why? We don't the whole story for that either. The character is left with some mystery onto why he made those choices, and we only get glimpses of him through very short flashbacks and the opinion of what others have of him. He seems to be respected and admired because of his scientific work, but he is a flawed man who seems to have put science above everything else.There are many storylines exposed in this movie, and none of the obvious ones will be developed beyond their need, they are left to interpretation. The only storyline which comes to fruition is the personal journey of Augustine in his last moments alive. Yes, this story goes nowhere if one chooses to see it that way, because the point of this story relies on a moment in a man's life where he made an important choice, the wrong one, one that will give a full circle to that story line in the movie.It is well said that ""expectations lead to disappointment"" and in the case of a movie like this that point falls on heavily when expecting that every story line is fully well rounded when the point of the movie relies on the subtlety of one's mistake(s) throughout life.One could go in detail into what could the movie have done to please more every person that thought it was a sci-fi movie, or the people who were expecting more of the apocalyptic reality the movie could have offered with the thought of ""people living underground, but that is only temporary"".

No. Does anyone remember ""Sunshine"" with Cillian Murphy? Was this an action movie? No.So,i tend to think that we ARE capable to watch, recognise and give the deserved credit to the greatness of a movie, even without alien spaceships,fights,selfless heroes ,epic disasters,evil robots who want to destroy the humanity for no reason.We have accepted all of those movies for what they are.Great at least,masterpieces at best.

1448,ralph-notman,Disjointed,3,26 January 2021,"This film is so slow. It took the entire film to explain that it was set in 2 time periods, and that the main character played by Cloony, was this person seen in both segments.The film started with some kind of apocalyptic disaster, but they never explain what it is, then use the disaster to affect things but don't explain how it affects things, except that they need to wear breathing masks when outside. It looks like it may be radiation, but radiation wouldn't spread uniformly in all directions like they show (they have a sequence with a computer showing red 'circles' expanding out from lots of major cities around the world), it would be carried by winds. Also radiation would affect exposed skin as well as lungs, this doesn't. If it were biological (a virus bomb or bacterial weapon) that would also be carried by the wind, not spread uniformly in all directions. It almost seems tagged on for the sake of it, without actually giving any sort of thought into it from a scientific viewpoint. If it was a nuclear attack or biological attack, why would the other researchers at the relatively safe arctic research station want to return 'home' to potentially deadly cities?Cloony is good, as an actor and his character is written well, but it just seems so disjointed with the flashbacks, I literally only realised they're flashbacks 5 minutes before the end. I suppose you can work it out, but it's just not done in a way that makes it plausible, let alone obvious.The scenes set in space seem like they should be from a completely different movie. Again, it's only 5 minutes before the end that it's explained that the reason these people are on the mission, is because of Cloony's character. Then when things keep going wrong for the ship's crew, you're left wondering *why* the writers needed to make everything go wrong for them. Why kill off a character? Why make 2 of the characters choose to essentially kill themselves by returning to Earth, leaving 2 to fend for themselves without enough provisions? Why was Sully even pregnant? Surely on such an extended mission, female astronauts would be given some kind of contraception, mainly to prevent periods, let alone pregnancy.In summary, this film had the potential to be much better than it is.

Also: When the 2 astronauts decide to return to Earth with Maya's body, did they think to leave sperm behind to help insure the most remote possibility of mankind's continuity?
There were only ""temporary"" underground quarters on Earth? How about underwater shelters?
How did Augustine survive, in the Artic, after falling through the ice?

Even though the movie could have been shorter, the slow pace dreaded by many I found to be very appropriate for the depth of the drama as well as leaving the audience imagine such a scenario, even though the cause of the catastrophic event is perhaps intelligently left a mystery. It also enhances the inherent loneliness of the human condition, and the title of the movie is well chosen. What is in the minds of the people at the end of the movie I would refrain from speculating, but the value of family is probably central.Six stars is perhaps less than this movie deserves, yet one needs to overlook some things like how can one survive the Arctic Circle after being immersed in water, and the fact that movies not far from this one have been made in recent years.

Why would someone want to contact a ship to tell them that the earth is destroyed...as they can clearly see this from a few million km? + no one is answering on Earth.

Augustine first finds a little girl who has been left behind when the rest of the station packs up and leaves. He discovers her name when he sees her drawing a flower and asks her if it is an iris and then if it is her name. She nods. Towards the end of the film, Augustine is in contact with members of a space ship returning to earth and is asked by a woman communicating with him for his name. He responds and asks her hers. When she says she is Iris, he answers that he already knew that. We see her face and then the little girl's face and they look alike. Then a flashback to young Augustine driving in a car with a blond woman and in the back seat is the young girl Iris. In another moment Augustine sees the blond woman and then realizes that he is looking at the young girl. In the final scene of the film, we see Augustine and young Iris standing in the sunset and then Augustine alone. So, I am supposing that we are to understand that the appearance of Iris in the station was entirely in his imagination, and that then the woman who communicates with him is the real Iris, perhaps the daughter he left behind when he left the blond woman.

But the plot is a black hole. I won't even bother with the unrealistic scientific issues, neither with the rest of the fallacies. (Dear writers, Bible is not reality).
We never manage to connect to the characters, either than Clooney, we don't really care what is going to happen to them. Either than a cliche philosophy on what matters in life there is no hidden message, in this post apocalyptic world. The end has come yet we have to sympathise with someone who choose a certain path in life. So what? The world has ended, and his redemption journey leads to nothing.
The pace is slow,, scenes that could be avoided and for sure missing parts you have a feeling were in the movie but were left out. Parts that could make us relate to the characters, understand them better, feel the struggles. But the director wants to prove his mastery on cinematography and big scenes.

That there isn't an unmapped part of space between here and there where asteroid fields hide. That the mission to a so called new found moon of Jupiter was flown in an extra large Space Station instead of a ship. That ice doesn't just start blowing apart for no reason in sub freezing temperatures. And that's just for starters.
Ok now, what did I just watch? A study on what would happen if the Earth's atmosphere just all of a sudden became hostile to life? So many things were never explained. What is happening to Earth's atmosphere? Where were the people evacuating to if the last of the good air was in the Artic? If it's two years voyage between Jupiter and Earth , what happened four years ago to cause this mission? And no one at NASA contacted them to say ""by the way, you can't come back or you will die""
So basically a lone survivor who chose to stay at an arctic outpost because he's dying anyway, finds a 6 yr old stowaway. So they decide to travel to another outpost with a better shot at contacting the mission, to tell them to turn back? Things that happen on the trip don't make any sense. And then the Clooney movie gets highjacked to finish off as a space movie in which 2 of the 4 survivors desert their post...and the Captain is just ok with. And then it just ends.

1519,frauenhoferstefan,An excuse of a film,1,2 January 2021,"Unfortunately this movie reeks from all the plotholes, bland and absolutely shallow characters and missing story elements.Further some scenes just make no sense, as in, why the heck are they even in this movie? The scene in which Clooney was on his way to the other weather station where he discovered a crashed plane with a severe hurt survivor in it only waiting to die: 1.) Clooney shouts at child to get lost. 2.) Clooney ends not-so-surviving survivors suffering by shooting him. Scene ends. This scene takes 5 minutes. But it feels so much longer because NOTHING except the above mentioned happens. But why was this scene in the film? It has no relevance for anything in this movie. This is a filler scene if I've ever seen one just to stretch this nonsense further.On the contrary I would have loved to learn how the earth has become uninhabitable, if or where the people have been evacuated, what was the cause? I hoped the entire time that we would get enlightend in this regard, but a middlefinger is what we got. In reality the spaceship crew has had not the slightest reaction to learning that the entire planet and every life form on it, including their families, kids and friends, is eradicated. Not a flinch of emotion. Instead one crewmember just says, staring at the sulfur-colored, dead earth: ""what are we going to do now?"" Nobody asks what has happened to everything they have ever known.
I have never ever seen such illogical behavior from actors in a scene like this.This scene is also the epitome of the dialog quality in this stinker. Each spoken sentence needs to sink like a minute or two in before another character responds, just to let another minute pass before another one can react. Also the little we get to hear is just as irrelevant as 90% of the other scene. You wont get to hear anthing interesting anway. Even more time wasted of the audience.I have written so much text on only two scenes which annoyed the hell out of me. I could go on and on, but that would not be worth it for a movie this bad.

Then he discovers that a little girl has been left behind.The scientist is aware that a manned spacecraft exploring a habitable moon of Jupiter is due to return to Earth. The scientist, played by George Clooney, decides that he needs to warn them about what is happening on Earth. Only thing is, he has to go to some distant weather station to find a transmitter powerful enough to reach the space craft which apparently travels from Jupiter to Earth in a matter of days.He and the kid jump on a snowmobile, spend several days crossing the frozen ocean ice which suddenly thaws out.

Clooney acted wonderfully and the few other actors did well enough. Special effects were really top noch. However, I just couldn't get over the main objective of the movie, the habitable moon of Jupiter the K23. It is just too far from reality for me to accept a large planet size moon orbiting Jupiter which we haven't discovered until around 2020 while Galileo discovered 4 smaller moons of Jupiter in the 16th century????? And it's perfectly habitable for humans with exact air and gravity? I understand there is much symbolism in the concept but it's too far fetched and I like my sci-fi movies to have some ""sci"" and not be all ""fi"".
SPOILER: I was hoping for some alien explanation to the natural disasters and the hiding of the K23 based off 2001 Space Odyssey / 2010 Year we make Contact where aliens tell us we can have all of solar systems but the Jupiter's moon Europa.

First of all, what happened to earth? Why is it unlivable anymore? Some sort of explanation - any explanation would do. But there was really nothing. It felt like they just can't be bothered with an explanation.
Second of all, Iris turned out to be a figment of imagination from Augustine. After the audience has bonded with her and was worried about how she will survive the global catastrophe when Augustine is gone. With the magic of CGI special effect, she disappeared of the screen, taking the audience's invested emotion as well. I felt cheated really.
Finally, the political correctness of the movie. Ades and Sully are the only 2 who will go to K23 to start their new lives and supposedly repopulate the human race.

I thought the actors were all good, especially the little girl/ Iris.The scenes looked great and well thought out. I felt like a number of scenes could very easily have been used as stills/ for movie posters, etc.Most of the dialogue was not overly dramatic or sensationalized and were fitting for the subdued feel of the movie. Personally I'm not a fan of one-liners delivered by cheesy actors as they look away or before the scene changes, so I appreciated this a lot.The one thing I didn't like so much:
The pace. I felt like some scenes were slower and/ or longer than I would've preferred. I ended up using the ""skip ahead"" and the 1.5x playback option *a lot.*I also found myself thinking ""Augh... get this over with already"" on a number of scenes, which was kind of sad because I thought the story was quite all right; it's just some of the scenes dragged on quite a bit. I ended up comparing this to The Martian, which I liked immensely. That one, despite the plenty ""give this guy a break already!"" scenes, did not feel a third as bleak as this one.Overall I just feel like it could've been made a bit less dragging. That it wasn't and turned out awfully bleak is really unfortunate since I really wanted to like this movie so much.",The Midnight Sky

As if the basic storyline didn't have enough intrigue, you will constantly find the movies characters facing a compilation of sci-fi's most exhausted hardships.

So, you wait to see how things move on and theres a little hope, something interesting might happen (finally) and then BAM, nothing... like you see a wolf of some sort, then some sinking container and some scenes in space and all of it you've seen already somewhere before.
Not even to mention a terrible acting, if there was acting at all. The only nice part of this movie are some animations of another world somewhere...
i could'nt wait for it to end to turn if of finally after all hopes were lost with this flick and watch something that had some kind story, sense and flow.

1597,robyyytza,Un film exceptional,10,26 December 2020,"Augustine Lofthouse is an ambitious scientist who works towards finding habitable planets where humanity could expand. One night after giving a presentation at a gala, he meets Jean Sullivan and the two begin a romantic relationship. Jean soon leaves him after a pregnancy scare due to his obsession with work and inability to form bonds with other human beings. Several years later, Augustine encounters Jean again by chance and discovers that they have a daughter, but chooses not to introduce himself.Thirty years later, in 2049, a cataclysmic event wipes out most of the Earth, killing almost all of the population with powerful radiation. Two weeks later, Augustine, now working in the Arctic, refuses to evacuate his base, knowing he hasn't got long to live due to his serious illness requiring dialysis. Alone, he tries to contact any space mission hoping to warn them about the situation on Earth but finds that all but one have been decommissioned. Only one mission, the space craft Eather, is still active and currently returning from Jupiter after having explored a habitable moon, K-23, which had first been discovered by Augustine. On board, the crew is unaware of the events on Earth. Augustine attempts to contact them, but the antenna is too weak for his signal to reach the ship.One night while working, Augustine finds a young girl in the station who doesn't speak. He tries to contact his previous colleagues but quickly understands they are all gone. Thanks to her drawing, he understands that her name is Iris. Reticent at first, Augustine grows fond of Iris and the two set off for another base in the Arctic hoping the antenna will be powerful enough to contact Aether. The pair face the freezing temperatures of the North Pole and a series of obstacles that cause Augustine to lose his dialysis equipment, thus condemning him to die soon. Arriving at the base, he manages to contact Aether, briefly warning them about the situation, but the crew is interrupted by a meteor strike that damages the radar and communication systems on board.To fix the ship, pregnant astronaut Sully and her partner, Commander Adewole, conduct a spacewalk with their flight engineer Maya. The team manages to fix the comms and radar but are caught in the middle of a second meteor strike that fatally injures Maya who, despite Sanchez's best efforts back on the ship, dies moments later. A broken Sully reaches out to Augustine who tells her not to come back to Earth but to instead go back to K-23 and start a new life there.Aether's pilot, Tom Mitchell, refuses, but upon discovering his wife's final words and seeing the scorched surface of the Earth, understands it is in the crew's best interests to go back to Jupiter's moon. However, he decides to use one of the space shuttles to go back to Earth hoping to find his family. Sanchez, who saw Maya as a second daughter, decides to accompany him and bury her body. The two set off back to Earth.In her final communication, Sully speaks of the fact that Augustine was one of the reasons why she joined NASA. She thanks him, telling him her mother Jean knew him and that her full name is Iris Sullivan. Augustine realizes or confirms that Sully is in fact the daughter he had with Jean thirty years prior, and that the young Iris is merely a hallucination, an image his mind created to motivate him. Before succumbing to his illness and the radiation, Augustine tells Sully he's proud to have finally met her and Sully describes K-23 to him. Sully and Adewole, now the only survivors, set a course for K-23 where they hope to give humanity a second start.",The Midnight Sky

Two hours that I'll never get back!",The Midnight Sky
1615,Brendissimo35,An immensely frustrating film,5,22 January 2021,"First, the positive. This film features a number of very good performances by the cast, especially Clooney. They manage to convey the sense of desolation, fear, determination, etc. that one might feel when faced with the literal end of the world. In addition, the cinematography is quite good - it features many striking and even haunting images (the last man on Earth watching sunrise over the Arctic, fields of gold on a moon of Jupiter, a crashed private business jet in a field of ice, filled to the brim with hoarded art and treasure, etc.). There are a great many moments and concepts in this film that are quite moving and thought provoking.However, much of the film's impact is undone by its inconsistent tone. I don't know quite how to describe it, but this film feels simultaneously grim and saccharine. I think a lot of it is due to the score, which is omnipresent, often in ways that undermines what would otherwise be beautiful scenes. It feels like the composer wanted the audience to hear the individual instruments of the orchestra in every single moment of every scene. Yet the score also feels very forgettable and generic, with few memorable themes or melodies. Someone with more of a music background could probably describe it better, but suffice it to say that by the second half of the film I was audibly cursing the score out of frustration - it was interfering with my experience of the film that much.In addition, many events in the film defy logic in ways that are increasingly difficult to overlook (minor SPOILERS AHEAD). I won't go to the trouble of listing all the science and logic mistakes in the film, as others have done that already. The most egregious example is a scene in which Clooney's character falls through the Arctic sea ice into the water. He's down there for at least 30 seconds before climbing back out, absolutely drenched, putting on a coat, and continuing a journey of (presumably many) miles on foot, through blizzard conditions, to the weather station. I am no expert but from everything I understand about temperatures near the poles, he would be dead in a matter of minutes after falling into the water, and definitely would be in no condition to make any kind of journey without warming up and changing clothes (also, who puts semi-permanent shelters on top of sea ice?). There are many other frustrating moments in this film which defy science, logic, and common sense. I had the increasing sense that the film was racing to cross off a checklist of tragedies in its second half, consequences to the film's quality be damned.What is so frustrating about this film is that it is not outright terrible. I am open to a slow-paced, meditative take on the apocalypse. I am open to films with no possibility of a happy ending. I think comments saying there is ""no point"" to the film are a bit misguided (does a film have to end in a character achieving something spectacular for it to be worth your while? I hope not.) With a different score and some more editing it might be a solid 7/10 film (albeit with numerous science mistakes). But as it is, The Midnight Sky is VERY frustrating to watch.",The Midnight Sky

The special effects are excellent (no wonder it's nominated for an Oscar on that) but I think as astra did a better job a telling a human introspective story in space.

1637,aarontwhitehead-29723,"Please remove Sci, from the description",1,27 December 2020,"I really was hoping for a good sci-if movie. However what I received was a frustrating hodge podge of scenes written by what appears to be a 12 year old that never really paid attention in science class. The errors were infuriating to me. Here are some that I can remember. I was so frustrated by the end, that it all became a blur.
In an early scene, everyone is evacuating the station which apparently is one of the last safe places on earth. So they were going where? Later it was said that they were under ground. This makes no sense to me either.
So, a sick elderly man that is apparently dying of some undisclosed disease, kidney failure maybe since it looks like he uses a dialysis machine, decides to trek across the ice to a bigger antennae. Along the way he decides to stop and rest in some type of weird camper box. The camper box then sinks into the freezing water and he gets very wet trying to escape. Even though he is in failing health and he is wet in subzero temps, he can still trek for a couple of days and survive both the elements and the wolves.
Then you have the space ship. The visuals are stunning, but the science is missing. Apparently there is an inhabitable moon in our solar system that we completely missed. It's pretty nice too. It already has wheat fields growing on it. Well. This ship is returning home from this moon when lots of terrible scenes happen such as a space walk with a 2 year seasoned astronaut that cannot stomach zero gravity. Really? I wonder how she graduated the academy? Then while they are on their space walk, there is a huge asteroid disaster that pounds but barely scratches the surface of the ship. It must be built like a tank. Well unfortunately one of the asteroids hits one of the astronauts and punctures her suit and back. They rush her into the ship to do exactly nothing to her except stare at the blood as her life fades away. I would have thought they would have exposed the wound, applied pressure and attempted to resuscitate her. I guess they forgot to bring along a doctor. These guys are obviously idiots as witnessed by them singing and playing loud music while not paying attention in the middle of a mission critical repair to the radar, I literally screamed ""you guys need to focus!"" Then when they finally figure out that the earth died completely in the 2 years they were gone, rather than shifting their focus on the survival of the human race, half of the crew (including the pilot), abandons ship to leave the existing crew to die. By doing this, they considerably decreased the odds of survival on the return trip, and they diluted the gene pool by half. But the gene pool apparently wasn't very deep with these guys anyway.
If the movies intent was to spark emotion, then it succeeded with me, unfortunately the emotion was that of extreme disappointment.

1652,leehossain,Zzzzzzzz,2,23 December 2020,One hellva boring film. Sorry Mr Clooney you were very self indulgent. I was bored and kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Alas nothing happened. Just a series of bland and uneventful scenes with some really dull characters. This film is like a number so called 'sci-fi' movies that just lack any real drama or meaning and just end up navel gazing. It reminded me of another time wasting one called Ad Astra starring Brad Pit. What has happened to sci-fi these days. The 70s 80s and even 90s were so good :-(,The Midnight Sky

The things that were not predictable (and that kept us awake) were left unresolved.
The visual effects lack accuracy and realism (a modern-day 3D game beats this film easily in many, many scenes).
The physics lack accuracy (I ""felt"" the zero-gravity motion particularly sloppy).
The medical issues/problems/challenges that arise throughout the film are outrageously unrealistic.
Scientific accuracy is poor (i.e. Immediate no-lag calls to a spaceship that should be at least a few light-seconds away).Did I mention that the plot is slow?

He encounters an unexpected intruder in the form of a lost girl; the girl barely says 3 sentences & is built around stereotypes of what makes a girl pleasant. Boring. Then we have the scientist's life plot; again, built around the stereotype that hard working genius scientists are narcissistic workaholics who neglect their families. Then we get to the 2 minority supporting characters injected into the story seemingly to meet a quota; it's clear right away that one of them will have to die; unsurprisingly, it's the girl who has no emotional connection to the main characters. There's also a pregnant lady taking in a ton of radiation in outer space but no one seems concerned. I still can't tell what was worse:

1682,aprilrobillos,"Ultimately, this is a story about family and how this is the one thing that will most likely sustain us at the end of days",9,25 December 2020,"All the people who gave this film a low rating, I think, missed the point. This is an adventure film, disguised as a thoughtful affirmation that even in the face of disaster, it is the people we love who sustain us, and for whom we would make the ultimate sacrifice. Every single character in this film had family ties. Sully and Adewole who never let being in the family way prevent them from living their dream of exploring the stars (in contrast to Augustine who did not even meet or make himself known to his daughter so focused was he in his scientific work). Maya who, even in her quiet time of reading, surrounds herself with the images and sounds of her family (by blood and by heart). Contrast Augustine who seems to have cut himself off from all human relationships. Sanchez who lost a daughter and who imagined Maya and his deceased daughter growing up together as friends. He could have stayed in the ship. Yet, even he returned to earth ""to bring Maya home."" Mitchell who seems to eat breakfast ""with his family during the entire two years of the mission, and for whom he willingly risked his life in the small chance they could be reunited. Contrast Augustine who was initially unwilling to take responsibility for a child and whose first action was to attempt to pass off the child to whoever is out there. When he said ""I'm not the right person,"" it's not just because he is ill and dying. He's not the right person because he has never been responsible for anybody.Looking back, we now realize that Augustine's change of heart appears to have happened after he saw the ship's manifest and recognized Sully as the daughter he never knew, and one he could potentially save. The child Iris is the image in his mind of the child as he last saw her and what kept him going to reach the weather station despite the hardship. Knowing what we know of Augustine, he probably would not have given a damn about this lone spaceship who will be returning to earth to certain death. It's not in his character to care or be heroic. He could have stayed at Barbeau and been content to wait out his final days there. But he didn't. In the end, it's his one last link to humanity, his daughter, that prompted him to act selflessly, probably for once in his life.I loved the film and its message. All the actors gave terrific performances. The visual effects are stunning. But one has to see this film as more than just a simple adventure film, of one man's race against time. It is so much more than that.",The Midnight Sky

1686,timkisley,Stop looking for a space adventure.,9,25 December 2020,"I'll cut to the chase--this is a film about isolation that comes from choices we make. I'm guessing those who criticize the movie would also slam Moby Dick for not being more about the whale. Not saying that Clooney has created Citizen Kane, but this is a better film than most are stating in this forum.
And I have to admit that stories about being alone at the end of the world are inherently negative. These are morality tales in which our intelligence becomes our undoing. Certainly, we are capable of making good choices that ensure biological and ecological sustainability, but we also make short-sighted choices that put these necessary systems at risk. Not the least impactful of our decisions is the continued insistence on maintaining nuclear weapons.
Whether or not you agree this is the backdrop of Midnight Sky, the film makes reference to an ""event"" which created a turning point and accelerated the destruction of all life on earth. The film's characters face an end-of -the-world scenario, and Clooney's Augustine, who has chosen isolation most of his life in support of his professional pursuits, now chooses to be alone again. The writers' introduction of the little girl, Iris, into Augustine's final days implies that he has finally come to a sense of loss and, I want to think, regret, because like most mammals on earth, human beings are social beings. We get along better individually when we get along with each other. We accomplish more when we collaborate. Our strength is in numbers.
Which makes the decisions onboard the spaceship more interesting than any Augustine makes. Rather than stay together and attempt the only viable choice to start again on another planet, crewmembers decide to abandon ship, virtually choosing certain death. And while a viewer might look optimistically at the future of humanity who choose to remain on a space craft headed for the new world, the writers' have them leave the ship's bridge separately, in different directions, isolating one from the other.
This movie would have died at the theater box office. Nevertheless, it's a deep look at who we are, something I could appreciate. For those who criticize its science, human psychology has always upended science. We tend to believe what makes us feel good.",The Midnight Sky

Also there are a couple members of the crew that don't get along, and you can imagine discontent on a long space journey builds some tension, but I think they wrote one of the characters out entirely.

I almost didn't watch this movie with all the bad reviews. I feel compelled to leave a review as the negative reviews all seem to have common themes. The main topics of discussion I see of why people think the movie sucked are the lack of action/lack of plot and bad science. I hope the following can provide clarification:Plot justification:
Imagine yourself in a situation where Earth's atmosphere becomes poisonous and Earth subsequently uninhabitable. The human race is struggling to find out what is happening.There isn't time. It progressed faster than anyone imagined. This is life now. No answers, no explanations, no time. But what happens when all the sudden you are left in this inedible situation but now stranded by yourself? Time, that of which was so quick to flee as the world tried to save itself, is now all you have left. What will you make of it?Science:
I am a Master's student in Physics. The situation given in the movie is that a new habitable moon of Jupiter was discovered. Whatever. Assuming the existence of such a nearby utopia, the methodology used in the movie is surprisingly accurate. A few liberties are taken but never in a way that detracts from the overall logical progression of the movie.The point of this movie is not to tell a story but rather to convey a passion. That of which you need to watch the movie to make for yourself. The message I received, concisely, is that hope can be found when none has a right to exist, and I hope you are able to enjoy the movie as much as I did.",The Midnight Sky

George Clooney knows a good book & film in my opinion and has done a fabulous job in bringing this to the big screen.
In 2021 when the world is suffering a mini catastrophe of its own, we are reminded in this film of the beauty of the planet we all inhabit and just how we need to treat this with care for generations to come.
Ignore others who may have expected something meaningless and watch this for a suprb message, beautiful scenes, fantastic acting and be grateful that we have the likes of GC willing to take a risk and bring us a film which at times is so moving and beautiiful.

1782,bloodydonuts-06894,Reliving a life of regret and creating a new legacy.,8,1 January 2021,"This movie touched me and moved me, and with this review I hope to share my appreciationof its qualities. It firmly falls in the category of ""heady sci fi."" You know, the type that requires a second watch to fully understand. The reviewers who didn't get it were apparently not paying attention, and/or have a very short attention span. Please pardon me for needing to explain some things to those who do not understand the plot, but maybe it will help sway a few of the naysayers to give it another chance. Spoilers abound from here on out...Sure, there were definite moments that don't follow strict scientific principles, like falling into frigid arctic water and surviving, but you have to remember the word fiction is a main part of the genre's title.Others complain that there was no purpose to the story. Let me give you a little rundown about some of the themes occurring throughout the movie: family, love, regret, ambition, legacy, fear of death, redemption.The story telling was meticulously executed. It was not necessary to explain how or why life on Earth was extinguished. My guess is nuclear war, but I could be wrong. It doesn't really matter, because that was not what this story was about. This film was about a dying, crumbling man who was reliving his life's greatest regret: walking away from a child that he never wanted because his ambition got in the way. He sacrificed everything for his legacy. A legacy that had no future once mankind was extinguished, which he painfully understood the folly of it in his last days.The viewer may not initially realize that the lone survivor on the planet, Augustine, was reliving his life step by step through his hallucinations of his own 8 year old daughter, Iris. It may not be obvious upon first watch that he knows that she was his girl from long ago, but once you realize that the reason he wanted to communicate with the Aether is so he could speak to his grown-up daughter for the first and last time. Yes, he knew it was her. This relationship is only revealed in the final heartbreaking scene, and quite emotional it is!In the end, he got his chance to help humanity, and more importantly, connect with his daughter to create a whole new legacy that was far greater than what he thought he wanted in his youth.Here is another little secret: the birds were real, but the wolves were also his hallucination. So was the plane and the survivor he shot. You guessed it, all a metaphor...Now, as far as the group on the Aether. They represented the best ideals of humanity. Courage, camaraderie, love for fellow man, strong family values, altruism, faith. Whether we agree with their choices in the end, it doesn't matter. Everyone has their own motivations and must follow their own path. If I may borrow from another current sci fi property: ""This is the way."" We don't have to understand their motivation, just accept and support it. Being able to reconcilie their own decisions is admirable, despite suffering the consequences. It just took Augustine longer to get there.Oh, and the soundtrack was outstanding. I immediately downloaded it on Spotify after finishing the movie.This is a movie that I will revisit at least a few more times in the future when I need to recalibrate my priorities and restore my faith in humanity again.",The Midnight Sky

1800,rrabagast,I kind of liked it,6,5 January 2021,"So I reckon Augustine must have died when he fell in the water. Without a dry set of clothes he would very quickly have died of hypothermia in those conditions so everything from that point must have been his near death hallucinations. It annoyed me at first how he went on after that, but it would make sense if everything after that point was hallucination.Similarly, it annoyed me at first that a small child would be running around an Arctic base in a dress and bare legs - that is no way to dress children in that kind of climate! But there is a good reason why she is so inappropriately dressed.
Regarding some questions raised in other reviews:But we never got to see what happened to the astronauts who returned to Earth, did Mitchell ever find his family?
It was made quite clear that there was no way they could survive after reentry.But why didn't the wolves die like the birds?
The wolves were in a less contaminated location than the birds. Augustine was monitoring radiation levels and by the time he reached the wolf location he'd removed his mask because the air was ok to breathe there.But a global climate disaster wouldn't happen that quickly!
There was no indication that the unexplained disaster had anything to do with climate change. Plenty of clues showed the disaster was nuclear.But what about the future of human race, inbreeding, etc?
The human race is over. Best case scenario would be Iris and Ade landing safely on K-23 and eventually dying of old age, maybe with a few more kids.
Anyway, it's a visually beautiful movie that you might enjoy if you're into slow, sad, meditative stories in (post) apocalyptic settings. It held my attention throughout, which is my main metric for rating movie quality - if it manages to hold my attention it's above average in my book. Yes, that's highly subjective but this is my review.It's not a Sci-Fi adventure and you'll be disappointed if that's what you expect.

The loneliness in the opening scene let's us know that this certainly won't be an action sci-fi. Rather, it's an introspective drama set on earth and in space in the year 2049. I was most attracted to was the theme of communication throughout the movie. We have Clooney and the space team literally trying to communicate with each other and other travelers, but more importantly, the failed communication Clooney's character had with his lover and daughter. This is shown beautifully in the expressive acting done by the little girl. She receives only one line and it's really all we need.

The details of how the characters got where they are and what is going to happen next aren't really as relevent as what they are doing in the moment or how they face death.My only actual complaint is that every recent movie or tv show about space travel has someone making a space walk to do repairs and of course something goes wrong. Maybe the space walk is in the book the movie is based on, but seeing that it's really not a science fiction film I'm not sure why they invested so much into that scene or wouldn't have switched the story out a little.At the end of the movie you learn the motivation behind what Augastine has been doing throughout and his individual story does have a conclusion.Give it a chance.",The Midnight Sky

1820,egordkuzin,It's a metaphor,8,5 February 2021,"It's funny how people try to interpret the symbolism of this metaphorical movie scientifically. Ofcourse it does not make any sense for a fancy spaceship to have such poor connection, nor does it make much sense to keep a crowded Arctic base and then all of a sudden for all the people to depart simultaneously.It's a movie about an old man who just retired and is feeling lost and alienated: there's no family, no friends, and now even no colleagues. He's all alone and feeling cold and dull, as if he's alone in the ice desert - that's how it feels for him.This man is flashbacking to the point in his life when it all did go wrong: the moment when he parted with his daughter. He never really bounded with her, he doesn't know her, and that's why her ghost is silent - he has no idea what she possibly could say to him, just that she possibly could have been seeking his company.And then there is this cool fancy spaceship of his grown-up daughters current life (as he's imagining it). And he would risk his life to hear her voice - and tell to never come back to the cold ice desert of his life, to change the course, never end up like him.I believe it all could have been more obvious if the acting was even more grotesque, like when they pull dead serious faces trying to do the serious mathematical calculations on those futuristic computers. Like it's so unrealistic we must get an idea it's all only a metaphor in the head of an old and lonely George Clooney.This movie has low ratings because many viewers were lured to watch a sci-fi movie and got all metaphorical family drama instead.",The Midnight Sky

Scientific inaccuracies, which are usually excusable if one can suspend their disbelief (like we all did with Star Wars etc), are abound. Read the other reviews if you want lists of them. I found it very difficult to look past them. A meandering plot, which would normally be ok if it ended up at a solid finale (but sadly this one didn't), left me bewildered half way through the film and I was not satisfied when it ended.
BUT!!!!!! I would like to point out some good in the film, and here it is. There were a couple of amazing performances: Mr Clooney, as usual, but the little girl was brilliant, and brilliant with very few lines with which to shine.

The movie however leaves a lot of questions unanswered. People say nothing is happening in this movie. Well, i think smth does happen. That great coincidence, the moment between we are all wiped away and Adam and Eve can go back to the new planet and restart human race. This is actually what is captured in the movie.

Its not a bad film its just choppy, the connection to the backstory is a miss and I watched it over because i thought i had missed something... sadly no...This movie adds nothing to the Scifi genre and is at its best a story of bad life decisions of the characters which doesnt hold up.

1859,marchetti50,"""The Midnight Sky"" - Such constant sorrow.",3,30 January 2021,"I wanted to put a movie on while my family and I were eating Christmas Eve dinner. Unfortunately, I chose ""the midnight sky"".About half way through the movie I had the physical reaction of jerking my torso forward repeatedly and my family thought I was choking on my dinner. I was actually trying hard to get a character to finish her sparse and drawn out dialog. So, we decided to turn it off and probably never watch it again. I shifted to searching the internet for people who felt similar to me since that was the only way I was likely to get any enjoyment from the movie. And it worked!Thank you IMDB.During the movie I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.
After a while I started hoping that maybe an alien would pop out of Clooney's beard - like Quatto from ""Total Recall"". Or, maybe something deeply symbolic was about to happen with the peas - kind of like Roy Neary's mashed potatoes in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".I've always heard that it's hard to get the green-light for a movie so I'm not sure who thought that George Clooney, slowly eating a bowl of porridge for 52 minutes, would make a good movie.Even my 13 year old son started calling it ""The Midnight Sigh"".From the little that I did watch, I thought Clooney's acting was very good and I did like the green pea scene with the little girl.I was also impressed with George's beard which would have been well cast in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" I Love him in that. Maybe ""The Soggy Bottom Boys in Space"" would have been a better idea.After seeing Mr. Clooney in this movie and in Gravity, I think it might be wise to permanently ban him from outer space.",The Midnight Sky
1860,rolandrak,loved it,9,2 February 2021,"There are journeys : one through space, one on the North pole ice cap ; they are well filmed... Another is an inner voyage in remembering a life which was spoiled and wasted through lack of courage in front of one's responsibilities and in dealing with one's sentimental deficiencies... So the film is about personal redemption. The catastrophe that hit the Earth is, as a matter of fact an image of Augustine's last days : there's only one hope left : save the astronauts, and get them en-route to - maybe - a last chance at saving mankind.
This film is not for the ones looking for a thriller full of action. It's slow and spends a lot of time getting more substance and thickness to our characters through unexceptional scenes (they look more human in everyday's lives...)

It's unfair to compare it to other space films as it's, oddly, not about space. Space provides just one element of the setting in which the story takes place and provides a meaningful backdrop in a tale about life, priorities and regret, all the while there is the Macguffin that is whatever we did to Earth.

Very unfulfilling and could at least have been written from the point of view of despair.Ultimately, I wasn't sure what the story was about. It's not about a brave man who saves humanity, because the two that make it to K23 will just die. It's not about a man reuniting with his daughter because he never tells her.

The movie does have a slight identity crisis in that its part ""The road"", part ""The Martian"" however the two storylines do come into a sweet conclusion in the end. It also has a genuine emotional twist ending, which didnt feel forced like so many of the ""twist"" endings in recent times.

However, good vs bad is just a mather of opinion.
If you have seen a lot of movies, I do understand, this movie looks ""more of the same"". Maybe because this movie is more a kind of ""limping on two legs"", due to the fact that it is a drama (the realtion between a father and his daughter) and added some almost unnecessary predictable (SciFi) action (where everything that could go wrong, goes wrong).

It's unsure.The appearance of the little girl makes for an interesting take, but at least it's further explained at the end of the movie.Overall, there's more that can be said throughout this film, but I find it's production very well done and still nice to see the work put in.",The Midnight Sky

How did they get no recorded message from earth saying not to come back/that there was a catastrophe.And the part that bothers me the most, that I haven't seen anyone else point out and the reason I'm bothering to leave a review on this mess, how does humanity live on? We never find out what happened to the colony ship that was supposed to take off. We never find out if there are other people on k-23. So humanity ends with the astronauts' baby?

The high number of bad reviews I can only explain with the fact that Netflix has raised all the wrong expectations. It is not a simple catastrophe film, nor is it a simple action film, but a profound story about regrets. Hopefully Netflix will deliver more movies like this! I had almost lost hope. For me, this movie was also an ""aha moment"" because I understood why Netflix removed IMDb ratings. Often it's better if you don't even know what ""others"" think beforehand.

It's not ""Die hard"", so of course you will not find sequences of fast past action. It's a slow Sci-Fi movie. The story is not complex at all, but that's ok, it is sufficiently interesting to task yourself what you would do in the same situation. The visuals are great, and I particularly enjoyed the love of details when they created the ""Aether"" space ship.Yes, there could have been more character development, there was sufficient length, this is the main issue I have with the movie.Also, there is one scene in the Arctic, which I find utterly unrealistic, I wished the scenarist had read ""To build a fire"" by Jack London.",The Midnight Sky

Long beautiful silent scenes serve well documentary not cinema. Personally I prefer Tony Scott style where I can't be distracted from screen a second. Watching this movie is like watch 50's but without good dialogues that used to fill those movies at that time.

It's a film that takes you into a thought provoking futuristic journey. I thought the character development was done well, with clever use of subtle inclinations on who this young girl (Iris) may be, without the full revelation until the end. Yes the science will get picked up on those who like to find fault but the general preserpis behind the idea of the film is perfectly plausible. Why not? We live in a world now where every country feels the need to have devastating nuclear weapons rather than spend money on re-wilding the devastating effects humans are causing to the planet we live on.

I really thought the movie would have more than just good direction and acting and that it would also satisfy in terms of plot and storyline, but even though it was almost two hours long, we were left scratching our heads as to what happened to so many of our questions.I'd rate it 3-4 stars just because of special effects and direction, acting wise there wasn't much to judge the movie on but all in all I say this is one movie I wouldn't have minded had I skipped it.",The Midnight Sky

The story is a slow burn but an enjoyable one. The interaction between Clooney and Iris was adorable and believable. The starship and space walk sequence was very well done.

2010,samisalonso,A masterful journey through a lonely astronauts mind,10,26 December 2020,"If you're looking for a new Star Wars/Interstellar, then this movie isn't for you. If you're looking for an introspective journey, based within a scifi/space concept, with excellent visuals, acting, set design, and poignant themes of intrapersonal struggle then you've found a gem.Everyone seems to be hating this movie, however, if you actually read the description of the book which this is based on you might be clued into why the movie is the way it is:""A remarkable and gifted debut novel"" (Colson Whitehead) about two outsiders-a lonely scientist in the Arctic and an astronaut trying to return to Earth-as they grapple with love, regret, and survival in a world transformed.The movie might not have high stakes, it might appear as ""predictable"" on the surface. That is by intent, not by lack of skill or oversight. It explores ones choices, it makes us question what we value and the path we ultimately choose. This might not be an action packed Lucas Films or Marvel Studios production, but it is deeper and richer in meaning than any of those films. It is a real, honest attempt at depicting true human struggle. The ultimate struggle is accepting and coming to terms with ourselves, and then ultimately letting go. This movie does that eloquently and without additional fan fare. In our present society, with a need for constant action and adventure to find distraction, this might not be the right fit for you, and that is okay. However, if you want to slow things down and just for a moment (a 2 hour long moment albeit that) just ponder on your life and life as a whole, this is the right movie for you.",The Midnight Sky
2011,cichoszdustin,If the masses would quiet down they could hear this story,10,28 December 2020,"Apocalyptic stories pull in the audience looking for explosions and impossible hero's and those seeking the dark side of what we as people are capable of. I would think this long after the run of flicks like Armageddon, Days After Tomorrow and 2012 (to only name a few), audiences would see there's more to this genre then thrills and chills.This is a beautifully sad story of regret. Regret from one man and an entire planet. It's not a globe trotting save the day tale, but like watching something beautiful die because you know it has too. It still hurts but it has to be done. I loved the narrative not holding the watchers hands and telling us this is what happened to earth and why and how. It's about loss on such a grand scale.Could be just the right place at the right time in this dumpster fire of a year that is 2020 for me to see this and react, but I applaud this film for showing there's much more to regret then what is blasted from every social media platform and news outlet. I recommend if you're feeling sad and calm. A time when you need to just see what you feel on screen.The music was a poem to the cloud of stars that was emotion within this script.Not the best movie ever made by a long shot, but just the right thing to see after such an exhausting year to let the long sad sigh out.

This time its George Clooney deciding to do a Brad Pitt deciding to do a Interstellar.I like movies that are bleak, I love ambigious endings, but this movie falls apart in so many ways and the sappy emotions are so plastered on, one would think its common knowledge that an audience will not feel for characters with no proper character introduction.Further, I do not understand the need to introduce totally nonsenical action scenes into your ""deep and thoughtful"" movie which totally break the suspension of disbelief. The god awful Ad Astra was guilty of this even more, and while TMS is not AS bad it did givee flashbacks to that atrocity every ten minutes when it decided it had to wake up the audience.Avoid like the plague!

2013,mikeanderson96,Underrated,8,29 December 2020,"Normally I would have looked at the reviews of this film & given it a miss, but seeing that Christmas TV was particularly poor this year & the cinema was closed, I settled in with my wife to watch this on Netflix. The reviews do not reflect the reality. The film pushes way above your average film critics viewpoint & expectations & delivered a memorable film in a season of dross.
The film is based around an apocalyptic Earth, from the viewpoint of George Clooneys lone scientist based in a research base in the Artic Circle, with a mysterious child, abandoned by his hurriedly evacuated colleagues for company on one hand & a returning spaceship having being sent out to discover a potential new world, a recently discovered Jovian Moon, with a crew concerned at not being able to contact the Earth on the other.
The films poor ratings seem to be on account of the fact that it's neither a purely scientific space exploration movie (like the Martian - but then like the Martian outside of a documentary, what is?) or space fantasy (like Interstellar), but that is it's USP in, to my mind, successfully chartering a path between both. It's a thought provoking intelligent drama, without being too clever, thereby pleasing an inquisitive mind not too overly fussed about pure scientific correctness, while at the same time with the appropriate amount of drama for a film seeking to maintain a sense of realism in portraying an environmentally dying World.
The accusation of boring seems to be particularly harsh & well wide of the mark. Yes it's not Fast & Furious in space, but I'd have no interest in watching that. The fantasy market is well crowded with such fare. It has enough action to give the constant impression of life teetering on the edge of existence & is therefore no more a bore than Gravity, Interstellar or the Martian, films I thoroughly enjoyed, but that have been rated far higher than this for distinctions of tension, dramatic effect & flow that I can't clearly decipher.
A really good movie, far underrated & one in which the critics views can be parked for an enjoyable & memorable 2 hours.",The Midnight Sky

2019,alexazhu,"Definitely not ""sci""-fi",3,27 December 2020,"As a story, it's a decent drama. It's a bit more a slow burn than typical movies today, but enjoyable. It's shot beautifully and has a good score. This movie has some of the most visually engaging and believable high-tech backgrounds I've seen. But somehow, it manages to blindly blunder its way into a disaster.With a budget of $100M, you'd think the producers could hire at least a high-school science teacher as a consultant, but the science and tech flaws require a suspension of disbelief comparable to something like Final Destination or Scream. I'm not talking about small gaffes that require specialized knowledge of astrophysics or technology, but plot holes large enough to fly the Aether through.I can excuse the previously unknown moon of Jupiter because that's required for the premise of the movie.But that's just the tip of the rotten iceberg.
What is this alternate reality Earth where airborne radiation takes weeks (months?) to spread?
How do they lack the technology to set up a repeating transmission on the radio? Why must there be a person physically on both ends for any form of communication to work?
How did society completely collapse so fast not a single radio or TV transmission went out with any information, yet so slowly that they were able to organize an orderly evacuation of a small Arctic research base? Electromagnetic signals don't just suddenly vanish after a certain distance.
Why do the navigation computers on the ship simply stop working once they go off course? Not even during the Apollo program did astronauts have to calculate their trajectory by hand.
How is there an unmapped asteroid field so close to Earth? What the hell does ""unmapped"" even mean here? This isn't Star Trek where we're light-years away from ground-based telescopes.I bet this would have been a good movie if set sometime earlier. Maybe in the 19th century, with a plague wiping out most of the population and the crew of a ship somewhere finding a somehow untouched island with a working telegraph connection to a scientist in the Arctic. But I'm sure some ""smart"" consultant decided that flashy tech and ""sci-fi"" sell better, so we get this abomination of a film.",The Midnight Sky

Wasn't making much sense and when I read the reviews, when I went to figure out who the Hispanic male character was (Weeds), I was beginning to agree. The next morning I put it on and watched from scratch just to see what I had not noticed the day before.It was clearly a parable about the destruction of the Earth, but not until watching the space scenes carefully and thinking it might be a play to capturing some of the audience from Gravity that it occurred to me the girl may have been a figment of his imagination as he was to Sandra Bullock in gravity, (a la The Sixth Sense).Armed with these thoughts in the back of my mind, I went on to watch the whole thing start to finish. And with those understandings this highly disjointed movie actually made some sense, especially in the last 30 minutes or so.

First, it is no longer necessary to point out that any kind of world apocalypse will be caused by global warming, it is now a given. However, when it comes to applying the laws of physics, this movie looks like it was written by your typical global warming denier. I think it is fair to say that Sharknado was scientifically more relevant than this movie.
Second, there is nothing else to add, this movie is not worth it at all. There is nothing good about it.
There are plenty of other bad movies that don't deserve the time of writing a review. However, this socially engineered piece of #### is something we will have to get used to from now on. Hollywood has rewritten the rules, get ready for much more of this very bland Bolshevik goulash. I hope covid sticks around for a few more years, it is the only thing that can slow down Tinseltown.
Instead of introducing the apocalypse at the beginning of the movie with ""Earth 2049"", the apocalypse should be introduced: ""Earth 2020 this movie""

People have to remember it's a movie and sometimes you have to put the obvious aside. As with almost every movie that involves some kind of flight, or military action for that matter, if you wanted to be technical with the movies you'd never watch it because it's almost always wrong!!
You have to assume that the catastrophe on planet was such an event that there was no time to transmit any type of distress call to any airborne or inflight craft. Those left after the event were evacuated and killed by radiation poisoning. You must assume that all populated centers have been compromised and that there really is no hope. So GC knowing this goes to a station where the last remnants of life could survive till the very end of the radiation consuming the world. He goes there so he can get in contact with his daughters crew and turn them around to save humanity. Also, for those who didn't figure it out the little girl is his daughter and a figment of his imagination through the movie. He was alone just as SB was is gravity.

So he travels to find better equipment while earth is supposed to be on its way to become inhabitable - and then stops at a crashed plane - why? Spaceship returns (why?) and random stuff happens while the spaceship flies back. Also were other people supposed to leave?
Then the science.. There's so much wrong here. There's gravity in one part of the spaceship and then it shifts to none and then back to gravity again. Outside they secure themselves with one carabiner, then two. The heartbeat of a baby is apparently aprox 80/min (it's just too easy to check this wth you need youtube nothing else)... And apparently the earth scientist needs better equipment - because if you leave one person behind, why wouldn't you leave them with the right equipment?

Yes, the pacing isn't always great, and yes the sci-fi or action parts aren't particuarly original, but they succeed in being thrilling enough. There is solid acting on all parts, beautiful visuals, and a bravery in leaving questions unanswered that I personally appreciate.

2102,toddsoloved,You missed the point,8,6 January 2021,"Here is my interpretation of the story:Young scientist Augustine chose not to meet girlfriend Jean's daughter (we assume he was the father) when he had the chance (the girl was 7 or 8 at the time).
When Dr. Augustine was in his 50s and terminally ill, the earth suffered a deadly event. He made the choice to stay alone at an Arctic observatory (he knew he would be dying either place) when all other occupants escaped by chopper to underground shelters.
Dr. Augustine needed to warn the space station Aether about conditions on Earth, to tell the crew of 5 they would be better off returning to K-43 (a habitable Moon of Jupiter). Augustine ran into many life-threatening hazards as he looked for a way to communicate with Aether. Isolated as he was, he would not have survived had he not had the motivation of also protecting an IMAGINARY little girl, pretending her to be the daughter he regretted not raising.
It turns out that the real-life daughter he had refused to meet grew up to be a science / communications officer on board the Aether, named Sully. Sully was pregnant by Captain Ade with a girl they were planning to COINCIDENTALLY name Iris.
The nifty way this film is presented is that viewers discover these connection as the story goes along. The connections are supposed to be fun to figure out. They were for me. The scene in which an evacuating blonde mother frantically fears her daughter was left behind makes us think a girl was left, but I propose that it just suggested the idea to Augustine's troubled mind. That's why Iris evaporates in the final scene. She was never actually there. Very tricky. Watch it again and try it with this premise I propose.",The Midnight Sky
