0,SnoopyStyle,not that funny but not racist,5,10 July 2016,"Tommy 'White Knife' Stockburn (Adam Sandler) was raised by Indians. In town, he battles the left-eye gang who all scooped out their right eyes. He needs $50k to save his biological father robber Frank (Nick Nolte). He decides to steal the money from the dishonorable. Along the way, he recruits five others who all turn out to also be Frank's sons. They are half-Mexican Ramon (Rob Schneider) with a burro, dim-witted Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), incomprehensible mountain man Herm (Jorge Garcia), drunken Danny (Luke Wilson) who can hold his breath, and pianist Chico (Terry Crews) who sheepishly reveals that he's half-black.This is all very ridiculous coming from Adam Sandler and his gang. Most of it is not funny. This is a failed attempt at Blazing Saddles. It has some outlandish ideas. Some of them are actually good at spoofing westerns. The left-eye gang is nice. Doubleday is pretty funny but it doesn't all work that well. It's flat for the most part. The six leads are simply not that funny.The one thing I defend Sandler for is that this is not racist against native culture. There are racist portrayals but they are done to mock racism. Schneider's Ramon is an over-the-top stereotype but he is one of the heroes. I think Sandler has worn out his welcome with the critics and everyone is all too ready to trash him. This is definitely not 'Jack and Jill'.",The Ridiculous 6
1,Prismark10,The Sons of Nick Nolte,4,19 December 2015,"Adam Sandler as part of his Netflix deal dusts off some of his older, rejected scripts and slashes down on the budget. No overseas filming for Sandler here mainly it is the studio back lot and on location in New Mexico.Sandler plays a white man raised by Indians when his mother was murdered when he was a child. He has learned all sorts of crazy fighting skills and is due to get married soon to a beautiful girl at the reservation.However his long lost father (Nick Nolte) tracks him down and tells him that he is dying and has fortune stashed away somewhere. It turns out that Nolte is a notorious outlaw and robber and he is soon tracked down and taken by his old gang that he has double crossed.Sandler is on the hunt to retrieve him and on his search he finds out that his father had children from many other women. These siblings make up the Ridiculous 6, apart from Sandler (of course) these brothers tend to have some issues. Such as stupidity, more stupidity and even more stupidity.The film is Blazing Saddles meets The Magnificent Seven. Add in some Monty Python and Wizard of Oz and you get a rough idea what this film tries to be.As a comedy it cannot hold a candle to Blazing Saddles even though there is a lot of absurd humour. A donkey that craps like a fire- hose, a one eyed gang, a man with a strong neck which gives the term gallows humour a new twist and a rapping Mark Twain.There is a strong story which is inspired by the likes of John Wayne westerns such as The Sons of Katie Elder. You sense their maybe some loose plot threads but in fact it was all rather predictable once they all met up with their father.I felt the mish mash of different genres and styles was clumsy at times. It was not too funny and 20 minutes too long. It could had been a sharper and more funnier film at 90 minutes.",The Ridiculous 6
2,nogodnomasters,This is so much better than a cantalope,5,8 January 2018,"Tommy (Adam Sadler) meets his dad who left him to Indians to raise. He is taken captive and Tommy must raise $50,000 to save him. In doing so he meets 5 unlikely individuals who are his half brothers. The film is no ""Blazing Saddles."" It is filled with clichés and gross sex humor. The humor was hit and miss and most of the time it missed miserably in its juvenile attempt to be funny. Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of adult humor.",The Ridiculous 6
3,kosmasp,Ridiculous indeed,2,18 January 2017,"If that is your thing, than go ahead. Also if you are an Adam Sandler fan anyway (or one of his usual guys he's hanging out with of course). But there are new additions. And while I'm not that surprised that Nick Nolte is on board (Al Pacino and other have gone that way too), I didn't recognize Jorge Garcia. You may remember him from Lost (as Hurley), but he's wearing a lot of stuff in this, which kind of hides him. Not to mention that he doesn't really talk.While it tries to walk a like of being as silly as possible, but also to have some weight/gravitas, I'd say it fails miserably. Not to mention that running two hours it's way too long. There are poop jokes throughout, kind of woven into the story if you give it the benefit of the doubt. But generally speaking the jokes are missing. Unless you can laugh at ridiculous stuff ... which brings us back to the title ...",The Ridiculous 6
4,classicsoncall,"""Teach them not to mess with the Stockburn Brothers.""",6,3 July 2017,"1974 brought us ""Blazing Saddles"" and some four decades later, the comedy Western is stood on it's head with a movie so ridiculous it had to be called ""The Ridiculous 6"". The concept wasn't so bad, but when you get so many Saturday Night Alumni involved in one place at one time, you're just asking for trouble. In addition to principals like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, you had cameos from folks like Jon Lovitz (Ezekiel Grant), David Spade (General George Custer), Chris Kattan (John Wilkes Booth) and Norm MacDonald (a customer at the Golden Nuggets). If I missed any I apologize, they kept popping up at such a furious pace it was hard to keep track.There's some funny stuff going on in the story to be sure, but the film is brought down a considerable notch with the vulgar humor and the burro who couldn't help itself whenever he broke wind. In his case, he kept breaking mini-mud storms, if you know what I mean, and once would have been enough but the writers just couldn't help themselves. Stuff like that just panders to the lowest common denominator.I had to laugh when Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) turned bad guy against son Tommy/White Knife (Sandler) and the rest of his boys, explaining how one should ""Never bring a knife to a gunfight"". It sounded like something President Obama once said, though it's doubtful he ever found himself in a compromising position in Jawbone Falls, Sweet Hog Rock or Rattler's Gulch. At least the screenwriters got the chronology correct for the characters they introduced in cameo parts, like Mark Twain, Wyatt Earp, George Custer and Abner Doubleday.You know, John Ford and John Wayne have to be spinning in their graves with this absurdist take on the Western genre. You can pretty much bet they never came across a formation in Monument Valley like the penis rock the Ridiculous Ones found in Silver Canyon. All in all, I'd have to say that using the term 'ridiculous' in the title takes some of the edge off what one might otherwise expect in a film like this, because it's all of that. And just to show you how ridiculous the movie really is, the actor portraying Mark Twain is Vanilla Ice. Can you get any more ridiculous than that?",The Ridiculous 6
5,neil-476,Silly but funny,7,30 March 2016,"White Knife was born Tommy Stockburn, but was raised by the Apaches after his mother was murdered. Having encountered his natural father, he has to raise money in order to ransom him. In the course of this, he discovers that he has a number of half-brothers, and they join him on his quest.The synopsis of this Netflix original sounds like a standard traditional western: this Adam Sandler vehicle is anything but. A large and stellar cast joins Sandler on his quest, and take pleasure in making themselves look foolish as they deliver an indiscriminate barrage of humour: sight gags, poo gags, anachronism gags, genre spoofing gags, even the occasional witty gag.This film made me laugh more than it should have, probably, and there were three things I liked in particular.One, it made me care about the characters. Two, Sandler played the central character absolutely straight. Three, Taylor Lautner was a revelation as dim-witted brother little Pete. I've had little time for him as teen hunk, but he is hysterical in this.I loved it.",The Ridiculous 6
6,FlashCallahan,A ridiculous fix.......,5,12 December 2015,"So the plot goes a little something like this.....Tommy was orphaned as a child by an unknown killer. Raised by Native Americans, he now goes by the name of White Knife, and leads a reasonably peaceful life.Nick Nolte comes along and barely audibly declares that he's White Knifes father, and they bond a little, until Danny Trejo comes along and kidnaps him because he owes him $50'000.Tommy vows that he will not let his father suffer the same fate as his mother, so goes after him, along the way he forms a gang called the ridiculous six, and they all happen to be half brothers.......It's a little difficult not to watch this under the strange pseudo awareness that this is the beginning of the end for Sandler, once a sure thing when it came to the box office. And if it wasn't for the energy of the supporting cast, this would be a horrid affair, because Sandler looks so withdrawn and unoccupied that it almost becomes its own subplot.Gone are the days where he had the energy of Billy Madison, or even Little Nicky, where he looked like he was having fun making a movie, it just seems that the failure of Blended has really hit the man hard, after all, anything with Drew Barrymore and himself starring where on the high end of the Sandler quality output.This is only his third film released since then (Hotel Transylvania 2 is voice only), but even in The Cobbler, and Pixels, he's had that same depressed look on his face ever since.As for the film, it's what you'd expect. The production values appear to be a lot lower than other Sandler films, and although some of the cinematography in the long shots are beautiful, it all feels shot on a set cheap.But again, with Sandler's movies, it's the pure WTF-ery, that makes the film all the more watchable, from Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, to the most random Home Alone reference I've ever seen in a film (and that's the only time in the film where I actually chortled a little).But as I've already said, it's the rest of the cast that really bring the film alive, and although it's really only Wilson's character who actually has a decent backstory, the rest of the brothers have their own set of traits to distinguish them from one another (even though these are purely of cultural and mental traits).Sandler regulars have their obligatory cameos, and again, they standout from the rest of the narrative, Buscemi is the Basil Exposition of the film, Tuturro is the founder of Baseball, and although the references to the sport won't really translate to the UK, it's still pretty clever.But at the end of the day, it's Sandler's movie, and he looks like he couldn't care less about being a part of this, he looks distant from everybody else, and the fact that the final third of the film is probably the darkest a Sandler film has ever been, probably explains a lot as to where his creative mind is at the moment.It's not the disaster that most are claiming it to be, but it's not the turning point that Sandler needed to get him back to where he was ten years ago.The man needs a time out, to get happy, and possibly swallow his pride and go for broke and do the sequel to The Wedding Singer.",The Ridiculous 6
7,phd_travel,Not that bad - mix of lol and crude,7,24 January 2016,"Alternately laugh out loud and very low brow crude jokes, I kind of enjoyed about 60% of this Netflix comedy by Adam Sandler. It's not as consistently funny as ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" but it has it's moments. Some jokes are funny then there are some very bad jokes that fall flat. But the good jokes are enough to make this comedy worth one watch. The location filming in New Mexico is highly scenic.Each one of the comedians is good. Surprisingly Taylor Lautner is very funny as the halfwit. Looks like he can do comedy from now on. Rob Schneider is good as the half Mexican. Nick Nolte is suited to his role as father to the band of half brothers.There was some controversy about portrayal of Apaches but I don't think it's warranted. They were not portrayed in a negative light rather the opposite.Worth one watch.",The Ridiculous 6
8,trashgang,the donkey and the injans,8,26 July 2020,"Normally I skip Adam Sandler movies because comedy or humor coming out the USA isn't mostly not my cup of tea. And just before this one I 've seen a comedy that was high rated but one I found total crap. So i didn't know if this was going to be my thing.Clocking in at 2 hours it really has to be good to make it worth seeing for 2 hours and yes, I did like it and yes, Ilaughed it out loud sometimes, stupid simple situtaions that makes it slapstick style or even just funny. The beginning, injans in stead of Indians, yep, that already worked out for me. And the donkey, men, hilarious.
Sure, it do has it flows, the cricket moment is maybe a bit too long but overall, I enjoyed it a lot and hey, Adam Sandler is on my list now.Gore 0/5

10,namashi_1,"Not Ridiculous, but Barely Any Good!",5,14 December 2015,"'The Ridiculous 6' tries to be a really funny western, but it only works in limited doses. While the humour is outright vulgar & racist, it still manages to deliver a few laughs. 'The Ridiculous 6' Synopsis: An outlaw who was raised by Native Americans discovers that he has five half-brothers; together the men go on a mission to find their wayward, deadbeat dad.'The Ridiculous 6' isn't funny enough, which frankly, is its biggest problem. There is no sin in cracking jokes that offend you (I mean, come on, Adam Sandler is the lead here), but they ought to be funny & add to the proceedings. While I did laugh at times, I overall didn't get the amount of laughs I expected from this one.Tim Herlihy & Adam Sandler's Screenplay needed a funnier spirit. Also, why is the film stretched beyond 90-minutes? Frank Coraci's Direction is decent. Cinematography & Editing are ordinary. Performance-Wise: 'The Ridiculous 6' has a huge ensemble, but the ones who stand out are in this order. Rob Schneider (perfectly goofy), Terry Crews (lively), Jorge Garcia (good) & Nick Swardson (game, as always). Of the rest of the cast, especially Sandler & the likes of Nick Nolte & Harvey Keitel, look bored.On the whole, 'The Ridiculous 6' is limited laughter.",The Ridiculous 6
11,StevePulaski,"On the bright side, none of us had to pay extra, leave our homes, or put on pants to witness this atrocity",1,14 December 2015,"Adam Sandler, in the last five years, give or take, has become one of the most divisive names in cinema; the name either inspires nostalgic thoughts of belly laughs from previous years, be it from Sandler's early films or his Saturday Night Live skits, or it inspires groans and remarks of unusually mean-spirited proportions. With the first half of this new decade down, he has given us Jack and Jill, Pixels, That's My Boy, Just Go With It, and Grown Ups 2, some of the most critically panned pictures.With that, Sandler has become something of a risky box office commodity for Hollywood; while he does indeed make studios money, he attracts a lot of negative press. Because of this it's understandable why, in addition to the touchy subject matter in an exhaustively politically correct society, Sandler's latest picture, The Ridiculous 6, endured a rather low-key release on Netflix's Watch Instantly platform rather than a heavily marketed release in over 2,000 theaters across America. Netflix has signed a four-movie deal with Sandler, but after The Ridiculous 6's incomparably negative reactions from critics and audiences forced the streaming company to minimize its prominence on the film's site, I assume the forthcoming three pictures will be released to the public with a lot more four-letter words mumbled under CEO Reed Hastings' breath as he cuts his losses and moves forward accordingly.The Ridiculous 6 is an atrocious film, but atrocious in an unsurprising way, frankly. It's a satire on American Westerns, which, in the present, need to look to Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West as some kind of contemporary benchmark of quality, something that says a lot in itself. The film is a tireless array of physical sight gags and grossout comedy helmed by some huge names in the industry ostensibly doing their best to be the most insufferable screen presences of the year.The film revolves around the nonchalant Tommy ""White Knife"" Stockburn (Adam Sandler in a character boasting less personality than his character in Pixels, who has found himself caught in the center of vicious gangs due to his engagement to a Native woman. Tommy believes he is just a simple orphan, until he meets a bank robber named Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte), who claims he is Tommy's biological father and that his mother was shot by a man with tattoos on his hand when he was a young boy. Frank also reveals to Tommy that he has $50,000 buried in the middle of a field before he is kidnapped by Cicero (Danny Trejo) and held for the hefty ransom.In efforts to rescue his husband, Tommy discovers he also has five half brothers: they are a Mexican donkey-rider named Ramon (Rob Schneider in his ongoing streak of never playing a tolerable character), a giddy, mentally-retarded man named Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), the large and feral Herm (Jorge Garcia), a black pianist named Chico (Terry Crews), and Danny (Luke Wilson), Abraham Lincoln's bodyguard who failed to protect him from no one else but John Wilkes Booth. Together, the gang form ""The Ridiculous 6,"" a bumbling but well-meaning sextet that attempts to find their father all while avoiding dangers such as rebel gangs, Wyatt Earp's (country singer Blake Shelton) sharp-shooting skills, and ""Injuns."" It seems that both Sandler and Tim Herlihy, the screen writing duo on this project, concocted a list of the most intolerable attributes they could include in a film and haphazardly sewed a film together conjoining those scenes which produced little in the way of a plot. The way The Ridiculous 6 just wears on a helpless viewer, beating them down with sterile comedic setups, characters that are simultaneously underwritten and overdone, and acting from nearly everyone involved that just tries too hard to resonate in a humorous way, is depressing. The strongest actor in the film, playing the most consistently funny and likable character, is Vanilla Ice, who plays Mark Twain in the film's sole good scene involving a staged robbery by the six before Twain, Earp, and a few others.The problem with Western satires is that most of the material is well-charted ground by now: how many more times can we see the eclectic and specific names of Native Americans made fun of, the fact that bumbling white people are uncultured and stole the land from the Natives, or the invention of popular conventions such as baseball that we know today? Slam MacFarlane's admittedly mediocre attempt to revitalize the genre, but he at least came with a thesis of showing how miserable and inconvenient life in the West would've been. Sandler just brings his brand of mindless stupidity to a different setting and turns recognizable faces (most notably Taylor Lautner, who is just unbelievably bad and unfunny here) and talented actors into the most unlikable cast of buffoons I've seen this year.Give Sandler credit in that he, at the very least, didn't make us pay any extra, leave our homes, or put on pants to see a film that's really not even good enough for a direct-to-Comedy-Central release. The Ridiculous 6, which also parodies The Magnificent Seven, though, because of timing, seems to ride the coattails of Quentin Tarantino's forthcoming Hateful Eight, is an abysmal comedic affair, and that, above all, given Sandler's recent string of films and the dumping of his next four films on Netflix, is the most unsurprising thing about this entire mess of a film.Starring: Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Jorge Garcia, Taylor Lautner, Terry Crews, Luke Wilson, Nick Nolte, Steve Zahn, Danny Trejo, Vanilla Ice, Blake Shelton, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Will Forte, Chris Kattan, and Harvey Keitel.

12,Hellmant,Pretty much everything you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie.,5,15 December 2015,"'THE RIDICULOUS 6': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The first film in Adam Sandler's exclusive four-movie deal with Netflix, is this western-comedy flick. It stars Sandler, as an outlaw who was raised by Native Americans; that learns he has five half-brothers. The six newly united siblings go on a mission, to rescue their father (played by Nick Nolte). The movie also stars Terry Crews, Jorge Garcia, Taylor Lautner, Rob Schneider and Luke Wilson; it features cameos by the likes of Will Forte, Steve Zahn, Danny Trejo, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. It was directed by Frank Coraci (who also directed Sandler in 'THE WEDDING SINGER', 'THE WATERBOY', 'CLICK' and 'BLENDED') and it was written by Sandler and Tim Herlihy (the two have scripted many movies together, dating back to 1995's 'BILLY MADISON'). The film is pretty much everything you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie, whether it's just streaming on Netflix or not.The story takes place in the Old West, where Tommy Stockburn (Sandler) was raised by Native Americans. Tommy, who's also known as 'White Knife', is supposed to marry a Native girl, named Smoking Fox (Julia Jones). His plans are put on hold, when he's visited by a bank robber, named Frank Stockburn (Nolte), that claims to be his father. A group of bandits, lead by Cicero (Trejo), follow Frank to Tommy's village; and kidnap him. They want Frank to lead them to his last 'big score'. It's up to Tommy then, to rescue his father. On his adventure he meets five half-brothers, he never knew he had, that help him. The movie is mildly entertaining; some parts are funny, but most others aren't. No part of the film is laugh-out-loud funny, in my opinion, but at least the movie isn't as stupid, or as painful to watch, as a lot of other recent Sandler comedy films are. It's also not boring, and it looks all right. I definitely wouldn't say the movie is a complete waste of time; but it's not a good film either.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/HX4VW0mIkCc",The Ridiculous 6
13,thesar-2,Ridiculous is too kind a word,1,7 January 2016,"It's hard to narrow down the worst aspect of this steaming pile of crap, but probably close to the top of that list was the waste of two precious human hours of material a three-year-old wouldn't find funny. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? How did any of the comedians (or formally reputable actors) in this movie finish a scene and actually think they nailed it? Who was the first to sell their soul? And why hasn't Netflix gone bankrupt, or better, sued for this crime against humanity?Granted Adam Sandler movies always try to sh|t on his fans, haters and critics alike, but not one joke, slapstick attempt or movie reference was creative, funny or even a surprise. It's just one hard-to-watch scene after another, like watching a video of a loved one dying on repeat.Too bad this didn't hit theatres. I'd like to see this bomb like, mercifully, Adam's movies should. I know, I know, his fans seem to think he can do no wrong and constantly defend him, even though, a great talent needs no defense, but if he keeps forgetting what real comedic writing is, they are probably going to abandon him. If there is a God. That is.My only hope is, if his career lasts much longer, he'll end up with the same punishment as Alex had in A Clockwork Orange and the movies will be his own.",The Ridiculous 6
14,Irishchatter,Ridiculous and stupid but very different!,7,13 December 2015,"I never knew Adam Sandler could pull off a Clint Eastwood voice, he honestly sounds different in this! I think his character being raised as an Indian doesn't really have a good biography. He should've been raised as an ordinary country boy then he would get away with it! I was surprised that he never cracked a single joke like he does in his other movies, it really is weird for him to not be so laid back as he normally is! He really can give us surprises!Omg, seeing Taylor Lauthner as a dumb young man was hilarious! The things he came out with where just unbelievable. I haven't seen him act in a while since Twlight and I never seen him make me laugh before. I really think he did a great job being involved in this film.The soundtrack was good, the storyline was incredibly stupid but it does lighten you up!",The Ridiculous 6
15,Floated2,Slow paced and not funny,2,11 August 2016,"The Ridiculous 6 is yet another Adam Sandler starring film, though this is different than this typical films since it is a western. Also the film was exclusively set on Netflix instead of a theatrical release (studios must have realized the film was not a theatrical release). This film is slow paced from the start, not much happening and the comedy is too forced and most of the gags fall flat and does not appeal or work out well. The supporting actors play their role as they can which is expected in a Sandler film. Rob Schneider steals several scenes which he was the most funny from the other cast. Sandler appears to be sleep walking throughout the film, with many of his lines in a slow paced delivery and not much energy. The film is quite predictable and nothing too excited happens in the end. Final verdict, the Ridiculous may not be Sandler's worst film (Jack & Jill) but this film is up there.",The Ridiculous 6
16,eddie_baggins,If you like comedies then you should avoid this like the plague,1,4 February 2016,"With Netflix slowly but surely making an increased mark on the film world with its original programing and distribution rights, recent times has seen the streaming giant enter into the world of original films that forgo usual cinematic releases with high profile films appearing exclusively into people's lounge rooms with promotion done through the service.Last year saw two high profiled entries into the catalogue of films Netflix was helping to finance and distribute. The first being the powerful and important Beasts of No Nation, a stunning film in many ways and one that can count itself unlucky to have been shunned by the Academy Awards. It showcased just what Netflix can achieve through its newly drafted plans, but then in December of last year came the second film, The Ridiculous 6.The first of 4 films that have been agreed upon between Netflix and one time Box Office superstar Adam Sandler, the previous biggest comedy actor on the planet was given a budget in excess of $60 million and a chance to invite all of his friends along for the ride in what could well be one of the least funny comedies of the modern era and a nailing shut and burying of Sandler's career coffin that may very well be unlikely to ever be dug up again.An infuriatingly lazy film that therefore deserves a lazy analysis, Ridiculous 6 looks to replicate the success of Western comedy gems like Blazing Saddles but what we as an audience get is a 2 hour exercise in lame brained antics of a bunch of people who should know better, doing things that are neither funny, inspired or even slightly interesting.From carrots being used as weapons, Vanilla Ice (yes the rapper) appearing as legendary writer Mark Twain and certain appendixes being used to play the piano, the funniest thing about The Ridiculous 6 (other than the fact Netflix's money was clearly not spent on production values) is how low one time teen heartthrob Taylor Lautner's career has sunk with his role as mentally handicapped Lil' Pete, who clearly took no heed from Robert Downy Jr's advice in Tropic Thunder.To speak at length of Adam Sandler himself would be giving him attention he doesn't deserve as he once more clearly couldn't care less about the whole she-bang but there are no excuses for performers like Luke Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Jon Turturro or the increasingly near death looking Nick Nolte to be involved in such a low-brow experience. Stars like Rob Schneider and David Spade deserve no better than this but for Sandler to have convinced so many to join this ride, the pay must have been too good to pass up.Saved from zero star quality death quite literally by a few tiny snippets of humour and an unrightfully hilarious camp fire sing along, The Ridiculous 6 gets the Sandler/Netflix team up off to a mind boggling bad start but Netflix subscribers seem to care little, as in quick fire succession The Ridiculous 6 became one of their most streamed movies ever, suggesting the Sandler/Netflix crimes against humanity are unlikely to end with the next arduous experience.½ a scooped out eyeball out of 5",The Ridiculous 6
17,TheMovieDiorama,The Ridiculous 6 is unequivocally ridiculously atrocious.,1,13 July 2019,"Y'know, sometimes I like to think that Adam Sandler gets a bad reputation because of his questionable work in 'Jack and Jill'. I graciously give him opportunities to win me over with his ""charismatic"" charm. But then, for some unknown reason, we get ridiculous tripe like this. A parody of western classics like 'The Magnificent Seven' but with spoofed toilet humour found in 90s teen comedies. Who approved this script? Is there an audience for this abomination? Because sweet Texan lord, this was as ""funny"" as a fly drowning in a glass of water with a donkey exploding its guts onto a wooden wall (actually happens in the film). Urgh. A cool-headed man discovers that his biological father is kidnapped, and coincidentally meets his other five brothers who team up to rescue him.Lazy, offensive, unfunny, terribly directed, atrociously edited and badly performed. I cannot, and will not, find a redeeming factor in this festering pile of excrement, left out in the old western sun. I refuse to bore you with the ridiculous amount of criticisms, so I'll showcase some highlights. The brothers consists of a Mexican burro rider, a mentally challenged exaggerated imbecile, a feral mountain-man who speaks gibberish, the bodyguard of Abraham Lincoln and an African-American pianist. The hilarity, apparently, is that they have nothing in common. Lautner decimates his career even further than 'Twilight' did. Nolte couldn't give a toss. Sandler attempts to imitate his best Clint Eastwood impression, but face plants the dusty road with his monotonous, boring, expressionless performance.A Native American named ""Never Wears Bra"". Really? Sandler continuously conducting forward rolls miraculously transforming into, and I kid you not, a tumbleweed. A twenty minute scene ""hilariously"" recreating the moment Doubleday invented baseball, with Chinese immigrants, which has no place in the plot whatsoever. I can't. I just can't be bothered. It's so irrefutably terrible, that I would advise getting a colonoscopy instead. No more chances Sandler.",The Ridiculous 6
18,subxerogravity,Very ridiculousbut in a so-so way.,6,19 December 2015,"It's not the best effort Adam Sandler has done but in comparison to some of the stuff he puts out in theaters lately, this Netflix original is entertaining at least. The opening title card which states that the Ridiculous Six was shot it amazing 4k makes it feel like a parody of sorts to Quentin Tarantino's upcoming Hateful 8, which was shot in amazing ultra 70mm. I don't know how much of a connection the two movies have but it help set a tone for the movie that makes it more enjoyable.For the most part the movie is cool to sit through, then it has its WTF moments that get really outrageous. Sandler has no limit of friends he accumulated over the years, and I think all the regulars from the Sandler pictures, like Rob Schneider who plays one of the six, make an appearance in the film, but mostly as well done cameos that make for some of the more funny moments in the movie.Sandler plays a watered down version of, Don't mess with the Zohan, who has to save his long lost father, played by Nick Notle, by stealing money. Along the way he discovers five other men who share the same father as he and helps him rescue dear old dad. I actual like Taylor Lautner as the dim witty brother in the movie. Mostly because I've never seen the kid really do comedy. Jorge Garcia has some good laughs in him as the brother raised in the wild. Feel most sorry for Terry Crews who definitely had the weakest jokes of the lot. I have to give The Ridiculous 6 a thumbs up. I was not expecting much but I got something I can sit though. It's been a while sense I could say that about something starring Adam Sandler.",The Ridiculous 6
19,iquine,Buffet of Styles,3,11 September 2017,"(Flash Review)You are at a buffet and filling your plate with eggs, tater tots, meatloaf, sushi, fruit, corn and spam and then you trip and spill it on the floor. That is my analogy for this movie. It is an amalgamation of slap stick, Western, potty humor, witty humor, drama and goofy gore. None of which work together well as a cohesive meal. The plot is Sandler's long lost father reappears and shortly thereafter gets taken by bandits to find some buried money that isn't really there so they'll kill him. Sandler feels bad so he tries to get the money to save his father and along the way comes across five of his step brothers. The most clever gag was these guys run into Abner Doublday that actual man who invented baseball and in the scene he sort of invents the rules as he goes. Very strange and randomlike the rest of the movie. Not super funny but it had a few decent moments.",The Ridiculous 6
20,AudioFileZ,Ridiculous Use Of Harvey Keitel Among Other Things (He Actually Is Good),5,22 October 2016,"When I see bad reviews for this movie I'm wondering what the viewer expected? Adam Sandler movies are in a narrow range these days. You either like them, tolerate them, or don't bother. I'd say it's gotten to the point of just those who like them, at least until he decides to step outside of his current formulaic low-brow method of cranking out movies. Apparently, however, he doesn't have to though. So, until he feels a kind of need to awaken and re-imagine who and what he's about movies such as The Ridiculous 6 are to be expected.Sandler, this time, turns his humor toward the western genre. It's not Support Your Local Gunfighter as Sandler rarely wastes a chance to dip into double entendres and potty humor. Fact is he can do it pretty well and get away with it. No aspirations of any original ideas or worries from an art standpoint, rather a stringing together of thought up situations of which are a mixed bag of some that work and others that fall flat. Sandler takes the exact straight guy delivering the punch line that he always takes. Really, no surprises at all.What is surprising is how many name co-stars a Sandler production can attract. Obviously the guy is well liked and they like working with him. It's a crazy mix as you get Nick Nolte, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Steve Zahn, Danny Trejo, Vanilla Ice plus Blake Shelton in the same movie. Of course it's wasted talent thrown in with amateurish talent, but it's Sandler's humor.So, in the end the movie is just watchable enough to not dis outright. It has it's moments which are too far in between to to call it even a left-field minor good comedy. It is what it is and if you like Sandler it's good enough to watch. Perhaps the best moment was the song in Keitel's saloon which isn't a very high recommendation admittedly.",The Ridiculous 6
21,guisreis,Ridiculous,5,29 December 2015,"""The ridiculous 6"" has a very good casting, it is very well filmed, has beautiful scenario, nice Western-style letters and soundtrack, but... it is ridiculous. It is not a complete disaster, one or another joke is OK, but most of its humour is silly, obvious, cliché... simply bad. Comedy Westerns may be good, Excellent examples are ""Little big man"", ""My name is nobody"", ""They call me Trinity"", Blazing saddles"", and Corcucci's ""Compañeros"" and ""The mercenary"". ""The ridiculous 6"" certainly does not join this team. In Hollywood it is common repeating ad nauseaum the same formulae, even when they are bad. Today that happens with abuse of slow motion (as a matter of fact, it is well used in ""The ridiculous 6"", I concede), the conversion of fairy tales to medieval fantasy battles, and bad quality spoof of popular films. Off course Adam Sandler's Netflix project fits he last case, as it has been released very little before Tarantino's new Western ""The hateful 8"". Well, it is just one more waste of time full of money while many good films don't have neither a comparable budget, nor the same opportunities of exhibition.",The Ridiculous 6

23,Matt_Layden,What do people expect?,3,22 March 2016,"I could accuse Adam Sandler of sleepwalking through his roles as of late (Pixels, Grown Ups 2), I could even accuse him of purposely hiring beautiful women to be his leading ladies (Brooklyn Decker, Kate Beckinsale) or how he seems to only do films where he hangs out with his best friends (Grown Ups, The Ridiculous Six)...but I won't. Sandler has been a punching bag for a lot of people lately and deservedly so. The man hasn't made a good film in years and it looks like he doesn't even care to anymore. Simply watch his ""performance"" in Pixels and tell me otherwise. He's made his money, his lazily making more and laughing at us while he does so. Now he has a 6 film deal with Netflix and the first film to come of this is The Ridiculous Six, which has had words such as horrible, travesty, garbage, and racist thrown its way. All of which...are warranted. The Ridiculous Six has Sandler playing an outlaw, raised by Natives who discovers he has five brothers. Together they decide to track down their father and save him from whatever mess he's found himself in. I can't stress how painfully unfunny this mess of a film is. The film is loaded with ""stars"" such as Vanilla Ice and Blake Shelton. Among the usual players of course. Am I getting too old? Is the humour in this film the same as his previous films? I don't think so. Old Sandler had a certain charm. Love him or hate him, he actually had faith in those projects and wanted to succeed. Well, he has and no he doesn't give two craps. He never changes his face once this entire film. He shows no emotion, no range, no acting abilities. Writing this review is painful because of how boring the film is. Stupid gags involving donkey feces, decapitation and stupid native names. The film plays out as set up gag after another with no real sense of story. I did find one redeeming factor here and I want to thank John Turturro. The scene in which we see how baseball was invented was humorous and I would have loved more scenes like this. Skip it, even if you're a fan of his work. This is a sorry excuse for a film that deserves to be burned.",The Ridiculous 6
24,quincytheodore,"The title is not an attempt at self-deprecating humor, it's a warning.",3,13 December 2015,"I'm probably one of the few people who wouldn't judge a movie by Adam Sandler and his ever increasingly bad resume, in fact Hotel Transylvania 2 and The Cobbler were not so bad. However, The Ridiculous 6 is simply awful, just throwing a lot of actors and hopes that it would work out, which it's doesn't. The comedy is very immature, there's not so much one can do with the cast laughing randomly and terrible poop jokes.This is a story of six brothers, whose similarity is their overly reproductive father, as they travel through the Wild West to save said father from a savage gang. The characters are certainly colorful, but they are too insipid, either from fault of their own and unintentionally cringe worthy direction.As one might expect these are your ordinary Adam Sandler's troupe with Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi and the likes. You'd probably know what their character will do just by the first glance. Surprising addition is Taylor Lautner as Lil Pete, an imbecile. He really tries to portray the character and it does work on a couple of occasions, but this is not exactly the appropriate medium to sharpen one's acting skill.Terry Crews and Nick Nolte are pretty good. Nick Nolte as the father does have some depth, his experience also shows as he carries himself well. Terry Crews just has the on-screen quirky presence that audience would not dislike. The rest is mix of random actors, mandatory appearance by Danny Trejo as the villain, a few attractive ladies and Adam Sandler delivering a very stiff performance as eternally saddened protagonist.For comedy, this is as blunt and less refined as possible. Perhaps, only a few jokes actually entertaining in its rather bloated graceless two hours runtime. It's not the worst that could happen, although very close to the bottom, simply because Adam Sandler unfortunately has made even worse things than this.",The Ridiculous 6
25,Screen_Blitz,Dumb western-themed comedy falls short of laughs,4,11 December 2015,"In this western-themed comedy directed by Frank Coraci, Adam Sandler stars as Tommy (nicknamed White Knife), an outlaw raised in a Native American tribe with his father Frank Stockburn (played by Nick Nolte). Tommy has plans on marrying a beautiful Indian woman named Smoking Fox (played by Julia Jones). However, when his father is kidnapped by a league of bandits lead by the cruel Cicero (played by Danny Trejo), he sets out across the west to rob banks to claim the money to free his father. Along the way, he comes across five other outlaws: Ramon (Rob Schneider), Lil Pete (Taylor Lautner), Chico (Terry Crews) Herm (Jorge Garcia), and Danny (Luke Wilson); who he discovers are his half-brothers. These six guys band together to fight off the evil bandits that stand in their way, while protecting the money they need to save their father. This star-studded cast also features Will Forte, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Steve Zahn, and many others. I went into this movie with low expectations based on the trailer. I was, however, attracted by the stellar cast of the some of the funniest actors in Hollywood. Sadly, this movie turned out to be a disappointment, much like last year's western-set comedy 'A Million Ways To Die in The West'. Although the cast does ignite maybe a few laughs, the overall humor tends to get incredibly obnoxious and too dumb to laugh at. I believe only laughed maybe twice throughout the entire time. Like most Adam Sandler comedies, this movie tries so hard to get laughs out from the characters' stupidity, and it fails miserably. The characters only funny for those who can withstand their obnoxious and dim-witted one liners. Furthermore, this movie is supposed to serve as a parody to the classic western 'The Magnificent Seven', but at the same time tries to spoof a Quentin Tarantino flick (possibly his upcoming film 'The Hateful Eight') with its cinematography, and sadly it does not work. The acting, as you might imagine, is not too great either. The only thing this film succeeds at is creating a storyline that somewhats sense. The Ridiculous 6 is not a good movie and falls severely short of laughs, and its quite disappointing for such a star-studded cast. I can only recommend to die-hard Adam Sandler fans, or anyone who can stand obnoxious and dumb dialogue and humor.",The Ridiculous 6

27,Pumpkin_Man,Grown Ups: The Western!!!,10,15 December 2015,"When it comes to Adam Sandler movies, you have to expect it to be dumb and silly. I really love dumb and silly comedies, so I was pretty happy with The Ridiculous 6. It has the right amount of slap-stick, dumb humor, poop jokes, and spoofing historical moments and figures like Abraham Lincoln and a jive Mark Twain. I really like the gang's chemistry together. They all have obvious flaws, but since they are brothers, they never make fun of each other for it. Sandler stars as White Knife aka Tommy Stockburn, a white man raised by Indians. His real dad shows up and tries to re-connect with him, only to be kidnapped and taken ransom by Danny Trejo's character, Cicero. Tommy decides to steal money from the rich and corrupt to try to save his dad. Along the way, he happens to run into men of all different races who share the same dad. The one brother that'll definitely stick out is Taylor Lautner as Little Pete. It's hilarious to see him act all buff in Twilight, then to see him as a bumbling idiot in this flick. If you love silly Adam Sandler movies and the Western genre, I highly recommend THE RIDICULOUS 6!!!",The Ridiculous 6

29,maurice_yacowar,western spoof satirizes current American racism,7,14 December 2015,"Charging The Ridiculous Six with racism is the stupidest response to a film I've come across in years. It's like complaining Gone With the Wind wasn't a weather report. Adam Sandler wrote and stars in a satire of American racism, the current scene and its historic roots. Rejecting its use of Indian stereotypy is senseless. How can you expose America's anti-Indian tradition without showing the anti-Indian tradition?The first three shots establish that theme. Two signs read ""No(misspelled 'Indians') allowed"" and ""Redskins keep out."" That reveals the white men's inferior knowledge, humanity and spelling. His tradition of demeaning native Americans persists down to our own shamelessly stubborn Washington Redskins. Then the newspaper headline gloats ""Cavalry Massacres Godless Apaches."" But as all the Sandler hero's success is based on his ""mystical (power)"" it's clearly the Apaches who have a spiritual connection to the world and the whites who are the godless, driven by lust and greed. Topping it off, the newspaper's smug reader has only one functioning eye — which he eventually plucks out to join the ill-fated Left Eye Gang, only to find his colleagues in fact duped him and preserved the eyes under their patch. Can't trust those whites, man. They're not the men of vision. Indeed, the bigot can't figure what five sacks of flour at 45 cents each should cost. (Clue: $2.25). And he's the superior race?In this white world you can't even trust your father. When the six's vagrant dad (Nick Nolte) proves to have duped his son Tommy the betrayal works on both the personal and the social levels. Tommy leaves him to heaven, or at least to what in the cave will find him, preferring the superior ethic he learned as White Knife from his real father, the Apache chief who raised him. As the bad father betrays all his sons first by abandoning them and their mothers, then by exploiting them, the present finds itself betrayed by the past that created its mythology and values. The 19th century bred the 20th which begat our 21st. America's present self-conception derives from the 19th Century with its highly suspect and dangerous myth that the whites brought a superior civilization to the ostensibly savage Indians. White America brought modernity to the desert but — far worse — an arid, sterile materialism, religiosity and fatal savagery to the spiritual people they conquered. And still suppress. The positive alternative is the titular collection of brothers who join forces to save their unknown dad. A village idiot, a Mexican, a guilt-riddled honky drunk, a mute monster, a black, the converted Indian hero — this racial and class cross-section of unlikely brothers evokes the brotherhood of man that modern America continues to affront. To remind us that the western reflects our current culture the characters frequently slip into contemporary jargon and gestures. Like any period drama, it seems to be about the Then but it's really about the Now. If we didn't have a racist America we wouldn't need — or get — a film that traces its roots back to the white man's conquest of the frontier and its prejudice against any non-whites. Hence the Mexican with his beloved burro and the black piano-player who mercifully doesn't know everyone knows he's black so enjoys being used for music and sex. The Abner Doubleday scene offers exploited Chinese labourers, including one renamed Shortstop. As this scene dramatizes the beginning of modern baseball, the film embodies the roots of modern American racism. It's a response to Sarah Palin's brazen reaction to a black president — ""Give us back our America."" — and the sad Donald Trump show that succeeded her. President Lincoln's assassination signifies the death of the Republican ethic.So that's what the film is doing. It shows racism to satirize racism. ""Just dumped some satire on you General,"" Mark Twain tells General (""Leave the Indians to me"") Custer. But the film is not very good. The Magnificent Seven it's not — nor set out to be. Too many jokes are puerile, like naming native women Never Wears Bra and Beaver Breath, which stoops to the level of the vile man's ""Poca-hot-tits."" So it's Mad Magazine humour, without the sophistication and elegance of Mel Brooks. But still, it's a responsible, ambitious, serious reminder of how racist American culture has been — and worse — continues to be. Hats off to Adam Sandler, and to his knee-jerk critics: ""You must be joking.""",The Ridiculous 6

31,phubbs,The Ridiculous 6,5,15 January 2016,"Yes that's right, I've seen the fabled new, one time, controversial Adam Sandler movie, all the way through! who wants to touch me? (yes I also realise I just totally dated my own review with this dated gag reference, had to be done). So yeah...its a dumb western filled with blatant stereotypes, corny routines, obvious gags and it treats women as nothing more than sexual objects, but in all honesty what did you expect? Firstly its an Adam Sandler movie, and secondly, it has 'ridiculous' in the bloody title! its literately saying to you, this movie is gonna be daft as sh*t, you have been warned. So why all the fuss I don't know.Plot wise its your typical western fare about revenge and...umm, more revenge. Tommy Stockburn (Sandler) has been raised by native Americans (or red Indians to be politically incorrect) because way back as a child his mother was shot dead by a mysterious stranger. His father Frank (Nick Nolte) was an infamous bank robber and just happens to come by Tommy's village to tell him he's his father because plot convenience. Frank speaks of 50K he's buried away and intends to share with Tommy, but before you can say rootin-tootin outlaws, some outlaws turn up that used to be in a gang with Frank and claim the money. Frank lies about the moneys whereabouts as the gang take him hostage to go find it, this gives Tommy time to find the loot in its real location. Alas Tommy is unable to find the loot so he must come up with another way to raise 50K to pay the outlaws and save his dad. The clock is ticking before the outlaws realise that Frank was lying about the moneys location.Now the main lure here must be the stereotypical ridiculous six characters that are all hilariously related to each other, no really its hilarious...OK its not. Sandler is obviously the leader of the gang, the low gravely Eastwood voiced, ice cool loner, raised by native Americans and is super hot with knives. Terry Crews is Chico, a black piano player who hasn't ever admitted to anyone he's actually, possibly, slightly black, and of course despite the fact he's huge...he's actually a real softie. Jorge Garcia plays Herm, a role that probably would have gone to John Belushi or John Candy if they were alive. A big fat slobby, dirty, feral type bloke who can't speak English but everyone understands him anyway. Taylor Lautner embarrasses himself immensely here as the gangs redneck simpleton complete with braces and buckteeth. Luke Wilson plays the dandy type, good looking, athletic, well dressed, but a miserable failure with his last occupation as a bodyguard for Abe Lincoln. Lastly good old Rob Schneider plays the greasy dirty Mexican Ramon who owns a donkey with super powered diarrhea. So there you have a complete array of stereotypes, the white man raised by Indians, the token black guy, the fat slob, the doofus, the dandy and the dirty Mexican. Oh and Nolte, can't understand a bloody word he's saying, not one.Now whilst many might be expecting the biggest load of horse sh*t this side of the Rio Grande, in all fairness, its not that bad...in places. The gang sets out to pinch 50K from various people and places that they consider to be bad or immoral, so they don't feel bad about stealing basically. As you might expect what you get is pretty predictable stuff with some pretty daft action. They rob a bank utilising Ramon's diarrhea filled donkey as a diversion, yes this means the donkey sh*ts all over someone. They steal a huge gold nugget from a casino owned by Smiley Harris (Harvey Keitel), this involved much silly hijinks from the whole gang such as Chico and his piano playing and Tommy with his knife skills. They also steal a huge sum of cash from Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz), Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) in a poker game which involves the whole gang. Yes I did just mention Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, yes it was unbelievably insane casting, yes I admit I quite liked it yet I do not know why, yes I am ashamed of myself.Another rather quirky scene involved John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up with the all American national past time of rounde...errr baseball. I don't know the history behind this actual person, nor do I know the rules of baseball inside out, however I do have a basic knowledge of the game, not that that's necessary to enjoy this scene though...I digress. Anywho, this scene is actually quite amusing as Turturro literately makes up the rules of baseball as he goes along, but only because he's trying to not lose at his own creation. It sounds childish but the fact that Doubleday is useless at his own sport creation, whilst everyone else is getting the hang of it, was actually reasonably funny, mainly because of Turturro's performance.This movie is pretty much like any throwaway silly comedy I've ever seen through my life, it has its moments, it does make you smile at times, and to that affect...its done its job essentially (much like the gloriously stupid Chris Farley comedy 'Almost Heroes'). The cast is impressive, it looks good, surprisingly authentic at times with some quality classic western-esque shots and angles and the musical score appears to be a complete rip-off from 'City Slickers'. Other than that I dunno, I really don't. The controversy for this movie turned out to be exaggerated, and I truly think people are jumping on the Sandler hate bandwagon way too quickly these days. Yes it was garbage mostly, I fully agree, but was it the worst thing I've ever seen? no, no it wasn't (although Lautner may have killed his career).5.5/10",The Ridiculous 6
32,mitsubishizero,Hilariously silly,7,25 May 2019,"I'm amazed at how this has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Is it really that bad? I don't think so. It's not his best but it's still funny. Obviously it's a parody of the classic the Magnificent Seven. A man adopted by Native Americans named Tommy (Adam Sandler) leaves his tribe to help his father who's accumulated so much debt. Along the way he discovers the 5 brothers he never knew he had:A Mexican burro rider named Ramon (Rob Schneider), The mentally handicapped Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), A Mountain Man who speaks unintelligibly named Herm (Jorge Garcia), Former bodyguard of Abe Lincoln named Danny (Luke Wilson) and pianist Chico (Terry Crews) who help him on his quest.What follows are some hilarious scenes and dialogue. A great example's when their father's former gang member tries to kill them as revenge for him stealing his cut only for him to hilariously get his head cut off by Ramon. This leads to his corpse walking and firing a few shots in the air before finally collapsing. The brothers joke about it to death afterwards.Another joke is when Tommy finds out that he has 5 brothers from a woman whom his Dad had a fling with and the detail she goes into explaining when they were together is just hilarious. Another scene is where Ramon's donkey releases a massive load shortly after Ramon and Tommy meet for the first time. According to Ramon that means he likes him. It's gross but in a good way.The characters are likable and funny to watch. They also have enough personality to keep things from getting boring. The historic and pop culture references are funny to watch. There's a scene where Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) meet a casino owner named Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz) and the way they talk modern is just ridiculous. There're moments like that and they're funny to watch.Crazy as it sounds this's actually a good comedy and I highly recommend checking this movie out even if you're not a Sandler fan.

I don't know if that's a sign his film career really is in trouble, or maybe a platform where his work can be seen by more people-?? Anyway, the first reviews I saw for this were not the greatest, however, a lot of the user comments on IMDb have been more down the lines of what I thought of it. I actually thought this was pretty damn funny the whole way through. And I think what actually works for the movie is Sandler, who hasn't really been all that funny for years, just kinda steps off to the sign as the ""straight man"", and lets the rest of the cast and movie guide the humor. This is your comedy western variety in the same vein with something like ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Support Your Local Sheriff"", and more recently of course, ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". And wowza- what a cast! The opening credits didn't even mention everyone, and I'm not going to- you'll see everyone when you see the movie- and I'll let that be a bit of a surprise.The storyline is pretty simple and goofy- Sandler plays a white man raised by Indians LOL. And when his ol' long lost dad (Nick Nolte) tracks him down, events lead him to putting together a posse made up of half brothers! LOL And one of the funniest parts of the film I thought was the mere casting of historical figures Wyatt Earp, Mark Twain and General Custer! I had to check the cast who that was playing Twain- he seemed very familiar. At first I thought it was Matt Stone of ""South Park"" fame, but I was very wrong! LMAO!

36,J_Batek_II,Insulting Parody Of Tarantino & Classic Westerns. Netflix Should Demand A Refund From Sandler.,1,23 July 2019,"Netflix paid a lot of money to Adam Sandler, personally, for future products. Sandler went out and put a film project together, as he normally would - finding producers to fund a film, a writing partner, a location, etc. However, when selecting a theme and writing the script, Sandler deviated from the normal playbook. What Sandler chose to give Netflix was a film HE WANTED TO MAKE, a film that had a lot of negative parody depictions about the history of film and a rival writer/director. However, this is not a film he could have made for a normal distributor, because no one would have paid to see it in theaters. This isn't a film that would have generated mass appeal, because people like old westerns and people like Quintin Tarantino. For the same reasons, this film would have had terrible reviews from media sources that might have wanted to compare it to other new releases in theaters. No, no one would have asked for this film. But, Adam Sandler was paid in advance, so he took advantage of Netflix and handed them a passion project that is an embarrassment to the film industry.I'm not going to list all of the reasons that this is a terrible movie, but I will give one warning to future film makers. Although Adam Sandler thought he was being intellectually clever with some of his jokes (that were probably meant to comment on the depiction of race and culture in film), film writers need to remember that not everyone will understand your jokes. So, when you take chances (over and over again) depicting race and culture in an offensive way, then sometimes you will seem racist. Watching this movie is a very racist experience. 'The Magnificent 7' (1960) was not a racist film. 'The Hateful 8' (2015) was not a racist film. 'The Ridiculous 6' (2015) is a very racist film. And, it's not funny.

It is ridiculous, but most of all, it's stupid, and makes you feel stupid. Adam Sandler, this time in a western setting, piles the poo jokes very high. Sandler and his five brothers with different mothers go off on a quest to save their shared Dad. They steal money from bad people to pay off a ransom. I think of them as a really poor version of Robin Hood and his merry men. All cast members fail to live up to previous standards; Terry Crews is probably the better of them but isn't funny in the slightest. Rob Schneider's Mexican is as painful as his flatulent donkey. Taylor Lautner's stupidity goes full distance ('everybody knows you never go full retard - Kirk Lazarus, Tropic Thunder) and Adam Sandler attempts a Clint Eastwood style serenity that doesn't match the film's tone. And that tone is way low. There's one positive out of this: you won't have to pay any extra to view it. I only hope the next film in the Netflix/Sandler contract is better.",The Ridiculous 6
39,Rendanlovell,Typical Adam Sandler,1,14 December 2015,"'The Ridiculous 6' is one of the worst films to release in 2015. Like 'Pixels' earlier this year Sandler has tried his hardest to make an unwatchable movie. And like 'Pixels', he has come pretty darn close. As the poster says, 'The Ridiculous 6' is a Netflix original film. Basically it's a movie that skipped out on a theater run and went straight to streaming. Just like the far better 'Beasts of No Nation' (which I will be reviewing soon). Obviously this isn't the first Netflix original film and it won't be the last, but as of right now it is the worst. Now, before I go on ripping this film to pieces lets talk about the few things this movie gets right. The main thing that I thought this film did well was its casting. Of course, this excludes Sandler. Like Shyamalan, his name has become next to worthless in both audiences and studios eyes. Most of the other actors are definitely Sandler favorites but they actually seem like they cared about this movie. Some are a nuisance and others are clearly racist but they genuinely seem like they want to be there.Then there's Sandler. The man behind some of the worst films of the last decade. Why is this? Because none of his films are any different. He casts the same exact people in every single one and then doesn't even give a crap about what is going on. His blank stare and monotone reading of his lines is cringe worthy in every film his has made as of late. Including this one. And just like always he casts himself as the hero of the film. The man who can do no wrong. The man who, even when something bad happens, he is somehow scott free. 'The Ridiculous 6' is the epitome of this Sandler cliché. Here he plays a Indian that has some very unclear super powers. Super powers that make him the ""unlikely"" leader of five other completely random people that films pretends are his brothers.People that he happenstances by as he looks for his father. In this one line I have summed up the entirety of this two plus hour film. It's such a simple plot line that, somehow, the film forgets all about for more then half the time. For three forths of this film we watch these 6 stupid, flat characters do absolutely nothing. In an incredibly lousy attempt to pull laughs from thin air. There are SO many completely random scenes that have zero to do with the movie. Scenes that are literally only there to get a gratuitous laugh out of.But the laughs never come. What's worse is that this film isn't a ""so bad it's funny"" kind of movie. It's actually classified as a parody. A parody that is so incredibly dull and long that it can't be viewed as a comedy. This is made worse by how racist this film is. If a character isn't white or black then he is a stereotype. We get stereotypes of Indians, Mexicans, and the mentally handicap. It's so uncomfortable to watch that when the film hits a legitimate joke you can't laugh because of how terrible everything is.'The Ridiculous 6' is a trainwreck. At this point it's clear that Sandler no longer cares about what kind of film he makes. As long as he gets a paycheck there is nothing that he won't ruin. He wastes talented actors time with this pointless film. The script feels as though it was ripped straight from Sandlers last film and slightly modified to ""fit"" the old west. Please do not waste your time on this film. If you feel the need to watch a film on Netflix check out literally anything else.",The Ridiculous 6
40,rollernerd,Majestic White Knife,3,17 October 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings all...after going through dramatic roles in the few months, its time to change the tune and hit some Sandman comedy...that's right, I will be hitting up Adam Sandler movie for the next monthToday's movie review is Western comedy The Ridiculous 6 (2015) where the Sandman plays Tommy aka White Knight, who was raised by the Native American when his mother was murdered. Tommy has an unexpected visit from his long-lost father, Frank Stockburn played by Nick Nolte, who is unexpectedly is kidnapped by a group of outlaws the next day. Tommy sets himself on a quest to save his dad and along the way he meets 5 half-brothers. I won't go through the whole cast or the flick, this movie is funny stupid but more stupid. Heaps of cameos and stars who star in a predictable film which portrays insulting themes around obvious stereotypes. Loads of corny routines and obvious gags but the treatment of women as nothing more than objects takes a toll. The standouts of the film include John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up baseball. The scene is amusing especially when Turturro literately makes up the rules of the game as he goes along just so he doesn't loose. Another funny moment includes Steve Zahn who plays a bandit later in the movie is hilarious. Other then that, it's not the worst film I have watched and if you are a Sandler fan then this rootin-tootin outlaw flick may be your thing. It definitely wasn't mine. I can see why this flick killed Taylor Lautner's career. Overall, 3/10",The Ridiculous 6

But, as it moves along, story that has some basic coherence unfolds and there are many jokes, a fair amount of which work. Those are not some well planned and surprising jokes, but mostly of a sketch variety.It has this quality that seems to have been lost in most modern movies, that you care more about the characters as the movie progresses. Don't get me wrong, you don't care all that much in the end, but, substantially more than at the beginning.There is this sense that much more could have been done here, especially with some sketches, and the overall story, but, Adam Sandler movies have been having such a feel to them for a long time.So, it's a good way to take a rest, have some fun and laughs and not think much about stuff.",The Ridiculous 6

In other cases; be fair and square and save your time.I like the things I just mentioned, in some situations and if I am in that kind of mood... and by remembering very clearly that it is just and only a movie.This is Adam Sandler and his ""parody gang"" at almost their best. The Hateful 8 got competition in it's own special....weird (??) way...A good ensemble of actors. The fact that it has got only close to 6 on IMDb is in my opinion and experience wrong and underrating.The first movie that really digs deep into the act of making a parody of baseball. Yes. You read it right. Baseball. In a western. With Adam Sandler... and Harvey Keitel.Read that the goof section has something about ice cream cone. With all do respect; come on! Do you really think that is a goof?! Very ""hard sense of humour"" from Sandler and the gang.So. I laughed hard many times and saw the movie only for what it is. ""My mom is from Sweden....

All the characters seem what ""off"" but the settings this all plays out in is spot on and gives it that real western feeling.The ending was actually a surprise to me and it is nice to get a great twist in a movie who's main goal is to be funny.The lot of cameos wraps everything nicely up and all 5 of his brothers have a back story that gives a good insight to who they are and what motivates them to go on this adventure.Until tropic thunder I did not really like Adam Sandler movies but because of that one and now this I am somewhat anxious to see what he'll come up with next. Even the guy that was the werewolf in ""twilight"" was good in this(and that's saying a lot) and also Vanilla Ice as a rapping Mark Twain was notable.Comedy is a difficult genre because everybody has a different taste of what's acceptable. Having said that I can understand the low rating on this but as production value this really deserves a little higher but that's just my opinion and everyone has a right to his own.I recommend it but I think if you did not like the over the top humor of tropic thunder you'll probably won't like this one either.I found it very entertaining and hope you do to.Enjoy and laugh your burro of.",The Ridiculous 6

I don't hate Adam as I have seen films of his that were definitely worth the laugh, maybe as ridiculous as the title, there are a lot of fine actors making a cameo here e.g. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi , Terry Crews and a bunch but one can't help but doze off as I didn't find 95% of the scenes funny. I will give credit that Adam Sandler is a creative person but either he sticks to voice over acting like Hotel Transylvania until a material suitable to him pops up in the future. If this is someone else's cup of tea kudos to you.",The Ridiculous 6
49,The_Celluloid_Sage,Accurate title at least...not much else to say about this rubbish,5,6 April 2020,"Another who's who movie involving lots of Adam Sandler's friends and his favourite returning actors. Now I'll be the first to admit that I cannot stand him or his films. By all accounts he's a decent person and I can't comment on that with any kind of authority, but usually his movies stink. But I guess you know what you're going to get with him. Thankfully, The Ridiculous 6 is slightly better fare than the usual tripe he rolls out.Tommy (Sandler) is a white man raised by the native Americans. Supernaturally quick and skilled, Tommy is due to marry his sweetheart Smoking Fox (yes really). While in camp, Tommy's father (Nolte) arrives to offer peace and ill-gained money to the tribe before it's too late. While there he is seemingly kidnapped by the evil Cicero (a hammy Danny Trejo) and carried off by his gang to obtain the money they believe is rightfully theirs. Tommy despite reservations, sets out to help his dear old pa.It is from here that Tommy begins to understand that his father was quite the philanderer back in his day. He encounters half-brother after brother as he (and then them) come up with ways of finding fifty thousand dollars in order to stop Cicero putting a bullet into their dad. Now unusually (from the Sandler films I have seen) the toilet humour seems to have been kept to a minimum. I'm thankful of that. While I appreciate everyone finds different things funny, I personally grew out of that being funny by my early teens. When it's done properly it can be funny though. Each to their own I guess. Sandler has made a career out of it, so maybe I'm in the minority.Anyway, the brothers are an eclectic mix of weird, wonderful and plain downright odd. Crews, Garcia and Wilson all act well enough but don't have a huge amount to do. The film shines in my opinion due to Schneider and Lautner. I've never really been a fan of Lautner either but he really does excel at playing stupid it seems. Schneider as the Mexican half-brother is also a big highlight. Even Harvey Keitel and Buscemi have fun in their small roles. And this ultimately is what elevates this over other Sandler movies. The cast. Had this been a pure Sandler effort I'm sure this review would have been very different.Ultimately though, the film tries to be too many things. While it is certainly enjoyable it's by no means good. Yes there are a couple of genuinely funny laugh out loud moments, most of the comedy is relatively flat and predictable. And while the title and artwork certainly suggests a parody of Tarantino's Hateful eight and the upcoming (at the time) Magnificent Seven remake (review to come), it actually seemed to me to parody Blazing Saddles more than any of them (which is one of the greatest comedies ever made). Which is funny given that Saddles is a parody film in itself. This wasn't helped by the fact that Nick Swardson tries to to be too much like Slim Pickens and Saginaw Grant (an actual real native American Chief) tries to be far too much like Mel Brooks actual parody of a native American chief. I'm sure there's some irony there somewhere.The film is actually quite well shot if not directed and for the most part everyone plays their part well. The inclusions of friends like Vanilla Ice (try and spot him) and wife Jackie seem forced rather than natural, but I have noticed Sandler tends to draft a lot of his buddies into numerous different films of his. Overall something better than he usually churns out, but still not great. Oh, and I can't wait to see more work from the donkey, who was the real star of the movie.

50,tjgoalie13,The Ridiculous Waste of Time,2,11 December 2015,"Adam Sandler's straight-to-Netflix film, The Ridiculous 6, represents an even larger fall from grace for the once successful comedian. After seeing the train wrecks that were Grown Ups 2, and That's My Boy I figured Sandler couldn't stoop any lower, I was wrong. The Ridiculous 6 is unfunny, terribly acted, overly silly, dumb, and truly terrible in almost all facets. It seems sad because Sandler is talented, but if he continues making films like this, he can't maintain an audience. Adam Sandler has become increasingly lazy over the last few years, but this film goes beyond that. Ridiculous 6 features an odd type of humor, which is a combination of dumb, silly, and racist. The humor is so stupid, it rarely registers as funny, but often feels like awkward moments of randomness. The film features a ton of cameos, most of them are distracting and not funny, except Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain. The humor was not only dumb, but it was exceedingly silly too. The film's acting is terrible, on every level. Sandler feels like he's mailing in his performance, while Taylor Lautner takes a giant step backwards as an actor. While Rob Schneider, Luke Wilson, and Terry Crewes manage to not come across as distractingly bad, almost every performance is awful. What doesn't help the acting is that the film has almost no story, terrible dialogue, and characters that are just racist stereotypes. It's sad looking at it, because many talented actors appear in the film, but they are all totally wasted. The story of Ridiculous 6 is more a bunch of random situations sloppily put together, built entirely on logical fallacies. Since the story is terribly constructed it feels bloated, and the film drags on. In retrospect the film is really about a half-hour too long. On top of that the film's villains are weak, and thus the film's conflict feels fake, and forced. Really when looking at closely it all comes down to the fact, that the film was lazily constructed. In conclusion The Ridiculous 6 represents a new low for Adam Sandler, who continues to get lazier, and lazier. The film is dumb, silly, racist, boring, not funny, and features a story that is so poorly written a 4 year old could have produced a better story. Hopefully, Sandler feels a negative backlash and finally takes some pride in his work, because he clearly has none now.",The Ridiculous 6
51,pepe4u22,cruel beyond description,1,21 January 2016,"may I start review with this caveat I could not watch this movie to the end as I was so repulsed. this alleged comedy was foisted upon us by Netflix who do make good shows well this must be a counter balance to it. the jokes were racist, stupid and mind numbing. as I saw some of the actors in the movie I thought how could people with talent like john tuturro and nick nolte be in this are they being blackmailed, if the us army wants to inflict true pain and suffering onto guantanimo bay internees have them watch this because this movie is so brutal. the plot is scattershot and just a set up for the silly sketches for the alleged comedians to do their skits but do not watch this with any thinking member of society",The Ridiculous 6
52,kdavies-69347,Ridiculously stupid.,4,3 January 2016,"The Ridiculous Six, brings a nice blend of the western genre and comedy from ""Waterboy"" director Frank Coraci. A lot of people seem to be hating on this film, but I thought it was a hilarious return to some classic comedic roots.Sandler stars and with him, he pulls in many of the former actors from previous Happy Madison productions in return. I was surprised at the number of cameo's and big name celebrities who have been busy with much bigger projects, and turned out for much smaller roles in this film! Trying to name all the different people in character was a blast, and I was surprised at how well some of them were hidden behind their costumes.The plot isn't difficult to follow, and although completely disjointed, makes sense for this comedic romp. The idea isn't to over-think things too much, and just enjoy the humor. There are a few crude moments that fall flat, and jokes that just didn't make me laugh at all, but they really have some great run on jokes throughout the film, and even from other movies from Sandler's repertoire. The only criticism I have is Taylor Lautner's performance which I just found more annoying than funny.So enjoy it for what it is, a silly little comedy brought to you by some of the biggest names in the business. It's no ""Blazing Saddles"" by any means.4/10",The Ridiculous 6

This is a completely satirical comedy that was a fun, light watch with a couple of friends while shut indoors. We decided to have a few drinks and try to forget everything that is going on for just a little while. Needless to say this movie fit the bill! Its up there with Mel Brooks and Monty Python as far as we were concerned. Much better than all the movie spoofs of the past 2 decades that are churned out by the bucket load.

This movie is very funny and comes close to my all time Sandler favorite, ""Happy Gilmore"". I have seen a lot of his films and this movie here takes second place in my book and ""Don't Mess with the Zohan"" comes in third.One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Adam and his five bros ride out in the desert and find the six one eye bad guys buried in the dirt up to their necks. One with ants all over his face, one with a crow pecking his head and one with a rattle snake, Steve Zahn.They beg Adam and his gang to dig them up. Adam says ""okay, we'll dig you up on one condition. They say, sure, anything, you name it, we'll do it. Adam then tells them to stop doing crime, and start doing good by people. Steve Zahn with the snake on his neck says ""I'd rather die."" The fat Black guy says ""Hell no, I ain't doing that.""

This one wasn't bad, however.If you don't like Sandler's comedy, then why would you watch this? It's a silly comedy with silly jokes (there are some poop/fart jokes, but it's not all like that), but my brother and I got some good laughs while watching this together. The baseball scene was pretty dumb, but the rest of the movie was decent.It's not Sandler's best, but not his worst at all. It was worth the watch, especially considering that it was ""free"" with a Netflix subscription.Bottom line, if you like Sandler's comedies, you'll like this. Just don't take it too seriously. It's better than most of his recent disappointing films.",The Ridiculous 6
56,alexcomputerkid,The Ridiculous 6 no doubt counts as another bad Adam Sandler film but he's hardly the only issue here.,2,23 December 2015,"Without a doubt, Adam Sandler's career is among the most interesting of any actors in the business. By popular choice, it's said by some that his earlier films like Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore was his prime. For me, Adam Sandler's odder and less talked about films like The Wedding Singer, The Cobbler and even the below average Men, Woman and Children are to my eye his more interesting works. When you have the awful comedies recently like the Grown Up's series or That's My Boy, it's fairly obvious that Sandler is now on a downward spiral of bad films that doesn't seem to stop. Even if only a Netflix film, the part- comedy/part-western The Ridiculous 6 is a dreadful film.Indian Tommy ""White Night"" Stockburn (Adam Sandler) never knew his real family until con-man named Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) shows up at his Indian Camp claiming to be his real father. After Frank Stockburn is kidnapped by Cicero (Danny Trejo), White Knight goes on the road to rescue his father. Along the way, White Night meets his five biological brothers who all also go on the rescue trip. The typical Western story involves money and some type of journey and of course all in the middle of a desert. The Ridiculous 6 no doubt counts as another bad Adam Sandler film but he's hardly the only issue here.You have an odd casting for the ""Ridiculous 6"" bunch of brothers. Rob Schneider as Ramon is the Mexican brother who literally can't stop talking about his burro. Jorge Garcia is Herm who can only talk gibberish due to his mom drinking and this is quite a waste of Garcia's talent. Terry Crews is piano player Chico and he is a totally forgettable character. Taylor Lautner is the strange Little Pete who's just too odd and I don't know why we like a character like this. Luke Wilson is Danny who's character's only plot-line is that at he's fault for letting Abraham Lincoln get assassinated and it servers no point to the plot whatsoever. Even Sandler plays his role very dryly and he doesn't seem to care much about this. The acting really is not bad and it's a start at least but these characters seems so off together and it is very uneven.Once you get past the main issues, the problems then go to the plot and the secondary characters. Again the talent is here in these secondary roles with actors like Danny Trejo, Steve Zahn, Will Forte, but the list goes on of wasted actors in more useless roles. This movie could go down in film history as a film with some of the most wasted talent. The plot itself is so basic for a Western and never goes anywhere new. The plot is also hamstrung sometimes and can't go anywhere because they try so hard to insert humor that it disrupts the plot. There is typical bathroom humor that you sometimes get in Sandler films but then you have some pretty dirty humor in this movie. When you combine bathroom humor and dirty jokes, who knows then who your main audience is? Kids wouldn't care about this and adults don't support Sandler like they once did.Even if the Western genre isn't as popular as it once was, better Westerns can be found than The Ridiculous 6. It is a highly forgettable movie with not a laugh or chuckle to be found. Unlike most Sandler films, this had some potential but at this point in his career, he never puts himself in with good material. Let's also not forgot the four film deal Sandler has with Netflix. Three more films for our viewing pleasure are coming up!",The Ridiculous 6
57,Eric266,"Stupid, but Oddly Entertaining",5,4 June 2018,"As my title suggests, this movie is stupid. However, its also got some hilarious bits that makes it worthwhile. You know what you're getting with Adam Sandler, so you shouldn't expect much...and I wasn't. Sandler is Tommy, a white man raised by Indians who finally meets his white father, Frank (a gravely voiced Nick Nolte), a former bank robber who is dying and just wants to reconnect. When his father is kidnapped by his former gang, Tommy decides to rescue him. Along the way he finds out he has five other half brothers by his father (the six of the title). That's about it for plot.The humor comes from some very well placed cameos and a couple of REALLY funny scenes. Taylor Lautner is a dim witted boob who has a strong neck. So he gets himself hung to distract the crowd while his brothers rob the town bank. The humor comes from Lautner swinging wildly from the noose like a pendulum, giggling the entire time as if he's on a playground swing. The second laugh out loud scene is Harvey Keitel as a saloon owner named Smiley who has a massive piece of gold. The boys steal it and just as Smiley catches them and is going to shoot them, he looses his head, literally. I couldn't stop laughing at his headless corpse shooting both guns while his still smiling head is lying in the foreground. Lastly, there is an ongoing gag about a gang of one eyed men called the ""Left Eye Gang"" who remove their own eye and keep them in a jar. Steve Zahn's character wants to join so he has to perform the initiation of removing his right eye. Its done in the shadow on a cave wall so there is no gore, but its pretty grotesque and funny at the same time.The cameos are also well done. I won't list them all, but you can read the credits to see who played what. Most of them were hits, with just a few misses. Some of them I didn't even recognize the actors until I saw the credits. They completely immersed themselves in the roles.The movie is definitely not up there with Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. But its not as bad as Jack and Jill. I really enjoy these actors and seeing them all having a good time was infectious.Give it a whirl.",The Ridiculous 6
58,fullheadofsteam,Funny enough for a Saturday matinée at home,6,13 August 2016,"This is certainly not Sandler's best, but despite some other reviews appearing on these IMDb pages, not his worst.

The rest of the humor is goofy and mostly good-natured, with only about 3 scenes of a violent nature as wink to Tarantino -- after all, the movie title is a take-off of Tarantino's (awful) The Hateful Eight. So just sit back, relax and let yourself enjoy an easy light entertainment, try to pick up on some of the nuanced joke references, and especially appreciate the good comedic work of Steve Zahn, Jorge Garcia, and Harvey Keitel -- and enjoy the totally unexpected schtick, written in a Saturday Night Live style, about baseball.

People created this and people reviewed and marketed this, basically saying ""This is who we are""It was like it was written by a seven year old, in the seventies a time where Benny Hill was the in thing. Calling a Native American woman ""Never Wears Bra"" is both insulting to women and insulting to an already persecuted minority group.

61,allexand,Just when you think Adam Sandler can't sink any lower...,1,11 January 2016,"""Ridiculous"" is a good word for this movie, though I doubt it's in the way Sandler intended. When your movie features two actors from the ""Twilight"" franchise, Rob Schneider as a Mexican and Sandler's nephew in a major role, things can only go downhill from there.The biggest problem with the film is Sandler himself, in that he seems incapable of learning from his mistakes. Ridiculous 6 has most of the flaws of Sandler's recent works: a main character who is beloved despite being incredibly annoying (That's My Boy, Jack and Jill), a main character who is an expert at everything (Pixels, Mr Deeds), Sandler being paired with an impossibly beautiful woman (Grown Ups, Just Go With It, Pixels, Chuck and Larry) and stunt casting of friends and family members (every Sandler movie after about 2002). The only ones he missed were incorporating a lavish vacation into the plot and rampant product placement. Though if this movie had gotten a proper theater release I suspect he would've worked those in too.The movie is so low budget that product placement might've ironically helped. The opening scene of Sandler using superhuman speed to defeat a gang of outlaws manages to be both laughable and creepy. The title card struck me as not only cheap-looking but difficult to read. The same outlaws are later menaced by some of the phoniest looking ants and snakes you will ever see this side of an XBOX game. Sandler's character discovers the final plot twist by studying an ""aged"" photo that is not even remotely believable due to some of the worst Photoshopping ever in a professional film. The climax takes place in complete darkness so that you won't know what's happening, not that you'll really care.Plot for a Sandler movie has always been threadbare but never more so than here. Sandler's character is raised by Native Americans but finally gets to meet his birth father just in time for him to be kidnapped. From there he goes on a journey to rescue him and meets five other illegitimate children that his father sired, not that this matters because it's all just a backdrop for bad jokes, bad physical comedy, and stunts and bad special effects to show the audience how awesome Sandler's character is. He always saves the day and manages to convince an outlaw gang to see the error of their ways after talking to them for all of two minutes. There's a twist at the end involving the kidnapping but Sandler doesn't care much about it so why should we?Offensive stereotypes abound with each new character with Rob Schneider and Taylor Lautner being the worst. Then there are the pretty bad native stereotypes, who have been reduced to lame jokes about their names, such as ""Wears-No-Bra"" and ""Smoking Fox."" Sandler's character has a gorgeous native wife who exists only to be abducted or threatened constantly. Other female characters are either tramps or fodder for one-liners. Though I do have to say that I am surprised the Native American extras walked off this film. While I can understand them taking offense, I also have to wonder if they noticed they were working for Adam Sandler.This is Sandler's grossest movie yet, and that's saying something. We are treated to a recurring gag of a donkey with explosive diarrhea, a scene where Steve Buscemi rubs his crotch and sticks his finger up said donkey's butt and then proceeds to stick his hand in someone's mouth, a scene of someone being beheaded, and a gory scene where a man cuts out his own eyeball complete with it dangling out by its nerves. Mercifully the last one is filmed in shadow.Perhaps the most troubling aspect of all about this film is seeing competent actors like Nick Nolte, Harvey Keitel, Danny Trejo and Luke Wilson involved with this. Though Trejo, Nolte and Wilson get off rather easy, Keitel is thoroughly humiliated in an unnecessary role as a saloon owner and gets his head lopped off for his troubles.On the other side of the spectrum, the worst performances come from Taylor Lautner, Jorge Garcia, Sandler himself and Vanilla Ice. Lautner makes an effort but manages to be more annoying than Sandler or Rob Schneider. Garcia is reduced to making indechiperable grunts, and Vanilla Ice, while managing to be one of the few saving graces of ""That's My Boy,"" was instructed to play Mark Twain, given unfunny slang and was made up to look more like a Madame Tussaud figure of Mark Twain than the real thing. Sandler doesn't care and this time it's obvious. There's also a weird cameo from country singer Blake Shelton, and while he's so-so, you can't help but wonder why he thought this was a good movie to launch an acting career.After such a long tirade, you may wonder, ""Was anything good about this movie?"" Well, the score and the scenery were actually decent.All I can say is that after a movie like this, Sandler really needs to get his act together or he could find himself in fisticuffs with the latest Real Housewife on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" before long. It's either that or pray that the ""Hotel Transylvania"" movies keep making money.",The Ridiculous 6

The beginning of the movie started off ... well, stupid. I did not let that bring me down, and stuck it out for the rest of the movie. Good thing too, because the jokes got funnier as the movie went on. From a cast where I personally expect pretty low performances from (David Spade, Rob Schneider, Luke Wilson, Nick Nolte, John Lovitz, even Vanilla Ice), they all were actually pretty amazing. The movie is not only funny, but it has heart as well. I was not expecting to actually feel something for any of these characters, but by the end of the movie, I had. Definitely a higher point in Mr. Sandlers latter career.",The Ridiculous 6
64,cablooie,1* (awful) is outrageously hi a rating for this,1,21 December 2015,"After watching this movie I roamed about for a few hours in dismay, trying to recall the name of the reviewer who had given it credit of some kind... I used to have a clear generic idea about what an awful film is. This one actually sets new standards. No words are to be found in the dictionary to give justice to how bad this insult of a movie is. I am still asking myself why on earth they have used a budget of any kind to produce a movie out of such an awful script. It felt like a 2 min spoof sketch of gross comedy stretched into 2 hours simply by repeating the same stuff over and over again. A mule with the runs? Really? It felt old and uncool the first time already, did it have to become a running gag filling half of the whole movie?Don't get me wrong, it doesn't always have to be smart or intelligent to be funny, loads of good comedies are plain silly and still make you laugh. Not this one. The movie was just pointless.Do not watch this, you will regret it and want your time back.40% = low rated 3rd hand awkward huh-gags about crap for silly 5yo kids. (Better else, the cheesiest fart/crap-related gags out there are ways funnier than this dough.)50% = yawns.5% = cameos.5% = great job by Nick Nolte, as always. Useless, unluckily. The film still sucks.Try any other experience, and I do mean anything: eat junk food until you puke, steal your own car and drive it in a ditch, bitchslap a kung fu expert, throw random bugs in your own underwear drawers.the idea of stealing your own car actually sounds like great fun compared to this movie, take my very word.",The Ridiculous 6

There, I said it. Recently, he's been a bit off-form, but this movie marks a return to form. It has a great cast, with all the old Sandler buddies popping up and we get some great cameos from other stars of film and music.The jokes are mostly big hits. The scenery is stunning. The music rolls along nicely. John Turturro almost steals the movie with his turn as Abner Doubleday. His scenes are just hilarious, especially for fans of baseball (I'll say no more on that to avoid a spoiler!). Lautner sends himself up hilariously. Rob Schneider and his burro are excellent. Terry Crews, Luke Wilson and Jorge Garcia are also excellent. They form the Ridiculous 6.Will Forte, Steve Zahn, Danny Trejo, Nick Nolte and the there baddies play their roles hilariously. Blake Shelton's Wyatt Earp, along with Jon Lovitz, David Spade and Vanilla Ice form a crazy poker crew.Seriously, do not bother reading the reviews or paying any attention to the score here (4.9 as i write this), just watch the movie.

Much of the same kind of humor in both movies. The premise is of course ridiculous, the acting ridiculous, the action is ridiculous, that is kind of the point. It's just good fun. It's what happens when you get a lot of veteran actors together and let them go wild.It was fun seeing many of these actors in the same movie. Even if some were just making cameos. Reminds me a lot of Mel Brooks but with a 2000s flair and references.I have run out of things to say but the line checker nazi robot from hell has deemed my review too short.

Absolutely gobsmacked.Instead of writing a review of this garbage, I'll simply present a number of seemingly unanswerable questions that came to mind while attempting to watch this abomination.How does Sandler continue to work in the movie industry?What type of lunatic agrees to finance this type of cinematic abortion?How does Sandler continue to recruit other ""professional"" actors to perform in his crap-o-ramas?Wasn't Taylor Lautner banned from ever doing movies again after that Twilight bullshit?Why is a donkey/burro with diarrhea funny?Why would the writers think that a 70-something Old West prostitute describing how she would have sex while doing a handstand be funny?Did Harvey Keitel really think this would be a good professional choice for his career this late in his life?Hasn't Steve Zahn debased himself enough after doing the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series?Did Sandler think that Native Indians would find it funny by calling a female character Never Wears Bra?Did anyone consider the idea of having a group of clearly non-Native Indians dance around and chant ""Hi-ya, Hi-ya, Hi-ya""?Finally, did anyone other than say the film editor, actually watch this horsecrap all the way until the end?",The Ridiculous 6
70,oprlvr33,Wonderfully parodic Sandler film,9,1 January 2016,"In spite what the Haters have scratched about this one, we enjoyed it immensely. For a change, Sandler delivers the goods, as compared to his last 2 or 3 bombs. Some critics have pined that he committed holy racism and sacrilege with this one. Not likely. What Sandler did, was take a few classic Western comedies like Blazing Saddles, A Million Ways to Die in the West and City Slickers, and switched things up a bit, adding even more satire to this mix than normal. Similar to Three Amigos, Sandler set up some good travel- action shots and face-off sequences which almost upstage that, of the classic Lorne Michaels film. And like Eastwood, Sandler once again cast his leading comic-actor friends in some very interesting and decent roles, including Steve Buscemi as a hilarious town barber/doctor. But you expect this from Sandler. And it usually works. And I personally never thought Rob Schneider could act, until Deuce Bigelow. And here, he is believable and funny, as a low- key sardonic Spaniard. Now Sandler hasn't experienced the greatest filmmaking choices over the last few years. But this one has truly redeemed his talent. The sets are cinematically good, the action decent, and the sight gags and jokes nicely delivered. And what an interesting twist, seeing Twilight hunk Taylor Lautner in a comedic role as a half wit.",The Ridiculous 6
71,dimbost,Sandler's best film in recent times!!,5,14 December 2015,"This was surprisingly a some what entertaining film from Adam Sandler. Coming off his Grown ups 2 and Jack and Jill (his writing and producing films) this was much better film. granted that the screenplay credit is shared with Tim Herlihy.The film has all of the usual nonsense that you would expect to find in a Sandler film, but still manages to have more then a few decent laughs. The twist is not really a twist, the story isn't much of a story and acting isn't much of... you get the picture. But the film does uses all of these mishaps to its advantage and throws at you the light hearten humor and makes fun of its self. Each of the actors brings in something different and makes it his own. Although to no surprise Sandler like in all of his films is more super human then superman!.. but thats just him and if you've seen his films, you are use to it.Acting in the film was pretty decent, Wolf boy from Twilight films plays himself (i haven't seen twilight or anything with wolf boy in it, so cant really judge him) but seen him being stupid and mentally handicapped for the film was extremely funny!! Terry Crews plays a pretty funny piano playing half brother from another mother to Sandler. good to see that Rob is back in Sandler's films as well.There isn't much to write more about the film without spoiling it. Sandler makes a parody of western films has a bunch of references to the genre and at the same time makes fun of himself. This would have a better choice to make in a bigger budget with cinema release then Jack and Jill. The story is pretty simple, Sandler grows up an orphan living with the Indians not knowing who his father is, when he shows up and gets taken by his old gang. It is up to Sandler to go and rescue him, where along the way he just keeps on bumping into his half brothers. I feel like Sandler can make more of these films, and can just keep on adding more half brothers to the mix for diversity.",The Ridiculous 6

I like many of his movies also the more realistic and dramatic roles, but with the comedies it has come down to silly and strange characters that are just acting out on camera, sometimes it seems like they get to improvise and if it is silly enough they use it in the film.The Ridiculous 6 is an atrocious film, but atrocious in an unsurprising way, frankly. It's a satire on American Westerns, which, in the present, need to look to Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West as some kind of contemporary benchmark of quality, something that says a lot in itself. The film is a tireless array of physical sight gags and gross out comedy hemmed by some huge names in the industry ostensibly doing their best to be the most insufferable screen presences of the year.",The Ridiculous 6

I will say this. It did make me laugh. It very much reminded me of a Mel Brooks movie. When I first watched Hogh Anexiety a few years ago, I thought it was amazing. I told myself that I wanted to write movies like that. But, I convinced myself that movie like that were no longer made. Turns out they are. An Oscar film, this is not. But, it is dumb humor. It made me laugh a lot. From the three of his films I have watched, this would be ranked three on my list. But, from watching his movies, I am so excited to see the one coming out in a week.

In a Bad Way,3,17 December 2015,"No one should go into this movie thinking there will be much of a story line or anything cinematically great with this movie, just as I did. I really just wanted some cheap laughs and some dumb humor that I have grown accustom to with Adam Sandler movies. This is a story of 6 people who find out they are all brothers in their quest to save their thief of a dad. Should be a set up for some light humor right? Wrong.First, for the positives. I did get a few chuckles out of this movie. The actors are all the same ones you usually see in movies like this, and they know how to get some laughs. The movie is full of physical humor and I am sure a lot of people will enjoy the dumb situational humor throughout the movie.For the bad, In my opinion, a lot of the jokes and situational humor was poorly executed. The characters were so over the top that I spent more time laughing at how bad the characters actually were, instead of laughing at the jokes. Adam Sandler tried his best at keeping a straight face and take a serious take at humor, but its just not his style. He should never pretend to be serious; its just uncomfortable to watch. Looking at the cast, the movie should have been a lot better executed on the comedy end. Insteady, the scenes seemed random, uncomfortable, and hard to watch. There were very few scenes where i genuinely laughed at the material.All I wanted was to see a movie that I could get some cheap laughs from. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece or anything special out of this, but I was still disappointed. Do yourself a favor, save yourself the time and don't see this movie.",The Ridiculous 6

80,jsmith98-1,One Of Those Movies You Must Have A Sense Of Humor To Enjoy!,9,20 May 2020,I am not going to give any spoilers away in this review. It is just a funny movie unless you are a Politically Correct type of person. I am not a huge fan of Adam Sandler and a couple of other actors in this movie however after I got into this movie I was laughing so hard I felt intoxicated. It is full of stereotypes that are now inappropriate for the masses and it just shows how much our attitudes have been changed for the worse as we have become too sensitive about EVERYTHING!We have watched this six or seven times and it never seems to get old. I think it is a terrible environment we are currently living in with everyone being offended by stereotypes. If you cannot laugh at yourself you should not laugh at others and probably should not watch this movie. One reviewer compares this to Western Saddles which is an incredible Iconic Movie that is far worse As far a stereotypes and words that are considered far more inappropriate than this film. It has similar satire but Western Saddles is a classic movie that you might have a hard time watching in our modern day overly sensitive world. Luckily we have a couple of copies of Western Saddles.I agree that there is nothing funny about slavery or slurs towards other nationalities that are depicted in this film. As a gay man I hear this kind of crap all the time and people find it hilarious. Does it bother me? Absolutely not. I am generally laughing just as hard as others are. We need to treat each other like equals but there is no reason why we cannot laugh at our own selves as we all have a sense of humor and we should not forget the plight of others but we should not have to be so sensitive about everything that is not politically correct either! I guess what I am trying to say is that we should be past the hatred of others who are different and come from different countries as we are all basically the same. Human beings. Just because we laugh at things that might be considered inappropriate for some should not be taken so seriously. We mostly have progressed from that terrible period in time and if we let it hold us back we will never get any further in our short lives or have equality for all. I think being a comic or a comedian is probably the hardest job that anyone in the entertainment industry could pursue.,The Ridiculous 6

There are some really funny moments in this one, and a simple storyline to follow. I watched this while bored on a random Tuesday night and was engaged throughout. It's just an enjoyable movie.I can't shake one feeling though. This movie has some excellent cinematography, a good soundtrack and some very good actors. I just wonder whether using all those resources with the budget, while trying to make a serious movie, could have produced a decent western? I guess we'll never know.",The Ridiculous 6

I love movie mashups where they bring in so many actors that the happy madison crew tends to roll with, as well as a few new additions. I can't find a single flaw with this, and I love to be critical. It really is ridiculous, and I wouldn't want it any other way.

More recently, Quentin Tarantino gave us The Hateful 8. As everyone knows, The Three Musketeers (some 25 film versions, of which Fred Niblo's 1921, Alan Dwan's 1939, George Sydney's 1948 and Richard Lester's 1973 are the MacMahonianest) were 4, John Ford gave us Two Rode Together (1962) and Lazlo Benedek The Wild One (1953). I don't know what happened to 9 and 10 (Blake Edwards, 1979) and The Ten Commandments (Cecil B de Mille, 1923 and 1958) don't really count, for this purpose. But anyway, now we do have 6. It's ridiculous.The Ridiculous 6 was the 9th feature film directed by Frank Coraci, director of 2nd to 3d rate light comedies et pour cause frequently behind the camera in Adam Sandler vehicles.The Ridiculous 6 tells the story of the eponymous, offspring sired by ageing bank robber Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte, in autopilot) from 6 different mothers and consisting of a former Abraham Lincoln bodyguard who needed to go to the bathroom for a moment while in the theatre with Abe, in the course of which digression he actually gave directions to Abe's theatre booth to John Wilkes Booth, thus nursing a guilt complex the size of US history (Luke Wilson), a round-faced droopy mustachioed sombreroed half-Mexican (Rob Schneider), a Neanderthal fur-catcher (Jorge Garcia), a somewhat incongruous hillbilly dimwit (Taylor Lautner), a black man (Terry Crews) and Adam Sandler. The ridiculous are on a quest to procure 50.000 USD to pay off dad's robbing debts, thus embarking in a series of low-brow comedic endeavours and accidents.The history of the moronic western comedy, at least of the deliberate variety, goes back at least to the Three Stooges (Goofs and Saddles, Del Lord, 1936), or, if one wants to stick to feature length efforts, to Abbot and Costello (Ride 'em Cowboy, Arthur Lubin, 1942). But long doesn't mean illustrious, and The Ridiculous 6 gives the impression of not even trying to escape the curse.

Which is somewhat interesting, considering what a low rating it has on Netflix. The hate this movie has garnered for itself is certainly palpable, it seems all of Adam Sandler's projects have suffered low ratings as a result (admittedly, I haven't seen his other projects, they might just be as terrible as this one.) I would like to get out of the way it's my understanding that no one who (intelligently) walked off this set, ended up in the final product. I'm pretty taken aback by the Apache portrayal in this flick, I remember thinking, ""if those were real back-in-the-day Apaches, everyone near them would be DEAD."" But onto the fact that this movie has nothing going for it save an attempt to weave a lot of story- lines that just unravel. As an attempt at Blazing Saddles, this is just terribly puerile due to the pacing alone. you're inundated with sight gag after offensive dialogue after juvenile quip. It's like they tried to cram every little idea they could as quickly as possible in order to get something to land as funny. Thousands of attempts just weren't. I got to say, Adam Sandler just doesn't seem to have it anymore, and a movie like this, just goes to show when you come from a less scrutinized era such as the 90's, you aren't really gonna land on your feet as well as you used to. But at least landing in the first place should've showed you how to do it right.",The Ridiculous 6

95,Krissz,Not as bad as it could be and sure not as fun as it wants to be,4,11 December 2015,"Well first off, I don't like Adam Sandler movies...or rather: most of his movies are pretty dumb and a few are descent comedies. With Ridiculous 6 he has made a rather weird thing. It is both an almost good movie and really horrible. The big problem for this movie is that it is supposed to be a comedy. A classic Adam Sandler Comedy with his trusted friend Rob Schneider (a person i have always hated), farts and a bunch of weird characters. See, I don't find this movie very funny! Yes it has its moments and it has some great characters (more on that) but all in all I didn't find it funny. Most of the beginning I was thinking of just see something else because the jokes was just poorly delivered or just to weird and unfunny. That whole eye-joke was just disgusting! I could not see the point in that joke and the same with the shitting Burro. Is a donkey with diarrhea really a good place to start your movie? Further it lacked any sort of motivation for the characters. Yes they hear about their dad...but meeting a guy that out of the blue Tells you he is your brother and he wants to help your dad by robbing people, is that motivation enough? OF COURSE NOT! These brothers could have been e.g. hurt by Frank e.g. If he had shot Chicos finger off so he was a bad piano-player or that he was responsible for Herms lack of speech. This would make them have a grudge against him and a reason why they would find him themselves to settle the score when Tommy showed up. It feels a bit undeveloped and makes the first half rather bad.This is actually the bad things i have to say about the movie. The rest is actually good.The movie is, in some way, a descent western. Surprisingly enough it works better off when not trying to be funny and let the characters act as if they were in a western rather than a comedy. The story works, despite the lack of motivation, and gets to be just as every other western. When they begin their heist and the bad guys chase after them the movie feels more serious and less as a comedy. it sounds stupid, but It is not trying too hard to be funny, it actually gets to be funny when it just lets the story play out. Steve Buchemi and Vanilla Ice makes some great cameos. They get to play their roles perfectly and gets just enough space to make the scenes funny. These great cameos gets to play out their scenes with no real interruption by fart jokes or other horrible things and it actually helps making Rob Schneider likable and, do I dare say it, funny at times! This is actually why I like the movie in the end. despite its problem with being weird and unfunny in the first half, it ends with being more of a western and a bit more serious. I heard someone mention that Sandler tried to make this movie for about ten years. This could be the reason why it is not a typical Sandler comedy. It seems like a combination of projects as he was split between making a total comedy like Seths ""A Million Ways To Die In The West"" and a spoof of Tarantinos upcoming ""The Hateful Eight"" but mixed them together because of constant rewriting.So all in all it actually ends at 4. Not as fun as it wants to be but not as bad as it could be.",The Ridiculous 6

The only good thing about this movie to me is Taylor Lautner's character, got many laughs out of his lines because he's so silly. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but it's really not all that bad as people are saying it is. It actually seems a little tame compared to other Adam Sandler films.

Some parts of the film were ridiculous, but hey, it's in the title.I was very surprised, as I find some Adam Sandler films to be pretty stupid.Some reviews seem to be quite harsh on the stereotypes used, but stories and life are both boring without them. Everyone stereotypes everyone, and it's entertaining to see it highlighted by others or by stories and films - no matter what you profess externally.You could even say the stereotypes were subverted to an extent: The hick had some poignant thoughts and ideas, the Indians weren't drunkards and had some modern ideals, the black was creative and worked, the women were 'strong', the white men were baddies.I suggest not getting caught up in political correctness to the point of illness, and just watch this film as an independent piece of art/entertainment, instead of feeling compelled to judge it badly out of obligation or guilt.

It's just silly, slap-stick comedy. A typical Happy-Madison film. And it has all the usual players that Adam Sandler usually includes in his movies. Taylor Lautner is too funny, I was very impressed at how silly he was. Rob Schneider is as incredible as ever. There were many parts where I just sat there with my jaw dropped, saying ""I can't believe they went there!"", in regards to the jokes.

105,Javin,It's precisely what you should expect from a Happy Madison production.,10,18 December 2015,"Warning: A few minor spoilers.Happy Madison started moving into the ""feel good"" family films with Mr. Deeds, Click, and the like, but has gone back to its roots with ""The Ridiculous 6"". From the fight in the opening scene you immediately know that this movie is not going to take itself seriously. It wasn't what I would consider some of Adam Sandler's ""best work"" but it's up there with Waterboy in my book, and I'd watch it again. Which is odd, because the campy/goofy stuff was a little heavy handed in the beginning, and I even told my wife I'd be okay if she wanted to turn it off. She said we had to muscle through it to see Taylor Lautner's character (she was a huge fan of him as Jacob in Twilight). And Oh My God am I glad we did. From the moment he enters the scene, Lautner shows a side of him that is simultaneously hilarious and cringe-worthy. Time and time again he had some of the best one-liners and there's one scene (no, not the Burro scene) where I actually guffawed out loud, and we even had to rewind it to watch again after finishing the movie. You'll know it when you see it. It was awesome seeing this side of him, and realizing what a range he has as an actor. After this performance, I sincerely hope that Lautner becomes a regular part of the Happy Madison family. Almost as surprising was Jorge Garcia's character (""Hurley"" from Lost). I almost didn't recognize him, and he shows his chops as a comic actor with only a single intelligible word in the entire movie. Don't come into this looking for a deep plot line, or anything other than what you would expect from a campy Happy Madison production. Think more ""Little Nicky"" and less ""Grandma's Boy"". Still a great watch, if only to see Lautner's character with your wife. Especially if she loved Twilight.",The Ridiculous 6
106,cmtrisket,"Adam Sandler-esk, Per Usual",5,18 July 2017,"Lets see, where to start with this one! Right off the bat I can tell you that it is a typical Adam Sandler movie. If you like the others, you will find this one appealing. If you don't like his other movies you will probably hate this movie.Lets talk specifics. The Netflix Original movie is 1 hour and 59 minutes (119 minutes) long. The time frame is decent and if you are into the movie it will fly by. This movie is one of the most well known actor, jammed packed as they come. You can sit on IMDb.com and scroll for a while and still see names you recognize. I'm not sure this movie paid well for anyone, but was more of a fun project. On top of the already mentioned leads you have names like: Will Forte, Steve Zahn, Nick Nolte, Jon Lovitz, David Spade, Danny Trejo, Nick Swardson, Blake Shelton, and Vanilla Ice. Honestly that list keeps going, its incredible how many people they got to be in this movie.As we look to the plot, you quickly realize, like most of his movies it is loose and only there as a basic structure. To sum it up Tommy (Adam Sandler) is an orphan raised by Native Americans. His dad comes back and then gets taken. The rest of the movie is about him and his newly found five brothers trying to rescue their dad. Again, the movie is really more about the cast and how they interact with each other.The humor in the movie is 'stupid' and 'childish', and that isn't meant in a mean/bashing way. It, at times, is very inappropriate and brash. Other times it is just corny, and you wonder how these movie keep getting funded at all. That being said if you like that sort of humor even a little bit, you will laugh. I'll be the first to admit that these movies are a nice getaway from everyday life. It is nice to be able to watch a movie and not have to worry about following it too closely. I do like 'stupid' humor and I laughed a lot.It is as random as they come and to see all of these people play parts you never thought they would, it's pretty amazing.But, when you turn to the aspect of scoring/rating a movie like this they are always low. Scoring is serious and movies that aren't taken too seriously on purpose, know they will be ranked low before they even start. As for being a comedy, yes but not well thought out comedy. As for western..it takes part in the West, but that's about it. Again it's loose, the themes of a western aren't there but the costumes and what not are. Take it with a grain of salt.In summary, I laughed. The plot is basic. You never know which actor you will see next, and they all work great together in weird roles. It is your typical Sandler movie and should be treated as such. If I had a choice of never seeing it in the first place or watching it twice, I would watch it again.That being said movies like this fall flat in the ratings and I would personally give this movie a 4.5/10",The Ridiculous 6

Sony, Paramount & Warner Bros. all passed on it, Problems with Native American extra's walking off the set and Adam's recent flops made the film hard to sell and it was eventually basically given over to Netflix as part 1 of Sandler's four film contractual obligation with the streaming giant. ..Gotta say, it really wasn't good. There are moments where the movie succeeds however, most of the gags are telegraphed worse than a Rhonda Rousey straight right. I'll admit it has a huge cast of comedians and known actors that are fun to watch but, sadly, it quickly becomes a bad SNL skit that somehow drags in to 2 hour territory.

I always feels so sorry for the actors that make it into a movie with Mr Sandler because they'll probably not be remembered no matter how good they pull off their part.Sandler should really pick his parts more carefully.

Okay, the majority of the cast are known for their cringe-worthy comedies anyway but this isn't even cringe-worthy, it's just...boring.The saving grace is a short fight scene with some impressive camera angles (Luke Wilson getting beat up in a bar and manages not to spill his drink) and (an absolutely pointless and shoe-horned) scene where a newly invented game of baseball is played, This scene made me smile considering the first person ever inventing a sport, creating new rules on the spot whilst playing against opponents.The plot is predictable, the CGI is below average, the comedy isn't there - genuinely think I only grinned at ONE point because I like Steve Zahn - and why does Rob Schneider look stoned the entire duration of the film?!Don't waste your time.

111,argento6,As bad for a brain as early reality TV,2,22 June 2016,"One star is even a generous rating! Frank Coraci, still the best comic director that worked with Sandler in my opinion gives us one of his first lazy effort, surrounded by lazy actors and comedians. No matter how stereotyped are the characters and the jokes, nothing's funny. except for the burro.Frank Coraci married The Panavision years ago with the excellent football spoof The Waterboy (8/10). Sandler might not have been at his best back then, but thank god we had Kathy Bates (Mamma) and Fairuza Balk (Vicky). The 2 women played with such energy that the use of the larger image format easily made them stand out, but felt quite unusual and out of place for such a film. Perhaps Coraci and Sandler had seen the beautiful shots of Balk in The Craft or Gas, food, lodging... Still she's about 100 pounds? How does one takes as much space as Bates and Sandler (The 2's accent was awful.) with that shape? She ended up in a little box, thanks Frank, you might have large image but lack dept dear. But who cares if Sandler gets in the background when it's intentional?The ridiculous 6 is no different. Sandler, in the back seat looks as his pals deliver the so called comedy and all he does is throw a line of encouragement once in a while. Rob Schneider's voice as a Mexican sounds like it was dubbed, as for every other character, all equally dumb and uninteresting. David Spade, with only one scene fairs the better (That says it all, no?) The problem is, we have no Barrymore, Bates, Balk, Walken or Nicholson here. The worst of the former Saturday Night live comedians once again (Including Sandler). And add to this cameos by Nick Nolte, Harvey Keitel, John Torturo, but they struggle with little to nothing.

Not a full family comedy, since not all of the innuendos were appropriate for children. However, if you like Adam Sandler and his work, as well as not minding, mindless laughs and partly unscripted jokes, its a good way to enjoy an evening at home without having to put out too much thought or emotion, then go for it! It did have so many really great cameo actors, too ma y to mention here, and I just wanted to give a shout out to two of them that won me over the moment they stepped in front of the camera...naturals both of them. I loved Blake Shelton as an actor or they just picked the right guy for this character, Wyatt Urp, but I was surprisingly and happily shocked at how well he acts? I thought he was only a singer, song writer and general show moderator, besides being an all around nice guy! Great Job Shelton...I never knew you were as talented as you are! Sometimes, he says some things that seem a little off color, but he does it in a way that is non offensive and you can tell he is just being who he is, rather than pretending he is someone he is not. I saw that someone called him an idiot, but I think he is quite bright and plays it down, so that he can keep people around him comfortable. I do enjoy his sense of humor, so I think his character worked for this picture. I really also loved the work of Vanilla Ice with Mark Twain's Character! Seriously, this guy is so bright thinking on his feet and always so imaginative in all his roles. Some people just have it all in the creative right brain side and this guy does! He can do serious to funny to action and anything in between. I'm a little envious! My guess, Vanilla Ice, has other creative arts that he enjoys and participates in? Does anyone know more? If you think about how, in real life, Mark Twain's imagination must have been so free and wild, as well as his humorous quotes, you really can see Vanilla Ice throwing down his hilarious side with the Mark Twain part. Both these men did a fine job, and I really just wanted to give kudos to just these two men, in particular. I did wonder why we missed a happy go lucky character in this film, that Sandler has played in his comedies, in the past, but who really knows how hard he must have worked to get all of these famous actors together, and then to bring out the best in each one of them, for each and every one of the character roles? I'm sure it's not easy being cheesy, all the time? Good job Shelton and Ice! I'd like to see more of Shelton on scene for the right roles, since he really did surprise and delight!??? MORE PLEASE? As for Ice, he is a staple already and we all know he will likely always have a fan base, plus more! Kudos to both of you!

Other movies of his such as Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and Bulletproof I find to be comedic gold. However, when it comes to some of his other comedies, that range from mediocre to being god awful! Mediocre ones being films such as Blended, Grown Ups 2, Sandy Wexler. God awful is stuff like The Do-Over, Jack and Jill (which I think is the worst film of the decade so far), and THIS! I hate the entire 119 minute run time of this movie! This movie is far too long, REALLY boring, and unfunny! 85-90 minutes would have been plenty long enough for this movie. Watching this movie for the first time in December 2015, around the 90 minute mark or so, I thought we were at the climax already, but I found out there was another 30 minutes to go! Not once did the comedy in this movie make me laugh. There is almost nothing more terrible than a comedy that doesn't make you laugh. The two good things that I can at least say about this movie is that not all the acting is terrible, and the action scenes can be somewhat entertaining at times. Other than that, this is easily one of the worst things Sandler has ever come out with. If you see it on Netflix, don't press play, you'll never get those 2 hours back.",The Ridiculous 6

The movie is so disgustingly racist I can't even believe it was released in 2015. Some memorable moments include a racial slur in just about every other sentence during the intro, Adam Sandler in red face, and various racist jokes, including calling a young native women ""Poca-hot-tits."" To be completely honest I had to turn it off part way through, I just couldn't get through it. After Sandler's movie ""Pixels,"" which has been reviewed as widely misogynist, I didn't think he could get any worse but it almost as if he is doing this on purpose. This film was actually so racist that multiple native American actors casted as extras walked off the set, saying they just couldn't do it. The film has also spurred a few online petitions asking that Netflix remove it from their website. And honestly, the movie still wouldn't even be good if it wasn't a racist mess. The jokes weren't good, the setting and plot was nothing special, there was absolutely nothing about this movie that could hold my interest. In fact, if it was possible I would rate this movie less than 1/10, but that's as low as IMDb allows.

When I was younger I loved old Adam Sandler movies, but he hasn't made anything decent in a while. The only reason that this movie appealed to me was that it was a western. Unfortunately the movie just doesn't work. There are a few actually funny moments, an excellent cast of cameos (but this is mainly just a distraction), and a tremendously thin storyline. I wasn't expecting art, but the story is actually central to the movie for parts and it is painfully bad. The comedy is stupid and juvenile, but that is expected. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, but too few to actually give the movie any flavor. The western motif was actually pushed hard in the soundtrack and the main character which Sandler plays as though he is pretending to be Clint Eastwood in the outsider man of few words role. But this is just useless in a comedy and the movie fails badly as an homage to westerns or as satire.I did not absolutely hate the movie, but wish I would have picked something else to watch.",The Ridiculous 6

It seems to me they are mostly having fun in front of the camera and that's a rare quality in comedy. All the acting was spot on, particularly Lautner, if we compared his werewolf role to his present character, he really nailed it. Watching Turturro's acting as the father of America's favorite sport made me laugh so hard; Buscemi's character was brilliant; the toilet humor was not excessive, but funny; the Spanglish used was neat, and one you appreciate more if you work with languages. In general, we have one good film to watch with family/friends and laugh out loud.

The plot for the movie is basically about an outlaw who discovers that he has 5 half-brothers, and together they go on a mission through the West, circa 1875, to find their wayward father. The brothers are Adam Sandler as ""Tommy"" aka ""White Knife"", Terry Crews as ""Chico"", Jorge Garcia as ""Herm"", Taylor Lautner as ""Lil Pete"", Rob Schneider as ""Ramon"", and Luke Wilson as ""Danny"". The rugged dead-beat and wayward father is portrayed by the always classy Nick Nolte. I really like the entire cast, but I was especially delighted by Steve Zahn as ""Clem"", and Rob Schneider as ""Ramon"". I liked the fact the ""The Ridiculous 6"" wasn't afraid to throw in off-the-wall scenarios. One scene in the movie that made me laugh until I cried, was the scene involving the brothers and the shoot-out at the Saloon with ""Smiley"".

Sure, this movie isn't winning any academy awards and haters are gonna hate, but sorry haters, Adam Sandler is laughing all the way to the bank with this one!! Netflix knew what they were doing when they signed a 4 picture deal with Mr. Sandler. I think the viewer has to appreciate Adam Sandler movies to understand where this comedy is coming from. ""The Ridiculous 6"" is around 2 hours long, but I felt the plot moved right along and didn't drag at any particular time. ""The Ridiculous 6"" is worthy of a PG-13 rating due to some adult humor.

The Ridiculous Six falls into the second category.Some Sandler movies are just flat out awful. But Ridiculous Six manages to be mildly amusing at times. It's impossible to buy Sandler as a bad-ass Indian tracker, but that's probably the point. You've probably never seen Taylor Lautner or Jorge Garcia like this before--but whereas Garcia is pretty funny as a mumbling moon-shine- making hillbilly, Lautner as a simpleton just gets grating after awhile. Also, somewhat surprisingly, the funniest guy out of the six is Rob Schneider, whose Mexican character manages to steal every scene he's in. Terry Crews and Luke Wilson are just there and don't really add much to the proceedings.The best parts of the movies are Will Forte's bumbling band of one-eyed bandits and the cameos--seriously, some of these cameos are just flat out awesome.

A lot of funny moments, and I like when comedies take place in a historical time period. I think Adam sander has been making better films to include pixel and others, and rob Schneider also fit in well to the film.

I didn't find anything wrong with this at all. I thought it moved well (for a 2 hr movie), and was a fun flick. I said ""FUN"" people...not supposed to be deep, thoughtful or life changing. If you enjoyed Happy Gilmore, this is very much the same humor and unfortunately many folks are just not ""quick enough"" to catch the implied innuendos. I didn't find it to be childish humor as many supposed blockbusters out there are. Could it have been better? I am not sure how...great cast, great sets, some story twists. Sure there is some eye-roll humor, and not overly heavy on belly laughs, but maybe all the negative viewers should move on to something a bit more dark and depressing to match their mood.

My teen son turned the movie off about ten or fifteen minutes later, calling it stupid. Unfortunate, because we normally enjoy stupid-funny movies.

Both of these types are stupid, offensive and awkward. The first type makes you laugh and when you try to calm down, you realize you were laughing because of something really not that funny and probably very awkward, which makes you laugh even more (Strange Wilderness, That's My Boy).Unfortunately, the second type makes you want to erase from your memory all the traces of how lame and boring that was and bury all the copies of that film in the bottom of the ocean, so nobody would ever make this horrible mistake of watching that film, like you just did.The Ridiculous 6 is according to me the worst scenario of the second type.

And then, out of no where, like an abusive boyfriend after swearing, for the 4th time, he'll never't hit you again, BAM! Herb, bro #4 showed up and rendered the film unwatchable! What is this, 1974? You're not Mel Broooks! This crap doesn't fly! Why Sandler? It could have been OK, it was going so well. It had a few decent things going for it. Taylor nearly derailed it. Then Herb finally did, for me at least. I mean.

The characters are all stereotypical of their race but rather than being funny it just came across as mildly racist. There were a couple of moments that raised a smile but the joke was then taken too far. The acting was flat and boring with none of the mediocre dialogue being delivered with any conviction. The almost cartoon like style of the action sequences could have worked very well but instead it felt forced and unfunny.I suppose if you've got nothing else to watch and you are in to toilet humour then maybe this is the film for you.

This movie will never be a classic, but it's worth watching and will probably end up being a cult classic. Also, I got a lot of respect for Taylor Lautner in this film.

I just have to say after seeing Taylor Lautner go from hot werewolf to bumpkin half wit western boy, was a total shocker, but also made me respect him soooooo much as an actor! Honestly, to be so diverse like that, and be able to SLAY such a role (team Little Pete!!!) he did an amazing job. He's the last person I would expect to play a character like that, but I love that he took it on and nailed it!! What a treat!! The hanging scene though, I about peed my pants! Lol. I personally love slap stick comedy and enjoy most Adam Sandler movies. This movie is silly and funny and has a super fun star studded cast. I loved Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain and Blake Shelton as Wyatt Earp. Terry Cruz was another one I absolutely adored in this movie, he is so freaking hilarious!! People who are giving bad reviews and claiming it's a racist film need to get their panties out of a wad and loosen up. I cannot believe how easily offended every gets these days. I'm Caucasian and I absolutely died laughing at the part where the Native American pokes fun at white people ... ""I like to eat potato chips and play with my chest hair."" LOLOLOL. Seriously, lighten up people, have some fun, it's just a movie!!!! You know, make believe? I thought it was well done, super hilarious, very well cast and I'd give it a 20 out of 10 if I could!

Sure, the plot is ridiculous, but at every turn and scene change, there's a different actor you know from somewhere making you laugh with a witty one liner or slapstick fall. Not to mention, it's chalked full of pop culture references, spoofs, and parodies. Plus, the scenery is gorgeous and actually shot in the US.Sure, it's not great or PC, but it's worth a try.Hint: Have the IMDb page open while you watch.

Attempts a humor are lame as are the allegories. Story is weak and contrived simply to force interaction. So much more could have been done with Nick Nolte's (who actually does a pretty good job) character.The one redeeming quality is the many guest stars - I kept watching through the whole movie simply to see who showed up.

However, Adam Sandler's performance was great and the others did a pretty decent job. I did find the donkey and the doctor's scene to be too gross. Similarly, some of the scenes were either too gross or forced. But overall the movie was definitely watchable. If you are Adam Sandler's fan, then you will certainly not DISLIKE it.

Lots and lots of fun. Yeah, maybe it's kind of big on being too post- modern. You need to understand westerns, especially the Italian ones, and like Clint Eastwood and Tarantino at the same time. And hopefully you have seen Blazing Saddles as well. Although I didn't think the Blazing Saddle references were as big as others are saying. But add in a dash of Monty Python and you are on your way to enjoying this one. It is absurd in many scenes and I think modern society has forgotten how funny absurd can be. Overall, I saw it more as a homage / parody of the great spaghetti westerns, and a humorous take on being politically correct in modern western society, with a sweet footnote that it will all work out all right if we stick together. Nice. And don't worry too much about Adam Sandler being in this. He doesn't dominate, and the movie is better than the man. As far as his acting goes this is probably his best movie. He does his best at being Clint Eastwood suddenly finding himself in ""Dancing with the Wolves."" Yeah, it is that kind of post-post-modern movie thing, but if you get it, it will be highly enjoyable and you'll get some great laughs as well.

This movie is clever, so pay attention.They did not take the easy way out by doing a parody of every western ever made, which would have been lame! This is originality, something that movies had lost, which is why the most original stuff is in television and cable series these days!Adam Sandler deserves props as one of the writers, this was unique, and with all of the big budget flops, we needed this!If you do not go into this movie expecting a Clint Eastwood western or Kurt Russell's Tombstone, you'll have a wonderful time and pass your Saturday night away with some laughs and plenty of surprises!The Ridiculous 6 is the Generation X version of Blazing Saddles!",The Ridiculous 6

In a perfect world Vanilla Ice would get a spin off movie for his Mark Twain character and do five sequels. Terry Crews was amazing as usual, and who knew he could play piano so well. This is the strongest comedic supporting cast for a Sandler movie ever. O Doyle RULES! Seriously, this is the comedy of the year. I feel this movie was done to tick off the critics and to make the fans happy. I can't wait to see the next movie Sandler does. The cinematography actually looked great.

192,joshuaDee,Adam Sandler doing Adam Sandler,6,11 December 2015,"I'll start by saying I grew up on Adam Sandler movies... I know some people don't care for his type of comedy or even some of his more dramatic roles. I cherished the 90's cult classics like Bily Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, etc. I liked Punch, Drunk, Love. I even shamefully liked Spanglish. I know, I know.I'm a generation X'er, which may or may not be relevant to my appreciation for Sandler. But his comedy was revolutionary at the time. It brought something different to the table. Slap-happy. Stupid. Whatever you want to call it. Albeit, dumb. It was different and unique.Now, the cast... Wow. You've got the supporting cast that made Sandler movies great. Rob Schneider, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, John Tuturro. They had some mildly funny jokes during the movie. Most of the jokes were ridiculous and just plain childish. But I think that's half the appeal of Happy Madison movies. The cameos were random. But in my opinion, really pulled the movie together. Watching Vanilla Ice play Mark Twain was entertaining and even surprisingly funny and spot on. I mean, he scarily resembled Mark Twain. Blake Shelton playing Wyatt Earp.. Not sure who's idea that was, but it was actually entertaining as well and I think kind of matched his personality. The plot was just okay. But really, what are we expecting? True Grit plot line? No, it's a comedy. Half the fun is the ride. The only thing I couldn't spin my head around was the fact that Adam Sandler didn't have many jokes. Seemed like everybody got the funny lines except Sandler. Unless the 'mystical' powers were all the jokes. In which case, I didn't find all too funny. After watching Pixels and Grown Up's 2, I've realized that Sandler's films are morely aimed at the younger kids now. I know I'm probably late to the party on that one, but I'm always hoping Sandler will reprise his somewhat crude humor. I even thought he was coming back to that with Funny People. I think that's just how Hollywood budgets and movies work. Financiers know people are going to pay money to watch Will Ferrell look like an ""in over his head"" dummy. Just like a Seth Rogen movie is going to have a lot of pot humor or Tyler Perry dressing up as a woman. People know what they're getting into before previewing. This may be why it's on Netflix.. Who knows, I don't. If you're looking for a goofy movie the family can watch with very minor swearing, an occasional motorboat, and some borderline racial epithets, then you should be safe. I will give it to the casting crew for actually hiring Native Americans to play Native American characters. Seems like that's still a real problem in Hollywood, surprisingly. Didn't seem as some folks would say, whitewashed. Sandler did have a super tan going on. But, that's probably apart of the character living amongst native tribes. Who knows, probably just making a bigger deal than it really is, like many people and organizations are doing these days. No need to boycott the movie or anything people! And although I did say there were minor racial blah blah blahs. The movie made a point to go after everybody(races). Get over it people! Cheese-zest! I find it funny that the folks complaining of racism in the movie and walked off set, walked back on a day later to finish shooting and collect their paycheck. Please people, stop trying to kill satires. Even if they're not that funny. I probably wouldn't watch it again. But I wouldn't tell somebody not to watch it. It's all silliness you'd expect in a Happy Madison picture.The movie was a very sooooooft six.",The Ridiculous 6

If you don't like his movies, don't watch them.I also get tired of all the serious critics that try and review Adam Sandler movies. There is not much to review. Most of his movies are moronic. But in that you often find lots of funny and entertaining comedy. Critics always sound surprised that Adam Sandler made another lousy movie. Adam Sandler movies have generated over $4 billion worldwide, so they obviously resonate with the audience. Stop being so critical.I watched Ridiculous 6 with my family, and we were all laughing at many of the really silly scenes. It was entertaining and fun. One of my favorite scenes was John Turturro playing Abner Doubleday and inventing the game of baseball. It had a Monty Python quality about it. It's absolutely hilarious!The cast is incredible.

The Story and characters were entertaining - the bad and good guys. Maybe this a stretch, but I liked it more than ""Waterboy"" and even "" how the Wild West was won"" by Seth McFarland.

There is not one ounce of wit or intelligence in the humour here. It's actually so stupid that it constantly borders on racist, even for somebody with a less PC centre. The jokes feel like they're from the '90s, before deliberate political incorrectness was swapped for subtlety and charm. It's like watching a film being released 20 years after it was made. This film is NOT funny. Maybe if you're below the age of 12 or you've never watched a good comedy you'll find it amusing. There are three nipple jokes, poo jokes and a hoard of cheap modern jokes that don't fit in with the time-period, completely bringing you out of the story every time they're spoken. As could be expected from an Adam Sandler film, the acting is dreadful. There's no attempt from the actors to provide something more than what the script reads, and everyone plays the blandest characters they possibly could. I don't think this movie warrants much more than that. If you have any taste. Don't watch it.",The Ridiculous 6
208,Bjc1128,"Yes, I gave this movie an 8.",8,24 July 2020,"Do I like Adam Sandler? Yes. Do I like all his movies... No!! I am a fan of the more ""refined"" Sandler movies: Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, 50 First Dates, Just Go With It, Spanglish, Bedtime Stories and even Grown Ups. I am not one for loud and silly obnoxious- though I did watch all of ""Jack & Jill"" with a cringe. I enjoy Sandler's creativity though often feel like in his younger years he needed less middle school humor, but that was the decade of the 1990's and a run off of his SNL days. This movie is silly but genuinely funny and surprisingly entertaining!! What also elevates the story is the cast members- well known stars who are genuinely funny!. Who knew the gap toothed dimly lit sidekick was the ""Twilight"" heartthrob wolf ""Jacob"" ?!
This movie had laughs, some unique Fictional characters mixed in with historical favorites. (Mark Twain poker party was my favorite.) It was not predictable, no gore or foul language and peppered with laughs and famous faces. It's a good time. I have watched it several times. I wish there was a ""Ridiculous 6.5"" but, you most often cannot recreate genius. ""Left Eye Gang"".. 😂",The Ridiculous 6
209,CapitanoIntegrity,"Embarrassingly racist, at most has a few entertaining scenes",2,29 December 2015,"I'm writing this while I'm watching The Ridiculous Six, which is Adam Sandler's latest comedy, that has come straight to Netflix. I've been previously warned that some of the Native American members of the production of the film walked off the set, on account of the racism involved in the film. I like to view myself as a mostly tolerant person, and also someone who can usually take a non-biased opinion on certain facets of culture.It begins with Adam Sandler portraying a Native American (not just in real life, but in the film as well) so he can ""protect himself"" while out scavenging for supplies in the Old West. It is made clear at this point, through character interaction, that he must pretend to be a white person, otherwise the American Settlers will slaughter him when he is found, because he is a Native American. So right away, there's already cultural appropriation in the film, rooted in the basic plot. The fact that Adam Sandler plays a man always hiding within the Native American Identity is outstandingly horrifying, and shameful in this day and age. As the story progresses, we can see that this movie is 100% tongue-in-cheek, but the level of racism is astounding. Every racial stigma of the Native American People that modern culture has tried to retire is brought back for seemingly small reasons to further the plot of the film, or to just make a poorly timed joke, which almost never lands. By the fourth scene it is obvious that the members of the production had no regard for the parties they may be harming in the name of ""comedy."" Surprising, I found it, that so many well-known people were ""innocently"" involved, and also Rob Schneider (no shocker there, and Steve Buschemi also is accompanying).Clearly this movie means to play off of the spaghetti westerns of the past and incorporate a modern comedy style, but they sorely miss the landing by incorporating archaic beliefs about people who have otherwise been cleared of racist stereotypes 10-plus years ago. Over and over again, this movie shows an outdated view of the Native American People by reducing them to equally outdated stereotypes.On top of it all, Happy Madison adds a ""Mystical Aspect"" by giving the main character supernatural powers to overcome incredible situations. Adam Sandler adds his usual jokes to it making the whole production seem sophomoric, but that doesn't excuse the laziness in portraying such racism.The jokes on ""barbarians"" overflow into the larger problem of associating the Native American culture with savage practices and beliefs. There is an underlying theme of ""brotherhood"", but it fails to extend to the culture it insults.Adam Sandler attempts to keep the movie above par by projecting his ""badass attitude"" all over the place, but it does not outshine the inequalities represented. Many will fall to the emotional physical drama of the movie, but the attempt is ridiculous, just as the movie suggests.There is also some question as to whether Terry Crews's character is represented beyond the racial stereotype presented in the film.At a point in the film, Mr. Sandler attempts to get a little off-topic by initiating a baseball game. I envision this is to distract audiences from the offensive background. I found it entertaining, nonetheless, but did not change the damage that had been stated.Don't get me wrong, there are some social stigmas represented in this film that I don't touch on. I can understand Mr. Sandler's comedy (a low-brow as it may be considered) and I don't think everything in this movie should be scrutinized. There is a certain license that Mr. Sandler is afforded to hit audiences for a monetary gain, I know that sounds bad, but that's the way the business works.In short, making a comedy about the overview of the travesty we committed on the Native American People isn't funny. Even under the banner of comedy, these words have hurt interlaced within the good intentions of making people laugh. If we have to make people laugh with hurtful stereotypes, then we shouldn't be saying anything at all.",The Ridiculous 6

The cameos are great, and the acting is superb. Just suspend disbelief, have a glass or two of wine, and enjoy the journey. It is great to see Jorge Garcia in film again, His comedy chops are on point. This movie came recommended from a friend, after watching the first few minutes, I wasn't sure it would hold my attention, I am so glad I stuck with it.

I'm looking to buy it on iTunes when it comes out. Every time I watch it I find some new line that cracks me up. I think 2015 was the year everyone was offended by something. The critics pretty much slammed it by calling it racist. Not at all. This movie makes fun of every ethnicities quirks. I think the media put heavy spin on the few native Americans that walked off the set. I'm sure the few that walked just decided it wasn't for them. I can't imagine the producers not being forthright in communicating what their intentions were and what folks can expect. Comedy has always done this to break down barriers. I have so many favorite parts, one that stands out the most is when I saw Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain. I about died.",The Ridiculous 6

The scale should go into negative numbers for me to truly rate this movie. I don't know WTF Adam was thinking with this one. It would have been more enjoyable sitting in the dentist's office having a root canal than watching this. If you like movie like Kung Pow then you would like this, it's just as idiotic. The acting is terrible. The donkey is disgusting. The third brother is infuriating. I don't even know where to start with the brother that was for lack of a better term a mountain man.

It's stupidly funny which is what we always get anytime we watch an Adam Sandler movie. People with no sense of humor should definitely not watch, but if you're a Sandler fan and you love all of his crazy characters and his way of providing entertainment then this movie is something that you will enjoy. He always has crazy characters that do the stupid things and that's what makes this movie so funny.

I thought the CGI was interesting and somewhat reminiscent of Kung Pow, Enter the Fist and Kung Fu Hustle in it's ridiculousness. Hey, it was entertaining. Lots of old faces showed up out of the Sandler fold. Also, some new faces showed. Who doesn't like Terry Crews? If you like Sandler's flicks then you'll like it. I LOVED it! The Blake Shelton cameo was priceless and let me tell you, dude can act. The burrow, the burrow was the unsung hero. The movie had a good ""Ridiculous"" story, good plot progression and action.

He was so funny I laughed every time he spoke. I love that all the same people that are always in movies with Adam showed up at some point. It may not be a 10/10 but it's definitely not a 1/10 in my opinion: I thought it was funny and I intend to buy it for my boyfriend because he also loved it. It kind of reminded me of Hombre with one of my favorite actors of all time (Paul Newman) because Adam is an Indian but he's white and then goes on this journey.

The cast of characters, some old SNL characters, and some other comedians. Much like the old airplane movies, history of the world humor but modernized.The plot was different, a western comedy. Some adult comments so teens can handle. Highly recommended for laughs. If you want to enjoy a fun movie then it's worth watching. .....even vanilla ice is in it.

It sets out to be funny, an aim which it fails to achieve spectacularly. Having missed that one, and with no other redeeming qualities, it has nowhere to go. It flounders haphazardly from one embarrassingly awkward scene to the next with minimal continuity. I confess I gave up after an hour of squirming uncomfortably but I don't think it could have been saved even if the last half was chocked full of Willis, Gieldgud and Branagh.This film is a waste of 2 hours of your life, 2 hours which you will never get back, DO SOMETHING ELSE!!!",The Ridiculous 6

Sandler movies are dumb fun, but the bottom line is they're fun. They're stupid, deliberately silly and at times over the top, that's the point. If someone doesn't get that by now, the problem is clearly with you, not Sandler.This movie was FREE on Netflix, as in you didn't pay sh*t to watch it and could have watched anything else. So leave Sandler alone, could ya? He makes fun movies with a wide cast of talent who clearly are having fun themselves in making silly entertainment. Casting Vanilla Ice as a rapping Mark Twain was hysterical. Steven Zahn as the wanna-be gang member, very enjoyable. Abner Doubleday making up the game he says he is ""inventing"" is the kind simple humor the world needs more of. Bottom line, if you've seen the Magnificent 7 (or even if you haven't) and have even the slightest soft spot for Sandler's brand of simple, dumb humor, you should enjoy this movie. Unlike most of the IMDb reviewers here, Sandler has no pretensions, but delivers fun, enjoyable, and yes - at time dumb humor with a heart.

Adam Sandler failed to make me laugh this time badly. The characters were not arranged to deliver a fine output.Besides,the movie was too long,and the story was not enough to support such a long duration.There was no real suspense or rise up moment in the story.

I couldn't even tell if they were actually supposed to be jokes. Plus, big surprise, the homely near-50 year old man is coupled with a drop-dead gorgeous women a good 20 years younger. I guess that part is a little funny. I kept hoping that the real main character, someone who would be a foil for the idiocy on display, would show up. I thought surely, there's no way this would get made without some edge, some point, something to make it worthwhile. But no such luck. The main character is an unfunny dolt, and he is supposed to be the source of humor. What a disaster. Netflix really missed the ball on this one.

People act as if this movie was the worst thing since Hitler. Anyone who has the slightest amount of funny bone in their body, would give a chuckle at this. The movie poked fun at certain topics, but that doesn't mean it's a god forsaken ""fail"" at comedy. Basically almost any successful comedy has some sort of crude humor in it. May I mention Blazing Saddles? People on this site getting offended over this movie, aren't really willing to see the humor of this movie. It wasn't that bad! Can't we all acknowledge that this movie poses no threat? It isn't oppressing you. Does comedy really need to be censored? Why can't people just learn to laugh at things in life? We all acknowledge that these stereotypes aren't true... Unless you personally feel that you are what these stereotypes are, then you shouldn't be offended. If you know that they aren't true, you shouldn't feel offended. I come from a family with all of these backgrounds. Native American, African American, and southern white, and I feel no shame from liking this movie'The movie was pretty enjoyable. It had flat moments, but I found myself laughing at it. The over exaggeration was what made it mostly funny. Aside from Native American stereotypes, they also stereotyped Texans as ""native hating."" Or ""low in IQ."" All in all, it was still humorous. The acting was decent, and so was the script. It wasn't the best comedy I've seen, but I still liked it. Lastly, all I can say is that you need to watch this movie with an open mind. It's a fun movie, and it has its flaws, but it isn't taboo. Don't listen to the negativity! Give it a shot.",The Ridiculous 6

The movie is actually hilarious and Lautner plays an amazing part in this.My opinion, watch the movie, give it an hour, then be the judge for yourself, don't let these guys who think they know everything be the judge of what you watch.

As someone else pointed out, kids probably will love it which is why I used to love movies like Ace Ventura and others that I consider to be ""stupid comedies"" with no acting. But that's the point! If he wanted serious acting he would have a completely different script and actors, but then it wouldn't be a Adam Sandler slap stick stupid comedy. It gets old to hear people that can't handle mild racial jokes that were not just about Native Americans, but other races as well, even White people. If you don't have the maturity to handle silly comedy with racial slurs, then don't watch it. Anyway, movies are a business targeted at a specific target audience. If you didn't know what you were going to watch prior to watching this, then that's your issue for not researching enough into the movie. Don't complain about a movie you don't like if the genre isn't to your liking. It's as if I were to complain about a romantic movie saying it was too romantic and mushy and rated it low because I'm not a fan of romantic movies. Now that I'm off my soapbox, it started off rough I thought, at least it took me longer than typical to get into the movie and see where it was leading. But by the end I really enjoyed it. You just have to remind yourself the type of movie you're watching. I think the plot was just as good as it could be in order to tie in the characters they created. Overall it deserves a much higher rating than what it has received. No its not a 10, but it did well with the casting and the silliness of the movie.

This movie somewhat reminded me of You Can't Mess With The Zohan, it was that kind of humor, the fighting reminded me of that. I was, however, impressed with the amount of big named celebrities in this film. Could this movie had been done differently to where it was a complete success? I would say yes, but it is what it is, not total garbage, but not a complete success, not everyone can make a western based comedy and pull it off.

Apparently I'm alone with that, oh well.It's very un-pc, and again it's not meant to be taken seriously. How can you love SouthPark, but find this film offensive ? It's beyond me.Jorge Garcia as the hairy hermit Herm was absolutely hilarious, and Taylor Lautner did a brilliant job as the hillbilly little Pete.

The whole film Sandler seems to be on autopilot. Taylor Lautner's ""try hard retard"" act should have ended up on the cutting room floor(BAD). I will stop now before it get's nasty.

The film has very little real entertainment value, other than how low Sandler's career has fallen. 6 brothers who have nothing in common, other than they are all stereotypes of slow, rob banks to save their father they don't even know. Nick Noltes career has also fallen that this is what he is now playing as an actor. It had a good cast of funny-men, but they just weren't funny.

(Which usually isn't a valid reason for watching a movie in my opinion.)The more the movie went on, the more I grew fond of that western-oriented world and I ended up watching the whole movie, since I like most of Adam Sandler's movies.However, even if there were SOME hilarious material, the plot isn't worth much to me and I didn't enjoy it as much as most of the Happy Madison's productions.To put it in a nutshell, it's not that bad when you don't have any expectations...",The Ridiculous 6
243,dantediss,oh man.....,1,17 December 2015,"There is a line near the end of this film,... ""s#!t happens"". Perfect summary of this film. Seriously this is hours of your life you will never get back. you would be better off just imagining this movie in your own head. it would more than likely be more entertaining and cohesive. IMDb requires a minimum 10 lines of review to post,... i am finding it difficult to even pump out 2. which means i am just as dedicated as the people who put this film together. to think that netflix signed a deal with sandler to produce more films after this too ughh. i may be reconsidering renewing my netflix subscription seeing as how it funds trash like this.",The Ridiculous 6
244,jscotthobby,Another Sandler flick that made me angry instead of making me laugh.,1,17 December 2015,"More of the same garbage from Adam Sandler. This abomination has the same thing nearly all his other movies have had: humor that only eight, nine and maybe ten-year-old boys would (should) think was hilarious. Problem is, much of it is not AT ALL appropriate for that age range -- undoubtedly this would be, deservedly, PG-13 in theaters had Netflix not picked it up. It is stunning to me that his movies rake in so much cash, and that so many bonafide actors (Keitel, Buscemi, Zahn, etc) agree to be in them. And I like Dan Patrick has a sports personality -- but come on ... these movies hurt your brand sir. Bad look. So it's come to this: I honestly believe that if not for the normal bodily functions of humans (and animals of course) for Sandler to make fun of -- over and over and over again in this, and about all of his movies, he'd be a broke joke remembered mostly for his okay SNL skits from 25 years ago. A truly awful movie that I couldn't get but about half-way through it was so bad. One star out of 10.",The Ridiculous 6
245,corpmagic,The movie is worse than the explosive diarreah that spews from the donkey.,1,19 December 2015,"This movie has motivated me to sign up and submit my very first review. When will I ever learn ???? And what were actors of the calibre of Terry Crews, (whom I didn't get in far enough to even see), Nick Nolte and Jon Lovitz (again didn't get into the movie far enough to see him) doing in this movie ? Did they really need the work or the money this desperately. I have just jettisoned this movie (perhaps the number of people who paid full price to see this movie.) after about 15 to 20 minutes. When will I learn that when the names Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider are attached to a movie it is intended strictly for 4 demographic groups : 1) male children between the ages of 5 and 8 2) men between 18 and mid-twenties who are very drunk 3) men between 18 and mid-twenties who are very high 4) men between 18 and mid- twenties who are very drunk and high. Everyone else save your money and more importantly your time. Please avoid this example of digital diarreah. Who finances him making this self-indulgent low-brow crap ?",The Ridiculous 6
246,williammuir-61423,Ridiculous 6,6,22 December 2015,"OK, this is actually not the worst Adam Sandler movie, and it is supposed to be Ridiculous- It even says so in the title!!! I don't think it's particularly well done- but it isn't supposed to be. It is supposed to be a goofy, half ass western and it achieves some laughs. If you want a slapstick western action flick with fart jokes this is it. As long as you aren't looking for high brow Shakespeare stuff I think you'll be OK. I mean, Vanilla Ice plays Mark Twain!! That casting- It's such a mix of genius and stupidity!!! Everyone needs to calm down with their hate for this movie. It is unwarranted. I am giving 6 stars to the Ridiculous 6. It might not deserve all them, but it is much better than the just one some people have been saying.",The Ridiculous 6
247,genuine-36723,It's Ridiculous; What Did You Expect?,6,27 December 2015,"I know Adam Sandler's humor borders on juvenile, and I expect his films to contain various levels of offensive activity. For this reason, I watched this movie expecting Sandler humor and I got it. The Doubleday scene was the cleverest, I think, and I enjoyed it. :) Go Adam Sandler; this is a strong return to what you love to do! If you are looking for a deep exploration of humanity, you probably shouldn't watch an Adam Sandler film. If you're looking for a snarky British comedy, you probably shouldn't watch an Adam Sandler film. If you love Jack*ass or MTV's Ridiculousness, you'll probably love it. I must warn you; this is not a movie for children. There are sexual references--typically of Adam Sandler flicks--that you don't want to have to explain to the little ones.",The Ridiculous 6
248,szuckswert,Best Unique Humor in a movie in a long time!,10,4 January 2016,"My wife and I couldn't stop laughing! It was so politically incorrect (in a funny, not a snide or insulting way) we just couldn't stop laughing.Sometimes we watch highly rated comedies or shows hoping for even a single laugh.I think this movie was much funnier than Blazing Saddles since it didn't snobbishly intellectually make politically incorrect ""jokes"" that requires you to be ""intellectually truly superior and clever to ""get"" it.Feel free to snobbishly reject and condemn this movie for its failure to follow the acceptable structure for intellectually proper politically incorrect humor and be so intellectually refined, or you might just enjoy the different and unique humor!

249,king_humble,it's worth a watch just to see all the stars,5,13 January 2016,"here's how i watched the movie. i had IMDb open, reviewing the cast, and reviewing their careers, wondering how they ended up here. so yes, once a scene is introduced, you can pay attention to your computer, again. the fun part of the movie was waiting for the new scene, and waiting for some star to pop up. this is how you will get through the movie, trust me. harvey keitel was fun. blake shelton. vanilla ice. i can only imagine what the poor American indians were thinking. i signed up for IMDb just to post this review. this is my service to you, so ya don't make the mistake of popping corn. there is not enough for me to say to reach ten lines, and my review is beginning to feel as tedious as the two hours we'll all kill to get through this flick. hopefully, you do drugs",The Ridiculous 6
250,jpjones-88696,Good old Sandler!,6,19 January 2016,"Look, this is an Adam Sandler movie. It is not going to win any awards (unless it gets an award for making you laugh). Some of it is dumb. Some of it is REALLY dumb. Though if you take the time to sift through the donkey dung you will find some nuggets of gold (at least one). I promise. Which is why I really don't understand all the poor reviews. What do people want? What do people expect? This movie does what every Adam Sandler movie does. It makes you laugh by giving you something you never expected. Something you probably did not want or need. Something you could have lived without. But he gives it to you and you laugh and you walk away shaking your head trying to get that vision out of your brain. Watch it. It is fun.",The Ridiculous 6
251,alex-96456,Horrific. Just unbelievably bad.,1,4 June 2017,"Netflix, if you're going to support films that are atrocious to women and inherently racist then at least make them funny...Truly the worst film I've ever seen.I mean it genuinely makes me sad that there are thousands of incredibly talented writers in the independent film world that would make a movie 1 million times better for 1/10 of the price but instead, Adam Sandler is getting millions to keep making this trash. And the worst part is that money is coming from a company that is a leader in pushing boundaries and better representation.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised it was hailed as a success despite shocking reviews... we are living in a world where Donald Trump is president afterall!",The Ridiculous 6
252,coreyareeves,Typical,10,11 November 2020,Either you love his work or you dont. There is no middle with sandler and his band of friends. So in closing i tip my hat to the cast and crew. Job well done,The Ridiculous 6
253,kellyluciana,Love it!,10,13 May 2017,"OK. This is just a mix of goofy comedy with dark humor as a normal Adlan Sander does. Don't take seriously, don't try to make a normal sense but if you have a bad day and want to have a good laugh watch it! I particularly love the baseball part and love the acting from Taylor. He is awesome not being the hot boy. Plus has all the actors that I love for the last decade. Enjoy, get a popcorn and have a good time.",The Ridiculous 6

255,ms_bubblegum,Great addition to my Sandler Collection.,10,23 February 2018,This movie is ridiculously hilarious. It was not predictable and in no way slow. I have watched it at least ten times and I still cry/laugh during parts that I know are coming. Its great!,The Ridiculous 6
256,joylynduron,Surprisingly enjoyable.,10,12 September 2020,"If u are a normal movie enthusiast, not a critic, and just want to enjoy a movie; have fun and watch this. Don't get why critics give this too low of a score, why are they trying other ""normal"" people to enjoy a good movie like this? Like less than 5 out 10? This must be at least 6. Like what the hell, be fair! There are a lot of movies out there that is really below 5. Not this one!! You critics, should just go to rotten tomatoes, give any score u want, cause I dont go there for review. But please dont take a away good movies like this from us. Good thing my husband was watching this, and I just took a look, after 5 mins I got hooked. I got here to check how this movie scores in IMDB because I really enjoyed it. But got dissapointed seeing the score. A lot of reviewers here are the ridiculous ones. Writing a review for the very first time here, to support this movie. Please help pull up the score!",The Ridiculous 6
257,jamesmech,"Please stop, Adam!",1,3 August 2018,"I suppose this might be considered Adam Sandler's attempt at making a ""Blazing Saddles"" for the Millenials, but it falls so far short in every aspect... Comedy, not funny... Story line, moronic... Special effects, Ugh! There wasn't anything in this movie that made me even smile, the gags were so 3rd grader. C'mon Adam. We know you can do a lot better than this. Remember ""Happy Gilmore"", or ""Waterboy""? Yeah, that's the Sandler we haven't seen in years. Your brother the lawyer is way funnier than you, these days. Maybe you should hire him on as a writer.",The Ridiculous 6
258,doraustea,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,14 April 2021,"I have never watched a movie more emberassing and depressing as this one. I am honestly baffled by how it got this high of a score because it lacks any creativity, comprehensive message or value. I did not laugh ONCE. You can see how Adam Sandler hates himself during the movie and isn't even trying anymore. I wish I never even knew this dump existed, I would be a much happier person.",The Ridiculous 6
259,blazzegirl,Great Comedy,10,26 August 2018,You can not go by half of these review sites. This is a Adam Sandler comedy. It is meant to be off the wall out of the box. It's a shame that a lot of these critics seem to give pour reviews that don't even truly give the movie the proper justice. I would recommend this movie as it's well worth watching.,The Ridiculous 6
260,sarahscottgbre,Hilarious,10,17 September 2018,You guys that gave this ridiculous hilariousness less than ten stars have the sense of humor of an old school marm. It's stupid funny. Do yourself a favor and watch. You're welcome.,The Ridiculous 6
261,trb-60913,I should have cleaned the litterbox or toilet instead...,1,22 March 2020,"I've liked most Sandler movies but this one ranks (pun intended) down with the lowest Hollywood flops like ""Jack and Jill"", ""Showgirls"" and nearly every cheap attempted re-make like Ghost Busters, Conan the Barbarian, etc...Laughed not once. Felt urge to laugh not once. Attempts at humor were predictable, over-used, strained and desperately throwing feces at the ""comedy wall"" hoping anything would stick. I keep hoping for smarter scripts from him like 50 First Dates, Click, Grown-Ups and The Wedding Singer. Just watch the BEST western spoof ever made, Blazing Saddles, and don't waste your time with this one.",The Ridiculous 6
