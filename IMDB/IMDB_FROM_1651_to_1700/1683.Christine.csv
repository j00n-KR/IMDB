0,Leofwine_draca,"A nice score, but given the pedigree this is pretty uninvolving",6,9 February 2016,"It's surprising how many movies there are in the ""killer vehicle"" sub-genre out there. From classics like DUEL to yawners like THE HEARSE and abominations like WHEELS OF TERROR and TRUCKS, somebody is always ready to make a buck out of a wheeled menace. Stephen King even wrote a whole book about one in his own inimitable style and it wasn't long before CHRISTINE the movie followed. Sadly, it's not one of the master's best because it fails to make the car of the title a threatening menace at all. Sure, it's cool when Christine gets a life of her own and mows down street thugs and repairs herself after being damaged but a scary screen presence? Not at all. More like a few clever special effects and a good driver is what we have and it's a film which left me cold.The biggest disappointment is that John Carpenter directed it, at a period in his career when he still made intelligent, scary horror films. CHRISTINE isn't one of them. This goreless chiller goes for the subtle, almost psychological approach to its horror rather than OTT blood and guts, but a little grue surely would have livened things up a bit. As it stands, probably the best thing in the film's favour is the music, which is typically good for Carpenter and makes the plot suspenseful. The screen is often awash with darkness and shadows but for what? The car isn't menacing, just a nuisance. As the film progresses, pyrotechnics are brought into play (the explosion of the petrol station) as if they forgot it was a horror film and went for action instead. Then there's the drawn-out finale, which seems to go on and on endlessly with little resolve.Keith Gordon is good in the leading part of Arnie Cunningham. Transforming from a friendless geek into a hard-assed popular guy, he portrays the mental possession and obsession of his character very well indeed. John Stockwell is ineffectual as the best friend, however, and Alexandra Paul makes very little of her part as the girlfriend-in-distress. Even usually reliable veterans like Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton are wasted in nothing parts. The scene in which Christine rebuilds herself from a total wreck to a car in pristine condition is memorable, yes, but nothing about the film really shines. At the end of the day it seems both slow-moving and lacking in real chills. Watch it only for the music.",Christine
1,SnoopyStyle,Some cars are born bad,6,2 October 2013,"Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is the school nerd. His best friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) thinks he just needs to get laid. Dennis can defend him from bullies, but just can't keep him from buying a clunker.Christine is a rusting piece of junk that Arnie falls for right away. She has a dark history and becomes Arnie's obsession. It's an obsession that turns the nerd into a confident bad boy.For a movie by director John Carpenter and from a Stephen King, I expect lots of blood, deaths, and mayhem. But the action doesn't start till very late, and the middle really didn't have any horror moments. Unless choking on a burger is scary. And some of the kills just don't pass the mustard. A car is slowly grinding along to pin you against a wall. It seems relatively easy to climb on top of the car. Keith Gordon does make both the nerd and the jerk believable. But the final battle is just not big enough.",Christine
2,Prismark10,Do not knock Christine,6,29 January 2019,"John Carpenter turns his back on visceral horror. Instead he is inspired by films such as Grease, Animal House and television shows like Happy Days. Nostalgia, rock n roll and a demonic car.From the early scenes we can sense Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a High School nerd. He has never had a girlfriend. The big surprise is that his best friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) is still hanging around with him. Dennis attracts women and is the top football player at school.Arnie gets bullied at school with Dennis coming to the rescue.When Arnie spots an old clapped out red 1957 Plymouth, he just has to buy it despite Dennis insisting that the car is junk.Arnie becomes obsessed to fix up the car. He gets to help out in a garage where he works on Christine night and day.Next time Dennis sees Arnie. Christine is spruced up and Arnie has a hot date, whereas Dennis gets injured at the football field.Arnie is a changed man. Confident, even arrogant and rude. However after some incidents Dennis finds out the true history relating to Christine.John Carpenter went for a slow build up of suspense with this Stephen King story. It probably is the best way to deal with a possessed car. Each time Christine gets angry the radio turns on.When the high school bullies damage Christine, both Arnie and the car ride after them for revenge. Harry Dean Stanton plays the cop who seems to be more bothered where Arnie got that shade of red paint from to repair Christine.It is a silly, flawed film but done so well by Carpenter.",Christine
3,mark.waltz,Scarry scarry bang bang!,7,5 May 2021,"There is a ""whoa!"" Moment an hour into this adaption of the Stephen King novel which is more than just a male version of ""Carrie"". Keith Gordon is a geeky high school kid in his senior year, misunderstood by his parents and brutally harassed by the school punks. When he comes across an old car, he expresses interest in buying it from the brother of the previous owner, and finds out that it has a bit of a history. The harassment of the kids continues, and the car takes revenge for him.Like Amy Irving in ""Carrie"", Gordon has a cool kid on his side, and it's actually a best friend rather than someone who's just trying to do right. He's John Stockwell, a class jock who has been there to support him through the difficult times, and he even gets himself beat up in protecting Gordon. There's also the new pretty girl who likes him (Alexandra Paul), so it's not like Gordon doesn't have a chance of survival. But the bullies are brutal, so when Christine, the name of the car given by the late owner, takes it's revenge, it's brutal and violent.This has a good supporting cast including Roberts Blossom (a veteran at playing spooky characters), Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton, and while the film is not as graphic as ""Carrie"", that actually has a bigger impact because of the subtlety. Christine has the ability to rebuild itself, basically rising like the phoenix. That makes this a modern horror classic that takes an old theme and puts a unique twist on it.",Christine
4,claudio_carvalho,"Christine, The Car-Killer",8,4 December 2014,"In 1957, in Detroit, a red Plymouth Fury is build and causes two accidents, one of them fatal, still in the assembly line. Twenty-one years later, the outcast and bullied nerd Arnold ""Arnie"" Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is getting a ride with his best and only friend Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) and he sees the wrecked car in a junkyard. Arnie immediately falls in love with the car and calls it Christine. He buys the car and brings it to the repair shop of the despicable Will Darnell (Robert Prosky) and works hard to restore the classic car. While he works in the restoration, he changes his personality to a cocky teenager and he dates the most beautiful girl in the high-school, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). Soon Arnie becomes selfish and jealous of the supernatural Christine that kills everyone that is a threat to them.""Christine"" is remarkable and unforgettable feature from John Carpenter and it is difficult to find out who that has not seen this movie at least once. The classic story of a supernatural car that fall in love with its owner is not dated and has outstanding special effects for a 1983 movie. This is practically the first successful feature of the gorgeous Alexandra Paul and Keith Gordon and John Stockwell have great performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Christine, O Carro Assassino"" (""Christine, The Car Killer"")Note: On 16 Sep 2020, I saw this film again.",Christine
5,kosmasp,Material Girl,7,9 June 2020,"Though don't be fooled by the fact it's a ""girl"" (the name does suggest that, don't make it about the envy and/or jealousy) or made out of ... material. My summary line aside though, this is based on a Stephen King novel. One I have not read yet, so I can't talk about how this fair in comparison or any changes that may or may not be in the movie.Talking of change, one of the main characters goes through quite a change. Not just physical (like the car), but also mentally (I reckon the car stays with one mindset all the time). It is quite the transformation and the fact we have other bad guys to root against, makes this sometimes morally ambigious. Also most like to cheer on the little man/guy ... but to what extend/end? And until when? Is there a breaking point? No pun intended ... the premise is quite out there - if you dig it, you will really like it.",Christine
6,gavin6942,A King-Carpenter Classic,7,26 October 2013,"A nerdish boy (Keith Gordon) buys a strange car with an evil mind of its own and his nature starts to change to reflect it.This film is today a modern horror classic. Whether you think Christine is a 1957 or 1958 Plymouth Fury (there is room for debate), we all know she is deadly. And as the deleted scenes have started to pile up, we further get the impression this was a fleshed out film -- a Carpenter masterpiece alongside a King master novel.I love that Roberts Blossom was in this film, because horror fans will recognize him as Ezra Cobb from ""Deranged"" while everyone knows him from ""Home Alone"" as the neighbor with the dark rumors swirling about him...",Christine
7,lee_eisenberg,"""The Love Bug""...as written by Stephen King",10,6 November 2006,"When I was really young, I saw the Disney movie ""The Love Bug"". This led me to believe that automobile-themed movies could only be ""cute"". But I never could have predicted what I would see in John Carpenter's movie version of Stephen King's novel ""Christine"". This movie has a lot going for itself: nostalgia, realization of new strength, and more all rolled into one.At the beginning, we see 1957 Detroit, where some people are building cars; it could be the manifestation of good, hard-working Americans on their way to achieving the American Dream. But then, the hood on one of the cars smashes a guy's hand. A few minutes later, a man sits in the car...and is found dead a few minutes later. Maybe the American Dream isn't really what they say it is (possibly an allusion to the eventual closure of the auto industry in Detroit, turning the city into an urban wasteland).Fast forward to 1978 LA, where young Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is the bullied school nerd. That is, until he buys the car that we earlier saw getting produced. He quickly changes his look and is clearly getting infatuated with this car. But this car is equally infatuated with him, and anyone who challenges their relationship might not live to tell about it.Probably the best scene is when the car repairs itself. That scene, more than any other, really shows not only what the car is, but also what Arnie is turning into. And the '50s music is great to hear. I would say that ""Christine"" is probably the second greatest adaptation of a Stephen King novel behind ""The Shining"". Also starring Harry Dean Stanton, Roberts Blossom and Robert Prosky.Definitely bad to the bone...",Christine
8,jboothmillard,Christine,5,3 August 2020,"This was one of those movie titles I always remembered, because I knew it was based on a book by Stephen King, and then I realised it was the one featuring an evil car, so I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch it, directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, Escape from New York, The Thing, Starman). Basically, in September 1957, in Detroit, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant, a newly assembled, red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury rolls down the production line. Without warning, a factory worker is injured, when his hand is crushed when the bonnet roof falls. Another worker gets in and sits behind the wheel, letting ash from his cigar fall on the front seat. This worker's corpse is found at the end of the shift by the line supervisor after notices the car's radio is playing music. Twenty-one years later, in September 1978, in Rockbridge, California, Arnold ""Arnie"" Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is an awkward and unpopular teenager with only one friend, football player Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell). Whilst driving with Dennis, Arnie spots the used, dilapidated Fury, he decides to buy it from George LeBay (Roberts Blossom) believing that he can restore it. George tells Arnie several details about the car, including its name: ""Christine"", and that his late brother Roland originally owned it. Arnie's parents, mother Regina (Christine Belford) and father Michael (Robert Darnell), refuse to let him keep the car at their house, so Arnie takes it to a do-it-yourself garage and junkyard owned by Will Darnell (Robert Prosky). As Arnie spends more of his time working on the car, he stops wearing his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s greaser, and develops an arrogant, paranoid personality. Unbeknownst to Arnie, Dennis learns from Arnie's mother that George's brother actually committed suicide in the car. Dennis confronts George, who admits that Roland's daughter had choked to death in the car and that his wife also committed suicide in it. Roland had tried to get rid of Christine after his wife's death, but the car returned to him after three weeks. During a football game, Dennis is distracted seeing Arnie kissing his new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), in front of the fully restored Christine. Dennis ends up tackled and suffers a career-ending injury. One of Christine's windshield wipers stops working while Arnie and Leigh are on a date at a drive-in movie theatre. When he gets out to fix it, Leigh begins to choke on a hamburger and the doors lock themselves, leaving Arnie unable to help her. But she frees herself and is saved when a man in a nearby car administers the Heimlich manoeuvre. Arnie has been displaying strange behaviour towards his car, and when alone often talks to Christine. Soon afterward, school bully Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander), angry with Arnie over being expelled after a confrontation in shop class, vandalises Christine with the help of his gang. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine but is surprised when she suddenly restores herself. Christine seeks out the vandals, driverless she crushes one in an alley, triggering a gas station explosion that kills two others and sets the car on fire, and finally runs down Buddy himself. After the badly burned Christine returns to Darnell's garage, Darnell sits in the driver's seat and is crushed to death between the steering wheel and the seat pushing forward. The next morning, Christine is back in its slot and fully repaired. Detective Rudolph Junkins (Harry Dean Stanton) is investigating the events and becomes suspicious of Arnie, having discovered paint from Christine at the scenes of two of gang member deaths. However, he has no substantial evidence implicating Arnie, who has an alibi. Following the choking incident and the previous vandalization, Leigh breaks up with Arnie. Dennis and Leigh conclude the only way to save Arnie is to destroy Christine. They set a trap for it at Darnell's garage: Dennis waits at the controls of a bulldozer, while Leigh is ready to close the garage doors and stop Christine escaping once it enters. However, Christine has been lying in wait under a pile of debris in the garage the entire time. Christine strikes, crashing through Darnell's office and tries to get at Leigh. Arnie, who has been driving the car himself, is thrown through the windshield and dies being impaled on a shard of glass. Dennis and Leigh attack Christine with the bulldozer, but it continually repairs itself and strikes back. The battle continues until they repeatedly drive back and forth over the car, damaging Christine so much that it is unable to immediately regenerate. The next day, Dennis, Leigh and Junkins watch as Christine is compacted by a junkyard car crusher and drops to the ground as a solid block. Junkins praises Dennis and Leigh for defeating the demonic vehicle, but they mourn the loss of Arnie. As they walk away and the camera zooms in slowly on the remains, a portion of the front grill begins to twitch. Also starring David Spielberg as Mr. Casey, Malcolm Danare as Moochie, Steven Tash as Rich, Stuart Charno as Don Vandenberg, and Kelly Preston as Roseanne. Gordon gives a good performance as the nerdy geek turned dude, and Christine is a beautiful looking vehicle, but a nasty piece of work. The films boasts a splendid soundtrack, including 50s hits ""Keep A-Knockin'"" - Little Richard, ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" - Thurston Harris, and the fantastically fitting ""Bad to the Bone"" - George Thorogood and the Destroyers. I agree the film is a little long and slightly more darkly funny than scary, but to see a cool sassy car going on a rampage, it is a fun supernatural horror. Worth watching!",Christine
9,Woodyanders,An excellent and underrated John Carpenter horror film,8,28 March 2007,"Hopelessly geeky teen nerd Arnie Cunnigham (a terrific performance by Keith Gordon) buys a beat-up junker of a '58 Plymouth Fury named Christine and lovingly restores the car to its former exquisitely pristine glory. Arnie makes a gradual transition from hapless unhip dweeb to ultra-smooth cool dude. Meanwhile, Arnie's nasty tormentors start meeting brutal untimely ends. Is it Arnie or Christine who's behind the killings?Director John Carpenter, working from a sharp, witty and astute script by Bill Phillips that's based on a Stephen King novel, begins the film as a compelling and perceptive character study of a forlorn misfit individual and slowly develops the movie into a truly chilling full-blown horror picture, with Christine's deadly wrath and Arnie's startling metamorphosis into a bitter sociopath making for a genuinely frightening double act. Moreover, the raw, profane dialogue, vivid high school milieu and credibly messed-up teenage characters all ring true. Better still, the story offers a touching, intriguing and incisive meditation on America's obsessive infatuation with automobiles and the basic adolescent need to fit in, get revenge on everyone who makes your teen years the proverbial living hell, and be a winner instead of a loser. The uniformly strong acting from a top-drawer cast qualifies as another significant asset: John Stockwell as Arnie's affable, charming jock best friend Dennis Guilder, Alexandra Paul as Arnie's sweet, gorgeous girlfriend Leigh Cabot, Robert Prosky as coarse'n'crusty slob garage owner Will Darnell, William Ostrander as vicious bully Buddy Repperton, Christine Belford as Arnie's worried mother Regina, Harry Dean Stanton as laid-back, but diligent Detective Rudolph Junkins, Roberts Blossom as the sleazy eccentric George Lebay who sells Christine to Arnie, and Kelly Preston as vapid bimbo cheerleader Roseanne. Donald M. Morgan's slick, polished cinematography (the image of a flaming Christine chasing a fleeing Buddy down the road is positively breathtaking), a splendidly spooky'n'shivery score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth, and the first-rate vintage 50's golden oldies soundtrack are all likewise on the money. A fine and under-appreciated little gem.",Christine
10,ccthemovieman-1,Don't Mess With Christine!,7,20 December 2005,"I'm not particularly a fan of horror movies and I couldn't fix an ailing automobile if my life depended on it so the workings of cars don't fascinate me.....but this movie fascinated me. The '58 Plymouth Fury, alias ""Christine,"" is absolutely gorgeous. What a piece of machinery! This is a horror story but there are no ghosts or monsters nor is there any gore. A car is the star of the film, a very jealous and vengeful one at that. Man, that sounds silly but, if you're reading this you have probably watched the movie so no sense going into details. It's hard to describe the story in a paragraph without it sounding stupid....but it's not. Maybe the quickest way to explain it is that it is about a car that is alive, like a human, and you mess with it, you pay!It is definitely one creepy, well-made, unique and always-entertaining film.The car is a lot better than any of the people, sad to say. No, I didn't like any of the kids in this film (high schoolers who all look 30 years old!) and the language is a little too rough in spots, but that can be filtered out.The car, the '50s music, the unique story, the satisfying revenge angle all make this very watchable.",Christine
11,BA_Harrison,Never gets into top gear.,7,3 March 2011,"Director John Carpenter slips behind the wheel of a Stephen King classic and like any proud driver of a prestige vehicle he ensures that Christine looks her best, giving his movie the equivalent of a gold wash followed by two coats of wax.Sadly, just like many an owner of a classic car, he's reluctant to really put her through her paces for fear of marking the bodywork or blowing a gasket; as a result, this film is a comfortable enough ride, but it never pushes the pedal to the metal enough to give viewers those all important goose-bumps.The cast are great, the cinematography is wonderful, the effects are cool, and the soundtrack is simply superb, a mix of modern tracks, rock 'n' roll classics, and ominous synth tunes, but still the magic doesn't happen. Part of the problem lies in the script, which alters or omits some of the best parts of the book, but much of the blame must be on Carpenter's less than brilliant storytelling: individual scenes certainly impress, but the film as a whole just doesn't get the pistons pounding, lacking the creepiness and scares that we know the man can deliver when on top form.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Christine
12,moonspinner55,"Nostalgic sludge, processed like Swiss cheese...",3,3 November 2007,"Stephen King's books (and the movies adapted from his books) are likely to divide audiences more so than any other works from a universally popular writer. King, who began as sort of a cult figure on the horror scene, had gone completely commercial by the time his ""Christine"" rolled around, so it's no surprise that John Carpenter directed the adaptation (Carpenter's career in movies followed in much the same pattern). The combined influences of derivative, processed thrills and instantly-recognizable cars and music (and a plot about a have-not who becomes a blood-soaked geek king) target teen audiences who have no use for subtext and no regard for subtleties. Carpenter sets up this story pretty well, but his maliciousness has no sting, and lead actor Keith Gordon isn't handled at all well (Gordon is too trained at this sort of role; I would have preferred clean-cut buddy John Stockwell in the central part, which might have given viewers a transformation they could believe in). The possessed car who overcomes its owner, a 1958 Plymouth Fury, ends up giving the film's best performance, but Carpenter keeps muffing the suspense--until it all looks no more menacing than a late-night TV show. *1/2 from ****",Christine
13,dbdumonteil,deadly vehicle round 2,4,23 June 2006,"From the eighties onwards, it became trendy to adapt one of the most prolific and popular American writers, Stephen King for the silver screen and the telly. I must say that I'm not a devotee of his work at all. Ditto for John Carpenter whose filmography didn't embellish the horror/fantasy genre except maybe at a pinch: ""Halloween"" (1978).The tenet of a cursed vehicle that gives the ones who have the misfortune to stand in its way a hard time isn't novel. Steven Spielberg's debut movie, ""Duel"" (1971) revolved around the same thrust with the difference that it was an enormous truck instead of a car that tracked down Dennis Weaver and the film was gripping in its dramatic progression. Spielberg's making nearly evolved on the razor's edge and ""Duel"" is one of his finest cinematographic moments to date. And his movie kept a part of mystery: was there really a driver in the truck or not? In Carpenter's flick, this zone of shadow is clarified: ""Christine"" is possessed by devilish forces and can drive (and mend) itself. Carpenter's film is nearly a rehash of Spielberg's film. Yes, technically the director keeps an attentive eye on his work and his efforts on the camera work, lighting, tightened scenery are palpable with some spooky special effects in the bargain: when the car turns on the radio to play some rock n'roll music of the fifties/sixties or mends itself, it gives goose pimples. But the film is handicapped by a weak scenario which doesn't carry much weight. Take a timid, hung-up teenager named Arnie who is the scapegoat of the riff-Raff of his high-school, make him fall in love with an old car which epitomizes an exit to a sultry familial household, change his behavior and then... Well what to expect? Nearly nothing as soon as we make the acquaintance of the main characters of the film and their various relationships with Arnie and his car. The story is as linear, predictable as one could wish. Hence an absence of dramatic progression. But there's perhaps this ambiguous (and positive) side all the same: is Arnie really in love with ""Christine""? Isn't he rather manipulated by her?And still this tepid music that Carpenter persists in writing. If you want a good dose of shivers with a deadly vehicle, why not doing justice to Spielberg's film?",Christine
14,Quinoa1984,"not either King or Carpenter's best by far, but I didn't mind watching it",8,11 September 2006,"I haven't read Christine by Stephen King, and after seeing the movie it's not on any kind of list of books by the prolific author to seek out anytime too soon. Maybe the book explains things a little more (i.e. great fantastical depth ala Dark Tower), or maybe not. Maybe part of the fun of Christine is to just take on the ride, ho-ho, that a car is possessed right from the assembly line and is almost like a true mechanical incarnation of the twisted, mad woman out for blood in Play Misty For Me and Fatal Attraction. King also has fun, as does John Carpenter, in exploiting the stereotypes of the jocks, the bullies, the hot girls, and of course the losers, most particularly here played by Keith Gordon as Artie Cunningham. Gordon, who can be quite good as a straight-player in 80s movies, most notably in Back to School and Dressed to Kill (the latter in a somewhat similar role), here has to trade off between the helpless nerd and the crazed, over-protective master- or servant perhaps- to his real madam of a car.Carpenter, as usual in his tough-as-nails 80s form, doesn't let things slip much with the style, but there's something else that is sort of 'off' with the film. While I was open to the idea of a horror movie all predicated on a homicidal automobile, which can think and, more often than not, get into rages that end up squeezing itself into a small spot to kill one of its victims in one case, it isn't too scary. For a man coming off of such a hot streak with Halloween and especially the Thing, I wondered how Carpenter must have been able to keep a straight face with some of these set-ups. I did find it watchable for its hokey, OK cast (with Harry Dean Stanton popping in as a detective, always a plus to have him in if only for a bit) and Gordon doing what he can with a demented character, but it didn't draw me in as much with the attitude or real shocks and scares of other films by the director. Part of the problem, also sad to say, is in King's material itself. He mines the basics of the nerd vs bullies struggle of high school movies and stories, and has a bit of a 50s sci-fi serial novel in the back of his head. But it doesn't connect as strongly as it could, or would.Not that Carpenter and King don't at least mine some nice opportunities for some dark humor. It was always funny to hear the 50s rock songs pop up, leading to the final line ""I hate rock'n'roll"" to bring out a really by laugh. And sometimes such moments of meant-to-be-horror come off better as black comedy anyway. It'll probably hit off more for people with a love of old-style cars, and nerd revenge pictures, and it's not a bad match made for an author with such a crazy, creative way of making up stories, with a filmmaker who always takes on stories that are silly but meant to be taken seriously. Christine is slight, goofy, assuredly B-movie contrivance done on a Hollywood scale.",Christine
15,BandSAboutMovies,"Not the best, not the worst",7,26 May 2018,"Christine was not a film John Carpenter had planned on directing, as most of his films were personal projects, not just jobs. But after the poor reception that The Thing received, he needed a project that would jump-start his career. It may not be frightening. But sometimes, you need to make money to live on.Richard Kobritz, who produced Salem's Lot, was given some two unpublished manuscripts from King to consider for their next film adaptation. He chose this one over Cujo, as he felt that story was silly. One was ""Christine"" and the other was ""Cujo."" Korbitz chose Christine because he thought Cujo was too silly.This film was already in production as the book was being published. In its original prose form, it's made clear that the original owner of the car, Roland D. LeBay, is the one possessing it. But in the film, from day one, there's an evil force that powers this 1958 Plymouth Fury (a '57 and two other Plymouth models, the Belvedere and the Savoy, were also used to create the car).That malevolent spirit shows up on the assembly line, when Christine cuts a man's hand off and then kills another worker who dares to ash his cigar on her upholstery.Fast-forward 21 years and Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon, Dressed to Kill) has only one friend - Dennis (John Stockwell, who became a director and helmed Blue Crush, Turistas and Crazy/Beautiful, amongst others). His life gets better when he buys Christine for $250, an action that no one understands.Arnie not only restores the car, he restores himself. Tossing his glasses, he begins to become more arrogant and dresses like a 1950's greaser. That allows him to hook up with the new girl in town, Leigh.Dennis worries about Arnie, so he begins to study the dark past of his car - like how it killed its previous owner and his family. It tries to do the same to Leigh, jealous of anyone who gets close to its owner.After a fight with Arnie leads to him being expelled, Buddy Repperton and his gang completely destroy Christine. As Arnie watches, it comes back to life, repairing itself and hunts the gang down, one by one. There's an incredibly directed scene here where a flaming Christine (obviously this scene influenced the close of The Strangers: Prey at Night) chases Buddy to his death.The murders don't stop there, as Christine even kills Darnell (Robert Protsky, Grandpa Fred from Gremlins 2), the owner of the garage where Arnie fixed up the car. This leads state policeman Rudolph Junkins (Harry Dean Stanton, always a welcome face) to investigate Arnie.Dennis and Leigh try to save Arnie by luring Christine to Darnell's. They think it's just the car coming to battle them, but Arnie is behind the wheel as it crashes, sending him flying through the windshield to his death. They finally get the car into a crusher, but even as it's deposited into a junkyard as a cube, it's already reforming to the tune of ""Bad to the Bone."" If you look close enough, the singer of that song, George Thorogood, is working in the junkyard.There's a lot more that was jettisoned from the book, like how crooked Darnell was, the romance between Leigh and Dennis, Junkins getting killed by Christine and her coming back and hunting down the rest of the gang after she's crushed.There's just enough Carpenter (and a great score alongside frequent collaborator Alan Howarth) to make this movie worthwhile. It's not the best of his films. Nor the best King film. But it's an enjoyable enough way to pass ninesome oddodd minutes.",Christine
16,Coventry,Honk if you like this girl Christine,6,17 August 2004,"I re-watched John Carpenter's adaptation of Stephen King's novel again for the first time in over ten years and it's just as I remember it to be. Not much of a compelling horror film but merely a black comedy and a homage to the typical 50's teenage lifestyle. Carpenter and King seem to share a common interest for the dazzling 50's atmosphere and this perfectly translates itself in `Christine'. First and foremost, there's the beauty of the 1958 Plymouth Fury, a car that almost represents this decade entirely by itself. But also the music, hairstyles and dress codes make you feel like you've landed in the fifties, even though the movie is entirely set and timed in the early 80's.  The nerdish teenager Arnie Cunningham falls head over heels in love with the wreck of a gorgeous car and decides to restore it. Pretty soon, Christine's influence (Christine is the name of the car) makes Arnie go through a complete metamorphosis. Positively, at first, as Arnie impresses girls and turns into an attractive rebel. But it doesn't take that long before he becomes totally obsessive over Christine and starts acting like a psychopath. If you're not expecting an eerie and tense chiller from the creator of `Halloween' and `The Fog', you won't be disappointed. Christine is a totally different kind of horror and not nearly as intense as Carpenter's previous work. I mean, how scary is it to see a wrecked car rebuild itself?? The few exiting scenes featuring in this film are when Christine independently stalks some John Travolta look-alikes who trashed and violated her earlier in the film. Christine should be considered as a fun and well-made satire, with a brilliant golden-oldies soundtrack (watching this film feels like listening to a juke-box) and decent acting performances. Keith Gordon does well as Arnie and Alexandra Paul looks gorgeous as the high-school hottie. Veteran actor Harry Dean Stanton (Alien, The Green Mile) has a tiny role as a police detective. And finally, cinema buffs might recognize Kelly Preston in her meaningless role of cheerleader bimbo.",Christine

A high school kid becomes obsessive in his feelings for a very strange car he has bought. The car is given the name Christine and repays her owner's adoration by ""taking care of"" his enemies.It is fun watching Keith Gordon, owner of Christine, go from wimp to self proclaimed stud.

18,hitchcockthelegend,"No Strawberry Girl, She's Plymouth Fury. CQB 241.",8,5 October 2014,"Christine is directed by John Carpenter and adapted to screenplay by Bill Phillips from the novel of the same name written by Stephen King. It stars Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Carpenter and Alan Howarth and cinematography is by Donald M. Morgan.How Do You Kill Something That Can't Possibly Be Alive?1983 was a busy year for Stephen King adaptations to the screen, along with Christine there was also Cujo and The Dead Zone, so for fans of the legendary author there was plenty to chew on. Christine tells the story of a possessed car that takes over the life of the school nerd, with devastating consequences. As a story that's pretty much all there is to it, the beauty of the pic is how Carpenter ensures the car really does have a malevolent life of its own. The theme at work such as automobile obsession and the bonkers love story at the narrative heart, are not sacrificed for cheap shocks and gimmickry, but Carpenter rightly made the car the star and she doesn't disappoint.Christine's move from being a knackered old banger to super shiny speedster runs concurrent with Arnie Cunningham's (Gordon) transformation. Where once was the misfit being bullied, is now a supremely confident dude, he even dates one of the school babes. But with Christine's love and protection comes great danger, and this lets Carpenter craft some super scenes. From self healing to fiery vengeance, the director brings his lensing skills to the party. Music, unsurprisingly for Carpenter, plays a key part as well. A ream of 50s Rock ""n"" Roll tunes play out of Christine's radio to align with what is unfolding on screen, while the score is distinctly Carpenteresque.Cast are very good in their efforts, though more of the wonderful H. D. Stanton should have been a requisite. Unfortunately the screenplay doesn't afford many character instances to run smoothly, it sometimes feels like the studio demanded that Carpenter hurry up to the next Christine is evil scene instead of building the character bridges! However, it's a film that may be undeniably 80s in tone of film making, but it has aged surprisingly well. Suspenseful, exciting and devilishly playful, this is another Carpenter movie worthy of re-evaluation. 8/10",Christine
19,jotix100,A car to die for,7,13 November 2005,"Never having seen this film, or having read Stephen King's novel, in which ""Christine"" is based on, we decided to take a chance. Needless to say, it paid big time because of the inspired direction by John Carpenter who also composed the background music for the movie. In fact, it was a surprise, perhaps, because of no preconceived ideas on our part.The film is not as much as a horror film, as it is a dark comedy that seems to suit the material Bill Phillips, its adapter, gives to the picture. There are some excellent visual effects that work well within the context of the narrative making the viewer not to lose interest at any given moment.The subject of the film is about a young man who is perceived as a weakling by his peers at school. In fact, just like with another Stephen King novel, ""Carrie"", Arnie Cunningham vows to take revenge in all the nasty things done to him by the bullies in school. In fact, we witness a transformation in Arnie as he becomes interested in restoring the 1957 car he bought second hand and seems to cause a lot of problems for some people who dare to cross Arnie.The film works because of the creepy performance by Keith Gordon, who as Arnie, brings life into the teen ager that goes from being a nerd, easily afraid of his tormentors, into the assured young man who knows about his powers once he is riding his red car. The rest of the cast is good interacting with Mr. Gordon. John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, the great Robert Prosky and Henry Dean Stanton, who doesn't have much to do in the film.This film will be appreciated by all fans of John Carpenter.",Christine
20,Scarecrow-88,Christine,9,9 September 2006,"Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon, who has never been better)finds a junker Plymoth sitting in a yard for sale. It is shown at the opening of the film to have smashed one automaker's hand with it's hood while suffocating another with carbon monoxide. So we know what Arnie doesn't..that this car whose name is Christine isn't your ordinary Plymoth. Something deep within this car is evil and it grips a demonic hold on whoever drives it. Dennis(John Stockwell), a star football player, tries to warn his best friend to not buy this hunk of junk, but Arnie can not resist it's pull. Arnie's parents do not approve of buying it and his resistance towards them begins here. Arnie is shown as sweet and self-deprecating. He is mistreated by three bullies in machine shop, and the leader plans to assault Arnie, and Dennis who takes up for him with a switchblade knife. They take their anger out on Arnie when he and Dennis report them to the autoshop teacher, by destroying Christine..that will be quite a mistake! The film's main conflict, however, is Leigh(Alexandra Paul)..a hottie who becomes Arnie's love interest. She is truthfully Christine's main nemesis other than the thrill bullies for she comes between the car and Arnie. You see, anyone who comes between Christine and her man must be punished.I believe Christine gets better every time I watch it. Now, I know the story and/or idea of a car with demonic powers(..not to mention her hold on whoever is the rightful owner)might be regarded as silly, but there's something so compelling about it. I guess what comes out the creepiest is Keith Gordon's transformation as the film continues. He's so self-deprecating and timid, we love him at the beginning which makes what Christine does to him even more tragic. We watch as he begins to resist his parents(using foul language towards them in defiance;even attack his father), turns away from possible love with Leigh{who deeply cares about him}, barking at those who wish to insult his ""lady"", growing apart from Dennis, and seeing this evil slowly overcome him. We truthfully see what Christine does to those who ""become hers"". The film also shows that she can repair herself after serious damage is inflicted on her. When the gang of bullies smash her to smithereens, Arnie {..by this time almost completely psychopathic}gives her the extra push to reshape her torso so that they could seek revenge towards those who hurt her.Despite it's reputation, the film isn't graphic for Carpenter wishes to ratchet up the suspense instead of bloodying the screen. We watch as Christine chases down each of the three who caused her and Arnie harm and the car's wrath brings on an investigation directed toward Arnie. That detective is played by Harry Dead Stanton.Dennis and Leigh(who both have now realized how evil Christine is thanks to Leigh's near choking death thanks to the evil car)must try and save Arnie before the car destroys him. But, can Arnie be saved? Ultimately, the film is about obsession. Arnie becomes obsessed with Christine and vice versa. But, perhaps Christine finds certain suitors who are weak and need affirmation from someone when life deals them a bad deck. Certainly in Arnie's case, Christine awakens something sinister, though at first he simply gains courage by asking out Leigh and facing overbearing parents. But, by the end we know that the quiet, hurt young man who just wanted more out of life is erased and all that is left is a monster a certain girl created.",Christine
21,Hey_Sweden,"""Watch what you call my car. She's real sensitive.""",7,2 December 2015,"Put upon high school student Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon, in his first feature film lead role) is dominated by his parents, and has basically one friend in the world, level headed jock Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell). Then one day he spies an incredible wreck of a car, a 1958 Plymouth Fury that was named Christine by her foul tempered former owner. Believing he can restore her to prime condition, he now has something to live for. But soon his feelings towards the automobile turn to outright obsession, and he changes for the worse. Meanwhile, the car goes out systematically eliminating anybody who's rubbed Arnie the wrong way.Horror master John Carpenter was, at the time, still smarting from the lack of commercial and critical success suffered by ""The Thing"", which this viewer believes to be his true masterpiece. He agreed to take the helm of this Stephen King adaptation. King, at the time, was such a phenomenon as an author that this story got optioned as a feature before it was even published. King had been impressed enough with producer Richard Kobritzs' TV miniseries of his novel ""Salems' Lot"" to give the man his choice of adaptations, and Kobritz chose this one over ""Cujo"".""Christine"" is very well made, and lots of fun. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Phillips understand completely the love lavished by many on their rolling iron, so this is a pretty decent look at a boy and the car he loves. Carpenter & Phillips drop the more outré elements of the novel, almost completely getting rid of the character of the malevolent spirit Roland D. LeBay, and focusing on the car herself. In this movie version, Christine is born so evil that she's maimed one man and killed another before she's even off the assembly line!Carpenters' moody score is one of his absolute best, and he also gets great use out of ""Harlem Nocturne"" by The Viscounts. The dialogue is often quite profane, but quotable as well. The special effects by Roy Arbogast are most impressive. The scenes of the ruined Christine repairing herself are the definite highlights of the movie.The roles are impeccably cast. Gordon is entertaining to watch as he makes the transition from pathetic dweeb to swaggering '50s style punk. Stockwell and the lovely Alexandra Paul are good as their characters react to the changes in their friend. Robert Prosky, as miserly garage owner Will Darnell, Harry Dean Stanton, as persistent State Police detective Junkins, and Roberts Blossom, as LeBays' crotchety brother George, are all excellent. William Ostrander is spot on as the Travolta-esque creep Buddy Repperton. Stu Charno (""Friday the 13th Part II""), Steven Tash (""Ghost Busters""), and Malcolm Danare (""The Curse"") are a hilariously unlikely bunch of bullies. It's also worth noting that Arnies' unlikable parents are played by CHRISTINE Belford and Robert DARNELL. Just a coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. Most importantly, the car herself really does become a character with a real presence.Building to an exciting finale where Christine meets her match inside Darnells' garage, this is guaranteed to put a smile on some faces.This was the very first feature to use the George Thorogood classic ""Bad to the Bone"" to denote a character that is, well, bad to the bone.Seven out of 10.",Christine
22,preppy-3,John Carpenter has done better--and worse,6,12 June 2006,"The story takes place in 1978. Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a nerd in high school. Kids pick on him and his parents treat him rotten. His only friend is (inexplicably) a handsome jock named Dennis (John Stockwell). Arnie discovers Christine--a beat up 1957 Plymouth Fury. He buys it--unaware that previous owners have died in the car. The car starts to possess him--turning him into a handsome, confident but amoral guy--and Christine will kill anybody who tries to stop them...OK--the Stephen King book wasn't great. It was basically a short story dragged out to a novel. Unfortunately that's the problem with the movie--it's a good 90 minute film dragged out to almost 2 hours. This film is also woefully miscast in the lead role. Gordon was a good actor in the right parts--but this isn't it. He's believable as the nerd but not as the evil guy he becomes. Also the change happens way too quick (and off screen). The rest of the cast however is good--Stockwell is very handsome and believable and Paul is beautiful and quite good despite the fact that she is given NO characterization. Also Christine's evil is never explained--it is in the book but not here.On the plus side this movie portrays its teenage characters believably (even though Gordon, Stockwell and Paul are obviously in their 20s). It is well-directed with a good music score and a well-chosen collection of oldies. The special effects of Christine repairing herself are still impressive too. If you're thinking of watching this for blood and gore, forget it--there's no gore and very little blood. However there is TONS of swearing.I loved this in 1983 but found it slow and too long now. Not a disaster but it could have been better. I'm giving it a 6.",Christine
23,poolandrews,"""If you want to fart you go out in the junk yard."" Very silly Stephen King adaptation.",5,5 September 2005,"Christine starts in 'Detroit, 1957' where a brand new red Plymouth Fury rolls off the production line, as a mechanic works on it his fingers become trapped as the bonnet shuts on them & in another incident later on that day a man is found dead in the front... The film informs us that it's 'Rockbridge, California September 12 1978' & Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is your average typical school nerd complete with dorky spectacles & who gets picked on by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) & his gang of mates. While driving home from school one day with his best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) he notices a beat up car for sale, a red Plymouth Fury. After talking with the cars owner George LeBay (Roberts Blossom) Arnie decide to buy it & fix it up himself at a do-it-yourself garage run by the overweight foul-mouthed Will Darnell (Robert Prosky). Within a few weeks the car which is now known as Christine is as good as new & Arnie has undergone a transformation, he is now confident, doesn't wear geeky glasses anymore & is dating Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul), one of the prettiest girls in school. Then Arnie changes even more, he becomes selfish, forgets about his old friends, he becomes aggressive & uncaring as Christine takes over his life. When Buddy & his gang smash Christine up Arnie & Christine set out for revenge...Directed by John Carpenter I really didn't think too much of Christine as a whole, although certain aspects show the idea had promise & potential. Christine was in fact based on a novel by Stephen King & was one of three King adaptations in '83, the other's were David Cronenberg's thriller The Dead Zone (1983) & Lewis Teague's rabid dog horror Cujo (1983), King was so popular at this point that the film Christine apparently went into production before the book Christine was published. The script was written by Bill Phillips & I have to admit right now that I have not read King's book that Christine is based upon, it's only been a few hours since I finished watching it & all I can think about is how silly a premise it is. I mean a possessed car that can rebuild itself? Quite why Christine is possessed & by whom or what I don't know as the film never explains this which is odd considering that in my opinion it's a pretty important aspect to the plot. Christine is a little on the slow side too with not much happening during the first half of the film while Buddy & his gang sometimes feel at odds with the rest of the film & only ever appear to either be antagonists or to be killed off as they otherwise get no screen time. Apart from Buddy & co. the character's in Christine are actually very well developed & surprisingly I found myself liking & caring for them from the beat upon nerd Arnie & the cool cop Rudolph Junkins (Harry Dean Stanton) to the funny foul-mouthed Darnell, some really good acting also helps. I was also pleasantly surprised to find an original film for a change & something just a bit different, I don't think I've seen another film quite like it anyway. Technically Christine is polished, with a supposed budget of about $9,700,000 it's certainly well made with some great special effects when Christine rebuilds herself & a cool ending scene with Christine against a Bulldozer. The cinematography is fine, the synthesiser type music reminds heavily of Halloween (1978) & the production design is nice enough. Director Carpenter creates some good sequences especially as a flame covered Christine hunts Buddy down chasing him & eventually running him over. There is no gore or violence really, a burning body & a broken slither of glass in someone's stomach, that's it. The acting is strong throughout which helps bring the character's to life. While Christine isn't exactly a brilliant film, it's slow & very silly, it entertained to an extent & at least it tries to be different & have strong character's. Hard to recommend but I think Christine has some merits that unfortunately are lost within & outweighed by it's negative aspects, worth a watch for King & horror fans alike but everyone else should probably give it a miss I'm afraid.",Christine
24,Bunuel1976,Christine (1983) **1/2,6,9 March 2006,"This film's reputation as being John Carpenter's first misstep after an enviable run of outstanding films he made between 1974 and 1982 has kept me away from it until now. Or maybe it's because I'm not too keen on cars  I don't drivesomething which has also kept me away from, for example, Monte Hellman's TWO LANE BLACKTOP (1971)! Anyway, while CHRISTINE definitely falls short of reaching the heights of Carpenter's best work or, for that matter, the other Stephen King movie adaptations which had been made until then, like CARRIE (1976), THE SHINING (1980) and THE DEAD ZONE (1983), it remains a skillfully mounted and reasonably entertaining ride.After a précis of Christine's antics in the past, the films starts out almost like a male version of CARRIE with the nerdy Keith Gordon  fresh from a similar role in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL (1980)  getting picked on by his schoolmates among whom, incidentally, is a John Travolta-lookalike! However, his transformation into a slick ladies' man and, later still, a vengeful, nihilistic, self-destructive wreck of a man, all seemingly under Christine's evil influence, comes off as rather too rushed and somewhat unconvincing.To counter this, however, three supporting roles are vividly brought to life by consummate character actors: Robert Prosky as the foul-mouthed, unsympathetic garage owner, Roberts Blossom as the seedy brother of Christine's original ill-fated owner who sells the ravaged car to the hapless Gordon and Harry Dean Stanton who makes a belated appearance as the investigating officer of the sudden outburst of teen killings. While the ending where Christine is crushed at the hands of Gordon's best friend is well-staged, I was disappointed that Stanton did not participate in it in any way and as such his part becomes somewhat redundant given that we know from the outset what is behind the murders! The sequences depicting the elaborate attacks perpetrated by Christine are the best in the film, particularly the choking of Gordon's girlfriend, the cornering and crushing of the fat guy in a desolate alley and, above all, the spectacular garage explosion and subsequent chasing/mauling of Buddy by the fiery Christine. Also, Christine's automatic recreations after each beating, not to mention its ""breathing"" at the very end, are decidedly creepy.",Christine
25,utgard14,"""You better watch what you say about my car. She's real sensitive.""",8,7 September 2015,"John Carpenter's excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novel about a nerdy teenager (Keith Gordon) who buys a ragged old '58 Plymouth named Christine and immediately falls in love with it. He works tirelessly on restoring the car, all the while undergoing subtle change to his appearance and behavior. Not all of these changes are good ones and it soon becomes apparent that Christine has a supernatural hold over 'her' new owner and will do anything to keep him all to 'herself.'Christine was one of the first Stephen King books I read back in the day. I enjoyed the novel a lot and I enjoy the film version just as much, if not more so. I'm a big fan of John Carpenter and I think this is one of his more under-appreciated efforts. His talent and style go a long way towards making what is, at its heart, a simple ""B"" horror movie into something more polished and effective. Good direction, music, and special effects. The scenes where Christine goes on the attack are exciting and well-staged. The cast is great, with Keith Gordon giving a standout performance in the lead and John Stockwell doing an admirable job as his best friend. Alexandra Paul is lovely to look at and makes the most of her thin role. A young and gorgeous Kelly Preston is also in this in a small part. This is not one of Carpenter's best but it is very good and it's certainly one of the better adaptations of King's work brought to the big screen. Definitely one that fans of either man will want to see.",Christine

The movie simply becomes a vigilante movie, and then a standard action movie (just with a car being the bad guy!).

27,Boba_Fett1138,Stuck somewhere between liking it and really liking it.,8,24 June 2012,"This movie definitely is not a perfect horror classic but I still see it somewhat as a semi-classic. Because of its unique story it still remains a very special and unique one, that besides works out really well, for most part.Thing that this movie really has going for it is its originality. The main concept might even sound a bit ridicules and just far from likely. I mean, a car with an own mind, that kills off people? That does not sound like anything too convincing of course. But it does work out well in the movie and its story, probably also because it does not ever over-explain anything. The car is evil, as simple as that. There is no reason for it given and the characters in the movie also don't try to find out how and why the car has a true mind of her own. I guess that by trying to give an explanation for all of it, the movie would had truly become a ridicules and far fetched one to watch, so it in my opinion was the right choice to simply step over it and just take things for granted. It also kept the movie at all times simple and pleasant to watch and also adds to the movie its mystery and tension as well.It's definitely true that all of the movie its 'fun' starts in its last hour. Before that point, the movie is really taking its time, by setting up certain story lines and characters. Not that it's bad or boring to watch all but once the fun kicks in and the final hour starts you are still nevertheless wondering to yourself if the movie couldn't had picked up its pace earlier on already and started off a bit sooner with its horror elements.It are little storytelling elements like this that prevent the movie from being a true great one. But all of this can be brought back to the fact that it's based on a novel, which often features and also requires a totally different way of storytelling of course. It's also the main reason why some characters work out awkwardly in this movie and too often get pushed to the background. It doesn't always feels like a well balanced movie with its storytelling and characters.Also some of its themes could had been handled better and more effective, in the movie. Such as for instance the whole way the car chances its owner's personality could had been done far more subtle and interestingly. It could had also given the movie some more depth but this is just not the type of movie that ever wants to delve too deep into things. It's clearly made as foremost a genre movie and to entertaining and bring some thrills to its audience.And it does not really fail as a genre movie. The car pretty much becomes a real character for the movie and it's being a pretty effective 'villain', mostly thanks to the way the movie got shot by genre expert John Carpenter, who directed the movie.Depite all of its flaws and weaknesses, I'm still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and call this a semi-classic because of its original concept and the way it got shot by John Carpenter. Also when looking at it fairly you have to conclude that it's being a way better and more effective movie than just the average genre attempt.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Christine
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not Carpenter's best, but pretty good",7,28 June 2004,"Let me make this clear right away: I haven't read the book, nor do I intend to. You won't find any comparisons between the book and the film in this review. This film combines two of the biggest names in horror from two different medias; Stephen King is pretty much legendary for his written horror work. John Carpenter is also a pretty well-known name, but as a horror director rather than writer. Having not read the book, I have no idea how true Carpenter stayed to the source material, but I can understand from various sources that he changed a lot, and the changes were very big, so fans of the book might not like the movie. Whenever I hear about a film being made that is based on a King novel my response is usually that of someone who lacks any interest in it whatsoever. When I hear that it's directed by John Carpenter, one of my favorite directors, particularly within the horror genre, I develop an interest. Carpenter does a great job of turning something as potentially lame and goofy as a possessed car into something that you really fear. I was at the edge of my seat for a lot of the scenes, and I jumped at several shocking moments. The story revolves around a nerd buying a car, and the car significantly changing his personality. He changes enormously throughout the film, and I must say, the actor does a great job of capturing the emotion of the character. The plot is great, it doesn't move along very fast, but rather deliberately slow, building up atmosphere, building to a climax that is every bit as exciting as the build-up promises. The acting is great, especially by Keith Gordon, who portrays the nerd-like Arnie, who buys the demonic car. The film has pretty much the same sense of humor that Carpenter's films usually have, albeit slightly less of it is present than in several of his others, less serious films. The special effects are very good, they are almost impossible to tell. Had I not known better, I could have sworn that they were real. They probably could be more well-made had they been done today, but I still think it's amazing how real they look. They don't look the least bit dated. All in all, a good Carpenter film that probably won't be to everyones liking. I recommend it to fans of Carpenter, and fans of atmospheric horror films in general. 7/10",Christine
29,view_and_review,Road Rage Unleashed,8,15 June 2014,"Stephen King was on to something. We call that something ""road rage"" nowadays but maybe that's not really what it is. I mean, how do you explain relatively good-natured people getting behind the wheel of a car and becoming stark raving lunatics. Road rage is a misdiagnosis. It's Christine. There are thousands, if not millions, of Christines out there.Christine was a '58 Plymouth Fury that was refurbished in '78 for a movie released in '83 that I watched for the first time in '14. The main character, Arnold, bought Christine as a bucket of bolts and began nursing her back to health. As Christine changed so did Arnie. He went from the high school dweeb to a world class D-bag in a matter of days.The movie was terrific. Stephen King wrote about something that's very relevant. A guy having a love affair with his car and the car turning him into a madman... that happens all of the time! The special effects were pretty awesome for 1983 and the acting was good. Christine featured a poor man's Johnny Travolta in William Ostrander however old he was playing a high schooler. The acting was good, nothing to brag about, but good. I can see why this movie is so often referenced.",Christine
30,neil-476,"Not bad, not bad at all",7,5 October 2009,"Stephen King has had much of his output adapted to the big screen. Frank Darabont's three King movies are glowing exceptions to the standards of most of these adaptations, which have varied from barely adequate down to appalling (and I include Kubrick's The Shining in the latter category - as an adaptation, it stinks).John Carpenter's Christine is another honourable exception.King's story of a Plymouth Fury which is displaying its (never explained) malevolence before it has even rolled off the assembly line may well be one of his lesser works, but it is still populated with real people and is carefully constructed, even to the first person narration from Dennis (the film does not use Dennis as narrator, but it shows a lot of what happens from Dennis' point of view).The story is tragic in that Artie, carefully constructed to be a victim in his pre-Christine world, is destined to be destroyed by Christine from the moment she gets her claws into him, even though he goes through a period of illusory apparent non-victimhood before being lost (in similar fashion to Jack Torrance being consumed by The Overlook).Carpenter does a solid job of picking up most of the novel's beats and delivering them in slick, atmospheric fashion. The cast - largely unknown at the time - does an excellent job of bringing the characters to life, particularly Keith Gordon who conveys pre-Christine Arnie's nerdiness, post-Christine Arnie's single minded obsessiveness, and the transition from one to the other, all with complete believability.A tolerable job is carried out in using mechanical effects (and film run backwards!) to convey the fact that Christine has a life of her own.And the movie contains one of THOSE moments, you know, the ones which make the hair on the back of your neck stand up, when Arnie says ""Show me"", Christine's lights come on, and the music delivers a creepy downwards glissando.",Christine
31,AlsExGal,An effective horror film with a car as femme fatale,7,9 December 2017,"This is John Carpenter's film version of the Stephen King bestseller about an evil car. The film's namesake, a bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury, doesn't even make it off the assembly line before maiming and killing people. Cut to the present, and awkward, clumsy high school nerd Arnie Cunningham and his jock best friend Dennis. Arnie is a total social failure, the target of bullies and totally ignored by the girls. On the way home, he spots the decrepit wreck of the '58 Fury, and he's instantly obsessed. He buys the car, despite the protests of his friend and parents, and starts working to restore it in a large garage complex owned by the loathsome Darnell. As Arnie spends more and more time with Christine, as he's named the car, his entire persona changes from the sweet, if dorky, nerd to someone more confident and dangerous. And while he's now dating Leigh, the hottest girl in school, his heart truly lies with Christine. And Christine has a mind of her own...This is one of the better King adaptations, and Carpenter's excellent camera-work and pacing keep the film moving along even through the rough patches. His usual great synth scoring works well too, but will no doubt bother some viewers. There are lots of vintage rock hits on the soundtrack, as well. The cast is good, led by Keith Gordon as Arnie and John Stockwell as his worried best bud. Alexandra Paul is fetching, if a little wooden, as Leigh. Roberts Blossom has a great cameo as the disturbing former owner. But it's Robert Prosky, a veteran stage and screen supporting player, who steals every scene he's in as the grotesque Darnell. The great Harry Dean Stanton has a small bit as a cop, too, although his role goes nowhere. William Ostrander, a John Travolta lookalike, plays the lead high school bully, despite looking 35. Look out for Kelly Peston in an early role as another student. Incidentally, both male leads, Gordon and Stockwell, have gone on to successful directing careers in film and television.The scene of the unstoppable car, engulfed in flames as it slowly closes in on a victim on a deserted road at night, is one the better images in horror films of the time.",Christine

His best friend tries to dissuade him, but he doesn't listen, and the once sheepish boy transforms into a confident(and vengeful) man, courtesy of Christine, who wants him all to herself, and murders all those(including the school bullies who tormented him) who stand in the way.Though well acted and even directed, film is curiously ineffective, with few scares and little suspense. Though Arnie's transformation is the most striking thing about it, and the F/X are also impressive, film just misses, though is still watchable for old car lovers who may get a kick out of it!",Christine
33,FlashCallahan,she's real sensitive...,5,26 February 2011,"Arnie Cunningham is a typical high school nerd who is picked on, overruled by his parents, and has very few friends.

This is very light on scares and thrills, but manages to retain that Carpenter feel his movies have. The cast are good for what they do in the film, and they deliver the cheesy script with a certain aplomb.but it just doesn't come out of second gear and despite some standout sequences (the burning Christine chasing after one of the vandals quietly down a road)it gets a little bit boring after a while.",Christine
34,Aaron1375,Cars just aren't scary to me.,3,19 March 2003,"Yes, when I think horror, cars are the last things I think of.  This movie has a nerdy guy buying and restoring a car that is cursed.  The car kind of rubs off on the guy and he becomes more popular and stuff, he also becomes obsessed with the car.  We find out that not only does the car have a curse...it also can repair itself and chase after and hit people.  That is about the gist of it...this movie is probably better than it should be thanks to John Carpenter's touches to it.  He does set up a good mood and I like the way the car's radio always would start playing music to fit the moment.  Other than that though, I just didn't enjoy the movie all that much...in fact I thought it was a bit boring.

35,Wuchakk,Killing machine,8,15 September 2014,"I haven't seen every movie based on a Stephen King novel but""Christine"" is one of my favorites of the ones I have seen, along with ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Mist."" The story revolves around a group of teenagers in Southern California (where the film was shot). Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a geeky student with a jock best friend who looks out for him (John Stockwell), especially when he's picked-on at school. After Arnie buys a beat-up '58 Plymouth Fury and fixes it up he slowly starts to change. At first, the changes are good as he starts dating the new cute girl at school (Alexandra Paul), but things take a dark turn when Arnie goes after his abusers.As with most King movies the story takes place in a small town and there's a comic book air to the proceedings and, of course, something supernatural and dark. This is a great teenager/school movie as the social dynamics ring true with slight exaggerations. William Ostrander stands out as Arnie's hoodlum nemesis at school, Buddy. Ostrander resembles a young John Travolta and would've been perfect to play Wolverine (in the 80s and early 90s anyway).Memorable scenes abound highlighted by Christine's stunning attack on the hoodlums at a gas station, the ensuing chase and Christine's supernatural restoration. Stockwell's great as Arnie's best friend and Gordon is excellent as the protagonist turned antagonist. What I mean by that is that the viewer's sympathy is with Arnie in the first act and we celebrate with him in the second act as Christine (the car) gives him the push into cool-ness he needed, not to mention the gonads to stand up for himself. But Christine's malevolence takes over in the last act and, well, you know.""Christine"" ranks well with best teenager/youth films, horror-tinged or otherwise, like ""The Rage: Carrie 2"" and ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""The film runs 110 minutes.GRADE: A-",Christine
36,The_Void,A minor success for Stephen King,8,7 September 2005,"Adaptations of Stephen King books tend to be disappointing; a bit like films directed by John Carpenter, so I guess this production was doomed from the start. With their previous form in mind, it came as a big surprise to me that this collaboration between King and Carpenter not only doesn't disappoint, but is actually quite good! The story is pure kitsch, and it follows a dorky young kid who falls instantly in love with a 1958 Plymouth Fury, and quickly buys it - against the better judgement of his parents and best friend. It isn't long before our hero is impressing the ladies with his new car...but Christine doesn't take well to competition. It's hard to take this sort of plot line seriously, but, for a change, Carpenter makes good of it through use of original music, the American style and some really nifty special effects. The songs used in the film create just the right mood, and help the story to cement itself in the latter half of the 1970's. The way that old 50's songs are played during the darker scenes is very eerie, and this provides the film with it's main selling point.Naturally, egomaniac John Carpenter has lavished his own trademarks on the story, and those provide much of the reason why this film can't be considered much more than 'good'. His original score isn't up to much, and just like it would do in the likes of Assault on Precinct 13 and Prince of Darkness; the score kills much of the tension. My major gripe with Carpenter is the fact that all of his films have a very dumbed down, horror for kids sort of feel; and this one does too. In that respect, aside from a few scenes - it's hard to really call this horror. When compared to modern horror directors the likes of Dario Argento et al, Carpenter just doesn't cut it. While Argento will make his films scary through his use of the camera and atmosphere - Carpenter merely films the screenplay. Like most of his oeuvre, Christine is patronising for the adult audience it is supposedly aimed at; but on the other hand, the aspects that work do outweigh Carpenter's shortfalls in the directorial talent department, and this still represents a minor success for Stephen King's list of film credits.",Christine
37,Sylviastel,Don't make Christine mad!,8,13 May 2014,"This is one of Stephen King's early horror film adaptations about a possessed car named Christine. Keith Gordon was brilliant as awkward nerdy Arnie Cunningham whose best friend is the high school quarterback. After being bullied in shop, he finds his dream car which is 1957 Plymouth Fury in need of work and a macabre history of death. Arnie's parents refuse to let the piece of junk in their driveway. Arnie parks the car at Darnell's garage. Darnell hates the car but so does everybody else. More and more, Arnie changes too with the car, his beloved Christine, that he cares for so much. When the bullies destroy the car, she shows her power. If anything, I would like to know how Christine came to be a demon possessed. This film is a good adaptation of King's novel.

38,mm-39,People don't kill people! Cars kill people!,7,17 February 2020,"People don't kill people! Cars kill people! True If the Car is evil and a killing machine like Christine! John Carpenter does a good interpretation of King's book Christine. Good background for the story of the town geek, nerd, who is picked on at high school aka Arnie . Everyone knew a guy like Arnie; it was sad! The audience has a sympathetic character Arnie who is lucky to have a couple good friend which help out aka Leigh and Dennis. Carpenter creates a great foundation for solid story . A gang of friend and the other high school clicks. Un-like most under dog stories of today King and Carpenter have a twist! The car feels Arnies weakness and calls Arnie to her. There is warning about the car's past and death follows. Yes the town bullies are bad, and want to keep Arnie down, but Arnie evokes her and becomes more evil and refuses to listen to his caring friends. A car on a terror with an understanding of Arnie who likes being strong and is not pushed around anymore goes into the evil world of Carpenters directing. Effects, mixed with music creates Carpenter horror style feel of the car from hell. Like Halloween and The Thing the Car creeps, hunts, as we have many accidents as the body counts keeps rolling up. The speedometer goes down as the car repairs itself, with a plot twist and a final show down for an exciting story. Will the lead characters who meet Christine in a final show down survive? A good adaptation of King's work. 7 stars.",Christine
39,Mr-Fusion,Off the assembly line and on the warpath,7,11 October 2011,"John Carpenter's ""Christine"", a movie about a homicidal car, naturally hinges on one's ability to suspend disbelief and accept that a car has a mind of its own. On the other hand, this is a John Carpenter film, and that's not a tall order.It's a simple premise: kid falls in love with car, car possesses kid, people start dying. In this case, it's a pitiful loser named Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon). You know the kind: stringbean, doesn't have the guts to ask out a pretty girl, gets kicked around by the jocks. He's got two patronizing parents and a best friend since childhood (John Stockwell), but the chance meeting with a disintegrating rustbucket named Christine (a once gorgeous '58 Plymouth Fury) changes Arnie's life forever. Arnie has no idea his dream car is possessed and has killed since before it even left the assembly line. And Christine is a vengeful lover. When the bodies of the school bullies start piling up, a State Police detective (Harry Dean Stanton) comes snooping, and things grow dim for Arnie and his best girl.Carpenter has a knack for building a mystery around the car, as well as a general sense of foreboding whenever she's on screen. Coupled with the downward spiral of a hapless loser like Arnie Cunningham, that's what makes this a great psychological thriller. You know the damn thing's evil and you keep wondering when she'll strike. Keep's you on edge. It takes a while for Christine to get rolling, but once she does, you can't help but watch. Just seeing a car wage a war of revenge makes for a highly watchable experience.Keith Gordon is perfect for the main character. He's able to convincingly portray both a high school doormat, and an uncaring d-bag once possessed. And it's some kind of law of physics that when Harry Dean Stanton shows up, the film just gets better and better. It also doesn't hurt that ""Christine"" features both Kelly Preston and Alexandra Paul in their teen years. Nope, not one bit.7/10",Christine
40,christopher-underwood,Obsession for the car and later of the car with some stunning and exciting effects,9,28 February 2020,"I enjoyed this far more than I expected to, realising early on I had never seen it before. I have to have been put off by imagining the whole film some sort of ode to a phantom car prowling the streets in search of victims. Probably because I had imagined it a horror film which it really isn't, despite some horrific moments. I could do without the bullying and ancient schoolboys at the start but we are soon clear and on to the matter in hand. This seems to be much more of a coming of age movie that becomes something of a thriller. I love the music, cannily done that, for with the film set in the 70s and the car of the 50s, we get rock 'n' roll from those decades instead of the 80s and whilst we still have to put up with the big hair its a small price to pay. Obsession for the car and later of the car with some stunning and exciting effects regarding its various mishaps along the way. Good performances all round, solid and focused direction with splendid soundtrack. Excellent.",Christine
41,Smells_Like_Cheese,Keith Gordan and John Stockwell shine in this classic horror movie,8,14 November 2003,"Ah, do I remember the day that I saw Christine, which is disturbing since I was only 6 years old, but my sister said ""Do you wanna watch Christine?"" and I was confused, my name is Kristine, but she told me about this little horror movie and thanks to her I couldn't go near our family car for a few months. This is a movie that has always stayed with me and still scares the heck out of me when I watch it in the dark. Who knew that even before taking a driver's ed class that cars could scare me? But this isn't just any ordinary car, this is a killer car! This is a car with ghosts in it and you wouldn't like them if you make them angry or try to take their owner away. Christine is the car that you definitely don't wanna mess with, otherwise you may have to face those bright lights and loud rock and roll music, what happens next, you may not wanna know.Arnie Cunningham, a typical high school nerd with only one friend, a childhood companion named Dennis Guilder, a popular jock. Arnie's life begins to change when he discovers Christine, a red 1958 Plymouth Fury in serious need of repair. Arnie begins to restore Christine to her original beauty, but as he spends more and more of his time repairing her, those in his life notice that he is changing as well. Formerly shy, Arnie develops a cocky arrogance. Dennis, as well as Arnie's new girlfriend Leigh, discover that the car has a deadly past. The previous owner, Roland LeBay, became consumed with Christine and he paid for it with his life. Leigh and Dennis try to save Arnie from a similar fate. They realize that the only way to save Arnie is by destroying Christine. Christine, however, isn't ready to give up Arnie without a fight.Christine is a classic horror movie that for me will always deliver on the good scares. I still have a hard time watching it. I think the scariest scene for me will always be the last scene where Leigh and Dennis face off with Christine and you see that Arnie just completely gone. I'm honestly shocked that Keith Gordon didn't continue on with his acting career, he just blew me away as Arnie, reading the book I couldn't picture anybody else. He's absolutely incredible. John Stockwell also pulls in a good solid performance as well. This is one of the rare horror movies that is over all very enjoyable and if it doesn't scare you, I still think you will like it, it has a great story and a very good cast and crew. I highly recommend that you see this movie if you get the chance, it's a classic.8/10",Christine
42,MovieAddict2016,"A savage statement on how possessors become the possessed, or merely another stupid horror-thriller? You decide.",6,14 August 2006,"This film, based on a novel by Stephen King, focuses on a nerdy teenage boy in high school who comes into possession of a bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury - a car which, at first, he is merely impressed by, but which soon begins to overtake every aspect of his life, ultimately making itself the owner of him and altering his personality into that of an arrogant, mean-spirited jerk.The message isn't too subtle - it's a comment on how humans often become possessed by their possessions. We love our cars, or our entertainment systems, or any aspect of our lives, and soon they begin to control us.But I'm not sure it totally works. The message isn't subtle, as I mentioned above - it's just a bit too obvious and direct. And although it has strong moments, a good deal of the material simply turns into standard horror-thriller moments - anything you'd find in another King novel.King really likes the idea of evil cars for some reason - he went on to write ""From a Buick 8"" later on in his career. You know you've got some type of obsession (or you're running out of ideas) when you write two separate novels about killer cars.But despite its lack of subtlety, I found this to be an entertaining enough movie. Although it caters towards the typical shocker/jump moments all horror films from the '80s had, it's also quite original as far as far as concepts go. Until ""From a Buick 8"" is made into a movie, it's probably the only film you're going to find where an evil, demonic car tries to kill someone.",Christine

And I have to admit that I love this car -- I would still love to have a car like this but I'm not sure if I want a possessed version of it like Christine.The movie is about a nerdy young man named Arnie and his best friend Dennis finds a beat-up old 1958 Plymouth Fury. Dennis is not all that crazy about the car but Arnie falls in love with it. Arnie fixes up the car an turns it into real beauty but there is something very different about this car - and something very different about Arnie after Christine is restored to glory.

44,sddavis63,Typical Stephen King Stuff That Works,6,15 July 2001,"I happened to come across this movie quite by accident on a lazy Saturday afternoon and found it surprisingly interesting.The plot is rather outlandish (but then again, this is Stephen King!) Christine is a car with a definite mind of her own, and she has a tendency to get violently jealous of anyone who takes her owner's attention away from her. Bought for $200 by Arnie Cunningham (played by Keith Gordon, who I am not particularly familiar with but who I thought did a decent job in this role), Christine begins to change him. Previously a nerd whose parents were obsessed with not wanting him to grow up, Arnie suddenly becomes ""cool,"" attracting both a beautiful girlfriend (Leigh, played by Alexandra Paul) and the wrath of the school toughs. Christine, of course, objects to Leigh, and takes revenge against the toughs for Arnie.What can I say? Totally ludicrous, but a lot of fun to watch. And some serious issues along the way. The dangers of jealousy for one. The value of friendship for another. It kept my attention for two hours.I'd rate it as a 6/10.",Christine
45,thesar-2,Somewhat Bad to the Bone,4,2 August 2009,"Boy, King loves his demonic vehicles ('From a Buick 8,' 'Maximum Overdrive,' 'Trucks') and his high school chums vs. bully stories ('Stand By Me,' 'It,' 'Carrie.') Here, 'Christine' was a prelude to the rest, it seems. Despite coming out 26 years ago, this is my first viewing and, though crazed/ghost cars aren't my thing, I gave it a shot. And it was worth a single viewing. Good, but not entirely great, and even at its time, seemed a little stale and clichéd. They did, however, have decent special effects as the car rebuilds itself. That was one of the things I did find weird: If it could do that, why not the first few times it seemed headed to the dump in the first half, i.e. why wait until the audience finally finds out she's more than a piece of metal? It's probably more explained in the book (of which, I haven't read) as Stephen King loves to write chapters on single subjects. Most likely, it was used for tension, fear, I suppose. Arnie spots a car already labeled as a mysterious entity in the opening production line and has to have it, despite objections from his best friend, soon-to-be girlfriend and parents. Supposedly, the car changes the owner into someone spiteful and eventually consumes their life into caring for it. Basically, it's one jealous machine. My problem is, though I do see Arnie growing darker as the film progresses, he wasn't a great individual to begin with. So, there wasn't too much to root for. And his girlfriend really cares for him, when in reality, it was the confidence the car gave him that she must've been attracted to. So, that, too, was unbelievable. Nevertheless, it's worth viewing for die-hard King fans as its contains classic King signature traits.Side Note: With 'Jaws,' aside from just not going in the water, it would be harder to get away (or swim) from the shark. Here, it's painfully obvious how to avoid this evil-Bumble Bee demon. For instance, a character's blocked in a shallow dead end alley, and the car pushes its way into slicing the person in half when he could have simply jumped on the car and out the other side. And another character simply runs down the middle of the street away from it? The obvious John Travolta-wannabe (Copy Cat Carrie, will you?) might have just laid a trail of lug nuts down to direct the killer machine.",Christine
46,gridoon,Simple and straightforward.,6,28 August 1999,"Simple, straightforward adaptation of Stephen King's novel doesn't quite take off, but keeps your interest throughout, mostly because it's directed in a clear, precise style by Carpenter. There is almost no gore in the movie, so those who seek gore should try something else.",Christine
47,lost-in-limbo,Love is more than chrome-laden deep.,8,27 July 2009,"Probably not rated as one of John Carpenter's best (more so middle ground) but I thought otherwise as it's definitely my second favorite (just after 1982 remake of ""The Thing"") of his long-listed horror output. Yep I put it ahead of his influential 1978 slasher 'Halloween'.Anyhow Carpenter did a seductively low-key and restraint job with this Steven King adaptation, by streamlining it with hypnotic visuals (like the flaming car) and getting able performances from his cast. Keith Gordon and John Stockwell make for a likable pairing, and watching Gordon's character's compelling transformation is convincingly staged from the once placid dweeb to an obsessively psychotic controller that goes on to hurt those who care for him. It's big change in attitude with a downfall spiral that sees him not going back. The basic plot might get on the silly side and move on too suddenly, but Carpenter keeps our affection towards the purring red and white 1958 Plymouth fury and its strangle hold over Arnie (a worthy Gordon). Total infatuation. In the end I liked how it just didn't focus on revenge with it weaving in elements of humane qualities involving teenage angst, rebellion and love. A well told story.Carpenter confidently straight-up direction (which is far from stylish or slick) passionately lets the possessed car take over with its own vivid personality and just listen to those swinging 50s rock 'n roll tunes. This car does feel like if it had a mind of its own! Atmosphere is little and while there's a real sinister nastiness lurking underneath it never really shows, to only take place in off-screen shocks. He tries building suspense (mainly those scenes involving Arnie getting revenge on some punk bullies), where it sometimes works and if it didn't it still had the mesmerizing imagery. Watching the car get torn apart in scenes, to only repair itself was eye-candy (if haunting) and it finishes on a bone rattler of a climax. The music score was another interesting touch, quite spaced-out but rippling in affect and Donald Morgan's cinematography held a crafty edge.Rounding off the cast was a solid Stockwell, a reasonably modest Alexandra Paul and a perfectly gruff Robert Prosky. Buddy Repperton was right on the mark as the main goon picking on Arnie. In smaller roles were the reliable Harry Dean Stanton and an early appearance by Kelly Preston. Christine Belford shows up as Arnie's strict, but concerned mother. Also appearing is Roberts Blossom.What can I say  Christine is number one in my eyes.",Christine
48,ElMaruecan82,"If a boy's best friend is his mother, a boy's best lover might be his car...",8,19 October 2018,"So they can say what they want about a brand new car being the finest smell in the world... after a woman (that's for the synecdoche), Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) make these two certitudes converge in a performance that both channels Norman Bates and foreshadows Private Pyle except that Arnie's 'Charlene' was a car, Christine was her name and Stephen King her creator. And if John Carpenter's adaptation has the body of an 80s teenage horror flick, its engine is a fascinating study on the strange attraction between a man and his car.Indeed, seldom do movies approach fetishism with such a pervert sensitiveness. ""Christine"" is a nightmare on wheels yet we're drawn to HER power (no way I wouldn't treat her like a person). Gene Siskel nailed it the best when he said it's something we wish it could exist or happen, except not to us. And the reason we might wish it could happen is because Carpenter's directing and Gordon's acting make it feel real and oddly attractive. I felt the power of the autumn-red 1957 Plymouth Fury because I could ""feel"" Arnie. And that transferring process reminded me of another classic movie with a villainous vehicle: Steven Spielberg's debut ""Duel"".Remember, the black truck was monstrous enough but you had a better taste of its vileness from the stressful state of Dennis Weaver. ""Christine"" works on the same level except that it both shows the terror of the victims (or targets) and the soul-abandonment of Arnie. Call me crazy but the encounter between Arnie and Christine's owner George LeBay (Roberts Blossom) features what I consider one of the most unforgettable love-at-first-sight moments ever and yes, it involves a guy... and a car. And the reason why the chemistry seems to work is that the two lovers (and life partners) had their establishing-moments.Thinking about it again, Carpenter played it exactly like a romance where you first meet the two separately before the pivotal moment where Cupid throws the arrow. Arnie isn't even born when Christine comes in all shining red from its assembly line, she has not even been driven that she manages to slam the hood on an inspector and kill a cigar-smoking worker, whether it's from suffocation or sheer terror we'll never know. The clue might be in the choice of music though, the sound of ""Bad to the Bone"" has the same effect as ""Born to Be Wild"" in ""Easy Rider"", we get the point about Christine, she's like a 'mechanical' Jessica Rabbit who was 'assembled that way'.Then we get to 1978 where we meet Arnie, the nerdy kid bullied at school, tormented by bossy parents and best friend with school's jock Dennis (John Stockwell). And the immersion in Arnie's not-so-quiet suburban life shows how high Carpenter is aiming in spite of the critical failure of his previous movie ""The Thing"", ""Christine"" doesn't try to be the spiritual successor of ""Friday the 13th"" but ""Carrie"" as it takes time to let Arnie grow on us, as a poor bird trapped in the cage of a pampered education, whose seeming insecurity hides a good sense of humor and the repartee of a young Woody Allen, if only self-pity hadn't trapped his persona and made him the target of brutal physical bullying.Yes, there's some déjà vu with the scenes involving Buddy and his gang but it all sets up that crucial moment when Arnie meets Christine (sounds like some cute rom-com, does it?). The two wrecks are in the worst possible shape but in a sort of mutual and symbiotic back, they rebuild one another (and if that's not love, I don't know what it is). And like in real life, parents disapprove relationships but Arnie, improving already, confronts them and move his beloved new car in Darnell's garage. Darnell (Robert Prosky) doesn't get an instant liking on Arnie but appreciates his dedication to work and hires him for a few daily jobs. Interestingly, instead of showing Arnie's metamorphosis, Carpenter changes the flow of the narrative and starts focusing of his friend.We see Dennis attempting (and failing) to get a date with the new girl in school, Leigh, played by Alexandra Paul who has the homely concealed sexiness of a then-Katie Holmes. The cuteness doesn't slow down the film as it all pay-offs in the football game, when we see from Dennis' perspective, Arnie who turned out to be a real greaser engaging into a deep passionate kiss. When Dennis sees them, he freezes and get injured then the film gets makes a splendid U-turn and takes the same road of regular slasher movies with less blood but no less thrills, and another winner score from Carpenter. Sure some killings get rather predictable but they're done with a sense of evil glamour as Christine gets more and more prevalent as a character, with her headlights of doom and the way she use Rock as subliminal messages, even when she's almost defeated, her ""Rock and Roll is here to stay"" sounds like her saying ""I ain't dead yet, suckers!"".The film features many great oldies' songs that work like a second language to the iconic vehicle but for all its great special effects and suspenseful scenes, I've got to say that the performance of Gordon, turning slowly into a ghoulish loner is one of the best things about ""Christine"". He embodies the way isolation can push any weak soul to make a deal with the Devil, the film could have been called ""Christine and Arnie"" and be labeled as a romance to hell.Watching again, it plunged me back to my memories 25 years ago when I first saw I and hid my head under the blanket during some scary scenes, and from that night, whenever someone told me he hated Rock and Roll, you know which movie moment instantly popped in my head.",Christine
49,bowmanblue,Don't call the Automobile Association,7,27 March 2018,"A new book by horror writer Stephen King is normally met with 'Oohs' of anticipation. A new film based on one of his books is met with much 'eye-rolling.' For some reason the translations of his work from text to screen have been very hit and miss (and when I say 'hit and miss' I mean more 'miss' than 'hit.' However, back in 1983 when Stephen King films were a rarity and John Carpenter was still a highly-thought of director, it was a combination that couldn't fail (despite the slightly shaky premise!). 'Christine' is about a 'killer car' of the same name. How does a car kill people without a driver? Well, it's sentient for a start. How did it become sentient? Well, it just did, okay? Deal with it and enjoy the daft ride.A slightly geeky youngster acquires Christine as his pride and joy and maybe gets a little too close to it for comfort. In other words, he soon becomes besotted with it and dare I say the attraction is reciprocated, even to the point where Christine gets quite jealous of the boy's new (human!) love. What follows is a tale of...well, like I've already said - a sentient killer car. That's it in a nutshell and, if you're able to suspend your disbelief long enough to buy that, you'll have a lot of fun.It's not particularly gory for a horror film, but what it lacks in the red stuff flying everywhere, it more than makes up for in mood and ambience. I haven't read the book, so can't really comment on the source material is based on, but I'm guessing it's a lot better than the film's actual script (which is pretty clunky and generic at the best of times). The actors can hardly be judged on their performances as they probably do the best they can with what they're given, but it's fair to say that you won't be recognising many faces you see here. What truly elevates this film from being a completely forgettable and laughable attempt at horror is John Carpenter's direction. If you've seen any of his other seventies/eighties classics (i.e. 'Halloween, The Thing' and a few more) then you'll know all about the slow camera shots and droning one-note musical scores which accompany the film and build up a nice sense of dread an anticipation.I'd like to say that 'Christine' stands up today like it did when it was released and, to a certain audience that's true. Apart from those of us who saw the film at the time and watch it with a heavy dose of nostalgia, I can see those who can appreciate how horror films were made nearly forty years ago will enjoy looking back at the gem from the past. However, for those who are just craving masses of blood and decapitations this will seem like a long-drawn out and dull affair.",Christine

53,The-Sarkologist,When our possessions possess us,8,15 September 2013,"I have said a lot about my opinion of Stephen King elsewhere but I will touch upon it again now. I had a teacher in highschool that pretty much hated anything written by Stephen King and claimed that his books had no literary merit whatsoever. To be blunt, he would refer to them as airport trash, namely books that you pick up at an airport bookshop to read on the plane but not to think too deeply about. Now, ever since he has said that I make a habit of visiting airport bookshops when I am able and I must say that his statement with regards to the contents of airport bookshops, as well as Stephen King novels, is probably one of the most narrow minded statements that I have ever heard.Ignoring the comment about the contents of airport bookshops, this particular story, of which I have also read the book, is a case in point. Christine, in my opinion, is pretty close to what one would consider to be literature. First of all the story has strong characters which change as the story progresses. Further, the main character, Archie, has a fatal flaw, and that is his love of the car that he has purchased. Okay, there is a question as to whether he is possessed or not (he is) but so say that the characters in this story are shallow and one dimensional simply shows that one has not actually read the book.Christine is basically an attack against materialism and is an allegory of how our love of our possessions can dominate us and then in turn destroy us. This particular story focuses on the love of a car, and being American in nature and understanding the American love obsession with the car, it is probably a good object to use in relation to this idea. Okay, in the book itself the car is possessed by the spirit of its former owner (something that didn't stick in my head) but in the film the car itself is simply possessed right from when it rolled off of the assembly line in Detroit.As is the case when you attempt to bring a book across to a film a lot is lost in the translation. There is apparently a debate as to whether Archie was actually driving the car when it was going around killing people. In the book it is clear that he was not in the car, and because I generally always defer back to the book, I would also take the position that he was not in the car. However, one thing that wasn't brought out in the film was the work that Archie was doing for the guy that owned the wreckers. In the film it is suggested that the work was all legit, however in the book, it wasn't. Still, as I have mentioned, when you transplant a story from text to film there is going to be some loss in translation (there always is).However, I thought the film stood up to the book pretty well nonetheless and actually really enjoyed it. Maybe it is because John Carpenter is also a pretty good director when he wants to be.",Christine
54,paulclaassen,Well made cult horror film.,6,13 July 2020,"Nerd. Tick. Bullies. Tick. Hunk. Tick. Sexy girl. Tick. Hey, all the typical horror characters are here!And no, Christine is not the sexy girl. Christine literally is the car from hell. Yup, 'Christine' is about a demonic car. What next? When it comes to Stephen King, anything is possible (Oh, don't forget about killer trucks in 1986's 'Maximum Overdrive'...)Keith Gordon is excellent as the nerdish boy, Arnie, who buys a scrap car in an attempt to boost his image, and self esteem. However, being a car from hell, it seems to posses the driver. Arnie's character development is very well done. In a way I actually rooted for Arnie, even when things started going very wrong, and every time a bully got what he deserved, I actually went ""Yeah!!!"".I enjoyed the hunk and nerd being best friends, and the wonderful chemistry between them. It felt genuine, enhancing the feeling of rejection when the nerd undergoes a transformation. I felt the film disguised a number of underlying themes as a car killer movie. Okay, so one could essentially analyze this much deeper, but lets stick to the theme at hand.There's just something about the sight of a burning car in pursuit that's really awesome. The action scenes were good, the car transformation scenes awesome, the acting really good, and characters I cared about. 'Christine' might not go down as an 80's horror favorite (for me), but it certainly won't be forgotten. No wonder this became a cult classic.",Christine
55,sol-,Car Kills,7,5 March 2017,"Certain that there is something sinister and supernatural about his best friend's new car, a high school jock eventually resorts to drastic measures in this iconic horror film based on a Stephen King novel. The film is visually impressive as per director John Carpenter norm with lots of mobile camera-work, and Keith Gordon is excellent as the new car owner who gradually transforms from poorly dressed, mild- mannered and reserved to slick, cocky and arrogant. The film may have been more interesting had it been told from Gordon's perspective rather than his best friend's, but even if we never quite get inside his head, the metaphorical nature of his transformation resonates as the milestone of owning his first car makes him feel confident and assertive for the first time. There is also a lot to like in the notion of a car that seems to get energy from the passion that its owner shows towards it, perhaps even growing jealous of others who show him warmth and affection. The film disappoints when it comes to explaining the supernatural origins of the automobile, inexplicably evil right from the time it gets off the assembly line (in King's book, the car's evil nature only comes from its previous owner expressing too much affection for it) but the film makes up for it with a candid look at the ability of car ownership to completely change one's personality. King's fascination with this relationship between cars and owners would continue with his directing of 'Maximum Overdrive' a few years later, though without the pronounced human element here.",Christine
56,tomgillespie2002,Well executed horror,6,4 August 2015,"Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a dorky high-school kid with only one friend in the world, jock Dennis (John Stockwell). Arnie is the type of kid who gets pushed around by bullies and has his glasses stamped on while teachers look the other way as they think it'll probably do him some good. Things change when Arnie stumbles upon a run-down Plymouth Fury and decides to buy it, against the wishes of his parents and Dennis himself, who feels an uneasy presence within the car. The car is named Christine, and as Christine's appearances improves, so does Arnie's - he slicks his hair, wears cooler clothes, and is generally more confidant and cocky. But when Arnie starts the date the school's hot newcomer, Leigh (Alxandra Paul), the car is thrown into a bloodthirsty fit of jealousy.Made on the back of a hot streak that helped turn John Carpenter into a horror icon, Christine is a relatively minor work by his early standards, but is still infused with Carpenter's sense of style and atmosphere. Based on the novel by Stephen King, which went to lengths to explain Christine's psychopathic behaviour, the film instead establishes the red hunk of auto-porn as evil from the get- go as it kills someone before it's even off the assembly line. Perhaps trying to explain why a car was killing people in cold blood and how it possesses the ability to repair itself would somewhat remove the façade, choosing (or hoping) instead to let the audience simply enjoy the movie without the need for clunky exposition. And it works - Carpenter has it play out with a straight face and the film is very enjoyable for the majority of its 100 minute running- time.The film takes time to develop its story and a supporting cast that includes Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Roberts Blossom helps things move along nicely. When heads begin to roll, Carpenter delivers a couple of visually arresting set-pieces involving an attack on some bullies at a gas station and the chasing-down of a fat kid, both of which see Christine attack her sweetheart's aggressors with all the grace of a bull in a china shop. There's only so much you can do when your killer is a car, and it naturally takes a lot of bone-head's to let themselves be killed by it. No-one seems to move sideways, run up some stairs or enter a building (unless it's a flimsy gas station). But Christine does manage to somehow take on a personality of its own, and there's always something oddly satisfying about watching metal scrape, crash or burn on screen. It pales in comparison to the likes of Escape from New York and The Thing, which came the two years before, but Christine is a perfectly well-executed horror.",Christine
57,Dr_Coulardeau,Superbly masterful,10,13 June 2009,"This film will be effective and pungent forever. We can regret the reduced presence of old rock and roll music in the film, as compared to the novel. We can regret the absence of the pregnant theme of Arnold's being haunted by the car to the point of the car getting him away from the crime scene when necessary. Then the ending is a lot less pathetic, poignant and powerful. It is even slightly weak. But the film as a whole is a masterpiece. A masterpiece about these teenagers and their only interests in life, the car and the girl they possess, want to possess or aspire to possess, just like they drink beer, out of spite. But it is always a question of possession. King inverts the direction of this fatal element and the owner is possessed by his own piece of property. The depicting of the possessive and tyrannical parents is superb. The magic of the car is beautiful. The bullies and the way they are treated all along and the way they are reduced to trashing a car and defecating on its dashboard is absolutely pitiless and treats them just the way they should and must be treated: like trash. We find it a good positive thing that these worth-nothing individuals are crashed and crushed and exploded and burnt to death by the car they have dared insult and trash themselves. Vengeance has such a sweet taste to the virginal tongue of a teenager who still thinks his tongue is done to lick ice-cream cones. There is little more to say about it except that it is obvious adults are giving little damn about teenagers. The film only has five adults. The parents who are aggressively possessive. The workshop teacher who is absent when he should not be and then violent when he should have prevented it by being in his place at the right time: that is called duty. Then Darnell who is suspicious, hostile, greedy, rotten and corrupt, and yet impotent in front of such a miracle: a teenager kept on a leash by a magical car. Finally the inspector did not understand anything, or rather, if he understood anything, did not do what he should have done: put Arnie and his car under surveillance, and even the car in custody, not to say in prison. He let the criminal and its accessory free to go on killing. And that was a state cop, from the State of California. That's what I call a respectable body of the security forces of our modern world. Yet I do prefer the book, even if John Carpenter avoided the pink color of the bulldozer which is in the film a pink kaka-eater. Plain yellow is more visually realistic. A pink bulldozer sounds like a pink panther.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Christine
58,zkonedog,"Decent Visuals, But Nothing Else",3,8 March 2017,"Right off the bat, there are two ways of interpreting this film: If you haven't read the novel, you might find it a decent effort from filmmaker John Carpenter. If you have read the Stephen King masterpiece, you'll be left feeling more than a bit unsatisfied.For a basic plot summary, ""Christine"" tells the story of an evil car who first grips young Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) with ""her"" menace, then schemes to murder his best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) & girlfriend Leigh (Alexandra Paul).The one nice thing I have to say about this film is that, if having read the book, it provides some nice visuals. The characters are roughly what I pictured while reading, and the car scenes are very well done.Unfortunately, the pleasantries end there. The plot (so magnificent at the pen of King) is an utter mess via Carpenter's camera, while the characters are more like caricatures of the actual King lifebloods. I realize that some things need to be chopped in the name of film, but this was one of the worst jobs I've ever seen. Without the knowledge that the book gives, I can't see anyone getting into this movie on an level deeper than ""horror flick"".To top things off, director Carpenter tries to add his ""Halloween touch"" by using the same visual style and music (almost to a ""tee"") as the first two Halloween films. What a rip-off! It really doesn't add much to this middling effort, and just made me think of Carpenter as a one-track wonder.Thus, this film can easily be skipped before or after reading the novel. If the material must be covered in some format, leave the storytelling to Mr. King...in this case, where it belongs.",Christine
59,poe426,Classic...,10,10 March 2002,"As had Stanley Kubrick with THE SHINING, John Carpenter took from Stephen King what was needed to craft a good movie and discarded the rest (which is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock had espoused throughout his career). King tapped into several of the quintessential Twentieth-century archetypes, and Carpenter happens to have been on the same wave length, filtering it through his own cinematic sensibilities. (And, if you think that's easy, just ask King himself, whose Big Screen version of his short story TRUCKS is something less than tolerable.) Few people have been willing to give Carpenter credit where credit is due. (In fact, in at least one interview following the release and general dismissal of the film- by everyone, including King himself- Carpenter ventured that perhaps he had made some mistakes along the way. I beg to differ.) CHRISTINE happens to be the best cinematic treatment of a King story so far- bar none.",Christine
60,filipemanuelneto,"t's a good movie, but it has its flaws.",7,3 December 2019,"This movie is based on a horror novel by Stephen King and expertly directed by John Carpenter, a devoted master of horror cinema. It basically tells the story of Christine, a fifties car that has a spirit of its own and an instinctive will to kill. The car belonged to the same owner for decades but, after death, was sold by his brother, in very poor condition, to teenager Arnie Cunningham, a shy, withdrawn teenage geek. As he restores his new car, Arnie changes: changes the way he dresses and is, becomes brash and cocky, arrogant even, and quickly realizes the supernatural characteristics of the car. But as his enemies mysteriously die, and as the police increasingly watch them closely, Arnie's parents and friends are becoming aware that the car is a bigger problem than they thought.Well, I must say I really enjoyed this movie. It has style, charm, a good rhythm and holds us until the end. The script is good, and can turn an inanimate object into a real villain. The merit is probably from Stephen King. I really think the book is better than the movie (for example, if the movie never explains the origin of Christine's evil, the book explains it logically and might even have been taken advantage of by the movie). There are good moments of action and some notable scenes, such as the car repairing itself. The use of rock-and-roll music as a supernatural sign of the car's spirit presence was clever. We also have good action scenes but (which is curious being a Carpenter movie) there is virtually no drop of fake blood or gut strewn on the floor, which may disappoint those who love the massive gore. But I, for my part, handled it well. What really displeased me was the ending. Totally anti-climatic and warm, far from what this movie required.The cast is composed of actors who were not known at the time, not being the kind of movie we see for the quality of the cast and his work: Keith Gordon did a good job as Arnie but slowly becomes a nasty being . The problem with this is that we don't feel sorry for him in the end. John Stockwell saves the day in the end and does what we could expect of him, while Alexandra Paul is not much more than a permanent damsel in distress. The rest of the cast is deleted and appears only when it has to be. At the technical level, the movie is much more interesting. Not having brilliant cinematography, it makes up for the visual, special and sound effects, which are pretty good considering the time the film was made. The cars are beautiful and the movie's soundtrack is truly good, with high quality songs and a strong bet on rock-and-roll (although George Thorogood & The Destroyers' opening song is equally excellent and a hard-rock classic).In short, although not brilliant and flawed, it is a film that still deserves our attention. It has gained classic status and has fans, and it gives us an hour and a half of good entertainment, although there is much better out there.",Christine
61,leplatypus,An atypical but good Carpenter's movie (dvd),10,1 June 2016,"For me, Carpenter is the best horror director ever : his « Halloween », « prince of darkness » « fog » were really impressive and produced fear ! here, he adapts a novel from the King of horror paperbacks, and strangely, the movie isn't scary ! But an haunted killing car is not very suited to terror and as King devised it, it' rather about the dramatic fate of a nerd in the 80s. and for that, the movie is really good, all the more than every spot is filled with a cool face : the girlfriend will do « Baywatch », the detective is Lynch family, the garage owner will do « Mrs Doubtfire », « broadcast news », « gremlins 2 », a thug « ghost-busters » and finally, the nerd who played in « Jaws 2 » is for my eyes the look alike of young Spielberg ! In all cases, he did an amazing job going from nerd to hero to menace. Unfortunately, Carpenter follows King and if at that time, his novels were amazing, they were highly heart-wrenching as he get rid of innocents heroes ! This Arnie could be Carrie mirror and i'm totally sad to see him die as he was not bad ! It was just the car who did it ! My DVD has the commentary from Carpenter and Arnie, nearly 30 minutes of cut scenes and a full making-off ! So this movie is an excellent recommendation that the 80s were definitely the best years for cinema !",Christine

There are other horror movies I like better and other Stephen King movies I like better, but this one is pretty good.In 1957, in a town called Detroit, a red Plymouth Fury is built and causes two accidents, one of them being fatal. I wonder how it did that. Twenty-one years later, an outcast and nerd, Arnold ""Arnie"" Cunningham rides past the wrecked car in a junkyard.

It's a surprise that the car would survive two decades then suddenly it would catch the eye of nerdy Arnie(Keith Gordon). He absolutely restored ""Christine"" and would later be a part of her, one way or the other. This car was so jealous, that his single life would be complicated.

She squeezes herself through a loading dock and killed the fat one. Then she decimates a garage with flames on her, knowing that she's a messenger from beyond, burning the other punk, then take on this strange blue color if I'm wrong, to in the garage a smoking gray. I think Christine was just a engine of mass-destruction, and mayhem. Killing the guy in the garage by asphyxiation. The heroes were Arnie's friends. They didn't feel like that because the failed to save Arnie, but it was Arnie's own undoing that led to his demise. His life should have been more important than a car.

69,FiendishDramaturgy,Sub-standard King adaptation,5,20 January 2004,"While this ~is~ a good movie, it qualifies as one of the many truly bad King adaptations. Mainly, there is no mention whatsoever of Lebay, focusing rather, on Christine. While, in my opinion Carpenter did about the best he could have with that book, I guess...it is definitely worth a mini-series remake. The book was so much more in-depth, so much richer, fuller, and had so much more substance than this movie, even though this is still a very enjoyable and creepy film.But with another director's name in the title (or even in the subtitle), such as ""Kubrick's The Shining,"" and so on, it's ripe for being remade. Mr. King doesn't seem to particularly appreciate sharing the by-line, even if he has to ruin a superior film, as in the same production I just referenced, to correct that condition.The premise of this story is good: a nerdy, unlovable, moronic dweeb buys a car which is a rolling piece of junk, invests far too much time and money into it for lack of a life, and feeds so much of his energies into the car, that he causes the dark spirit of the car to become reanimated, even as the entity contained within the car, possesses him.This is a pretty good plot line which, unfortunately, was far superior on paper than this endeavor on film.However, without comparing the movie to the book, the movie is quite enjoyable. I've recently watched this one again, keeping in mind not to do the comparing thing, and the movie does stand alone quite well.My suggestion is, as always with King, watch the movie first. That way, you'll still enjoy the movie AND the book, which always seems to be better.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Christine
70,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: From the works of Stephen King. A film by John Carpenter.,4,7 August 2005,"Christine (1983) is another in a line of flawed Stephen King adaptations. This story is about a car that has a supernatural grip over a teenage boy. Since this movie was made by John Carpenter, I was over joyed and ecstatic to watch it. But I was disappointed by the flaws. I mean how hard is it to keep to the original storyline? When you try to hard at something you'll always fail no matter how good your intentions are.The movie take place in the late seventies. Two teenagers Arnold Cunningham and Dennis Guilder(John Stockwell & Keith Gordon) are driving home from school one day when they drive by a dilapidated car. For some reason Arnie is fascinated by the vehicle. His buddy Dennis knows that the car is trouble but Arnie wont listen to him and that's just the beginning of it. What has Arnie got himself into? A better question is why did John Carpenter even bother making this movie?A tepid adaption that has none of the cool stuff in it that made the book so interesting. The characters are not fleshed out enough and the actors aren't even motivated. john Stockwell doesn't even look like a football player and Arnie doesn't morph into a throwback character like he did in the book. That's just scraping a little off of the surface. I could go on forever. I love John Carpenter's work but this one is extremely flawed. Maybe they'll adapt this one into a mini-series. Until this people will still fawn over this movie for reason unknown to me.Not recommended (unless you're a die-hard Carpenter fan).",Christine
71,dee.reid,An automaniac's love story,8,15 October 2005,"She's mean, she's lean, she's a killing machine, she's Christine, a 1958 Plymouth Fury gloriously restored to assembly-line beauty by a gawky teen in John Carpenter's effectively creepy, if not entirely successful and uneven 1983 horror movie. Adapted from Stephen King's chilling novel, ""Christine"" is master of suspense Carpenter's definitive vision of teenage autocidal lust and anguish that's thankfully devoid of immature teen comedy theatrics.The film begins typically enough: set on the first day of the new school year in the picturesque suburb of Rockridge, California in 1978, we're introduced to amiable geek Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) and his one and only friend, jock Dennis (John Stockwell). Arnie is the typical geek subject of teen movies: he wears glasses (which are conveniently broken at some point during the film, requiring masking tape to hold them together), wears high-riding trousers, is ignored by the ladies, and is constantly picked on by bullies, who give him the deplorable nickname ""Cuntingham.""For the first 45 minutes or so, the film pretty much shares the qualities of most of the teen comedies of the early '80s. The characters are typical of the genre melodrama: the hero, the jock, the bully (or four in this case), and there is even a girl too  Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). Of course Dennis, acting on the compulsion of fellow jocks (or hormones?) tries to pick her up first but is shot down.After a harsh first day of their senior year, Arnie and Dennis are on their way home when Arnie spots a dilapidated Fury rusting away in the yard of an old coot. Its (or her) name is Christine; it's love at first sight for Arnie and Christine. The man is glad someone's finally taking the thing off his hands, but doesn't reveal to them the vehicle's sordid and troublesome history  like how those who come between Christine and her owner often meet with grisly fates. Arnie writes him a check and drives it home, much to the protest of his overbearing parents, who aren't the least bit happy he bought a new car without consulting them first.But he's not hearing that though; Arnie's like a kid with a new toy: he's determined to rebuild Christine, and why shouldn't his parents be proud he's not out getting into trouble and not failing any of his college-level classes at school? But because Christine is apparently an eyesore, his parents demand he keep the thing somewhere else, chiefly the garage of hard-a** mechanic Will Darnell (Robert Prosky) at his auto-wreck yard. Within weeks, Christine has been restored to her original beauty, and Arnie is suddenly a true ladies man, with cute Leigh by his side.But soon everyone, except love-struck Arnie, realizes Christine is not perfect, and that she even becomes jealous of his courtship of Leigh. Anything that comes between them is automatically against them, and nothing will tear them apart. What's more, it could be that something ghastly lies deep within Christine's chrome-laden frame and fenders, inside her monstrous V8 engine that makes nearly every other classic vehicle featured here cringe with fear.""Christine,"" released between Carpenter's ultra-gory sci-fi chiller ""The Thing"" (1982) and heartfelt and sincere mainstream sci-fi romance ""Starman"" (1984), is exemplary in that it shows admirable restraint in dealing with the bloodier components of the somewhat disjointed and uneven script. Death by auto is given new definition with ""Christine,"" as witnessed in the many nocturnal killing rampages, like when she is set ablaze and becomes literally hell on wheels. Also, the teen romance receives a daring new spin in the vein of true Carpenter fashion.Of course when things start to get interesting, some elements are not entirely explained or explored, like the truly twisted depth of Arnie's blossoming love affair with Christine or Christine's supposed psychic link to her beau. Also, I don't think Stockwell's Dennis is given enough screen time to be terrified for his friend (which is somewhat explained by his football injury and subsequent recovery in the hospital). Lastly, the ending confrontation seemed to make Carpenter's otherwise excellent film revert to formula.The performances are exceptional. Gordon is intense in a controlled yet sympathetic and tragic performance of the boy experiencing the pains of first love, albeit twisted, obsessive first love. He is quite scary, especially in later scenes with the love of his life; I'm surprised he didn't get better work as a result of his role here. Stockwell and Paul are sufficient as the concerned best friend and girlfriend, and genre regular Harry Dean Stanton even drops in as the detective assigned to stop Christine's autocidal rampage.""Christine"" is a chilling exercise in horror from a master, despite a few problems. The ride is fun if not somewhat bumpy, but ""Christine"" is definitely one ride you may want to take again and again, if you have the stomach for it, of course.8/10",Christine
72,jimbo-53-186511,Much worse than I was expecting,3,25 April 2015,"John Carpenter is a director whose films I generally like; 2 examples being The Fog and Big Trouble In Little China. This film is also based on a Stephen King novel and again I have generally liked many films that have been adapted from King's novels. Therefore I was sure when I sat down to watch Christine that it was going to be at least mildly scary and relatively suspenseful. Yet sadly it wasn't....The screenplay for this film has been adapted by Bill Phillips and I'm unsure whether that's part of the problem with this film. The start of the film is quite dull and seems to start out as some weird 'teen dramedy' - some of it is needed to explain the 'revenge' aspect that we see later in the film, but the first half of the film just seemed to be way too drawn out for my liking. As mentioned, the characters are either annoying or unlikeable and I found myself becoming more and more bored with this film as it trundled along.Things do pick up slightly in the second half of the film when 'Christine' is let loose on all those that have wronged her. The tension is cranked up slightly and it at least becomes a little more exciting and enjoyable. Sadly though you have to sit through an hour of pretentiousness, dull dialogue, and a boring romance etc before the film even begins to take a darker turn. Although the second half of the film was mildly engaging, it wasn't particularly scary and the wrap up was also formulaic and far too predictable.Ending on a positive note, I thought that Keith Gordon was superb in the lead role. He had the difficult task of taking on a very complex character and was effective as both the nerd we saw at the beginning and was also great as his much darker alter ego. Robert Prosky was also great fun as Cunningham's ruthless boss. Both of these actors were clearly much better than the film itself. I'd give this one a swerve.",Christine
73,Foreverisacastironmess123,"""You're mine, and we belong together...""",8,10 March 2019,"Arnie is a shy nerdy high school kid who is bullied and who's parents pretty much run his whole life, and then one day he comes across Christine, a rundown old wreck of a car from the 1950, and is immediately smitten with what he sees. He painstakingly fixes it up and gradually turns into an entirely different person as it becomes increasingly clear that Christine is no ordinary car, and he slowly descends into an obsessive madness... it's funny how most of John Carpenter's movies have aged so well and even gotten better with age, and this is one of his works that I didn't think much of as a kid, but it's grown on me a lot and I now appreciate its characters, special effects, and mostly its very well realised deeper themes of the dark side of teenage rebellion, the loss of friendship, and bad toxic relationships. To read it the plot does sound like it would make for a bit of a silly story, but I think it's a real testament to the younger and top of his game John Carpenter's sheer talent as a director that he was totally able to craft a horror movie about a murderous motor-vehicle that to me at least, never comes off as stupid at all but is actually quite creepy and atmospheric. The central relationship between a guy and his precious car is interestingly done, as the car becomes as obsessed over Arnie as he is over it, to the point where it's willing to kill anyone it perceives as getting in the way of of their 'love', while he becomes like its living slave. I'm very impressed watching it these days just how well they managed to make Christine scary, because although the Plymouth Fury was a very cool and commanding car and the vivid blood red was very striking, it was still just a car.. But with the score and how they lit it, and way it spookily expressed its emotions through old pop rock songs, as well as its ability to pull itself back together when he is fully ready to believe and witness it, really made it feel like something alive rather than a mere object, and despite not being able to talk or have a face, you still very much get the otherworldly menace of that car. I like the idea better that the car *is* the demon rather than it being possessed by a ghost like in the book, it opens up more broad possibilities regarding its meaning that way. I don't think it ever looks better than in the phenomenally shot sequence where it languidly chases and mows down a young punk like a fiery vision of hell on wheels, the image of the ghostly headlights has got to be the most memorable moment of the whole movie. I don't see many directors taking that source material and making it into a movie that turned out as well as this one did, Carpenter did such a good job of putting his own stamp on Christine to such an extent that in my opinion, it feels like a John Carpenter movie first and a Stephen King vehicle(!) second. And plus because he did the score as well you knew it came with some great music! I love the effect of the car regenerating, it still looks pretty awesome to me, it was like the freaking T-1000! Even the final scene with the cubed Christine still twitching, cute as it is, I find slightly eerie, as it's been subdued for now, but evil never dies forever... I was surprised by how much deleted material there was, but I'm glad that Carpenter wisely chose to get rid of the whole vague subplot of Leigh and Dennis falling for each other, because it only really served to make them less sympathetic as characters and added a note of betrayal to their relationship with Arnie, it was just better that they were two friends working together to try and save another friend from himself. Most of the performances were good but I especially enjoyed the late great Roberts Blossom, he's hilarious and brings a little pathos to the movie as he reveals some of the car's tragic past, and it really tickled me just how much he looked the part of the wily old junkyard crank who had plenty of old stories to tell! This isn't quite on the same level as The Thing, but it's a good solid John Carpenter flick as well as a good Stephen King adaptation, and I'm glad that overtime it's got the love it deserves as a terrific 80s horror watch. They don't make em like this anymore, and the car really was the star!",Christine
74,drownnnsoda,"Look out, Rockbridge—she's hell on wheels",10,28 November 2015,"Based on Stephen King's novel, ""Christine"" has a high school nerd, Arnie (Keith Gordon) buying a rundown 1958 Plymouth Fury with a morbid past. His friend, the popular Dennis (John Stockwell) begins to notice personality changes in Arnie, mainly centered around his obsession with his new car, which is called Christine. The new girl in town, Leigh (Alexandra Paul) begins dating Arnie, and also notices the changes. After some local bullies trash the refurbished Fury, it's not long before Christine takes revenge.What is an ostensibly ridiculous story (a killer car, yeah, I know how it sounds) works for two reasons here: first, the source novel by King is very well-written; and second, because we have John Carpenter at the helm of the film, steering corner after corner with remarkable finesse. What could have been utter tripe is actually one of the most timeless and well-done horror films of the eighties.I would go so far as to say that ""Christine"" may be a technically perfect film, or at least close to it. The film sets itself up as a sort of throwback to the fifties doo-wop culture of early rock'n'roll, drive-ins, and vintage cars, all in spite of the fact that the film is set in 1978. The novel and the film have an equal nostalgia for Americana, something that seems to translate more effectively on screen than it does in literature. Carpenter captures suburbia as effectively as he did in ""Halloween,"" though atmospherically, ""Christine"" has more in common with a film like ""Fright Night"" than it does with the former. The thematic center of the film lies in the car itself, which acts as not just an emblem of American culture, but also as a metaphor as well as an object for projection of Gordon's tortured protagonist.Shots of the small town streets and the ruby-red Fury are aesthetically perfect, and the action scenes are very nicely done. Another element of the film that contributes to its timelessness is the high-brow special effects which still hold up astoundingly well after nearly thirty years. Solid, likable performances from Keith Gordon and John Stockwell up the ante as well, with a young Alexandra Paul supplying the teenage high school crush/eventual comrade. Character performances from Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky, and Roberts Blossom elevate the film even further. A young Kelly Preston also appears in the film as one of the kids' cheerleader classmates. A pleasant mixture of fifties rock all the way to the Rolling Stones and George Thorogood round out the soundtrack, which acts as a nice varnish on the film.Overall, ""Christine"" is a somewhat unsung genre classic. No matter how absurd the story may sound, the execution here makes the film impossible to dismiss; it is highly entertaining, quirky, at times thrilling, and beautifully shot. Sophisticated special effects and the alternate-fifties-high-school universe in which the film takes place maintain the film's timelessness. Fans of small-town American horror and car films alike should find the film to be a real treat. 10/10.",Christine
75,hu675,Underrated John Carpenter Film.,8,15 June 2005,"The Car was born in Detroit... On an automobile assembly line. But she is no ordinary vehicle. Deep within the automobiles lies an unholy presence. The name of the Car is Christine-a red and white 1958 Plymouth. During the late 1970's, Christine seduced a young nerdish 17 year old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon), who become fascinated with his first car. She demands his complete and unquestioned devotion. Christine will do anything for Arnie, especially the outsides seeks to interfere with Arnie or the Car itself.Directed by John Carpenter (Big Trouble in Little China, Starman) made an excellent, dark thriller with an sense of humour. This is a fast paced film. Carpenter done some of his best directorial skills in this film with memorable scenes (especially when the car rebuilds itself). Keith Gordon gives an terrific performance as a nerdish teen turns into a creepy young man. Gordon is now a filmmaker, Gordon directed-The Singing Detective and Waking the Dead. Cast Member:John Stockwell as Arnie's worried friend also become a filmmaker, Stockwell directed- Blue Crush and Crazy/Beautiful.The DVD Special Edition has an great commentary track by Director:Carpenter and Actor/Director:Gordon. The DVD also features Three New Feautrettes & Deleted Scenes. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Stereo 2.0 Surround Sound. It would have been great if the sound quality was remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 but we can't have everything. This is a good Special Edition DVD.Christine is Based on a Novel by Stephen King (Carrie, Cujo). Everyone knows from a Book to Film is very different. In fact, Screen-Writer:Bill Phillips didn't use the subplot from the novel about Christine having the soul of the previous car's owner. It might have worked for the film but they didn't filmed it because John Landis' Instant Classic-An American Werewolf in London. Which Landis' film has a subplot about a rotting corpse is trying to warn his friend that he is becoming a werewolf. This is a One of a Kind film. Most believe the premise of Christine is Ridiculous but it works, thanks to Carpenter's sharp direction. This is also One of Stephen King's favorite film, from his novel to film. Do not miss this underrated sleeper. Panavision. (****/*****).",Christine

77,gcd70,Mediocre King Transmission,4,30 May 2008,"Yet another adaptation of a chilling Stephen King novel and yet another mediocre result.

When young Arnie first sees her he is completely taken and must have her. Soon his obsessive, paranoid 'love' for her begins to destroy his life, though he doesn't know it.Director Carpernter does have the skill to create some tension and uses the menacing car to good effect. However Bill Phillips plot only enables Carpenter to shock us, never really getting under our skin as King's novel did.The special effects team have a great time crushing and burning Fury after Fury, but other technicians have little to do.Keith Gordon makes the most of the lead role as the nerdy Arnie who quickly becomes the disturbed owner of ""Christine"".

78,fertilecelluloid,Brilliant cinematic reduction of King's great novel,9,15 February 2006,"I lost interest in John Carpenter many years ago because his films started looking and feeling like the work of someone who no longer cared. ""Christine"", on the other hand, is the work of a director at his peak. It is a brilliant cinematic reduction of the King novel's strongest elements. It is still a love story about a boy and his car, and it is still a study of teenage angst and high school cruelty, but it is also spare, stylish and uncluttered. Keith Gordon is totally believable as Arnie Cunningham (a name often mispronounced), a stuttering nerd who is given a supernatural injection of confidence by the mysterious Christine. His transformation into an assertive, confident teenager and then into an arrogant, foul-mouthed, narcissistic a-hole is a pure joy to behold. William Ostrander is simply amazing as Buddy Repperton, an over-sized machine shop jock who takes great delight in the torture and psychological abuse of Arnie. The final comeuppance of Repperton and his gang of mindless goons is deliciously satisfying. Also raising the performance bar is Robert Prosky as the indefatigable Will Darnell, a gruff, gross, cigar-chewing human troll whose garage (""for workin' stiffs!"") Arnie uses to rebuild his precious automobile. Prosky's numerous dialog exchanges with the nerdish schoolboy -- ""That's the last time you bring that mechanical a**hole in here,"" for example -- are hilarious. Arnie's disintegrating relationship with his parents is very well handled by Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips, as is his doomed romance with the stunning Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). Carpenter's score is brilliant and Donald Morgan's cinematography (especially the night scenes) is dazzling. A masterpiece.",Christine
79,dworldeater,Christine is an under rated classic that is bad to the bone!,10,11 October 2016,"Of the many Stephen King film adaptations, Christine is one of my favorites. This is directed by John Carpenter who made many of my favorite movies, including this one. This project was not quite as bleak as his previous film( The Thing), but is really well done and a classic as well in my book. The two lead actors in this film are now directors. Keith Gordon delivered an excellent performance here as leading man Arnie, who goes from nerd to Fonzie like coolness to evil psychopath. His friend Dennis(John Stockwell) is also good here as well and these two actors make their unlikely friendship believable and had great chemistry here. Alexandra Paul was stunning, but also gave an excellent performance here and sold her relationship with Arnie as the hottie with a heart of gold. While this is a movie about a haunted car that turns Arnie, a socially awkward nerd into a 50's greaser maniac. The storytelling, performances and dialogue are very strong and elevate the material far beyond typical slasher fare and other killer car movies. The score is a mix between 50's rock n' roll and Carpenter's signature score which provides great ambiance and helps build suspense. Character actors Robert Prosley, Robert Blossom and Harry Dean Stanton all are highly excellent and delivered memorable performances. Overall, Christine is excellent and John Carpenter did an amazing job making this. Christine is very under rated in my opinion and I can find no problem with this film whatsoever.",Christine
80,I_Ailurophile,"Two storytellers, one car",8,5 February 2021,"In every sense, I feel like 'Christine' often gets overlooked. As a John Carpenter film, as a Stephen King adaptation, and as a horror feature generally, it just doesn't seem to get mentioned as much. That's unfortunate, because it's actually a really good movie.The first thing to note is that 'Christine' very much feels like the meeting of minds that it is. This is unquestionably Stephen King's narrative - his plot, his characters, his dialogue - and that's made clear in the very first scene with Christine's introduction. ""Bad to the bone"" indeed, George. But there's also no mistaking that this is a John Carpenter film. Carpenter's signature style of building atmosphere washes over King's often blunt storytelling with a more nuanced stroke, and even the creeping unease and tension we expect from Carpenter is more subtle here. It's almost a perfect blend of their two styles.Carpenter's own original score greatly bolsters his keen eye as a director. The gradual transformation of nerdy Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) in Christine's entrancing grasp turns from surprising, to troubling, to terrifying, and Carpenter traces it with aplomb. A late scene in which a very different Arnie gives best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) a ride in Christine is soaked in dread and fright, with clever lighting emphasizing that alarming change from earlier scenes where a much more innocent Arnie rode as a passenger in his friend's car.There are instances where 'Christine' is a bit uneven. Some of the evil she weaves is very hocus pocus, with characters magically coming to harm by mere proximity, and for all the stories he's given us, Stephen King's style sometimes emphasizes story beats, flavor, or lines of dialogue that are a bit dubious. Yet these are counterbalanced by scenes of Christine's malice with stunts that become still more impressive when you watch behind-the-scenes featurettes. And the practical effects on display, chiefly in Christine's regeneration, add further to the atmosphere in the narrative.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention casting that also includes the capable Alexandra Paul as Arnie's girlfriend Leigh. And the inimitable late great Harry Dean Stanton doesn't get nearly enough screen time as Detective Junkins.It's been a very long time since I've read the book, or any of King's works, so I can't say I remember every little detail (let alone note differences in adaptation). But I can say with fair certainty that in less capable hands, a film about a haunted/possessed car could easily be a hackjob. In my opinion Carpenter did a fine job, and moreover - like many of his features - 'Christine' feels like a movie that only he could have made.It's more thrilling fun than genuinely scary, even with Carpenter's sense of suspense dominating the flow of the plot. 'Christine' may not be for everyone, but it's a worthy view for fans of either Carpenter or King, or fans of horror generally.",Christine
81,Jonny_Numb,Hell hath no fury like a Fury scorned...,7,14 April 2006,"For my Smart Money, ""Christine"" is one of John Carpenter's most underrated efforts (up there with ""Assault on Precinct 13""), and also one of his most effective. Even though its modest look and relative restraint in gore came as a result of ""The Thing""'s box-office failure the previous year, and Carpenter has all but admitted his heart wasn't in the project, it ultimately turned out VERY well (if this is an effort from a sleepwalking Carpenter, he's better than most directors when they're awake). As someone who was knocked out by Rob Bottin's intricately gruesome FX work in ""The Thing,"" but left cold by the shallow characters, ""Christine"" fills in the gaps of suspense and human story with ease. In retrospect, some of the absurd plot elements (""a haunted car,"" as Carpenter constantly reiterates) lends the film an odd humor that doesn't detract from things (and indeed, it was Stephen King's own infatuation with cars and rock music that inspired this story of obsession). Scenes are composed with great skill by Carpenter (making wonderful use of the widescreen image), and there are many striking images sprinkled throughout (the most incredible being the flaming Christine speeding after a villain). The excellent cast gives their all in making a potential B-movie premise glow with A-list polish: Keith Gordon's Arnie (the painfully square high-school senior who buys the titular vehicle), John Stockwell's Dennis (the resourceful jock and best friend), Alexandra Paul's Leigh (the earthy girlfriend who sparks Christine's jealousy), and Harry Dean Stanton's Junkins (the snooping P.I.) provide this tale with a lot of propulsive force. In a sense, ""Christine"" is a nice even ground between the zaniness of ""Escape from New York"" and the FX extremes of ""The Thing,"" and exemplifies Carpenter's range as a director. A very underrated effort that is very much worth your time.",Christine
82,TheFearmakers,Very 1980's set in the 1970's with a 1950's Vibe,9,19 October 2019,"John Carpenter's most sparse and subtle horror film, and based on Stephen King's multi-perspective novel, CHRISTINE is to high school what THE SHINING is to hotel management courses as Keith Gordon plays an initially geeky character suitably named Arnie, who, best friends since childhood with popular yet earthy jock John Stockwell as Dennis, the tables turn when the dork lands the prettiest girl on campus, new student Leigh played by meek ingenue Alexandria Paul..Well Kelly Preston's actually the hottest but that's an opinion, and as head cheerleader, football hero Stockwell has her in the bag yet still tries for/strikes out with Leigh before a cool Carpenter glide-cam sports scene where Dennis, running for a long bomb catch, sees Arnie kissing the tall beauty, leaning on an old, recently purchased Chevy he seemed possessed by from the moment he laid eyes on a the titular 1950's vehicle - and all to Dennis's distrust and chagrin.With only a few body count sequences against Arnie's former bullies (ignited in a shop class fight deliberately consisting of mostly closeups), each death means more than the bloody teen slasher flicks saturating the early/mid eighties' horror market...That Carpenter was obviously going against despite having started it all with HALLOWEEN, which was also surprisingly old school and subtle, and the setting and time's exactly the same (CHRISTINE exists when HALLOWEEN both takes place and was filmed), the late 1970's suburbs shaded by tall, leafy trees. And yet the aura, style and pace... including Harry Dean Stanton as a questioning, Noir-like cop... is, like the car itself, reminiscent of the 1950's, taking time in a meticulous and timeless fashion...The only problem involves Gordon's acting as he gets more and more crazy after transitioning too quickly from zero to hero; one scene in particular on a night drive with Dennis's teary-eyed reaction to his friend's dark diatribe is awkwardly melodramatic...But no matter, CHRISTINE is a nearly perfect very-good-movie that doesn't try for epic greatness and in that, succeeds in having just enough horror to sharpen the action thriller vibe where the ""possession"" is secondary to what's really, truly a first-love love-story between a boy and his car. They really do have chemistry....And what Carpenter provides is a dangerous, suspenseful setting for anyone who tries getting in their way, also including Robert Prosky as a scene-stealing, cigar-chomping mechanic, who, despite his cursing lectures, becomes more of a dad to Arnie than his uptight, condescending yet eventually, horrified parents.",Christine

84,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Imaging of a King Classic,8,21 January 2019,"This was a film that I had sought out in college when I was determined to watch all the films based off of works by Stephen King. He is my favorite writer and that was really something I was doing to get more acclimated with horror films I hadn't seen. It was an added bonus when I learned that John Carpenter was the director of this film. The official synopsis is a nerdish boy buys a strange car with an evil mind of its own and his nature starts to change to reflect it.We kick off back when the car was first built in Detroit, Michigan. It is 1957 I believe and the car is a 1957 Plymouth Fury. The day it is coming off the assembly line, one man is maimed by the car and another is killed inside of it. This isn't in the original novel, but was added that this car was evil from the beginning.It then shifts to the present. We get introduced to our main characters. We have Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who is a nerdy guy. He has overbearing parents who don't really let him live his life. His best friend is a jock, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell). He does what he can to protect his friend, even though they are seemingly from different worlds. I actually really like this aspect of the film. We normally see that when two friends hit high school, they go their separate ways as they explore different things. These two stick together and I thought it adds an interesting element.Two major things happen on their first day. Arnie is severely bullied by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) and his two friends. He actually pulls a knife on him. Dennis and Arnie point this out to a teacher and Buddy is kicked out of school. This will come back into play later. The other is that a beautiful new student starts there, Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul).On their way home, Arnie sees a car in a yard that is for sale. It is the Plymouth Fury we saw in the beginning of the film, but it has fallen into disrepair. Arnie ends up buying it off the old man who tells him that the name of the car is Christine. Arnie's parents won't let him keep it there so he has to go to the local junkyard. A man named Will Darnell (Robert Prosky) allows him to keep it there, but for a price.Arnie starts to fix the car up and getting it to look almost brand new. He also arrives at a football game with Leigh. It is at this game that Dennis gets hurt. Arnie is acting different too. That night Buddy and his friends destroy the car. It doesn't stay like that and it is out for revenge.This film really has a solid deeper meaning to it that I didn't pick up on until this time watching it. The interaction of Arnie with his parents we see that they are quite controlling of him. He actually says to Dennis that he thinks part of it is if he starts to do more adult things, they lose him as their son. I do have friends with overbearing parents so that is an interesting way to look at it. Christine is giving Arnie the energy and even making it to where he doesn't need his glasses. The novel is interesting in that Arnie I know is covered in zits and might be overweight. The car helps to clear all of that up. It becomes a symbiotic relationship where both of them need each other. It doesn't go as deep as that in the film, but we get enough of it.I do have an issue with the relationship with Leigh and Arnie. It really happens rapidly and ends much in the same way. I just think that could have been fleshed out a little bit, as she really doesn't seem to be all that needed for the film. Most of it is just to show that he has become confident thanks to Christine, but seeing how they came together and when things were going good would have helped.This brings me to the pacing of the film. I do think that the film is a little bit slow. The longer running time might contribute to that. It takes almost to the forty minute mark where something happens. I get that the car needs to be fixed before it can do anything, but it took a bit for me to get into it. Once it has though, the film really picks up and builds tension. I do like how it ends and making you wonder if it is all over or not.The acting is something that I thought was solid. Gordon really does embody the role for the film. I do think they should have done a little bit more before he gets Christine to really play up its effects on him. He has low self-esteem and glasses, but maybe the acne could have helped as well. Stockwell is good as the jock friend. I have touched on that I like he isn't your normal jock though. I like the dynamic between him and Arnie. Paul is gorgeous in the film, but I think she is really underutilized. Prosky is good as the jerk who is allowing Arnie to use his garage. I also want to shout-out to Harry Dean Stanton, who is the detective when the murders start. Same goes to Ostrander, Steven Tash, Stuart Charno and a young Kelly Preston as well for rounding out the film with their acting.Something that really blew me away for this film was the effects. It is amazing how they could destroy the car and make it look like it was fixing itself. I have read up a little bit at what they did, using hydraulics and I'm assuming shooting it one way and then playing it in reverse. Whatever they did, it was great. Seeing this car do things that it probably shouldn't be able to was good as well. This film was also shot very well and it looks great.I did notice that Carpenter did the music along with Alan Howarth. For the most part we get old Rock 'n Roll songs, but I like how they incorporate the lyrics to how the car seems to be talking to the characters. We also get some great musical cues that this duo is really good at. This isn't the best score that they have done, but I thought it was still solid. It fit for what the film needed and helped to build the tension of the scenes.Now with that said, this is a solid adaptation of a King novel. I like the idea of a car being something of evil from the beginning. The film really has a deeper concept though of growing up and how it can change us. I like that the car is able to fix itself, but also make Arnie into a better looking and more confident human. The problem does become though him becoming worse because of it. I do think there was a bit of a pacing issue for the film. The effects were great while the score of the film was really good. Acting for the film was solid as well. This isn't my favorite from Carpenter, but this is a definitely a good film. I would recommend giving it a viewing.",Christine
85,davidmvining,Corruption,6,14 September 2021,"The Thing bombed horribly both financially and with the critics, and John Carpenter retreated to safety. Some of the harder edges of his voice got sanded off, and he made a mostly routine monster movie based on an unpublished Stephen King novel. His voice seems muffled, in favor of the kind of weird story about a man falling in love with his possessed car.I've read that the opening of the film set on the assembly line that created the titular car, Christine, was a reshoot to better establish her villainy and history, and I think the movie would have played better without it. She attacks a couple of inspectors, and the movie skips forward twenty years to 1978. We meet two high school friends, Arnie (Keith Gordon) and Dennis (John Stockwell). Dennis is a football player and Arnie is a bit of a nerd with huge glasses and a propensity for being the target of Buddy (William Ostrander) and his gang. Both are also enamored with the new girl in school, Leigh (Alexandra Paul), but neither are quite brave enough to simply walk up to her.One day driving home from school, Arnie forces Dennis to stop the car when he notices an old red car marked for sale in a lot. The old man sells it to him for $250, but not without ominous portents of the car's history with his brother, the former owner. Both his brother and sister-in-law died in that car, but Arnie buys it anyway with a gleam in his eye. So begins the central relationship in the film, that between Arnie and Christine, the car.Arnie takes Christine to a garage and dump where he's allowed to use whatever he finds to fix her up in exchange for some small chores around the place. He takes her from rust bucket to a shiny dream, and along with Christine's physical transformation comes Arnie's own. He goes from nerd to suave greaser, winning dates with Leigh and just looking confident and cool in a throwback sort of way, similar to Christine herself. The central success of the film is this symbiotic relationship where they need each other.Where I find the movie much more typical and rote is almost everything else. Christine ends up being a pretty generic monster. She chases down Buddy and his gang one by one after they take sledgehammers to her (which she fixes herself of in a rather cool special effects moment), and the sequences are perfectly competently made. Most of the thrills come from the pure destruction Christine wrecks on her victims as well as herself as she goes, turning her into this unstoppable force. I suppose that this unstoppable force of a 1958 Plymouth Fury just doesn't interest as much as the unstoppable force of Michael Meyers or the Thing from another world. I suppose the jealousy and vengeance parts of her acts makes her less threatening and unknowable to me. She ends up feeling like a jealous lover, which is the point, of course.So the central point of the film is a relationship where one side is a murderous car, and the other side is an increasingly abrasive and unlikeable guy. Along for the ride is Dennis and his increasing concern for his friend. Everything goes wrong for him when he sees Arnie and Leigh making out on the sidelines of a football game, distracting him so that he gets horribly injured to the point where he will never play again. Spending most of the rest of the film in the hospital, allowing Arnie to descend further alone without his friend to help him, Dennis can't do anything to help his friend.Arnie and Leigh's relationship frays because Arnie is really in a relationship with Christine and nothing can get in between them. Everything ends up crescendoing in a monster movie climax that involves a bulldozer, and it's quality genre thrill stuff. I have nothing against the execution of this, I just never really got invested too terribly into it. I wonder if it's because of the core relationship, the focus on Christine herself despite her being just an emotionless vehicle. There's thrill to be had with how she chases down those who wronged her and Arnie, but I feel like the real focus really should have been Arnie. As it stands, the relationship feels like an excuse for monster mayhem rather than trying to do something more interesting with the idea. The thrills never become extraordinary, and it feels like a near miss.It's still a safe genre movie for Carpenter to sink his teeth into after the critical and commercial failure of The Thing, but that safety ends up numbing its effect for me a bit.",Christine
86,burlesonjesse5,"OK, show me!",7,9 May 2014,"After churning out classics like Halloween, Escape From New York, and The Thing, director John Carpenter scored again with the effectively, unsettling Christine. Based on a Stephen King novel of the same name, this is a flick about a car (1957 red Plymouth Fury) possessed by evil spirits and the dorky teenager who's life steadily changes after he purchases it. Keith Gordan (no longer an actor, now a director) plays said character (Arnold Cunningham) extremely well. He does a 180 going from shy, self loathing high school geek to remorseless bad boy (basically he changes his persona as the car becomes more and more evil).Despite plot holes that come in small doses, an underutilized Harry Dean Stanton (he does great supporting work as detective Rudy Junkins) and a final 15 minutes that drag a bit, this is still incredibly solid direction from Carpenter. The soundtrack (which he also wrote) is eerie synthesizer magic and most of the players in the main cast, have a hard, cynical edge to them. Based on the aforementioned attributes, this film for me, is quintessential 80's horror fare. Look for the scene in which Christine repairs herself after being vandalized by nasty high school bullies. It gives new meaning to the term ""show me.""",Christine
87,raulfaust,Vroom Vroom,6,4 December 2012,"I remember this movie used to be a success on a Brazilian TV channel many years ago, and considering I was just a kid, I used to afraid of this ""scary"" story. I surely could remember how the story works, since it's pretty simple-- yet original. John Carpente's movies are usually lame, but ""Christine"" (fortunately) is not. Of course a killer car story doesn't seem to be much real, but it is an interesting and innovation story to see. All the cast is professional, and so is directing-- it's the first time I say that to Carpenter. However, it doesn't have THAT good element in horror movies to make this a great picture, ending up being just another regular~good one. Watch for pure entertainment and you won't regret!",Christine
88,justin-fencsak,"Never read the book, but watching this movie is making me want to read it...",7,1 November 2018,"I never read most of stephen king's horror novels except the one about the Boston Red Sox and their broken curse called Unfaithful which i found at a dollar store, and it was a great book. Most of his horror stories have been turned into classic movies, both good and bad. One of them is Christine, filmed after the book came out in 1983 and released during the Christmas holiday season only to be a cult classic when it was released on home video. This movie is pure car-nage, as Christine is a 1958 plymouth fury that is possessed by the devil. This movie is not for kids as it is a typical Carpenter movie with sex, gore, and car violence not to mention bad language. Oh, and the soundtrack is great!!! Worth buying if you're a fan of John Carpenter and Stephen King. This was the first movie to use Bad to the Bone for its soundtrack, and the bluray is amazing!!! 35 years later, Christine still shines.",Christine
89,slayrrr666,One of Steven King's better movies,9,2 December 2005,"""Christine"" is one of the better imaginings of Stephen King's works.**SPOILERS**In 1957, one of the cars on the assembly line in Detroit seems cursed from the beginning. Strange events plague its creation for over twenty years, where geeky Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) needs to break away from his domineering mother (Christine Belford). His friend Dennis (John Stockwell) agrees, since he's tired of protecting him from the goons at school. While driving home, he and Dennis spot the fabled car collecting rust on a farm and buys it against Dennis' and his parents wishes. Fixing it up causes Arnie to start acting differently around Dennis and his mother, which causes everyone around him to become concerned for him. Suddenly, people around Arnie begin dying in mysterious ways, and a police inspector (Harry Dean Stanton) comes in to investigate the case, and discovers something that defies explanation. Soon, Dennis and Arnie's girlfriend Leigh (Alexandra Paul) have to try to help Arnie from being in Christine's deadly grasp.The Good News: This is probably as action-packed a film as Stephen King will ever do, and Carpenter was the perfect choice to do so. He uses such a great style with his trademark of not showing too much and only what is needed is a style that suits this movie perfectly. We get so many scenes that could've been ruined which weren't because of the way Carpenter shoots the movie. His way of filming is the only kind that would've worked for the film. Once we get going, the film is non-stop until the end. Seeing the car hunt down the people who have deserved it are some of the greatest action/suspense scenes ever filmed. Special mention goes to the one scene where it mowed down the lead bully. After killing his two friends earlier, the bully takes off into the night, running down the street. Christine takes off after him, flaming from being in the middle of a fire, and the flaming car is chasing after him down the street. It is a wonder site to behold, seeing the flaming car in action. A lot more action than what was expected, and even some great suspense as well. The radio constantly turning on, the car's ability to simply appear out of nowhere, and the creepiness that follows when you know you are being followed are some great examples. Seeing the car is like a warning that something will happen, and the uselessness of running is seen in the few lives taken in the film. All this aside, the one thing that really got me was the theme. This has to be one of Carpenters most underrated themes ever, and I think it is just as creepy and fear inducing as ""Halloween's"" theme was. This is the perfect theme for the movie, as it gets under your skin and keeps you on the edge of your seat at the same time. This has great theme music for the film that helps out to keep the viewer interested in the action and the scene.The Bad News: The movie could've had a faster opening, but this is it. The beginning was slow to start, but after that, it was great.The Final Verdict: Christine is a major classic that many horror fans need to see. It is a master example of setting up a scene and getting to a level of suspense through characters and action. Required viewing for Carpenter fans and all supernatural fans.Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and mild drug use",Christine
90,MartianOctocretr5,"Some good old fashioned scary monster stuff, but has a dumb premise",5,18 October 2009,"Entertaining, but silly. It's not that possessed automobiles haven't been done both before and after this film, but those others at least made the possessive spirit something to be feared.Others were possessed by psychos or demons. This one (ready?) falls in love with its owner and gets jealous of him. Christine's a girl car, you see. With a female name. She's an oldy but goody 50's vintage car, and lives in the past apparently. Her old AM radio plays only old songs. Oh, and she's red. What a poetic reference that is. Bullies who bug her owner? One guess what happens to them. People other than her owner who get in the car? Guess. The local dumb cop? Of course. Another girl getting close to her owner? You guessed it. Anybody else that rubs Christine the wrong way? The same.If the car gets mangled, some of the phoniest looking special effects ever put on film repair it. It likes to turn its lights on when it wants to scare somebody. The owner guy changes from a nerd to a 50's greaser. All clichés. All pretty mainstream.

91,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A thrilling film from Stephen King and John Carpenter,8,8 October 2014,"I'm not really a big fan of Stephen King films (except for Dolores Claiborne, Pet Sematary and IT), but I love his novels. I also loved John Carpenter's Village of the Damned and The Thing. With Christine, not only does it share a haunting soundtrack similar to Village of the Damned (1995) but it takes a simple thing we use in life and turns it into terror...Cars.Arnie is a pretty big nerd, but a nice-enough guy, best friends with a jock named Dennis. When Arnie gets the bright idea to buy a beat-up red Plymouth from some crusty old man, everything falls apart as Christine does everything to keep Arnie her's, and her's alone... and Christine is a car, so no one suspects the truth until things are too late.The acting was pretty good, I loved the soundtrack, and I loved the characters. My only statement after watching this: thank god I'm not allowed to drive a car for my entire life. (I like counting cars though in parking lots if I get bored, and the headlights always look like eyes).",Christine
92,Analog_Devotee,"7/10 -- GOOD, NOT GREAT.",7,4 June 2021,"Definitely a good time, but not quite as great as I was hoping. I saw this one with my grandma when I was about six years old, but of course barely remember given that was about a century ago. It's probably the first horror flick I ever watched.I avoided revisiting this one for a long time because I wanted to get around to the novel first. However, over the past several years my voyage into Stephen King's literary works has stalled countless times due to a growing infatuation with other horror writers whose work I find more consistently enjoyable (sacrilege, I know). And though the beautiful hardcover is on my shelf, I simply didn't feel like waiting any longer. So I popped the tape in. Hey, it's not like the novel's gonna disappear after I watch the flick, right?Anyway, I wish this one'd had more Carpenterisms. Aside from the music and a couple scenes (particularly the chase scenes), there's not much here pointing to Carpenter's presence. It appears he didn't write the screenplay adaption, so maybe that had something to do with it. In fact, I'm quite sure of it.Still a good time, but I can't imagine I'll be revisiting this one very often.",Christine
93,ODDBear,As good as it could be,7,1 July 2005,"John Carpenter's take on the Stephen King story is in my opinion a pretty remarkable film. I think Carpenter generated as much suspense as possible considering the fact that the evil doer is a car. Christine really becomes a feisty personality, better realised than many actual characters in many films. Through terrific cinematography, music and fantastic (even to this day) special effects; Christine is truly a scary villain.Also well captured by Carpenter is the take on teenage life. Although not all characters are well defined, the main character is both well played and written. Towards the end, he's really a character you feel sorry for, rather than despise, due to the way Christine has treated him.Many classic Carpenter elements are present, his unique way of creating and sustaining a moody atmosphere is well done here but there's simply no escaping the fact that the film is pretty much suspenseless. There is just no way in making a car all that scary. Carpenter does his best and in my opinion, the film couldn't have been made any better. Carpenter makes the car the real star here, and makes the movie just fun to watch. Not scary but fun.",Christine
94,MrGKB,One of the better King screen adaptations...,6,1 April 2009,"...John ""Halloween"" Carpenter's ""Christine"" has aged reasonably well despite its flaws, and remains worth a watch or two, depending on how much of a King or Carpenter fan you may be. It pales compared to the Carpenter projects it was sandwiched between (""The Thing"" and ""Starman""), but still stands head and shoulders above contemporary King features like ""Children of the Corn"" and the lamentable ""Firestarter."" Basically, it's the ol' evil machines gag, this time a bright red '58 Plymouth Fury. Keith ""Dressed to Kill"" Gordon plays Arnie, the auto-fixated nerd who rescues Christine from rusting away, John ""Top Gun"" Stockwell is the good buddy who eventually saves the day along with Arnie's amazingly faithful girlfriend, Alexandra ""Baywatch"" Paul, and reliable character actors like Robert ""Hill Street Blues"" Prosky and Harry Dean ""Repo Man"" Stanton help keep things moving along. Even Kelly ""I'm best known as John Travolta's wife"" Preston shows up in a bit role. All acquit themselves fairly well, although these aging eyes now find Gordon's appearance a bit too stereotypical to believe (his geeky glasses are just waaay too much) and his transformation equally hard to accept (his Cool Guy still registers as little more than uber-nerd). Regardless, the film is more about Christine than any of the humans who grow to love or hate her, and in this respect, it shines. Carpenter elaborates on Christine's genesis with a prequel that establishes the car's bitchiness from the get-go, showcasing George Thorogood's classic ""Born to be Bad"" long before James Cameron forever linked the tune to Arnold Schwarzenegger's iconic cyborg in ""Terminator: Judgment Day."" The sequence in which Christine restores herself after being trashed by the bad guys is classic Carpenter dramatic ingenuity and presentation, as are several other metal-crushing set pieces. With a radio that plays only 50s hits that express her ""inner feelings,"" Christine is a demon on wheels that you'll not soon forget.The recent DVD reissue comes with three nice production features, a slew of deleted scenes, and an entertaining commentary from Carpenter and Gordon (who has become a noteworthy director in his own right; check out ""Waking the Dead,""""The Singing Detective,"" or the remarkable ""A Midnight Clear"" to see what I mean).Solid B-movie entertainment that, beyond its typical Hollywood casting of 20-somethings to play teenagers, plays things seriously and refuses to dumb itself down for the brain-dead. I can't rate it higher than a ""6"", mostly due to limited replayability, but still give it an enthusiastic recommendation. If it ever gets (choke! gasp!) remade, I'm sure it will suffer accordingly.",Christine
95,one9eighty,A killer car is on the loose,5,4 February 2019,"In the 80's a lot of Stephen King novels were turned into films, some good, but most of them pretty weak and paled in comparison to the written form of the story. Christine is somewhere between those markers in my opinion.Mega-nerd Arnie Cunningham doesn't enjoy life much. One day on the way back from school he sees a car that, although it could be sent to the scrap yard, he instantly falls in love with. He buys the car, a 1958 Plymouth Fury called Christine, on the spot and spends hours of his life fixing it up. Despite alienating himself from family and friends more he eventually transforms the car into a stunning version of its former glory. Little does he know that the car has a consciousness, and has a chequered past to go with it too. The car starts taking a hold of him, and starts killing people. Can Arnie be saved before it's too late, or will the car's evil influence consume him totally!Directing, John Carpenter mixes tension and imagination to bring to life the vision dreamt up by Stephen King. The soundtrack is crafted to deliver an additional depth to the film, and helps to bring Christine to life despite being a metal machine. And the cast is decent and believable too. As a film without the book, this isn't all too bad at all - as an example, my girlfriend watched it the other night and enjoyed it. On the flip side, I have read the book, and I remember being slightly upset when I first watched the film because it wasn't as good as the vision I had read. Things were missed out or completely re-written.As far as a rating goes, I have to go right down the middle and give this 5 out of 10. If you've read the book you may be disappointed, if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy the film as a stand-alone horror story about a killer car.",Christine

What I got was nothing short of brilliant.I'm not easy to please with this kind of movie, but usually you can count on John Carpenter to give you at least one scene in each of his movies that will make you leap right out of your seat.  There was one in this.  I won't tell you where, just be ready.Plenty of shocks, surprises and a beautiful chrome dream machine straight from Hell's showroom.  Eight stars.  After this one, you may hate rock and roll, too.",Christine
97,RforFilm,Under the hood of this evil Christine is a good character study that delivers on good car violence,7,6 December 2017,"One common trait in horror stories is the ones about inanimate objects come to life. This definitely influences the terror of not being able to understand the existence on consciousness coming from something that shouldn't be there. This is why a lot of writers and directors have tackled various objects and elements come to life. We've seen killer dolls from Child's Play, killer tomatoes from Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, and even killer tires from Rubber (perhaps the weirdest of the bunch). Now the bigger and more complex the object is in question, the harder it's likely to destroy. So what about killer cars?The idea for such is actually a good one as this is one of the few objects come to life that could hide in plain sight. There's just as many cars on Earth as there are people, and it's always possible that there's a driver that we never see. Cars are built like human bodies, with layers of metal and machine hiding it's thin skeleton. We've seen them come to life in those Herbie movies like The Love Bug, and more recently in Cars, but not so much in horror format. It seems that John Carpenter decided to do so by adapting Stephen King's novel, Christine. In 1978, awkward teen Arnie Cunningham (played by Keith Gordon) is jealous that his only friend Dennis (played by John Stockwell) is the high schooler that everyone wants to be; popular, a ladies man and a football player. Arnie has to be constantly saved by Dennis from bullies, which only adds to the boy's own cowardliness. It also doesn't help that both of Arnie's parents treat him like a little boy with strict rules. Everything changes when Arnie suddenly spots an old 1985 Plymouth Fury. Sensing that this car cold be the answer to his problems, he quickly buys it from it's older owner George (played by Roberts Blossom)He restores the car at a garage run by the gruff, but encouraging Darnell (played by Robert Proskey). In the process, Arnie starts to take on the persona of a 1950's greaser with the jacket, slicked hair, and rougher attitude. This gives him the confidence to ask out the new girl Cabot. As time goes on, Arnie becomes rougher and the car manages to repair itself after damage from some bullies. This leads to the car itself going after the bullies (along with anyone whose wronged Arnie) in revenge.Christine is certainly an interesting movie. When compared to his other works, this doesn't seem like a John Carpenter-style movie. It's still shot well and manages to tell the film's story well, but a lot of the trademark attributes of his are not present (his synth score doesn't even come in until halfway). Christine is definitely a Stephen King story firstwhich is not a bad thing. I'm guessing Carpenter took on this project as his previous movie The Thing didn't do that well. The good news is that Christine works well enough that I recommend it.A lot of it has to do with the plot's focus on Arnie. You get a sense that this poor kid is in a place where he's constantly in the shadows of his friend and only wants one thing to be his. This car just happens to be that. The story cleverly lays a lot of the sympathy on him for a whileat least until the car starts acting out. From thereI really don't want to give away what happens, but that's part of the movie falls flat. The final climax with the car feels rushed and Arnie's arc seems to have been sidelined in order to deliver a crowd pleaser-style ending.Compared with what John Carpenter had to work with, he picked a good monster to use. What makes the car scary is that almost no information is given away to just how this car is doing so. It's a lot like a force that was present in Halloween or The Fog; something evil that's simply dark magic. And you think it would only be a car that runs over people, but there are some impressive effects that show the car fixing itself and squeezing in tight spaces. It's good character build and delivers on promised car action.I'll give this seven 1958 Plymouth Furys out of ten. Christine may feel like a typical studio horror thriller, but it's good at being that. There's even a bit of that B-movie style that John Carpenter fans would like to see. Check it out to see what's really under the hood that makes it good.",Christine
98,Ruskington,"Not the best King novel, but one of the better adaptations",7,25 April 2020,"Despite being an avid Stephen King fan, I never had much love for Christine and wasn't particularly excited about seeing this adaptation. I have to say though, I was pretty impressed. John Carpenter is a great fit for this story and creates just the right atmosphere with clever use of light and, of course, great music. However, it is the performances of Keith Gordon and John Stockwell that really stand out in this movie with both men arguably giving career-best performances. While I still don't care too much for the story, this is a captivating production that maybe deserves more respect.",Christine
99,ajs-10,A pretty good adaptation...,7,27 February 2011,"This is one of those movies that I've seen bits and pieces of over the years, but never all the way through, until now. You see, it's always on late at night when I get home from the pub and I either see the start, or a bit in the middle, or the start and the end (having fallen asleep in between). And so, for the first time I've seen it all the way through. It's actually pretty good, not great, but certainly worth watching sober sometime. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please help Arnie fix that beat up old Plymouth Fury while I write the next paragraph).It is 1978 where Arnie Cunningham is a bit of a dork, he wears glasses and can't get a girl to save his life. His best friend, Dennis Guilder, tries to help him out, but he's just not cut out for that kind of thing yet. After a run-in with some bullies at school one day, Dennis is giving Arnie a lift home when Arnie spots a car for sale. It's a beaten up red 1958 Plymouth Fury nicknamed 'Christine' by the owner whose brother, the former owner, had recently died. Arnie is instantly in love with the car and pays the asking price there and then. His parents don't want the car at home and so he keeps it at Darnell's 'Do It Yourself Garage' nearby. There is something strange about the car that Arnie can't quite put his finger on, but he works hard to bring her back to her former glory. As time goes by he begins to become more and more confident in himself as his obsession with the car grows. By now he has a girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, but woe betide anyone that gets between Arnie and Christine. Now, you remember those bullies I mentioned earlier, well Looks like that's all you're gonna get from me, you didn't expect the entire thing did you? Sorry to disappoint.Based on a novel by Stephen King I found this to be a pretty good adaptation of the story. The characters are well rounded and, of course, it's a damn good tale. John Carpenter did an excellent job with the special effects, no CGI back then, but you wouldn't know. Pretty good performances all round, particularly from Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, he really had to ring the changes in this one. John Stockwell did a pretty good job as Dennis Guilder, as did Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot. I also have to mention Robert Prosky whose almost comic-book performance as Will Darnell was excellent and it was nice to see a younger Harry Dean Stanton as Detective Rudolph Junkins.At the end of the day the star of the show is definitely the car, Christine. It has its own personality and a big role to play in the film. This is brought across very well by some excellent direction, some brilliant special effects and the performances of the human cast. It's far from perfect I know, maybe a little long, but at the end of the day it's still worth a watch (or two preferably sober, but not essential) Recommended.My score: 6.5/10",Christine
100,Atreyu_II,Whoever messes with Christine is done,7,14 June 2008,"Although I hate horror films, 'Christine' is good for a terror film and possibly the best of its kind. It isn't a great or extraordinary film, but the story impresses despite its simplicity. Besides, this is probably the only terror film you'll ever see me rating as a 7, which is significant.'Christine' isn't just terror, however. It has also strong elements of drama, thriller, suspense, darkness and action. Does the combination work out? Let's say that is turns to be okay, although impressive in many ways. The movie has also some nasty language, which is excessive sometimes.The story is original in its own way. Yes, the idea of a car with a mind of its own that even drives by itself is not something that hasn't been done before: see KITT, Giselle and Herbie, for example. Like these, Christine is not an ordinary car and is baptized with a name but, while the 3 cars I mentioned are good and lovable, Christine is the Devil in disguise. Christine is extremely possessive, jealous, powerful, vindictive, indestructible and kills those who cross her line. Besides, this diabolic car is not only possessed, it also can do something that no other car can: to fix itself, no matter how damaged it is. It would be great if in real life cars could fix themselves like Christine. That'd save a great deal of money. But without an evil soul, of course.The image of Christine with its lights on in the middle of the night running fast is spooky and remarkable. And the scene at night with Christine on fire and chasing one of the bullies, running over and burning him is scary.How can Christine possibly be so evil is something I really haven't the foggiest idea or how she is equipped with such a vicious nature. Nevertheless, it is one heck of a car: the 1958 Plymouth Fury is a fine piece of machinery and one of the most beautiful American cars of its time and even of all time, without the visually shocking looks of an Edsel, for example.Christine is said to possess those who own her and that's what happens with Arnie Cunnigham: from a shy boy, he becomes rude, possessed, totally insane and quite aggressive too. His compulsive obsession for Christine becomes so excessive that it leads to his death at the end. Christine practically becomes his ""girlfriend"", the ""girl"" of his life.Even so, it is sad to think how so many of these gorgeous cars must have been destroyed during filming. No wonder these cars's fans got so upset about that.The actors are generally okay for their roles, even if they're not exceptionally talented ones. One surprise here is to see a young, beautiful and completely different-looking Alexandra Paul in the role of Leigh Cabot. I know her better as Stephanie Holden from the popular TV series 'Baywatch'.The film also has some good oldie songs, such as ""Bad to the bone"" and ""Born to be wild"".",Christine

There are fantastic metaphors in this story that are unique to the American experience shaped in car culture and rock'n'roll. Give Steven King credit for putting into a pulp horror tale shining glorious moments, the story within Christine is quite powerful and touching. Although the book only hints at it and the movie skips it all together, it's simply a coming of age story framed within the construct of a boy's first car, and that car just happens to be evil- this concept contains so much dormant energy and as yet no one has figured out a way to tap into that energy. Hurry up and make a better version of this movie you jive turkeys.",Christine
106,virek213,Possessive And Possessed,8,31 August 2007,"Stephen King has been a household name for the horror genre seemingly for forever. His novels have, not surprisingly, provided considerable material for films. At least two (CARRIE; THE SHINING) are considered to be masterworks, while many others have been surprising clinkers (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE; PET SEMETARY). CHRISTINE, an adaptation of King that came out in theaters only eleven months after the book's first printing, is one of the better King adaptations; for while it is not a complete masterpiece, at the very least it provides enough scares and suspense without resorting to the graphic violence that has so often plagued the horror film since the end of the 1970s.Although the novel's setting has been changed from western Pennsylvania to southern California in the film, the basic spirit of the novel remains intact, as does the year it's set in--1978. Keith Gordon is the gawky high school teenager who manages to fall head over heals for a 1957 ""rustbucket"" of a Plymouth that the owner (Roberts Blossom) calls Christine. Lacking self-esteem, and often the target of a group of bullies in school, he presses forward with buying this seemingly decrepit piece of automotive machinery, despite the extreme protestations of his family, and even his closest friend (John Stockwell). In short order, Gordon manages to restore Christine almost to the condition in which it came off the assembly line in Detroit--complete with a radio that plays only the ""good stuff"" from the 50s.But what nobody realizes is that Christine is both possessive and possessed. An evil force resides beneath Christine's chassis, and it makes no bones about what it'll do to anyone who gets between it and Gordon. Gordon's new-found girlfriend (Alexandra Paul) almost chokes to death on a hamburger while inside the car; the uncouth garage owner (Robert Prosky) at whose establishment Gordon has kept his '57 jewel dies in it; and several of Gordon's high school tormentors bite the dust at the hands of Christine. A tough-nosed cop (Harry Dean Stanton) tries to connect Gordon to these horrible events, but has only circumstantial evidence. Finally, in fear of their own lives, Stockwell and Paul confront Christine inside Prosky's abandoned garage, hoping to somehow get Gordon out of the car's evil grasp.Apart from a slight excess of profanity in the script (and this is merely a small caveat), CHRISTINE is an atmospheric film, chock full of suspense, thanks to the solid direction of John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN; THE FOG). In contrast to most other King adaptations to come, and the vast majority of Carpenter's own output following it, CHRISTINE relies on plot and tension, with its suburban setting being the perfect place for the terror unleashed during the night. The violence, for the most part, is implied in the Hitchcock tradition; there is only a limited amount of blood and gore. Stockwell and Paul do great supporting work; and while Gordon's performance as the high school kid who becomes possessed is a bit less sympathetic than he should be, it still works for the story. Carpenter's and Howarth's synthesizer-dominated score ups the film's suspense quotient; and the ploy of using a lot of 1950s rock and roll on the soundtrack is very much in keeping with the spirit of King's novel.While CHRISTINE does fall just slightly short of the masterpiece status attained by CARRIE and THE SHINING, one could do far worse, in the horror genre in general and King in particular, than to watch this film. It had become a rarity by the 1980s for a horror film to be anything more than a matter of how much gratuitous sex, violence, and bad acting could be put on the big screen. CHRISTINE eschews that for something far superior: great, suspenseful, and terrifying cinema.",Christine
107,gigan-92,"""It's the car, Arnie.""",10,20 March 2012,"One of my all time favorite horror films, and for many a good reason. Based on A Stephen King novel, as if that already didn't set up how great its going to be, the basic premise is that a young soon to be high school graduate finds love with a 19658 bright red and white Plymouth Fury, and the car loves him right back in a haunting way. One of the highlights of the movie is its spectacular cast. John Stockwell and Alexandra Paul give very human performances, not overly cliché ones, making these characters feel as if they're people you now. Harry Dean Stanton also stars, always enjoyable, and who didn't love Robert Prosky as Darnell? He definitely came off as a hard-ass, but had something softer at the core. The most awesome performance in the film was Keith Gordon because you this very believable and sadistic transformation thru the course of the movie. Though obviously a nerd-esque character, you still very connected to him and that is definitely the strongest aspect of the movie.The cinematography is the gorgeous low-key lighting Carpenter loves to use. The way the camera captures the images creates a very chilling mood throughout. Another highlight of the film is the music. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth do it again, delivering a very ominous and fitting score. It's one of his greatest works. The film also makes use of some great classics, giving the film a true nostalgic feel. I'll always love ""Christine"".",Christine
108,Min111,That car is very terrifying,5,18 January 2019,"This movie is underrated if you ask me. I've seen many other Stephen King's flicks, but I always see the movie, Christine, ranked amongst the bottom, and I don't understand why because it's a really good movie, most certainly an underrated one. Once the movie starts, it gets better and better with every sequence. Christine, the car, is very terrifying. When it comes to possessing people, no one does it any better than Christine. What I love the most about this movie is that it's all about Christine, and then, everything else comes right afterwards. The most scary part is that we don't know much about Christine - how Christine came in the first place. I also like the soundtrack of this movie - flows pretty well. I could watch this again if I wanted too.",Christine
109,Peach-2,John Carpenter rules!!,8,22 November 1998,"John Carpenter's Christine is one of the best films made from an original Stephen King story. Carpenter has his own touches and the film has a great atmosphere. The use of old rock-n-roll has never been spookier. The scenes of seeing the car coming over the horizon with the bright lights on are amazingly well done. The idea of seeing your own death coming is very gripping and had me on the edge. The car coming down the road on fire is unforgettable. Roberts Blossom is very good in a brief scene when selling the car to Keith Gordon. Once again Carpenter and Alan Howarth do a great job on the score. The cinematography from Donald Morgan is brilliant. This movie does it with atmosphere and very little gore. The concept of a killer automobile is a litte goofy, but King pulled it off fine in his novel. Carpenter has done a great job with the film.",Christine

111,apryla-58795,Preposterous...but I loved it!,10,8 December 2018,This was so good. I wish they made more movies like this. I was into it from start to finish. I was surprised to see Kelly Preston in this. She looked so young! Also Harry Dean Stanton looked 100 years old back THEN! Alexandra Paul from Baywatch?! So funny! She looked so young too.I would highly recommend this. Gotta love a good underdog story where the bullies get what's coming to them. It's not really scary; it's more that it's a bit creepy.The only negative is the one high school bully has Wolverine type sideburns...he's supposed to be in high school! Why didn't they cast an actor who actually looked like they could be in high school? That was unrealistic looking but other than that the movie was great!,Christine
112,jhaggardjr,Effective thriller,8,29 January 2001,"""Christine"" comes from the minds of two top talents in the horror department: writer Stephen King and director John Carpenter. King wrote the novel that this movie is based on and Carpenter, the man who directed the classic slasher film ""Halloween"", brought the film to life. Some of the good movies based on a King novel include ""Carrie"", ""Cujo"", and ""Misery"". Besides ""Halloween"", other good Carpenter movies include ""The Fog"" and ""Starman"". I'm adding ""Christine"" on to both of their lists of good movies. This is a very effective horror-thriller about a '58 Plymouth automobile with a killer mind of its own that takes possession of its new owner, a nerdy teenager who starts off wimpy at first but slowly turns mad after buying the car. As the movie progresses, the kid starts to act more and more obsessive of his car, pushing his family and friends away from him. ""Christine"" isn't a gruesome film which makes it all the more effective, and has good performances from the cast. Even though ""Christine"" isn't a great movie, it's a very entertaining one.*** (out of four)",Christine

It's stylish, full of good music, acted good enough and obviously made with a lot of love. It maybe doesn't justify enough being known as a horror being more of a thriller, but it still doesn't make it any less valuable and I can say it deserves the renown it get's. It's one of Carpenter's better movies :) 8/10 from me and a warm recommendation! ;)",Christine
114,p-jonsson,I liked it better than I thought I would,6,17 November 2014,"I was not sure whether this movie was my type of movie or not. I have not read the book and, even though it is considered one of the classic horror movies, I have kind of put off watching it expecting not to like it. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.As I wrote I have not read the book and thus I do not know how well the movie interprets the book. In my experience it is usually best, when it comes to movies based on books, not to have read the book though.The story is probably well known by most fans of the genre. To me it was well implemented. Fairly predictable but still enjoyable to watch. Keith Gordon characterized Arnie Cunningham very well as far as I am concerned. His journey from quiet nerd to insane madman was quite well done and at the end he flipped between looking almost normal to madly possessed with an ease that was almost scary.I did like the car as well. As a person that have always liked American cars I have to say that it is a beautiful car if nothing else. Also I actually found myself sympathizing with the car for a good chunk of the movie. Those assholes that terrorized Arnie truly deserved what they got. Then of course it got out of hand when the cars influence on Arnie took on more sinister proportions.The ending was a bit disappointing though. It felt rushed and unintelligent. Up until then both Arnie and the car had shown evidence of some intelligence. That went out of the picture in the last couple of scenes with the car first behaving like a bull with its balls in a tight squeeze and then like it was drugged allowing a slow moving Caterpillar to just move up behind it and start to trash it. That was rather disappointing and it is a star less for that alone.Otherwise I am not unhappy that I spent two hours of my life on this movie.",Christine
115,theshadow908,Classic horror film.,8,2 March 2006,"Christine is a film that's impossible for me not to love. Stephen King's book is one of my favourites, and I think John Carpenter is a great director. Christine tells the story of a geeky teen who spends his college fund on a busted up car from the 50's, and is determined to fix it up. Little does he know that the car contains an evil entity that possesses him more and more as time goes on. Those around him think it's obsession, but when bodies start to pile up, they realize it's much worse.John Carpenter knows how to make a good horror movie. Using the right angles, the right style, add on to that his chilling music, and it makes another classic Carpenter creation. Of course, the movie is changed quite a bit from the novel, but Carpenter does it in a way that keeps the spirit of the novel while making it sensible as a film. One of my favourite changes is changing the car from a haunted vehicle to a vehicle driven by an unknown force. Another interesting thing about this movie is how human the car seems to be. The songs that play on its radio is a form of communication with human beings. The car actually displays love, rage, and jealousy. It's really neat to see a love triangle unfold between the teen, his girlfriend, and his car.All of the actors do well in their roles. Keith Gordon was really believable as Arnie, and Harry Dean Stanton was good as the detective. This is really one of those horror films that you can appreciate and enjoy every time you watch it. John Carpenter and Stephen King are genius's of their genre.8/10",Christine
116,akshatmahajan,Good in almost every aspect,8,28 July 2021,"From last few days, I have been watching John Carpenter's movie. I read alot about this movie and watched it. I liked the idea of the movie and it was new concept for that time (based on Stephen King's novel). For your info, this movie is now considered cult classic like Carpenter's other movies.For me, the movie was nicely made. It had elements of darkness, horror and tense, all blended perfectly. There are some good tense scenes. The suspense is also nicely built up and there are some surprises also.If we talk about performances, everyone did their job nicely. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween and The Thing. I didn't find any problem with the pacing.Overall, the movie is good and different for it's time. I will be different experience for you.P. S. Indian movie, Tarzan: The Wonder Car is loosely based on this movie and had manu scenes copied from this movie.",Christine
117,jayjaycee,Good ol killing car flick,7,22 October 2020,"""Christine"" is a 1983 horror thriller directed by John Carpenter starring Keith Gordon and John Stockwell.
⚪
All in all, this collaboration of two horror masterminds accelerates extremely fast and gives us the most important components of the iconic yet undeniably hilarious King novel, but even if it drives very close to it, many details fall by the wayside and it doesn't really manage to match the atmosphere of its source material or the other works of the legendary director, nevertheless, it delivers solid entertainment and a surprisingly demonic performance by Keith Gordon that make it an acceptable end product.
⚪
For day twenty-one I dug up another classic that happens to be one of the first horror films I have ever seen. When I was around fourteen, I discovered the works of iconic author Stephen King who then easily became my favourite, and I can tell, I binge-read every single one of them, one after another. Since I was still a little, and somewhat easily intimidated boy, I started with the more harmless titles before I gradually more dared to consume his heavier stuff as well. After I have finished ""The Arena"" after Christmas and ""Running Man"" subsequently, I then purchased the novel ""Christine"" with the intention to watch the adaptation as well. I cannot deny that the idea behind the story of a homicidal, jealous vehicle is cheesy, but King did a great job writing this, as it is a captivating and wonderfully atmospheric coming of age tale with horror elements. It might not be his best work, but I still had an amazing time reading it. Hence I was excited to check out the movie realisation of John Carpenter, who was only one of those big names my father mentioned throughout, because, I got to admit, I haven't seen any of his films except ""The Fog"" at this time, and didn't even know about his signature style that revealed itself to me more than a year later when I watched ""Halloween"" for the very first time. To be honest, when I was a naïve, young boy, I liked this film here a lot, but now that my taste in movies and my ability to evaluate them has improved enormously, it of course has changed a lot. In fact, I wasn't even expecting that it would hold up to what I thought back in the day, nevertheless, I think that it is an enjoyable film in some unusual way. I was astonished to see how well-marked my knowledge about the book was and how many details I was able to recall more than five years after I have read it, that is why I was still able to compare it with what is shown in this film, and I got to say, Carpenter did a passable but yet underwhelming job adapting King's story. Verbose and extensively detailed story lines have been compressed and melted together to not go beyond the two-hour mark, and that is one of the film's severest issues. Even if the critical scenes are all there, the love for detail is missing and it rushes through them and makes it almost impossible to convey the tense and mysterious atmosphere the book eagerly built up. Yes, the distinct mood a film of that kind requires is missing, and for a film directed by the master of horror, the man whose second name is probably ""atmosphere"" (just kidding, his real second name is Howard), the total absence of an eerie ambience is baffling. It is a King film adaptation through and through, and there wasn't much space for Carpenter to put his mark on it. At times, you have that simple but effective score that underlines some scenes, but other than that there is nothing distinct that makes it feel like a JC work. Honestly, if I didn't know it, I never would guessed it that it was directed by him, it rather feels like a film that could take place in the same universe as De Palma's ""Carrie"". Nonetheless, there are some major aspects that make it watchable as hell. The whole comment on the ""men and their cars"" topic shows to advantage wonderfully. I don't know if it was intended, but I think that King mocked this whole concept deliberately. I mean, a nerdy boy becomes a total jerk as soon as he buys his very own car. Hilarious! Also, what kind of perversity is it to sexualise an inanimate machine and at the same time objectify women? You know what I mean? This whole strange curiosity is one of the pivotal factors of why the novel is so brilliant, and the film, regardless of all its narrative flaws, manages to point that out equally brilliantly. Furthermore, I think that Keith Gordon's demonic performance as protagonist Arnie Cunningham is criminally underappreciated. I mean, the boy goes from shy, awkward and intimidated to cold, diabolic and unpredictable in a well-paced and frightening manner. And it is not the sudden use of eyeliner that makes me come to that conclusion. Oh, and all the roles are excellently casted in general. From Gordon and John Stockwell as the two main characters, over Alexandra Paul as the love interest and William Ostrander as bully Buddy Repperton to veteran actor Roberts Blossom as the malign LeBay (fun fact: when I read the book, I always imagined the character to look like this actor, even if I didn't see the film at all), they fit their roles perfectly, and it is even more astonishing that the teenagers are all played by young adults (well, the oldest is twenty-four) and not by people in their late twenties. However, I still have some issues with the ending. It might be very close to the book, but there is one change that severely alters the whole situation and prevents it from having the devastating twist that made me exclaim in disbelief when I have read it: Arnie being present in the final confrontation. Not only was it ridiculous that he somewhat committed suicide in a dumb manoeuvre (what did he except to happen when he drives into a mainstay?), the whole scene is solely Christine being steamrolled. And I am probably not the only one who thinks that this is not at all a solution to stop it. Also, did they really expect us to not notice how the car suddenly changes from having transparent to blacked-out windshields whenever it is supposed to drive on its own? Well, aside from this, it is still a decent and somewhat enjoyable film that is hence important to me, because it reminds me of the good old, carefree times I had when I was younger. It convinces more with the feeling of nostalgia rather than with technical excellence, but sometimes we need exactly films like this.",Christine
118,jcbutthead86,"An Effective,Underrated Horror Classic. John Carpenter and Stephen King at their Best.",10,4 January 2013,"John Carpenter's Christine is an effective,well-made and underrated Horror Classic and was the first and only collaboration between John Carpenter and Stephen King. A great mixture of excellent direction,great characters,atmosphere and a wonderful Rock N'Roll soundtrack,Christine is Carpenter and King at their best,one of the best Stephen King adaptations and one of the best Horror films of the 80s.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name,Christine tells the story of a nerdy teen named Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon)who discovers a 1957 Red Plymouth named Christine and falls in love. Although wreaked and damaged,Arnie decides to by it and rebuild it. While Arnie rebuilds it,Arnie's best friend notices changes in Arnie's behavior and discovers that Christine is a car with a life of her own and will kill anyone that gets in the way of her and Arnie's relationship. Now,it's up to Dennis and Arnie's girlfriend Leigh(Alexandra Paul)to stop Christine and save Arnie before it's too late.Christine is an excellent Horror film because this film takes the concept of haunted car and makes it truly creepy and the film works because of the story,characters,suspense and atmosphere. While some people wouldn't find the idea of a haunted scary,Carpenter takes Stephen King's story and makes it frightening and believable where you feel like something in Christine can happen in the real world and that you're not safe or secure,where you feel like any character isn't safe from Christine's wrath,rage or fury. Christine is a character in the film that doesn't say a word in the film but has a evil presence that you feel like she's everywhere at anytime and can strike when she wants to and there's nothing you can do about it because she is powerful and in control. The film and story also seems to have,in my opinion a weird sense of humor and playfulness about itself,whether it's the dialog of the characters or dealing with Christine and how serious the characters are about the situation at hand with Christine,so while the film is downbeat at times,the film doesn't always take itself seriously. I also love how the film portrays teenagers and teenage life in the film,with the three main characters dealing friendships,parents,bullying,love or revenge or life in general,whether it's Arnie and Dennis' friendship or Arnie's troubled relationships with Leigh,his parents,his love for the car Christine or Arnie dealing with school bullies and the film doesn't sugarcoat it. The only other Stephen King Adaptation that I can compare to Christine and deals with teenagers is the Brian De Palma classic Carrie,because while both films have different story lines,both films deal with the concepts of teenage life,revenge and death. Both would make a good double feature. John Carpenter is a master and expert of dread suspense,terror and atmosphere and it is on full display in Christine. John Carpenter uses the Christine car to give the movie a sense of dread and fear every time she shows up,because you never know what Christine's going to do in certain situations and that's one of the things that adds to the terror,you are distracted by Christine's beauty as a car,yet we forget that she is pure evil. The presence and fear by Christine is felt throughout the film and not one character in the film can escape from Christine's brutality and vengeance. Horror fans maybe a little disappointed with the lack of blood and gore that's not shown in the film,but the film doesn't need it or require it because Christine like Carpenter's earlier classic Halloween relies on terror and suspense and Christine isn't dark,gloomy or gory like Carpenter's brilliant The Thing where everyone and everything is doomed at the end. Like I said before earlier Christine has a playfulness and sense of humor and after all the film is about a haunted car. Christine is a Horror film but is pretty light in comparison to Carpenter's early films. The ending of the film is great because it ends on a cliffhanger and will make viewers ask a lot of questions and wonder what will happen. The whole cast does a great job. Keith Gordon gives the best performance of his acting career as Arnie. Gordon is frightening and believable as Arnie and his transformation from awkward nerd to psycho is excellent and scary. John Stockwell is wonderful as Dennis,Arnie football jock best friend with Stockwell bringing depth to the role and has a good chemistry with Gordon. It's interesting that both Gordon and Stockwell both became film directors later on. Alexandra Paul does a great job as Leigh,the new girl in school who becomes Arnie's girl friend and hates Christine. Robert Prosky gives a fantastic performance as Will Darnell,an auto shop owner that Arnie works for. Harry Dean Stanton does a wonderful job as cop Detective Rudolph Junkins who's investigating Arnie and murders associated with Christine. Roberts Blossom is great and creepy as George LeBay the man who sells Christine to Arnie. Christine Belford(Regina Cunningham)and William Ostrander(Buddy Repperton)give good performances as well. Also look out for an early appearance by Kelly Preston(Roseanne).John Carpenter's direction in the film is excellent,with Carpenter always moving the camera and giving the film an energy and pace and giving the film a sense of terror and dread when Christine shows up. Great direction,John.The score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is effective and masterful and adds to the film. Another great Carpenter score. The film has a great Rock N'Roll soundtrack with songs like Bad To The Bone(George Thorogood and The Destoyers),Beast Of Burden(The Rolling Stones),Bony Moronie(Larry Williams),Come On,Let's Go(Ritchie Valens),Keep Knockin'(Little Richard),Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay(Danny & The Juniors),Not Fade Away(Buddy Holly and Tanya Tucker),Pledging My Love(Johnny Ace),Harlem Nocturne(The Viscounts),I Wonder Why(Dion & The Belmonts),We Belong Together(Robert & Johnny)and more.

I must have seen it at least half a dozen times, and I just rewatched it for the first time in at least 20-25 years. It has not aged gracefully. The movie is much slower than I remembered, and about as scary as an episode of Scooby Doo. The pacing is a bit odd, even reminding me a bit of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"". After a very slow start the villains in both movies suddenly go crazy at the drop of a hat, without much build up. Performances from the three leads are serviceable.

Stephen King's novel about the twisted love affair between a boy and his car gets transferred to the screen, courtesy of suspense master John Carpenter. Although lacking some of the more outré supernatural elements of the source material, this high-octane cinematic tune-up more than delivers the goods, horror-wise (Christine's midnight rampages will never be forgotten)--as well as being a sly exposé of the random cruelties within the high-school pecking order. Keith Gordon (who has gone on to become a stellar director in his own right, with films such as A Midnight Clear and Mother Night to his credit) gives a wonderfully controlled central performance. Carpenter's atmospheric original score is backed up by a well-chosen collection of rock classics, including George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" (the titular character's all-too-apt theme song).",Christine
121,Coffee_in_the_Clink,King and Carpenter at their peak. It's a shame that this was the source material,5,20 March 2020,"Good atmosphere, good performances. But instantly forgettable. That's how I felt after viewing ""Christine"". Not something I expected considering it came from Stephen King and John Carpenter. How did this happen? Simple. Because the source material just isn't that compelling. An evil car? That's boring. And didn't James Brolin already take on an evil, possessed car in the aptly-titled 1977 horror film ""The Car""? He certainly did. As inane as that one was, it's still a fun and enjoyable movie. Carpenter went ahead and directed ""Christine"" before King even released the novel. That's how hot King was in the early 1980s, and Carpenter was too, riding high after ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"" and ""The Thing"". So when you factor in all of that, two artists at their peak, this is very disappointing. It just isn't frightening, and I am not surprised to learn that Carpenter had very little interest in this film. He saw it as a job, rather than a project. I quote him from a 2015 interview: ""It just wasn't very frightening. But it was something I needed to do at that time for my career."" Carpenter certainly tries his damnedest. You can feel it in the great atmosphere, and the scenes that are meant to evoke tension and suspense are done as well as they possibly could be. It just doesn't have a payday because the horror is a stupid, possessed heap of metal. It just didn't do it for me. It's a shame that this was the Stephen King film that Carpenter ended up making. There's plenty more in King's oeuvre that would have been worthy of Carpenter's hand. There are some positives; Keith Gordon and John Stockwell are exceptional, and Carpenter really portrays a nostalgia for the 1950s. This is set in the '70s, but strangely you would think at times that the film is set twenty years earlier. I guess that's the power of Christine and her bopping radio.",Christine

124,ryan-10075,Pretty Good Killer Car Flick,7,5 November 2019,"Great director John Carpenter really does show his skills as a director of horror here in this 1983 classic originally penned by Stephen King. This much like another 1983 King film CUJO could have been embarrassingly bad, but due to good scripts and more than capable directors they are classics. Having read the novel there are some big differences between the two, but I do believe that Carpenter does a great job in making a film as effective as the novel.Right from the beginning of the film we hear the rumblings of the car Christine which is a 1958 Plymouth Fury. Man, she's a beautiful car and would totally love to own one. Problem is people would probably think I was trying to kill them!Arnie Cunningham (really great performance from Keith Gordon) is a bit of a nerd, but has a real good buddy in Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) who's a jock playing for the high school football team. I was very glad to see that yes in reality nerds and jocks actually can not only co-exist they can even hang out together. Arnie comes across a 1958 Plymouth Fury that he finds out is named Christine. He buys it, but has to store it at Darnell's (Robert Prosky) due to his parents desire to not have it at their home. Arnie rebuilds the car and we the audience come to learn (not that you didn't already know from the opening scene on the assembly line) that Christine may have a life of her own and may also be changing Arnie for the worse.Carpenter really does a great job in placing you in the high school scene as the kids seem to have some fresh, good dialogue. Also, there is a band of bullies lead by Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) who in my mind is a good villain and someone you just can not like. Really have always loved the scene during shop class where Arnie and Buddy have a confrontation.Pretty good cast that also includes Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot, Harry Dean Stanton as Det. Junkins and Kelly Preston as Roseanne.",Christine
125,talisencrw,"Second-tier (great, just not perfect) Carpenter, and one of the finer Stephen King filmic adaptations!",9,10 April 2016,"One of the most intriguing coming-of-age stories in cinema, and this tends to be overlooked, both as a Stephen King story and horror film, in place of the more sensationalized frolic and mayhem of works such as 'The Shining', 'Carrie', 'Misery' and 'The Shawshank Redemption', which is a crying shame, because: a) John Carpenter is probably the finest director (at least Top 3) ever involved with King adaptations; and b) it perfectly conceptualizes, like earlier short experimental films by the likes of Kenneth Anger, the downright uncomfortable sleaziness and fetishism that has existed, mainly in America, between men and their cars.Keith Gordon does some really fine acting here (as he did previously for Brian De Palma in 'Dressed to Kill') as all possible dynamics along the range from nerd to psycho. It's impressive that, while growing up in film, he obviously learned some of the tricks of the trade from such cinematic greats (at least of American film of the past 50 years) and ended up becoming a decent film helmer himself.9/10 for me; Grade A Carpenter. It simply isn't top-tier for me, of his oeuvre, because I know he, like Sir Alfred Hitchcock, De Palma and other greats, is capable of cinematic perfection (Halloween, The Thing, etc.).",Christine

127,leavymusic-2,You keep a knocking but you can't come in.,7,4 January 2020,"This is a well made horror/Fantasy picture, John Carpenter directs and puts his talent even into the music score, which is classic Carpenter old school synth based vibe, among also the presence of many 1950's rock n roll classic tracks, to give you a vibe of the car 'Christine' Period of manufacture during the 1950's.
Of course there are a few flaws here and there, but it's a addictive watch, with many modern horrors churned out in recent years which go straight to Netflix streaming service, this 1980's film has a high a look of high production value, especially when comparing it to so many modern digital movies from 2000 onwards. , I love the grain in the film and the non CGI, it has great special effects never the less.
I think it stands up as one of Carpenters better features along with The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13. It's perhaps not quite as good, but still it seems to have aged well. Good fun, if you like a car based film with mind of its own.",Christine

129,RhapsodyReviews,Great Story Brought Down by Bad Acting,7,16 October 2019,"Review:
'Christine' is an American supernatural-thriller film directed by John Carpenter. It is based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. I have only seen this movie once, and after watching it I wasn't sure how I left about it. It's been in my mind and I've bee thinking about it for that last couple days and the more I think about it the more I like it.
The movie follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon), his friends, Dennis Guilder and Leigh Cabot (John Stockwell and Alexandra Paul) after Arnie buys a vintage 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine, a car that seems to have a jealous, possessive personality and a mind of its own.
The car is better character than any of the people in this movie, sad to say. I didn't like any of the kids in this film. It's frustrating watching a movie like this and you don't care what happens to any of the characters. There are no stacks at that point and you're just watching a supernatural car go on a killing spree. I'm not trying to blame it on the writing, I want to make that clear. I think this movie has a very strong script and story, it's the acting all around that falls short.
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this before, but the music choices were interesting since most of it came from artists of the 1950's who suffered untimely, tragic deaths, look it up. I think this movie is so good because of John Carpenter. It's a ridiculous concept that only he could get a hold of and bring it together for film. Stephen King has a lot of good stories that are just messed up when they are made into films, but not Christine. King should just let Carpenter, George A. Romero, or nowadays Mike Flanagan do all his movies from now on.
Overall, this is a fun movie, but gets brought down by the lack of acting capabilities. You can still have fun with it, and you will be engaged the whole time watching, especially when Christine is on screen.
3.5/5",Christine
130,MichaelMRamey,Treat Your Cars Right!,7,4 October 2018,"I'm surprised I like this and the reason it took me so long to watch was because of the outlandish concept. Christine was surprisingly good, with a good cast and likeable characters. I was worried about the killer car storyline, but it does become more about the people involved than anything, especially the change of Arnie from need to a James Deen-esq psychopath. That is a character arc you don't often see in films. A Stephen King classic!",Christine

They have made insanely iconic and classic works that people love and this movie is now just that, iconic.If you havnt seen this I would highly suggest it. I'm a 80s film nut and a car nut.

132,chvylvr80,This is my favorite movie of all time!,10,3 March 2002,"Christine is a cinematic masterpiece that certifies the genius of both Stephen King and John Carpenter. Christine is a 1958 Plymouth Fury Sport Coupe with a bad attitude. Keith Gordon does a fantastic job of playing the nerdy Arnie Cunningham and John Stockwell does a great job playing Arnie's jock friend Dennis Guilder. In fact everyone in the film is perfectly cast and is exactly how I envisioned them in the book. This movie has got to be one of the greatest book adaptations that I have ever seen and with a few omissions bring the book to bright red life. In a way, this movie is kind of a love story and the love that Christine and Arnie have for each other is strong. An added plus to this film is a great oldies soundtrack that unfortunatly is not available for sale. John Carpenter's musical score is eerie even for him and adds to the suspense and atmosphere of the film. Harry Dean Stanton makes a small but memorable performance as Rudolph Junkins, the streetwise cop who suspects not everything is kosher with Arnie's car. On a side note, every engine should sound like Christine's Golden Commando V-8. Her exhaust note is music to my ears. Anyway, see the movie, see it now, and then go back to imdb and rate this movie a ten. Anything less would be a crime against humanity. Check out the book too. It's great!",Christine

134,azanti0029,One of the stronger Stephen King adaptions and good John Carpenter,8,6 November 2017,"Despite John Carpenter is one of my favourite directors of horror he's had a pretty hit and miss career from the late 1980's onwards, however, this challenging Stephen King adaptation is one of his best. Christine, named after the car which is the star of the show is a red and white 1950's Plymouth fury. The car possesses, however, owns it and becomes as jealous as the most dangerous of girlfriends. It sets its sights on young high school geek Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon in one of his best performances) Arnie is best friends with High School Jock Dennis (John Stockwell)A victim of serious bullying, Dennis intervenes when Buddy Reperton (an excellent William Ostrander) has a knife to Arnie's throat. When Arnie purchases the Christine from the owner, the car becomes his focus in life. As he transforms the car back from the dead, so the car transforms his confidence and Arnie succeeds in dating High School heartthrob Leigh (Alexandra Paul) despite his best friend being interested in her affections. Arnie stores and repairs his car at the garage of no bullshit owner Will Darnell (played by old hand Robert Prosky. When Buddy Reperton is expelled, he and his gang exact their revenge on the car but the car has a strong sense of self- preservation and soon it and Arnie exact their revenge. Can Dennis save his friend from the car's evil before its too late?Christine still holds up well as an eighties horror film. What makes the movie so strong here is Carpenters direction and the performances he gets from his leads especially Stockwell and frankly just an incredible performance from a very Keith Gordon. Back in the days when horror films depended more on a sense of fear that outright gore this film comes highly recommended and was pleased to see it still holds up well after all these years and remains as one of Carpenters best. It may well not be a patch on the book, which is far more detailed but those looking for a good old school horror film will not be disappointed.",Christine
135,jamiecostelo58,Good adaptation of the Stephen King novel,8,16 December 2006,"John Carpenter displays a fine version of the Stephen King novel, where an unusual tale of love and lust for a huge expanse of metal comes to the fray.Arnie Cunningham is greatly portrayed by Keith Gordon, and watching him turn from the local school wimp to a hard-edged individual who won't take flak from anyone is rather pleasing.Scenes in which 'Christine' come to life are displayed to chilling effect, and is actually quite believable. People who have not witnessed this film will be surprised at the effects. The aptly named Plymouth Fury was the vehicle used as Christine; this car certainly had a lot of Fury! Nobody can get in the way of Christine as she and Arnie reign terror upon those who have made his life miserable. Shocking scenes abound mixed with wonderful ominous music will send even the most laid back viewer into a sense of surprise.Upon first viewing of this movie, I was not disappointed. John Carpenter unleashes a terrifying hell on earth where the uncontrollable wrath of a young man and his car never fails to send shivers down the spine. An engaging film that could be one of the best horror-thrillers of the 1980s. Great!",Christine

It's a fairly scary film, but i wasn't as impressed as I've been with other Carpenter films, or Steven King stories for that sake. This is probably a better book than film.The acting was good, and the Carpenter way of creating thrills was definitely there. But I also felt the story was a little stiff and predictable. The start was fun, the middle was a little boring, and I really liked the ending. I give this movie a 6/10. Carpenter has admitted to make this film, because it was the only thing available, and i must say it show from time to time. I would advice you to see John Carpenter other films.",Christine
137,Minus_The_Beer,She Drives Me Crazy,8,14 February 2011,"Poor Arnie just can't catch a break. He's the school's prototypical nerd and resident punching bag for his meathead classmates. Even worse, he can't get a date, can't get his locker open and can't beat his mom at Scrabble. All of that changes the day he meets Christine. Sure, Christine is a little rough on the eyes and she's been around the block more than a few times, but she's got a great body and really knows how to ride. Problem is, Christine has a hot temper and her loyalty to Arnie is matched only by her thirst for blood. Christine is no ordinary girl; she's a 1958 Plymouth Fury and she's taking Arnie for the ride of his life.Keith Gordon plays no more Mr. Nice Guy Arnie Cunningham and watching his transformation from awkward geek to cocky hothead is half of the film's fun. The other half, of course, is watching the film's titular character mow down its owner's classmates in varied grisly fashion. Director John Carpenter - already a certified Master of Horror by this point - steers the course steadily with ample character build-up, signature creepy music and, of course, mounting tension. You sort of forget the ridiculousness of the premise because not only does Carpenter pull out all the stops, but also because Keith Gordon sells his character so well. Of course, the true star of the show, Christine (reportedly played by 21 different cars) steals the thunder with some of the more memorable moments being her birth (witness George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" before it was trite and clichéd) and her own stop-motion rebuilding which had to be painstaking yet entertaining to try to film. There are things in the film that you simply won't see elsewhere, guaranteed.Truth be told, ""Christine"" isn't without a few speed bumps. In all honesty, it's a little long-winded and there's this nagging feeling by the end of it all that something is missing. More specifically, we never quite find out why Christine is the way she is. Does she need an oil change? Does she have a tear in her upholstery? The film loses a bit of credibility by not at least trying to establish a reason for Christine's madness. Even still, it's a thoroughly entertaining film if you love revenge-fantasies and/or cars. At the very least, it's one of the best Stephen King adaptations amidst some pretty mediocre fare. It won't make you fear muscle cars, but maybe you'll think twice about defecating on someone's dashboard ever again.",Christine

Can be really cheesy sometimes, certain characters can be wildly cliche
Action scenes lack a climactic finish, all tension and no release
You have to spend time with many characters you dont care about at all, or characters that show up for 5 minutes and have little effect on the storyBest part: car on fire, really cool imagery, good feats of endurance for the car
Worst part: car making someone choke on a piece of sandwich",Christine

140,FrankBooth_DeLarge,One of the better Stephen King movies,8,4 February 2005,"Christine is one of the better Stephen King movies. It isn't as great as The Shining, but it sure is better than Children of the Corn. This is directed by horror movie director John Carpenter. He is a good director and his directing skills are very effective in this movie. I'm not as familiar with the cast members, but I know that the older man from Home Alone plays a car salesman in this movie, and a woman who eventually goes on to do Baywatch plays the Highschool hottie in this movie. This has plenty of Stephen King trademarks, and has a good first half. The music is good, it is a mix of classic rock music and John Carpenter's orchestrated score, both adding plenty of effect to the movie.This movie is pretty weird, but it isn't terrifying like some of the other King films. The age group for this is probably ages 12 and up, even though kids younger than that can probably handle it.There is a good story line in this movie, and it tries its hardest to follow the novel. I'd say this is worth watching, it is one of the better King adaptations, and the acting is good.",Christine
141,jbartelone,"Not Quite Classic, But Still Very Good",7,3 May 2008,"Christine, tells the story of a demoniacally possessed car that kills those in its path when tormented, and other times for no reason at all. The film has a strong undertone quality in bringing Stephen King's novel to the screen. Very convincing performances by lead actors, the geeky Keith Gordon, and his best friend, high school jock, John Stockwell make the film very watchable.The plot is predictable. A bullied teen becomes possessed and obsessed with the ""killer"" car and begins to exhibit traits of a dramatic personality change. Teen and car literally become ""one of the same"" as ""Arnie"" turns from bullied victim to withdrawn narcissist. However, it is the car that becomes Arnie's passion and narcissist object. ""Arnie"" becomes more and more isolated and short-tempered with his friends as the car seeks out Arnie's enemies, hell-bent on destroying them.One of the masters of suspense, John Carpenter, did very well in transforming King's novel to the screen. The characters and mood all fit. A less noticed role, which is very well done, is the concern of Arnie's Mother, watching what her son has become, and realizing that she can't do anything about it. Had this film been put in the hands of a less experienced director, it could have easily been a B-grade average flick. But Carpenter's direction, and Gordon's performance, make this film memorable.It's not anywhere near as scary or suspenseful as Carpenter's most noted classic, Halloween. I don't know how you could make a killer car movie equal that. But ""Christine"" has enough strong characters and some good subtle moments, such as the wide array of 50's songs on ""her"" radio, along with Gordon's and Stockwell's acting, that provides viewers with a worthwhile film.A drawback is that the R-rated language is extreme in the uncut versions, and from reports, was ""forced"" into the picture to attract older theater patrons at the time of ""Christine's"" release. A rare example, where you could remove the bad language from this film and it does not hurt the storyline at all.",Christine

143,mbhgkmsgg,Horror done right,9,26 October 2020,"WOW! I'm extremely surprised by how much I liked this film. I have never been a fan of the horror genre and I have avoided watching horror for the most part. However, recently I have started to open up to the idea of getting more into horror films and I have been fascinated by John Carpenter as a director ever since I saw Big Trouble In Little China. Since it's Spooktober, and Netflix happened to have Christine in its catalog, I thought to myself, what better time to start getting into horror films.I'm glad I did. Christine surprised me in a big way. I ended up liking a proper horror film much more than I thought I ever would. The tension was perfectly crafted and the tone and the mood of the film was fantastic. At first, I thought that the second act was quite slow. However, once the movie finished, I realized how important the developments of that second act were. I also thought the way Christine (the car) was handled, was brilliant. I was never 100% sure as to what exactly it could do. From the very get-go, the movie gives little hints and ideas of what is to come and keeps you on the edge.As mentioned, I'm very glad I expanded my movie radar towards horror. I'm very eager to seek more horror of this era and I'm even more eager to see more of John Carpenter. Christine is a fantastic film that does horror exactly how I think that it should be done. Although there is a lot in the horror genre that doesn't interest me in the slightest, thanks to Christine, I won't be avoiding the genre any longer.",Christine
144,mitchell5954,My Least Favorite John Carpenter Film!,6,4 November 2013,"Christine is both one of my least favorite Stephen King stories, but also my least favorite John Carpenter film I have seen so far. I have not seen all of Carpenter's films, but from what I have seen, this is the one I enjoy the least. I do not think Christine is horrible, or even that bad, but I found it non-engaging. It is definitely not Stephen King's worst stories, but it is definitely not one of his best either.Christine stars Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham. He is a nerd who gets picked on and treated badly by everyone including his own parents. He has only one friend who is named Dennis, played by Jason Stockwell. He comes across an old beat-up car called Christine being sold by this old man. Despite being trashed and Dennis telling him not to he buys the car anyway and takes it to a shop to get it fixed. Little does Arnie know that Christine has a mind of her own and even kills people that are mean to Arnie. Slowly but surely Christine starts taking starts taking Arnie over to the point where he only care about Christine.The film does have some things going in its favor. The effects are decent. I like all the scenes with Christine, whether it'd killing people manipulating Arnie, or the scene where she puts herself back together, which is the best effect of the whole film. The premise of a killer car is a bit silly, but I thought it was fine as a b-movie idea, and I have seen far stranger ideas from Stephen King. . I also like that they kept why Christine is alive a mystery. There is an explanation in the book, but it is very underwhelming and cliché for horror films. Keeping Christine a mystery I think was the right way to go.However, there are many problems with the film. The first and biggest problem is that I do not like anybody including the main character, Arnie. Besides being a strait horror movie, this film is supposed to be a tragedy where this innocent kid gets possessed by this evil car and cannot live without it. The problem is that even before he gets the car I never cared for him. He seemed to be kind of an asshole himself. I know he has had a hard life, but all he does is complain about how bad his life is, which makes him look whiny. He hardly cares about his friend Dennis either, even before he gets Christine, despite trying to be a good friend.Dennis is a nice guy, but beyond that he is very bland and boring. Not to mention, the actor Jason Stockwell is a pretty bad at acting. I have not seen Jason in other films, but his performance is very wooden here. That is another problem with the film. Other than Arnie, nobody in the cast can act. The lead girl I do not care for either. I thought she was boring as well, and the actress is not that great at acting either. The other characters are not worth mentioning.Overall, Christine is an okay b-movie to watch as a time waster. I found it to be one of by lesser favorite Stephen King stories and definitely my least favorite Carpenter film. I like the kill scenes involving Christine, as well as the effects. However, there is not much else to this.",Christine
145,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Christine,7,24 August 2015,"If you've seen Christine and thought it was crap, ask yourself this – How could a movie about an obsessed car killing people because they got too attached to the car's owner be any better than Christine was? Though directed by a not-so-interested John Carpenter (apparently it was the only thing he was being offered at the time) Christine remains one of the most entertaining films in his filmography. The characters are all generic 80's cardboard cut-outs, but are well-defined enough to be relatable and believable. Keith Gordon's decent into madness due to his obsession with his beautiful new car Christine is well-handled, who becomes something of a deranged antagonist in the latter half of the film after we followed the movie through his and best friend John Stockwell's viewpoints. The closer Gordon gets to Christine, the further away he movies from his friend and family, and in doing so opens up the chance for the viewers to side with best friend Stockwell, who is apprehensive of Gordon's fixation with the car. In other worlds, the bullied geek loner we can all sympathise with becomes the guy we're all rooting to dieor well, see the error of his ways at least. Little does Gordon know Christine is as jealous as most women unnaturally are, and kills to stop people coming between her and Keith. By the time he discovers this, he doesn't care much. Why? Because he's now also a killer. Hell hath no fury like death on four wheels. Or something. The movie's best attributes (aside from Carpenter's funky soundtrack) is a number of thrilling scenes in which killer Christine chases and mows down her pray, sometimes with Keith Gordon in the driver's seat and sometimes without. There are a notable number of clever scenes, from where the car rebuilds herself after taking a beating to inventively killing a fat man by squashing him between the front seat and dashboard. The movie carries a sense of faux nostalgia – it was clearly made in a time where Americans, especially teenagers and young adults, thought of their cars as companions and people. Because of this the time in which the movie was set plays a big part. I could imagine myself at a drive-in cinema watching a film like Christine (much like how the characters do in the film) even though they were before my time. Plus, Christine is sexy as heck: Let's just say if she and I were alone in a garage, I'd strip bare whilst stroking and spanking her boot, before greasing up her exhaust pipe and – I'll stop there.Best Scene: Christine goes on rampage in the dead of the night in order to take out the leader of Gordon's bullies, and in doing so takes out an entire service station.",Christine
146,Tender-Flesh,Pleasure to burn,7,19 February 2009,"This is one of the few horror films created in a time when violent on screen deaths and super-gore were commonplace where we are given neither and yet still a healthy meat n potatoes, stick to your ribs film is what we get. I've watched this movie probably 10 times and haven't gotten sick of it yet.One of the things that I feel makes it enduring, much like previous Stephen King books that have been translated to film, is that it differs enough from the source material that, upon learning the plot of the novel, I find the film to be better. Ghostly happenings are eliminated from the storyline, leaving evil Christine to be a bad girl from her very birth. This is one of the better worm-that-turns films, with Arnie Cunningham transforming himself as he rebuilds Christine. Or, perhaps, it is his hard work in rebuilding her that allows her to rebuild him in a more fitting image as her new owner and driver. Little did John Carpenter know that he would be creating such an iconic figure with Christine. If you are lucky enough today to see an exact model of Christine or even a similar body type painted red, the car from this movie is the first thing you will think of. As a kid, after seeing the movie, I wanted a Christine of my own for years because I became obsessed with the chrome and the monstrous engine.Carpenter wisely chose mainly unknowns for his cast or older B movie actors. The car is the star, not the actors. This was back in the day before Carpenter went soft and he could really make a great film with spectacular pacing and masterful shots. His sparse, subtle musical interludes between classic rock n roll pieces are superb. The heavy synth score reminds me of a few light flavors of artists like Goblin. The best use of Carpenter's theme is set during the gas station attack where Christine is engulfed in fire, chasing the hapless bully, Buddy, down a deserted stretch of road. Unfortunately, that scene doesn't hold up all that well after all these years as if you are paying attention to the roadway, you'll see Christine isn't driving very fast while ablaze. That sort of kills the shot, but back when I first saw it, that scene left an imprint on me as one of the best horror scenes. As I said earlier, it's iconic.I've heard rumors about remakes and I'm sort of on the fence about that. Some humble advice I'd give to producers would be to hire someone like George Miller who knows his way around car chases. Make sure the car make, model, and color are the same, but maybe show some gory scenes this time. Not over the top nor with every death, but maybe one or two, like a tire tread rolling over and crushing a head or something. Hopefully, a remake will be a remake of this film and not the novel. I find this movie superior to the book in every way.",Christine
147,sdiner82,"Superior thriller, in the grand tradition of Val Lewton",9,21 August 2003,"In 1978, novice filmmaker John Carpenter wrote, directed and composed the score for a zero-budgeted independent horror film HALLOWEEN. Released with hardly a whisper, HALLOWEEN was brushed off by Variety as ""routine drive-in fare.""  But when it opened in New York City, a prescient critic for the Village Voice gave it a rave review.  The rest is history. Less than two years later, another independent filmmaker chose another holiday with eerie connotations, FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Although crudely done, derivative and awash in gore (by comparison, HALLOWEEN was virtually blood-free), the film delivered the shuddery goods. Unfortunately, the boxoffice blockbuster status of HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH--the first a certifiable classic, the second a cynical piece of trash--spawned a torrent of ripoffs. Most of them were miniscule-budgeted independent quickies, but an alarming number of them were reasonably financed, even bearing the distribution logo of a respected major-studio, with the added come-on of a Stephen King novel serving as its source. (This hybrid was generally as wretched as its independent counterparts.)  But King didn't come cheap; actors did.  After her quintet of screamfests, Jamie Lee Curtis, the then-unknown star of HALLOWEEN, cannily figured she'd paid her dues and moved into other ventures.  Poor, pretty Adrienne King, who played the Curtis-role in FRIDAY THE 13TH, didn't fare as well.  After demanding a salary raise for the sequel, Ms. King found herself relegated to a pre-credit cameo. Among the dozens of clones that polluted theatres for the next decade, however (and the sequels to HALLOWEEN and FRIDAY THE 13TH are now entering their third decade), one movie of genuine quality emerged--only to be somewhat buried (and sadly underrated) by the morass of ""slasher"" flicks that tarnished the '80s.  That film is CHRISTINE, a 1983 release that is as finely crafted, meticulously assembled, and gripping a thriller to come out of Hollywood since the output of Val Lewton (""Cat People,"" ""The Seventh Victim"") in his all-too-brief 1940s heyday. Yes, CHRISTINE was based on a Stephen King novel but its makers had the intelligence to cut out the novel's dreck, retain its haunting premise, and embellish its virtues. CHRISTINE is the name a bullied, lonely highschool nerd Arnie (Keith Gordon) gives to a battered 1958 Plymouth Fury he acquires at a used-car garage. Obviously feeling a psychological kinship with the abandoned vehicle, Arnie becomes obsessed with restoring the neglected car to its former gleaming red glory.  But as Christine's outward appearance undergoes a transformation thanks to Arnie's loving care, so does Arnie's. As his sole friend and protector, the warm-hearted, concerned school jock Dennis (John Stockwell, giving depth and quiet strength to a usually cliched character) looks on at first in bemusement, then in increasing alarm as Arnie is gradually transformed into an intimidating, kick-butt stud.  Moreover, Dennis takes notice of Arnie's increasing dependence, almost supernatural obsession with his beloved Christine.  But Christine has a mind of her own, including jealousy.  First, anyone who crosses Arnie's path is found mysteriously slain.  Then, when the highschool beauty (Alexandra Paul, years before her ""Baywatch"" days) becomes attracted to the newly refurbished Arnie, Christine swings into a jealous rampage and . . . CHRISTINE evokes its sense of dread by casting a searingly keen eye on the sights and sounds of small-town life, of carefully depicted relationships between teenagers and their parents, and the casual caring and cruelties of highschool life.  The film entirely eschews gore, cheap shocks and CGI special effects, and focuses almost imperceptibly on our most primal fears and joys--of growing up, of falling in love, the anguish of betrayal and abandonment--all the while with Christine observing all that transpires from the background--and zooming into the foreground when it comes to protecting her savior. Director John Carpenter's devious stylistic gifts quietly prick at our nerves--all is nuance (enhanced by a furtively roaming anamorphic Panaglide camera). CHRISTINE creates moments of such suspense that it reminded me of a few other unique thrillers of its era--and, by cross-referencing various movies (on IMDB) that came to mind, I was surprised that all shared one connecting link. First the films: SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME, a truly unnerving made-for-TV thriller starring Lauren Hutton as a woman terrorized in her swank high-rise apartment. This little-known gem was written and directed by John Carpenter prior to HALLOWEEN. SALEM'S LOT, Tobe Hooper's 2-part TV adaptation of Stephen King's vampire shocker, released theatrically overseas, featuring one of James Mason's last, most memorable performances. Wes Craven's CHILLER, made-for-TV before the filmmaker went on to commercial success with the ""Elm Street"" and ""Scream"" franchises. This top-quality trilogy--plus CHRISTINE--were all produced by Richard Kobritz.  His two Stephen King adaptations show he seems to understand and enhance King's work as no other filmmaker has to date, though many have tried and come a cropper (check out both versions of THE SHINING, Kubrick's bloated theatrical version and the tacky TV mini-series, and you'll see what I'm talking about). In an era when directors are instantly credited as the ""auteurs"" of their films, I'd suggest that the films of Mr. Kobritz--not unlike those of Val Lewton--show who the genuine ""auteur"" is.  In all of his films, the sense of foreboding is evoked through the subtlest of psychological and cinematic terms.  Somehow, these films all have the same unique ""touch.""  In all of the endings, the presence of evil is never entirely vanquished.  As in life, evil is always lurking, waiting to make its inevitable return in some form or other. I congratulate Mr. Kobritz for being perhaps the sole filmmaker to have learned the lessons of Lewton.",Christine
148,sdiner82,A suspense classic; the best of the Stephen King adaptations!,9,23 August 2003,"The astounding boxoffice success of two low-budgeted independent thrillers HALLOWEEN (1978) and FRIDAY THE 13TH (1980) gave new life to the genre, and for the next decade, theatres were flooded with a torrent of copycats.

150,latsblaster,Christine: In some aspects King's novel is adapted well,6,6 August 2008,"Well ... instead of doing what Peter Jackson later did with Tolkien's work, semi-master director Carpenter didn't try to make ""Christine"" just the same as King wrote it. So instead of doing everything wrong, he gets some scenes really right and his music is spellbinding.The film goes truly defensive and low key by not putting Roland LeBay in it, instead George LeBay (Roberts Blossom) becomes a double part in some way; borrowing characters traits from booth brothers portrayed in the novel. For Roberts Blossom, this part just might be one of many in his career, but seldom have I seen acting better done. I think he could have been booth LeBay brothers, with different costume and make up.Read the novel if you want to enjoy the film. To realize what it might miss. But don't blame Carpenter. He did an excellent job with a flawed script/adaptation.Rating: 6 of 10.",Christine
151,acdc_mp3,"Another Stephen King movie in which reading the book first, ruined the movie",5,12 June 2020,"I have known for a while that most of Stephen King books do not translate well to the screen. With the exception of ""Carrie"", ""Christine"" falls into that list of movies that include ""The Shining"" ""The Dead Zone"" and ""Pet Semetary""
I watched the movie well after I have read the book and while the movie was by no means bad, it just didn't hold water with me. I thought going into the movie there were some key roles that needed to be done very well for this movie to succeed. First and foremost was the casting of Arnie. Keith Gordon would have been a great selection except for one thing: While he totally looked the nerdy part and performed well, when he was supposed to be transformed into a rough, tough, and evil Arnie, I had to laugh at how un-menacing Gordon was. He was as intimidating as a labrador puppy. Another character I was not happy with was Will Darnell. From the second I read the book, the actor I had pegged for Will was Chuck Mitchell from Porky's. He would have been perfect as Will because that's exactly what he played in Porky's. I thought Alexandra Paul made a great Leigh other than the fact she towered over Arnie. I know adaptions of books often mean a change in the story line in the movie, but why didn't they just have Roland D. Lebay be the guy who sold the car instead of his brother who was exactly the way Roland was written in the book? It made no sense, but whatever. The rest of the cast was fine and didn't bring the movie down.If you haven't read the book, it really is a good movie in the sense it's fun watching an evil car cause mayhem. It does sadden me that this movie could have been so much better, and I do not watch it today unless I stumble across it. I'll stick with the book.Fun trivia: The gas station that was blown up was built in an onion field about 3 miles from where I grew up. I remember seeing them build it and I thought it was a weird place for a gas station. It is seeing land marks that I know well in the movie.",Christine
152,richard-wheeler,It's a possessed ZZ Tops!,8,30 November 2005,"It all started in Detroit in 1957. The car's bonnet mysteriously slammed on a worker's hand while he was checking the engine. And at 5 o' clock that afternoon, one of the worker's died in the car while listening to music.Later, two boys named Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) and Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who were both victims of verbal and physical bullying caught sight of an old red ZZ Tops and Arnie was the one to check it out. Arnie sure did fall in love with it. When they to it's owner named George LeBay (Roberts Blossom), he told them that the car's name was Christine. Le Bay told Arnie about it's bad history when his brother's daughter was chocked to death in the car5. But anyways, Arnie bought the car $250.When Arnie came home with the car, his parents Regina and Michael (Christine Belford and Robert Darnell) disagreed with Arnie keeping the car due to hearing about the previous owner who died in the car from carbon monoxide. But Arnie insisted on keeping the car. And on the 9th of October 1979, Arnie fixed his car with junk at and from Darnelle's Auto Wrecking. There was a similar attachment with LeBay's brother and Christine as there was with Arnie and Christine. And you should've seen how the car looked when it was complete. BEAUTIFUL! That night, Dennis went to go check out the car, and when he tried to open it, the radio went off, Dennis ran away and then, the radio stopped playing. Now, this was the time when we knew the car had a life of it's own! On the following day, when Arnie rocked up at a football match. Christine made Dennis injure himself. And on the 5th of November, Dennis was in hospital.That evening, Arnie's girlfriend Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul) told Arnie that she hated the car. And when Arnie went out of the car, Leigh began to choke in the car while the radio played and everywhere in the car shone a bright white light. And when Arnie left his car inside Darnelle's Auto Wrecking, his bully Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) and his gang sneaked in and vandalized his car.The next day, Arnie was shocked to see what happened to his car. And that evening, Christine pulled herself back together. And Christine went after one of Buddy's mates who was involved with vandalizing her. He was Moochie Welch (Malcolm Danare). WOO! Moochie sure was spooked out! Christine chased Moochie into a junk yard and she mashed him into a dead end.On the 3rd of November, 1979. There were many complaints about Christine. And one evening, Christine followed Buddy about as he drove to a petrol station, she wrecked his car, and she caused a petrol explosion. She then chased him down the as she burnt with her headlights shining brightly. And, she ran him over and he burnt up. THAT'S RIGHT!! BURN IN HELL, FOOL!!!! When Christine came in, a guy who worked at the junkyard named Don Vandenberg (Stuart Charno) checked Christine out. Don foolishly got into the car, the door closed and it locked, the radio again turned on and the driver's seat which he was sitting on CRUSHED him! And the next morning, Christine was as good as new. WOW!!! Later on in the following evening, Dennis noticed that the car had done something to Arnie. He also saw that the car could steer by itself when Arnie let go of the steering wheel. Later, Dennis and Leigh set a trap for Christine at Darnelle's. He was going to crush her with a bulldozer. And SUDDENLY! Christine shot out from under from under a pile of garbage with her headlights shining their brightest! When Christine went for Leigh, she missed and began to ram the place down! And... SURPRIZE! Arnie was inside Christine. Christine again tried to run over Leigh, she crashed into a little joint of the place and Arnie died due to glass that got stuck inside his body. And finally, Dennis crushed Christine to kingdom come. And the next day, (Wow! I have said this phrase SO many times.) Christine had been compacted. And uh-oh! A song was heard playing from one of the builder's radio's. And, Christine began to form herself again.Christine had to have been one of the most interesting Stephen King films that I have ever seen due to having a possessed car, it effects the owner and those who are around him or her.And everyone knowing what sex the car is. That amused me when LeBay said that Christine smelt like pussy!And having a radio for a car's heart. This film was stunning, ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!!",Christine
153,lale-ba,CLASSIC CARPENTER TRASH,3,27 January 2018,"Story about a car killer is just one of those scripts that Carpenter built his career on, so the ''Christine'' fits in his portfolio like a glove.
All the elements of the '80s trash horror will be there, poor acting, lame plots and some fine movie aesthetics. 
However, the bad elements will overcome the good ones and not in a good manner, leaving this flick as one of the weaker ones legendary John signs.
Even if you are a automobile fan, ''Christine'' won't be a decent horror.",Christine
154,nathanschubach,I never cared about classic cars until now!,8,22 July 2012,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It's been out for years, a bunch of my friends have seen it many times over, but I just had to see it for myself. I thought it was great. The characters, the self- awareness of Christine, and the overall feel of terror that this town and group of people found themselves in with this jealous car ""alive"" and running amuck...it's the combination that makes a great horror movie. Hamburger-loving girlfriends beware! Christine plays no second fiddle!First off, the music is so important to the character of Christine. Old 50's rock & roll drives this car along its path of destruction, and it is so clear why Stephen King based the era of its construction of the '58 Plymouth Fury in Detroit as their economic downturns were upon them Christine was not a good spokes model for the car industry up there. Second, the special effects were phenomenal. The reversing crumpled fenders, the busted glass, the charred paint job that somehow found the perfect coat of the rarest color around 20 years after the car model originatedit's a fantasy and a nightmare combined into one.You need to own this movie. It's a delight. The characters are fully fleshed out (my favorite was the mechanic-shop owner, Will Darnell played by Robert Prosky) and very unique. It's too bad Arnie's parents were complete control freaks; they got the hardest job of trying to come between the car and its owner since the beginning. It really shows what car possession means. I would run out and purchase it on Blu Ray (if it becomes available), but until then, DVD will do.",Christine
155,kira02bit,Underwhelming misfire,4,21 May 2016,"Back in the mid-80s, novelist Stephen King was prolific and it seemed that barely a few months went by that a new film adaptation was not making its way to the screen, often with varying degrees of success. Christine was one of his more popular books of the time taking that old nutshell of the possessed car and making seem a whole lot more plausible and less silly than it should be. Hopes were raised when it was announced that horror director John Carpenter was helming the film. Carpenter was in a downswing and desperately needed a hit. After making the classic Halloween, Carpenter had a more modest success with the underrated The Fog. Unfortunately, his badly thought out Escape from NY tanked and his disastrous remake of The Thing (which now has an indefensible cult following) had been eviscerated by critics and imploded at the box office, so he was in need of a hit and King's novel offered fertile ground.Alas, it was not to be. King's story, told through the eyes of sensitive jock Dennis, recalling past tragic events involving his nerdy high school best friend Arnie and the dilapidated 1958 Plymouth Fury that Arnie falls in love with, buys and starts to restore with sinister impact, had a lot going for it. The story of a killer car is foolish, but King takes everything very seriously and populates his tale with sympathetic characters, has a good ear for how high schoolers talk, and has a strong number of requisite set pieces that stay in the memory long after one puts down the book. By contrast, Carpenter's film feels rushed, shallow and forgettable.Carpenter makes major changes in the plot and characters, ostensibly for budget purposes, and literally all of them function as detractions. Barring a couple of amazing shots of Christine's regenerative powers, the film looks cheap. Given how much Carpenter has excised, his film still has stretches of boredom. He seems incapable of garnering sympathy for his characters and even the villains come across as half-hearted cardboard nothings.His cast is not the best either. Veterans like Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Christine Belford are completely wasted. The gaggle of actors playing the bullying tormentors of Arnie seem entirely too old to be in high school. In the lead, Keith Gordon, who has been much better elsewhere, makes the leap from nerdy doormat to arrogant, self-confident and ultimately psychotic with such speed that the audience never has a any rooting interest in his plight. Truthfully, this could more be the fault of the rush in the screenplay than the actor. As our protagonist, Dennis, John Stockwell is goofy, awkward and off-putting. Alexandra Paul is cast as ""the prettiest girl in school"", which is debatable here, and she as well has been better elsewhere. There is not much time placed in developing her relationship with Arnie so that anyone buys how badly his transition has impacted her or the lengths that she is willing to go in the film's latter portion.Carpenter's changes in story often make no sense. Truthfully, in King's novel, Christine was fairly neutral. It was the rancid soul of her detestable former owner that possessed her and galvanized the action and change in Arnie. By omitting that character from the film and oddly mixing the characteristics with a still living character, Carpenter makes nonsense stew. Carpenter also omits the clever touch of how the souls of Christine's victims become trapped in the car and end up making diabolical passengers during attack scenes.Worst of all, King's novel features some stunning attack sequences set in a wintry Pennsylvania, including the snow drift attack on Arnie's chief tormentor and a terrific sequence where another character is attacked in their isolated home during the height of a blizzard, but Carpenter axes all such sequences for incredibly cheap affairs. The latter character dies in the film when he inexplicably decides to hop into the driver seat of the still-smoldering car that he just witnessed driving itself into a garage and the car seat pushes itself forward so far that it crushes him. An incredibly memorable sequence has been swapped out for an unintentional embarrassment.This all combines to make Christine a misfire. The studio obviously was not willing to cough up the budget necessary for a good film, the cast fails to inhabit their characters, and Carpenter was not inspired enough to do much with what he had, so the end result is an exceedingly mediocre testament of what might have been had anyone cared.",Christine

158,anchoreddown,Your definition of scary!,9,18 August 2012,"Christine is one of those movies that is only a horror tale by who made it. A possessed car may not be that scary to some people, but the fact that it's based off a Stephen King novel might scare a few people off. The movie is based around this 1957 Plymoth Fury that was maid in Detriot. The owner is consumed by the car that it takes the man's life. The man's brother who is played by Roberts Blossom later sells it to Arnie who is a young high school nerd kid from the late 70s. He is captivated and it consumes him. This movie skirts the edges of material that you may or may not consider to be horrific, yet in the same manner, it keeps you looking over your shoulder if your in the position of one of the high school bullies. The car itself acts like a stalker and the portrayal of it is really well done. Several visual effects shots were needed to give Christine a life-like for for the devil that she is. Most of these shots were very much cheaply done, yet are seamless when played back in movie-time. There is the argument that some can't see such a beautiful muscle car like her be menacing. The thrills are different for a movie like this with a different pace. Hopefully this will not make the reboot list of 80s movie hits because I certainly can't see this movie getting a remake. It's one of those pieces that is unique and has the quality of storytelling that comes only from the masters who create them.",Christine

162,jamesbourke59,When Complusion Leads To Obsession,10,7 April 2005,"Remember when you were young and movies where your only friend? Well such is a case in point when it comes to John Carpenter's ""Christine"" Now as a rule, and a longstanding one at that, I could never read a Stephen King novel but i could always find time to watch an adaptation of the same, if and when it either came to video as was the thing before the wonders of DVD or if it arrived at the local cinema.My personal highlights from the Stephen King Oeuvre are ""Silver Bullet"" if only to see the likes of Gary Busey and Everitt McGill ham it up beyond the call of duty. Stanley Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"" complete with a knockout performance from the maestro of barnstorming himself Mr Jack Nicholson, as we already know there have been so many translations from page to screen of everything and anything the king of horror writing has penned some good, some not so good.However, when it comes to ""Christine"" it was pitch perfect in every way, shape and form. Directed by John Carpenter, who has been hit and miss down through the years. A wonderful array of golden oldie classics playing throughout the movie itself, a truly wonderful script written by Bill Phillips, containing many a gem which still lingers in the mind even to this day.Which leads me finally to the actors, casting down to a tee, and as i said ably assisted by a good script, well drawn characters, of course from the mind of Stephen King, but brought to vivid life by the likes of Robert Prosky who appears as the junkyard owner Will Darnell, a true standout in the whole movie. Why even Roberts Blossom, think all the way back to Bob Clarks's take on Ed Gein ""Deranged"" the man still lends a sense of deadly menace to his character, even though his role is primarily a cameo role but in fairness quite pivotal in terms of progressing the story.However, those two being character parts, we need to see the story unfolds. We begin in prologue fashion, as we see upon fade in, superimposed, the year is 1957, We see a car assembly line, all the new cars are being overseen and given the once over by the foreman, from a distance we get our first glance of how beautiful and intoxicating ""Christine"" the car is to look at.Of course that illusion is soon shattered when firstly a foreman shatters his hand, then one of the workers decides to take a little rest and relaxation in the front seat, all the while smoking his cigar, when ash from the cigar drops onto the plastic covering, so it begins, and the true nature of ""Christine is revealed.Flash forward to present day and we see Arnie Cunningham the nerdish lead character played with aplomb by Keith Gordon, who would later go on to direct the really excellent ""The Chocolate War"" as well as many more. However when it comes to acting, Keith Gordon would never better what he had done prior to this or even after.We have all at one point, either been or have known someone like Arnie Cunningham, perennial book worm, not exactly a ladies man, but when he catches first glimpse of the wreck that will forever alter his very being, It is at that point we see that compulsion leads to obsession when Arnie falls under the spell of that 1958 Plymouth Fury.Watch as Arnie emerges from his shell, argues with his parents, something that he would never have done or even finds his first and last girlfriend. All this achieved upon the influence and presence of what would appear to be a car, but for teenager Arnie, it represents his first steps towards independence, but underneath the surface of it all we already know the motive and inevitable end.With wonderful turns by William Ostrader as chief bully Buddy Reperton and Malcolm Danare as Moochie, along with John Stockwell as Arnie's only friend Dennis and Alexandra Paul long before she donned the lifeguard bikini for Baywatch as Arnie's suffering girlfriend Lee.Watch and be amazed, time has not taken it's toll on John Carpenter's finest hour.",Christine

A car that can have feelings, defend itself, attack, kill, that's also pretty good. Of course Christine is not the only ""living car"" in movie history - Herbie would be another example - but Christine is way more possessive. Even beyond Christine herself, the film is great at showing what to exclusive loves can do to the lovers.Filming: average, very average. The images do their job like on any B-series but there are few above average shots. Except for the one of the burning Christine chasing one of her killers - a classic.Acting: the acting stinks. It's poor, it's sometimes hardly believable at all. I guess it gives a sense of freshness, of ""I hired pals from high school to do it"". But it's really below par, and makes the film less pleasurable to watch. Only the leading part, that of loser Arnie Cunninghma, is a bit credible, at times - but even he is not that good. At the end of the day it's either a few secondary parts - the garage owners - or more importantly, the car, that are the better acted parts.Directing: does the job, but nothing stunning.Editing: the pace is generally OK, does its job though nothing to write home about.Bottom-line: great story, would be well worth a remake with a better director, better filming, better actors - all of which should not be too difficult to get. Maybe they spent too much time / money / energy on the several cars needed for the film, and saved too much on the rest.",Christine
165,larrysmile1,Evil CAR makes for evil teenager,8,21 July 2002,"Now, there is not doubt about it!  The 1958 Plymouth Fury Sport Coupe, especially in red with a white roof, was one mean, boss machine.  And ""Christine"" was a car with a mean disposition.  Possessed by John Carpenter's magic, ""Christine"" tells the tale of a nerdy teenager Arnie Cunningham (played by a 22 year old Keith Gordon) who purchases this demon possessed machine and restores it (well, Christine basically restores herself) and transforms his own attitude from school campus worm to BMOC (Big Man on Campus).  Keith Gordon, now 41 years old today, gave a flawless performance.  He is totally believable as the meek, mild mannered teen who becomes a diabolical instrument of revenge against any person whom doesn't like ""Christine.""Keith's only real male pal is Dennis Guider, played by a 22 year old John Stockwell (real name: John Samuels, IV). Dennis is the typical football jock wearing his school colors on his letterman's jacket.  Texas born Stockwell plays a perfect straight side kick to the unpredictable Arnie Cunningham. Dennis stands by his friend and, in the end, is the man of the hour who saves the lovely heroine from the disaster of ""Christine.""Now, every teen movie requires the nerd to fall in love with the prettiest girl in school and that she also digs him!  This, of course, never happened in our own high schools.  But, in ""Christine"" beautiful 20 year old Alexandra Paul (of later Baywatch and Melrose Place fame) plays the teen angel role of Leigh Cabot.  Needless to say, she becomes enamored with Arnie, even though she could have any boy on that campus or any campus, and becomes his girlfriend, even though she won't ""go all the way"" at the drive-in!  But the love between Leigh and Arnie is not to be as the jealous ""Christine"" requires an ""exclusive"" love between the car and it's current driver, Arnie Cunningham.""Christine"" is also an actress in this movie.  Christine has a heart, a mind, and a soul.  Christine ""knows"" all that's going on inside her chassis and won't stand for sharing her ""man"" with another girl.  Christine is a ""killer.""  And, Christine can't be killed!  I read that as many as 16 - 20 1958 Plymouth Fury Sports Coupes were procured and destroyed in making this film.  What a waste!  This was one of Detroit's most classical body designs. Today's cars are ugly clones and can't compare to the boss cars of the 50s and 60s.  ""Christine"" had character and a pure evil disposition.We always like that famous pride of Kentucky, Harry Dean Stanton.  Harry Dean Stanton plays the police detective Rudolph Jenkins investigating the mysterious deaths caused by ""Christine.""  His cool demeanor shows that he actually believes that Christine is evil incarnate.  He takes the explanation of ""Christine"" as a matter of fact.  Stanton, now 76 years old, was 57 years old when ""Christine"" was filmed.  A veteran of many movies and television episodes, Stanton played the US Army recruiting sergeant who enlisted Goldie Hawn as ""Private Benjamin"" into the Army with the condos and country-club style living.  Remember, never believe all that your recruiting sergeant tells you.  Especially if he's Harry Dean Stanton and played along side of Paul Newman in ""Cool Hand Luke.""  In the immortal words of Strother Martin, ""What we have here ~ is failure to communicate.""
At the garage, Robert Prosky at 53 years of age, plays a rough, gruff foul-mouthed garage owner with a heart of gold who permits Arnie to store and restore his beloved ""Christine"" in a garage stall in exchange for after school labor.  Today, Mr. Prosky is 72 years old and still performing.
Oh!  Did I mention that Arnie's parents do not understand him?  A given in all teen movie plots.  His parents only serve to take his abuse at the dinner table.  Of course, Arnie gets tough and makes his stepfather into a wimp.  OK... OK... ""Christine"" made him do it!  All teens love their parents ~ right?This film is a classic.  If not for the 1958 Plymouth Fury Sports Coupe then for John Carpenter and Keith Gordon.  But, without Alexandra Paul we would only have 3/4ths of a movie.  See it ~ believe it!",Christine
166,The Terminator,An Excellent Horror Movie,7,3 June 2000,"This movie is great - although the novel outsmarts it by miles, John Carpenter's immitation was nothing short of a success. The 50's songs used were fantastic yet the actual score for the film was somewhat different, well, bad actually. Anyway, it is a cool movie and has an awesome final fight scene between, shall we say, Satan and the human race. Definately worth owning on video, I give it 7 out of 10.",Christine
167,ElmStreetsLastBrat,One of my favorites,6,11 February 2007,"John Carpenter's ""Christine"" from 1983 isn't great, but it's one of my favorites. I wouldn't necessarily consider this a horror film, but there are some scenes that will send chills up your spine. Keith Gordon plays Arnie Cunningham, a complete booksmart nerd who is constantly picked on by all the jocks in school and by his parents who try to make him into what they want him to be. Once he comes across a brokedown, rustbucket 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine, he has to buy her and fix her up. Once he does, he becomes cool, he gets the popular girl, and totally transforms his look. But what he doesn't know is that Christine has been possessed by the spirits of her dead previous owners. And once she has Arnie under her spell, she sets out to destroy anyone who picks on or does harm to her and Arnie. I thought this was an interesting storyline and the car is beautiful once Arnie has her all fixed up. One of my favorite scenes is where Arnie says ""show me"" and she fixes herself up in front of him after the bullies completely destroyed her. That's one of the coolest scenes in the film. There's also another scene where she's going down the highway at night and she's on fire after a gas station explosion. That was almost too wicked but it's cool. Some of the characters could have been developed more, such as Arnie's parents and maybe more of his background could have been told but the main focus is the car and that is what you get. This is a fun film to watch, especially for those of you who are looking for a cheap, non-scary thrill. ""Christine"" is not the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel, but it's definitely better than most. This is one of my favorite films and I enjoy it immensely. It won't go down in history as a ""great"" film but it's definitely fun. Especially for a car lover! Thank you for reading my review.",Christine
168,Psycho Mantis,Lots of athmosphere in this one,6,29 December 2001,"Nerdy high-school kid Arnie gets bullied all the time at school. He finds comfort in a ´58 Plymouth, a red beauty called Christine. She´s rather dusty when he discovers her, but he buys her and fixes her up. His friend Dennis discovers that he is becoming obsessed with the car, and he also suspects that Christine might have a life of her own. Horror-writer Stephen King teams up with horror-director John Carpenter, but the result feels that it could have been even better. But this is not bad, ""Christine"" mixes high-school life with horror elements in a nice sort of way. The scenes with Christine has lots of athmosphere, much thanks to the creepy music composed by John Carpenter himself.The lead trio (Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul) works well, but these days no one has ever heard of them. Solid actors like Harry Dean Stanton and Robert Prosky supports them.A nice and interesting horror-movie, which doesn´t really offers any scares.

169,Chris_Ego,It was the age when technological novelties were said to have a soul...,10,12 September 2021,"""Christine"" is a production of famous horror director John Carpenter who adapted Stephen King's book for this film. The red Plymouth Fury is an iconic image in the heads of horror film fans to date.This movie was released in 1983 and it was the age when technological novelties were said to have a soul. Just like Kubrik's ""2001"" and ""Number 5 Lives!"" there was always a fascination about technology with an AI and hundreds of films from the 80's to the 2000's deal with that idea. John Carpenter takes us on a wild ride with a ridiculous car that could be the evil sister of K. I. T. T.It was fun to watch ""Christine"" almost 40 years after its initial release! The acting of the young cast is typically naive but credible if you grew up with films like this. Many shots prove to come from the master of horror and the score is compiled with sure instinct. Many artists of the RnR songs have died ridiculous deaths and therefor appear on the soundtrack with authenticity. Nowadays it is not a horror film that scares the sh*t out of you, but it still is gory, fun and entertaining. Watch it for these purposes.",Christine

171,Roman11,Superb phantasy for it's genre!,10,17 September 2002,"Sure it's hokum and make believe but extremely well done. The plot is about a 1958 Plymouthbut that's not all by a long shot.  Keith Gordon is marvelous in the role of Arnie Cunningham making the transition from a spectacled nerd to a,weird,handsome,possessed maniac. The friend played by John Stockwell,the girlfriend played the beautiful Alexandra Paul are very real and convincing in their protrayls. Not to be omitted are the three villians of the high school They are menacing. Robert Prosky's crude, rude and profane junk yard owner is a standout.I find no fault in the film. Even though I didn't mention all the cast members they deserve kudos. I'ts fascinating and really holds. Great entertainment!",Christine
172,TruPretender,"Beyond desire, is something WAY out of control!",8,13 February 2006,"In some genres, a certain combination will bring out a pretty good story. In this case, Author Stephen King gave us the equation, as well as the solution. The book ""Christine"" is a horrifying story about the psychotic bond between a school geek, and his demonic car. You have a story about a shiny car that was born bad. It's bad enough as is, but it also goes deeper than just a maniacal machine. This car can love, just as well as it can kill. It has a burning desire for the affection it can receive only by the loneliest of men, with nothing else to live for. It is all very depressing, I will explain.Putting aside the opening sequence, we have two friends, full of life. One being Arnie, a stereotypical geek with virtually nothing going for him, the other being Dennis, a literal all-American apple-cheek football jock, the kind of guy to help his fellow man out. We find a nice bond with them. Perhaps they grew up together, or maybe their parents were friends. Whatever the case, it's a friendship worth having. Enter Christine, a blood-red Plymouth fury with an eerie past, and a mysterious gravitation field, effective on the most uncommon of men. Arnie is instantly seduced by this man killer of a machine, and once the final connection is made, there is no turning back. Arnie's behavior begins turning and changing in reflection of this unholy presence that destroys its enemies. A once respectful 17 year-old begins to display the most unbecoming of behavior towards his parents, the public authority, and soon, his friend, Dennis. He also reacts violently against the new girl in town, Leigh, who only wants to help.This film never grows old in it's distinct style and outrageous effects. Acclaimed director John Carpenter of ""Halloween"" fame brings to the screen, a stylish, eerie, chilling adaptation that also bears within itself a depressing element of a desire that kills. We have Arnie, who desires Christine, who in turn, yearns for his absolute devotion. Human hearts don't work like such, unless it is Christine they desire. The concept also asks the question, what do you want, and what are you willing to give for it? Soon enough, the character Arnie is isolated in his own desire, that grows with both rage and passion every time someone or something interferes with he and his car. Christine is a deadly temptation, as Arnie is the weak desire. Unnatural love takes it's course, while reality, in the form of Dennis and Leigh, goes on. Only so much can occur before evil vengeance is unleashed in a rage beyond control. What puts the depressing part in motion, is the need of the two martyrs to help, but trying to stop Christine is like teaching a bowl of rocks to fly.Keith Gordon certainly gave us his best as the ill-fated Arnie, which was a long way from almost becoming shark-food in ""Jaws 2"". We see him transform throughout the entire film, from honest decency, to morbid, selfishness, and the unnatural moments of intimacy with he and the car, are too creepy for words to say. John Stockwell gives the biblical impression of a modern day prophet, in Dennis, a teen who plays life by the rules, not only because he is smart, but because he cares. He has a real heart for friends, and the moral law of nature. Bravo! Alexandra Paul is also good as Leigh. Naive and gentile, but also very smart, and pro-active. Harry Dean Stanton turns in a fine performance, as does the rest of the cast.John Carpenter was riding the waves of success as his legacy was continuing from ""The Fog"". He put together a score to suit the film, and a great rock'n'roll soundtrack to fit the conceit of death with tunes of life. All around creepy, and never a dull moment. ""Christine"" will serve you with chills and thrills to the final cut.",Christine
173,chimera3,Be Afraid of Muscle Cars,9,8 September 2017,"To this day, I both love and fear muscle cars because of the way that they were built. I guess my love and fear for them started after I first read this book (I was about 9 or 10) and then watched the movie. Whenever I see someone selling a muscle car (and that is usually a rare occurrence), I smile and then just walk away. You may never know the history behind those cars. As I said, they are meant to be revered and to be feared because while they are truly beautiful to look at, they are also dangerous to be near because they don't have seat belts and you would definitely be in a world of hurt if you ever got into an accident. They are also made of solid steel, not like fiberglass with today's cars.If a car like ""Christine"" were to be on the road today against our modern-day cars, it would be no contest. That is the beauty behind a good Stephen King story. You have to be very careful whom you encounter, whether it be an animate object (like a person or an animal) or an inanimate object (like a car or laundry machine). Without giving anything away, it is just that simple. When you have someone like King team up with John Carpenter for one of these stories, you have to really watch your step. Like with so many others, this one will definitely have you watch your back when you walk down the street and see a red muscle car that looks like Christine.",Christine
174,darill-28027,"Truly enjoyed this movie, however...",8,3 January 2018,"I truly enjoyed this movie when I first went to see it at the theater. Of course I was a kid then. However, I have always look forward for part 2 to come out but that never happened. I was disappointed by that because the movie had misled me to thinking there would be a 2nd part of it. I would love to see a reboot of this movie so then they can continue on to make part 2 of it. I can understand it would have to be a different car since the car is very old now. But that's no problem. A reboot would be awesome!",Christine
175,S_dot_M_dot,Classic,8,9 October 2021,"A red Plymouth Fury comes off the assembly line leaving a path of destruction in 1958 Detroit. Fast forward to present day where nerdy Arnie (Keith Gordon) and his jock pal Dennis (John Stockwell) stumble upon the now beat up car. Arnie decides to bring the car back to life and reawakens the evil inside. Now Arnie is developing a mean streak and obsessives over his new wheels.A horror film about a possessed car based off the novel written by Stephen King, may sound difficult to translate to the big screen. Leave it to horror maestro John Carpenter to deliver a classic. The pacing and direction of this film keep you engaged and hanging on every frame. Carpenter's score bring an eerie element to the film that stands next to his most recognizable efforts.All of the acting in this drive the plot to the finish line. The slow decent of Arnie's obsessive behavior is the true horror of this film. Even the smaller roles serve as an excellent addition. When the cast buys in to a bizarre story, it makes the overall product more enjoyable.The faults here are few and far between. Having a killer car that acts on its own is a massive hurdle to overcome. There are a few times scenes drag and some over the top scenarios which is expected in a film like this.Christine is a testament that good direction and a solid cast can make any concept work. From the creative effects of a car regenerating to a driving soundtrack, this is how you tell a tale.",Christine

The bodycount was not very high and there wasn't much blood, But it can be scary without so much gore.  The only thing needed now is a sequel.

See him in ""All That Jazz"", ""Home Movies"", ""The Legend of Billie Jean"", and especially ""Static"" to get some idea of his range.

181,paris_whitney_hilton_nyc,Christine is a Lover not a Serial Killer,8,1 November 2014,"I have read the book and seen the movie several times . There is a world of difference between the two . In the movie version we see Christine more as a victim than a murderer . So what does Christine really want ? Well, mostly Arnie Cunningham's unconditional love which unfortunately turns into jealously and possession . Christine also desires to be respected much like a lady would want to be treated . She does not want to be touched inappropriately . She does not want cigar smoke and ashes dumped in her lap . She does not enjoy being slapped or called names . But most of all, she does not want anything to come between her and Arnie . Christine will protect her lover from harm and take her vengeance out on those who bully Arnie or attack her . Poor nerdy Arnie Cunningham, never gets any respect from anyone until he meets up with Christine . He never had a date and is bullied by everyone including his mom . When we first meet 20 year old Christine she is nothing more than a pathetically battered up old wreck of a car . She is waiting for her prince charming to come along and revive the life that still lives in her . And of course that's exactly what happens after Arnie spots her while on his way home from school after a very bad first day . Christine is driven back to Arnie's house but not allowed to park in the driveway . His domineering mother does not want that old piece of junk anywhere near her nice neat home . So it's off to Darnell's garage which will become Christine's new home where her total restoration will take place . Once Christine becomes brand new again is the beginning of what I would call a most bizarre love triangle . She does not want to be second best . If necessary she will use her powers to eliminate the competition . Christine is also a victim too . One night Arnie's tormentor's sneak into Darnell's garage and nearly pound her into rumble with sledgehammers . She is torn to pieces inside and out . This scene suggests Christine has just been brutally gang raped, mutilated, and beaten within an inch of her life . So do we have any compassion for her assailants when it's payback time ? Certainly not, as we want revenge too ! Unfortunately, there are only three scenes where Christine does her thing . I would have preferred a higher body count as was in the book . During the grand finale, Arnie's best friend Dennis and ex girlfriend Leigh challenge Christine to a duel to the death . Only this time Dennis brings a bulldozer with him which makes the climax a bit predictable .There is a touching scene after Arnie is mortally wounded and dies in Leigh's arms . Christine dims her lights and turns her motor off for a brief moment of silence to show her sadness for her now deceased lover, Arnie . But the fight is not over yet . Christine desperately tries to kill Leigh in the garage but is unsuccessful . The inevitable does happen as Christine is crushed and flattened by Dennis's superior bulldozer . After her death Christine winds up in the junkyard the next day and is compressed into block of scrape metal . I would have liked to have seen some extra scenes added about the relationship between Arnie and Christine . The newest DVD version includes some of the deleted scenes that were missing in the original movie .This movie could have been a lot better if the main characters where better developed . In the end, Christine is little more than a standard revenge movie with the novelty of a killer classic car instead of a maniac wielding an ax . Christine is neither Jason, nor Freddy Kruger , nor Michael Myers . She won't give you nightmares either . I would love to see either a sequel or better yet, a prequel to Christine . Christine, the love obsessed killer Plymouth born in hell and manufactured in Detroit . Love her or hate her, but I think she's one helluva Red Hot Beauty who continues to look better and better with age ! ..........PWH",Christine
182,petekrug17,More mechanical mayhem from Stephen King,10,19 April 2005,"This story bears some similar themes to another Stephen King film, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (which, by the way, was based on one of his earlier short stories, TRUCKS, and which was remade more than twenty years later as a film by the same name as the original short story.) The main difference between MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE and TRUCKS (both the short story and the 1997 remake) with the book and film CHRISTEN is that, in the stories about the trucks, lots of different machines came to murderous life, but otherwise stayed the same as they were before, meaning you could still destroy them just as easily. Blow a truck up, it stays blown up. Not so here. There's only one living automobile in this story, but it/she's virtually indestructible.There's really not much I can say about the plot that hasn't been said already. I will say that, in all the dozens of films in which I've heard the song,""Bad To The Bone"", here seems to be the best place to have it. While the songs in other films seems to refer to a hero who isn't afraid to get rough when he has to (TERMINATOR 2), or a kid with a mean-streak (PROBLEM CHILD 1&2, the PARENT TRAP remake), the song in this film refers to Christen, who really IS bad, and will kill anyone who gets in her way, without second thought. The song is played at the beginning and during the end credits, and the opening scene in the film is one of the coolest I've ever seen in a movie.Lastly, I know this will never, ever happen, but here's a crossover that I always thought would be a funny idea: Christen Vs. Herbie, the Love Bug.",Christine

187,calyeager,King and Carpenter sitting in a tree...,8,29 March 2021,"Let me be the first to acknowledge my bias and say that Stephen King's works to me are hugely influential. I also should mention that John Carpenter has given me some of my favorite movies, so my expectation was that Christine would be a huge slam dunk... and it was! Sure, it's campy, but the gorgeous red Plymouth Fury won me over (and I'm not even a car guy!). Keith Gordon's portrayal of Arnie Cunningham was hugely nuanced and powerful, even if it often bordered on soap-opera levels of cruelty. Harry Dean Stanton has a small but strong role as Detective Rudolph Junkins, a man who seems to have a good handle of what's really going on. The visual effects for the car's self-repair were shockingly clean and strong. The length of the film is exactly what I'd want from it; not too close to two hours. I'd give Christine an 8/10.",Christine
188,mafster,Remarkably brilliant,9,24 July 2005,"Again, when translation from book to film very rarely works it's hard to watch films after reading a great piece of work. Christine is no exception. Reading the book was a fantastic piece of writing but surprised that I was, the cut down size to viewing format actually worked.Cuts were made of course but that really didn't effect the film and the point of the film. The love triangle elements between Christine, Leigh and Arnie still strongly exists and you actually feel for the car especially towards the end. The soundtrack to the film is wonderfully selected and executed especially the part where Moochie gets killed. The car sits casually while playing a really cool track with fingers clicking. Then burst to life with fury. It gave the car real character. The actors were also chosen well which made the viewing more comfortable.John Carpenter I think hit home here. To make a car feel like it has real feeling without making it into a spirited monster is surely an achievement.To the book, this film is still a watered down version but a proud film it stands along a collection of horror films. I love it.",Christine
189,MsHoneyBee,"No, just no.",4,27 April 2020,"Maybe all the people who reviewed this movie never read the book. Maybe also they were being nice because it's John Carpenter. I'm not sure what went on but this is not a good movie.I'll start with that was good: acting on the part of male characters, the car rebuilding itself and the set on fire scene. That is all.Now the bad, from the perspective of someone who has only seen the movie. Leigh's character was as useful as a bag of bricks and although it was acted well, there isn't much to be done with such a vacuous role. The setting meant nothing for the whole film. Darnell's garage was cool, thank goodness but everyone's house, the school and whatnot was a shell of every other teen movie of its time. The Timeline was a joke. Why offer a time line if everything is going to literally feel like it happened weeks apart. Characters appearance didn't seem to change, even Arnie who was supposed to be severely different only looks a week older... Arnie's interactions with his parents are incredibly off beat. His dad was roughing him up on the stairs just to let Arnie ""choke"" him ever so slightly then he backs down? They did nothing to show the strength or force that Arnie possessed was enough to scare his father... last, the actors are too old for these roles. I found Arnie and Dennis believable as teens, but everyone else was clearly too old.Now, bad from the perspective of someone who read the book... the screenplay writer took out EVERYTHING that meant ANYTHING to the book. Why in gods name did they take out Roland LeBay?? He is the reason Christine is even after Arnie the way he is. Although I assume Christine was already ghostly, (LeBay may have sacrificed his dead child to the car which gave he and the car a greater connection... and Christine is the one who killed the kid, just like she tried to kill Leigh). Roland LeBay IS EVERYTHING. Christine is not a whole lot and that's okay. The film would have been just fine if Christine wasn't the star because guess what, even in the book, with LeBay as the puppet master, she was the star. ghosts are like cool, that's scary, but a big bodied all metal car coming at you, that's scary.Next, Arnie's change was slower than this in the book. In the film, the sloppy and almost unnoticed time lapses failed to make Arnie's change seem gradual. He went from 0 to 100. The film didn't even do the most basic element from the book that would indicate these changes - makeup. This character went from pimples to smooth skin, from a teen to seeming more adult and then eventually looking as old as the man who'd possessed him. This could EASILY be accomplished with makeup. Instead, Arnie and all the other characters look just a week older every time we see them.I'll end my rant with the deaths. In the book the deaths were indeed elaborate and challenging for a film. Christine kills Darnell by driving into his house. Hard but not impossible for a film... I understand them changing a little bit but I have to tell you that EVERY SINGLE DEATH was different. NOT ONE DEATH FROM THE BOOK WAS IN THE MOVIE. The only one remotely close was the first when the guy got run over but in the book this kid was turned to mush. Christine ran him over 3-4 times. In the film he was merely cut in half. And someone tell me why they didn't include some gore??? They were going for an R rating but decided that no blood would be used??? They just added bad words to get the R rating? There were a lot of bad words in the book, they got that part right, but the murder scenes from the book could have easily gotten them that R rating and yes some needed to be changed a bit but they didn't have to be completely changed or omitted.All and all, I could only recommend this movie to people who hadn't read the book and even then... I just don't know. I was disappointed.",Christine
190,rickdumesnil,absolutely stunned,8,30 October 2012,For sure i thought i would hate this movie but decided to watch it on a late show last night...what the heck ill zap if its boring. Low and behold from the very beginning i was entranced. The story is fun.....the music is good...the actors are excellent....its scary...funny...sad. I just loved it and what a genial ending...the man walking with his radio behind the wreck.Alexandra was a true beauty and in that movie she had the whole package deal.....John Stockwell why isn't he around anymore....now that was a sexy lad...not artificial like some actors of the day. And the actor who played the nerd....felt so dam sorry for him and his facial expressions were so real...i still cringe. Yes a good movie that i should have watched when it came out. OHand lets not forget CHRISTINE wow what a sexy lovely thing.,Christine
191,pwmoses,Great film with definition cool attitude,10,28 May 2000,"This film is one of the coolest horror/thriller films ever made, right up there with ""Fright Night"". The whole film feels like it takes place on one strange weekend. John Stockwell (""Dennis"" in the film)is excellent as the main character's best friend. There is a great scene where he sticks up for his nerd buddy in the high school shop class. The transition that ""Arnie"" goes through from nerd to tough guy is very well done, and well acted by Keith Gordon. John Carpenter was a great director in this period of the eighties. His later work like ""Escape from L.A."" should be forgotten, and classics like ""Christine"", ""Halloween"", ""The Fog"", and ""Escape From New York"" should be put on a pedestal.",Christine

Half of the movie was nothing but cheesy pointless dialogue between teenagers one of them worshiping his car. All of the wasted build up and not one care in the world about these characters. It was just a complete waste of time and then when we finally get the car scenes they're just cheesy lack luster. And I get it was made In a time when they couldn't make great effects. Yes I know I live in A privileged time, but I know a quick cash grab when I see one. The climax was so underwhelming I feel like I can grab my dad's old camera from the 80s and film a better climax. I literally can find an old beat up car from the 80s that doesn't even run have two of my friends push the car from the back to make it look like it moves and it would be better than this movie! Even for its time this was a waste. I feel like the director had no idea what they wanted to do with this movie. Please do not waste your time seeing this movie.

When I read the book I was surprise it was so different. But I didn't have a problem with that, it was a very good adaptation with one of John Carpenter's trade marks Great special effects. I know how they had christine put herself back together, but it's still amazing for the 80's, even by today standards(Because it would be all CGI and look terrible).I am also surprise that not many horror fans (at least around this area) don't talk about this movie or like it. This is one of carpenter's best, it's up there with ""The Thing"", ""halloween"", or ""Escape from New York"". There arn't too many bad Carpenter movies.Stephen King has a lot of good stories that are just messed up when they are made into films, but not Christine. King should just let Carpenter or George A. Romero, do all his movies from now on.P.S. The world will be a sad place once John Carpenter leaves us.",Christine

Since the book has 'Christine' driving up someones stairs to get them, and also the death of the thugs that trashed her were better in the book. And the death of Arine and his parents ( In the book much, much better...) Try it again, you guys... Even though I stopped reading or buying any Stephen King book, because he is a racist, I still loved the early books. My favorite, was 'The Stand' , but I stopped buying them after I realized that every single time he described an African American, they always had to be discribed as 'Ni**ers' I wish there were a way to get all of my money back.

196,Sooner_88,John Carpenter's most underrated classic!,8,12 May 2017,"I admit, I'm a John Carpenter fan. Always have, and always will enjoy his work and choices of projects(I taken an inspiration from him). This is no different. It's an 80's tent pole of that era. Throwback to the 50's, spice it up to 80's music, and you have a classic film.The actors themselves do a fine job and are very likable. Especially, the flawed and gullible Arnie Cunningham. And of course, you can't forget the amazing classic that is the 1958 Plymouth. What a beauty of a car(a dream car of mine even though I was born in 88'). Destroyed 18 times making me appreciate this movie even more for the fact that practical effects(another reason I love Carpenter's work) can never be forgotten. Sad, that among Stephen Kings adaptations that this is criminally overlooked, but only by the majority. And I'm happy to hear that this has cult following, that I'll happily join anyday. 8/10",Christine
197,sati_84,"Wake up, it's not the same story!",2,18 May 2006,"Christine is my all time favorite book. When I tried to watch this movie for the first time on TV, I gave up after the first five minutes. I hated the way the movie handled the relationship of the two main characters. Their dialogue exchange in the car in their first scene... It was a real disgrace. I got so angry, I actually ran away from the TV and I didn't want to see how the rest of the story was handled by the director.That was about 4 years ago. Now, I calmed down to a level, I could watch the entire movie. And I'm angry again. But now I can handle it...The whole movie is just a vague shadow of the story of the book. The character's names are similar, some similarities in their story here and there, but nothing serious.1. Dennis and Arnie are reduced to two testosterone-driven jerks. WTF? In the book their relationship is so detailed, you can breath the same air they're breathing. When I read the book I was there. I was freakin' there! In the seventies! In the book, Dennis never saying anything like he says in his first scene. I won't even quote that line, it's not worth it. The entire conversation is pointless and goes nowhere. Their relationship in the movie is just lame. It doesn't justify anything that happens, and when Arnie dies, you can't feel sorry for him. You never knew him, why should you care? Why should Dennis care? Why should anybody care? In the book, the outcome of the events carried such impact, I've never read in any book ever. It's a brilliant masterpiece. In the movie there are ruins of a decent killing car horror flick. The book is not a killing car horror flick. No, it's not. The book is about growing up and having issues with yourself. None of this could make it into the movie. I would be ashamed if I filmed such a piece of garbage from this book.2. The origin of the ""spirit"" in Christine. In the book everything makes perfect sense, in the movie even the simplest thing is illogical. Who bought the car originally? We meet a guy called LeBay, who had a brother, who bought the car which turned out to be a killer car, killed everybody, including the poor guy, and what does his brother do? He sells the car! Let's endanger some other people! In the book, the guy who sells it, bought it, and it's his spirit which made the car an instrument of killing, and when he is about to die, he sells the car, so his spirit can live on in it. This is basically it, but in the book it's so much more detailed, and it's simply brilliant all the way.3. The characters doing nothing in the movie. Buddy Repperton is a villain, that's about the only OK point of the movie. Dennis isn't aware of anything, he just lays in the bed in the hospital, hardly sees Christine, hardly hears anything about ""her"", and despite all of this, he knows everything about ""her"", makes contact with Leigh, and they plan to kill ""her"". But it doesn't make any freakin' sense! It's totally ridiculous: Dennis never saw anything remotely suspicious about the car, he doesn't have a reason to believe it can run by itself, etc. He just says: ""Ok, let's waste it!"". Ludicrous! 4. There are so much more distasteful changes, and blindingly obvious plot holes in the movie, that I don't even want to go into them. There is no 4th point.Here's what I'll do: I'll forget this movie entirely, and when I'll read the book for like the 20th time this summer, I won't remember it.This movie shouldn't have been made.2/10, because it's at times watchable. By no means decent, but watchable.",Christine
198,corbett,An edit would have fixed it.,5,27 October 2002,"'Christine'  is a pretty stylish, compelling film.

This is just like those other movies, and the formula's pretty tiresome. However, it did have a fairly solid cast, and some pretty funny scenes (e.g. the flaming car, and the car when it's smashed down); yet I'm not sure how funny they were supposed to be.

The energy and rebellion of 50's rock n roll is captured well in this film , to a lot of metal kids of today ,they might hear the song ""bonnie maronie "" and say ""what awful music "" this film gives that song real justice and a good insight into how these rock'n'rollers were the ""slipknot "" of their time "" ! Stephen king's horror is timeless as it tap's into cultural icons ,be it a nokia mobile phone ,a cigarette or a 50's Chrysler car. match this with the suspense mastery and visual audio chic of john carpenter and its hard to see how you could go wrong . one kill in particular is visually spectacular this is matched with some of john carpenter's own music , which provides another cool mix of cultures suddenly we are in late 70's early 80's synth driven Gothic funk ! this scene would make a great video for so many bands (cmon you you-tubers ! ) the moral code is clear in this film and the car acts its evil often in form of jealously,vengeance . where as in Halloween we get through the mask camera shots , in Christine we get behind the wheel ones , but the pace is quicker , Michael myers is a stalker sneaky , where as Christine is a good time rock chick ! anyway i hope you enjoy this film . and if you do check out cat's eye .",Christine

I must admit to a bit of bias, since I owned a great many of the awesome MoPar (Chrysler Corp) street-stompers, like this '58 Fury, and I have a great understanding -- nay, sympathy -- for Arnie's obsession with this spectacular breed of car. My twin-carbed Chrysler 300s and Plymouths also evoked a visceral, almost sexual power when you lit 'em up and the tailpipes roared....with the twin four-barrel carbs and 150-mph speedometer, this breed of rumbling metal vampire was as close as Detroit ever got to building a sex goddess. I've just watched CHRISTINE for the umpteenth time, and still cringed whenever she got smashed. I only hope they did most of this with models or tricked-up Belvederes, not Furys...If you've overlooked this gem because it sounds schlocky or just because it's Steven King's -- go rent it. Make some popcorn, turn down the lights and get ready for a Hell of a ride....literally.",Christine
204,thoughtfox,"Testosterone, Possession, and Freud",7,26 October 2006,"Carpenter's film about a classic muscle car lends itself to notions of the size of a young man's ego, equaled by the size and value of the car he owns. Although this story has been done before, John Carpenter's tale takes on a new twist that challenges the old song and dance of: the bigger my car, the bigger my genitalia, and the longer the list of women made available to me. Christine is a movie adapted from Stephen King's novel of the same name. King has a way of discovering the innermost vulnerabilities of the human psyche, and then splashing them in public for everyone, including the popular kids, to see and revile in; this is the strong point of Carpenter's movie, Christine.The film takes a young, odd, effeminate high schooler, one who is domineered by a harpy of a mother, and becomes empowered via the mechanical, sexual prowess of a classic muscle car of the 50s. This power equation is soon tipped in favor of the inanimate object, a fetish, if you will, of the muscle car, and young Arnie Cunnigham finds himself at the mercy of Christine. Once Christine realizes she has him in her grasp, a ploy she has had all along, since her power comes alive when an insecure young chap like Arnie comes around, Christine turns on her newfound ""lover,"" and evolves into the quintessential bitch. Christine replaces Arnie's mother as the domineering female figure in his life, but instead of being satisfied by simply dominating him, Christine completely takes over Arnie'a life, and eventually, she is the cause of his total demise.Although I disagree with the way women are projected in this film (as harpies, bitches, and control freaks), I can appreciate what Carpenter is doing in regard to a young, insecure, outsider high-schooler, and the need for validation in such a crazy world. The credence that Arnie finally discovers in order to make his existence valid, happens to be a car named Christine, and that's as far as gender should be taken into account...arterial, it is just fiction.",Christine
205,carlsbadrn,Glen or Glenda?,8,30 June 2006,"OK, so you're asking yourself why am I talking about an Ed Wood movie like Glen or Glenda? in association with a movie like Christine? What's that got to do with it? Well, everything. Stephen King is a master of subtle commentary and with one word he sums up this entire book: Christine. Did anyone stop and wonder why he called the car Christine? I did. Why not Peggy Sue or Mary Lou or some other sappy name from the 1950s? Well, it was obvious. To me at least. Maybe I'm way off base. No one can actually know what's going on in his mind, nor would we want to I suspect. But Steve and I are the same age, we were both old enough in the 50s to appreciate the fantastic cars that were produced during the latter part of that decade as well as the world wide scandal that rocked moral minded people everywhere. Maybe we didn't understand it, but the news was rammed down our throats day and night by the media and we knew something was not quite right here. Christine Jorgenson had become a woman thanks to a sex change operation. What? How could this be? This man went beyond ""God's laws"" and changed his sex. So Ed Wood, bless him, conned his way into directing Glen or Glenda? which was supposed to cover this story, but instead he used it as a showcase for himself, to tell people he liked to wear woman's under panties and dress in pink sweaters. He often directed his films wearing a wig and dress but in now way tried to be a woman. He was just eccentric and loved woman's clothes. So what's the connection between that and Christine Jorgenson? Simple: change. The timing was perfect. The assembly line at the Chrysler plant producing the 1958 Plymouth Fury, one of the sharpest cars ever to leave Detroit and one of my personal favorites. The 50s were a time or change and unrest. The cold war, sexual freedom, the bomb, beatniks, outlandish cars - such as the '59 Caddy with tail find 10"" lower than the roof! Why name a car Christine? Simple answer again: change. The possessed car could change right in front of our eyes, repair itself, renew itself, and each time the miles on the speedometer would go backwards. From 99,000 miles it suddenly reached 88,000 miles. This was a car lover's dream come true! Well, I won't give away any plot details and it's far different from the book. Like there's no dead guy in the back seat speaking to the new owner. They saved that for Pet Semetery. But if you like classic cars this is the film for you! The Fury also destroys a Camaro which I was also fond of. After seeing the movie I asked myself, wouldn't this be a great car to own? It goes out by itself, gets rid of people you don't like, returns home and repairs itself! An insurance man's dream for sure. No costly repair bills to pay out. Great movie, watching the transformation of the wrecked car and it's nerdy owner is worth the price. At the end I don't know if I felt more sorry for Arnie or the car.",Christine

Keith Gordons performance is amazing. It deserved a nomination. The acting all around is great. The effects are absolutely perfect. CGI would not look this good. It deserved a nomination. The direction is spot on. Great cinematography.For an absurd premise Carpenter and cast really sell it.Christine feels like a person... beautiful... narcissistic... obsessive... insane... she is abused and assaulted...which only makes her more insane.

207,Shiloh-3,Highly underrated.,8,31 October 2001,"In my opinion, this film, like The Shining, is often compared to the novel it is based on and then quickly dismissed as not being good.  I think this is unfair, because I think it is a real task to bring hundreds of pages of written prose into less than 2 hours of master film making.  Christine has really made it in my mind.  It is a great fim based on a great book. The license taken by the director is not only warranted, but justified by the final result of this film.",Christine
208,bsempowski,The real horror is no seatbelts and drunk driving,4,28 October 2019,This movie is relatively high-quality adaptation of Stephen King novel. this movie is very sexist and demeaning to women. One of the only female characters is a literal object the car Christine. The movie is also filled with  shaming and an gross comments about women's appearances. The movie is also filled with unnecessary extremely demeaning profanity does targeted about women or is directed towards women. The movie is also not scary anyway a car driving itself is not all that terrifying. The scariest part of this movie is the graphic descriptions of the murders of people however nothing is shown. Many of the most interesting parts of the movies are not visually depicted which makes the movie very uninteresting. The best part of the movie is when Christine is driving on its own on fire it's like a crazy music video. The friendship and this movies also extremely interesting and there's a slight homosexual undercurrent that would be interesting to explore the future allocation. Overall this movie despite its faults is a fairly good October movie that's a good movie to watch if you just want something fun and exciting to watch on a rainy afternoon. I would not consider it a classic movie by this extremely interesting. The soundtrack is also full of great rock from the 80s. Many of the problematic aspects of this movie are results of when the film was released in the subject matter in which it was based on. the underlying undercurrent of this movie would also be interesting to explore from a feminist perspective.,Christine

212,cseat,Just Get Off Of The Street You Idiot!,6,12 February 2006,"First of all I am a John Carpenter fan. I think John Carpenter does a terrific job directing this picture, but let's be honest here, a murderous automobile isn't the best premise for a horror movie, and in my opinion the thought of being chased down by a renegade Ford Fiesta with a taste for blood doesn't exactly shoot terror pains throughout my body. Given this ridiculous concept though, Carpenter makes the best of it. As the movie progresses our main character Arnie goes through some major personality changes thanks to Christine The Love Car. This is charted nicely by Carpenter with the help of some overacting by Keith Gordon. The rest of the thirty something's portraying Arnie's high school friends do a decent acting job given the subject matter. Overall I think this is as good as car killer movies can get, which is saying a lot. Oh and by the way, if you ever find yourself being chased by a driverless demon car, don't run in the middle of the street, go where cars can't follow, like the other 95% of the planet that aren't streets.",Christine

However, like most people, you're often apprehensive when they decide to turn it into a movie...Don't be, with Christine! It's very well done and pretty much keeps to the storyline.The long and short of it, is Chrisitne is a possessed car that the nerdy kid falls in love with and restores. Thus begins the adventures as Christine begins to dish out revenge on everyone who has ever caused grief for her new owner- and you'd better watch out if you're on the crap list!!!!",Christine

215,PaulNewmanIsDead,A better Maximum Overdrive,8,24 June 2006,"As a fan of anything John Carpenter, I wasn't sure what to expect with this film. Would it be another fun horror flick like The Fog, or a great popcorn flick like Escape From New York or Assault On Precinct 13? Nope. Instead, we get an incredibly well told story with some good acting, and a relatively ridiculous story that is made believable through wonderful writing and impeccable direction. Much like Starman, Carpenter spends plenty of time developing the main characters, which separates this horror flick from others. We sympathize with the characters and get to know them, watching them go through changes and developing. It's made all the easier via a good cast that does a good job with the material. Carpenter also succeeds in turning a vehicle (Christine) into an entirely believable character. Much like ""the ring"" in Lord Of The Rings, Christine is an object that is lusted after and conquers its owner with greed. Carpenter does a great job creating a sense of dread as well which resonates whenever the bright red car is on screen. This is a very good horror film that is a little different, in the sense that it takes the time to establish it's main characters. John Carpenter does a fantastic job with this Stephen King story. The rating is taken down just a tad by a somewhat anti-climatic finale.",Christine
216,swinktorxer,Pretty Good,6,19 January 2008,"Being a huge Stephen King fan, I love his books and like the movie adaptations. Of course, none of them can really compare with the original works. Christine was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and still remains my favorite. The movie really did the book well. It didn't overdo the gore or anything. It was spooky, but also showed the deeper meaning of teenage obsession and the love story subplot. The acting was perfect. The only thing I didn't like was that there were a few main points that they left out that would have made the movie perfect. Other than that, I had no problem with it. Keith Gordon, I have to say, stole the show. He played an excellent Arnie, first being the wimpy nerd and then going to this complete bad ass greaser. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants a good film, but isn't expecting too much out of it.",Christine
217,DaveduFresne80,The editor should have been nominated for an Academy Award!,10,25 June 2021,"If you watch the deleted scenes on youtube (which I don't recommend) you can see a much weaker movie. The movie that we actually saw though was great. It really isn't horror, it's more like black drama or mystery drama. Very few films are scary to me though, at best you have jump scares or things that want to make you throw up. Alzheimer's is scary, cancer is scary, a mystery car that kills people, not so scary.The film might score a bit higher if the Nerd's transition wasn't so sudden. We have a short, skinny kid who is bullied by his parents and presumably everyone at the school. He buys a 50s car (you have to remember this is set in the 70s when they were still garbage rather than classics) and fixes it up. Suddenly he turns from a guy who can barely talk to a confident, alpha type who manages to ask the prettiest girl in the school out. How he screws that up is so realistic too.The actor doesn't take any steroids, doesn't do anything except stop wearing his glasses and acts in a different manner, but as a viewer we totally buy into the transformation. Could he take on the school bully in a fistfight after transforming? Maybe not, but no way does the bully bother this version of Arnold. As teenagers are want to change, it is at first unclear what is going on. Is a little manual labor and finally standing up to his parents responsible for the change, or is there a little more to it?Arnold's friend, the jock, isn't the greatest actor in the world, but considering he's playing a high school kid who is probably considered cool for his athleticism and looks but is still a little uncertain and shy in reality does just fine. Arnold's girlfriend is the same, and I would say she has even less screen time. All the other supporting actors are great. The overbearing mom, the cranky garage owner, the mysterious car seller, the detective that knows Arnold is guilty but can't pin the crime on him. I can't list their names off the top of my head, but they are all well known actors and really elevate the film.",Christine

219,Zom-Lassic,Zom Lassic's CHRISTINE review,10,1 November 2017,"Without a doubt, Christine has got to be, next to Halloween of course,one of John Carpenter's best films. A movie about a teen falling in love with his car named Christine, which happens to be possessed by an unknown evil entity, proves to be a true horror masterpiece. Keith Gordon plays that teen, in an extremely strong, creepy performance, that is very memorable. John Stockwell as Gordon's best friend, and Alexandra Paul as Gordon's girlfriend, who sparks an intense jealous steak in Christine, are also excellent. In fact, in my opinion, the entire cast gives pretty good performances. Carpenter's direction is pitch perfect, done with ease and style, and a film that must be seen in its letterbox format, so you can truly appreciate each and every brilliant widescreen shot, absolutely amazing cinematography, I especially love the image of a completely engulfed in flames Christine speeding right behind one of Gordon's enemies, just beautiful. Also, Carpenter's score once again proves to be a major factor to the success of one of his movies, it's one factor that made Halloween so memorable, and Christine is no exception, it's a great score, every bit of music fits every scene perfectly, including the song ""Bad To The Bone"". Christine is suspenseful, gripping, and exciting. Filled with characters that are true to life, in ways, you can relate to them, especially Gordon's Arnie character. It's also interesting to see Arnie's transformation, from regular teen to an insane, obsessed psychopath. Furthermore, the visual effects are absolutely outstanding, seeing broken Christine, put itself back together again, is an amazing sight to watch. The revenge plot line in the movie...teen with killer car versus school bullies, may seem predictable, but who cares, it's always fun to watch jerks get what they deserve. By the way, it's also refreshing to see a horror movie be very effective, without showing too much blood. So, nevertheless, Christine maybe one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel, but in my opinion, It's one of the best John Carpenter movies of all time. Highly recommended.",Christine
220,sunman909,Well worth a watch,9,5 November 2006,"If you are a horror fan like myself you will not want to miss at least one viewing of this film.On the other hand if you are not a fan but cars are your thing and you like to be scared once in awhile you may still enjoy this version of Stephen Kings novel,Keith Gordon is excellent and very believable as Arnie,obsessed with his Plymouth car,love the rock n roll soundtrack,which is a perfect compliment to the makeup of the movie.The book is one of my favourite King novels having spent many a late night reading it unable to put it down,Christine the movie has all the same elements to keep your eyes glued to the screen.Well worth a watch.",Christine
221,dockendorf1,Definitely original,5,9 January 2013,"From the Director that brought you ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing,"" comes another horror movie that has some legit scares. ""Christine"" is about a bullied boy who falls in love with a possessed and extremely jealous car. The guy who buys ""Christine,"" was always picked on, until he found one thing that was ""uglier"" than he was. He fixes up the car, and it gets him lots of friends and girls, but he neglects his parents, schoolwork, and eventually his best friend, because he finally learns what it's like to be popular. With a couple thrilling scenes, it doesn't live up to John Carpenter's two fore-mentioned films, but is still interesting to watch. It's definitely original.",Christine

223,vamptrampzombie,Killer Car.,10,4 November 2000,"This is a great adaption of a great book.  The book, however, was more of a ghost story, while the movie keeps the focus on the killer car.  I liked the movie alot.  Buddy Reperton is one of the greatest jerks in horror movie history.  He is a good bad guy, if he could be called that.  And the evolution of Arnie from nerd to semi-greaser is fun to watch.  Keith Gordon was also in the movie Back to School, and did a similar turn.  The oldies soundtrack was good, if you're in to that sort of thing.   A recomendation for any Stephen King, or John Carpenter fan.",Christine
224,lowecasper,Enjoyable horror romp,8,20 January 2021,I found this film to be thoroughly enjoyable indeed. I enjoyed it's no nonsense approach choosing to skip trying to explain the why and just getting on with the carnage. It was a hard watch in the beginning because everybody was soo unlikeable (I get that was the point) but it led to a very satisfying 2nd half where all the asshats got their just desserts. Don't get me wrong I certainly wasn't on Arnies side by the films conclusion. Carpenter again proved why he is a master of his craft and why he remains one of my top 3 horror masterminds ever.,Christine

I don't remember seeing the lead actor in anything other than this and as Rodney Dangerfield's son in Back to School but he's really great in this as Arnie. The mood and writing are great and if you like older, classic cars you'll freak for Christine. The type of ending is overdone now but at the time it was really killer, and the soundtrack is amazing too. Nothing I didn't like about this one.",Christine
227,kanzow,This one changed my life...,10,14 February 2000,"...when I was 18 in 1984. I saw the movie one afternoon, bought the book immediately after leaving the cinema and perused it during the next 24 hours (over 500 pages). I LOVED the book, and I LOVED the Plymouth, Christine. (In 1992, I found a real 58 Plymouth Fury at Cologne, Germany, and it was a great experience driving this beauty through the streets... thanks again, Edgar).The book was about teenagers at my age, how they feel and what they are dreaming of. This was my first Stephen King book and many of them would follow. But when you look at my bookshelf, you see the most worn out is the big red one. I even got the English original.The film omitted the things I did not like in the book. Who is the bad guy, is it the car, or is it LeBay? In the book, LeBay is haunting the car but can act without it, too, so it seems not logical to me why destroying the car should destroy LeBay.In the film, there's just a bad born car. It's a metaphor for ""how ownership can become possession"" and many teenagers have a very emotional relationship to their car, many kids are dreaming of a strong friend taking revenge to the bad guys at school. And every car owner wishes cars could repair themselves!The car is a symbol for the wrong thing to adore - it's a thing, it's a toy, and loving a car should always be a game, a hobby, no more. When Leigh appears, she becomes a symbol for the right way, she drives the teenager tofledge.The woman and the car are natural enemies - many men know that :-). But Arnie's addiction to the car is too strong - it has to be destroyed. (But: when the camera sweeps along the lines of the '58 Plymoth I understand Arnie perfectly, I mean, the '58 is very rare now, and a girl is just a girl, isn't it? :-)It's tragical that Arnie can only be divorced from Christine by death. And his friends, Leigh and Dennis, get to know that growing up means sometimes losing something.We don't really know how big the damage must be to prevent Christine from reviving. But I am glad that there were no cheap sequels, no ""Christine II"" - because that would have meant another dozen of slaugthered beauties - and I hope to buy one myself, some day.",Christine

229,darkspyro-02663,How do you kill something that can't possibly be alive? You can't! Christine is to awsome to die,10,10 April 2019,"Christine is horror movie that didn't do well at the box office, but is now a cult classic. The car Christine kills anyone who gets in her way. The opening scene is in a car factory in detroit 1957 and thats where Christine kills her first victim: a worker who is killed of screen. 21 years later we meet the nerd Arnie and guess what, he's bullied at school (of course). He buys an old car (who happens to be Christine) and he fixes her. Arnie is slowly driven mad by being around the demonic car. Four guys (i only remember three of them) end up on Christine's kill list after trying to wreck her for fun: first one is cut i half of screen in an alley way, second one dies in a gas station explosion and the third one in is runed over by a burning Christine. At the end of the movie Arnie is killed by a shard of glass after he falls out of Christine's windshield and Christine is soon crushed into a boxed shape and the movie ends with a piece of metal moving (hinting that Christine is putting herself back together).",Christine
230,benferriere,how could it be better?,9,8 January 2005,"Let's face it. Christine is far from the best novels of King, especially this creepy dead former owner, sitting on the backseats, and teasing Arnie.Carpenter chose not to put this character into the movie. What a great choice. Which other movie has shown a true love between a human and a machine ever since? I mean, a film with no ridiculous situations and tired old gags. None.Big John created a weird teenage movie, with a great cast (Keith Gordon has never been better) and a hypercool soundtrack. One of a kind you won't easily forget!",Christine
231,AZFiresky,"Not the book, but enjoyable",7,31 January 2007,"Being a fan of the book (and owning #58 of the 1000 signed limited editions), I was glad in hindsight that I saw the movie before I started reading the book. And while it is typical that movies often don't capture the spirit of the story in words or imagination, John Capenter's Christine refused to capture many elements that made the King's story a true ghost story. Instead the movie glossed over so much of what made the story frightening, the most notable being the possession of Arnie by both Christine and the deceased first owner, Roland LeBay. I only wish that the screenplay had stayed within that spirit and implemented other various elements mentioned in the book. Had that been the case I have no doubt that the film would've and could've easily joined the ranks of other ghost story classics such as Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. However when all was said and done, it came across more as ""wow, cool"" entertainment.That fact notwithstanding, this is still a memorable and fun film. It also had some very good performances especially by Keith Gordon, Robert Prosky and Christine Belford. Indeed where it missed on being an effective, evil ghost story it definitely made up for it in old fashioned popcorn entertainment. Seven and 1/2 stars",Christine
232,david_richards,Disgrace!!!!,2,21 April 2002,"Being an avid Stephen King fan and lover of the book Christine I was simply fuming watching this movie as it simply destroyed and changed many elements of the book that made it such a fantastic tale. As with the terrible IT and criminally inept The Stand it appears that producers and filmmakers seem to buy the rights to these stories just to get Stephen Kings name at the top of the title and then disregard the films main key points (eg. Stanley Kubricks movie The Shining made absolutely no sense at all). Many of SKs novels have been plundered and ripped apart, if youre going to adapt one of his novels or short stories at least have a decent crack at it. Besides Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, Carrie, Delores Claiborne and Misery there are really no other SK adaptations that not only dont live up to the books but are just terrible B-Grade trash as stand alone films. To finish off the recent Hearts In Atlantis was probably the worst of the lot and Im waiting with bated breath to discover how the upcoming Dolans Cadillac is going to be handled.",Christine
233,borisratnik,They butchered another Stephen King book . . .,6,18 October 2006,"Even though they hacked the book to pieces (like Hollywood always does,) the movie was still a lot of fun! I loved watching all of Arnie's dirt-bag enemies get it, one by one. And when Christine had Moochie Welch cornered in the alley and the butterball pulled a switchblade and sniffled and blubbered ""you're a dead man now!,"" I just fell out on the floor! I laughed so hard I almost pooped. I mean, here's this 3,600-lb. demon-possessed metal killing-machine, and he's making threats! Useless machismo at its finest.Anyway, they used (I think) six different cars in the movie to cover all the wrecks, and the regenerating car was made of plastic. Way cool special effects for the time. They still look great, even now.I have issue with one thing, though: near the end when Arnie wrecks Christine into that metal beam and he comes flying out through the windshield, what the heck were they thinking of by using flat ""candy-glass""? Car glass is either safety glass or laminated safety glass. (It was invented in 1928!) One other blooper: in one of the many scenes where they showed Christine's speedometer, one of them was scaled to 150 MPH. All the other shots showed a limit of 120. Oops. They slipped a shot of one of the police special cars in.There was a British fan who wrote in recently (Audril-4? Did I get that right?) who said that Roland Le Bay was a Vietnam veteran. Nope. In the book, he joined the Army in 1921 (I think) and got out in the 1950s as an old man. He was a veteran of World War II and of the Korean war, but not Vietnam.Still, I really liked it and it was fun! I have it on tape and I watch it every now and then.Boris Ratnik",Christine

I love this movie and I too think that it's neat how 'she' can fix herself. I think they should make a sequel even though Stephen king never wrote a second Christine book because at the end when she is crushed into a cube, she slowly starts to fix herself. Anyway, great movie, great car, great acting. For those of you who who enjoy motor vehicles and horror movies or horror movie involving vehicles like I do, this is the movie for you. Overall, this is one of john carpenter's greatest horror film's that he has ever made in his career.",Christine
237,dead_by_dawn-1,Thoughts On Christine,8,23 January 2007,"Christine the book and Christine the movie came out in theaters and in bookstores at around the same time in 1983 (if my memory serves me if was deliberately planned that way.) At the time, Stephen King was going through his drug daze, writing novel after novel in a coke and alcohol fueled haze. This goes far to explain the length of the books he wrote at this time, and it also goes far in explaining why the film adaptation of Christine is the rare instance where the movie is better then the book (although please don't get me wrong - I love the book with all my heart and highly recommend it to anyone who has yet to read it.) You see in the book, King gives us a wonderful (and All-American) ghost story in the form of a haunted car. And not just any haunted car either - Christine (as she is named by her first owner Roland LaBey) is a 1958 Plymouth Fury. And Fury is an apt last name for her (because make no mistake about it, Christine is all woman and as they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.) This should be enough of an explanation - The car is possessed by some unknown force. That's it. But King goes on to explain exactly why Christine is the way she is, and this is where I feel he goes wrong. By shining a light on the monster, you make it less scary.The movie does not make the same mistake. What John Carpender (and screenwriter Bill Phillips) do is trim the fat from the story. Christine's mysterious past is once again put in the shadows where it belongs, and what we're left is a love story. As soon as he lays eyes on her rotting away in some backwoods yard on his way home from a miserable first day at school, Arnie Cunningham falls head over heels in love with Christine. And she falls in love with him. And you and I as viewers buy this strange love story completely.At the time it was released, the early-80's teen slasher movie trend (which ironically enough was started by Carpender's Halloween) was in full swing. And while Christine is a movie that focuses on teenagers, it does not fall into slasher territory at all. What you have with this movie is good solid story-telling. From the solid script to Donald Morgan's camera work, right down to the performances (particularly from Keith Gordon chewing the scenes as Arnie). Christine is a great movie that holds up twenty-fives years after her release. Hell, that would make her a genuine antique, although she still smells like new - and that's the best smell in the world. Except for (BLEEP).",Christine
238,dannystaples666,Classic.,10,30 May 2019,An all time classic film. One you can watch over and over again. If you havent seen this. You are missing out. A must watch.,Christine
239,lea_tee1187,the reasons why,1,11 June 2005,"i think that Christine is like many adaptations of Stephen King stories, they just cannot compete with the books. several adaptations, like the Shining and Misery are great films on their own but they are just rubbish when you compare them to the books. the one exception to this is the Shawshank Redeption which is the exact copy of the story. in the film Christine however i think that the way Buddy Reperton and the others are killed in the gas explosion is totally lame, in fact the whole film gives the completely wrong impression about the car. it doesn't explain to the audience why the car kills people, or rather why and how the car is used to kill people or even why Arnie is drawn to the car. all in all i think that the director should be ashamed of himself for totally trashing a masterpiece of a story.",Christine
240,tanergode,"Deathride, or How I Loved a Car",10,6 September 1999,"If you don't like John Carpenter or Stephen King, then don't rent the movie. If you never heard who these two people are, then grab the movie and hurry home...I watched the movie on video in 1986, but missed its theatrical release in 1983 and wanted to see it after I read a review about the movie in the German weekly ""BRAVO"" and saw some attractive excerpts from the film on German TV. I read the book by Stephen King after I watched the movie (always first watch the movie, then read the book by book-to-film movies). I still have it on video and watch it about once a month...The movie is good, in terms of Carpenter and King, and it could not be very loyal to the book because of time limitations. Hence, this movie is John Carpenter's Christine. Cars are my hobby but after Christine, my life turned into post- and past-Christine eras. I'm in love with the American oldimers and as I live in Turkey there are many of them around, most of them in perfect shape. I learned so much about Christine (a 1958 Plymouth Sports Coupé, Two-Door, Pillarless, Twin Four-Barrel Carb. V-8 Engine, Automatic Tranmission with Dashboard Control) that I memorized the car.Arnie Cunningham... Christine could not get a better victim, and Keith Gordon plays it wonderfully. His part of the role he played before he meets the car and that after is much more impressive. I could see a part of myself reflected in Arnie. Note the scene where Arnie ""gets"" his father...According to the German ""BRAVO"" weekly, about 16 cars were completely or partially destroyed during the making of the movie, and many parts were made of fiberglass and other easy to shape materials; a '58 Fury was and still is rare.I have the score of the movie on CD. After many years, I could get a brandnew LP of the sountrack. The music is as important and as good as the movie. Some people will watch and then forget the movie; for them another flick with a car. But on some people it will have the effect of a trigger. They will not be able to forget it; the movie, the car, the music, Carpenter and King...But that what impressed and scared me most is that the car uses (lyrics of) popular songs of its time to ""talk"". You don't realize this and have to see the movie again (note ""You keep on knockin' but you can't come in""). And every time you watch it again, you note something new (like the sign ""IN GOD WE TRUST, EVERYONE ELSE PAY CASH"" in Darnell's office, shortly before Christine takes him for a ""Deathride...""Don't lose time, turn off the lights and press ""PLAY"". And whatever your car is, sometimes say you love him (or her), and softly touch its hood ornament...Tank you Christine...

241,Black_dragon92,One Of My Favorite Movies Ever,9,31 May 2006,"This is one of those classic demonic possession movies. Christine is one of the best movie... things (would she be considered a monster or demon?), and is pure evil and she kills anybody who crosses her by running them down. She's a literal version of hell on wheels, and is cool. I like the soundtrack to it, which is full of 80's rock which fits the moment. Arnie is a good character and fits the typical nerd in school who ends up getting revenge through Christine. The book, however, reveals him to be possessed by Roland D. LeBay (a.k.a. the old guy who sold him Christine). I read the book, and I like both the book and movie, but in typical fashion, the book was better. However, I think there should be a sequel to Christine (Spoiler approaching), since after they destroyed her and a piece of her was moving at the end. Also, the book ends where there was a report in the newspaper of a hit and run by a mysterious car, and the person that was killed was supposedly one of the guys who trashed Christine.Other than straying from the possession of Arnie part of the book, Christine is a good movie. I recommend it for ANYBODY who hasn't seen it.",Christine

Carpenter doesn't take the time needed to build the characters, but instead makes the movie solely about Christine, not about Roland LeBay.... no not George LeBay, his dead brother that they completely ripped out of the movie. The book was honestly one of my favorites, but after watching this movie, I'm even more disappointed than when Star Wars episode 9 came out.... There is so much more that was left out of the movie from Dennis and Leigh's relationship to the fact that Arnie doesn't know that Christine/LeBay are the ones who killed everyone. Plus Arnie slowly changing into someone who acts like Roland. The movie should be narrated by Dennis... so he can describe how Arnie and him have been best friends since they were little. Oh and they did a really crap job on showing how Arnie died at the end... it's supposed to be sad but they are just like... oh well...

Carpenter's direction is so (typically) lousy that it makes the movie a parody of itself. The people in the film rarely act even remotely as real people would under the circumstances (accounting for ""suspension of disbelief"" that is assumed to accept the premise)---the protagonists are often seen standing around waiting for Christine to do her thing, rather than reacting as any normal person would, and it becomes --- well, boring, because you wait with them.

When it comes to the novel, easily one of the best efforts by Stephen King. For a huge fan of King, this movie and the novel are to be seen and read again and again, and again. A young, introvert comes across a used car, way past its sell-by date and falls in love with it... err 'her'. Slowly, but surely, the car, Christine, takes control of Arnie's life...And so, Stephen King creates one of the most enthralling stories ever.

The Movie starts in the 1958 where the car (a 1958 Plymouth Belvedere) or ""Christine"" Injures one factory worker kills another and when you first see its red while the cars around it are white. This scene does more than just show you how ""Bad to the Bone"" Christine is. It's a prelude you might not catch on right away but it shows that first of all Christine is demon possessed as Christine can do things on her own even though she is a car. Second she knows what she wants. She doesn't want to be white, to blend in. She wants to be the car you brag about this is ""Christine and she is one amazing Vehicle"". Third Christine can just decide what she looks like. Now let's Jump forward to 1979 and meet Arnie Cunningham. Arnie is a dweeb fortunately he is good friends with hot shot Wide Receiver Dennis Guilder who makes life livable for Arnie literally he almost gets killed by, psycho named Buddy Repperton who is the main bully. But Arnie soon finds Christine the car he becomes instantly attached why you might ask like Arnie said, ""Maybe it's just that for the first time in my life, I've found something that's uglier than me. And I know I can fix her up."" So he dose fix her and there is an immediate change in his character he is now a complete greaser. From his attitude to dressing like The Fonz. Then the bullies brake in and destroy Christine. When he finds out he yells at his girlfriend. Then later he yells at his parent's and tells them it's their fault for not letting him keep the car at the house.He comes back to Will Darnell's Garage the tone of the movie is he is very sad and professes his love for Christine. Christine hills herself and goes after the bullies she kills Moochie Wells proving that she doesn't mind getting hurt in the process. Later on she kills the other boys who hurt her including Buddy. Arnie's Friend's Dennis and Leigh get to gather and decide they need to help their Arnie.

251,jakemetr,This is a really great film for daydreamers,9,5 May 1999,"This film is great for sub-conscience daydreaming power-seekers of which I think, behind all the facades, a lot of people are.  People who are everyday normals but at the back of their mind want to be noticed, and this film allows your mind to part sub-consciously day-dream of the power you would have owning a car like the amazing Christine.  This film is truly brill and allows the dreaming but also adds reality, due to the most unlikely event of a car becoming alive, because dreams are often far off from reality and films like this allow the dreaming but keep the world safe because of the un-likeliness of it, rather than films of serial killing maniacs that people may try to emulate.9/10",Christine
252,mattandlaila,"A perfect movie , with a good storyline",10,14 April 2006,"A very entertaining film i really enjoyed the thought of a car that can restore itself. While watching this movie with my wife i made it clear to her it would be great to own such a vehicle considering she wrecked 5 of mine ,,, The car was a true piece of work ,,cars from the 50,s always had an appeal to them ,,i guess the love story angle ,,that we all share a young guy and his 1st car who will ever forget there 1st car? also what brings the movie closer to heart is the buying or obtaining an old junk ,,and personally fixing or restoring it,,many of us had tried it and failed but the dream is there,,and last i do know many guys that would put there car before there girlfriends,,its those reality's that make this film so entertaining,, A great movie with a good storyline",Christine
253,toddnewton-08131,Pretty Good Movie,8,27 June 2020,Just saw this movie and I have to say that it was quite enjoyable to watch. There were a few loose ends though such as they never explained or showed what happened to the car when it got built to give it powers. And secondly there was no resolution or meaning to the blonde girl who seemed interested in the lead character (footballer) at the beginning. So I have no idea why they included her subplot in the movie.But overall I did get into the movie and the guy who played Artie acted very well between playing a believable nerd and a cocky and malevolent person from midway through the film.I would give it a 9 but the loose ends reduced my score to an 8/10.,Christine
254,hitparader,Still holds up after 20 years,9,30 November 2006,"After 20 years, the scenes of high school life in the late 70's and a late 50's auto production line are still some of the most accurate of any Hollywood film. Carpenter's camera work is excellent and the special effects still look great, years before anyone heard of digital effects. You can definitely see a Hitchcock influence in the scene blocking, especially in one great camera move in the Plymouth factory in the beginning of the movie. One of the most overlooked films of the 1980's. Would love to see this remade today, using digital effects techniques. I just don't think there are too many 1958 Plymouths left anymore!",Christine
255,olds_966,Fantastic movie!,10,6 January 2007,"I love this movie, i've seen it it over and over again. At the first place i love all this American cars from the fifty^s and sixty's, the Plymouth Fury is one of the nicest cars apart from the Chevy Bel Air, De Sotos and Cadillacs. I have a friend he bought a Fury because of this movie! His car looks exactly like in the movie. I like everything in this movie, the cool soundtrack in the beginning, the camera, illumination, acting, everything. Very good and professional job! I would like to see more movies like this. I like this kind of movies. I have this movie in my video collection. I think that anybody who like these old cars, like me, should watch this movie...",Christine
256,AussieGlen,"Body by Plymouth, Soul by Satan.",9,17 May 2002,"An excellent and entertaining movie. As is often the case with a movie adaptation of a book, full appreciation can only be gained by reading the book to help relate to some of the story undertones and characters better. A car enthusiast or Stephen King fan will love the movie, the rest should find it enjoyable even if it is classed as ""horror"".While the movie does have it's share of faults, these can be overlooked to some extent. Continuity is a small problem, but when 16-20 ""identical"" cars are used to make a movie this has to be expected. Those with a strong knowledge of the Plymouth marque will spot some discrepancies, but after all this is a movie and not a documentary.The soundtrack is excellent, and it IS still available. Don't be surprised if you go looking for it one day soon!If you see this movie in your video store, it is well worth watching!",Christine
257,iamolc-1,Not all Novels Make Good Movies,2,13 May 2008,"These comments refer to the 2003 20th Anniversary DVD release.In a way, Stephen King and John Carpenter deserve each other. Each has produced an uneven body of work. Halloween, for instance, despite its forced sequels, was a truly heart-pounding thriller. The Thing was a gross-out bomb. Christine stands, in my opinion, as King's most enduring work. By contrast, Pet Semetary was also a gross-out bomb. John Carpenter's movie version of Christine is somewhere in the middle between success and failure. It is successful because, even if one hasn't read the book, a viewer will stick with it simply to find out how everything turns out. It is a failure because it tries to use shorthand to fill in for the material that made King's novel worthwhile. In interviews with this DVD both Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips proclaim that they decided to eliminate the Roland D. LeBay back story in favor of making the car the centerpiece. They try to fill in by introducing LeBay's brother, George, as a sort of surrogate, right down to Roland's filthy back brace. Readers will connect the brace with the Roland character in the novel, but in the film it merely distracts from the rest of the scene. They also try to fill in by crafting a completely original opening assembly line sequence that supposedly introduces the evil that is present in the car that would one day be called Christine. This one decision loses the impact of the novel, whose point is that the evil which possessed the car came from Roland LeBay's own poisoned soul--and that evil persisted after his death. By placing the evil in an inanimate object (and then attempting to persuade us that car is somehow alive) Carpenter and Phillips cause us to cease to care. Each of us has dealt with inanimate objects which appear to have a will of their own, but Christine is stretches us beyond the limit. The deleted scenes included with the 2003 release show evidence that, in limited ways, Carpenter and Phillips understood this. For instance, in one hospital scene, Dennis has Arnie sign his cast. In a deleted scene, occurring a bit later, Dennis asks for another signature. The point, of course, is that the two are completely different. Arnie is possessed by the evil soul of Roland LeBay. The minutes devoted to the opening sequence should have been used to flesh out this back story.Readers of the novel know that King set the story in a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. The complexity of that setting is itself a kind of character. Within minutes, we discover that the movie is set in California, a part of America that most Pittsburghers would perceive as particularly shallow. Carpenter undoubtedly did this to avoid extensive winter sequences, including one particularly brutal blizzard. It's but another short cut that trivializes the story. King's novel is a highly effective meditation on the persistence of evil. The movie inspires no terror and no dread. It isn't even particularly humorous. Instead, we stay with it just to see how it comes out. The great strength of King's novel is that it was about people and only marginally about the car. In casting unknowns, and then buying 24 1958 Plymouths, Carpenter asked us to focus on the car. It doesn't work. Here is my proposal: Let's ask Frank Darabont to take a run at a remake. He did a wonderful job with the King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (shortened to The Shawshank Redemption for the film) and the serial novel The Green Mile. Those films work because Darabont took King's work seriously in terms of time and place, and because he took the time to develop the characters. A remake of Christine at Darabont's hands, at about the same length as Shawshank or Green Mile, would be worth seeing.",Christine
258,Roboby,Gotta love it,10,2 August 2003,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had read the book and loved it, so therefor I was reluctant to see the movie. I didn't want to see the big screen dishonor the book in any way. But, as it happens, I loved it! A lot of people would say ""This is a horror, it's supposed to be scary!!"" And a lot of people are right in this regard, it wasn't very scary at all. At least to me. But...the way Arnie turns from such a geek to a cool, tough, bad-ass was pretty awesome. Also I liked the depth of all the characers relationships with one another. It definately stirred some serious emotions when Buddy and his goons tore up Christine. Most of all though, I think the car herself was what made the movie as good as it is. Just the style and freshness of the '58 Plymouth Fury kicked ass. If you're reading reviews (like this one) trying to decide if you even want to see it, I say go for it. What have you got to lose, after all? The hour and a half you would be spending trying to find a review for a movie you decide to see, you could have already watched Christine. That's my advice.",Christine
259,emakuck,Christine is a 1983 horror film set in 1978 and is based off of Stephen King's novel Christine.,9,25 November 2012,"Looking at the movie poster we can't help but get chills as the 1958 Plymouth Fury coldly stares at us. The film captures the audience, horrifying us and making us believe in the terror depicted on the screen. The movie can truly be defined as an effective horror film. Despite the age of the film, it captures us and in the end, we can't help but wish that Dennis (John Stockwell) had never turned around to let Arnie (Keith Gordon) see the Plymouth Fury.After a close analysis of the film and looking further behind what meets the eye, it is clear Christine succeeds as a true horror film because it displays a number of horror fundamentals. Christine doesn't just rely on the brutal killing and abnormality of a car coming to life to shock the audience. There is more emotional tension in the movie as we see the change in Arnie Cunningham. In Laurie Werner's ""Horror Movies: Why We Love to Scream in the Dark"", she mentions several devices that seem to scare audiences. In Werner's article, she states that ""a traditional device has been transformation/metamorphosis that manifests the bestial nature that lies within"" (Werner 58). What is effective about this in Christine is the idea that Arnie Cunningham is as typical as it gets for a high school teenager. A scene that displays Arnie's change is when he and Dennis are driving in Christine together. Arnie takes his hands off the wheel to show Dennis the ""great alignment"" of the car. Seeing Dennis in shear terror, he asks what he's afraid of. ""I'm afraid of you, man,"" explains Dennis reluctantly (Christine). Arnie ""transitions from geeky to cocky to obsessed as Christine gets a hold of his soul,"" states Nigel Honeybone of Horrornews Reviews. We witness this transformation of Arnie showing us it could happen to anyone in the audience, making it truly horrifying.",Christine
260,marcuss9929,Squandered potential.,4,26 December 2017,"It goes without saying movies rarely live up to their novels, but wow this one really strayed farther than a Plymouth can run. I truly wonder if Mr. Carpenter read the book or just the jacket cover. The sad part is all the ingredients were there. The casting was good. Special effects very impressive. Soundtrack memorable. I'll give you one example of how silly this was. One of my favorite characters in the novel Will Darnell, a crafty old dodger, and one of the few smart enough to realize what Christine really is, gets killed in the movie by getting in the driver's seat after just watching the car drive past him and park itself.",Christine
261,rbuck01,"Pretty Cars, Cringeworthy Dialogue",6,19 August 2014,"This movie is gorgeous. No hyperbole, I mean it. There are so many subtle yet stunning flourishes throughout -- that ever so slight cool tinting like this movie is perpetually in a crisp autumn. I wouldn't mind watching it on mute. The soundtrack is OK; sometimes it is superb, but sometimes it is not (rock 'n' roll songs, good; early 80s score, dated). The problem for me is just that it does not do too well in the 'suspension of disbelief'. For me, if a storyline doesn't do it, a good sense of humor will reel me in. But this movie sorely lacks such. It isn't Twin Peaks (the sense of absurd humor is what made me love that first season so much). To give another comparison, I prefer the Futurama parody to this original. The Futurama episode shows an understanding of when a horror story begs to be intentionally comedic.There is a scene in this film where Arnie discovers that the car has been totaled and defecated on. Arnie screams something awful at Leigh, sounding out of character yet unbearably predictable at the same time -- I cringed mighty hard. And if the dialogue does not unintentionally make me cringe, it frequently makes me want to laugh (just not in the good way; more like, I give up and don't know what else to do). I wish the characters would stop talking so much about how creepy the car is because it has the opposite effect on me. But, if this was a silent movie, I think that I would be in love.I don't regret watching it.",Christine
262,ChrisSimpson,One of the Best Teen Angst Love Stories of the 80s.,10,16 November 2004,"*Possible Spoilers*I hope John Carpenter appreciates what he did with this film. I saw the film before I read the book, and I must say I liked the film better. Stephen Kings books usually have the same ""why"" behind the ""what"", and Christine was no different. However, John Carpenter took all of the ""why"" element found in the book out and made it a love story between a nerdy teen Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon) and a run down car named Christine, which I believe added some substance and improved the story in ways King never imagined. Watching Arnie's transition from nerd to almost greaser is a tense and creepy process, with a huge nod going to Gordon. Carpenter makes the atmosphere with his directing, and the mood is always somber with one of my Favorite Carpenter Scores. While movies like The Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles were showing one side of the coin, Christine showed the other. What most look at as a ""killer car"" movie is really much deeper and in my opinion the subtext shows a side of the teen years that most would be more likely to remember. This is a under-rated movie that shows more about isolation and life in high school than anything that happened in Shermer, Illinois.Check it out!",Christine

264,ALIANATOR,Aconcept before it's time,10,21 July 2006,"If this story was retold using now days advanced effects it still would not be as good as the original film.The actors were superbly cast and the film setting was perfect to capture the feelings required for the best of King and Carpenters combined work.The question ""is the book better than the film?"" causes arguments amongst fans, my feelings on this subject is this:- The book was written using every inch of Kings mind and with him having a great imagination he holds nothing back as he wrote it but you can't always make all that imagination feasible so changes to the story had to be made! The book is meant to be read as a finished project and the Film's script was written JUST for the film and was never meant to follow the book! In summery, they were both written as two separate projects neither one should follow the other as if one was the bible and so the film is not wrong according the book and the book also is not a contradictory to the film.The music and the choice of songs concentrated a great film into an excellent production. If only they would release a copy of Christine that would play 50's music as you turn the pages when we read it just before bed.........late at night...........in the dark.............ahhhhhh!.....spooky!God himself only knows why there has never been a sequel, it's left wide open for her return in one way or another!

265,sfunk1x,"If you think it's like the book, you'll be disappointed...",7,31 October 2006,"It's not like the book at all, really.However, I think it gets the story across, and quite frankly, if the movie had never been made, Christine would have just been another King novel that probably few people would have read or known about (Except King fans). Now, a lot of people have seen this movie, and many of them haven't read the book.I saw the movie first as a young child, then I read the book years ago while I was in grade school. It was the first novel I had ever read. Hard for a 10 year old (or however old I was then, maybe younger?) to absorb all the details, so I've purchased Christine and I've spent some time reading it at the local 24 hour Starbucks (for safety!).I have one thing to say. If the movie had been turned into a 5 hour saga, ala something like The Stand, much more could have been done. Watching Dennis and Leigh try to save Arnie and his family would have been very touching. Watching LeBay and Christine kill each of the people that were negatively involved with Arnie would have been a very terrifying experience. Knowing that LeBay left Christine at Darnell's during the final fight scene (implied?) to go back to Arnie - and then Arnie fighting LeBay off (and thus dying in the wreck with his mother).And finally, the ending - where Dennis makes the connections between what Mercer told him in the hospital - that Mercer had seen to that Christine was crushes - but that the people handling her had been hurt by her hulk.... and then mentioning that the last bully had been killed by an unidentified car that slammed into the movie theater...You be the judge. Christine wasn't stopped by a crusher. You can't kill a ghost!",Christine

I want to see a Christine part 2 or a movie before Christine met Arnie,telling her story of how she came to be ""Alive"". The book is twice as good as the movie. The book is a must read for any Christine fan. The book is much more detailed than the movie. The movie would have to have been 15 hours long to cover the story in the book. The book concentrates more on Roland D. Lebay possessing Arnie,and Christine is just an instrument of Lebays terror.Also in the book Leigh and Dennis have a romantic relationship that they did not have in the movie,which only fuels Lebays anger because of his obsession with Leigh.",Christine
