0,TheLittleSongbird,A beautiful bore,4,23 February 2013,"This adaptation of Anna Karenina is a very flat adaptation of one of the greatest pieces of literature, but actually it is not only a failure as an adaptation but disappointing also on its own merits. It is not without its redeeming qualities of course, the costumes and sets are gorgeous and some of the best of the year, the music is beautifully composed, Jude Law is a superbly restrained and dignified Karenin and Matthew Macfadyen and Domhnall Gleeson are similarly excellent as Stiva and Levin respectively. Keira Knightley in the title role however didn't do it for me. She tries but comes across as too young and too selfish, and I also didn't care at all for her over-earnest mannerisms. The weak link of the cast is the woeful miscast that is Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Vronsky, often too moody and wooden as well as too effeminate and foppish, so much so it comes across as creepy. The script is very stilted and lacking in any kind of heart. There is a lot of melodrama as well but it comes across as forced, while the switching from play-within-a-play to film is confusing. The story similarly suffers from pedestrian pacing and the drama and characters are too thin to make us properly care and that is including Anna, whose attempts to overcome her suffering is entirely too trivialised here. Even bigger of a problem was Joe Wright's direction, I loved Pride and Prejudice and especially Atonement so I hoping a similar kind of directing job. But Wright often seems to be paying attention to himself too much, with the camera work too incongruous and surreal. Everything, from the gimmicky theatrical elements to the ball scene where the dancing is so robotic and where you don't have a clue what dance style it's supposed to be, plays too much of an overblown musical but without song and dance. In conclusion a disappointment even on its own, for me a beautiful bore is a very apt summing up as to how I felt about it. See the Greta Garbo and Vivien Leigh films instead. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Anna Karenina
1,SnoopyStyle,no heat no chemistry,4,1 September 2013,It's 1874 Imperial Russia. Aristocratic Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) has a cold marriage to Count Alexei Karenin (Jude Law). They have a son. She falls for dashing cavalry officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).This is the latest interpretation of the classic novel. There is no doubt that this is a good looking film visually but the actors don't have enough chemistry. All the acting is stiff and mannered. I can't find the required heat between Keira Knightley and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. It's tiresome.,Anna Karenina
2,claudio_carvalho,"Despite the Wonderful Art Direction and Costume Design, A Weak Version of Tolstoy's Classic Romance",5,3 March 2013,"In 1874, in the Imperial Russia, the aristocratic Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) travels from Saint Petersburg to Moscow to save the marriage of her brother Prince Oblonsky, who had had a love affair with his housemaid. Anna Karenina has a loveless marriage with her husband, Count Alexei Karenin (Jude Law), and they have a son.Anna meets the cavalry officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) at the train station and they feel attracted by each other. Soon she learns that Vronsky will propose Kitty (Alicia Vikander), who is the younger sister of her sister-in-law Dolly. Anna satisfactorily resolves the infidelity case of her brother and Kitty invites her to stay for the ball.However, Anna Karenina and Vronsky dance in the ball, calling the attention of the conservative society. Soon they have a love affair that will lead Anna Karenina to a tragic fate.This is the fourth version of ""Anna Karenina"" that I have watched and despite the wonderful art direction and costume design, this is a weak version of the Tolstoy's classic romance. Greta Garbor is unforgettable in the role of Anna Karenina (1935); Vivien Leigh and Sophie Marceau also have good performances in the versions of 1948 and 1997, but Keira Knightley is miscast in this role, since this excellent actress is too young to perform Anna Karenina. Further, the screenplay focuses mostly in her affair like a boring soap opera and for those that have not read the romance or seen the other versions, she seems to be a promiscuous and insecure woman and not a woman in love in a repressive society. The screenplay entwining theater with cinema is also weird, differently from ""Il Viaggio di Capitan Fracassa"". I have the intention of seeing the other versions of Anna Karenina again for a better comparison with this 2012 version. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Anna Karenina""",Anna Karenina
3,nogodnomasters,All the world's a stage,8,23 February 2018,"This is a bold artsy unorthodox version of the novel. If you are not a fan of indie, stage, and symbolism to the point of absurdity, this isn't your film. The theme of the novel is ""no one may build their happiness on another's pain."" This takes on a duo meaning as it not only shows us this in personal life but in the class differences in Russia. The stage is the first major metaphor/symbol you will notice. The aristocracy live their live on the stage. It is a world of drama, make believe and one that will soon draw its final curtain. The workers are off stage and live in the rafters and audience supporting the rich. Who is really happy?The locomotion movement and sound represented the emotions of Anna, thrusting when she feels raw passion and falling silent at the end. In addition to the symbolism, the film has the irony of Anna attempting to patch up an infidelity relationship only to fall into one. Perhaps inadvertently, the novel portrays how women are trapped inside a man's world.Konstantin seems to represent ""us"" in this film as he is a man who freely travels between two worlds as he seeks his happiness. While prudish, he is constant as his name suggests.The themes and symbolism are very heavy. Like reading a Russian novel, you feel your head explode as you try to take it all in. Not for everyone and you should know after 10 minutes of viewing.Parental Guidance: No f-bombs. Near male nudity. Artsy sex scenes.",Anna Karenina
4,kosmasp,Breaking the theater wall,7,10 July 2013,"It is a tough movie to watch, especially if you have certain expectations. Be it because of the story or because of the stars in this movie itself. Whatever the case, the movie is almost trying to irritate people from the beginning. The setting and the changes of ""locations"" are sometimes being handled on the go. This might come off as annoying or as genius, depending on how you view things that is (no pun intended).The actors are doing a very good job, hopefully the setting won't ruin it for too many people. The ups and downs are shown nicely, as is the driving/destructive force within the characters. You will know where this is going (regardless if you know Anna K. or not), but if you let it, the movie will be intriguing while on its journey",Anna Karenina
5,lee_eisenberg,"believe me, I know when Russian names get mispronounced",8,11 February 2021,"Full disclosure: I've never read Leo Tolstoy's novel. Prior to watching Joe Wright's adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"", I only had a loose understand of the plot. Now that I've seen it, I'm impressed. Obviously the frequent mispronunciation of the Russian names irked me (and the overall pomp led me to make MST3K-style comments at the movie). But in general I found it to be a fine adaptation: the profound characters, the clever editing, and the Academy Award-winning costumes combined to create a movie that I recommend.It stars Keira Knightley, Jude Law, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kelly Macdonald, Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson, Ruth Wilson and Emily Watson. Put another way, it stars Elizabeth Swann, Sky Captain, John Lennon, Princess Merida, Lara Croft, Bill Weasley, Marisa Coulter and the eternal abused woman.",Anna Karenina
6,rmax304823,Skillfull Adaptation.,8,26 August 2013,"It occurred to me while watching this nifty version of Tolstoy's novel, which I haven't read in many years, that if you stripped away the ""philosophy"", the idealism, the issue of conformity, the social context, the tragic ending, and a couple of other things, what you're left with is a Harlequin love novel.What I mean is, a respectable socialite woman is married to some sort of bureaucratic functionary, falls in love with a dashing younger man, endures all sorts of strenuous suffering, and jumps under a train.Fortunately, you can't just discard all the other stuff because the romance is just an armature around which the writer has skillfully molded all that other stuff. Tom Stoppard did the screenplay, which is exceptional. The central issue is probably that dealt with by the sociologist David Riesman in ""The Lonely Crowd."" Looking at the conformity in growing suburbs of the 1950s, he saw it as a matter of tension between ""other-direct"" and ""inner-directed"" people or, in other words, between those who are driven to observe all the proper norms (like Karenin) and those who follow their ""internal gyroscopes"", like Anna and Vronsky. A dowager insults Anna in the opera by saying, ""I could be a friend if you broke the law. You broke the rules."" Keira Knightly, as Anna, is fine for the part. She's beautiful and sexy, of course, but she has a small symmetrical mouth that, when she grins, seems filled with prominent teeth. As she loses her wits, the grin becomes fixed and the teeth positively desperate. Make up has done a good job on her in her various emotional states. At the beginning, she's glamorous. By the end she's a pale, tortured, tangled mess.I rather liked Jude Law as Karenin. Okay, he's a little stiff, dull, and unimaginative, but he's not cruel or pompous. That's an improvement over Basil Rathbone's Karenin in the 1948 version with Vivian Leigh.Aaron Taylor-Johnson is Count Vronsky, who looks a bit like Gene Wilder and is always described as ""dashing,"" probably because he wears uniforms and races horses. He's a nice enough character -- not a philandering home wrecker -- but, like Anna, he's ruled by his emotions. He may lose the respect of Society but he remains true to Anna, despite her delusions of his schtupping some other good-looking babe (or the babe's mother).I gather the direction by Joe Wright has been needled for looking like a stage play. I have no idea where that criticism came from. There are a few scenes that are framed by an ornate proscenium, complete with lime lights. The last shot is of a theater's interior but the seats have been replaced by a sea of grass and wildflowers. However, there are no photographic tricks involved. No bodies falling in slow motion, no horrifying computer-generated images, no wobbling camera, only classic move-making techniques.The most stylized scenes come towards the end, reflections of Anna's madness, and they're effective. Tracking Vronsky to the railway station where she expects him to meet his fictional lover, Anna walks through sweeping tableaux in which a crowd of strangers is frozen in place and the architecture looks like the inside of a timber processing plant. It's spookier than any Twilight Zone episode.That last scene -- the theater filled with grass and wildflowers -- I think is meant to suggest the happiness found by a secondary character, Levin, who has retired with his new wife to the country and now works in the wheat fields with the men his father used to own, the ex Serfs. If these illiterate rustics ever spoke the way they do in the movie, if they ever voiced such deep questions about God and fate, then they're a lot more inquisitive than our own modern illiterate rustics.",Anna Karenina
7,blanche-2,amazingly beautiful,8,24 January 2014,"I notice that a fair number of people (like most of them) didn't like this version of ""Anna Karenina,"" adapted by Tom Stoppard and directed by Jon Wright. The film stars Keira Knightley, Jude Law, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Alicia Vikander.This is the third filmed adaptation of Tolstoy's novel that I've seen, the first being Greta Garbo's and the second Vivien Leigh's.Anna Karenina, married with a little boy, falls in love with Count Vronsky, a young soldier, and the two enter into a scandalous affair. She ultimately leaves her husband for him. At the time, Imperial Russia in 1874, this made her a social outcast.This version was by far the most opulent production, the most amazing costumes, cinematography, sets -- all absolutely splendid.I found myself rather detached from the two other versions of this, but the passion in this pulled me in. There was a great deal of sexual symbolism as well. Also different for me was the character of Karenin (Jude Law). In past films, I've always thought it was set up for the audience to think Karenin is a monster: cold, cruel, unloving. As portrayed by Law, he's nothing of the sort. He is a man who honors marriage, who honors his wife and considers her ""above reproach."" He warns her that if he gives her what she wants, it will put her in an untenable position. He would rather that she decided to stay.Frankly, this film makes Anna Karenina look like an idiot. Faced with becoming an outcast, she and Vronsky should have become a lot more discreet and left it at that. In the end, Anna becomes a victim of her own lust, hot-headedness, insecurity, and the terrible pressure she has put upon herself and Vronsky because of the way they have to live. She is a woman who has discovered sex in a way she never knew possible. Tolstoy thought lust a bad idea on which to base a relationship, so it is clear that Levin and Kitty (Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander) in their quiet contentment is preferable, as perhaps is Karenin and Anna, who have respect for one another.Keira Knightly is not Vivien Leigh or Greta Garbo. She's just stunningly, drop-dead gorgeous. The camera loves her. She is a bit too modern for the film, but she does convey Anna's passion.The best scene for me was early in the film, at the ball where she runs into Vronsky again. Heart-stopping in its tension. The entire film is very theatrical in presentation.Jude Law is astonishing as Karenin, totally embodying a strict, intelligent man who lives by certain standards.I always have a problem with Vronsky -- he's never someone I can see giving up your husband and child for. Fredric March - eh; Kieron Moore - better with a ruggedness, but I wasn't swept away. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, though a good actor, looked overly made up and wasn't rugged enough. If they had let him look as he does in real life, he would have been fine.If you want to see this story from another point of view (I believe), if you want to see breathtaking sets and costumes and strong style, this is the film for you. There is some excellent acting to be seen as well as some haunting music. It's up to you and how you see ""Anna Karenina.""",Anna Karenina
8,Quinoa1984,"In Russia, affair has you",7,8 November 2014,"Joe Wright's Anna Karenina is visually keen and 'kinda'-daring (like Lars von Trier's Dogville in spots, the 'World's a stage' approach, except still as a big costume drama with lavish sets, gorgeously costumed extras, and melodrama, or just soap opera, turns of the plot), and some very fine performances of Tom Stoppard adapted dialog, which is mostly a pleasure to hear spoken this well.It's also that time that I haven't seen in a while, if ever, where Kiera Knightley got me to give a damn about the (anti) heroine due to her own conviction in every scene. There's passion here, folks. Though, for me, Jude Law with his restraint and his super mixed are-these-things-feelings, stole his scenes curiously enough. And the smallest detail, cracking ones knuckles, made the biggest impression on me as opposed to the big set pieces (awesomely choreographed as they are).Recommended, especially as the kind of movie that should bring in crowds like Hollywood during the depression: watch well-off people deal with big emotional problems, looking good while doing it.",Anna Karenina
9,writers_reign,Anna On Upper Street,5,7 September 2012,"I really should know better; after all I did endure 'Atonement' and made it to the end (just) without a sick bag. Here we go again, folks; Joe - all I want is a Golden Rivet Award from ANY Festival in the world even the Rain Forest at a pinch - Wright is back working with Keira - I'm sooo beautiful I'm scared to look in the mirror in case I knock myself up - Knightly and for good measure they're roped in Tom (pretentious,Moi?) Stoppard and between them they give Tolstoy a right seeing to. By accident or design British television screened an earlier film adaptation of the novel on Sunday last but this time it boasted a Real director (Julien Duvivier), a Real actress (Vivien Leigh) who was, of course, also a REAL beauty, AND a Real actor in Ralph Richardson as Karenin. True they were lumbered - and I use the word advisedly - with a Vronsky who was solid Teak in the shape of Keiron Moore but three out of four isn't bad and it's three more than we get here. Superficially it's like one of those boxes of Quality Street that are popular as Christmas gifts, the difference being that unlike a tin of Quality Street you can get past the lovely illustrations on the outside and reveal a variety delightful chocolates within; here all you get is a pretty chocolate box with nothing inside. Apparently Wright's parents used to run a puppet theatre in Islington (for non-Londoners the main drag in Islington is Upper Street) and it seems one of the puppets was Keira Knightly and he couldn't resist taking her as a souvenir. The 'conceit' here is to set the story in a theatre so that like a drama by Brecht we are constantly aware that the whole thing is artificial. Joe, old son, if you REALLY want to see a film adaptation of a Russian classic set in a theatre have a swivel at Louis Malle's 'Vanya On 42nd Street'. Oops, you did, and liked it so much you thought you'd 'borrow' it. Got a great idea for your next project with Knightly. A remake of that Powell and Pressburger movie set in a convent in India. You'd need to tweak the title a tad and call it 'Hack Narcissus' which would describe succinctly the two best-known features of you and Knightly. Could you actually hack it though. Doubtful.",Anna Karenina
10,grantss,Good production but doesn't quite hit the spot,6,27 December 2015,"Good production but doesn't quite hit the spot. Set in 19th century Russia, a married aristocrat, Anna Karenina (played by Keira Knightley), starts an affair with a Count. After a while, the relationship becomes quite serious...A decent adaptation of the Tolstoy novel. Lavish costumes and sets, and a sense of the emptiness and superficiality of Russian aristocracy. However, for all its intrigues, just doesn't quite hit the spot. Not entirely engaging and seems to drag in segments. Some of the imagery was just to clever for its own good, ending up feeling pretentious.Solid performances all round. Jude Law is the best of the lot, as the conservative husband of Anna Karenina.",Anna Karenina
11,evanston_dad,An Experiment Gone Pretentiously Wrong,2,16 April 2013,"Dreadful screen adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's magnificent novel.Director Joe Wright, who made the very good ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the very forgettable ""Atonement,"" turns Tolstoy's novel into an incoherent mess. It's as if he stood over Baz Luhrmann's shoulder and decided that he was going to try to direct a film just like him. The problems with that are 1.) Luhrmann is a terrible director and should be emulated by no one and 2.) His style is completely wrong for ""Anna Karenina"" anyway. For some reason, Wright decides to stage the entire film as if it's a play in a run-down theatre, so actors sit on purposely artificial sets and we see them moving through the wings as they get ready to make their entrances. I get it, I get it. The Russian aristocracy was a study in theatricality and Wright wants to play up its superficiality. Which may have been fine as a framing device for the film, but he carries it through the entire thing until it becomes tedious. He also has his actors mug and mince around like they're performing broad music-hall comedy, a style of acting that is not only incongruous with the source material but doesn't even make sense within the context of the film as written (the screenplay is by Tom Stoppard).But the worst thing about this ""Anna Karenina"" is the casting, which -- aside from Jude Law, who isn't exactly well cast as Anna's husband but is a good enough actor to pull it off -- doesn't get a single thing right. If Keira Knightley isn't a disaster as Anna, it's only because she's not a powerful enough screen presence to be a disaster. Her jutting jaw and gritted teeth have never been filmed to less flattering effect; and this is the character who's supposed to walk into a ball and command the entire room without even trying to. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky looks like an actor from a gay porn film, and acts fey enough throughout the film to be in one (Vronsky would never hold a cigarette like that!) He sidles through the film like a boy in a high school play trying to look virile without understanding what virile means. Matthew MacFadyen is thanklessly cast as Stiva and plays him like a buffoon. And Domhnall Gleeson is Levin, a character who should be powerful looking and outdoorsy, but as cast here instead looks like he should be sitting in a student cafe writing editorials about Communism.Defenders of the film have said that there's no point in making yet another version of ""Anna Karenina"" if the filmmakers are just going to make yet one more faithful version of it, which I actually agree with. I'm not opposed to experimenting with the classics. I just think this particular experiment goes wildly and pretentiously wrong.Grade: D",Anna Karenina
12,ferguson-6,All of the Stage is the World ...,6,9 December 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. We are all familiar with the phrase ""All the World's a Stage"", and director Joe Wright and writer Tom Stoppard twist the phrase into ""All the Stage is the World"" in their re-imagining of Leo Tolstoy's literary classic. With a bold and ambitious vision, the story plays out mostly within the confines of a theatre ... utilizing not just the stage, but the rafters, backstage and all nooks. This is pulled off in a most operatic manner with heavy production, remarkable sets and costumes, and the use of curtains and doors for a change of scene. Additionally, most of the actors move like dancers and the dialogue delivery borders on musicality.Tolstoy's story has been adapted for the screen in more than two dozen versions, including two from screen legend Greta Garbo. Who better to take on the role of Anna than Keira Knightley, the ultimate period actress of our generation. It's her third film with Joe Wright (Atonement, Pride and Prejudice) and by far, the least traditional in presentation. This version focuses on the affair between Anna and Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson from Kick-Ass), and her determination to throw aside her standing in Russian high-society ... and even give up her son.We do gets bits and pieces of the other story lines: Oblonsky (Matthew Macfadyen) provides some comic relief from the start despite his extra-marital wanderings from his wife (Kelly Macdonald); the stoic determination of the bureaucrat Karenin (Jude Law) as he insists on maintaining the proper illusion; and the down-to-earth landowner Levin (Domhnall Gleeson, Brendan's son) with his pursuit of perfect farming and the beautiful Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Some viewer disappointment creeps in when we realize that Levin's story is minimized for the torrid love affair of Anna and Vronsky. Levin's story is allowed to sneak outside the theatre setting ... presumably since he is the only character living in the real world.Tolstoy's powerful story is stymied to some degree by the lack of sympathy we feel for Anna ... while we certainly understand her lack of connection to the cold Karenin, we never sense more than a physical attraction and unreasonable wish between she and Vronsky. The strength of the story stems from Anna's knowing willingness to surrender her place in society for the sake of what should be true love. When one of the society ladies states she could forgive Anna for breaking the law, but not for breaking the rules, we fully comprehend what a ridiculous state those in high society exist.It's difficult to imagine a wide acceptance of this unique presentation; however, the technical aspects of the film deserve much Oscar consideration - cinematography, set design, costumes, etc are all first rate. And Keira Knightly proves again that costume dramas are where she is at her best.",Anna Karenina
13,HotToastyRag,A beautiful experience to watch,7,9 December 2017,"I'm not sure if anyone was more excited than I was to see the newest remake of Anna Karenina, besides the families of the cast and crew. Sure, the story isn't that great, but Keira Knightley is my favorite actress, and the preview made it look like a moving art gallery rather than a film. Even though I didn't end up adding this one to my permanent collection, it was very entertaining.The reason the film didn't work was because of the casting. In the story, the title character is unhappily married to an older, pious man, and she has an affair with a handsome, virile, young man. Jude Law was cast as the husband, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson was cast as the lover, and this is why the film makes no sense. They tried to ugly Jude up and made sure he wore a perpetual scowl, but the audience is still very much aware he's still Jude Law! Why would she stray? And if she must, why wouldn't she choose someone so incredibly handsome, charming, and full of appeal that the audience understands and excuses her betraying ""Alfie""? There wasn't a single moment of the film that I was rooting for Aaron, and the fact that Keira sacrificed everything for him made me not respect or like her character.That crucial criticism aside, the rest of the film is incredibly beautiful to watch. It truly is an experience, not just a film. Joe Wright, director of Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, knows how to capture Keira Knightley perfectly on camera. She's so incredibly gorgeous, it's almost stunning to believe she's real.The costumes, sets, and production values are some of the richest, most beautiful I've ever seen. The colors both blend and stand out among one another, and if you press pause during any given moment, you could easily imagine the frozen frame pained and mounted upon your wall. While the film took home a well-deserved Academy Award for Jacqueline Durran's costume design, it was grossly under-appreciated in its other technical aspects, and Keira was once again ignored for her incredible performance.Seamus McGarvey's cinematography, combined I'm sure with Joe Wright's direction and the way Tom Stoppard's script was crafted, is what separates Anna Karenina from ordinary historical films. The entire film is sewn together seamlessly, with scenes folding into one another in different creative ways. One scene may show the characters walking off a literal stage, and the camera follows them as they walk to a different setting. Another may show an indoor curtain parting, showing the audience the snow outside, and the film continues outdoors. If you're not expecting it, the style might feel jarring at first, but once you're aware of the fluid structure, it's glorious.Watch the preview to get a feel for the style and see if you think you might like it. Even if you're rooting against Keira because of her serious lack of judgement, it really is an engrossing film with many elements to appreciate, including a supporting cast with Kelly Macdonald, Matthew Macfadyen, Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Holliday Grainger, Ruth Wilson, Michelle Dockery, and Emily Watson.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are a couple of scenes where the camera spins in a circle, and it might make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Anna Karenina
14,phd_travel,Horribly Miscast - The Sophie Marceau version is 10 times better,1,20 May 2013,"If you want a modern color version watch the 2012 Sophie Marceau version set to sumptuous Tchaikovsky music and stunningly filmed on location in Russia.This 2012 version is terrible. The theater setting is absurd. It's so limiting and claustrophobic to have an artificial stage setting. The modern music is incongruous and doesn't fit the setting.What a waste of a talented cast. Keira is beautiful but a bit too high strung for the role. But the major miscasting is with Jude Law and Aaron Johnson. Jude is too young and vital for Karenin - it should have been someone middle aged and stuffy. Aaron Johnson looks clownish with the blonde hair. Why didn't they just leave his hair brown? He is also too young and not manly enough for Vronsky. He looks ill at ease in his uniform and a bit adolescent. Someone slightly older and more intense would have been better.Terrible screenplay, direction and casting. The dance sequence is so ugly and not romantic or elegant. The horse race indoors is just so silly. Don't watch this it will spoil your image of Anna Karenina.",Anna Karenina
15,gradyharp,A Sumptuous Feast for the Eye and Ear and Mind - BRILLIANT!,10,5 December 2012,"There have been many cinematic versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel ANNA KARENINA but for this viewer none matches the creative excellence and power of this very different version. Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay for this adaptation and the work was directed with eye toward timeless artistry by Joe Wright. There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays, but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well. The flavor of Tolstoy's story and mood are maintained and yet made somehow more vital by Wright's electing to place this story as though it were happening on a theater stage (including catwalks, backstage, audience and theater boxes etc.) The story is theatrical and Wright embellishes the last of the Czarist days with great aplomb.The story needs no summary: Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley more beautiful to behold and brilliant in acting than ever) is married to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law in a tour de force acting role) and is happy in her station with her slightly cool husband but very warm young son. Then quite unexpectedly her eyes meet those of the wealthy Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor- Johnson in a career making turn) and their love is immediate. The flirtation is enhanced by some of the most beautiful waltzing choreography on film. We are in St. Petersburg, Russia and divorce is something only a man /husband can initiate so as the love affair reaches a point of no return Anna must decide whether to bear the shame of a divorced woman or just be the mistress of the incredibly handsome Count and remain married. In contrast to the Anna/Vronsky duet is the passion of the country lad Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) for the aristocratic Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and throughout the story the two forms of love are paralleled. Anna becomes pregnant with Vronsky's child, an act that quietly infuriates Karenin as it makes Anna's affair public - a condition no one can tolerate in that society - and subsequently results in Anna's leaving her beloved son after she gives birth to the daughter belonging to Vronsky: Karenin will care for the child. The climax comes with Anna's infamous suicide and the story ends with all loose ends tied.The exceptionally strong supporting cast includes such fine actors as Matthew Macfadyen, Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Ruth Wilson, Emily Watson, Michelle Dockery, and Shirley Henderson. The luxuriant costumes are by Jacqueline Durran, the cinematography is by Seamus McGarvey, and the glorious musical score is by Dario Marianelli. A Stunning Film. Grady Harp",Anna Karenina
16,zetes,"Beautiful to look at, and, once it gets going, emotionally potent",8,9 December 2012,"Oscar bait auteur Joe Wright takes a stab at the frequently adapted Tolstoy novel with pretty good results. The most notable element is the film's intended artificiality, setting it all up like it was an opera or play being filmed. The backgrounds are often the kinds of painted backgrounds you'd see on stage, and they're often lifted and moved, leaving the actors in the same spot while the scene changes. It's a curious gimmick, especially since the source material is a novel and not theatrical, but I thought it looked quite beautiful. I thought for a while that this stylization would take away from the story (which, I have to admit, I've generally found dull in earlier adaptations), but eventually I found myself drawn into the story (it should be noted that, as the story advances, Wright tones down the gimmick a bit, though the film looks ravishing throughout). Keira Knightley plays Anna and is very, very good. Even better is Jude Law as her husband. Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick-Ass, Albert Nobbs) is pretty good as Vronsky, though he seems like almost too big a prick for Anna to fall for in the first place. There are a lot of other fine performances, too, from Matthew Macfadyen, Kelly McDonald, Domhall Gleeson and gorgeous Swedish actress Alicia Vikander.",Anna Karenina
17,JamesHitchcock,Too Clever By Half,6,28 September 2012,"Tolstoy's novel ""Anna Karenina"" has been adapted for the cinema many times, although the only other version I have seen was that old Greta Garbo version from the 1930s. As with a number of other famous novels, the broad outlines of the plot are well-known even to many people who have not read the original book. A beautiful, vivacious young woman, unhappily married to a dull older man, begins an adulterous affair with a dashing young man, but fails to find happiness through adultery and ends up committing suicide. Actually, that could also be the plot of a number of other 19th century novels; my above synopsis would also fit Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"" (except that Emma Bovary had two lovers rather than one) and, with only a few changes, Theodor Fontane's ""Effi Briest"" and Leopoldo Alas's ""La Regenta"". It came as a shock to me to realise that the actor playing Alexei Karenin was none other than Jude Law, who in most of his earlier films- ""Road to Perdition"" being an exception- has played strikingly handsome young men. To see an actor once noted for his youthful good looks now cast as the dreary, physically unattractive, middle-aged husband of an unfaithful younger wife came as a powerful reminder of the passage of time. In fact, Law was probably the best of the three principal actors, making Karenin rather more sympathetic than in some interpretations. In this version Karenin is not a stony-hearted villain or religious hypocrite, merely the sort of respectably decent man who makes every woman yearn for an indecent one. Keira Knightley seems to specialise in period drama, but here she never brings to her role the charisma which she brought to a similar part in ""The Duchess"", and never really made Anna enough of a tragic figure. As for Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky, he seemed miscast and too young for the role. Vronsky, certainly, should be considerably younger than Karenin, but here he also seems considerably younger than Anna, less a sophisticated man of the world than a schoolboy desperately trying to grow his first moustache. I was much more impressed by Taylor- Johnson in the last film I saw him in, ""Nowhere Boy"" where he seemed very assured as the young John Lennon. (In those days he was still known as Aaron Johnson; he acquired his double barrel upon his marriage to the director of that film, Samantha Taylor-Wood. By rights, I suppose, he should have become Aaron Taylor-Wood-Johnson, but evidently thought that a triple-barrelled name was a bit over the top). Besides the main story of Anna, Karenin and Vronsky, the film also contains two subplots. One concerns Anna's brother Stiva Oblonsky, a man who has no more regard for the marriage vows than does his sister, but who is not punished in the same way. (One of Tolstoy's themes was the double standards applied by society to male and female adulterers). The second concerns the romance between the landowner Konstantin Levin and Kitty, the sister of Oblonsky's wife. Levin may technically be an aristocrat, but is really only a farmer, considerably less wealthy than the other main characters. Nevertheless, his is an attractively idealistic nature, and his marriage to Kitty is the only happy one in the novel. Matthew Macfadyen as Oblonsky seemed a bit too jovial; we never really sense that this is a man who has come close to destroying his family through his selfishness. I liked, however, Domhnall Gleeson (son of Brendan) as Levin, even though he was rather younger than the character I remember from the book. The film was directed by Joe Wright, who had earlier worked with Keira Knightley in two other period dramas, ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement"". Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it as much as either of those excellent films. Part of the reason was that Knightley, who was on top form in both those films, is rather disappointing here, but a lot has to do with the way in which Wright presents his material here. Many of the scenes are shot as though taking place on a stage, with obviously artificial scenery, and I just couldn't see the point of this gimmick. It is as though Wright, having signed up to make another costume drama, had decided that he didn't want to make just another costume drama and that he was going to be different merely for the sake of being different. Wright's eccentric direction, in fact, is something worse than merely a pointless gimmick. It seemed to me to waste a lot of the potential of Tolstoy's story. Had the director been adapting a stage play I could have understood his logic, but of course ""Anna Karenina"" is not a stage play. More than just a domestic tragedy, it is also a grand epic of Russian society in the late nineteenth century, and the film only fitfully captured this sense of epic grandeur, typically in those scenes, such as the ones set on Levin's estate, where Wright abandons his pseudo-theatrical style for a more traditional type of film-making. I have given the film an above-average mark, partly for some of the acting, partly for some of its other good points, such as the sumptuous costumes, but overall I felt it could have been much better had Wright not tried to be too clever by half. 6/10",Anna Karenina
18,lasttimeisaw,a typical miscast with all the froufrou,6,15 February 2014,"It's the third time for Jon Wright to tender Keira Knightley a leading role in a period drama, the first two (PRIDE & PREJUDICE 2005, 8/10; ATONEMENT 2007, 9/10) have raked in handsome rewards, but woefully the third time is not a charm, a plain and simple reason is that Knightley's screen reputation is a far cry from Anna Karenina, Tolstoy's prime epitome of a Russian belle, a married woman with a modernism perspective, who is enchanted by her dauntless quest of passion and dare to break out of the shackles of a dead-water marriage, yet consequentially, entrapped by her capricious psyche and finally corroded by the society's scorn and her overestimated perseverance of standing her ground. However, the film is a high-caliber colossus of mise en scène, deluxe costumes and outstanding art direction, particularly during the first act, its tableaux-on-stage suppleness can effortlessly dazzle the audience and preserve a spellbinding momentum while multifarious characters emerge and disappear, honing up to the climax, the resplendent ballroom sequences, introducing the lust-exuding pas de deux between Anna and Vronsky (Taylor-Johnson), concurrently, the subplot of Kitty (Vikander) and Levin (Gleeson) has been practically rolled out as well. Next, here comes the predestined adultery, which is fueled by the laborious emphasis on the enticement of the (not so inadvertent) eye contact, soon appears to be an over-contrived obligation to fornication other than following what your heart wants and the chemistry is purely physical, Anna and Vronsky should be soul-mate right? But here in this film, it is a Hollywood aggrandizement of a skinny beauty shagging a hot youngster who beams with pretended profundity (Taylor-Johnson was only 21, and not masculine enough to take on the role). So the magical momentum slumps, fortunately a little compensation is availed by Jude Law, whose version of Karenin is redolent of compassionate forbearance, elicits a free pardon to dissolve any blame generates from his side, occupies the moral higher ground, which skews our emotional pendulum and undermines Anna's character-building as an anachronistic woman who tragedy is mostly accredit to the time she is in instead of her own defect in making poor decisions. An involuntarily pouting Keira Knightley, treads the same water in THE DUCHESS (2008, 7/10), no wonder the aesthetic fatigue surges, so she can nail Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet, but not Anna Karenina, she is not that versatile as an actress. With Anna hogging the spotlight, the rest of the cast seldom has any chance to enrich their roles, Macfadyen (Knightley's Mr. Darcy in PRIDE & PREJUDICE) plays her luscious brother Oblonsky, adequately amps up some farcical digressions; as a mirrored romance between the rejected and the neglected (contrasts Anna and Vronsky's passion play), Gleeson and Vikander imbue the film with a modicum of subtlety but the wayward editing fail to make their story more engaging. So this adaption is a musically lyric venture for Joe Wright fans, it has its marked imperfections (thanks a lot, English is not my native tongue, otherwise I would find it is hard to take a Russian literature with mixed accents seriously), but the redundancy of his grandiose aesthetics, suggests Wright is a man knows what is his strongest suit, I can envisage him a successful comeback if only he can acquire some apposite fodder to prepare, maybe it will be his next project PAN, the origin story of Peter Pan, a wonderland backstory may fall right into his froufrou niche, meanwhile hire a new casting director is more contingent now.",Anna Karenina
19,Hellmant,Oscar bait at it's most atrocious!,4,20 February 2013,"'ANNA KARENINA': Two Stars (Out of Five) Melodrama at it's most exaggerated worst! Director Joe Wright once again teams with actress Keira Knightley (The two previously worked together on 2005's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' adaptation and 2007's 'ATONEMENT') for this adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel of the same name. The screenplay was adapted by Tom Stoppard (who also co-wrote much better films like Terry Gilliam's 'BRAZIL', Steven Spielberg's 'EMPIRE OF THE SUN' and John Madden's 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'). The film is set in 19th-century Russia and tells the story of a shameful affair between a wealthy socialite (Knightley) and a younger cavalry officer (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of 'KICK-ASS' fame). The movie is pretty bad on almost every level but it's one saving grace is Wright's beautiful 'style over substance' directing.The film starts with one affair (in 1874 Imperial Russia), between Prince Stepan ""Stiva"" Oblonsky (Matthew Mcfadyen) and the governess of his five kids, and leads to another. Stiva's sister Anna Karenina (Knightley) travels to Moscow to try to convince her brother's wife, Dolly (Kelly Macdonald), to forgive him. Anna is married to a Russian statesman, Alexi (Jude Law), and together they have a son. Anna is successful at getting her sister-in-law to forgive her brother but then she falls madly in love with Count Alexi Vronsky (Taylor-Johnson), who she just met. This upsets her brother's sister-in-law Kitty (Alicia Vikander), who was hoping to marry the Count, and of course causes troubles for herself at home with her husband. Anna and Count Vronsky begin a passionate affair anyway, not caring how it effects those around them.The film is Oscar bait at it's most atrocious. It was nominated for four technical awards (including music, cinematography, production design and costume design), which is a shame because there are much more deserving films out there (in all of those categories). This film is so over-the-top in it's ridiculously bad melodrama that it's painful to watch at times. Knightley (like she often does) overacts the hell out of her role and the rest of the cast is adequate at best. The women in the film are still pretty to look at (especially Alicia Vikander) and the film is filled with other stunning visuals. Like I said Wright's directing is beautiful and is often amusing to watch but this story (at least the way it's portrayed here) is pathetic. I liked he and Knigtley's other work together better and I really liked Wright's last two films ('HANNA' and 'THE SOLOIST'). This film is just awful though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",Anna Karenina
20,dromasca,Anna Karenina like you've never seen,8,30 March 2013,"What else can be said about Anna Karenina, one of the books that were read, brought to stage and screen so many times? We think that we know the action and the characters, and it takes quite an amount of courage for the director and the team who undertakes a new staging or film based upon Tolstoy's novel to believe that new things can be said and a fresh perspective created, and quite an amount of talent to make it happen. This is the challenge that script author Tom Stoppard and director Joe Wright decided to take upon with making a 21st century version of Anna Karenina and to a large extent I believe that they succeeded.Maybe I should not be that surprised with Joe Wright. Atonement (also staring Keira Knightley) which I liked a lot had the patient building of the characters and an exquisite capability of melding into the period it dealt with and bringing it to screen. I liked less The Soloist but maybe that was the exception. The idea in this version of Anna Karenina is to transpose literally to screen the concept that 'the world is a stage'. The story takes place in the world of the aristocracy and high bureaucracy of the last decades of the Russian empire. We all know the history of the crumbling of that empire where the few ruled over a world of misery and suffering they chose to ignore, a world that will soon take revenge. Instead of investing into recreating realistic or naturalistic imagery of that world, Wright and Stoppard create a theater, one of these fabulous theater houses that were raised in the 19th century Europe, and makes the whole action a play with windows opening to a reality that also is more idealized as in the neo-classical paintings of the period. It's a daring concept, it takes a few minutes to get used and accept it, but then the action starts to flow and as a view you can focus on the characters - and there is enough novelty here as well for the whole film to be interesting. At some point the concept reminded me Scorsese's Hugo, especially as trains and railway stations play a special role in Tolstoy's novels. but Wright stops a step behind in creating such a complex and wonderful world as Scorsese's Paris or maybe he is just not Scorsese (yet?).I was not especially thrilled by Keira Knightley's performance, and if I am to add the fade performance of Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky, I would say that the two make an uninspired pair of lovers. Luckily they are the only uninspired choice in this film, as Jude Law gives life and a new perspective to Karenin's character, Domhall Gleeson shows that there is life after Harry Potter, and together with Alicia Vikander make the lovable pair of this version (as Levin and Kitty). (Vikander is a star in becoming, I loved her acting also in A Royal Affair). At the end they add the dose of emotion everybody seeks in such screenings to declare them successful, which is added to the interesting conception and the fresh perspective on some of the characters in order to make of this Anna Karenina not only a visually beautiful version of the story, but also a film to watch for a few more good reasons.",Anna Karenina
21,ericstevenson,It looks really nice,8,13 February 2017,"I remember first hearing a magazine say the original ""Anna Karenina"" book was voted the greatest novel of all time! I didn't even think it was the best one made by Leo Tolstoy! I was very eager to see this movie version if only because I wanted to know the story of what was considered to be the greatest novel of all time. I guess I should have read the book first. I feel bad for not being familiar with such a beloved story. The story is pretty basic with a woman named Anna Karenina having an affair and even an illegitimate son. Yeah, that's pretty much the whole plot.I felt the length of this movie was quite nice. I was afraid it would go on forever seeing as how it was made by the same guy who wrote ""War And Peace"". I do wish that I could compare the original novel because I don't know how faithfully it adapted the story. For an unbiased opinion, I found this to be a good movie. The best thing about it is probably how great the sets are. Everything is just so wonderfully bright and colorful here. This really does give you the feeling of Russia in the 1800's. It's great as a period piece, albeit an unintentional one. ***",Anna Karenina
22,inkblot11,"So beautiful, so tragic, well worth seeing soon",8,9 August 2013,"In pre-revolution Russia, the rich try to make matches among themselves. Thus, Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) was married off at eighteen to Mr. Karenin, a much admired and wealthy philanthropist. Yet, although she is very attached to their only child, a son, the union is not a happy one. Karenin is a cold fish of a person, never having heard the phrase ""charity begins at home"". So, as the world thinks him a most admirable gentleman, he is barely civil and never affectionate to his young, beautiful wife. One day, Anna, who resides in St. Petersburg, is summoned to Moscow for a crisis in her brother Oblonsky's house. This charming but careless man (Matthew Macfadyen) has been caught cheating AGAIN, this time with the governess. His wife Dolly, herself the mother of many children, is beside herself with grief and betrayal. Anna persuades her sister-in-law that Oblonsky does indeed love her. The two reconcile and the world, accepting his infidelity, forgives. While in Moscow, Anna attends a ball, where Princess Kitty, a very lovely younger sister of Dolly, is about to choose a husband. A man named Levin (Domhnall Glesson) asks first, for he is much in love, despite being a country landowner who likes it rustic. But, alas, Kitty is blinded by the conniving charms of Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and is waiting for this man's proposal. Levin, stung, soon returns to his home. Poor, poor Kitty is the mantra to come. Vronsky spies Anna and even though he knows she is married to another, he pursues her hotly. At first, Anna rejects him decidedly, although secretly she is glad to be admired. But, Vronsky follows her back to St. P and continues his chase. Karenin, hearing gossip, warns Anna frostily about the costs of adultery, including estrangement from her beloved son. Yet, this criticism only makes Anna resolved to accept Vronsky's attentions. Soon, Anna is overwhelmed with a relationship that is passionate and exciting, very unlike her marriage. Yet, in contrast to society's acceptance of her brother Oblonsky's unfaithfulness, Anna is shunned by her former circle of relatives and friends. Vronsky, too, shows a mean streak when he acquires a white racehorse, enters a competition, and promptly rides badly, breaking the horse's back. But, instead of cuddling the animal, he beats it until someone stops him. What a look into his inner self! Thus, with Anna separated from everyone, including her precious son, is there a way to lasting happiness? Ditto, for the lovely Kitty, who longs to be married? Thie beautiful and tragic film brings Tolstoy's classic novel to the screen, with ambition and skill. Its introductory technique is to place the tale as a theater production, with the initial players on stage. This is continued at intervals, but at other times, the story unfolds as a typical movie. The director, Joe Wright, could be both lauded and faulted for such a risky move. It doesn't quite work, my opinion, but is not a huge distraction. All of the actors are wonderful, with Knightley bringing her all to Anna's lovely but conflicted character. Naturally, it is very clear that women, at this historic period, are treated unfairly in the court of public opinion and the church. But, that's the way it was. The sets and costumes are to die for, sumptuous and dazzling. The pace, too, seems quite fine, as is the juxtaposition between the doomed love of Anna and Vronsky and the eventual happiness of Kitty and Levin. Dear film fans, don't miss out on this vibrant, interesting but sad movie. It should be one the ""must-see"" list for the coming year.",Anna Karenina

Meanwhile, Anna's brother (Matthew Macfadyen) plays matchmaker to Kitty and his friend (Domhnall Gleeson).A theatrical play within a film, the kaleidoscopic scenery in this adaptation of Tolstoy's tome is rewarding enough to overlook its tedious sub-plot and amoral leads.Besides, separation in Russia means your ex can still fly drones over your airspace.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",Anna Karenina
24,kenjha,Idiots at Work,2,8 June 2013,"The classic Tolstoy novel is turned into...well, it's not clear what exactly this is meant to be. The filmmakers are apparently trying to be clever and unconventional, but sometimes it's better to follow convention. Director Wright had great success with ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement,"" both featuring Knightley, but he seems to be totally lost here, unable to overcome the inept screenplay by Stoppard. While much of the film is conventionally shot, at times the camera moves back to reveal that the action is not taking place in 19th century Russia but on a stage. Shakespeare did say, ""All the world's a stage."" He also said, ""Life is a tale told by an idiot,"" and he was looking at the filmmakers of this travesty when he said it.",Anna Karenina
25,sol-,Torn,6,28 April 2017,"Leo Tolstoy's story of a Russian woman torn between a passionate extramarital lover and her comfortable life in a loveless marriage is interestingly turned into a filmed stage play here. If an odd artistic decision, it gives a nice, dreamlike quality to the material as the camera glides, floats and creeps about as the actors walk around stage to change set and location. Dario Marianelli's lively music score also often enlivens the film beyond the stage-bound setting and as workmen move up and down in synchrony, the film almost has the choreography of a big budget musical. No amount of audiovisual pizazz can, however, disguise how melodramatic the tale is in director Joe Wright's hands. The casting of Keira Knightley does not help either as she does little to render her character sympathetic and while Jude Law's subdued approach to playing her husband initially seems like a stroke of genius, his eliciting of few emotions after everything Knightley puts him through never quite feels right. In short, Anna feels less a victim of a repressive society and more of a victim of her own instability and an uncaring husband. As mentioned, the film looks and sounds magnificent enough that the potency of the story is not quite so important, but it is hard not to wonder what may have been here with more attention to characters/performance and less attention to audiovisual splendour.",Anna Karenina
26,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Despite its strange proposition finally a good version, more positive than all the previous attempts",8,2 April 2013,"""Anna Karenina"" is a case of love or hate. No, I'm not talking about this movie, but I'm referring to Tolstoy's story and some of its many film versions out there. I haven't read the novel and don't plan to. However, I'm deeply familiar with the story after seeing three versions (this is the fourth time) of it. In two occasions I wasn't involved at all (Greta Garbo's version is one of those), found it a tired melodramatic piece that always seems to exhaust its viewers. The third remake, an almost unknown flick starring Jacqueline Bisset and Christopher Reeve was the one I enjoyed the most, when I finally understood its complexities and meanders but still haven't appeal to me to one day I read the novel. Joe Wright's new update is the one I consider to be definitive, risky and the most exciting of all, and the one in which brought innovations absent in the other retellings, and what's more shocking, things that were in Tolstoy work but Hollywood overlooked or ignored to present.The tricky quicksand of this film is the way Wright decides to conduct a classical story. Everything is told as if it were a stage play with the scenery changing from one place to another through long takes, unusual camera movements and plans. One minute we're ready to see a play being staged, then one of the actors walks out and he talks to one of the main characters. We're not in a play, but we feel that we are. It is strange to explain just as much it is strange and difficult to understand what Wright is doing when you're watching it for the first minutes. You get used to it after a while. With that, he proves that a period film doesn't need to spend much to create sceneries, buildings and recreating old architectures as long as you 1) film on a stage like Fellini used to do in Cinecittá (which is a whole city) and 2) focus more on interior scenes than exterior ones, in order to not build many things. 3) and always use some CGI to compose and intersect the shots. With those, the director wants to install a sense of a vague, false world and false emotions, as if everything wasn't authentic, just like the character's emotions are presented in here. They live as if they were in a play therefore the director presents like if it was a play. Many were bothered with such peculiar presentation but it works in a way.Just a detail given by my detailed eye. The story is the same as usual: Anna (Keira Knightley) is happily married with the powerful Karenin (Jude Law), everything seems to be perfect until the day she mets with Count Vronsky (Aaron Johnson) and both fall madly in love with each other, causing an enormous scandal in the Russian society. It's sad, so sad, it's a sad sad situation. Perhaps that's why it always failed in reach my attention every time I watched the other versions. Wright's instance caught my interest when he included a more positive interlude ignored by all the other adaptations: here we have the chance to follow Levin a hard laborer worker (Domhall Gleeson) trying to find his way to happiness and love. He used to have possession, was wealthy but gave up of everything after a non-corresponded love (a girl who was interested in Vronsky). It seems pointless to the story but it's not. Tolstoy/Wright are using such device to make a deep and valuable parallel between him and Anna Karenina and the way both form their conceptions of what love is, and it shows that material goods, richness aren't all that matters. Anna suffers with all the wealthy surrounding her, same goes to Karenin, while Levin discovers the simplicity of working in the fields much like Tolstoy used to preach in his final years.This ""Anna Karenina"" is nothing less than an old story wrapped in a new package, purely modern (Vronsky and Anna wild french-kiss in the park, quite a surprise), a little affectionate but just like the others it drags down a lot when it comes to its dramatic consequences, Anna's battle while trying to visit her child and the ultimate fate of all characters. For the first time ever I really felt sympathy towards Karenin, this time refusing to be a villain but frankly a man who is doing what he needs to save himself from shame, from being made of ridiculous fool in a front of hypocritical society. You can feel that he still loves Anna but he can't go on with the marriage anymore. All the other actors who played the role made him look as a bad guy. Law doesn't, and I really enjoyed this real dimension he brought to the character. He was brilliant while playing such a ungrateful role. Knightley and Johnson spark some sexual flames but not the love needed, it's more like they're attracted to each other and that's it (as strange as it might sound, I mean, trading a man for a boy?). It's never love. You care about them but not as much as the other powerful couples on another Wright's films ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"".If the inventive art-direction might bother some who expect to see epic sets and locations, the costume designs made by Jacqueline West can't be reprehended one bit. It deserved all the awards it got, suitable and symbolic compositions that brought the class and richness of period movies, almost in extinction these days. Really stunning. Here's a good proof that remakes and retellings are possible and interesting to grab new audiences. In my case, I'm really glad they did it right this time, I enjoyed it. It's not perfect but it's way better than all the other attempts I had the opportunity to see. 8/10",Anna Karenina
27,filipemanuelneto,Sometimes it shows quality but it didn't convince me.,4,22 January 2020,"""Anna Karenina"" is one of the classics of Russian literature. Written by Tolstoi, it is a truly colossal book, with long descriptions that details the mood of the characters. It is a very rich and complex book, with intense dialogues and some moments when the characters debate the state of the empire, moments where the author, apart from the story he wrote, inserted a hint of social and political criticism. Thus, it is a difficult book to transpose to the cinema. Something is always lost. It's not even worth comparing because we already know that.In this film, the forbidden and sweeping romance of Anna, a woman trapped in a routine and conventional marriage, and Vronsky, the military officer who wants to live life as if each day were the last, has been fully transposed onto a stage, as if the entire Russian court society were a gigantic theater stage where everyone plays a role. The metaphor is not irrelevant. In this film, the importance of the social role stands out. For people like Anna or her husband, the opinion of others counts and affects the way they play their role on the ""stage"" of Russian society. Ana, Vronsky, Minister Alexei, each of them is just as or more concerned with the social implications of what is happening than with the events themselves.Despite this, and although the film respects the essentials of the original book, it is quite weak. Joe Wright looks like a weak director, who takes a sugary romance, sweetens it even more and puts the audience to sleep by telling it... very... slowly... and without any emotion. To make matters worse, he was so excited to make a stylish movie with those theatrical artifices, visual effects and out of the box camera angles that he neglected everything else. The film is very slow without any reason, the story has no depth and is told almost in a gossipy tone. Some scenes are so stylized that a lot of their meaning is lost. For example, the ball scene at the Scherbatsky's palace, where we don't see Anna excited about the success she is making in Moscow society, and where Kitty's anger is justified by Vronsky's attitudes without taking into account the fact that the young girl, on her debut, was virtually overshadowed by another woman, older and already married!It remains for me to speak of the actors. In one hand, I liked the performance of Jude Law, who gave us a very dignified, impassive and serious Minister Alexei. Matthew Macfadyen (who played Anna's brother, Stiva) and Domhnall Gleeson, who gave life to a rude but important Kostia Levin, are also great. But Aaron Taylor-Johnson never convinced me as Vronsky and Keira Knightley just don't have any chemistry with him.Technically, the film is interesting. Special, visual and sound effects are good, the green screen and CGI were used and abused, there are some moments of tension, but are accidentally attenuated by the soundtrack, which has quality but is sometimes too much loud and shrill. A word yet for the excellent quality of the costumes and sets.",Anna Karenina

29,howard.schumann,Passionless and uninvolving,6,2 February 2013,"Along with many great writers including Balzac, Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, and Turgenev, Russian author Leo Tosltoy has a reputation for realist fiction, an attention to the mundane, to the experiences of every day life as opposed to a highly stylized or romantic approach. This realist approach is disregarded, however, by director Joe Wright's flamboyant and glitzy re-imagining of Tolstoy's epic novel Anna Karenina. It is the eleventh such version of this novel on film and one that adds little to our understanding or appreciation of this great work. Contrary to Tolstoy's literary realism, the production is marked by heavily choreographed movements and theatrical accoutrements such as painted background sets and whirling bodies, all played out on a stage in an ornate but decaying theater, a vague metaphor for the growing rottenness of the aristocracy. Although locations are changed through altering the backgrounds, the device serves to reinforce the unreal nature of what we are seeing and distances us from the emotions of the unfolding story. Set in Russia in the late 1800s, Anna Karenina, portrayed by British actress Keira Knightley, is the wife of Karenin (Jude Law), a rigid and humorless Tsarist government official. As Anna leaves on the night train for Moscow as a result of a crisis in her brother Oblonsky's (Matthew Macfadyen) marriage to Dolly (Kelly Macdonald), she meets Countess Vronsky (Olivia Williams) and her son, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a young cavalry officer. The chance meeting of Anna and Vronsky leads to a relationship that threatens her marriage with Karenin and results in her being isolated and ostracized from aristocratic society. Vronsky's movements in Russian society, however, have no such restrictions. A parallel story, prominent in the novel, but deemphasized in the film, is that of wealthy landowner Levin's (Domhnall Gleeson) pursuit of Dolly's sister Kitty (Alicia Vikander). This relationship, grounded in simplicity and mutual support, stands in contrast to the messy liaisons of the upper classes. A highlight of the film is the charming scene in which Levin woos Kitty after her initial rejection by communicating with her through the movement of block letters on a table. While Anna has made mistakes of judgment, she has acted according to her own heart and to her privilege as a woman, but this aspect is underplayed in the film.Rather, her emotional deterioration is depicted as based mainly on her weaknesses - her inability to handle the rejection of her husband, her doubts about Vronsky's commitment, and her dismay at being shunned by her own social class. While the basic outline of Tolstoy's novel is present, the overriding message is buried beneath a stagy presentation and the wooden performances of painfully miscast actors. Indeed, Anna Karenina is more about infidelity than about the crumbling of the old order, a breakdown that would eventually lead to revolution. After he returned from the army and witnessed how the military was used to suppress the peasants demands for better conditions, Tolstoy became moved by a sense of social justice and a feeling of disgust at his own connection to the privileged elite, but, even though the aristocrats are depicted as hypocritical and often mean-spirited, very little of this social conscience is seen in the film. As a result, a powerful tragedy becomes passionless and uninvolving, and the breadth and depth of a great literary work of art is reduced to artifice.",Anna Karenina
30,l_rawjalaurence,Elegant and Boring Misfire,4,18 April 2014,"The ingredients for this fourth adaptation of Tolstoy's classic look promising on paper: Joe Wright and Keira Knightley reunite after their success with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (2005), with a screenplay written by Tom Stoppard. The conception behind the film is a suggestive one: the entire action is located in a giant theater, with the protagonists conceived as performers putting on roles for the audience's benefit. This should have provided a framework for an analysis of Anna's (Knightley's) motivations, as she abandons her husband (Jude Law) in favor of her lover (Aaron Taylor-Johnston), even though by doing so she condemns herself to a lifetime of social ostracism. It's perhaps more important for her to follow her inclinations rather than conform to pre-determined social roles. Unfortunately the finished product turns out a disappointment: director Wright seems to have little idea how to develop the screenplay, other than to indulge in a series of consciously 'artificial' shots - for example, zooming into the characters' faces, or using a deliberately jagged narrative style - that render the action difficult to follow. In the central role Knightley seems miscast; she lacks both poise and grace - essential to portraying a Russian aristocrat - and she tends to gabble her lines. Taylor-Johnston's Vronsky is easily the worst I have seen in any of the four versions of the tale - surpassing Kieron Moore in Korda's woebegone 1948 adaptation. Not only does he lack any sense of nobility, but he does not seem to know what to do with the part: we are left wondering precisely why Anna should have wanted to fall in love with him. Jude Law's Karenin is perhaps the only reason for watching this film; a quiet, yet menacing personality who seldom loses his cool, yet remaining determined to control his wife (and hence maintain a facade of social respectability) at any costs. Trapped within this kind of marriage, we can understand precisely why Anna should want to take her own life. The film's group sequences are competently handled, although the choreography could have been improved. What this ANNA KARENINA shows is that even attaching the biggest names in theater to a project cannot guarantee its overall quality.",Anna Karenina
31,Vartiainen,Average film adaptation with a nifty art style,3,28 April 2013,"I've yet to read the book this film is based on, so this review is purely about a standalone film. And honestly, I've seen worse. From what I've gathered the critics mainly blame this film for not being a very good adaptation, but then again the book is one of the most well-respected books in modern history, so is it really no wonder that it takes some doing to adapt it correctly.But as stated, this is not a bad film, not really. It's a bit too fast-paced, some plot elements are not properly set up, most of the side characters are a bit bland and it has some other minor problems here and there, but the main elements of it do work. Keira Knightley is very believable in her role as Anna Karenina, playing her as both vulnerable and mature. I don't usually like her archetype in stories, but Knightley's performances made it seem both believable and perhaps even the slightest bit understandable. This was helped by a great performance from Jude Law as Karenin, Anna's cold and distant husband. Law's performance was easily the best in the film as he had to convey a lot of emotions and themes with a very stoic character, which he did admirably. The rest of the main characters weren't bad either, though none of them really stood out. This was painfully obvious in the case of Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who played the role of Count Vronsky. This should have been the most intriguing character of them all, the one with the most charisma. Unfortunately Taylor-Johnson merely looks good on camera, but doesn't have much of a presence.On the technical side of things, it's a nicely shot film. The decision to have most of the scenes happen in a theater was an interesting one. It gives the film its own unique flair, but is also a bit distracting in certain scenes. On the other hand sometimes it also adds that something to certain scenes where you go ""oh yeah, this is same room, but set differently and from a different angle"". Other technical elements are also quite solid and the film looks good so no complaints there.In the end this is an average film. It has some good role performances and interesting art decisions, but the average side characters and the fast pace of the plot keep it from being anything else than a pleasant diversion for one evening. If historical costume pieces are your thing, check it out. If you're madly in love with the original book and want to see it done justice, this probably isn't your film.",Anna Karenina
32,freemantle_uk,A visually extravagant costume-drama,9,25 November 2012,"Joe Wright has made a reputation for himself as one of the best costume drama directors around, making Pride and Prejudice and Atonement. With his latest film, an adaptation of Anna Karenina, he sets out to give us one of the most ambitious and surreal costume dramas in a long time, breaking the conventions of the genre with its unusual setting and visual approach.Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) is a Russian aristocrat in the 1870s. She is married to Alexi Karenin (Jude Law), a quietly spoken senior government official seen as a saint in all of Russia. Yet Anna is ready to sacrifice her position, status and her son when she embarks on affair with a young and up-and-coming cavalry officer, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), causing a scandal that engulfs the Russian aristocracy.The most obvious comparison that can be made for Anna Karenina is to Laurence Olivier's 1944 version of Henry V. Both movies start in a theatre setting, slowly entering into a more real-world setting and again bookended by the theatre setting. While Henry V was told as if to an audience watching a play, Anna Karenina is literally set in a theatre.Early on in the movie, Wright uses the theatre setting to great effect, allowing for a quick pace at the beginning and cutting time as the film scenery moves around the characters. Wright embraces the theatrical nature of this adaptation, using theatrical devices to emphasise dramatic moments and allowing us to know the thoughts of characters without the need for voiceovers.Visually, one of the most glorious moments in Anna Karenina is a five-minute dance sequence between Anna and Vronsky as the camera tracks them and everyone around them is either still or moving slowly. It highlights the sexual tension between the two and the humiliation Princess Kitty (Alicia Vikander) suffered as a result. This sequence serves as a master class of filmmaking because not a single word of dialogue was used or needed.As the movie turns into a more traditional costume drama, however, it slows and drags. This slower pace, really taking its time to get to the major story elements, makes Anna Karenina feel like it is longer than it really is (never an endearing quality of a motion picture). It needed tighter editing just to trim some of the fat in the middle of the film.Those who enjoy costume drama and historical pieces are in for a treat; there are plenty of themes of love and sacrifice as Anna and Vronsky are prepared to lose their status and opportunities and become pariahs with their social class. The other major theme was an examination of the hypocrisy of this society, that if a man has an affair it is acceptable, but for a woman would be social suicide. A woman would even loose face if they leave their husband who is having an affair. Despite Anna Karenina being based on a famous novel many elements of Anna's relationships played very similarly to another Knightley costume drama, The Duchess.All will find Anna Karenina to be an ambitious experiment and unconventional costume drama, a striking movie with moments that offer great examples of what a filmmaker can achieve visually. It is a fantastic blend of film and theatre and shows how theatrical techniques can be incorporated into film. Wright is a very talented director with a fantastic eye and gets great performances out of his actors. Anna Karenina is tragic, but rewarding movie for its ambition.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",Anna Karenina
33,dfranzen70,I wanted to like someone..,5,3 November 2012,"If you enjoy period pieces based on classical literature, then Anna Karenina just might be your cup of pinky-extending tea. It has all of the requisite elements of lavish costumes, true love, love for money, love of money, and true lust. It is easy to see how anyone who's a fan of this kind of movie would enjoy Anna Karenina. I am not one of those people.All right, so we have established I'm not big on period pieces. But I did like Dangerous Liaisons, which is about all of the above, plus murder. I admire fine costumery. I like complicated sets depicting a long-ago time. But why didn't I like Anna Karenina? Well, it probably has to do with the source material.To begin with, I have never read Tolstoy's novel of the same name, and I don't plan to. It is possible that the book is much more detailed and colorful and that it is infinitely better than director Joe Wright's cinematic vision. But because reading the book isn't a requisite for watching a movie, this shouldn't count against me. I had the general idea of the plot, and off we went.Anna (Keira Knightley) is the wife of a Russian bureaucrat, Alexei Karenin (Jude Law). But then Anna notices/is noticed by a certain Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is in the middle of wooing another member of the nobility, Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Soon Vronsky is pursuing Anna, who rebuffs him at first but soon enough can't control her emotions.At first blush, this may seem like a classic love triangle, only Alexei is of such fine character that although he disapproves of his wife's infidelity, he refuses to make a fuss about it - at least until other people begin to notice and Anna and Vronsky begin to make spectacles of themselves. This is mainly because Alexei realizes full well that his is a loveless marriage to Anna, and her happiness is not a bad thing - so long as it does not have a strong negative impact on his standing among Russia's elite. As the characters bounce from unrequited love to mutual lust and back again, I wondered for whom I should root. Surely one of them was a good person at heart and simply had bad things happen to them. Or perhaps they simply made bad choices - nothing wrong with that! We've all made bad choices, whether it's attending community college for more than two years or buying a Zune. We each have our past demons to slay.Then I watched the characters' lives unfold. Anna does a lot of things wrong and makes plenty of mistakes. But she does so knowingly, intending to cause harm to make herself feel good. This is not a good character! This is a selfish human being. Almost nothing Anna does throughout the movie is to help anyone but Anna. She is willing not only to stray from her marriage (which affords her all sorts of perks as a member of Russian nobility) but to flaunt it in front of her well-meaning husband. Did I mention they have a son together? None of this matters too much to Anna. Then there's Vronsky. From the very beginning he flits from woman to woman. He doesn't kiss them or more; that'd be too racy for this movie. No, he pitches woo and, worse, makes women think he's into them. Sure, that more or less makes him like most of his gender. But even after he begins messing around with the married Anna, he flirts with others and generally acts like a giant cad. True love? Anna and Vronsky don't have true love. Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kitty, do - although perhaps they don't know it yet. Their story arc is infinitely more interesting and sympathetic than that of Vronsky and Anna could ever hope to be.This is not to say that the movie is a lost cause. It's expertly directed by Wright, who uses a stage motif throughout the picture. That is, characters move from scene to scene, in some cases, when set pieces are moved away from them, and many of the scenes themselves take place at plays or other public recitals. It's really a quite clever way of moving the story along. In fact, the story is fast paced, dissimilar to most period costume pieces.Knightley and Johnson are well cast, but for my money they were outacted by Gleeson, Vikander (also in A Royal Affair), Emily Watson (as Countess Lydia), Matthew Macfayden (as Prince Oblonsky), and Law as Karenin, in a wonderfully understated performance. Here's an interesting caveat, too - it's rated R in the United States, but right now I can't recall why. There's no profanity, and even the sex scenes are pretty antiseptic and quite brief. Someone somewhere must have seen something they didn't like.In all, this adaptation of Anna Karenina isn't dull, but when it reaches for something to set it apart from other versions - and, by extension, other costume period pieces - it overreaches. When your main characters are essentially unseemly and self-serving, you need to compensate by doing something different. Wright does, in his sharp direction and the choice to use the theater as a backdrop, but it's simply not enough to obscure the fact that no one in this movie, save Levin and Kitty and perhaps Alexsei himself, is worth worrying about.",Anna Karenina
34,runamokprods,"Brave, odd, not always successful, but worth seeing",8,15 September 2014,"A brave experiment that doesn't always work, but succeeds in letting us see Tolstoy's great, oft filmed novel in a new light. Setting much of the film in an aging theater, director Joe Wright and screen writer Tom Stoppard accomplish two things. They make literal the reality that in the 19th century upper class life was a play, and your survival depended on playing your role just right. It sounds heavy handed, and at times it feels it, but it brought out a humor and a pathos for all involved that I found fresh and rewarding. In the same vein, the film isn't afraid to make Anna look self involved, and actually makes Jude Law, doing some of his best work as Anna's boring, uptight and pious husband, arguably the most sympathetic character, The film refuses to give Anna and her lover a 'get out of jail emotionally free' card. Yes, we want them to be together, we see their passion, but we also see the real-world consequences of their obsessive love. Contrasted with that is Levin, an idealist landowner who loves in a quieter, but also more honest and sustainable way than Anna's passion -- and we are left feeling confused about just what is right and wrong when dealing with love and society. The film looks amazing. Wright uses his theatrical conceit beautifully, then breaks it at just the right time to make the point that not everyone, especially the proto-Marxist Levin are about living on that stage, but try to experience real life. The results may be at odd with some of Tolstoy's ideas, and certainly are different than we've seen before, but what's an classic, done many times, for except to reexamine. At times the theatrical effects can be distracting, and the approach causes a certain emotional distance. Sometimes this feels more like the social satire of Chekhov, than the deeply felt prose of Tolstoy, and it can get slow and repetitive in spots. But most of the time I was grateful to be surprised at seeing the story in a new way.",Anna Karenina
35,estebangonzalez10,Wright and Knightley reunite for a third time,7,1 February 2013,"¨Anna isn't a criminal, but she broke the rules! ¨After the success Joe Wright had last year with his thriller Hannah, he now returns to doing what made him famous: adapting well known romantic period pieces. His collaboration with Keira Knightley in Pride and Prejudice put him in the map. They teamed up again for Atonement with equal success, and now they got together for the third time for the adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's famous novel. They say that the third time is the charm, but I found this to be their weakest collaboration together despite its four Oscar nominations (Cinematography, Costume Design, Original Score, and Production Design). Wright has had success in the past with these period pieces always receiving nominations for his work in the technical department. This film is a triumph visually with a great production and costume design representing 19th century Imperialistic Russia. The performances are pretty much alright but no one really stands out here. The film is shot in an experimental way as the narrative seems to be taking place in a theater where actors come in and out of different sets through the stage. It strikes you odd at first, but later you get used to this approach which in a way works because the characters in this story are viewed through a lens in society in a similar way as we view actors performing plays on stage. It was an interesting and original way to make the film in my opinion, but I don't know if it worked for everyone. The main issue I had with this film is that it was so focused on the beautiful exterior designs that the narrative and characters seemed to lack depth and humanity. Several issues were left out of Tolstoy's novel, but it's understandable considering Wright put more emphasis on the relationships than on socio- political ideologies. The story is set in Imperialistic Russia during the late 19th century focusing on aristocratic families. Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley), an aristocrat who is married to a senior government official named Alexei Karenin (Jude Law) who is twenty years older than her, decides to travel from St. Petersburg to Moscow to visit her brother, Stiva (Matthew MacFadyen) and convince his wife Dolly (Kelly Macdonald) to forgive him for being unfaithful to her in order to calm the turmoil that his affair stirred up in Moscow society. Stiva is a womanizer, but Anna convinces Dolly to forgive him and stay with him. Dolly's beautiful sister, Princess Kitty (Alicia Vikander), invites Anna to a ball where she expects Vronsky (Aaron Johnson), a cavalry officer to propose to her. In the meantime a childhood friend of Stiva's, Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) a passionate but shy landowner who lives in the country, has come to propose to Kitty as well. Kitty is in love with Vronsky so she politely refuses to marry Levin and he returns to the countryside. During the ball, Vronsky and Anna seem to instantly feel attracted towards each other and Vronsky completely ignores Kitty by choosing Anna as his dance partner instead of her. This is when Kitty realizes that Vronsky has never been in love with her, and Anna having such a strong attraction for Vronsky decides to return home to her husband and son before more damage is done. This is just the beginning for Anna's moral troubles as, Vronsky takes the same train back to Petersburg and confesses his love to her. The two soon share a passionate affair, which Russian society will not forgive.It must be hard to adapt what is considered to be one of the best novels of all time into a screenplay; and that difficult task was left to Tom Stoppard (Shakespeare in Love). I think that several elements from the novel didn't translate very well, especially if the viewer wasn't familiar with the novel. However the story is still so rich and powerful that the film works, although the characters don't have enough depth as in the novel. Despite the difficulty in adapting the novel I feel the movie did succeed in some ways and makes this film worth the watch. Fans of period pieces will be delighted with the exquisite attention to the costume and production designs. They will also fall for this love affair, a story that has transcended time and space. Despite living in a very different society now, I feel that through paparazzi and gossip magazines we still kind of remain obsessed and judgmental towards Hollywood stars private lives in a similar way as ancient societies gossiped about aristocratic life. I do have to admit that as beautiful as the film might look, it does feel like it is missing a beat to it and will leave you a bit indifferent towards the end.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Anna Karenina

No real complaints about the acting, many of the sets were stunning, some of the photography exquisite. But it was all killed for me by the weird theatrical framing device. It was bizarre and distracting. I get that they wanted to a somewhat fresh take on an old novel that has been adapted to film dozens of times. But made the movie go off the rails, pun intended. And I think Vronsky was miscast as a frivolous fop. It's not terrible, so see it if you like, but the one with Greta Garbo playing Anna was much better.",Anna Karenina

I adore the format of making the theatre the core of the story.I think director Joe Wright and writer Tom Stoppard are using this great Tolstoy novel to show how the upper classes are always the talk and interest of their own class and the working classes. Thus the constant return to the theatre. Since the stage is the recurring core of this movie the theatre represents the life of those rich and famous - their lives are always more interesting because it happens in grand settings. No one is interested in the lives of the poor and obscure. Not even themselves! When we see the poor they are dark and soiled but the wealthy are bright and in fancy clothes. We see it throughout history right up to he present.The Anna Karenina story is so universal it fits all times. But when the Anna is rich and holds a high social position everybody looks - just as if she were on stage.A perfectly beautiful movie, a treat for the eyes and mind!",Anna Karenina
38,3xHCCH,All Embellishment More Than Substance,6,24 February 2013,"""Anna Karenina"" is a classic in Russian literature by Leo Tolstoi. I only know the basic story about a married Russian aristocrat and her passionate and ill-fated affair with a younger count. I generally do not like stories that deal with adultery. But this one is based on a famous novel which I have not yet read, and this film had multiple Oscar nominations, so I wanted to see how this film directed by Joe Wright will tell the story.This version of ""Anna Karenina"" is a beautifully-filmed, technically- polished production. All the technical aspects are practically perfect! The cinematography was breath-taking. The editing was exciting. The production design was impeccable. The music was effectively moving. Joe Wright's idea of setting the story to unfold on a stage was artistic, imaginative and inspired. I believe what held this film from being the best it could be was the cast. I know Keira Knightley is a Joe Wright favorite. She had been in his two most famous films, ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005) and ""Atonement"" (2007), both of which had Keira perfectly casted. As Anna, there seemed to be a problem in conveying the motivation for sacrificing her ideal marriage to Karenin (Jude Law in an understated role). I think the main problem is the lack of chemistry between Keira and Aaron Taylor-Johnson who played her illicit lover Count Vronsky. If not for that perfectly shot dance scene in the ballroom where Anna and the Count gave in to their lust, the rest of the film will make you wonder what the fuss about the Count was all about. Taylor-Johnson's Vronsky looked pretty, sulky and weak, not the dominating alpha male which would sweep Anna off her feet.Well, this movie did make me want to seek out the other film versions of the novel for comparison. It also made me want to read the source novel itself to see how such a mundane story of unfaithfulness be as timeless as this one had been. This movie failed to make me see why.",Anna Karenina
39,aharmas,Breaking More Than The Rules,10,9 December 2012,"This version of ""Anne Karenina"" is certainly more interesting than previous ones, and as it has happened before with films by Wright, he has gone into a sort of interesting mix of realism, and I'm not quite sure what to call this, ""getting inside the visual media""... At first, I was a bit dumbfounded, as he kept rolling walls, switching scenery in the middle of a scene. It was a bit unsettling, but then, I thought it was a matter of style, and because he does keep a decent amount of period set decoration and costume, I got used to his approach.The story is predictable, and the execution is the key here, with some very good acting, especially Law, as the husband who must adapt to the impulsive ways of his wife, a woman who is torn by the newly found lust/love she feels for her younger lover. Anna is a puzzling character because at first she seems to be a staunch defender of the establishment, and by the end, all signs of reason and sanity are gone. She has surrendered to pure emotional impulses, and the end is nothing but tragic. The saddest part is how her actions are just replications of what her brother did previously, but the consequences for her are much more severe, and not even her own gender offers any sympathy. We have seen this before in ""The House of Mirth"" and other works of that era. This time the film gives a more dramatic mix, throwing some innovative visuals, a lush, old-fashioned music score, and great turns by Johnson and Knightley.""Karenina"" has two stories going on, and it might be a bit confusing to see their respective functions, as the world of ""Anna"" is falling apart by her actions, the world of this other couple survives the initial shock of what some might consider ""lust"". Whatever it might be love can both a restoring and a destroying force, and to a point, honesty does play an important part in the mix.This society is interesting. Institutions are celebrated, deviations are punished accordingly, and sides are switched most conveniently. Everyone recognizes that you have to play by the rules, and these can sometimes be flexible, but compromises must be reached, and Anna is not willing to listen. It gets so bad that her few supporters eventually must spell it out for her, and there is no going back. Soon madness sets in to force her into a final solution.In the end, the film is a new retelling of a century-old problem, you just have to make sure you play by the rules, and you had better watch your step. Emotions have no place in a society that is inflexible and unforgiving.",Anna Karenina
40,dierregi,A balanced score on IMDb,6,10 January 2021,"This must be one of the rarest cases when I actually agree with the score marked on IMDB.

costumes. Either you ""get"" the point that they don't pretend to be faithful to the time or you'll hate themmise-en-scene: Again, either you buy into the idea of ""staging"" the plot, or you'll hate itNegative point:
there I agree with the majority: Taylor-Johnson is HORRIBLY miscast and that is not minor error, considering the importance of his role. Didn't like much Macfadyen, either, too jolly jovial, but his role was minor.the first dance scene with Anna and Vronsky seems a parody of Vogue, I expected to see Madonna popping by. Embarrassing, almost painful to watchI liked the movie more than expected, even if at times it does indeed seem an enlarged Chanel commercial.

41,dalydj-918-255175,Anna Karenina is an interesting new take that makes you feel the story.,9,12 September 2012,"""Keira delivers Anna as a damaged woman who is never happy."" Anna Karenina is once again adapted from the Leo Tolstoy book of the same name about Love, Life and Forgivness. The screenplay is written by Tom Stoppard with direction provided by Joe Wright. The story revolves around when Anna mets Vronsky who is to marry Kitty but when they two met the firey chemistry heats up and the film starts their. This film is structured to be heighten reality as the sets are moving and most of the film is filmed in a theatre which was the idea of the director to represent the way the Russian lived their life during those times.This film has many characters and many sets but they all seem to move in a choreography movement which I loved as I respect the idea the script presented Wright. Keira Knightley is working with Wright for the third time and she delivers a troubled woman who goes through so many emotions and feelings that at times I hated what this woman did for lust. Anna's affair is one of the main story lines but in contrast to the trouble triangular relationship of Anna (Knightley), Vronsky (Taylor-Johnson)and Alexi (Law) there is more love filled relationship between Kitty (Vikander) and Levin (Gleeson).This film is stunning to me how the direction is making a period piece like I have never seen before as so much happens in the theatre. Keira Knightley impressed me so much with how she has developed her craft since first working with Wright in 2005. This performance is her greatest so far for me as the character from start to her uncertain end is just heartbreaking and I wonder with people's hate of Keira will they respect how overly dramatic this performance can get. Jude Law plays Alexei just so different then before because usually he is portrayed as evil but in this adaptation he is more stable and human man.The other part of the triangle Vronsky is very miscast with Aaron as he does not give the character the male sexuality he should as he is too young. Matthew MacFayden plays Oblonsky the brother of Anna is the comedic element of the film and completely changes from the last Wright film he was in which was Pride and Prejudice. Vikander and Gleeson are so sweet and capture these characters so greatly in contrast to other main plot of the film.The costume design and set design of this film is the greatest in the three films of the wright period pieces. The score is just as great with being of course influenced by the Russian society. Everything about this film was amazing and fantastic to me, but I guess this is just my type of film, I can see why some people will hate who overly dramatic at times which will turn most people off, but not me.MOVIE GRADE: A- (MVP: Keira Knightley)",Anna Karenina
42,jadepietro,Russian Unorthodox,7,9 December 2012,"This film is mildly recommended."" All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players""William ShakespeareThe poster says it all about the umpteenth version of this timeless and tragic love story: ""A bold new vision of the epic story of love"". That's Anna Karenina rebooted for the modern day movie audiences of the 21st century. The film's tagline also says: ""You can't ask why about love"". No, you can't, but you can ask those involved, ""Why?"" What was the real aim of this film adaptation? Was it an intense and passionate need to film this classic novel by Leo Tolstoy? Was it a noble attempt to modernize this story for younger moviegoers? Or to use a reliable and famous source that could readily boost sales at that targeted audience? Whatever the answer may be, this version remains memorable for the lavishness of the production and some fine performances, but the film never achieves any emotional satisfaction. One can admire the film's total craftsmanship without getting any genuine pleasure from the filmed experience.In Joe Wright's opulent but fussy update, the accomplished director takes theatrics to a whole new level. Taking inspiration from the Bard's poem and ""breaking that fourth wall"", Wright literally films Tolstoy's characters as if they were mere actors performing this play upon the wicked stage of life by opening up this little Fabergé jewel box to tell his tale. In fact, the film's greatest asset is the fluid camera-work that creates lovely transitions from the stage settings to the real world. Doors open and curtains part to reveal grandiose views and vistas. The director is a master at choreographing composition and design and his trademark tracking shots are frequently in use. Sometimes this conceit works brilliantly and other times the artificiality of the enterprise seems overwrought and pretentious, with one too many self- contained tableau arrangements. Yet, his technical proficiency wins one over as he creates one indelible image after the next.It is 1874 Imperial Russia and the aristocrats exult in their upper class rules and materialistic excesses. As Anna Karenina begins, a red curtain rises and there center-stage in the proscenium are our able cast of characters, ready to begin their roles in this fragmented play. Unfortunately, they enter stage right and almost immediately exit stage left, leaving no semblance of continuity or character development in their wake. The sub-plot, using the characters of Oblonsky ( Matthew Macfadyen ), Anna's brother, Dolly, his long-suffering wife ( Kelly Macdonald ), the Countess Vronsky ( Olivia Williams ), and the younger lovers, Kitty ( Alicia Vikander ) and Levin ( Domhnall Gleeson ), feels ill-conceived and rushed. It wastes the efforts of these talented actors. But of course, the real fireworks at the heart of this ripe melodrama are our romantic and conflicted trio of lovers: Anna ( Keira Knightley), the lonely and unloved wife, and the two Alexeis: Karenin (Jude Law ), her stoic and stiff husband, and Vronsky ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson ), her flirtatious and dashing fop of a soldier. However, to make Anna Karenina really work, it is essential that the charismatic leads are convincing in their passion and self-centeredness. ( Let's face it, they're not a very likable lot. ) And two out of three tip the scales in the right direction. Ms. Knightley radiates elegance and cuts a lovely figure as our heroine. The actress can tend to accentuate the dramatic flourishes a bit, but she carries with her a hidden arsenal of vulnerability, intelligence, and tragedy that complement her interpretation of this role. As her stern and proper spouse, Law brings the perfect smarminess and rage to his role. His sense of outrage, humiliation, and hurt from his wife's scandalous behavior gives his character both sympathy and concern. But Taylor-Johnson is totally one-dimensional and lacking any sexuality as Anna's illicit partner. One seriously wonders about Anna's attraction and obsession with this man, which is not the intended reaction one should feel about this romantic liaison. The actor is miscast and outclassed, making their torrid love affair suffer from comparison. Nor did the make-up department do Taylor-Johnson any favors by turning him into Russia's first metrosexual.The actual fault of Anna Karenina stems from a disappointing screenplay written by Tom Stoppard. His script is sketchy, almost a mere outline of the original source. This adaptation leaves the supporting characters and the dense plot in shambles, devoid of any clear exposition or depth from this gifted playwright. The central story becomes too obvious from the start with all of its melodramatic rhetoric and come hither looks. After a while, the richly detailed period settings and gorgeous costumes become second nature and the movie becomes overtly dramatic, ( soap ) operatic in its execution and tone, with enough extravagance and hand-wringing despair to last a lifetime or until the next revolution. One wished that Wright could have toned down some of the theatrics and concentrated more on substance than style, but Stoppard gave him nothing to work with, narratively speaking.Still, kudos to the production team who give the moviegoers much to appreciate. Sarah Greenwood's opulent set designs, the splendid costumes by Jacqueline Durran ( Who doesn't love a deep red dress to attract attention? ), Dario Marianelli's sweeping score, and Seamus McGarvey's atmospheric photography much deserve their accolades.This Anna Karenina does have some serious flaws for most moviegoers, but it also visually captures Tolstoy's novel with unparalleled beauty and flair, thanks to Wright and his talented artisans. That alone is worth a visit to this CliffsNotes version of a great novel. Or, on second thought, you might be better off reading the book.

43,bob-rutzel-1,First half very good. Second half all soap and pointless,4,24 February 2013,"In the 1870s, Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) falls in love with Cavalry Officer Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and has his baby. This causes a scandal because she is married to Karenin (Jude Law) a very high Russian gov't official.If the Russians had TV back in the 1870s, this would have been the first soap.The first half of the movie was fantastic, exciting and lively. We had great dialogues although we had a very hard time figuring out what the players were saying and in what context. We had no idea what was going on, but it was enjoyable. We had great scenery, music and dancing (oh, I have never seen this kind of dancing where the hands and arms played as great a part in the dance as the movement of the legs of both dancers. This never caught on here, did it? Pity) Some story parts were shown on a stage for the whole world to see and other parts were not shown on a stage. Clever. The first half was kind of robotic, and almost hypnotic and you got the feeling that this was quite a marvelous pinball machine at work here. The choreography of the players as they moved in and out of time and places was seamless. So too were the stage hands who broke down the scenes to set up the next shot with curtain going up and up and up to give us another view of either an inside shot or an outside one. It was like peeling an onion back to get to the meat. This was all quite creative and poetic and left us breathless. We are swooning here, can't you tell?And, yet the first half gave no hint of what this was all about. We didn't know where we were going and it didn't matter. The first half was fun. But – oh,oh - we did see some eye contact between married Anna and the single Count Vronsky .and..and.ah.. here it comes: the start of the second half. Here we goThe second half was all soap. Anna and the Count dallied, and Karenin , her husband, fumed. Then along comes a baby, and high society shuns Anna. Typical soap. See?My advice: watch the first half only and then go watch another Bond, James Bond movie. Skyfall, I think is the latest one. If you end up watching the second half, you will come away muttering to yourself, ""why are certain movies made?"" coming up with no answer. However, you could read the book. Oh, the acting all around is good and by now you should have figured out that Karenin was actually Jude Law (hey, I didn't know he was in this thing hiding behind that beard, mustache and glasses.) But, it was him. Let's face it - a story like this with today's openness and lack of inhibitions just doesn't work and not many care. This is for literary scholars. They care. We don't. (4/10)Violence: Not really. Sex: Yes, but camera angles made viewing difficult to see anything. Nudity: No. Language: No.",Anna Karenina
44,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Despite problems with the script at the bookends, the aesthetics are Wright's best yet.",7,26 June 2013,"I haven't been big on Joe Wright ever since I saw and hated Atonement. I've pretty much winced at the thought of watching another of his films since. I decided to give his Pride & Prejudice a chance and was delighted to see that it was approached in a different way to how I disliked in Atonement. As this is one of my favourite Oscar years ever where every film at least intrigues me (Snow White pair aside), I decided I may as well watch Anna Karenina and I was pleased to see that he also approached this in a different way to Atonement. Although his taste for material is consistent with period dramas, it's interesting how he adjusts his style slightly. Anna Karenina is similar to Atonement though, with its lush production, costumes and brisk pace, but without the contrivance and sentimentality that ruined the latter.It has some of his best aesthetics yet and I'm a fan of the stage-like approach to presenting the film. However, similarly to Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, if you're not familiar with the source material in the first place then Anna Karenina is quite hard to follow. It's a very bad habit in adapting classic material to not consider those who are going to introduce themselves to it with the film. Although I enjoyed the production and the fantastic ensemble (particularly Knightley), the first act was very messy and I struggled to get to the meat of the characters, only the eccentricities. Fortunately, once it got to the second act and focused on the simple story it was absolutely compelling. Unfortunately, the last act is just as messy as the first to the point of where I'm still not clear on what happened and that does hold the film back for me. Still Wright's strongest effort so far and I hope it wins its nominations.7/10",Anna Karenina
45,tomsview,Baz Luhrmann without the songs?,7,20 November 2018,"Presented as a cross between real life and a theatrical production, the filmmakers possibly thought ""Anna Karenina"" has been done straight so many times that they needed to do something different.It feels a bit like Baz Luhrmann's approach to ""Moulin Rouge"", but without ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" and ""Nature Boy"". Some of it also reminded me of the staginess of ""My Fair Lady"" - minus the songs.The structure is distracting although the underlying tragedy still has bite.This is Tolstoy's take on Gustave Flaubert's ""Madam Bovary"" transposed to Russia and advanced a notch or two up the social ladder. It's the story of a romantic, unsatisfied woman married to a stolid, unexciting man. When she thinks she has found true love with a dashing officer, everything falls apart leaving her feeling that she has no alternative but to exit life.A famous producer once said that the thing that makes a film memorable is the last five minutes. Anna's suicide delivers that memorable ending most notably in the 1935 Greta Garbo version. In that she simply steps between two train carriages; one minute she's there and the next she's gone.I can't help feeling that the death scene has been overdone in nearly all other versions. We can guess what happens when someone goes under a train - bystanders and emergency workers need plenty of counselling after witnessing such an event. The way it is dealt with here robs it of much of its impact.The film incorporates the parallel story of Konstantin Levin and his life in the Russian countryside - eliminated in some film versions. In this case though it opens the film out from the claustrophobic theatrical setting. If there is one thing I miss in this version it's the vastness of Russia. Lean delivered it in ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ever since then I've wanted my movies set in historic Russia to be played out in front of snow covered onion domes and vistas of endless steppes with at least two thousand extras thrown in.Still, you can't go wrong with dressing Keira Knightley in the furs and ball gowns of pre-revolutionary Russia, she loses nothing when compared to Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh and all the other Anna's.Likewise, Jude Law is a fine Karenin, capturing the stiffness of the character as well as the vulnerability. It's just that the actors have to compete with the all the fireworks of the filmmaking technique.",Anna Karenina
46,rivertam26,A Masterwork,8,1 December 2012,"I've been a fan of film for a long time. Each piece no matter what it is, exists as a piece of artwork. A medium in which everyone involved can communicate whatever creation they have conceived. Some are more successful than others at communicating that notion. But therein lies the beauty different things can mean different things to each individual. And since film is art and that is how it should be viewed it's important to open up and experience what those messages are they are trying to get across. Joe Wright is such a brilliant film maker he blew me away with his sumptuous, brilliant film Atonement. And now in Anna Karenina he creates a rich tapestry of heart stopping visuals and a complex rooted character piece that may have taken on a bit too much. Keira Knightley as most of the time shines in the lead. Her rich, flirtatious, wounded performance is another in a long line, in a truly memorable career. She exudes the time period and elegance of her role. Jude Law is the best he's been in years as her long suffering husband and Aaron Johnson the teenage boy from Kick ass has really stepped up his game this year with Savages and now this film he mystifies as a sexual, seductive, adult man. Gone is the boy and has been replaced with someone to truly keep an eye on. Like my favorite film of all time Moulin Rouge, Anna Karenina redefines on how not just this story but any can be told. Set from the point of view on a stage. Symbolic of the way they were viewed in that time period, at times it feels as if though they are about to burst out in song. Sparkling with hints of inspired choreography and a masterwork in cinematography and art direction the film moves creatively from one scene to the next. A cinematic patchwork of inspired storytelling, never seen before. The film's only real dilemma lies within the story itself. Too many story lines are explored and not too fulfillment and although the main love triangle should have been given a bit more focus it's hard to deny the sheer power of it's execution and the fine performances all around that solidify that. With truly striking cinematography, maybe the best I've ever seen, art direction, costume and set design that will blow your mind, strong performances and an accomplished and a ambitious sense of direction Anna Karenina is a bold, sensuous, masterwork of a film and true piece of art that should be reveled. 4/5",Anna Karenina
47,napierslogs,A beautiful production that transforms Anna Karenina into a modern woman,10,28 January 2013,"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats; the play is about to begin. And thus, with the curtains drawn back, the ingenuity, creativity and brilliance of Joe Wright's ""Anna Karenina"" begins. By taking it out of an unforgiving landscape and placing it inside a theatre to unfold on an infinite stage, but keeping it in 1870s Russia, we have a true-to- source story that can be adapted for our modern enjoyment.Joe Wright-muse, Keira Knightley, plays the Russian aristocrat Anna Karenina. After 9 years of marriage producing only one child with the clinical but successful and important bureaucrat, Karenin (Jude Law), Anna becomes disillusioned. While visiting family in Moscow, Anna falls for the generous nature of the handsome and affluent Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Law is as cold and uncompromising as the Russian landscape while Taylor-Johnson is as sensual and smouldering as the summer-time sun. But Anna lives in an almost constant state of winter, and only one of them is able to function in a time of death. Law's minimal compassion downplaying his famous looks in a beautiful, understated subtle performance does not go unnoticed. Both men provide perfectly balanced counter-points as Anna begins to unravel.It's a tale of love, betrayal and heart-break. And there are two significant ideas within that theme that the film manages to play up. The first being that this is timeless, Anna could be a modern woman. In fact, Anna could be any one of us; we could be Anna. The second is that a movie with devastating themes does not need to be devastating. The contradictory nature of that is incredibly astute and is presented beautifully, delicately and even humorously. It is an amazing feat to turn a story about loss into a funny, up-beat and theatrical show of life.It's hard not to get wrapped up in the beauty of the sets. With the camera rolling, we seamlessly move from scene to scene with the score keeping beat and keeping us in line. The entire movie is whimsical and lively; it counteracts the coldness of the Russian climate – literally, illustratively and romantically. The visuals of the theatre sets, colour-symbolic costumes and the impeccable choreography are able to move the story along with very little dialogue. I have never been so involved in a story where dialogue was only a tertiary component.But ""Anna Karenina"" is not just about the production design; it's about Anna. She is a marvellously complex woman. She doesn't want her life to only be determined by love but she just doesn't know how to live it any other way. She wants to be spontaneous, impetuous and happy – acting before she knows what she wants. She is unfortunately manic, rushing to the next stage of her life without knowing how to get there. But she's also wondrously independent, determined to give herself what she wants, ready to dive-in head first after her heart. As Knightley said, Anna represents the best of us and the worst of us. Here she is a modern woman in modern times where we instantly connect to her but instead of fearing depression, the film gives us a sense of hope, optimism and satisfaction.",Anna Karenina
48,proud_luddite,Rather good,7,22 August 2020,"In this British film, based on the classic Leo Tolstoy novel, the upper class of Russia is scandalized by an adulterous affair within their ranks.The consensus seems to be that although this is a good film, it is a disappointment considering its expectations. In the beginning, the style does take a while to get used to. Many segments of the film are set up to take place on a stage. Other theatrical gimmicks are used to change scenes. Once accustomed to this style, however, the film does appeal.Many fascinating themes are explored: the extreme repression and hypocrisy of the social mores of the place and time; the contrast between one relationship that is forbidden and passionate vs. one that appears passionless but has more stability than expected; and the rivalry between Russia's two largest cities, St. Petersburg and Moscow.At just over two hours, the film could not fully capture the essence of the novel but it's still fascinating and entertaining in its own way. - dbamateurcritic",Anna Karenina
49,MihaiSorinToma,A high-class boredom,6,18 July 2017,"A beautiful and well seen member of the Russian High-Class society, married and having one child, falls in love with a charming count with whom she starts an affair. From there on, her life takes a dramatic turn for the worse, as she wasn't expecting most of the people's reactions after her deed.It's a movie which wants to present how a person's reputation can alter so quickly after using the heart to think, instead of the brain, leaving all possible consequences aside. Somehow, it managed to enroll its plot in a lengthy and boring way, with little interest gained along the way. You'll be baffled by the main characters' decisions, while the results are to be expected after such foolish judgement. While the movie itself is average at most in almost every single way, the actors do a really good job in building their characters, helped a bit by the provided dialog. Too bad that the plot was such a let-down.",Anna Karenina
50,gelman@attglobal.net,Artificial but brilliant,10,31 December 2012,"The many artifices employed in this version of Tolstoy's great novel, beginning with the opening presentation of the story as a theatrical event, are not only unusual, they are also off-putting for many film goers. In my opinion, they have been used to intensify the action and the emotion at critical points. Anna Karenina defies condensation and previous versions have fallen far short of conveying the overpowering emotion at the heart of the love affair between Anna and Count Vronsky or Anna's tormented decision to abandon her son or her humiliation at the hands of her social circle. This version succeeds on all these counts, I believe. There is, for example, a stop action dancing scene which captures as no other film has done the intoxication that Anna is experiencing during her first real encounter with Vronsky and another scene when they first consummate their love during which the camera whirls around their bodies without fully displaying their nakedness. The passion is unmistakable, more so than if the act of intercourse had been more realistically shown. Maybe I'm prejudiced because I believe Keira Knightley is the most beautiful woman on the planet but I think she is the perfect Anna and a much better actress than most critics say she is. This is the third of her performances with the same director -- Pride & Prejudice and Atonement are the others -- for which I would have given her an Oscar. And both Tom Stoppard who wrote the script and Joe Wright, Knightley's director, have served the story exceedingly well. Three other major achievements: (i) Jude Law makes a very convincing Karenin, establishing the man's stiff moralistic nature and his wounded pride as well as his generosity when he is willing to forgive Anna although she has betrayed him. (2) Count Vronsky is portrayed, as he should be -- a beautiful but shallow lover, unable in the end to sustain Anna emotionally when she finds that she is a social pariah. (3) The important parallel love story between the idealistic Levin and young Kitty, with whom he is obsessed -- as pure as the love between Anna and Vronsky is corrupt -- is beautifully depicted, though perhaps at lesser length than it deserves. I know I'm bucking the trend, but I consider this Anna to be a major achievement and the artificiality in much of the film works for me.",Anna Karenina
51,lopezpatricia-06139,DREADFUL,1,31 July 2021,The first 10mins we didn't know what this film was. Was it a musical was it a theatre production. Was it a comedy. All of this happened under the synopsis of period drama. We then turned off. We felt dizzy.,Anna Karenina
52,Dan1863Sickles,Playing It Safe,3,2 November 2013,"There's so much wrong with this movie version of ANNA KARENINA, beyond the fact that Keira Knightley has no idea what kind of person Anna is, or why she does what she does, or what the point of her story might actually be.You see, the real problem is with the men at the top, Tom Stoppard who wrote the screenplay and Joe Wright (aka Joe Blow, aka Joe Mama, aka Clown Boy) who directed from puppet central. They are afraid to offend anyone. So they deliberately cast weak, incompetent actors for the major parts because they don't like or understand Tolstoy's world view.VRONSKY -- many reviewers have compared this pouffed up, vaguely effeminate, clown-version of Vronsky to Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. They are correct. The real Vronsky would have been better portrayed by someone like Charles Bronson, or Yul Brynner. But a brutal, threatening, masculine Vronsky would have raised the stakes in a way a ""polite"" modern audience wouldn't have liked or understood. Making him a metrosexual makes the love story less threatening for a sophisticated audience that can't acknowledge sex as a brutal, lawless enterprise. So bring in the pouffed up pretty boys! LEVIN -- Why cast a fifteen year old skateboarder with a phony beard to play a tough, virile man of the earth like Levin? Well, an authentic Levin would make the polite modern audience just as uncomfortable as an authentic Vronsky. Levin is an aristocrat who feels genuine shame at his unearned privilege and who works very hard to sweat for his daily bread. The problem is that a modern audience doesn't want to see that sort of thing because it raises the embarrassing fact that the gap between rich and poor in the modern world is even more glaring than it was in Czarist Russia. (The poor still have nothing, but the rich have so much more, like DVD's full of empty glamorous movies like this.) It's easier to picture a goofball Levin scything away just for the fun of it, like he's a hot-dogging skateboarder, without any of that tiresome pain and fear and guilt. So that's how he's portrayed.ANNA KARENINA -- Some people say Keira Knightly can only play bitches. Other people say she can only play herself. But I don't think it's just personal flaws that make her performance so lifeless. You see, the nub of the problem is that bringing the ""real"" Anna to life would shock and outrage the sophisticated feminist audience. They don't want to see the woman Tolstoy wrote about -- a woman who is genuinely remorseful, wracked with guilt, and deeply ambivalent about her own bad behavior. The film makers are actually playing it safe, making Anna just another fiery virgin who stands up for herself. The real Anna is neither fiery, nor a virgin. But it's not just that Keira plays what she knows how to play. The film makers present what they know the audience can handle. Ambivalence, self-disgust, tragedy -- those things are too scary to take on. Better to just pretend this is Elizabeth Bennett standing up to Mr. Darcy, and not something infinitely more tragic and adult.So basically, whenever Anna is arguing with her husband Karenin, (and who would have thought that Jude Law would be the only actor to hold up his own end) she isn't allowed to show remorse, regret, or human feelings of any kind. All she can do is look spoiled and spiteful, like she's a fifteen year old being told she can't stay out till 3 AM. Every time Karenin brings up tiresome stuff like duty and responsibility Keira just goes into her spoiled spitfire eye-rolling frenzy, not because that's all she knows how to do but because that's all she's allowed to. Because the men at the top are playing it safe. Again.",Anna Karenina
53,cardsrock,Unique to say the least,6,31 December 2020,"The staging of this film is certainly something I hadn't seen before. The majority of scenes are made to look like everything is happening on a theater stage. This style doesn't add a whole lot to the film though. While the costumes, production design, music, and cinematography are all terrific, I'm afraid I can't say the same about the story. It just didn't really capture me and I found a lot of the film to be boring. Anna Karenina may be a classic text, but I can't use the same adjective for this retelling.",Anna Karenina
54,Laakbaar,"OK, but too stylised for my taste",6,2 January 2013,"Many consider Tolstoy's Anna Karenina to be the greatest novel ever written. It's a complicated, sprawling novel filled with a variety of characters and dealing with quite a few psychological, cultural, social and political themes. It's not an easy matter to transfer this to a two-hour film.Not that filmmakers haven't tried. This historical costume drama is the 13th attempt to capture it all on celluloid, this time the director being Joe Wright and the screenwriter none other than Tom Stoppard.This movie is highly stylised and rather experimental in its approach. These unrealistic and stylised aspects were interesting, but they were unexpected and a little confusing. They didn't really work for me. I found it difficult to lose myself in the film. I felt the movie was too artificial and contrived. The whole movie felt choreographed. Perhaps it was too sophisticated for me.I went to this movie to get reacquainted with the story, to be dazzled by the grandeur and strangeness of 19th c. Russia, to gain insights into the human condition, but most of all to be moved. However, I really only got the first of these.The acting was good in the circumstances, but the character of Anna rather annoyed me. Vronsky did nothing for me. It didn't help that my friend disliked the movie to the point of walking out after less than an hour. It's hard to rate the film highly when that happens.",Anna Karenina
55,SquigglyCrunch,Boooooooooooooring...,4,13 April 2017,"Anna Karenina follows a married woman who falls for another man and, despite her attempts to fight her feelings, ultimately engages in an affair. The movie won an Oscar for it's costumes and they are good. They're extravagant and very fitting of the time period. It had a few good ideas when it comes to story and presentation, but it was clear that it was shooting for style over substance here. The movie at first plays itself out like a play being performed on stage, with set pieces moving and changing while the actors are still acting on stage, but it quickly abandoned that idea for typical directing. I had two problems with this movie that really weighed it down. One of them was the pacing. It's so boring. The characters are impossible to relate to, and most everything about it is largely generic. We've seen it all before, so there really wasn't anything going for it. My second problem was the length. It was way too long, and even faked out it's ending on occasion. I found myself begging for it to just end already. Combine bad pacing with too much on the run time, and you've got a recipe for disaster. And that's what this is. Overall Anna Karenina had some good ideas, but is basically just a generic snorefest. In the end I wouldn't recommend it.",Anna Karenina
56,TheSquiss,"A fantastic, emotionally charged, invigorating & thrilling first hour that becomes a plodding, laborious chore to watch.",5,16 October 2012,"Anna Karenina is one of those books that reside upon the bookcase, alongside Leo Tolstoy's other epic, War and Peace, and the I Ching, untouched and awaiting the caress of fingers when retirement finally arrives. You know you must, you hope you will but, like most copies of The Lord of the Rings, all but the first couple of chapters will probably remain creaseless, unread, unappreciated and unloved.But that's what the movies are for, right? Hmmm.Anna Karenina has the feel of a 900 page novel squeezed into two hours that Oh. Right, that explains it, then. To be fair, the novel is only 846 pages long and the film rolls out a full 130 minutes but somehow it manages to feel both rushed and incredibly slow. Or rather, after the explosion of the stunning first hour, much of director Joe Wright's (Hanna, Atonement) work is undone with a plodding second half that prompts yawns, frequent glances at the watch and, in the case of the woman in front with my footprint on the back of her head, near-constant use of her phone.Anna Karenina (Keira Knightly), a 19th century Russian aristocrat, strays from her marriage to Alexia Karenin (Jude Law) and embarks on an affair with the young, charismatic Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The scandal threatens to derail not just her marriage but every aspect of her life as society divides itself into 'those who do' and 'those who get caught' and judges her accordingly.Given the mammoth task set him, Tom Stoppard makes an admirable attempt at making the severely edited story flow smoothly but various subplots that are necessary to add depth and variation from the tense core plot line feel disconnected and almost superfluous, enjoyable strands that never fully entwine. Stoppard, sadly better known nowadays for his screenplays, including Empire of the Sun and Shakespeare in Love, rather than his plays, might have produced a genuine epic had he been awarded a full three hours or a TV mini-series with a Hollywood feature budget. But he wasn't and he can't.That first hour is stunning. Anna Karenina oozes theatricality with much of the film shot in a theatre with exquisite backdrops, trompe l'oeil and movable walls that open onto vast ballrooms or expansive snow-covered fields. In one scene the theatre is a house with the wings and flies standing in for bustling streets, in the next an ice-rink, then a racecourse with thundering horses, then a field of swaying corn, then Wright's trademark lingering shots flow seamlessly, segueing from one location to another as the intensity builds. The score becomes immediate and unavoidable as musicians adorned with restoration era make-up stroll through the scenes and officials stamp documents rhythmically. The fluidity of the camera and the characters movements is mesmerizing; characters roll out of one jacket and into another, glide across rooms, turn and sink into chairs without pause. Everything is choreographed precisely, excitingly. An early waltz ramps up the heart rate as the intensity builds with stamping feet, the brush of silk dresses against flesh, the sexually charged breaths, the glances that bellow their intent. It is an incredibly powerful, fantastic sequence and a highlight of a remarkable first act.Wright embraces the use of models, not shooting his trains to fool us with his miniature reality but enjoying the game; maybe none of this is real, maybe all of this is a performance in our minds and our playrooms using railway sets and toys. In one emotionally expressive scene in the final act, Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) communicate with a child's letter blocks, vocalizing little but saying much. It could very easily have been twee but Wright and his actors make the atmosphere crackle with intensity.As Anna, Knightly impresses with her growing range after this year's double whammy of A Dangerous Method and Seeking a Friend for the End of the World but too often reminds us that she is a 21st century actress rather than an aristocrat from another time. Jude Law is steely, controlled and intense as the cuckold. But the standout performances are from Taylor-Johnson as the charming but dishonest third corner of the love triangle and Vikander as the young lady he spurns. In the case of Taylor-Johnson it is a statement that he is an actor of immense ability and versatility (to wit: Savages, Kick-Ass, Albert Nobbs, Nowhere Boy) and with Vikander it is an announcement of her arrival on the English language scene.It's been said that a film is only as good as its last fifteen minutes, in which case Anna Karenina is a plodding, laborious chore to watch. What a shame it follows a fantastic, emotionally charged, invigorating and thrilling first hour. Watch it on DVD on a HUGE screen, arrange for it to pack up after an hour and then imagine the rest of the film is just as good.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.ukLike the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",Anna Karenina
57,diane-34,Feudal Russia: so beautiful so bad!,10,18 March 2013,"Diane and I attended this sumptuous movie two days ago and the memory of it still haunts. Diane is the literary half of our team and since she had reread the entire book some months ago was drawn to the viewing. I on the other hand have never read (shame) Tolstoy's masterpiece but I wanted to see what has drawn people to the book and then its incantations as a movie. I loathe feudalism and anybody's monarchism (including the Brit's) so seeing why Communism happened was a vision that I knew was right. Keira Knightly has been lauded for her recreation of the lead role and very rightly so because it seemed that she was rarely off screen: the movie was her and if she blew it, she surely didn't, then the movie would have fallen. I, however, was mesmerized by the costumes and (at least to my eye) the accuracy of the interiors as well as the exteriors dominated by the old steamer trains. Visually the film is amazing and should be seen for that reason alone. Diane, who knows the book, attests to the accuracy of the characterization. Her major comment and that is not a detraction was that the screenplay modified sections of the book considerably because they were longer and too detailed for the screenplay.

58,abcvision,Superb- grass greener on the other side,10,23 November 2012,"Recreating a classic like Leo Tolstoy's 600 pages Anna Karenina into a major movie is quite a challenge and the movie Anna Karenina will simply blow you away. A timeless tale of the choice between a safe and secure relationship versus one filled with passion and love. Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) is conflicted with this delicate balance. In 18th Century the Russian capital was moved from Moscow to St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg was mostly aligned with Western Europe, mostly France and was center of cultural life. The scenes are breathtaking and costumes are exquisite. On the big screen you are transported to the 18th century and can't resist in rooting for love and passion even though this choice can leave a messy trail. Anna grows to be a strong woman but in the end she is wavers back in forth until she allow destiny to take hold. Enter the sumptuous world of Anna Karenina and see a movie about the beauty and complexity of love.",Anna Karenina

Keira Knightley is brilliant but her character arc yo-yos between every mad shrew character cliche. Some dialogue, and some shots are spellbinding, but on the whole, while the scenes and translations of Russian literature to the who's who of British actors and their dry wit, the pacing and the plot is both boring and rushed.

60,cat_ranchero,Visually stunning... Great drama...,8,31 August 2013,"Beautifully shot using a very theatrical style. In fact the majority of the action uses a theatre as its backdrop and I even spotted a section of stop-motion animation at one point. Sumptuous costumes, for which it won an Oscar, and some brilliantly choreographed set pieces are the backbone of this production. Of course we must not forget it is a drama and there's plenty of that with some really excellent performances to back it up. Keira Knightly went up in my estimation with this one; as did Jude Law; they both put in great performances. Also worthy of note was Aaron Taylor-Johnson; who I have watched with interest over the past few years and is rapidly growing into a very fine actor (& yes, he is that guy from 'Kick-Ass'). I was a little concerned that it may be a case of 'style over substance', but as it wore on I became more and more engrossed in the characters and the storyline. I guess this shows that the drama did manage to shine through (at least for me). The only thing that let it down was the fact the sub-plot involving Levin and Kitty didn't really have a lot to do with Anna and Vronsky by the time we saw the last of them; it seemed a little disjointed. Over all though, a very worthy watch and one, I'm sure my sister would definitely enjoy!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Anna Karenina

62,yris2002,"Emotionally gripping, and visually stunning",8,2 March 2013,"There's a kind of magic spell in Joe Wright's adaptation of Tolstoy's drama, and the spell lies in its setting in a sumptuous and yet decaying theatre, to let the camera sometimes go outside to embrace an enchanting and romantically sublime countryside. The final product is stunning: the contrast between the claustrophobic interiors, and the breathing outdoors, mirroring the contrast between the artificiality of aristocratic life and the true life of countrymen, is fully rendered through vivid and striking images. Bright colours abound, together with striking chiaroscuro effects, and then the brilliance of jewels, the sumptuousness of dresses, everything perfectly combined to give an emotionally gripping drama, wisely counterbalanced by the vastness and purity of outdoor natural landscapes, which like impressionist paintings let fresh air enter our lungs and relieve our emotional stress.The director is not new to artistic contamination and here Tom Stoppard's inquisitive screenplay supports the effective and involving experimentation so carefully built up by Wright. Moreover, very good acting is delivered by Keira Knightley, although these roles particularly suit her diaphanous and meagre physical appearance, here her interpretation appears intense as never before, but also the role of Karenin is thoroughly brought to life by Jude Law. If you are somehow afraid of former transpositions of Russian literature masterpieces, forget about them. This is something totally new and original, where literature, theatre and cinema are fused to offer a tragic and emotionally vivid representation of life, making justice to the true essence of the novel and to the real nature of a still charming heroine.",Anna Karenina

64,emuir-1,Filmmakers should not have to explain what they were trying to do. It should be obvious.,1,16 August 2014,"With a script by Tom Stoppard, and a sterling cast which included Jude Law, and Emily Watson I thought this couldn't go wrong, until the Baz Luhrman style kicked in. What the heck were they doing? Why did they have a proscenium arch around the outdoor scenes. Why did the dancers stop and start? Why the theatrical overacting? Was the director trying to mount a grand opera, a musical or a stage play? It was not until I watched the bonus features where Joe wright explained what he was trying to do that it all fell into place; however, I feel that when an actor or director has to explain in a featurette or media interview what he was trying to do, then he didn't do it very well or he would not have needed to explain. It should be made clear to the audience at the beginning. Once I understood what they were doing portraying the theatrical make believe in which the main characters lived their lives, imprisoned by false rules, it all made sense. The concept really wasn't too bad and actually seemed clever, especially when it was about the 10th remake of an old bodice ripper, but I think bookends would have helped, where a modern theater company were gathering to rehearse a performance of Anna Karenina, then at the end they left a deserted theater after dark as the lights went out and the stage hands wished them Good Night! I know that this has been done many times, but it does help show why the production is so off the wall. A similar structure was done successfully with 'Oh What a Lovely War', where the Great War was depicted as a theatrical revue with songs and dances and the generals keeping score as if it was a cricket match or a talent contest, but that had come from a brilliant ground breaking stage musical and we knew what to expect.A last word, whether it was intended or not, I felt really sorry for Karenin who was really a decent chap, if a little stuffy, and wanted to slap Anna. Tude Law was the only reason I stayed with the film to the very welcome end.",Anna Karenina
65,Ryan_MYeah,"Such a beautiful mess of a movie. Keira Knightley still excels, though.",6,2 December 2012,"Man, Keira Knightley must really enjoy love triangles. As if movies like Love Actually, The Duchess, and Never Let Me Go weren't enough, she has another one to add to her résumé, Joe Wright's unique and experimental take on Leo Tolstoy's classic Anna Karenina. Wright has directed some terrific films such as Pride & Prejudice (My favorite movie of 2005), and Atonement (One of my favorites of 2007). He faced a recent slump with The Soloist and Hanna, and it appears he may still be in that slump, even when he's in his natural element.The film examines many sub plots and characters that it's hard to completely summarize it. The main focus is of Anna Karenina, a woman married to government official Karenin, a man twenty years her senior. The two of them also have a son. Finding herself not in love with her husband, she begins having a secret affair with a young cavalry officer named Vronsky. Interjected throughout are the troubles of friends and family surrounding her: Including her brother Stiva and his wife Dolly, a friend of Stiva's named Konstantin, and the object of Konstantin's desires, young Kitty, who also fancies Vronsky.I'm going to divide my thoughts on this movie into three sections.1: The technical design of this movie is gorgeous beyond comprehension. Joe Wright has always had a keen visual eye, and this movie further proves that. The movement of Seamus McGarvy's photography is fluid and sweeping, choreographed to the action and the music with such precision. Jacqueline Durran provides costumes that rival her work for Atonement. Production Designer Sarah Greenwood is MVP, though. Something I really love is the fact that most of the movie is set within a small theater, so the stage and the seating area have to change styles to fit the mood and surroundings of each scene. It's spectacular stuff.2: The acting is great throughout. If I were to give specifics, I would say that Keira Knightley gives one of the best, if not the best performance of her career. Terrific as always, the way she manages to hold this movie together is commendable. Surrounding her is a talented who's who of UK talent. Jude Law manages to convey both the stern and heartbroken sides of his character. Matthew MacFadyen provides much of the film's comic relief. Kelly MacDonald takes a break from Boardwalk Empire with soft and heartfelt understanding. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the one weak link, so wooden as to channel cardboard.3: Here's where we get into the groaning and grumbling portion of the review. While I appreciate the look and the talent that went into making this movie, I must note that the direction too often must make up for the story's shortcomings. The script by Tom Stoppard feels very uneven, but that may have more to do with the movie's biggest flaw. The pacing of the movie is simply awful. The first act is not bad at all, but the second act slogs along at a rate that is punishingly slow, which also affects the final act as well.Overall, it's clear that Joe Wright and everyone involved wanted this to be a good movie, and had the pace been more even, this would be a good movie. Unfortunately, the lack of rhythm docks a full star off the final rating.*** / *****",Anna Karenina
66,nicolechan916,"Great acting, chemistry and settings but a confusing yet shallow plot line.",7,11 August 2014,"Having not read the book by Leo Tolstoy of the same name, I liked the film pretty well. It was mainly about the affair between Karenina and Vronsky, and there wasn't very much story to go on, but the atmosphere and props were really well done and kept me interested.The acting was also really good, what really surprised me was Aaron Taylor-Johnson. He looked vaguely familiar but I couldn't place where I'd seen him from until I saw the credits. He took a 180 degree turn from Kick-Ass and actually looked really dashing here. He toned up really well, and on top of that, his acting was superb. I could totally feel his love for Anna; his facial expressions and everything really made it believable that he was of that era.The chemistry between Vronsky-Anna and Anna-Alexei was really good, and you could feel that both these characters loved Anna. I felt sympathetic towards Alexei as he was a good man. Anna on the other hand, soon became mad, probably because she had an affair and that raised her suspicions to a whole new level.The foreboding scenes in this film were quite good. I didn't actually think of the importance of that scene where the coal man checking the train dies, but understood immediately at the end.I feel like they could have stopped when Anna died, because it felt a bit too dramatic towards the end. Also, I did not get the importance of the second story line with Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kitty (Alicia Vikander).

Keira Knightley was so obviously miscast. Her extremely bony frame and face always remind me of concentration camp survivors, terrible. I suppose she did the best she could, but it was painful to watch her trying to make something out of this lamentable part in which she did NOT fit. 
The costumes were marvellous and some scenery was beautiful, but the movie was a terrible DUD. Count Vronsky was played as a kind of caricature, awful. Jude Law virtually unrecognisable, strove decently in his role.

68,RichardSRussell-1,"One of the Great Stories of All Time Plays 2nd Fiddle to Stagecraft, but WHAT Stagecraft!",7,30 November 2012,"Remember that scene early in Inception where Leonardo di Caprio and Ellen Page are sitting at a sidewalk cafe as he explains how his dream technology works? He points out that in a dream you never question the time, place, or circumstances in which you find yourself, you just accept them as normal. Suddenly windows start exploding, pavement buckles, the streets of Paris start curving over their heads, and you realize that the entire sequence has played out just the way he described it. You, sitting in the audience, never questioned how they got to that cafe in the 1st place, you just took it for granted.The reason Christopher Nolan was able to pull this off so deftly was that we bring the same short-cut sensibility with us to the movies. We see a person in an office, a taxi, a restaurant, and an apartment in quick succession but don't want to be bored with the tedium of actually getting from one of those locales to the next, so we gladly accept the cinematic convention of just jump-cutting from scene to scene.The most recent (of many) productions of Anna Karenina, Leo Tolstoy's classic novel of a high-society scandal in doomed imperial Russia circa 1890, reveals some of this artifice to the inquisitive eye. Much of the film appears to be set on an actual theater stage, but characters walk on and off that stage to what appears to be the real world — or saunter backstage to have it turn into a train station. Much of it is stilted and artificial — such as all the other dancers freezing in position during the Platonic ideal of a ballroom waltz (with heavy swing-dance styling), as Anna and Vronsky swirl among them. The extent of privilege of the Russian noble classes is underlined by the way in which the various counts and dukes just casually hold out a hand, expecting out of habit that a drink or the next piece of paperwork will be instantly placed there by an obsequious lackey, or holding out an arm while doing a 360, never questioning that the office suit coat will be removed by the left-hand lackey while the evening jacket is being simultaneously slipped on by the right-hand one. And director Joe Wright cuts the audience no expositional slack whatsoever in introducing the characters or keeping their various nicknames straight (and Russians have lots of nicknames); you just have to pick up who's who on your own.The costuming is sumptuous and seems a lock for this year's Oscar in that category. However, I was bemused that, shortly after leaving the Sundance Theater, I swung by the Middleton Marriott to drop off some fliers at TeslaCon, a steampunk immersion convention, and found myself walking into the kind of artificial environment Wright had created, with congoers all self-costumed nearly as well as the best Hollywood could produce.All of this style and metapresentation comes at a price, however, and the price is the humanity of the characters. Due to the mode of presentation, we can never suspend our disbelief long enuf to start thinking of them as real people; they remain actors in a play, and we're never allowed to forget it.Keira Knightley is radiant as Anna, and Jude Law is agonizingly prim, principled, and earnest as Karenin (and we can't help but feel serious empathy for him, despite learning that his parliamentary maneuverings represent the worst form of bigotry), but I was disappointed in Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky. He seemed too effete and foppish and not nearly dashing enuf to win Anna's heart at first glance. But then, as he remarked, ""you can't ask why about love.""This version of AK will certainly be remembered more for its staging than for its story. Perhaps that's excusable, since the story has been told so many times before, and often well and beautifully, but it's a shame that we were reduced to thinking of it as a necessary nuisance getting in the way of the stagecraft.",Anna Karenina

73,timmy_501,Brilliant adaptation,10,17 March 2013,"Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is one of the most acclaimed novels of all time, not least of all because of the excellence of the book's themes. These themes of Tolstoy's are expressed extremely well in Joe Wright's adaptation of Anna Karenina. First and foremost and the area that really sets the film apart is the theatricality of certain settings in the film. Many scenes take place on sets made to resemble the stage, especially early on. I was initially baffled by this choice but I slowly came to realize that it functions as a way to make visual the artificiality of the world inhabited by Anna Karenina, specifically its outdated values. It's extremely clear that Russia was undergoing a major transition during the time in which the narrative is set. Trains and railways play a major role in the film and of course trains are a common symbol of technological progress. There's more than passing reference to the freeing of the serfs and the radical ideology even of some aristocrats, which echoes the life of Tolstoy himself. Much is also made of the cultural shifts in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the former of which had apparently become rather old-fashioned compared to the relatively progressive Petersburg at the time. The film suggests that the reaction of the country's upper class was to ignore the major changes that were occurring and cling all the harder to the past, especially with regards to social institutions. Thus the eponymous heroine finds it impossible to escape her loveless marriage with any social standing intact, which eventually drives her mad. This isn't just a plainly literal translation of the source, however, as Wright's clever use of the stage is just one of many visual techniques he uses to make this material cinematic. Wright's use of landscape is unusually strong, particularly in the surreal final shot. His use of mirrors made me think of some of the works of RW Fassbinder, another supreme visual stylist. Another neat touch is having background characters freeze and fade into the background to suggest the heightened emotional state of the main characters, particularly in the scene where Anna has her first dance with the rakish Vronsky. Overall, another excellent movie from one of the most promising English language directors of his generation and the best 2012 film I've seen so far.",Anna Karenina
74,cnycitylady,A good rendition of a great book,7,14 December 2012,"I liked the film, of course it could have been better; there is always room for more detail from the book, but with the time given I think they got the basic story across very well. I loved what the director did with the set, it was very like a play as the scenery changed around them and how their clothes just seemed to melt from their bodies as they moved. I loved the actor who played Alexey Vronsky,(his name escapes me at the moment) his eyes were so carnal, so lustful that you could see how much he wanted Anna (Kiera Knightly) and you couldn't very well blame her for falling into that trap. You could see in both of their eyes how much they wanted each other. Jude Law was excellent as the husband Alexey Karenin. He made me feel so bad and guilty, a guilt that passed on to Anna as she was torn up inside for what she was doing to him. Kiera Knightly gave a grand performance as the torn woman who ruined her life. The supporting cast also did really well with their characters. Sometimes the costumes in the movie outshine the acting but hey, they're still lovely to look at. In the end I think this is one of the better versions of the film, it doesn't really hit you when the inevitable happens, (but that may just be because I've seen just about every version and have read the book and its no longer shocking to me) but it does give it a good try at tugging at your tears.

75,JohnLeeT,Emily Watson Is the Saving Grace of this Disappointing Film,10,15 October 2013,"Although her role is quite small, Emily Watson is the sole reason to see this unsatisfying adaptation of the magnificent novel. The acting is uniform in its inadequacy, the direction dull and lifeless, and the entire film is lost in the shadow of the wonderful Garbo masterpiece. If only Ms. Watson could travel back in time and join her stunning gifts with those of Garbo! What a treasure that film would be. Unfortunately, other than Emily Watson's magnificent performance, this has only costume design to recommend it. However, Watson captures the essence of the period in her all-too-brief but magical turn. What a truly gifted artist she is! The way she brings to life her character is as if she actually lived in that time and simply stepped before the cameras from the Russia of old. It is a stellar, amazing wonder to watch her work her magic and save this film from being a complete and utter failure.

76,jacklmauro,Nearly Great. Nearly,7,3 March 2013,"This is Tolstoy deconstructed. It is hard to recall dialogue because there's very little - it's like AK as a gorgeous comic book. Then, much has been said about the theatrical staging. Never mind. It works. As for the actors, never a fan of Jude Law, I think he's very very fine here. So is Knightley, if you're prepared to dislike Anna. Vronsky is not right, but what the hell. All that's needed is for the affair to take off and plunge us into AnnaLand. What matters, ultimately, is what the film does, and it nearly succeeds as a brilliant exploration of the destructive power love can be. Highbrow reviews love to refer to the famous bashing of Anna by her society, and that's important, but what's central is Anna's confusion. Here - and what I value - is that you can understand her going a bit insane. She believes in marriage and duty, even as she tries to believe she can enjoy passionate love that is lasting, missing the reality that the passion and the shame feed one another. There's also subtle commentary here as to how a woman will suffer where no man will, although (ironically) Karenin comes far nearer to Anna's whirl of emotional despair than the baby-ish Vronsky. All of this mixed-up critique (and I confess it is) confirms my feeling; this is very close to being a great film because you think about love, and everything love does, afterward. Where does it go wrong? Almost no basis to Anna's character, and that's crucial in understanding her despair. No chemistry between Anna and Vronsky, and not enough exploration of Karenin, because his transitions are far more interesting than Anna's (which is another flaw). Still. In terms of what is out there, this is a great film. In terms of what it could have been, it gets close.",Anna Karenina
77,marydm-43470,"It outshines Old Leo, but for Knightley's teeth",8,14 October 2020,"Just like Bale struggling to speak through his teeth in the fabulous cinematic experience that is American Psycho, so too here, an absolutely original and daring take on that old classic archetypal melodrama that is Old Leo's Anna Karenina is ruined by Knightley's smile. An extravagant, visually stunning film, with the brilliantly original premise of life as theatre and theatre as life, a stylized feast that enhances the original novel and leaves all those BBC respectable staid dramatizations for dead, is unfortunately marred right in the middle with the most inappropriate casting of the two central characters. Vronsky is a milksop and popinjay rather than a sexually enticing character, and every time Knightley looks in his direction and smiles, the physical structure of her wide mouth and crooked teeth make her look like a slightly unhinged adolescent vampire rather than a grande dame who's just discovered her life's grand passion.
A terrible pity these two just don't fit in, in what is otherwise a glorious production, with way too many creative angles to mention here.
Suffice it to say that the original soap opera -lol, young girl spunk marries older socially respected coldish man, then falls in love with younger ""passionate"" mam, the usual tragedies ensure - that have given generations of lit undergrads such mirth, and made into a cinematic institution by countless big screen and small screen adaptations, is totally transformed here by the cinematic language employed. The formal setting of theatre, the operatic music, the crackling editing, costumes and cinematography to die for, are all just superlative. Leo would probably have a nervous breakdown watching his moralistic tale come so alive and injected with moral ambivalence and complexity he perhaps did not imagine.
While Vronsky and Anna are pretty ineffective due to the casting, almost every other character is absolutely the best ever. Mafaddyen as Oblonsky, Vikander as Kitty, Law as Karenin, all bring nuance to their characters no other iteration has managed. Despite the stylisation, they breathe complexity. I've never seen Karenin so nuanced before on the screen, so full of those human contradictions that made Brutus in Julius Caesar be ""with himself at war"". But the kudos go to Gleeson, the best ever, bar none, Levin. Indeed the conviction Vikander and Gleeson bring to the Kitty-Levin relationship totally eclipses the Vronsky-Anna one in humanity and emotion, despite their rather limited screen time.
Knightley has had her teeth straightened since, but her facial structure remains girlish rather than womanly, especially in her smile mode. If you don't mind that, do see the film for it has plenty of other cinematic satisfactions. It's kind of weird though, that a movie so obsessed with visual effect has a rather irritating visual image in Knightley's smile right in the middle.",Anna Karenina

79,jafar-iqbal,Bold reimagining of a Russian classic,7,18 September 2012,"It started with Pride And Prejudice, carried on with Atonement and, once again, Joe Wright has Keira Knightley acting in one of his films. He's moved away from the streets of old-time London though; instead, he's taken her to old-time Russia, and into one of the greatest novels all of time. This time, she's Anna Karenina. In, well, Anna Karenina! For people like me who haven't read the book, here's a quick little summary. Anna Karenina is one of many Russian socialites of the 19th century, flitting along in high society. She's married to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law), and has a son. But her life changes drastically when she starts an affair with the young but affluent Count Vronsky (Aaron Johnson).It's a straightforward enough story, nothing overly confusing. There are some other, slightly related, stories too, which bring forth the acting chops of people like Kevin Kline, Olivia Williams, Matthew Macfadyen and Emily Watson. To name a few. And here's the good news: they're all pretty good in it. Of the lot, I'd say Macfadyen – as Oblonsky – is the standout, but every actor pulls their weight for the good of the film. They all do well enough to keep the movie entertaining, without really setting the world alight. It's solid acting.I do have a gripe with that Keira Knightley woman though. Unlike popular opinion, I think she's a good actress. But she doesn't do herself any favours by playing that same stereotypical character she's played in so many of her other movies. The high-class well-to-do character with the perfect accent and conflicted feelings. Nobody makes conflicted look sexy the way she does, but it's been done by her so many times. It's a bit frustrating. Jude Law, on the other hand, gives such an un-Jude Law performance. I was very impressed.But I don't want to talk about the performances, because they're nowhere the best thing about this film. The best thing about it is the cinematography. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. I'm gonna try and explain this in the best possible way: it is as though you are watching a stage play. Everything is deliberately theatrical, with scene and costume changes. We see curtains rising and characters exiting through trap doors and up staircases. It's a very bold idea, and one Wright pulls off successfully.The real question for me is whether the movie's cinematography is enough of a reason to go see it. The performances are good, but not incredible. The story and script are good but, again, nothing spectacular. It's all solid enough, but it's the style of the movie that enhances it. In this case, I'd say you should go and see it. You won't be disappointed by the acting or the script, and you should hopefully be wowed by the direction.

81,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,An interesting take on AK marred by pretentiousness,7,18 September 2012,"I adore the novel, so I will be discussing Joe Wright's take on it and where it ranks amongst other adaptations but I will of course look at its merits as a film aside from the novel.As a whole adaptation, this version falls somewhere in the middle. Even without all the metatheatrical trappings, it still took an interesting and valid approach to the novel, proving that the novel could be adapted until infinity and it would still be fresh each time. As readers of the novel would know, there is much more to it than Anna's affair. Tolstoy did not write vague types: he wrote fully-fleshed characters, and Tom Stoppard's screenplay acknowledged Tolstoy's style. Therefore I don't want to condemn the film outright because that would overshadow the things that it does get right.Keira Knightley's version of Anna is not nearly as bad as you would think. She has the sense to restrain herself a little so that the many other elements of the novel shine through. She goes for the unsympathetic approach and it works. All her mannerisms that I generally find annoying- the schoolgirl smirking and rampant nymphomania- actually work for this role. This Anna takes Vronsky just because she can, and then ultimately regrets it. We can feel her frustration: she's young and wants to have fun but she's tied down to a stuffy older husband. In that sense, it's quite a modern interpretation, but not hideously so.Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky was just miscast. If the novel had been about Anna seducing a schoolboy, he would have been great, but Vronsky is meant to be a dashing man. The styling is atrocious- he looks like a seventies Scandinavian Eurovision entry. Wright seems to have told some of the actors to act realistic and some to play up to the stylised setting. Taylor-Johnson plays the artifice so much that he just comes off as camp and sleazy. The scene where he is about to ride Frou Frou is like a production of Equus and there's a love scene with Keira Knightley that brought to mind an old advert for Philadelphia cheese. Their revelation of love is also poorly dealt with. Anna has some kind of fantasy dream where the two have an ""erotic ballet"" and suddenly they're banging away, presumably now in the real world.Jude Law as Karenin. A bizarre choice when he could have played Vronsky five years ago and might even get away with it now at a push. However, he gives a performance that is probably his best. His Karenin is a bureaucrat through and through. Other adaptations have still made Karenin an attractive option. This Karenin is certainly not going to develop any great passion soon. We also see how he is manipulated by moral guardian Countess Lydia. If Law is trying to make a reputation as a serious actor, he's on the right path.And what about all that pretentious theatre stuff? It seriously slows down the pace in the first third but once you get used to it, you can just enjoy the film. The ending is rather abrupt (no, that famous ending is not the last scene) but quite poignant.",Anna Karenina
82,tgooderson,"Beautiful, Enchanting and Bold",9,8 September 2012,"Director Joe Wright's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel Anna Karenina is one of the most visually stunning and artistically bold films I've seen in quite some time. Wright places most of his plot within the confines of a dilapidated theatre and has his actors make use of the stage, stalls and behind the scenes areas when forming the sets of late Tsarist Saint Petersburg. Actors will walk from one part of the theatre to another with sets and costumes changing around them, all with the hustle and bustle of both a real theatre and lively city. It's a stylistic decision which was probably met with scepticism by studio bosses and the like but works incredibly well to bring to life the characters which themselves are so wonderfully written by Tolstoy.Joe Wright was lucky in a way in that he started off with a fantastic story, written by Tolstoy. This was then adapted by Oscar winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard who handed Wright and his cast a beautifully well crafted script which despite its complexities, rolls of the tongues of the talented cast. I have never read the source novel and have in fact never managed to finish any of the great works of Russian literature (the names don't help) so the plot was new to me. The themes of love, infidelity, trust and city vs countryside-life charge out of the screen and most are tackled very well. One area which I thought was slightly forgotten was the fascinating part of the plot regarding Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Levin is in love with an attractive and highly sought after young Princess, Kitty (Alicia Vikander). His tale of love, family, hardship and politics feels slightly brushed to one side which is a shame as his arc also points towards the social upheaval which would greet Russia in the coming decades.The first half of this film was probably my favourite half of any I've seen in the cinema this year. It whizzed along thanks to the dialogue, plot and interesting design. The problems that I have with some period dramas such as dull ideas and duller characters felt a million miles away as I watched, transfixed with a smile on my face. The highlight of the entire film for me was a ball in which some of the central characters danced. This was a scene full of careful manoeuvring, examination and lust as the two lovers become intimate for the first time. Onlookers watch on as Anna and Count Vronsky dance a waltz to an ever quickening pace. Kitty watches with horror as she sees the man she thought was hers slip away. The dancing itself is beautifully choreographed and came as close to art as I've seen dance be. Due in part to the nature of the story, the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the pace or intensity of the opening half but is nonetheless interesting, dark and impressive.There are three things which make Anna Karenina one of my favourite films of 2012 so far. The first is the story, the second is the direction and the third is the acting. Every single member of the cast dazzles here with not one actor giving a misjudged or poor performance. The standout for me is Jude Law whose mild mannered and restrained performance is simply incredible. He maintains grace and dignity despite having a terrible spell thanks to Anna and Law manages to convey all of his emotions in a similar understated way to Gary Oldman did with Smiley in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. He also makes the audience feel incredibly empathetic towards his character. For an actress I'm not particularly fond of, Keira Knightly has somehow found herself with two excellent central performances in two of my favourite films of the year; this and A Dangerous Method. She feels like the go-to-girl for this type of role and is excellent although my girlfriend rightly points out that when she smiles, she looks like she's about to cry. Aaron Taylor-Johnson also gives a good performance, despite comedy moustache, as the dashing lover. He is believable as the swarve and arrogant cavalryman but is outplayed by Law in later scenes. It's funny to think that ten years ago it would probably have been Jude Law in the Vronsky role but he has matured as an actor in recent years and can carry off a character like Karenin with aplomb. Another standout is Matthew Macfadyen who plays more of a comedy character but plays it gracefully. Domhnall Gleeson is also superb as Levin.Despite the great acting this is the director's film. The style is so bold that at first I was worried that it wouldn't work but to keep a city as vast as Saint Petersburg inside one theatre then having the rest of the world to play with outside the city was a fantastic idea which was pulled off with pinpoint precision. There are flaws, for instance it felt slightly too long and some areas weren't given as much attention as I'd have liked (two contradictory statements I know) but overall Anna Karenina is a enchanting film and one of the best I've seen so far this year.www.attheback.blogspot.com",Anna Karenina
83,SteveMierzejewski,A failed attempt at creativity,5,20 December 2012,"Could someone please explain to me why the director, Joe Wright, chose to film this as stage sets? That was bad enough, but then there is the choreographed dances by office workers with people playing tubas strolling around... I have one more question. Did the director read the book? I mean, this is a serious look at love, morals, and society. Tolstoy asked the big questions and tried to use novels to work out the answers. It certainly was no joke to him. Okay, I understand, this work has been made into films and TV dramas many times. Wright knew he needed a new approach. However, in my opinion, this just wasn't it. After watching the choreographed office scenes, I felt that I could no longer take the film seriously.I did not expect much from Keira Knightley, as I was afraid she would overact the role. However, she did all right. Not great, but all right. I've never been happy with any of the Annas in any of the adaptations. Garbo may have been the best. I have also never been happy with any of the Vronskys. In this adaptation, I was sad to see that Vronsky, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, was prettier than Anna. He was just too effeminate for me. I didn't see the charisma that he would have to possess in order to make an intelligent woman, like Anna, leave her family. The sense of a strong attraction between the two leads seemed lacking and, without this, the film loses credibility. There were a few touching moments, which is why I rated the film as high as 5, but, for the most part, the action left me, and most of the audience, unmoved.If you want to see some well-designed sets and costumes, I suppose you can go and watch this, but don't expect to find much depth here, and don't expect to find Tolstoy's novel. Actually, the best advice I can give is to read the novel again. Then, you can decide for yourself if this new adaptation has any merit.",Anna Karenina
84,NutzieFagin,Tolstoy's Scarlett Letter Novel,7,28 December 2012,"I have probably seen every Anna Karenia movie that was put out. Each actress playing the role has always done a slightly different portrayal of the character. Long time ago, I read this novel for a Russian Lit class and I have always likened it to the ""Scarlett Letter"". Same story about a woman who has a love affair and dares to challenge the morals of society. This movie seems to be a very different but neurotic adaptation of the other Anna Karenia movies.First, it opens up with a artistic arrangement by showing the props and scenes from a stage performers view. In other words, ""all the world is a stage and we are the actors"". A interesting take, but if you are first greeted by it without knowing the message, it can be highly disarming or confusing to the viewer. The acting is good. Keira Knightly who I've seen play nothing but pirate wenches gives a very passionate performance of an impulsive maybe slightly neurotic Anna Karenia. Her passionate affair with Vronsky saves her from a boring marriage but it drives her into paranoiac madness as well. Jude Law, with whom I was surprised to see in the role did a fine job as the cuckold husband, Karenen. I sympathized with his character as a husband who lacked any gravit tass whatsoever but followed his regimented lifestyle to the beat of a drum. But he loved and respected his wife in his own fashion. The other supporting characters who were to give a vision of a ""succesful life"" or existence added a fine spice to the social commentary of Tolstoy and Imperial Russian society.The costumes and music are quite pleasing and beautiful. Although, the ballroom scene which may have showed the frivolity and hypocrisy of proper Russian upper class society was slightly annoying and drawn out. But the movie should be nominated for costume designs and musical score.Russian Literture and Tolstoy lovers may enjoy the film, but I fear others who have not read the novel will be bored by it. But see it anyway--classic lit should not be missed!",Anna Karenina
85,banzanbon,"Disjointed, hyper and hollowed out",3,18 August 2013,"A seriously aimless and unaccountable pastiche of Baz Luhrman. The opulence is so overwhelming that it eats up the emotional gravitas of the story. I'm a fan of all the actors and Joe Wright but this film fails. The pace of the film and the often pointlessly soaring music are so busy that they kill off the character that Tolstoy was conveying about that era's languid upper class Russia. The characters are very haphazardly introduced and most of them come across as incidental and simply throwaway. The cinematography is beautiful, as are the sets and the costumes, but they also add to the confusion of the film. One can never figure out what the 'theatrical' factor of the whole decor is all about. Is it a play? Are these actors being watched as we watch the audience watching the actors? Are we, the film viewers inside the story, on stage with the actors and at the same time a part of the theater audience? It's never clear and it's repetitive interjection sticks out like a soar thumb within a viewer's attention.All in all, it's one very confused (slightly pretentious) and even at-times annoying movie of a very important story that should not have been 'impaired' in this manner.

All I could think was that she must have bipolar illness and had she not been so beautiful, those men would have dumped her long ago. By the time she suicided, I had lost all interest in and empathy for her. Also, in this particular film there are places in which the dialogue was so rushed and hushed I could not understand what was being said. Costumes were beautiful and scenery too.

Acting of entire cast was quite impressive. Keira succeeded bringing Anna's inner and social conflict about her extramarital relation.

I saw the movie yesterday afternoon in Paris and came out of the theater wondering why had I lost my money and time for such a nonsense. There is absolutely nothing in this film worth retaining. The director and his scenery designer took obviously an immense pleasure in presenting the story in a sophisticated setting making all they could to mislead the spectator especially if he has not read the novel! Aestheticism can be interesting to use but in limited amount If I may say so, too much make up on a beautiful face will make of it a horrifying masquerade and this is what happens here.Everything in this movie seems to come out from the glaciation ages!

90,God-12,You just long for the train to finally arrive to run her down,1,14 February 2013,"A masterpiece of postmodernism! This film succeeds in distilling, and then amplifying, everything that is wrong with Russian novels, whilst studiously avoiding contact with anything that is worthwhile.It focuses, relentlessly, on costumes, mannerism, and style, whilst ignoring, deliberately, all substance.Modern sensibilities are injected, forcibly, into every word spoken, every glance with no sympathy for the possibility that anything old fashioned could be good.It consists of juxtaposed clips - some quite good, some even quoting, ironically (if such humourless vitriol cloud be considered ironic) from Tolstoy.The set pieces are too wooden to be considered passable by a poor puppeteer.Part of the brilliance of the postmodernism is revealed by the money saved by not having a continuity editor so that it could be spent on clothes.The scriptwriter's contempt for history and the sensibilities and manners of the time is made clear in the deliberately anachronistic dialogue - where there is any dialogue.Transforming such a thoughtful, wordy, argumentative and carefully plotted novel into a series of disjointed, scenes, with no characterisation, let alone character development, puts Tolstoy in his place as the minor scribbler that he clearly was - particularly as he made no effort to write his novels in the style of the world's greatest authors, who, as we know write for Mills & Boon.The film, helpfully spares us any unnecessary suspense by returning to the theme of trains and train accidents regularly.After cutting from scene to scene with furious rapidity, the film spend considerable time on a game of Mahjong - no doubt to emphasise the Russianness.An example of the masterful subtlety is the long scene that has the dialogue 'my god, my god' followed by the slow raising of eyes to the heavens as the characters eventually grasp the import of the remark.If you want to get over all the pain of reading Russian novels in one go, and avoid the tedium of learning of the human condition, then this is precisely the film for you.'Count Vronsky, and I, love one another' Anna says helpfully at one stage - we'd never have suspected it otherwise.I hope never again to wish so earnestly for somebody to be run over by a train as soon as possible.",Anna Karenina
91,dbogosian-1,Swing and a miss,4,21 November 2012,"I've never read the book, but that should not have prevented me from enjoying this movie, as I normally love sumptuous productions such as this. The problem is that the director had some grand artistic vision which completely undermined the telling of the story. For the first half hour I was utterly confused because the story is presented through the artifice of a theater. Eventually the viewer realizes it's not a real theater, but everything that happens is presented in this surreal context, where outdoor scenes are contained in the theater. Visually it's striking, yes, but ultimately it defeats the purpose of storytelling. If the story doesn't have enough drama to hold your interest, then don't bother dressing it up with artifice. This story seems to have plenty of drama but it took a back seat to the presentation. In a way it's similar to what was done with ""Moulin Rouge"" but somehow that worked; this one just leaves you at first confused, then bored, then frustrated.On the positive end, costumes are phenomenal, and Keira's face lights up the screen every time she appears.",Anna Karenina
92,hotangen,Why bother filming Anna K when THIS is the result,1,27 November 2013,"What a disappointment. I was curious to see if Stoppard - a playwright and man of the theatre - and film director Wright could blend theatre (make believe) and film (another form of make believe) in order to expand the viewer's experience of this classic story. Now I know. Superimposing theatre into film, as done here, does not work. I suspect this was done to be different, which is not a good reason for doing it. However, I do think that 'Anna' would translate well to the stage as an opera, for all the elements necessary for a successful opera are in the story.A major problem with this film is Anna. In the film Anna is depicted as a modern woman, albeit in gorgeously reinterpreted period dress, and this diminishes her, makes her insignificant, small, and unimportant, just a woman unlike any other woman. But Tolstoy tells us that she is beautiful - physically, intellectually, aesthetically, spiritually, and as a humanitarian. She is a paragon of virtue. The actress and the film script give us a physically beautiful Anna, but nothing of her other qualities. We also get more than we need of the lovers expressing their physical passion, something Garbo was able to convey fully dressed.Another problem is Anna's husband, Karenin, as played by Law. He is softer and kindlier than Rathbone, and he's shown to be a good man, especially in the closing scene, but it was wrong to make his face, in frequent closeups, so completely inexpressive, and to make him so boring as a person, and so repellent as a husband/lover. And then there's Anna's lover, with his blond fright wig. Whatever did Anna - who now realizes she is starved for sexual love - see in this lounge lizard that she would abandon her beloved child and her place in society just to be with him.The scene between Anna and Karenin after Anna has given birth to Vronsky's child is memorable. On her deathbed Anna sends a note to Karenin begging him to come and forgive her. He does so. Soon after, when she has recovered, Karenin reminds her she begged for his forgiveness. Anna replies that she did so thinking that she was dying, in effect saying that now she doesn't need or want his forgiveness. I haven't checked this scene with the novel, but shocking as it is, it seems truthful to human behavior.The parallel love story of Kitty and Levin is successfully translated to the screen. I especially liked the scene where they confess their mutual love in a game where they move the scrabble letters to spell out their thoughts and feelings for one another, a scene which is very sensual and moving.There are bits and pieces of this film to like, but overall, it is hugely disappointing.",Anna Karenina
93,p-seed-889-188469,...and the award for best actor in Anna Karenina goes to....the horse,1,13 March 2015,"Before I begin my review I would like to thank the previous renters of the DVD who left a big scratch on the disc which meant it ceased to play half way through, thus providing a diplomatic way of bringing this execrable effort to an end well before its running time. I can only imagine this scratch was caused by them flinging the disc at high speed across their living room, as I was sorely tempted to do. To be honest the only possible use for this DVD is as a frisbee or for practising skeet shooting.Let me confess. I have not read Anna Karenina. Ironically, like the movie, I made it half way through before giving up. Call me a peasant but unlike the more literary inclined I don't have orgasms over it, it is a very ordinary story about a very unappealing and stupid woman. I enjoyed learning more about that period of Russia when the beginnings of communism were stirring, and the debates about feudalism, mechanization of agriculture, etc, but frankly the whole thing could have done with a few sleigh chases or the tossing about of Molotov cocktails (just kidding...I think). So I have no axe to grind about the movie being true to the book or capturing the essence or supposed ""greatness"" of it. Anna Karenina has already been filmed about a hundred times so you might well ask why bother. Personally I have no objection to doing a remake that brings ""old"" subjects to the attention of new audiences, and it is not unreasonable for remakes to try and bring its subject nearer perfection than its predecessors. But why, in the name of all the collective Gods, would you try and present a famous novel in some bizarre context just for the sake of being different? This version, which attempts to portray the novel in the context of a theatre, makes about as much sense as making a remake of ""Saving Private Ryan"" on ice. I didn't think it was possible to be more pretentious than the literary types who fawn over Anna Karenina and its ilk and who think they are making important contributions to civilisation by writing theses on subjects like ""The impact of snipe shooting in 1870's Russia to women's rights in Nigeria"". Imagine my surprise to find that the makers of this film have taken such pretentiousness to levels previously thought impossible. The ""production"" aside, the acting is just appalling. It doesn't help that the actor who plays Vronsky looks the spitting image of Eric Idle from Monty Python. It is probably not a good thing in what is supposed to the romance of all time when your audience bursts out laughing every time the ""hero"" makes an appearance. I kept waiting for a tirade on cheese or a soliloquy on dead parrots but regrettably they never came. The Vronsky of the book may be a dandy but he is not the prat that the film makes him appear. The Anna of the book is a mature woman, of solid build whose chief claim to fame is charisma rather than beauty. Kiera Knightly fails on all counts. Levin is a mature person not the teenager he is in the film. None of them can say their lines to save themselves. There are only 3 characters that escape this fiasco with their reputations intact. One is the girl who plays Kitty who is sweet and beautiful and true to character. Another is Levin's brother's ""wife"" who regrettably we see for only a few seconds and then in the gloom. And the third is the horse, Frou Frou, who has fine acting chops and never fluffs his lines. Otherwise, there is more ham in this movie than a bacon factory. I note other reviewers call the production ""bold"" and ""audacious"". Personally the words I would use are ""atrocious"" and ""self indulgent"". I would avoid this DVD like the plague, unless you are looking for an expensive coaster, or something to put under a table leg to stop it wobbling.",Anna Karenina

95,knowyourmovie,"Bearable, original at times, but overall unremarkable interpretation of the Tolstoy's classic novel ...",7,14 January 2013,"The 2012 movie ""Anna Karenina"" featuring world famous stars Keira Knightley and Jude Law is yet another adaptation of the classic novel with the same name completed by Leo Tolstoy in 1877.The first question that I asked myself even before seeing the movie in the theatre was ""Why do we need one more adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"" when so many worthy interpretations of the timeless novel are readily available to satisfy our curiosity?""Between all the numerous big screen efforts as well as multiple British, Russian, and even Cuban TV series, radio dramas, ballets, musicals, and ten operas (!), has there been anything truly new and original left to say about the tragic life of the mysterious Anna Karenina and all those profoundly unlucky individuals who had a terrible misfortune of being close to her - her husband, her lover, and her children?The trailer for 2012 movie does not take ""no"" for an answer and boldly announces an intriguing ""bold new vision"" that the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" apparently contains.After seeing the movie it still remains a mystery to me what kind of ""bold new vision"" the trailer was exactly referring to. Or was it just another deceiving marketing gimmick? It was probably the latter, since a truly visionary movie has no need to explicitly spell it out in a large font in a trailer.It is not that the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" is a bad movie. In fact, it is more than bearable and even contains a small number of interesting accents as well as certain notable scenes, some of which are rarely included in the big screen adaptations.Nevertheless, the overall amount of the groundbreaking material that the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" offers to our attention is not even remotely enough to justify yet another attempt to bring the Tolstoy's novel to the big screen. In addition, the movie features some questionable cost-cutting production decisions that only aggravate the overall lack of authenticity quite noticeable in the 2012 version.Summing it up, contrary to the promises made in a trailer, what was good in the 2012 movie was not bold or new, and what was bold or new was not so good.The acting in the movie, while overall acceptable, was again not strong enough to warrant creating one more ""Anna Karenina"" big screen adaptation.To those who admired Keira Knightley's performance as Anna Karenina I would simply suggest comparing it with some truly remarkable performances from the past.Why is that when I watch Vivien Leigh as Anna Karenina, I completely believe that she is a Russian aristocrat and a member of the highest society circle and the Keira Knightley's acting strikes me as completely inauthentic? Obviously, Vivien Leigh with her aristocratic upbringing and noble beauty was a natural choice for the role. I do not think that one needs to be a high aristocrat to notice something equally obvious - Keira Knightley's performance, while admittedly stylish, does not have anything even remotely aristocratic in it.When her Anna exchanges glances with her love interest, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), they look more like two unsophisticated youngsters lustfully winking at each other in a bar, than refined members of two grand aristocratic families taken aback by the forbidden but irresistibly luring feelings towards each other dangerously quickly arising in their hearts.On the positive side, the 2012 movie avoided a regrettable mistake made in many of the ""Anna Karenina"" adaptations – furnishing the Count Vronksy character with a deeper, more sophisticated, more mature, and overall more attractive personality that he actually possesses in the Tolstoy's novel.Jude Law's performance as Anna's unloved and ultimately deceived husband is a mixed bag. On one hand, his acting is one of the best in the movie. On the other hand, if you compare his Karenin with the earlier interpretations by Nikolai Gritsenko (1967), Ralph Richardson (1948), Paul Skolfield (1985), or Basil Rathbone (1935), the outcome in my opinion will be not in favor of Jude Law whose performance would be suddenly perceived as lacking both depth and substance.Despite being mostly critical in my review, I still find myself happy that the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" actually happened and received a considerable publicity.The main reason for my favorable disposition towards the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" is my conviction that in the search for a true value of this movie we should look outside of the high art dimension and focus more on its utilitarian role - an important cultural role the movie could play by unobtrusively educating the younger generations of moviegoers.Let us be reasonable - with all the easily digestible nonsensical popcorn blockbusters written by illiterate but prolific Hollywood mediocrities, who from the Millennial generation in their right mind would decide to watch the black and white 1935 ""Anna Karenina"" with Greta Garbo not to mention the 1967 Russian version, even if the English subtitles for it are readily available on YouTube?However, if you widely announce a new adaption with an intriguing ""bold new vision"", add to the mix the world-famous stars like Keira Knightley and Jude Law and cleverly market the movie to the target audience, a chance that some Millennial or even someone from Generation X would become interested in the timeless story of poor Anna Karenina would suddenly jump from a hopeless absolute zero to a small, but statistically significant number.In conclusion, while I cannot call the 2012 ""Anna Karenina"" a must-see movie, I still believe that watching it would be beneficial for most of us.Those who have read the original Tolstoy's novel or have seen the earlier ""Anna Karenina"" interpretations would satisfy their understandable curiosity. Those who have no idea who Anna Karenina is and what the movie is all about, will get a rare opportunity to repair an educational gap in a quite entertaining way.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Anna Karenina
96,italo505,No pity for Karenina,8,22 January 2013,"You either love or hate Anna Karenina. Set in the late 19th century, Anna Karenina is one of the most elite and astonishing young women of Russia's high society and married to Alexi Karenin (Jude Law), a well to do gentleman with kind eyes yet an old fashioned, stern demeanor towards her. Everything is fine and dandy until Anna to visit her brother and sister-in-law in Moscow and stumbles upon Count Alexi (Nowhere Boy's Aaron Taylor Johnson), dressed up in a dashing white officer uniform that leaves a lasting impression.Up until that point I'm with Anna. I understand that she's a young, pretty lady feels trapped in a cold, loveless marriage so some flirting is excusable. As the story develops, Anna comes back to her husband without falling into any sexual escapades, just harmless stares and chance encounters with the young officer. However, Count Alexi won't give up until he gets Anna, one way or another and that's where things get really complicated.I love the way in which Joe Wright sets every scene inside a theatre, as if we are witnesses of a stage play in motion. We see sets being lifted, crew moving props left and right, changing the whole scenery in a split moment right in front of the camera, making you feel part of a live audience. And I loved every minute of it. I felt as if I was part of the production and had me anticipating where they would take us next.I'm particularly fond of the waltz scene during a ball in which Anna and Count Alexi engage in dance, in front of dozen of wondering eyes, until the crowd disappears. It's such a powerful and intimate performance, such an explosive chemistry that we understand why Anna does what she does next and gives in to her desires that cost her her marriage, her home, her reputation. I give the movie props for originality and great costumes, I hope we get more directors as bold and artsy as Joe Wright who, by the way, directed Keira Knighley before in Atonement and Pride and Prejudice. There is a bit of an obsession with Keira and her director though, almost overkill, to the point where it seems as if we're watching another of her lush Chanel commercial in motion.Where the story falls for me is when Anna Karenina gets way too obsessed with her lover to the point that she loses all self control and regard for anyone but herself. Not only does her poor husband learn about the affair but he also forgives her and gives her numerous chances to fix her cheating ways. He warns her that being a divorcée in this society is unforgivable and she's pretty much signing her own death sentence. Yet she keeps the affair going until she gets pregnant and pretends that she can have both her husband and her lover hold hands, you heard right, hold hands, people!!! Sorry, Anna, but you cannot have your cake and eat it, too!!! That's where I drew the line with her. I could care less whether she later gets dissed by everyone while attending a horse race featuring Count Alexi as one of the riders. Everyone stares at her with disdain and disapproval. I ended up rooting for Mr. Karenin from that moment forward and could really care less about his selfish wife.The story, written by Leo Tolstoy, has been heralded as the most beautiful love story ever written and I must agree with that statement. Love has so many faces that we see here as in the love profused by two passionate lovers, the love in Karenin's eyes when he watches over his children, even if one of them is not even his, the love in the parallel story of Levin and Kitty whose love grows as Anna Karenina's deteriorates. The love of a lover. The love of a parent. The love of a friend. Love that conquers all obstacles, a love that is blind, a love that is pure.",Anna Karenina
97,hedin_88,Very hard to watch.,3,29 January 2013,"I understand the awe of the people who have read and fallen in love with the novel. Im a literature major myself but this piece of work never was my genre. Russian realism is full of details, very eloquent and very very emotional. And that's what this movie is as well. Only those who like the novel will find some joy in its depiction on screen but for others this will be a very long experience. Overreactions, to much drama around acting, to much emphasizing pain and despair and hate makes this movie painful and desperate and hated. Its a movie that focuses a lot on overemphasis the hard life and along the way you will loose sympathy for the characters and just wait for it to end so you can get on with your life. Ladies in their 40's and 50's might find it touching and emotional, but that is all. Its just not speaking to the audience.",Anna Karenina
98,seeingbystarlight,"""I'm like a starving beggar who's been given food.""",3,12 March 2021,"This said by the title character to her lover, minutes before that crucial horse racing scene, in which she so painfully reveals just how hard she's fallen for him.It's a line of dialogue which so describes their relationship in so many different ways, you almost don't even have to see the movie.I've seen Anna Karenina portrayed three times.First by Greta Garbo who plays the role with dignity and composure.Even in the scenes of great passion with Alexey Vronsky, she's always regal and dettached even in places that
demand her to be pathetic.She kills herself not so much because of the affair gone wrong but because all she values has been lost. She will never see her son again. And society has permanently shunned her. She's made a terrible mistake. And now she can never take it back.Next I've seen her played by Sophie Marceau, who plays the role like a tragic heroine. Fragile. Unable to cope. Sustained by a substantial amount of fantasy about her new lover. When that fantasy collapses so does she. And she becomes a martyr. Killing herself when her illusions go up in smoke. The price of living in a dream.Keira Knightley plays her like an unhappy, pampered princess on the verge of a nervous breakdown.Her affair with Alexey pushes her right over the edge.
A short trip for her.Everything from her swept up hair, to her jewelry, to her gowns which are always slightly off the shoulder, suggest a woman about to collapse...And then she does. Into the arms of an officer who accepts her love with a sort of bored resignation, as if he already knows where it's all going. No chance he loves her the way that she loves him.To it's credit, the movie does a better job of casting Vronsky than the 1997 version. I never believed Sean Bean for one second in the role. This guy, while he's not believable as being in love with Anna, at least does a decent job of explaining why she's so madly in love with him.Knightley infuses her character with a sort of insane desperation, which is obvious throughout the entire movie.
From her ecstatic embracing of the affair at the beginning, to her hopeless abyss of despair at the end, it really is all about Alexey.
She's the only one of the three Kareninas who kills herself because she loved and lost.",Anna Karenina
99,Loving_Silence,"It's beautiful to look at, but.....",3,16 October 2012,"It's ultimately hollow. The art direction, set pieces, cinematography, costume design are all superb, the film is a technical marvel. But my compliments for the most part end right there. Sadly, there were far too many themes for a two-hour film to broach. Unfortunately, ""Anna Karenina"" never hits any sort of stride where the narrative arc is concerned. The dark side of love is ruminated upon, sure, but there's never any real payoff. The film faces the dilemma of a thousand book adaptations before it – it's too small in scale to offer the epic rewards of the written word, but too large on-screen to hide from its glaring shortcomings. Solid visual moments aren't enough to sustain an audience, and Joe Wright's visual style isn't enough to salvage gaping wounds in the story.In this bizarre version, adapted by Tom Stoppard (""Shakespeare in Love"") and directed by Joe Wright (""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Atonement""), the tragedy unfolds in a huge, magnificent theater. As the curtain rises, the performance commences and various players fall in and out of love – with little moral meaning. On-stage, backstage and on catwalks, they change partners and pirouette, always self-consciously aware of the impression they're making. Thus Joe, a filmmaker by trade, sought to preserve the novel's mystique and cultural exclusivity by aping an altogether less inclusive medium; one that remains inaccessible to the hordes, and which, like Tolstoy's oeuvre, is considered to be a retreat, a sanctuary if you will, for the intelligentsia, who must endure the witless prattling and half-bakery of the mass at all other times. The film will undoubtedly be a big competitor in the Oscars in the technical categories. But Best Screenplay, Picture, Director, I don't think so.6/10",Anna Karenina
100,jlj9675-1,poor,2,20 December 2012,"I thoroughly disliked this version of the story. The very presentation, mostly within one theater and stage setting was distracting to say the least. The brief interludes of actual scenery were lovely but far too few and short. Some of the dialog was somewhat muffled, resulting in misidentification of a few characters, initially. I can't imagine whose idea this was but I'm not surprised to read of the fine actors who turned it down after reading the concept. The characters who elicited an emotional reaction from me were Kitty and Constantin; those actors were so real that I was moved to tears by the depth of their facial expressions and vocalizations. I felt the nudity was totally unnecessary and the depiction of smoking just silly. I looked forward to this remake but was sorely disappointed and cannot in all good conscience recommend it to anyone.",Anna Karenina
101,mcampbelljh1,Completely new approach to a classic story that makes it come alive again,10,1 December 2012,"Review: Anna Karenina 2012Completely New approach, for a classic story What makes this a great movie, which in my opinion will be nominated for many academy awards is the approach taken by director Joe Wright. He chose to hire great actors/actresses who could and did carry the production. The acting was all, not the set, not special effects, but the success of this production was in the superb acting by all the major stars: Keira Knightley (Excellent in every respect, she played the perfect Anna. Definitely best actress is due), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (a new heart throb that will sweep into and melt any woman's heart with those expressive eyes, who also nailed the role as the perfect lover and indulged self-assured aristocrat), Jude Law (such a different role for him, yet he pulled it out perfectly as well, cold removed from life so one understood why Anna would long for Vronsky), Matthew Macfaden (who one remembers from Pride and Prejudice, perfectly played the irresponsible, indulged brother), Alicia Vikander (Another new adorable actress, who gave life to the beautiful, innocent Kitty), Domhnall Gleeson (who brought sympathy to the role of Levin), Kelly Macdonald (the perfect demure wife of the unfaithful Oblonsky).. I have to say it again it was the superb acting that carries this film without which it would be nothing, and the director's use of symbolism that makes this an amazingly new adaptation of a classical story we all know.This movie will not be the biggest box office draw. It will take a certain type of audience to appreciate it... Anyone with any level of culture and artistic understanding will see how it creates something beautiful and entirely new with a very old story line. It has a bare minimal set (I think deliberately to focus on the acting). It uses symbolism to convey the lack of set decor and production excess. The reason the set is not missed is the excellent acting from each and every actor/actress associated with the production they worked together like clockwork, executing the storyline like I've never seen before (and I've seen at least 3 version of this in film). But it was the directing that put together the perfect mix of symbolic and real life, to maximize the effect of each actor/actress while taking an old story line and making it come alive again in an entirely new way. I know some men will call it a chick flick (and it probably will be more liked by woman and the educated enlighten males of the day. The young so use to pizazz and special effects might not find it fast paced enough; None of that matters as it is a masterpiece of acting and directing that will make this movie a shoe-in for the next academy award best film of the year and the most memorable adaptation of Anna Karenina to date.

I understand that was the vision of the director but it just didn't work. It just felt incredibly heavy-handed and disingenuous.

Best thing about Russian novels are detailing in beautiful way, thou I m not a native Russian, I have read the English/Tamil translated books.

It is a bit over dramatic but thats what you expect with these big love storiesI enjoyed the setting in Russia, its a very original film, and a style you have to get used to, but the film does work, if you keep up with it, the film gets more interesting.I probably would not watch it again as it is a bit heavy and sad, but overall i would say it is worth a watch and is a fairly good movie with substance and lots of emotion.",Anna Karenina
108,kos-27,visual feast of the Russian soul,10,17 January 2013,"Anna Karenina is maybe the most ideal piece of literature to be tried a new approach upon because it's a well known story with already numerous movie adaptations of it. Director Joe Wright must have had the same idea when he decided to create his version of the story. For me this is his best work to date.This movie - almost as bold as Dogville - takes on a theatrical approach for its adaptation. This approach is being disapproved by a lot of people along with it being too beautiful and therefore shallow and empty.Why is that? Isn't an artist supposed to look for new ways of expression? Isn't art allowed to be beautiful? In a normal environment such a story can not really live without being perceived as unrealistic. Therefore it's being set up in the theater. Theatre is drama, feelings, exaggeration. It permits us to feel - even be part of the Russian soul"". There is a dynamic boost by constantly moving cameras, moving scene changes, frames flowing into one another like a giant river of dance.There is not too much dialog. Only the necessary. Everything else is visual, either expressed through the dynamics of theater scenery or the acting. Colors are of essential importance - every dress that Anna wears has its own symbolism and reveals her mood o her state of mind. The actors represent exactly what they should. Yes, Vronsky is irritating, but he should be because his immature and sunny boyish nature is one of the reasons for this tragedy.Everything is drama, everything is contrast, the colors tell the fate of the two love stories, one that starts highly and collapses and the other that starts timidly but ends triumphantly.I was overwhelmed by the beauty of this movie. I want to watch it again and again.",Anna Karenina

110,cinemabon,When is a Russian play...,1,27 August 2013,"When is a Russian play more like an English drawing room drama? When it's ""Anna Karenina!"" Presented with more English accents than ""Downton Abbey,"" this version of the famous Russian novel by Tolstoy - called by William Faulkner as ""the greatest novel ever written"" – hardly does a novel with such an illustrious title justice. This version's style (as a play instead of a natural setting) and its acting (East End drama with actors spouting perfect Oxfordian English) leave one wondering what Tolstoy had in mind – not this soapy opera as this film presents. Assuredly, if one bothers to do such things as read a novel, then you begin to realize that Tolstoy had a great deal in mind when he wrote this prior to the only novel he considered he ever wrote, ""War and Peace."" The Soviet version, shot in 1967, is far better in its presentation and dramatization than this British version could ever attempt to be. However, you will have your contemporaries who accept anything current and decry films from the past as too stilted (acting is so much better today than it was then). Not always. ""Anna Karenina"" is proof of that.",Anna Karenina
111,onewhoseesme,A Very Creative Effort,8,23 June 2013,"I once asked Dustin Hoffman if he had any favorite movies or actors. He replied that he had favorite performances. Referring it seemed, to much smaller periods within a film. There are several shots where Keira is picture perfect, but this role was not for her. This performance ruins our memory of her former success under Joe Wright. Especially her first, which is her most unforgettable. Black Swan did the same for Natalie Portman, another of our cinema sweethearts. Which I walked out of. Her part here needed to be much deeper and more complex, but instead it was shallow and trite. The way Anna was portrayed was out of place. Whether by acting or writing I don't know. Either way it was a mistake. All of the male leads, four at my count, complemented each other perfectly and were well done. Some surprising cameos among the women. I didn't see it at the theater after hearing about the stage within the movie technique, which has actually been done in a few good movies. I didn't see it as a problem. The recent film Anonymous about Shakespeare began this way, as do others based on plays of his. Julie Taymore in her solo attempt to put Titus on film blended styles while injecting modern means and mechanism into near ancient settings, and pulled it off very smartly. Both of these were good films and highly worth watching. I point this out as there were many complaints about it in other reviews. It isn't the blending of the modern and the ancient, or the use of multiple styles in itself that is a problem. It's more a question of whether it works, and how well it was done. I believe here it does. Peter Greenaway excels at this kind of film making. We sometimes forget how shallow we have become as a society. What a melange and patchwork our culture is. Are we surprised it shows up in our films. There are some moments of clarity in the movie that are almost bewitching. While others present motion picture as painting or poetry. Some very good transitions. Overall I believe it to be a very creative effort. It is a blending of choreography, stage, and cinema with a desire to please the eye and entertain our emotions. It was only the moral ambiguity and modern sensibilities between the two lovers I found contemptible. Both of them being out of time and out of place. Love is the great conquerer of lust. As lust is the great destroyer of love. I believe the author intended this to be about the second. It is a mistake to think movies from books should be the book. Just as it is wrong for an amoral people to replace the beliefs of a moral people . . with their own. Especially when borrowing or telling their stories. One of the great enjoyments for all lovers of period pieces is going back to a time when people knew morality and understood what it was, and most agreed with it. Whether or not they actually were moral is entirely . . another story.http://fullgrownministry.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/covet/",Anna Karenina
112,blowfly13,horrible from beginning to end,1,19 August 2013,"I was praying for Anna to throw herself under the train. That's how untragic this tragedy was.Why do I keep watching movies with Keira Knightley? She gets to play some of the most amazing female parts ever in classic literature, and she plays them all the same way: feisty, 20th century b**ch. Lizzy in Pride and Prejudice - charming, funny - Keira plays her as a b**ch. Anna Karenina - insecure, weak, selfish - Keira plays her as a b**ch. There was some movie about a duchess that I could only bear a few minutes of, but it seemed to be the same - Keira plays her as a b**ch. And that huge jaw of her! And the evil looking eyes! And the scrunchy smile! It's all so distracting. She's such an odd looking person. It sounds insane to say a movie with Christopher Reeves was any good, but I saw Anna Karenina with him and Jacqueline Bisset and liked it so much more. Or at least I liked Jacqueline Bisset so much more. She played AK in such a vulnerable way, rather than the hard enamel surface you always get with Keira.The directing of this movie as a play was just horrendous. It was so distracting and removed any possibility of feeling any emotion toward the play or characters (if Keira and Vronsky's foppish mophead hadn't already done that). And the twisting of the story to make Anna BRAVE - one of the characters really said that - are you kidding? A woman who cheats on her husband, gives up her son for her lover, becomes so insecure that she drives him crazy, throws herself under a train - what was the brave part? She was totally selfish, and totally amoral. I find nothing to admire in Anna Karenina, the book, but she was SOMEWHAT tragic. The way this movie has her, and Keira plays her, she's just an intolerable, in your face, well, I've already given the epithet a few times.",Anna Karenina
113,sepial,Ingenious,10,12 January 2013,"This film provided me with the most pleasant surprise, as I hadn't read nor heard anything about it and had gone seeing it because of the source matter and the cast. The surprise came with the film's major strength, its main concept. Already after the first minutes the - excuse the, surely groan-some, comparison - somewhat Gondryish choice for an untidy backstage that provides the most fluent opportunity for gliding scenery changes felt as if there couldn't be a better way to bring this drama to the screen. and with the means a very welcome light-hearted air blew in for the first half. The never pretentious, continuously surprising style of the narration was completed by a line-up of superb actors at their best; one of my personal favourites here being Matthew Macfadyen, who really shined. This is not alone a well working attempt of bringing a heavy piece of literature to the screen, not just costume drama, but an innovative, energetic, at times almost surreal adventure into the ways how.

114,ursulahemard,"a stylised caricature of the book, a sort of humoristic variation on a theme",5,20 March 2013,"Well, to my own surprise, I actually did not think that it was bad :-PWhat I liked the most is that every scene (with the exception of the shagging) was taken from the book. There were even dialogues quasi word by word from the book. So no literary distortions nor added directors' fantasies in the plot. And I honestly very much do appreciate that!!! Unfortunately the book is 800 pages and therefore many scenes were left out, that's why for someone who has not read the book, the movie seems to be randomly cut together. But it's not, it's just that important scenes and characters are missing in between the scenes from the movie (let's say about 2/3 of the book :-)) which would actually explain the character development and links. Also, there is no time to incorporate the questioning of all the social political aspects and feudalism as well as religion, ethics and the meaning of life, which are constantly reoccurring themes in the book. It was the time boiling up to the uprising. And the question about women's rights and duties, etc.The movie is a stylised caricature of the book, a sort of humoristic variation on a theme, but in a charming way. The juxtaposing of the narrative in a theatre with the real-life shots, is clearly hinting from the very start that this movie is setting the plot 'on stage' and I thought that it was quite cleverly made. Also, costumes, sets and sound are all 21st century exaggerations of 19th century Russia, nothing authentic, but without falling into tasteless kitsch. The dancing at the ball was pretty hilarious because it did not seem to me pretentious but rather burlesque. The movie-making is obviously influenced by Baz Luhrman and MTV, etc., seems to be in fashion now...The characters were age-wise rightly cast, and were 'novel-conform' directed. I'm not a fan of Keira Knightly, and I have always seen Anna as someone more settled, soft, dreamy, calm, sophisticated, sensual, voluptuous, smart, witty and a tad cynical with a hint of haughtiness (and KK does not exactly fit). I preferred Sophie Marceau, but unfortunately she played in a movie-version where the entire story got changed. Reading the book I very much liked Oblonsky despite being a philanderer, but he comes out in the movie rather as a clown, saying that I thought that Matthew Macfadyen did a brilliant job. I can't stand Levin in the novel, but he turns out to be the 'good' guy in the movie (which is nonsense for he's very conservative, seigniorial, superior, ignorant, against invention and can't stand babies, etc. in short, a very boring man) ...but probably only if you haven't read the book.... I loved the scene when Levin is proposing to Kitty through the letter-game...exactly like in the book!Jude Law was very good as Karenin, but here again, by having omitted some important dialogues from the book between Karenin and other people, his character does not reveal much in the movie... shame.To cut it short, there are three different kind of marriages/love depicted in the book to observe and discuss. In the movie we get a glimpse of 2 but are predominantly focusing on Anna & Vronsky. It's not exactly what Tolstoy wanted, that's why the book is 800 pages. In the book, in the end, the question is left unanswered, for the definitions of 'love', 'loving' and the values of marriage are very individual and incomparable. The movie puts the main protagonists in a bad light and sends the message that the 'surviving' couple is the 'real' one, which in my opinion is humbug. It's none's right to judge. So that left a bitter taste in my mouth, but the movie was made for the mass-market and probably with a hidden religious message of morals to the innocent public...this is not very elaborate... but I thought the movie was enjoyable, a one-time entertainment, but better to read the book first!",Anna Karenina
115,love_for_nails,"Really clever, bold and beautiful!",10,14 December 2012,"These are the perfect words to describe this movie. Although I admit at first when I saw the movie, with all theater background I was a bit confused and I almost disliked it, but as the movie progressed I got into the story and by the end I really liked it. It's something new. The director is a really bold person, for choosing this background and for this type of adaptation. I saw both ""Atonement"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" the last one being the most fine movie of 2005 and the most beautiful adaptation of the novel for a movie.I understand why he chose to cast Keira again as the leading role. She is a fantastic actress no matter what others say. Well some others, because they aren't many. I disagree with some people that said that Alicia Vikander that played Kitty would have made a better Anna Karenina. On the contrary. I considered Alicia a bit dull, not very captivated in the atmosphere, and at some times bored. Kitty was in love with Vronsky, and she was very hurt when she heard about the affair. Alicia should have showed that more. She was very sweet and good nonetheless for the rest of the movie, but not so interesting as it praised. Keira Knightley was a perfect Anna Karenina. She played with so much love and passion her character that I really empathized with her. Her distress and sadness caught me by the end of the movie that I almost cried when her character committed suicide. As for Aaron Taylor-Johnson as others said maybe was not the Vronsky from the book, but it was the Vronsky for this movie. In this movie Vronsky was portrayed as an immature, young and unexperienced lover that , not that he wasn't willing to fight for Anna, but was rather (at some points not all) afraid of the situation. Honestly in that century's society, even because of love, you are not doing any good for the woman you love by allowing her into this mess. Anna acted typical for the woman in that period sacrificing everything for Vronsky, because she was silly and unhappy, but if Vronsky thought more wisely of the situation he would have protected Anna from all this circus. Practically Vronsky is showed here as someone very reckless and stubborn who didn't act in the right way at the right moment, with all the tempest around him. Aaron was a good actor. He really was. He is not a bad actor, not a great one either because he is still young, but is doing a nice job. And it was not his fault for portraying the beloved Vronsky in that way, it was the script and probably the director that told him to act like this. But he was not supposed to be liked. Jude Law, was supposed to be liked as Karenin, showing that in the end, he is the only one that cared for Anna with all the shame she brought upon him. Although he was mad at Anna and forbid her to see her child, he realized about Anna's situation and felt sorry for her. He was willing to help her but she refused, and with this decision her miserable life started. In the end, after her death he raised her child with Vronsky, which was a very sweet and wise thing, because he realized the child had no fault and in this way he apologized to Anna. Jude Law acted great as well.And last but not least, the soundtrack was wonderful, the costumes were stunning, I really wish it will win an Oscar for Best Costume Design, because it deserves it. It was a great movie and stunning for its cinematography. Something new and refreshing. I really enjoyed it. I empathized very much with the characters despite what some others critics said. They are wrong. It's a wonderful production. And I was not the only one who thought that. At the end of the movie in my cinema the audience begun to clap and were praising it until I reached the exit.Clever, bold and beautiful!

116,anthonyehler,Handsome production that could have used more charm,7,22 February 2014,"I wasn't expecting to be swept away in this movie. In many ways, it reminded me of a musical – like Joel Schumacher's 'Phantom of the Opera' – without the music. The movie is framed by the conventions of a stage play – with the elaborate props, machinery etc. seen by the audience. At first, I found this a bit fussy and distracting, but it was so superbly done, I was enchanted. It was also a clever way to distil Leo Tolstoy's epic story into just over two hours. The dance scene, at the first ball, was a neat shorthand for the budding passion between lovers. The story also gives you a pervasive sense of society's pressure on Anna without being obtrusive. Script, perfect. Music, perfect. And I loved the use of colour. Vronsky's angelic whites and princely blues reminded me of Frederic March's incarnation of the seductive count. Darker colours – red, blacks etc. – on Anna acted as a portent of what was to befall her in the end. Jacqueline Durran deserved her Oscar. The only draw back in using the theatrical device was a lack of empathy for the characters. It did, in places, seem a bit bloodless.",Anna Karenina
117,livstrongeva,You won't get it if you haven't read it,6,25 August 2013,"For those who have not read the book it might be quite hard to understand every detail. Why is that, you may ask? Anna Karenina's story takes up 8 books written by Russian writer Tolstoy. In order to put 800 pages full with growing drama into a two hour movie, it requires to take only the most important parts and a lot of things, story twists were left out. If you have read the book, it is easy to fill the gaps. But for a friend of mine who was watching without reading the book it was hard to follow.The making of the movie as a play was in my opinion a very good decision as it allowed to see many scenes happening at the same time. That is also one of the characteristics of the books - there is a lot going on at the same time. There are even nine main characters who have their own lives and goals. But of course, all of them are connected in some way.Talking about the story, I must admit I do not like the other half - after Anna and Vronsky get together. The reason why is that Anna gets completely insane with jealousy. She gets so possessive and wants Vronsky only for himself. There is a lot of that left out from the movie but it still got on my nerves. But that is the main theme - how a respectable woman by following her dreams becomes weak and very much dependent.The ending was a bit surprising for me, because it just shows short glimpses of everybody's life without showing the effect of her suicide. It seems that only her brother is affected - everybody else looks happy and goes on with their lives.",Anna Karenina

The story, ofcourse, is not easy to digest for modern women. We feel sortie for the way women were kept like birds in golden cages. And some still experience this. So women might have difficulty to watch it. Still it is the way it was. The actors are great theaterplayers in the way they use their texts, and great movieactors in the way they move and use tiny expressions.

Go see ""The Sessions"" or ""Lincoln.""From the opening sequence to the final shot, this film moves so slowly that one could enter the theater too young for Social Security and reach maturity during the presentation.There is no one in this film to care about. I judge the quality of most films by the depth at which I care about the characters and how many characters actually get me to care about them. The film is a gimmick or maybe a series of gimmicks. Visual stunts that might work well in a typical Hollywood film but do not work in trying to portray a classic period piece. There are moment of visual elegance and some lovely scenes, edits and transitions. But largely, this piece does not hold together and it runs far too long.",Anna Karenina

The costumes and set designs were breathtaking. I have not read Tolstoy's novel, nor have I seen any of the prior versions. However, I love period piece movies, like The Other Boleyn girl, and novel adaptations. I particularly liked the way the sets were like a theater stage, changing from one scene to the next in a neatly flowing manner. The character development was done well, even though I heard after watching that some story lines from the novel were removed, probably to keep the movie within two hours. But it was done well enough for me to see the pain and anguish develop as Anna spirals more and more towards insanity. I believe the ending was the most obvious.

And I agree with all the people who question whether the performance metaphor for the artificiality of Russian society is effective, considering it's dragged out so long instead of just used as a framing device (as it is in both Olivier's and Branagh's versions of Henry V). Maybe it would have worked had it been filmed as a live performance. As for the performances, it may be deliberate that the lovers seem hollow while Law's Karenin, the most repressed character in the story, somehow implies worlds of conflicting emotions and pain underneath his reserve, but it sells Anna short. Bi-polar she may be (one reason Vivien Leigh's portrayal was so effective), but shallow she is not. Knightley is good in later scenes where Anna's personality starts to disintegrate, but the attraction to and obsession with Vronsky were simply inexplicable. The reviewer who suggested that this approach might have worked better with Mme. Bovary nailed it, I think.",Anna Karenina

It's certainly not a movie - not this one!,3,23 September 2012,"My instant response to this film was to reflect that it was as well that Ken Russell didn't live to see it, because it might have killed him. Indeed, I now feel marginally better about the horrid excesses of Russell's career after seeing this half-baked, insufferably pretentious, imitation-clever, essentially lifeless, gee-kids-let's-do-the-show-here version of Tolstoy's masterpiece. Joe Wright, having tried and failed to emulate both David Lean and Joseph Losey in ""Atonement"", now imitates, not just Russell, but Michael Powell, Max Ophuls, Josef Von Sternberg, Stanley Kubrick and even the Cukor film of ""My Fair Lady"" in order to impose a ""stylized"" version of the story upon Tom Stoppard's efficient screenplay. Stylized, my eye. A realistic, conventional approach would have been far more suitable. Ah, but then we might not have noticed the director. As it is, we notice him all the time, but we're hardly ever moved, as we should always be. To be fair to Wright, he manages a few brief moments of skill - Vronsky's pausing to spit out a mouthful of cheroot-smoke before kissing a lady's hand is a good, character-defining moment, and Karenin's heartbroken immobility as he overhears his son's declaration of love for Anna (a declaration who noticeably excludes him) is genuinely eloquent. Indeed, the actors are mostly quite effective, and, if placed in a realistic, believable and (above all) consistent context, the film might have been at least satisfactory. As it is, it's a mess.",Anna Karenina

The stilted transition, the artsy fartsy staging, the awkward mis en scene of this movie made it a farce of a masterpiece that was done so beautifully with Vivien Leigh and Fredreich March before. The director's eagerness to show off his uniquely creative genius drained every ounce of the movie's possible connection with the audience. When the focus is on the making of the movie instead of the story of the movie, it made any emotional involvement with the characters impossible.

Don't get me wrong; I love a good stylized period piece. I loved Stoker. However, the implementation of ""stylizing"" the film in the form of a stage setting does not add to the film's richness. Rather, it takes away from the seriousness of the subject matter and is inappropriate. I was on the edge of my seat only because the fear was so great that they'd at some point break out into song and dance. If you want to see a serious adaptation of this novel done properly, watch Anna Karenina 1997 with Sophie Marceau. It is far superior. If you're reading this and want to know which version you should watch, do pick the older version. Sophie Marceau is phenomenal as Anna Karenina. Kiera Knightly? Not so much. She doesn't capture the heartbreak as well as Sophie does, in my opinion. It saddens me to think that people will see this version and not that one.",Anna Karenina
129,Cjalln1,"Anna Karenina - a bold, original, epic spectacle",10,8 June 2015,"Simply put, Joe Wright's adaption of ""Anna Karenina"" is the best period drama I've ever seen. It displays unique, original directing, from the enjoyable theatre-style perspective to the simple yet emotive denouement. Its story is understandably intricate and intelligent (Tolstoy) and every single actor/actress contributes to a highly believable tale, even for most viewers who won't be acquainted with 19th century Russia. The film's unique attraction is its superb set design: each scene is crafted as if on a theatre stage, complete with freeze-frame tableaux, moving scenery partitions and a fourth-wall-breaking above-stage vantage point. The cinematography similarly contributes to the immersive experience using swooping cameras and intricate angles and editing. This original perspective elevates ""Anna Karenina"" above other tedious costume dramas.Keira Knightley portrays the eponymous character's development subtly yet effectively, alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson's rather emotionless interpretation of Count Vronsky. A beautiful orchestral score (resplendent with authentic Russian folk song instrumentals) grounds the film in its historic setting whilst creating a powerful atmosphere. There is the use of powerful symbolism and foreshadowing throughout - though I can't elaborate without giving too much away! Costumes and set design are understandably impressive given the film's genre. The only questionable element is the facial hair sported by almost every male cast member (probably thanks to the aristocratic Russian setting).At times, the plot thickens to the point of requiring more than casual attention - in part due to each character's colourful name - but a complex plot is (in my opinion) something to be treasured not vilified. There is a tendency to despair at characters' selfish and thoughtless actions, although that is the nature of Tolstoy's tale. All in all, ""Anna Karenina"" is remarkable thanks to high-calibre acting, a surprisingly effective theatrical premise, and the combination of set design, cinematography and production which craft an unforgettable atmosphere and story.",Anna Karenina

131,rbrogan-61779,The stage-play motif is brought off magnificently with vital creative spirit.,9,27 September 2015,"Anna Karenina is a great story, and this is an adaptation that gets better each time you see it. At first, it can be a bit confusing, because it is like a musical piece that one has to hear more than once to get the feel of; but a good amount of feeling does go into the film. Kiera Knightly plays a very sympathetic Anna: natural, and not exactly naive, but at the same time does not really know what she is doing as she is pulled about by her ""demon"". The film looks great and the stage-play motif is brought off magnificently with vital creative spirit. The main downside of the film is that Count Vronsky does not come off as someone worth ruining oneself over (though perhaps others will think different). On the other hand, the scenes between Anna and her husband (played by Jude Law) have very good dramatic tension and draw the film through each act. All-in-all, Anna Karenina is a good film with rewatch value. This is a commercial production, but a very creative and interesting one.

It tells the story of a woman, who cannot contain her love (more likely passion), could not digest it and driven to her destruction. This film is like a stately building which has been removed from its landscape. Background story of Russian Aristocracy, political situation, forms a backdrop of Anna's story. To make it simple, most of the background has been minimised. Although the building is grand, it is difficult to fully appreciate without its landscape. So film is good but it is one-sided. In that sense Tom Stoppard has done a good job in a limited way. Both Keira Knightly and Jude Law entertain with their very good performance. A woman is able to digest or unable to digest her passion depends on her character, background and also time and space she lives. That's why I believe this film is incomplete.",Anna Karenina

Not unlike what happens in an opera based on a preexisting work, (let's say Otello by Verdi,) details are not always respected to preserve the thrust of the emotional drama in a much shorter new art form, in this case, a film. Of course many of the reviewers here with a negative opinion will point to better book adaptations of Anna Karenina in film. But they miss the point. This is not an adaptation. It is a new artistic work based on another. This film nests Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, but it has its own expressive tools and its own take on the story. The use of dancing and of the rundown theater as metaphors for relationships judged by crumbling society was extraordinary. Besides this, the acting of Jude Law as Karenin will be remembered for years to come and is worth viewing no matter what opinion the rest of the film may deserve.

In general, I'm well aware of the fact that novels and movies are different animals and I don't like crude comparisons of movies with the novels they are based upon.Nevertheless, IMHO, this particular movie fails in conveying anything of the spiritual content of the novel.

As always, Keira Knightley shined; her performance as Anna Karenina stunned me, and it left me emotional. She seems to shine the brightest in historical settings; she was the perfect Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice, and in Pirates of the Caribbean, she made Elizabeth Swan just as memorable.Overall, I love Anna Karenina; it surprised me, and it inspired me to read the book, which is, like, 800 or so pages long; I enjoyed that, too.

136,bruce-moreorless,Theatric and stylish adaptation of classic tale,8,6 March 2013,"Director Joe Wright and actress Keira Knightley once again team up in this theatric and stylish adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina. As with their previous outings (adaptations of Ian McEwan's 'Atonement' and Jane Austin's 'Pride and Prejudice') the film remains broadly faithful to the source material but is not afraid to tweak, compress and outright rewrite to attain dramatic effect. Such free interpretation may not appeal to purists but it does result in a rich and exciting experience for the film-goer.The screenplay is by legendary playwrite Tom Stoppard and, as you would expect from such an experienced hand, contains all the main themes from Tolstoy's classic tale. I was particularly impressed by the deft handling of the relationship between Levin and Kitty. The drawing room scene where these two young lovers are reconciled was especially touching.The film does, however, and by necessity, leave a lot of the source material out, making it that much harder to understand Anna's despair. The passion that Anna and Vronsky have for each other is convincingly established but Anna's demons are not sufficiently drawn. The final quarter of the film feels rather rushed, though at over two hours the complete package is a bit over-long. Joe Wright's biggest gamble with this film was the use of highly stylised sets and a theatre-hall conceit. The film is hyper-realistic and reminiscent of a Baz Luhrmann production. It drips with colour, opulence and movement. Again, this may not appeal to the purists.

And that's all.The rest is wrecked: - count Vronsky, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, is one of the weakest parts of the movie - a good actor with a wrongly chosen role; - the costumes had nothing to do with that time's dressing - they were so vanguard that could bring shame on nowadays most vanguard fashion designers; - nothing from the spirit of the Leo Tolstoy's novel - no Russian habits, no Russian nature, no Russian outlook of the actors (may be some make up would have helped), no Russia.

Keira K looks ravishing as usual (but I always think if she'd gain 20 pounds she'd be the most stunning actress alive) but the costumes and scenery cannot save this mess. The actor playing Vronsky here is utterly abysmal. Nothing of Anna's doomed demented passion is on display here and Vronsky looks like a schoolboy fresh off the soccer pitch waiting to be picked up by his Mummy. Shame that Tolstoy's masterpiece has such an uneven cinematic record of adaptations-Masterpiece Theater back in the 70s gave it a pretty decent treatment and Sean Bean was a rough-hewn but hot Vronsky back in the day as well.

All these are aspects of the original story written by Tolstoy, but this movie isn't about Tolstoy and his concepts of character and plot. It is about the film makers and how cleaver they are.I went into the theater with a basic understanding of the plot of Anna Karenina, though I have to admit I never read the book. as I watched the opening scene, which portrays the actions as if they were on a stage with a live audience, I thought, ""well's that a cleaver prologue, can't wait for the actual story to begin."" But then to my horror, they continued this practice throughout the entire movie, causing much confusion on what the hell was actually going on.It got so bad, my reflexes got the better of me and i did what I never do at a movie; I fell fast asleep!When i awoke, the film was a little more comprehensible, but still felt like I was watching the remake of ""The Caine Mutiny"", where the creators patted themselves on the back for being geniuses, and staging the court room scenes on a basketball court.

My wife, who normally loves period pieces with their colors and costume design, commented in the middle of the movie that ""she hoped Anna would hurry up and jump in front of the train so we could get out of the theater.""

By hanging a theatrical frame on this very melodramatic story he is able to both highlight the inherent soap opera (hang a lantern on it, so to speak) while at the same time giving us much needed emotional distance; we can enjoy the truth of the situations and simultaneously understand their inherent theatricality and this magically frees us to find a deeper connection. By the use of abstraction he is able to move effortlessly from scene to scene- thereby allowing for a brisk yet resonant form of storytelling. The actors are absolutely committed and deliver across the board stunning performances, especially Jude Law, Domhnall Gleeson and a truly transcendent Alicia Vikander. I just finished reading the novel last week and I can say definitively that Joe Wright has mastered not only the tone and voice and emotions of Tolstoy's book but found a way to seamlessly convey the expansiveness of the world as well as the finely wrought intimate details of the smallest exchanges. Bravo to everyone involved, from the costumes, production design, choreography, musical soundtrack and especially Tom Stoppard's absolutely breathtaking screenplay. A real honest to God masterpiece.",Anna Karenina
143,the_grand_lebowski,"""Did No Mean Never?""",7,2 December 2012,"Leo Tolstoy's most prolific tragedy, Anna Karenina, is currently one of the most adapted novels of all time. There is little surprise in that fact, seeing as Karenina is one of the highest regarded books of our time, and few people can resist a love story. While Tolstoy's novel had plenty to say about Russian society, capitalism, and religion, most film adaptations have focused chiefly on the love aspect of Anna Karenina. Joe Wright, who is responsible for this latest adaptation of Tolstoy's work, does not deviate much from the common formula of Karenina adaptations. He does, however, mark it with a specific style, which makes this version impressively unique.The majority of the story takes place in a theater, literally. Characters can be seen not only stepping out onto the main stage for a specific scene, but may also climb the stairs backstage to arrive at another location. Though this feature is never clarified in the film, it does not detract from the substance of the story. Although such a decision could easily have decayed into a garbled mess, Wright securely controls the film's tempo so that each scene dissolves into the next seamlessly. One advertisement for Anna Karenina claimed the doomed affair was the ""greatest love story of all time."" I have personally never heard the novel spoken of in such a way, and would be surprised if anyone could draw that conclusion after seeing Wright's film. Love abounds in Karenina, but it is not generated from the source one would expect. Keira Knightley and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who play the secret lovers Anna and Count Vronsky, exhibit almost zero charisma as a couple. They are constantly declaring their love at each other, but never truly showing the proper emotions. Johnson particularly is as ridiculous as his odd hairstyle. He has a complete lack of charisma. I find most of Knightley's films dull, but have always enjoyed her in Wright's films; they seem to have a fantastic partnership. However, she seems miscast as our title character. She does not exude the quiet strength which humanized Anna in the novel, but rather comes across as a spoiled brat determined to claim her prize. When the lovers finally commit their adulterous act, it is filmed in such an absurd fashion that one feels equally uncomfortable and amused. Fortunately, where Knightley and Johnson stumble, Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander ascend. Gleeson and Vikander portray Kostya Levin and Kitty, respectively. Levin collects the entirety of the audience's sympathy when he is disregarded by Kitty, and maintains a tender grip on our emotions as he puzzles over his failure. The couple is the highlight of this picture. If love is to be even remotely ascertained from this story, Levin and Kitty are the real embodiment of it. This is an aspect of the novel that Wright brilliantly captures. Another Wright alum returning to an endearing role in this film is Matthew Macfadyen, playing Stiva Oblonsky. Macfadyen is the comedic energy in this picture. His role is as grandiose as his comical mustache. Macfadyen is popular for his conservative roles, but proves to have a true knack for comedy as Stiva. Jude Law and Kelly Macdonald are two more actors to note. Law as the cuckolded Karenin is a role that demands an ability to display genuine emotional ache, and Law delivers. Macdonald is wonderful as the disparaged Dolly, who struggles to forgive her husband's infidelities. Macdonald's role is minute, but she hammers a fierce personality into her brief time on screen. Anna Karenina is an enjoyable film, though it lacks a few characteristics to make it grand. The theater concept has many people scratching their heads, and condemning the film as pretentious, but Wright and Tom Stoppard, who wrote the screenplay, have managed to place an interesting mark on a popular story. I am not one for congratulating something based solely on attempt, but Anna Karenina does enough right that I would be remiss to dismiss it entirely.",Anna Karenina
144,lintonskanshed,Joe Wright does a classic in theater,6,5 May 2013,"Joe Wright chose to film version of Tolstoy's gigantic work Anna Karenina with Keira Knightley in the lead role.The information contained in the book about 900 pages can not squeeze in a little over two hours long feature film. Wright's solution to it all is an unrealistic film. Where we are at an early stage will see how he selected the movie to play out like in a theater. The whole film is a constructed scenery-world as opposed to a more conventional film version. The extras draws attention to itself by appearing strikingly coordinated instead to blend. This is not a heavy film, it is built on a light almost playful manner, and the two hours inside the theater flows easily past my retinas. Scene changes are resourceful, with this grip has distanced Wright captured the high society as in a theater. The illusion the theater portrays exemplifies aristocracy dark facades and false game. The whole movie is like a kind of hybrid between reality and theater, as actors can suddenly go from a stage into the wild for real outdoor scenes. The result is engaging and provocative.Keira Knightley makes a somewhat same piece Anna Karenina but carries the role with dignity. Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the role of Vronskij I have difficulty with and he feels more like a blonde doll than the passionate man he really should portray. The film's short running time meant that I was almost sure that the film almost exclusively would highlight, was the interaction between Anna and Vronskij. The book describes the interaction between Levin and Kitty lovingly and with depth. This is portrayed in an acceptable way the film's length notwithstanding. Obviously, had the couple's life in the countryside and Levin's love and closeness to agriculture have been plausible to develop something. Then I know that Levin in the book, was an own interpretation of Tolstoy himself, I am somewhat surprised and even disappointed when Domhnall Gleeson shows up with long orange hair in the role of Levin. Alicia Vikander do have an impressive interpretation of Levin's wife Kitty and spreads heat seemingly effortlessly. She and Jude Law in the role of Karenin is in my opinion the show's primary retention.Hunting scenes with Levin and Oblonskij, was in the book, my favorite chapter. The descriptions made me experience both nature and the surroundings with all my senses. When this scene appears in the movie is the feeling of presence I found in the book that has been washed away. The film has only this one scene that is also cold and unemotional, and according to me, the movie would have coped better without it. After Anna's death Vronskij, in the book, chose to enlist as a soldier. He went to Serbia to fight in the Russo-Turkish War. This important event I personally think is missing in the film. The incident shows how he is affected by Anna's death and how he as a soldier also was ready to die.In the 1800s, when the book was written, women were seen with today's eyes, it is hard in the community in many arenas. In that Tolstoy wrote that although women have extramarital love affairs could possibly be see Tolstoy as an innovative feminist. This can be seen as contradictory by how he in the book with a somewhat slow painful tone portrayed women, their duties and services. In a comparison between Tolstoy's descriptions of women and animals such as dogs and horses, it would be visible to the animal descriptions are much more detailed and loving.With eyes on the religious perspective, it becomes visible that the film is the prominent religious arguments, as the characters engage in, dimmed. The book describes Levin's difficulties in the search for their faith very prominent, but in the movie, however, there is not even included. The only visible issue in both the book and the movie is how Karenin contend with including guilt about adultery. Many of the male characters are very involved in politics and social issues in the film, we see no hint of this.The suit in the film, which is created by Jacqueline Durran is grand and sensational fabulous and generated an Oscar.A thought that is might be interesting is that what if Wright had made an interpretation and let Anna live happily ever after, instead of letting her fall in front of the train. According to one tale, it is said that when the first French translation translator became so enamored of Anna Karenina, that he just could not let her fall in front of the train but thus allowed her to survive.",Anna Karenina
145,jpclifford,What is it up?,2,30 October 2016,"Someone made me view this picture on DVD. But the enclosure told that the screenplay was of Tom Stoppard. I acutely froze. I had seen his picture ""Parades End"". In this picture he lets a man who lives in a nearby hell choose for his ""redemption"" a fearless suffragette. My youth learned me that people who know no anguish or fear are a terror to themselves and the society thy live in. So, I watched the movie and the only emotion that came to me was disgust, very strong. I am afraid that Tom Stoppard ranks with Oliver Stone and (yes!) even with Harold Pinter. The DVD opens with a preview of ""Les Miserables"". It closes with the sentence ""Live has destroyed my dream"". That reminded me of another picture in which a man with a great bottle of whiskey in his hand says: ""Live does this to us"". I am afraid that live does not do this and people who give this utterance are moved by only one drive: blood thirst.Enjoy.",Anna Karenina

Clever use of tableaux, surrealist elements and breathtaking visual images bring out the character's emotions so strongly that halfway through the film I felt like I wasn't a mere spectator anymore. I WAS Anna, so completely and utterly was I engrossed in her world.Knightley performs well. For years I was convinced she could only play one single type of role - the pretty girl who stands around and bats her eyelashes - but ""A Dangerous Method"" and now ""Anna Karenina"" have changed my mind. Knightley's matured as an actress, and now manages to give a depth to her characters that makes them utterly believable.Though many have criticized him, I think Aaron Taylor-Johnson works as Vronsky. He's charming and seductive and it's easy to see why Anna cannot resist him.And as for Jude Law, his portrayal of passionless, prudish, but oh, so decent Karenin was nothing less than Oscar worthy.Wright's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is mediocre, his ""Atonement"" is good. His ""Anna Karenina"", however, is sensual and stunning and I can only recommend it.",Anna Karenina

149,Lawlass,"Beautiful work of art, but lacking in character development",7,25 December 2012,"This movie has some beautiful aspects to it, such that I believe it aptly deserves the title of a work of art. It is a different movie-experience in that Joe Wright filmed parts of it as a stage play. Combined with the dramatic romantic and tragic flair of the plot, and the aesthetic beauty of the costumes and backdrop, this movie is visually entertaining. I did not find the transitions between stage-play scenes to be distracting; instead, I found them to create a unique, bold, and captivating experience. I particularly found the steeplechase scene and the Moscow-theater scene to be compelling, stunning, and magical.Much has been written about the miscasting of the actors. I had just finished reading the novel prior to seeing the movie, and I was greatly disappointed in the choice of Keira Knightley as Anna. Tolstoy's Anna is full-bodied, voluptuous, round, and mature; Keira Knightley, while a stunning beauty, needs to drink a few beers and eat some stew to put on some weight, and she is too young to have played the role of an older woman. There should have been a greater age discrepancy between Anna and Vronsky; instead, with the casting of Knightley and Taylor-Johnson, they seemed like two young, giddy, contemporaries. Tolstoy often describes Vronsky as being in awe of the aristocratic Anna and he repeatedly describes Vronsky as ""obedient"" to Anna. This movie never captures the true essence of the lovers' relationship, due to the miscasting of the lead roles. Unfortunately, as a tragic love story, the movie fails.Finally, even with the miscasting, Wright should have brought us more scenes of the relationship between Anna and Vronsky, so as to develop the characters such that you cared about them. When reading Tolstoy's novel, I cried at points; but I did not feel moved by Wright's portrayal of the novel.",Anna Karenina

The story lines never seemed to get lost in each other and was very well told. Those that left early should have stayed. They would have got their moneys worth. I've seen previous versions and this was the first one that kept me watching and not wanting to get up. The actors were all good. I don't think a bad one in the lot.

And I am one of those guys who stays to the bitter end of every movie. I see it as almost a badge of honor. But there are 4 movies I have failed in the last two years, and this is one of them.I guess it was the stage motif. (spoiler) In case you are not aware, there is a device in the movie whereby some scenes take place on a theater stage. When a person leaves a room, for example, they might open a door in the ballroom which opens onto a stage and then they exit a door at the back of the stage that opens into the next scene. It is done very matter-of-factly and the actors proceed to and across the stage in the same manner they would if they had to walk across the lawn. It is bizarre. And it did not work for me. And after about the third entrance or exit to or from the theater I had enough.I can't intelligently comment on any other aspect of the film, other than to add that in the relatively short time I watched it, it never captured my attention.",Anna Karenina

153,Golligow,A 10/10 Masterpiece,10,28 January 2013,"You just can't make films better than this. It compares a little with Moulin Rouge which too was a masterpiece, a 9 out of 10 masterpiece, and last year's Hugo, a 1/10 rotten egg - it has all of Hugo's style plus spadefuls more, but none of Hugo's manifold failings: essentially a plot and characters you'd have to be a dormouse to engage with. The plot and characters here are right out of the top drawer, it's Anna Karenina by TOLSTOY! The source material is the real deal, and Tom Stoppard is a past master at getting the best out of these old stories. So, all good, then you watch the first ten minutes and it is very annoying, just (it felt) too stylized and self conscious (as a lot of pseuds here have levelled). But I gradually got it, bought into the style, and then it was just unrelenting in its beauty, it frankly has to be the most beautiful film I've ever laid my eyes on, think Doctor Zhivago crossed with Age of Innocence (both great films)and you're half way there to getting in the clothes of this film. I can't believe Joe Wright isn't in there for best director at the Baftas and the film isn't up for best film - I've seen all this year's contenders, Django Unchained (9/10) Lincoln (8/10) Zero Dark Thirty (7/10) Silver Linings Playbook (6.5/10) Life of Pi (8/10) etc etc, but this is the only one that get's the big 10, it is in a different league creatively to those others, yes, even Lincoln with its Stellar cast and director (wasn't it just a bit dull, really?) But not this, this is not dull, it sparkles beautifully, is unforgettable. I wanted to have a little gripe about the casting of Keira Knightly, but I've changed my mind, I can forgive even that.",Anna Karenina
154,costaspap,"The claustrophobic world of ""Anna Karenina""",7,9 January 2013,"The transfer of a classic novel to the big screen is no easy task. In addition to merely representing facts, the director must guide the actors to express the inner dimensions of the drama. More so when this is the work of a great anatomist of the human soul and character! Leo Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"" experienced several film and television adaptations (notable being those of 1935 and 1948). Recently, another cinematic attempt to approach the classic masterpiece made its appearance in theaters (""Anna Karenina"", UK 2012), directed by Joe Wright (""Atonement"", ""Pride & Prejudice""). Let us recall the story: Anna Karenina is a Russian aristocrat of the late 19th century, married to Alexei Karenin, a mild-tempered government official considered a ""saint"" in Russia. Despite her affluent and honorable life, Anna is willing to sacrifice her status in society –and even her own son- for a passionate affair with a young cavalry officer, causing a scandal in the conservative Russian aristocracy... The film inevitably evokes comparison with Laurence Olivier's classic, ""Henry V"" (1944). Both movies begin as filmed performances of a theatrical play. The basic difference is that Olivier's film masterfully escapes in the real world, eventually acquiring a purely cinematic form, which Wright's claustrophobic approach stubbornly refuses to do (with the exception of a few scenes), exhausting its material (not always in the most elegant way) within the space of an almost metaphysical theater. The film suffers from a rather loose editing that makes it seem somewhat longer than it should be. The sets and costumes, though, are impressive, as is the wonderful music scoring by Dario Marianelli. With regard to casting, the choice of Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky was an unfortunate one. As another reviewer aptly remarked, he might have been a proper choice in a story where the heroine seduces a schoolboy, but he certainly isn't quite convincing as a fatal lover who could make an aristocrat's wife become infatuated to the point of absolute self- destruction! Keira Knightley also misses the target. Instead of the refined, mature, morally conscious and deeply human and down-to-earth lady of high society, she delivers a shallow, self-important and emotionally immature young woman who can hardly win sympathies as a heroine of a tragedy. In my opinion, Tilda Swinton would probably have been a better choice! On the contrary, Jude Law gives an excellent performance as an apparently colorless, though deeply tragic, Alexei Karenin. In conclusion, one should certainly not expect to witness a deep penetration into the intellectually and emotionally complex world of Tolstoy. If, on the other hand, one is simply looking for a two-hour, good-quality entertainment, then this is definitely a film one wouldn't want to miss!",Anna Karenina
155,Dunroman,Brilliant or awful?,5,13 September 2012,"Wow. Visually stimulating but utterly frustrating.I went into this open minded and loved the cinematography indeed, unlike some I liked the theatrical setting which served to highlight the façade and falsity of aristocratic mores of the time.However it was too difficult to piece it all together, to understand who was who, what they were doing and why but worse of all - to care.Conclusions - it needs a second or third viewing to understand the depths that are undoubtedly there, but will I? Perhaps but only with my finger hovering over the fast forward button. About a quarter way through I had to be nudged to stop me snoring, by half way through I really was losing the will to live and by the three quarters mark actively on the edge of my seat egging Anna/Keira to drink more morphine.Highlights - Matthew Macfadyn who surely had the best part, the only character one cared about, one that just by the twinkle in his eye made the audience laugh.Highlights - Kiera Knightley who thank goodness didn't say ""come back to me"" - but by contrast there were too many times she seemed to be repeating gestures or movements from P&P or Atonement and too many times Wright repeated devices - such as the mirror scene from Atonement.Lowlights - Vronsky it has been written that Robert Pattinson had been thought of for this part. He would have been infinitely preferable as after a bit of blond attraction one wondered what a gloriously beautiful Anna/Keira could see in such a shallow characterless fop - not nice, not nasty, not villain, not charmer, not much at all. Very poor casting.Finally I really am confused by this film. It's surely not a masterpiece, though technically excellent in many ways, one wonders if Wright was trying too hard or worse still trying to emulate some long dead European art house film. I leave the verdict to the audience, that just like in the third part of Lord of the Rings, duty done, breathed a collective sigh of relief when the titles rolled and rushed for the doors.",Anna Karenina

This is NOT a usual romantic movie. The style of the film is very different and takes some time to get used to. If you are looking for a regular movie, you may not like this film.

158,marciserentant,The Ultimate Movie Version,10,21 April 2020,"This looks like the Ultimate Movie Version! It's not the story that prevails, but it does prime the soul of the book. Magistral ! You have to go through the superficial first vision where the romantic narrative dominates about a love triangle. It is only in the deepest layer that you find the core of the book - beyond her romantic thinking at the end of the nineteenth century about the countryside and nature of which man is alienated. As is often the case with a layered work, the key lies with some prior knowledge, although the visual language does provide sufficient material for this purpose.
The film is constructed as a cross between Theater, Opera and various Film styles in which both the period of silent film and the use of contemporary digital means are optimally applied. This is similar to "" The Mill and the Cross "". The theatrical process also makes it palatable for Russians to speak English; they are archetypal figures, apart from an existing context. In the end, rather than the character of the characters, the deepest core of the book is highlighted : Tolstoy's belief that true life takes place on the flat land. On the other hand, city life is vain glare that can only lead to destruction and destruction. The city images are theatrically constructed , even the train scenes and the horse races continue on stage , but the country life is filmed in outdoor locations ; lands where living and working is carried out , difficult but lifelike , and also the hunting scene takes place in a real forest , the people there are viable. On the other hand, the urban environment remains décor ; dazzlingly beautiful , but with death as the end point, puppets without will, sublimely imagined at the end of the film while grass overgrows the theatre with a lookout over the land. Reality and fiction merge. No answer is given to existential questions , which remain open to either option: Urban or Rural. The final decision lies with the viewer (reader).

159,aliceflupper,Unwatchable,1,12 August 2017,"'Anna Karenina' (2012) makes sure no one goes back to Leo Tolstoy's classic. The novel, 'Anna Karenina' is an extensive study of love, betrayal, pride and prejudice, to name a few. It's largely made up of interior monologues and smoothly switches between points of view of multiple characters. It touches on the ego and explores timeless dilemmas that stay as relatable today as they once were. Unfortunately, while the book preserves the Russian flair for the romantic without seeming fake, Joe Wright's film does the exact opposite. The flair for the fake burns out any traces of romanticism. Firstly, the film simply does not do justice to the themes it works with. With enough material in the book, the director chose to omit crucial chapters which serve to clarify the characters' decisions and build tension for important narrative twists. Without them, it seems as if Karenina, Vronsky, and Levin were mentally ill as they base their most important life-choices on whims. The screenplay focuses on telling the story of a woman torn between two men. I think I might have seen that before... Without knowing Anna's motives and her nuanced fight with herself and society, the film gets reduced to a love story between a moody, rich diva and a narcissistic soldier - hardly the premise for an epic. The setting hinders that simplistic meaning too. Wright applies a theatrical, over-the-top convention, which drowns the meaning, for the sake of cheap dances and background gimmicks. With everyone dancing, entering different settings, which are being constructed as we watch, the classic turns into a cheap play which relies on distractions to keep the audience's attention. With that, the film seems to be apologizing for its own existence. The over-saturation permeates the acting as well. Every gesture, every sigh, every word of Anna's is exaggerated and ends up insincere. Same goes for Kitty and Dolly. The décor oozes with gold and silver. The costumes, beautiful as they are, look like carefully selected props and not clothes that people lived in. Always creaseless, and starched to the point of standing up on their own, the gowns occupy more space than the actors. The fabrics rustle competing with the soundtrack. All in all, a cringe-worthy spectacle you pray to be over.",Anna Karenina

It is sad when a man from Serbia (where trains are often late more than one hour) has to say that this train was the one he's been waiting for the longest time. Somewhere at half of the movie I was trying to summon the train, and the director kept poking the audience with it, something Leo didn't bother his readers with, more than once. Interesting scene changes were pretty symbolic and lifelike, so I didn't have problem with them. Maybe the biggest negative point could be given to the cast, actually the choice. I don't think Keira and Aaron are bad actors, but they were seriously lost in this movie, not for the parts. Well, Aaron isn't even old enough to play Vronsky. I didn't like Domhnall Gleeson as Levin, neither. Jude Law did a pretty good job. Matthew Macfadyen, Alicia Vikander did great jobs also, but, their characters, Oblonsky and Kitty, were extremely neglected and forgotten by the director and/or the screenwriter. They were somehow too busy dealing with the love story, which was not the main accent of the book. The main accent is the family and society, just check the first sentence. We didn't see at least f or s of those two words. This is romantic tragicomedy and parody, only for people who didn't read the book.

It's as if he were doing Shakespearean sonnets and correcting the rhyme and meter.And casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky? When he first came out I thought they'd done a spoof. He reminded me of Gene Wilder in a Mel Brooks version of Tolstoy. On the other hand, Jude Law was perfect as Karenin, as were Domnhall Gleeson as Levin and Olivia Williams as Countess Vronskaya. Sadly, Keira Knightly seems to have thought she was still doing Pirates of the Caribbean, as far from Tolstoy as you can be.How two marvelously creative men, Wright who did Atonement and Stoppard who gave us the incredible Coast of Utopia, could do this is beyond comprehension.",Anna Karenina

It leaves you to realize that Anna is actually selfish and though given many chances by her loving husband still decides to leave her son to follow her lover and in the end he is just as selfish as she is because he takes up another mistress while he is with Anna.The acting in this film is overall wonderful the only actor I would say should 100% percent get a nom would have to be Jude Law he displays the wonderful husband who loves his wife despite what she has done, but is also concerned about his image in society. In the end I think he does forgive her but somehow is still haunted, like anyone would be, about her death and always thinking what he could have to to help her.This movie is amazing I don't normally get very emotional at the movies but this one left me teary.

Joe Wright, mostly known for Directing TV series such as ""Bob and Rose"" and films such as ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Atonement"" and ""The Soloist,"" has managed, not just to recreate 19th century Russia on the celluloid but also where atmosphere is concerned and above all, he manages to keep the audience glued. Writer, Tom Stoppard, known for writing scripts for movies such as, ""Shakespeare in Love,"" ""Brazil,"" ""The Russia House"" and ""Empire of the Sun."" has written the script of this which depicts the story as a stage drama – scenes being shown as if they were on a stage and this may be a downfall in this and somehow, with this, he manages to keep the audience glued to screen and seats. Dario Marianelli's music score is a strength to this screen version of Leo Tolstoy's classic novel.Some, and in particular, those who are not familiar with Tolstoy's stories, may find it difficult to know what is happening as like most of his novels, concentration is a must and others may get irritated by the way the story is told – stage drama. This is a movie that may make you wish that you had brought a packet of tissues as there is a lot of emotions involved.A worth while watching movie if you like reading Leo Tolstoy.",Anna Karenina
173,nyf85,Much to be said about nothing,6,26 March 2013,"I was not overly impressed with Keira as Karenina. I only saw a childish display of love but in a very adult situation where there is too much at stake. I may have liked the book more. I found myself wishing for more of a story. I wonder if there was more to Karenina I was not getting from the movie. I grew bored of watching the selfish child-like antics. How many times will there be a bored woman looking for a deeper love and deciding to leave her family to pursue the forbidden. I felt like something was missing, like a twist. I couldn't even connect to the actors ""passion."" There was an overall likeness I had for the film so I decided to give it an okay rating. There were some interesting filming concepts that deserve a little praise. I also enjoyed Kitty's outcome. The idea of the stage was unique but made for confusion and at times annoyance. I guess all the world's a stage, right.",Anna Karenina
174,shelby-lbarr,"Great Movie, Don't Focus on The Bad reviews",8,17 February 2013,"This movie was great. From reading the other reviews it was a love it or hate it film. The set-up of the film was completely unique, as majority of it is set on a stage, but it does not overpower the film or plot, it is something you adjust too after the first twenty minutes or so. I have not ever encountered a movie like it. The acting was superb, and the story-line was so realistically and heartbreakingly honest. I didn't want to movie to end as I was so tied to the characters. It leaves you with a hefty conversation of discussion and I would completely recommend it to others and will be watching it again. It may not be for anyone but definitely give it a try!",Anna Karenina
175,pinardumlupinar11,this is a #mustsee screenplay !,8,3 March 2018,"Such an extraordinary screenplay! thanks to #tomstoppard one can experience a totally different version of Anna Karenina, a unique version.. yes, the screenplay is not the exact copy of the novel, but it creates its own version not sticking to the original one. however in some parts it might have been better to keep it a little traditional, maybe just to keep that tense darkness of the novel.and #joewright did an excellent job in this movie. that stream which makes you feel like watching a different kind of a musical.. it is really mesmerising !#keiraknightley is absolutely fascinating! the most identifying thing about Anna Karenina is those historical moments and #keiraknightley is really perfect in those scenes..#judelaw is also very good.. however I wish someone else played Vronsky, not because Aaron Taylor johnson is not good at acting, but he is not what novel makes one picture Kont Vronsky in his/her (at least my) mind.And I think #seamusmcgarvey should have won the award for the best achievement in cinematography.. at most of the scenes I felt like stopping and getting a screenshot just to keep that beautiful beautiful picture! that's pure art! Marvelous job!!",Anna Karenina
176,rick-f,Jude Law got underpaid to work with amateurs,1,3 March 2018,"The extremely unattractive style and poor acting abilities of Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky made this movie unbearable to watch. The movie seemed interesting at first, but at least twice in the first sixty minutes I had to stop and ask what the hell is going on here. One minute I am watching Keira with a dude who seems like her husband, then she is checking out Aaron who appears married to a woman old enough to be his mother and then next thing you know he is in bed with Keira in what seemed to be a dream fantasy, but it was real. How does she go from being alone to ending up in bed with this dude?
The directing for this film is garbage. This is two hours of my life I want back. Movies like this is why when someone says if your product is bad you should feel bad applies to these low-budget hack directors ripping off movie-goers.The only positive of this film is Jude Law and the camera visuals.",Anna Karenina
177,x_narinka_x,Disappointing,2,24 December 2012,"For over a year I have been waiting for this move to come out. I had just read the book then and couldn't wait to see it on screen with such wonderful actors. I must say that I love this book and cannot describe it in words, but I couldn't read any other book after this, just because nothing compares to this masterpiece. And I am a person who loves reading...But this movie... From the first scene it seems like a mockery of what is definitely one of the best books ever written. The only thing that captures the original idea and feeling of the book is Keira Knightley's acting (and only at some moments). The rest, all of the directors work, is nothing but a caricature of Tolstoy's work. To take such a complex and rich book, which contains so many life lessons and so much intelligence, or rather brilliance, and make it into a simple, frivolous play, is simply profanation.I understand that the director has tried to be creative (and has probably succeeded at that), and I am just an amateur giving my opinion of course, but it is still says something when he had such a masterpiece in his hands, a group of magnificent actors and still has managed to make the movie (for some moments at least) pure torture for me to watch....",Anna Karenina

I didn't get the quick dialogues, the decorchanges and the many, many characters that were thrown at me in the first 10 minutes.I love Keira Knightley, and the acting of other actors wasn't the reason I stopped watching. It was only the weird plot...Maybe if I'd read the book first, the movie would make more sense to me...",Anna Karenina
179,fahhutch,Destroying and Creating...,5,8 February 2013,"Anna Karinina, the great Russian love story by Tolstoy, evinces two things: One, 'that obscure object of desire,' and two, how the Ego destroys! Of course, the Ego also creates, the task is to get control of it. Few movie stars, whose Egos are whetting into throbbing machinations, need to apply! O. Welles, who I once worked with in 'Hollywood,' said; 'Hollywood is for golfers, gardeners, and golden girls.' My 'review' here does not contain enough lines... There must be a minimum of 10. So.... What else can we say about A.K., this motion picture one of many... I wonder how many have been produced...? Greta Garbo would have been good as Anna, whom else? My Bolivian DVD purchased for nothing 5Bs., or .75cents had been pirated of course. Most of these come from members of the Academy, as they have that superimposed line about how these are only 'screening copies,' and should not be sold, etc. The problem here in Bolivia, is the quality.. Most of them don't work in my MacBook.",Anna Karenina
180,sherri_richardson,So much passion For/Against this movie.,7,14 September 2014,"Anna Kerenina isn't a warm and fuzzy story. I can't help but believe much of the negativity is about the character herself and her flaws and not about the movie, but no disrespect intended to those who feel it does not measure up to the novel.What I appreciated about this movie was that the underlying message seems to be that if you live your life the right way the possibility of long term happiness is simply more achievable.Keira Knightley is as usual chosen for the neurotic mess she seems to play so well, or perhaps it is that she is the one dimensional actress many believe she is. I don't think she did a bad job, and other then some considerable over acting this is one of her more respectable roles. Jude Law steps away from his usual steamy hot self and does a really good job being a decent but distant husband, and the general theatrical way in which the movie was filmed was a noble effort and I respected its originality. Anna Karenina works for me because I fully appreciate a snapshot of a time so distant and a world away. The clothes, the style, the usual hypocrites associated with money and status- this is not the best but hardly the worst movie I have seen this year. I found it to be enjoyable but a movie without any twists and turns and everything played out pretty much the way you would expect it to.",Anna Karenina
181,zeljan,Please make it stop,1,24 April 2013,"I anticipated wonderful images of Tolstoy's Russia in beautiful HD format with solid acting and great depth of feeling. I did not expect to see a sardonic Broadway play committed to film. But that's what I got. There are those who believe me unsophisticated for not 'appreciating' the artistic license taken in the presentation of this film. Baloney. As a general rule, I love classics and period pieces. However, this movie reminded me of a disjointed circus act that was both frustrating and disappointing. I felt like my endurance for the ridiculous was being tested. My husband and I could not get through it and turned it off at the halfway point. I was relieved to stop watching it.",Anna Karenina

A few times I just put the thing on mute and played some Beatle's music behind it.Poor Aaron Taylor-Johnson looked lost in the shuffle of pinafores and taffeta and dizzy dames mooning over him.He reminded me of something out of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band-he was definitely more suited to doing John Lennon in Nowhere Boy and should never have been brought into Knightly's creepy spider web of Imperial misery.This is an affront to Tolstoy and to the original classic that should have been left to be the only piece that Leo could take pride in.",Anna Karenina

184,kathryn-org,"If the movie, Moulin Rouge and ten chapters from the novel, ""Anna Karennina"" had an affair and a baby out of wedlock....",4,29 April 2016,"You would get this movie. I admit that I am biased because I have always loved the book. And I can't imagine what it might be like for someone who has no experience with the novel. Maybe they would like the story? But I found the change of scenes to really take away from the story line. It was overly artistic and inconveniently distracting. (This being an issue because I love the story so much.) I liked how free and open the outdoor scenes were. And I think the director actually did an honest job covering the story. I agree with the claustrophobic feeling and while I found myself suffering through it, I also wonder if the director wanted us to feel that way- to maybe connect ourselves to Anna's feelings? I hope it was on purpose. It was still horrible to suffer through though. I have to agree that the actor chosen as Vronsky was just a terrible choice. Yikes!! There didn't seem to be any real chemistry at all between them- oddly completely on his side. (Keira knightly seems to have really tried to add some feels- Whatever chemistry that was there was fully carried by her. (He honestly had more chemaitey with his horse. And with his male friends.) Keira knightly probably wasn't the perfect choice either. Although I love her when she is in the right roles for her. She can be wonderful on screen. And maybe if she had had chemistry with vronsky (his fault!) then.... Who knows. But girl to girl... No girl would like Vronsky anyway.. And she had to kiss that tweenager mustache so she is forgiven. For me, the story alone has enough drama to read and reread again and again throughout a persons life. . I wish the art of this movie had been in how well the story was told. And I wish it had been done in a more organic, simple manner. In summation: poorly cast and over worked. The writer and director did an honest job of attempting to keep the integrity of the story. Beautiful costumes. But I wish I had spent the evening steaming Downton Abbey instead of watching this.",Anna Karenina
185,movie-111,Style over substance,3,16 September 2012,"I went to see the film in the hope of being absorbed and immersed in a great story with great characters. Unfortunately Joe Wright's desperate attempt to do something different completely destroyed any real engagement with the characters; each time I started to get involved, another trick theatrical effect came along and spoiled the moment. If I want to see a stage play with curtains opening, scenery moving around and toy trains, I go to a theatre: if I go to a cinema, I want to see a film. All the acting performances were excellent, no complaint, but this was the worst kind of self indulgent ""I want to get critical plaudits"" direction possible. If told as a straight narrative this could have been a great film: as it is, it's extremely clever but extremely annoying.",Anna Karenina
186,Leigh2013,Cheap,6,1 March 2013,"I'm one of those annoying people who read the book, so you know what I think. This movie isn't the right scale, for one thing. Actually, they didn't even try to make it into a real place. In the book, you knew you were in Russia, big ole Mother Russia. Everything's far away, and the buildings, the coaches, and the landscapes were gigantic and filled with people. But, in the movie, they were pulling away screens like you were at a play. I could scream. In the book, that horse race was long, sweaty, dirty, and loud. That's Vronsky's pet horse, and he can feel something go wrong with her (the only time I felt sorry for him). In the movie, it was two seconds, and they weren't even outside. Second, what were those dances? I want someone to tell me when they did that in Russia. It made it weird instead of beautiful. Third, the guy who played Levin was wrong; he was a bear of a man. He was a picture of Tolstoy himself. Fourth, why didn't they use voice-overs for internal dialog? There was so much lost without it. I know they couldn't get nearly 1,000 pages on screen, but they could've tried harder and not made it look so cheap. On the bright side, the characterization is good, and the main plot lines are there. So if you want the story without any nuances, this'll get it.",Anna Karenina
187,inga-kupp,Brilliant and unique movie version!,10,11 February 2013,"My review: When I entered the movie theater, I knew a lot about Tolstoy's book, but nothing about this specific movie release. I knew who were starring the movie and that was it. Usually, when going to see movies, I always check out trailers and features and interviews before actually seeing them on the big screen, but this time the title of the movie was plainly enough. I have been a big fan of classical Russian literature from very young age, so I thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong in many levels.When the opening scenes were over, I knew that this movie was very different from any other movie version of Anna Karenina. Well, it was different from any movie based on classical literary fiction! It was mesmerizing and I was hooked from the first minutes and I did not want to leave the dark room of the theater even when the credentials were running and most of the people were leaving the room. I wanted to stay in the world that the movie makers had created! Screenplay: Let me start with saying, that screenwriter Tom Stoppard kept the story very close to its original and I was very happy about it! It seemed that there was a clear understanding between the late Lev Tolstoy and the screenwriter Tom Stoppard. There were only very few places in the story when I realized, that it is slightly different from the original and even that was falling nicely to its place in the movie.The story was dramatic, heart-wrenching and beautifully executed! It's an epic forbidden love story which takes place in the Russian aristocracy. Anna Karenina is unhappily married, but she has no greater expectations to love, at least until she meets Count Vronsky. The moment they meet, there is attraction and as much as they try to deny it, it is inevitable. It's forbidden love in the society, because Anna decides to leave her husband and asks for divorce. As the isolation from friends, family and everybody else for Anna grows, the more consumed she is by darkness. Karenin does not give her divorce and it does not matter how big the love is between Vronsky and Anna, it gets dramatic consequences.Directing, sets, visuals, choreography, design and music: What made this movie exceptionally unique was the fact, that director Joe Wright staged it on a theater. Watching the movie was like watching a theater stage where the scenes were elegantly changed as the story folded out in front of the audience. Scene after scene the settings were changed even though the room was the same. It was original and I loved it. I also realized the the only sets which were used outside of theater were about Levin and his life on the countryside. This change was nicely balanced where you had the hectic life of Sct. Petersburg and Moscow in one side and the picturesque and slow scenes from Russian nature.There was a lot of attention on choreography and physical contact in Anna Karenina. It was a movie where choreography was a main storyteller. It was often where choreography was substituting words and you can say that in Anna Karenina a picture told more than 1000 words. The ballroom dancing and even a simple touch was sometimes telling more than words. It was tense and filled with passion. Another thing which was special in Anna Karenina, were the close-ups. The facial impressions were as important as the huge scenes with many people.One of the interesting visuals were the usage of lightning and colors. For example there was a clear contrasts when Anna was together with Vronsky compared to when she was with Karenin. The scenes where Anna and Vronsky spend time together are brighter and softer, and the scenes at home with Karenin, the lightning is murkier and darker. It gave some nice effects to the plot and to the mood.I would also like to mention the design of the costumes and the music in the movie. The costumes were breathtakingly beautiful, especially the ones designed for Anna and Kitty and the music was coherent with the development of the story: the intensity of which grew in the rhythm with the drama surrounding it.Casting and ensemble: I liked the characters picked for the roles. Keira Knightly as Anna Karenina was a good choice. She was capable of mirroring Anna Karenina's essence showing both love, passion, courage, pain and last but not least jealousy. When Anna is consumed by isolation and jealousy and realization that the society will never forgive her, Keira Knightly gave her best to show these different reflections of woman in love and pain. I liked that a lot! Jude Law as Karenin was faceted. I liked that he did not show Karenin as a simple man. He loved Anna on his own way and I liked that Jude Law showed his soft side combined with the religious and hurtful side. I really enjoyed the way he played Karenin.I was surprised by Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky. I have seen him in Nowhere Boy and realized that fact actually after the movie. He has matured as actor and he as Vronsky was a very good choice. He showed passion, tenderness, love and passion of a man in love.Another surprise was Alicia Vikander as Kitty. This Swedish actress was perfect to the role. I was amazed by her grace when she played in A Royal Affair where I was stunned by her presence in acting. I loved her as Kitty, she had spark and feisty and humbleness when she met Levin after denying him as a husband.I also enjoyed performances of Domhnall Gleeson as Levin and Matthew Macfadyen as Oblonski.Dislikes: The only minor thing that I was disturbed by and it was how the Russian names were pronounced.",Anna Karenina
188,redtulipsg,"Actors are brilliant, everything else is not",5,10 September 2012,"I am Russian, I have read the novel and I have seen 4 other versions of it (my favourite is with Sophie Marceau - but not perfect too). I gave this film 5 stars out of 10 because although the actors were brilliant, I didn't quite like the way the events were portrayed. For example the ball - they did not dance like that!; the houses - dark mess or messy darkness; and the whole theatrical set did not appeal to me at all. It would look great on stage but in a film I think it spoils the story. I saw it as a play, not as a supposedly real story. A few important bits were missed out (Vronskiy's attempted suicide, Kitty giving birth and one of the last scenes in the book when Vronskiy sees dead Anna). In a word, I found it too theatrical and surreal, was expecting a more realistic version. On the other hand, we've had realistic versions (Vivien Leigh, Greta Garbo, Sophie Marceau).",Anna Karenina
189,karkushkino-539-95585,for a viewer and a reviewer,8,26 November 2012,"I was really afraid to see this movie after several negative reviews and some positive, i was afraid to be irritated (worst thing that happens to you while watching movie, cause you cannot even fall asleep that you really want, irritation doesn't let you).. and i was really delighted after 10 min of watching a movie, cause it's DIFFERENT from my expectations, and you don't even think of criticizing.The director gave us a free narration, and it has several beneficial clues: dynamic, not a web of events but a streaming plot, scenery (not even the view but idea (sailor playing, ball in a shabby hall - i don't know why Mr wright came up with it, theatrical performance, and carpenters changing scenery), actors - LOVED ALL. if not to think that in the book Anna was quite plump. and i liked vronskiy - not a boy but not yet a man.. really a desperate person with burning heart, ambitious, sincere, LOVING, passionate, carp diem but serious in liaison. that what i saw in Aaron. he is a good match. and i SEE why wanna Anna fell in love with him. was upset that didn't see Anna's daughter, she is a fruit and a key to understanding of Anna's heart. hope Kira had bigger boobs, sometimes looked like from a Paris fashion week, that skinny. wrong impression of Levin's attitude: he was so contradictory in his family feeling, but on the screen like a pastoral song - light and smooth. NOT AT ALL. Stiva charming. Dolly is suffering and loving. Karenin is Jude law. i saw Jude law . not Karen. but liked it, excusing myself that it's a free interpretation. good understanding of key moments in a book and immediate response to them in a movie. and of course you Don't see Tolstoy there. just on the surface of the surface. that far. several really serious wrong impressions (Levin story, vronskiy was crystal faithful with Anna, and some small moments, but those two i cant digest). really nice Russian folk on the background.",Anna Karenina
190,MrBanBan,an adulterous take on a story of adultery,1,20 December 2015,"To quote Anna at the train stop meeting with Vronsky, ""This is WRONG!"" And it is. It is as if the director, Joe Wright, decided to intentionally make a film about adultery, by creating an adultery himself of it, and making us feel how wrong it is. It worked. The cast, I thought, worked. The costumes, the sets, the music. The director however makes it into a Chekhovian farce/drama, limiting character development, and ""opening out"" the novel tremendously. This is not a faithful adaptation - this film is as adulterous as you can have it. If that was the point it worked. Because, as others pointed out - the themes are there (even to Karenin's ears!). but because the focus is adultery (over and over) starting from the first one (with the governess) & it renders the film - generic. In other words it becomes: all stories of adultery are unhappy in the same way, and told the same, have the same characters, and become clichés of each other. That is actually true to the first sentence in the novel, because in the end ALL UNHAPPY families are EXACTLY the same, that's what Tolstoy really is trying to show. Still, I can't watch it, can't beat the Russian '67 version, it's all the 'opening out' and editing, and shooting, and the fast paced dialogue. The novel is very suspenseful, mysterious, leaves room for reflection, this doesn't. I suppose I have to try to remember Anna's advice in this case: ""if you are a good man you'll forget everything"". The dancing was good, great neo-classical ballet sequences, etc, but it's like I'm watching something else and not A.K. awful.",Anna Karenina
191,artefakt-634-847546,Comics based on Anna Karenina novel,3,16 March 2013,"To be short, I was disappointed. I couldn't watch this movie until end.Some actors are playing well but some (including Anna Karenina) are absolutely out of context. More, the movie has no context, so it is not actors fault. The movie looks like a comics based on Anna Karenina novel. I watched recently ""War and world"" (named as ""war and piece"" by mistake), it was 200% better! About historical costumes & background: the movie is too British. Some decorations are not Russian - like, it looks more like Asia or India (we are using decorations that we have available?). Too much bright colors, gold, red.I understand that this movie is interpretation, but in this case it should not pretend to be historical movie. Fast changes of decorations & movie style will work better for comedy or operetta, it is hard to concentrate attention. 1. Visit Russia, museum, old places, read books. It is boring, but it helps. 2. Try to do your work better, became a good producer and actor.This movie looks like attempt to make quick money.3. Don't break if it is working - interpretation of great novel is risky business, you must be capable to create similar product or your interpretation will be a spoof...PS - Moscow and St Petersburg (-4 Fahrenheit) are not Eastern Siberia(below -40 Fahrenheit).Peasants did not wear red coats in winter - they are not members of the secret order and this is not a movie about elves.It like to see James Bond in a fur hat with ear flaps with a red star... Afroamericans are rare in Russia now and were extremely rare in XIX century Russia. Again, it is not Britain or USA.Puffer can't be covered by snow, it is warm (technically, it is very big stove); wagons can be covered by snow (most wagons had heaters inside) but most snow will blow away when train moves).Sorry for my English.",Anna Karenina
192,pantelicmina,Beautiful but shallow,7,6 December 2013,"First of all i would like to say a word or two about that ""Slavic's soul"". Well, there is no such thing.I read all critics and they were all like "" Movie didn't catch Slavic's or Russian spirit"" It is very natural and normal that role of Elizabeth Bennet suits Keira perfect,unlike the role of Anna. Because she grew up with that character she knows how she breath, what moves her etc. I grew up, on the other hand, with Anna. Essays, tests, playing roles, hours of talking, looong and exhausting discussion about characters and writer. I was 16... and all i could see was story of love, passion and stupidity of moral and law regulations of that time. Back then i would be blown away with this movie. BUT i read it again,couple of years ago,and... well how can i put it ..hmm there is nothing to do with love passion etc. Everyone who reads Tolstoy knows that. In this adaptation we miss that, that important part of the novel, which reflected in character of Levin. Through the whole movie i had a feeling that this is a tribute to Anna Karenina,not a serious and meaningful attempt to get to the essence of the novel and characters. Beautiful,enchanting,divine tribute, but only that. So, if someone do his job bad, and that job is to make the adapted screenplay, you cannot say "" Ohh they don't understand our soul"" it is not so complicated and mystic.",Anna Karenina
193,marlenebjornsen-24-939666,"If the book is nearly as good as the movie, it must be a masterpiece",6,15 February 2015,"I have always loved watching movies that are dated to times that I've never had the opportunity to explore myself. Big historical events, people, places and movies with some historical context. But this was a rather different movie than I first thought it was going to be.I've always enjoyed watching Keira Knightley's acting, and she's good in this movie too. I know that Anna Karenina isn't a real person, but there's just something about the Russian history and their culture that has always fascinated me. When I read about this movie, and the book behind it, I was really interested in the fact that many think that the character is based on different historical women. While watching the movie you'll have to pay close attention, because there's a lot going on, a lot of dialogue and a lot of symbols and weird things going on. For example, the whole movie is like played on a stage. Often you can see that they are carrying in and out props, scenes go from one place to another place with just a small adjustment to the walls around or the lights. It's simply a masterpiece, and never boring to watch. It portrays a woman's love affair, but there's so much more to the movie than that. There's happy marriages, adultery, sexuality, country life, politics, masculinity, femininity, individuality, conformity, altruism, love, death, longing and success. There's so many themes, so many different characters, and so much to explain I won't even go to the details because there's so much. The movie is adapted from the book Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, which is a book I really want to read now because the movie was amazing. It was first published as a book in 1878, so it's old, but if the book is anywhere near the movie it have to be a masterpiece.",Anna Karenina

This movie is really badly cast and the style may work as a theater production but is very very disappointing. I can hardly believe what the way that they managed to ruin such a wonderful piece of literature, which, treated with the correct respect could have made for a masterpiece. The characters were all flat with none of the richness of the book, and Vronski in particular was completely unconvincing as a magnetic and powerful playboy.

196,composertrevor,"Creative and inventive, but another version of Anna Karenina?",8,20 July 2015,"I have been a fan of Joe Wright and his collaborations with Keira Knightly, and also with costume designer Jacqueline Durran and set designer Sarah Greenwood ever since their work on 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Atonement'. There comes a point in film making when studios, directors, producers and other team members have to ask themselves why they are making yet another adaptation of a timeless classic. The principal answer I can find here is that they have made a fantasy on Anna Karenina. I am all for creativity and invention, and this version certainly contained those elements. This version has to be viewed as a fantasy because that was the only direction a director and writer could go in after the other 'by the book' versions. There was also the issue of budget which made it necessary to focus on a mainly studio version. I think the old novels have had enough treatment by film makers, and that newer books work better. 'Atonement' is a classic example of how a recent novel can be enhanced by a film version. Overall, the film was colourful and inventive, with a good cast. Avoid novels that have already been adapted until a long time has lapsed.",Anna Karenina

198,Bread_Pit,Disappointing,6,24 July 2021,"After reading the book, I wanted to see a film adaptation. Of course, I didn't expect it to be precise. At the same time, I didn't know it would look as hasty. I'm not complaining about them not showing all the moments from the book. It'd be impossible to fit a 860-page book in one movie. What I'm saying is that they could've done it so that events didn't appear so speedy. Because everything is so hasty, it doesn't look believable. There's no true chemistry between the characters.Also, because of hastiness, the appearance of some characters doesn't make sense. They show up for a couple of scenes, and if they hadn't been in the film, nothing would've changed.To summarize, it would've been better if they'd added fewer moments from the book but filmed them with proper tempo.I liked the actors though, except Keira. She doesn't seem like a good Anna to me. She's not believable in this role.",Anna Karenina

202,Emmaskeats,Anna Karenina Review,9,26 October 2015,"The plot- mainly following Anna- Keira Knightley- clearly not in a particularly happy marriage, with a young child who she dotes on. She takes a trip to visit her brother and his family after hearing a slight scandal and at a local party- bumps in to the ever so dashing Vronsky- Aaron Taylor- Johnson. They immediately spark and gain a few remarks from local friends and relatives on their chemistry. An affair begins, and we see their whirlwind passion develop and see how it effects the other characters who get involved in their indiscretions. The parts I love best about this movie- are the sets and costumes! The attention to detail blew me away and the cast are all sublime to watch- Keira Knightley wearing her period costumes with such elegance and grace. It is all staged mostly like it is all within a theatre, with sets moving around and the cast dancing along through each set change. It all looks fantastic! Macfadyen, Macdonald and Law are all fantastic characters- played very well, and the rest of the supporting cast all work perfectly together.",Anna Karenina
203,anitaspinks,An Opera Without the Singing.,8,16 February 2013,"This production of ""Anna Karenina"" appeared to be an impressionistic opera without the singing. Joe Wright managed to capture the feelings and sense of place, with great economy ( a difficult task when putting such a lengthy novel, on film). I think this is always a great challenge to a producer, but to my thinking , he pulled it off.Contrary to most, dare I add male, reviewers, I thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson was very well cast as the handsome Vronsky. He looked wonderful on film, and the stylised poses seemed in keeping with the whole operatic sensibility being created. Jude Law did his piece with the aplomb one would expect of such an experienced actor. My only quibble with the casting was that of Keira Knightly herself. This is merely a personal preference , as she doesn't particularly appeal to me, but Joe Wright is obviously a great fan as he has used her in two other films. We're all entitled to our individual choices, are we not?The entire film kept me riveted. As Anna descended into her own , personal hell, I was with her all the way. I felt for them all. There were no ""bad guys"", just victims of the times.",Anna Karenina
204,gingerolive,Ridiculous Nonsensical Yet Beautiful Crap,1,23 November 2012,"Despite the title, let me begin anew by stating that I absolutely love Joe Wright. He makes beautiful films, and this one is not the exception. However, the script was nonsensical and lacked any sort of sensitivity or heart (why is Anna even supposed to fall for Vronsky in this version? And, why should we care? this movie did not give us reason to do so), (most of) the acting (save Macfadyen, Macdonald, Williams, and sometimes Taylor- Johnson) was ridiculous and over-the-top, and the encompassing of the theater - while a brilliant idea - was completely lacking for an on-screen venture.This was basically a myriad of fashion photo-shoots for Miss Knightley. Should've just been a cheesy commercial itself.And, I consider this a travesty considering that this review is coming from a moviegoer who absolutely adores Matthew Macfadyen, Jude Law, and Kelly Macdonald, who are all great actors.

I recommend you have your remote control handy if you intend to watch this travesty. Picture Moulin Rouge without the soundtrack then replace the script with one written by the Police Academy team, and you'll have the measure of this. The tone is wrong from the first second. Why replace beautiful 19th century Moscow/ St Petersburg with a play set? Even the costume and set seem to wrankle, is it set pre 1900 or post, the set seems to suggest post? Would a princess or countess share seats in a public carriage on the train, it seems unlikely. This story needed no embellishment but the film has it in spades, if only they had been used to bury it!

A great cast poorly used in a pretentious adaptation. Jude Law did well with the material given. Keira Knightley, always a pleasure to look at, was miscast in this one. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky reminded me of Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein. The switch from stage play scenario to movie scenario only confused the plot. Thank God Tolstoy is not alive to seek legal recourse. I wonder how IMDb could give this film a 7.0. Some nice visuals all that can be said in its defense.",Anna Karenina
207,silvetka2001,It's the best adaption which could happen to a novel as frigid as that - it's only that you have to give it a second watch!,8,20 January 2013,"The first watch of this movie definitely didn't catch my heart or stop my breath but when I gave it a second chance of detailed and careful observation I really fell for it. The point is that Wright's approach puts passion, glamor and attractiveness in a story which is basically quite boring and even dull (why the whole world is so crazy about it and it is on the top of the ""love stories of all times"" lists will always stay a mystery to me). I remember it was pain reading the book and although I focused entirely upon the two separate love story lines and neglected the rest, the novel seemed to be endless. Surely this adaptation is the best which could happen to a novel as frigid as that. The most important aspects are well represented and for sure it's not a loss that the socially-political traits are omitted. The concept of the ""damned"" love which is dominantly featured in the movie goes with magnificent exposal of temptation, passion, ambivalence in feelings and riot against the hypocrisy in society. Of course, Keira's absolutely inappropriate for this role and so is Aaron Taylor-Johnson for the personage of Vronsky. But in general their performance is not that bad and at least both are adorably beautiful. It should be noted that Jude Law is the best Karenin I could ever imagine. Furthermore,the costumes of all and especially Anna's jewelry are exquisite and honestly, I don't care whether they belong to the years they are supposed to. After all, no one claimed for pursuit of authenticity.",Anna Karenina

While I rarely leave movies early, had my wife not been with me, I would have left Anna. Found the ever changing stage sets to be distracting throughout the movie, and felt they interrupted what few scenes worked. Felt no sympathy for the two lovers, a bit for Jude Law. Both his character and the fact that he seems to be the only one of the main characters not focused on looking glamorous. Tolstoy must have rolled over in his stage grave.

It looks great , and after all, you have paid rather a lot for it. But once it's over, no matter how much you try to convince yourself that it wasn't THAT bad, and maybe it's your fault you didn't enjoy it, it leaves you completely unsatisfied, and longing for a hearty pot roast about as much as you're longing for that infernal train to hit Anna and her Backstreet Boy - clone Vronsky, in the first half hour of the movie. The characters were THAT soulless, emotionless and unbelievable.Which is in itself astonishing. Keira Knightley was superb in Atonement. Ditto Ruth Wilson in the BBC's Jane Eyre. No comment on McFadyen since his Darcy was lukewarm anyway, and as for Aaron Whatshisface...never seen him before and devoutly hope never to see him again. However. And it's a big however. I can't praise Jude Law enough for a sensitive, nuanced and utterly believable performance that was miles away from his usual charming rake, and therefore all the more impressive. Honestly, I was rooting for him to just LEAVE Anna without a second glance in the first ten minutes!In summary...if you want to watch beautiful costumes and weird hand- waving choreography, watch a broadcast of any random high-profile fashion show instead. At least it won't lure you in by pretending to have a story.",Anna Karenina
210,sunrunner,Failed Attempt,2,15 March 2014,"Director, Joe Wright, tried to put a fresh new face on Tolstoy's classic novel, and may have been influenced by the style of a Baz Luhrmann, but while Mr. Luhrmann's may have created an exciting alternative version, unfortunately Mr. Wright's vision is misguided. How does a director have in his hands one of the great novels of civilization, and a $70 million dollar budget and turn it into a disaster? There is always room for a sincere attempts at alternative versions, but Mr. Wright's concept seems to be a parody. Karenina is a 'period piece' and has to be since if one tried to modernize the story Anna would just file for divorce - no shame in today's society. To add a framework inside a stage show may be clever for something else, but not for this novel. The screen writer, Tom Stoppard, has been successfully inventive in past films and stage, and perhaps he brought a bit of the theatricality to this film, if so, then he shares part of the culpability. There's also very little Russian passion in this film, but more British stiff upper lip. Mr. Wright directed the actors to be stiff throughout to a point where the actors are at times actually frozen in place on the screen (and there are several tableaux), but grafting modern cinematic technique to a classic work just doesn't work in this film. The choreography was skillful, however they didn't dance that way in 1874, and certainly not full lifts across the dance floor (that might have been more shocking than divorce). Again, the style of choreography would be a director's decision. Kudos to Jude Law who gives the film class, and Keira Knightley who is always delightful to look at. Count Alexei Vronsky; however, is miscast; he is debonair, but not dashing enough to believe he could sweep the beautiful and rich Anna to reckless exile from imperial society. (Think of a young Omar Sharif as the Count.) The costumes, particularly Ms. Knightley's costumes are wonderful, although her costumes do not seem to fit the period, but that also may be Mr. Wright's vision. The cinematography is brilliant.",Anna Karenina

The moment Kiera Knightly appeared on the screen, all bets were off and from that point forward, I found myself increasingly irritated with the over-the-top production values, The cheap looking Ralph Lauren jewelry and Anna's costumes. When Vronsky showed up I was taken aback by his lack of virility. Here's a man who is supposed to love the army but he looks more like a model that was ripped from the pages of W magazine. Neither Anna nor Vronsky could muster up any real passion for each other. They were like two icebergs floating around each other but never really connecting. I stopped caring about Anna at the ball because unlike Greta Garbo and Vivian Leigh who were able to pull off so well the conflicted feelings of Anna, Knightly came across as nothing more than a mean girl in high school. I tried to stay with it for a while but the longer I watched it, the more I hated it. the one exception was Jude Law as Anna's husband. At least he brought a sense of real human feelings to his role.

Without a single scene in the theatre: I didn't like the way it was made at all.I remember thinking that the backstage door is a Narnian gateway that everyone uses to enter and exit the stage. blah blah blah.

These are easily Knightly's and Law's best film performances and the acting of almost the whole cast is extremely good. The role of Levin played by Gleeson is brilliant.The book is actually my favourite book of all time and this is the first adaptation which I believe has captured the spirit of the film. The tragedy of Anna, the sympathy that one feels for the Karenin and the pureness of Levin's love for Kitty are all evoked beautifully.In some ways the audience is made to work with the film to really get the most out of it but the magic drew me in very quickly and the claustrophobic nature of imperial Russian society was clearly demonstrated within the overall metaphor.Is this film going to be appreciated by fans of the Expendables - probably not! However I am a fan of many films including the Transporter series and whilst Anna Karenina may not have many thrills it is good honest story telling at one level and a great film to make one think.

217,swaminc,Tolstoi's Ana Karenina based on a digest for a middle school,2,25 November 2012,"This new ""adaptation"" is nonsense. Tolstoy's novel is about a woman who belonged to the upper class that governed the Great Russia, the country extending from Atlantic Ocean to Pacific Ocean, from Arctics to Afghanistan. Why is that Vonsky's mother, a princess by the title, is sharing a bench with senator Karenin's wife in a second class car where her son, price Vronsky finds them somewhere between third and the 4th raw? Their wealth allowed them to travel in a separate car and they often did! We were told from the screen that it was Russia of 1874. Well then how comes that Anna's ""son"" plays with train toys that run... on batteries? The cancan was normal for the working-class ballrooms of Montparnasse, but not for the aristocracy of Russian Empire exactly because it contradicted to aristocratic education and highly developed sense of taste. And amidst all of this nonsense we hear a bunch of ""sub–Russian"" ""aj-lu-lu"" songs that would be appropriate for the poor villagers but not for the Russian Aristocracy of this time. The movie appears to be staged in the backstage of a Café chantant. I was shocked to see that there is a hen sitting on the bookcase in Oblonsky's study. And why the Karenin's bedroom is situated in a huge hall with many columns in it? And his servants dressed as servants in bistro? Servants of aristocracy had to wear ""la livrea"", a livery, a uniform! I have impression that ladies jewelries were rented from a local Macy's store, while the entire picture was filmed in an abandoned provincial theater with broken walls and bad floor. And please notice that soup Marie-Louise is always with asparagus, so it is as inappropriate to mention this to the guests of Stiva Oblonsky's dinner. Extremely bad taste is obvious from about all scenes of the film. But so is the idea of this movie. We were offered just another attempt to present an adultère with a little bit attachment to un époux Russe. Unlike the world of commoners, Anna was not granted the freedom of choice because her divorce and remarriage was to be approved by the Most Holly Sinod, and the divorce lawyer, who was omitted from the film, was quite clear about this issue in his conversation with Karenin. This is why the drama had to be moved from the formal level to individual qualities of the people involved. And the only one who in my opinion reached this goal on behalf of Tolsoy was Jude Law, who was excellent as new Karenin lacking the common impression of a ridiculed husband. I understand that the ""stamping"" clerks from Oblonsky's office was added to the whole venture by Mrs. Wright and Stoppard as a token of their appreciation of Russian Avant-garde theatre, but it only enhanced the feeling of totally lost control over the flow of the drama. I am greatly disappointed. In my opinion, this film lacks good taste, understanding of Tolstoy's original idea, understanding of the characters, the time and circumstances of the drama, which together constitute a minimum requirement for a fair cinematography for classics adaptation. Don't even think to offer this thing to Russian viewers, because it will cause nothing but a belly laugh. Try to find and enjoy the Anna Karenina (1967) directed by great Aleksandr Zarkhi: this is a true piece of art, colorful and careful to every detail, the highest expression of a family drama without exits that explains its tragic end.",Anna Karenina

219,edwardwhitbread,"A bold, daring, and different cinematic vision from Joe Wright",8,4 October 2012,"Anna Karenina Confession: OK, I haven't read the book. Alright? I know people that didn't like this movie will just tell me it's because it didn't do justice to the book. Let's just be clear though: a book is a book and a film is a film and any attempt of one to fully to justice to the other will not work.Anna Karenina stars Keira Knightley as the disloyal beauty Anna Karenina who falls for the dashing Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson: that's correct, the one from Kick Ass) and in doing so shames her dutiful husband (played superbly by Jude Law). The film has a fantastic supporting cast that includes Emily Watson and Mathew Macfadyen. And then, of course, the marriage made in heaven, Tom Stoppard and Joe Wright, the writer of Shakespeare in love and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead and the director of Atonement and Hanna. This team, together, produced something that I think was rather special.The film is so curiously different from the very beginning and one's attention is immediately grabbed. The characters seem to be immersed in a theatrical world where sets and scenes unashamedly change before our very eyes. There is something incredibly sincere in this method, the film allows you to see that it is, of course a film and not a picture of a different reality. It does not try to deceive us into a suspension of disbelief but rather amaze and let us focus on the message of the movie, itself.That isn't to say that the plot isn't deep and layered – to the contrary, there is so many themes and ideas at play, here, that one leaves the cinema still thinking. For example a great emphasis is placed on Anna's religious guilt. There is a scene with Vronsky where they are lying in a deserted forest. She claims that no-one can see them and just to be sure, she looks left, right, backwards and forward, before pausing for a beat and looking up. She fears God not because of his wrath and power but because He threatens what she loves most in life: Vronsky. Then there is the character Levin, a friend of Anna's brother, who provides something of a philosophical commentary on the narrative. He believes in family values, a monogamous and holy existence, and where Anna's love story is dangerous and doomed for failure, his is charming and beautiful.Needless to say, the acting was perfect. I would be shocked if Miss Knightley did not have an Oscar nomination for best actress and Mathew Macfadyen for best supporting actor. The best performance of the film, however, came from Jude Law who was scarily perfect as Alexei Karenina, the boring but loving husband of Anna.This film has been criticised for holding style above substance. I disagree entirely: it could have been an ordinary period drama but instead turned itself into a bold and different cinematic vision. You will not be disappointed.",Anna Karenina
220,r-whalley,poor Tolstoy,1,8 March 2013,About 15min into this movie I wanted to turn it off but decided to give it a fair chance. After my high hopes for one of the best novels ever written my opinion is now that Tolstoy would be rolling in his grave at the awful interpretation of his book. The film is done in a slight Baz Lurman style but would even offend those fans with its confusing scene changes and lack of scripting. I managed to make it through half of the film before I decided I was wasting my time and I'm writing this review to warn others. It is obvious why this film went to DVD so quickly and why it did neither Keira Knightly nor the ever bland Jude Law's careers and favors.

221,aaalex888,Are you serious?,3,9 January 2013,"Never wrote a review before, didn't ever wanna start with a negative one. But it just hurts to feel so ripped off...This one is just another failure to make a movie out of a great classical novel. Who didn't read the book, you don't know what you're talking about saying the movie is good. They say you should take the movie as a movie, as an individual artwork. But how if it's BASED on a book you already read and love? If the people who made the movie CHOSE to take that novel for the script. Why couldn't they just take more simple material that matches their abilities and talent more? Why take such a great piece of art and try to do something else with it? As many people already said, it's lack of substance and depth in the movie. Well, to me it's more like lack of understanding the original story in first place. The novel is not even about Anna and Vronsky. On my opinion it's so wrong to wrap it all around them two, make it into a cheap ordinary romance and leave some very important characters and story lines out. The novel is just roughly stripped. Once again, write your own story, it would work better. Characters were very fake, I didn't see Anna Karenina, but I saw Keira Knightly trying to play her, and there was no Vronsky at all in the movie. Jude Law and Domhnall Gleeson were the only part that was believable and good in the whole thing.My two stars are for them. Jude Law surprised me, it was very unexpected from him to play the role like that, and he did a very good job. And Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) was quite amazing, it's shame they didn't give him more time. It's sad because these actors could be in so much better of a project with these characters.I like Aaron Taylor-Johnson as an actor, but he was out of place here.They could at least leave him his natural color hair...But most of the character's emotions were coming from nowhere, from a raw director's command I guess.Visual part was just horrible. Even if I distract myself from the book, it's still awful. Whats the story that all these fancy moves of camera trying to tell? Who are these people on the screen? Why do they act the way they act? It's so shallow. Some shots just feel absolutely with no purpose. Just LOOKS stupid. Another try to be special? Trying to show off your movie-making skills? It doesn't add anything to the story, it does no effect for bringing it out to the viewer's hearts. Maybe cause it's done with no heart? The whole theatrical thing is really stupid. We could go to a theater instead of movies, you know. And if it's something they got from the novel, trying to show some kind of inner perception of it,make it a metaphor, then it's a total failure, because it was never a play in the book. Every character is very realistic and alive in the book, very psychologically organized, every step and every emotion and thought is REAL in the book. But not in this movie...it's just looks fake and stupid, the feelings of the movie characters don't make any sense, they are illogical and just overplayed.I won't even say anything about matching the time period,history and culture cause they obviously didn't even try to point that aspect in the movie. It was also stripped... It's just empty, lame try to jump over your head. No meaning, no taste, no style, no talent.",Anna Karenina
222,marlenep22,A sorry tale,3,25 September 2012,I went to see Anna Karenina today - what a disappointment!. Firstly the staging of the film in an old fashioned theatre took away from the reality of the story. Anna Karenina - one of the greatest love stories ever told. I wish I'd pushed the director off his chair and directed it myself. I could have done a better job. I do not blame Keira Knightly who acted her socks off and seemed to be the only person in the film who really believed in herself or cared. Aaron Johnson was wooden and I did not believe that he loved her- the writing was on the wall that he was going to let her down from when you first saw him. His character and personality are much more complex in the book and much more passionate. I wonder if Johnson had read the book? Jude Law even came across as wooden - and he was so terrific in Sherlock Holmes - again I blame the director. In fact it seemed like a lavish epic where someone had told them to cut back on locations - so they used a toy train instead of a real one and some old theatres. So take a leaf out of Dr Zhivago's book - watch this truly epic film which will show you how to convey passion and devotion in Russia.With Anna Karenina you bit off more than you could chew.,Anna Karenina
223,sarah_in_space,Spectacular spectacular!,8,21 September 2012,"After 2011's psycho-coming-of-age story 'Hanna' and 2009's inspirational rags to riches tale 'The Soloist' Joe Wright returns to his cinematic roots with Keira Knightley and a sumptuous period drama. Keira is cast as Anna, a bored trophy wife to stuffy government official, Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin (Jude Law looking uncharacteristically severe). Part of the Russian aristocratic circle Anna lives for her son, Seryozha, and various social functions where she can sparkle in a series of gorgeous gowns (look out for the ruffled bustled affair in purple silk with which she opens the film - stunning). Until one day she encounters a pretty young military officer, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), at the same time as witnessing a horrific railway accident. After further meetings with Vronsky she becomes obsessed with him and begins a dangerous affair which exposes the double-standards in late 19th Century high society.Having never seen Anna Karenina before, or read the book, I can't tell you whether Wright has managed a faithful adaptation but I can confirm that he's constructed an absorbing and thoroughly entertaining one. Due to budget constraints while filming almost the entire story takes place within an abandoned theatre. This means that Wright has to be both cunning and creative. The first act in particular is delightfully theatrical - pieces of set are whisked past and around the camera to create different locations, characters change costume in front of us, and the actors almost dance through scenes with every move choreographed to perfection. It almost feels like a musical and the feel of it is very Baz Luhrmann and so won't be to everyone's tastes but it utterly enchanted me. As the story progresses and the rigid rules and expectations beneath this apparently enchanted life are revealed we move away from the safe confines of the theatre and the sets become starker and more realistic. Personally I think this was a genius move by Wright, the transition from theatricality to realism reflects Anna's journey and realisation of how her actions will affect her apparently perfect life.Despite the increasingly heavygoing story the cast are able to have a lot of fun with the characters and the early theatrical scenes. Matthew Macfadyen as Anna's jolly brother, Stiva, bristles comically from beneath and enormous Baltic moustache, and Jude Law leaves us in no doubt as to why Anna is bored of her marriage to him. The moment where he delicately removes an ancient and shrivelled prophylactic from within a pretty glass box, in anticipation of marital congress, would be enough to drive any woman into the arms of another man. Not least one who waltzes so prettily and has such glacial blue eyes *opens fan and fans self*. However Jude Law is also the most convincing emotionally, despite being a little dull he conveys how much he cares for Anna beneath his stolid exterior and I felt the most sympathy with him by the end of the story. Keira is a solid casting decision as Anna, she convinces as a devoted mother at the start of the film and does 'damaged morphine addict' very well. Also she does look spectacular in a period frock. Speaking of which the costumes, designed by Jacqueline Durran, are beautiful and are almost worth the ticket price alone. They contribute greatly to the beautiful look of this film. It reminded me of Sofia Coppolla's Marie Antoinette in that it is an utterly seductive confection but presents a society at the peak of their power and wealth and one is all too aware that the revolutionaries are lurking at the fringes of the scene.It didn't blow me away to the extent that Atonement did but I greatly enjoyed Wright's latest film. The cast is also splendid, a who's who of British costume drama talent including Ruth Wilson of Jane Eyre fame, Michelle Dockery AKA Lady Mary of Downton, Holliday Grainger as seen in the Borgias, as well as Domhnall Gleeson who I previously knew only as Bill Weasley in Harry Potter but who does sterling work as conflicted Konstantin. Look out especially for the beautiful mowing sequence where he wields a scythe with as much finesse as I've ever seen on the big screen and then manages to look extra decorative atop a haystack. Well worth a look if you're a period drama or Joe Wright fan.",Anna Karenina
224,aleksandra_04091981-230-467176,«Mysterious» Slavic soul review,9,13 March 2013,"Hello everybody, I am from Ukraine and, of course, I've seen the grand old Russian book-to-film adaptation and have read the novel. What I really want to say: Joe Wright's «Anna Karenina» doesn't require any credits because of ethnic differences etc etc - this is an artwork and it's worth watching.I really appreciate Jude Law's acting - nothing has reminded me about young, strong, handsome sex symbol, there was only Karenin - a mature emotionless man, pathetic in his gentleness. I believe his efforts deserve an award.And a few words about Keira Knightley - yes, definitely she looks different than women in Leo Tolstoy's times, when ""You have such a fat sugar white hand or a neck"" was the greatest compliment every lady dreamed about, but the way she played, or better to say, the way she lived this role, was pure Anna - those who have read the book will understand, what I mean.I don't like long reviews, so I finished, enjoy the movie!",Anna Karenina
225,rhymerink-257-835194,Unique cinematography,9,5 January 2013,"Dance. Drama. Romance. Passion. Tragedy. But no happiness. I had not read the book, but since Tom Stoppard did the screenplay I trusted his adaptation. Even though it is set in late 19th Century Russia, this is a timeless story. Are we not all looking for true love and happiness? What we do seems to be the folly of life that does often lead to tragedy. By using modern CGI this film does show how even today people search and search for someone or some thing that will bring happiness and joy. The recurring scene is the stage where the characters act out their lives. But sometimes we find that joy not by acting out as in a performance. The film has two characters who manage to find themselves and find love in a simple way. In the film, the attraction for many is in the glamour of performance whether it is on stage or at the horse races. All the actors portray a society in a different time and place. But their roles are still being played out in real lives today in places all over the world.",Anna Karenina
226,angela_kay_fitzgerald78,This had so much potential but failed horribly.,5,14 July 2013,This was a very odd movie. It's not one I'd recommend to the vast majority of people but it did have several redeemable factors. It was visually stunning. The scenes and costumes were breathtaking. The cinematography was pure art. I loved the unique way it was shot and edited. The scene changes were fun and unlike anything I can remember seeing in another film. The acting was emotional and seemed heartfelt. Now for the bad stuff. The plot and the way the story was laid out for the audience were both CRAP. It was hard to follow at times and I quickly became uninterested in the characters and their plight. I was not at all upset by the title character's death. In fact I would have welcomed it much sooner.,Anna Karenina
227,cathy-wright-330-456631,Got boring,6,22 February 2013,"I loved this book and have seen other filmed versions of the story. All had strengths and weaknesses. This one began as a visual feast, and I did not mind that it was not historically accurate in terms of costumes and mannerisms. Anna and her set lived their lives on the stage of society, and Wright's theatrical backdrop worked for me.But then, halfway through the movie, I got bored. My attention wandered, I started thinking about whether the weather was good enough to take the dog for a walk. Somewhere around the middle of the film, after Anna had her illicit lovechild, I stopped caring about her and Vronsky. Both got tiresome in their selfishness and petulance. Even good choices have costs. But Anna and Vronsky wanted everything for free. Instead of feeling like Anna's eventual death was a tragedy, I was glad as a viewer to be put out of the misery of watching her feel sorry for herself. To me, the Vronsky/Anna affair seemed more like a self-indulgent, adolescent romance than a passionate affair between two deeply feeling but essentially flawed adults.When other characters came on the scene, my attention perked up again. I was especially impressed by the work of Law as the emotionally crippled Karenin, Gleeson and Vikander as the sweetly loving Levin and Kitty, and Macfadyen as Stiva, the bounder with a heart. All of them, despite their flaws, had the capacity to consider others than themselves.",Anna Karenina
228,ciarano177,A film which presents the complex and intricate life of Imperial Russia,7,3 July 2014,"This modern take on Tolstoy's story of deceit, love and order in my opinion, presents a perfect view of Tolstoy's Imperial Russia during the late 19th century, its a nation ruled by paradoxes. The film displays the rigid and extensive class structure which was rampant through Russian society. I found this was is honed in when Anna Kareina leaves the train carriage filled with finery , the carriage itself being the symbol of affluence and influence. Her exit from this carriage which is a symbol of the small bubble which she presides in and allows her confront the larger world filled with poverty, this transition from from world to the next is shown with the railway worker who is blackened with soot moments before his untimely demise. The class structure is emphasized with the fluid scenery change, where it displays how the elite in society and the poorest of the poor are constantly bumping into each other yet they are divided by an invisible barrier. The story is based in a time where customs and traditional beliefs shaped the lives of everyone in Russia. For me the ballroom scene where court politics is at play display the fact that you are dancing with a partner who is a betrothed to another could result in frivolous rumors spreading like a wildfire can change one's standing in life. These are among the many reasons why i have found this film to be a success in is own right, the complexity of Russian Society during a tumultuous period of reforming and inter class conflict which is fueled by anger and hatred of the concept of privilege and the exuberant wealth of the few. I found the train to be a symbol of the route which will end with the downfall of Anna and Russia itself in the hands of the Bolsheviks in 1917-1918. This is a good film and i deserves a 7/10 in my honest and humble opinion.",Anna Karenina
229,sviola16,I absolutely loved it!,10,7 November 2013,"I was already in love with this story after reading it and was more than excited to see the movie. Anna Karenina, married to Alexey Karenin, travels to Moscow to persuade her brother's wife to forgive him for cheating on her. There, she meets the handsome Count Vronsky. Flattered by her, Vronsky tries to win her heart. She rejects him at first but as he constantly makes efforts in persuading her to be with him, things start to change. I was a little nervous about watching this version because it got so many bad reviews. After seeing it, I learned that I cannot trust reviews until I watch the movie. I fell in love with this movie! It blew my breath away! I was falling for Count Vronsky along with Anna. I don't think there could have been a more perfect cast. I didn't expect Kick-Ass's Aaron Johnson to do a remarkable job. He brought Vronsky to life with his use of effective dialog. I had always loved Keira Knightley and she is perfect for roles like this one; not to mention she's flawless. I was also impressed with the setting of this movie. It is portrayed as a play and a stage is used. This was a creative way to demonstrate this classic love story. I enjoyed every minute. It was entertaining and passionate and is now one of my favorite movies. It also serves as a great way to alert us, women, how much better our social status is today. ****SPOILER ALERT**** I will say that the only thing that disappointed me was Vronsky's reaction to Anna's death. In the novel, Tolstoy tells us that he goes to war because life was nothing to him anymore. I would have really liked to see this portrayed into the film.",Anna Karenina
230,quique_o_san,A different point of view,7,5 March 2013,"The visuals are stunning and the production design beautiful, but I agree with some people that it could be better, however, the first part of the film reminds me a lot of the russians montage, which Russia is very famous among filmmakers. It reminds me ""The Russian Ark"" and a style very defined and original. Yes it is a bit heavy to watch, but, in my opinion, it is very brave of a filmmaker to make something like this. The cinematography was amazing and the emotions that the sound mixing makes is great, but the acting could be better.Kiera looks like she wanted to pose every single frame she appeared and sometimes she had that hideous duck-face that every one hates, the films decays in the last hour, but I think that the pre production was arduous and the making very hard and I congratulate the braveness of Joe Wright and Seamus McGarvey",Anna Karenina
231,ti-swan,One Russian's take on the film,1,12 September 2012,"So, it is out – the film that so far has divided the opinions of the critics and audiences alike. A lot has been said about its theatrics and casting, visual effects and costumes. The trailer alone made me go to see it the first day it was released in London. Despite the misgivings about the casting of the main characters, I was hoping that the opulence of the setting, decorations and costumes would be just enough to make it enjoyable and compensate for any acting mishaps. The film focuses is on the key relationships in the novel taking the bare carcass of the storyline. The result is a mechanical sequence of events, devoid of any depth and humanity and almost clinically cold. Many nuances of the relationships are not explained at all and, had I not read the book many times over, these would have been lost on me. All of the socio-political and ideological issues affecting Russia in the late 19th century, as well as the questions of humanity, faith, religion and the meaning of life, are largely left out. Not only this accentuates the oddly flat quality of the scenario but also, owing to the lack of context, makes certain scenes (e.g. Levin in the country) look oddly standalone. As to the casting... Keira Knightley can be a delight to watch in the right context, i.e. when she can get away with being herself on screen (e.g. ""Bend it like Beckham"" and ""Love actually""). However in the costume/period dramas she makes no allowances for the differences in social behaviours and mannerisms and ends up looking like a flirtatious modern girl at a fancy dress party. In the book Karenina's character is a sophisticated, mature, confident and sensuous woman of high society and rank but also a deeply kind, humane and down to earth person. It is the latter qualities that endear her so much to the fellow book characters and readers alike from the beginning and help us feel the tragedy of her situation so keenly later. Knightley's Karenina is an all-too-young, flighty coquette with no obvious emotional maturity and little sense of decorum gradually developing hysteria which left me torn between incredulity and laughter. I wouldn't normally comment on the physical appearance which should be incidental to a true acting talent but modest chest and bony back sticking out of the impossibly low-cut dress (for the 19th century) add little to the believability of the character. Vronsky, with those blue eyes, blond locks, stiff movements and bland facial expressions reminds more of a china doll than a dark, handsome, charming and intense character that Karenina falls for. Would she fall for this version of Vronsky? Doubt it and neither did I. As for the rest of the cast, the only characters that look vaguely believable (and that taken in the context of the rest of the cast) are those of Kitty and Dolly. Ironically Kitty becomes more so towards the end of the film, when Dolly loses it entirely owing to the dialogue with Karenina at the tea room.Lastly I would like to touch upon a few details of costumes and styling which I find worth of note. I wish the costume designer incorporated the Russian fashions of the 19th century more faithfully. The façons presented with the backs cut out almost to the waist did not become fashionable (in fact, socially acceptable) until the 20th century. During the time portrayed in the film/novel they would have been scandalous. Lavish jewellery was, indeed, in vogue (although it is the understated elegance of choice so meticulously highlighted in the book that would have been true to Karenina's character). What Karenina wears in this film is unmistakably Chanel 21st century and bears no resemblance to the style or make of the time. I guess one comes to expect at least some product placements as part of the modern film industry and, in the absence of cars/phones/laptops etc in this film, one had to make the best out of what was available. Add to this aristocrats dressed like peasants (Karening in the ice-skating scene), rich landowner styled like a monk (Levin's hair throughout the film) then same landowner donned in a top hat not worn by the people from his ""soslovie"" (social stratum), Betsy and her jaundice coloured dress, Karenina at the theatre in what looks like a wedding dress and ermine stole, Karenin wearing his wedding band on the left hand (instead of the customary right in Russia), Karenina wearing multiple rings (Chanel-style, naturally) on both hands, - was someone confused as to the custom and decided to tick both boxes, just in case??! Classical waltz transformed into anything but, with peculiar hand movements that one critic described as ""beguiling"" but which looked suspiciously like mutual slapping of pesky insects and afforded a great deal more of physical intimacy in public than what was socially acceptable. Russian folk songs sang with strong foreign accent. At least no one in the film tried speaking with the Russian accent and for these small things, Lord, one should be grateful!Overall, I wish I could call the film a drama or, at least, a parody on the 19th century Russian society but, given its omissions and disregard of the cultural or social realities, it is not. For all its pomp and pretentiousness, the film fails to make a single character or scene fully believable, forget about moving or meaningful, and the final result appears to be nothing but a parody on the original effort. Some critics called this film as ""breathtaking"". I agree, it is breathtaking, - breathtakingly awful, that is.",Anna Karenina
232,phil-cree,Irritating Format and Serious Miscasting,6,17 September 2012,"If your prime reaction to a film is one of disappointment there are usually some good reasons. My principal response to this version of a great and well-known story is one of irritation. The overblown theatrical format of the film gets in the way of character and dramatic development, to the point where you're aware of a director proclaiming ""aren't we clever with the way we're staging this?"" instead of admiring the straightforward and competent telling of a story. I'm not saying all films have to be constructed in a conventional manner, but when the form overtakes the substance something has gone wrong.Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Count Vronsky is a piece of serious miscasting. Instead of looking like a great lover and sure temptation for wavering Anna,he looks like some feeble dandy with his foppish shock of dyed curly blonde hair which makes him look quite ridiculous. How on earth Anna could fall for such a creepy-looking guy is beyond most viewers I would submit.Keira Knightley does the best she can, despite looking most of the time like she's attending a fashion shoot. The character of Anna requires portrayal of a tragic life which she doesn't quite achieve. However, the whole film fails to convey the grandeur of Tolstoy's vision, so she's let off the hook by the film's general levity and lack of substance.",Anna Karenina
233,maeporter78,loved,10,23 September 2012,"I just finished reading the book and just saw the movie well on a trip, and really am happy i got to see it. I enjoyed how it was filmed and how each scene. when ever i see a book to film i always remind myself they have to change and or leave parts of the story out or add something. I look at this version with a more visual light then dialog. The fact that its set as a play was wonderful as i feel sometime now a days there are few opportunity's to get to an actual play. The cast i thought was great and fit what i had in my mind. The book to me is like 3 books in one and this movie focused on the love aspect with glimpses of the other aspects of the book.I'm an artist and seeing it i felt like i could get so much of the story from one shot or expressions on one of the characters face. looking at a picture you can never fully know the story behind it, even when you think you do.",Anna Karenina
234,adrianhoward1959,"Not sure Tolstoy would approve, we certainly didn't",4,3 October 2012,"It is hard to know where to begin with this film. On the one hand it cannot be denied that it is a sumptuous visual feast. And as any good chef will tell you, presentation counts for a lot, but once you put it in your mouth your eyes cannot help you anymore. And that is where the film goes wrong.Poor casting of both Anna and her lover, coupled with any lack of empathy for Jude Law as the husband, Matthew MacFadden as the deceitful whoring brother, Kelly MacDonald as the simpering sister-in-law and Ron Weasley's eldest brother as someone's brother who doesn't have the courage necessary to woo the girl he loves, makes it hard to get involved.The pretentious way in which the Director wanted this to be a film and a play was distracting and frankly left this viewer and his wife confused. You know that when you are wondering how much the blue wallpaper cost you have lost the plot.Being clever because you can is actually not being clever. Every film, book, play, TV show has to have a story that grips the reader/viewer so that you hunger for what comes next, not simply wonder if you will be more, or less bored / confused / disappointed.

In one of the scenes her manicure might be done better, or when she speaks I got impression that I am watching Aline... her saliva was catching my eyes.Scenes with the train. Really a toy?

Taking liberties with a great classic for the sake of making it film-worthy is one thing, but this confused and confusing attempt wound up less than effective and an interminable bore to boot. The history is muddled, the opulent costumes are not authentically of any period, let alone Russia of the time, and the scenery and stage sets add nothing but artifice to the overall effect. I won't attempt the wooden acting, or maybe that's the miserable direction, but the fictional yet palpable character of Anna Karenina has been wholly lost to some unrecognizable whim.",Anna Karenina

Matthew MacFadyen was ridiculously frivolous and poor Mr. Gleeson was entirely out of place, out of his element and had less sex appeal than a rodent. Insufficient development of Anna's marriage. She just cried throughout. Using a stage as a prop was also ridiculous! Really? A stage? How boring. I nodded half way through and only stayed til the end out of stubborness. What a disappointment.

238,media_comments,"How I Felt During and After ""Anna Karenina""",2,5 December 2012,"Closed in and Claustrophobic: I felt I could breathe only when the scenes escaped outside of the theater stage and onto the snow covered train depot or the green fields where Levin was sowing grass, or where love was a lazy-day picnic on the greenest of grasses, but only briefly and only disappointingly, after again finding myself cramped and stifled in a hot sweltering and old 19th century theater. The ball room scene was excruciating. The dances and dancers themselves reminded me of a mix of street dance, country and western, and some invented Tim Burtonesque ""Danse Macabre"" for the purposes of being unique, strange, and possibly ""histrionic"". The moves were stiff and unflattering and I was embarrassed to watch Anna and Vronsky clumsily make there way through the physical distortions that made their clothes appear ill-fitting and as though they both had two left feet. I could not feel the same passionate love between Anna and Vronsky in this movie adaptation as I'd previously felt in reading the novel. The emphasis on cinematic style and surrealism kept interrupting my wish to re-live and enjoy the story. Further, contradictory to the memories of my mind's eye of the handsome and manly Vronsky in the novel, I came to see him in the movie as bit effeminate-looking, weak, and depicted as a vulnerable little mommy's boy. I paid my ticket expectant and hopeful but at the end and as I exited the theater I found myself confused, disappointed, and ripped-off. Anna Karenina will always be one of the greatest experiences in literature I've had the pleasure of. But next time, as surely there will be yet a ""next time"", I'll simply pass on the movie. I simply cannot bear the risk of seeing Vronsky look like that again.",Anna Karenina
239,pisarenkov,The best Anna Karenina I have seen,10,16 December 2012,"First. What is a definition of the word ""critical art review""? Review is imposition of individual opinion through the press. During my long life (I am 72) I have seen many performances on the stage and movies ""Anna Karenina."" This film is the best. It has everything that should be in the movie: fantasy, entertainment, teaching, and of course the classic love story. For me, personally, it is not always important ""WHAT ABOUT"", it is also important to me ""HOW IT DONE."" From my point of view, movie is entertainment. Of course those critics who finds fault with hairstyles or jewelry, they know better what they want from the movies. They always want to hear a Russian accent and see plausible buttons on the dress. But this is not a police report, this is feature film. Visual aspects are amazingly talented. Acting work- to the point of perfection. First time in my life I saw real Karenin, not half-dead old man, but a loving decent husband. Keira Knightley is impeccable as Anna. Сrowd scenes are tasteful. Music is touching and talented. Tolstoy's novel is very hard to adapt for a screen, it even difficult to read, and the director was able to convey the main thing in this beautiful and romantic movie. I agree with Berthold Brecht who said: ""When you entertain -teach, and when you teach- entertain""."" There is no doubt that this film is not for everyone, and those who like ""Scream 2"" or "" Spiderman"", they do not have to watch this movie. All critical reviews are long and tedious, but the film is short, with exciting feelings and has a good taste. There is only one measure of art: talented or not talented. The rest is a matter of taste. But there is no accounting for tastes.This film is talented in every way.",Anna Karenina
240,brimallar,Visually pretty nice... otherwise....,5,23 December 2012,"I don't regret going to see this movie. And I won't touch on some of the other parts regarding authenticity of Russia or strict adherence to the book that others do as they have been covered well already. First off though, the ""theater"" aspect of the movie was simply distracting. It can--and has-- been used well in other movies, but in this one, it simply feels like they adopted this tactic to save on budget from traveling to Russia, or even filming in Canada and creating sets. Budget that could have been saved on say, casting (more on that later). This was unfortunate. I get the idea behind it, but I feel it limited the film in a big way. Visually, the movie isn't true at all to many aspects on 1870s Russia... one of the reasons I went to see the film is to view beautiful scenes of Russia (or a close proximity), not realizing that a large part of it was formatted in this theater way. Once in a while, outside of the ""theater"" setting, it worked wonderfully. Otherwise, it took away from what could have made this movie a visual feast. Besides the inauthenticity, it certainly is a gorgeous movie to watch. In fact, most of the stars I gave this movie are based on how 'pretty' everything looks--the costumes, people, and scenery. So, it is worth a look (maybe just as a rental) for the visual aspect, however inauthentic. The most unfortunate part of any book turned into movie is that the motivations behind characters actions are left out, while only the main actions are included. This movie not only has that fault, but emphasizes it more than most book turned movies. As a result, none of the themes, or even true characters, are captured. This seems to be a result of casting, mostly. Jude Law is excellent as Karenin, although he comes across as far too much of a doormat. Slightly less doormat-ey would have made his character PERFECT. The dude who played Levin was fine, except he lacked the emotional complexity later on in the film to give the scenes his character was going through any meaning without a viewer knowing the backstory. Against public opinion (maybe this is simply my taste), I found the actor of Vronsky to appear to be a sensual young man.... one that could believably seduce Anna. He appeared to be much more carefree than her husband--not caring that he appeared desperate in his attempts to gain her--which to me, would validate why he was especially appealing to Anna. A virile young man in contrast to her stark and boring husband who does not seek love. The casting of Keira Knightley was simply not okay. It isn't that she doesn't act well in other films, but she wasn't appropriate for this role at all. In the end, one is left to think that she is simply an impetuous, selfish person... which is NOT Anna Karenina. Sure, aspects of selfishness should appear, but not to the extent they did. In the later part of the movie, her character comes across as an unmedicated manic depressive with no soul. She has tears in her eyes for most of the movie--not the Anna that Tolstoy depicts as a woman who seeks to shirk what society thinks of her. For anyone who hasn't read the book, I feel this movie would make almost ALL the main characters holy unlikable--Anna is a selfish brat, Karenin is a doormat, Vronsky is a superficial soul-less person, and Levin is entirely unreadable. None of the motivations regarding why the characters act as they do are even remotely revealed. For people who have read the book, I think the focus will be on how distracting the ""theater"" setting is, as well as how some of the characters are misportrayed. Again, worth seeing just for the fun of the visual... but if the visual aspect isn't what you're after, skip it.",Anna Karenina
241,mycoolnickn,Snoozer,4,3 January 2013,"Leo Tolstoy's famous novel about high society in Imperial Russia was recreated for the big screen early November of this year. Directer Joe Wright, along with screen adapter Tom Stoppard, took a bold risk in making the new film version appear to be set on a stage with props, sets, and intricate backstage apparatuses. Although original and creative, the idea was not executed well at all; the film lost a sense of seriousness as the props and sets appeared to be cheap and fake. One of cinema's greatest aspects, its ability to encompass the best scenery and sets available, was nowhere to be found in Karenina, leaving viewers disappointed and thoroughly bored.Clearly a mistake was made by a member of the production team for this movie: this film was accidentally put in movie theaters when really, it was meant for Broadway. With its heartfelt and twisted love-story, adventurous yet conniving heroine, and its screenplay already made for the stage, this ""film"" would be a Broadway hit in no time. However, in the theaters, this movie was a stinker. The stage aspects left viewers confused, the cheap props made everything look imitation, and the relentless onslaught of melodrama, without any song and dance to break it up, was torturous. If anywhere, Anna Karenina belongs on the stage, where its stage-like qualities and musical-like cast would be better suited.While watching Karenina, I first began to think I was at a play instead of film no less than two minutes into it. The screen lights up on an enormous red curtain which slowly rises, announcing the start of the movie. Original as it was, this simple, yet influential, touch set a precedent for several other offsetting ""Broadwayisms,"" that served only to detract from the main themes of the film. The curtain debacle was soon followed by the first change between scenes, where the camera followed the main character off the 'stage' into the most complex backstage area I'd ever seen. Ropes, pulleys, sandbags, and stagehands were found everywhere, and all of a sudden I had no idea what was going on. The camera turned a corner after the main character, and just like that we were outside, back in the snowy streets of Moscow. By the end of this scene change, not I only did I have no idea what was happening, I was dizzy, nauseated, and bored. This pause from the story was, although short, quite distracting, and as you could guess, became very annoying when repeated several more times. In lieu of beautiful scenes filled with Russian Turrets, exquisite ballrooms, and picturesque 19th-century Moscow, viewers got a dark backstage, cheap plastic snow, and a plain wooden room simply filled with different furniture to serve as three separate locations.Although it wasn't quite right for film, Anna Karenina isn't a total hopeless case. The movie includes several scenes highlighting a vast ensemble of Russian farmers and factory workers moving with almost robot-like precision. It wouldn't take a big stretch of the imagination to turn these scenes into well-choreographed dance routines, set to catchy songs emphasizing the monotony of a Russian worker. Furthermore, a heartfelt scene involving Mr. Karenina mourning over news that his wife has been cheating on him could be turned into a beautiful solo, amplifying the emotions of this seemingly cold man. With a good cast and a Russian-themed score, Karenina could be ready for the curtain to draw in just a few months! Although this film made a bold attempt and failed, it should certainly receive an A for effort. The director did something most directors of novels-turned-to-films didn't do: veered away from the direct plot of the book and tried something interesting. For this, Mr. Wright, I commend you, but I'd suggest giving Broadway a try.",Anna Karenina

With the smirks and feeble attempts at humor it couldn't be the right movie. No offense to Kevin Kline, but A Fish Called Wanda vibe isn't what I expected in this movie. It felt as if I was seeing a play on film without editing out the set changes.At Vronsky's first entrance (doing a good Gene Wilder impression) I'd had enough of this spoof.Maybe this movie is okay if you haven't read the book, but having read it & loved it, this film is a joke.",Anna Karenina

Was looking forward to watching an engrossing film of a good book but after the first 30 mins gave up trying to understand what the heck was going on. Only glad that I hadn't paid to watch it if I had I would have been strongly tempted to ask for my money back. It would appear that the producers think that the inclusion of Keira Knightly is enough to guarantee box office success how wrong can they be. Whoever came up with the format of this film needs their head examining it may appeal to the cinema snobs but as far as the general public is concerned it's a candidate for the raspberry award.,Anna Karenina
244,valentinakozinovic,Inappropriate and just wrong,1,17 January 2013,"I was very looking forward to this movie, although I was prepared for the probability that it will be difficult to transfer human emotion and social circumstances of the time which Lav Tolstoy so vividly described. But, the final result made me ask myself was this supposed to be a parody? Not one grain of the brilliants was transferred to the screen, the casting was wrong, especially for the two main characters. Keira Knightley is a wonderful creature, but she definitely does not represent sophistication of Tolstoy's character, and as for the role of Vronsky...once you see him appear, you will know why I believed it was a parody. The sad conclusion to my review is that much has changed from Tolstoy's time, and there are no more happy families,but event though we can't grasp the full concept of his Anna Karenina, the directors should have made an effort to present it for what it really is-a great human inner conflict and tragedy, and not a mindless adventure of a silly ""school girl-like"" character.",Anna Karenina

I had really been hoping that it might capture just the smallest part of the intricacy and depth that Tolstoy is known for. If it had, I would have been satisfied. However, the theatre-like setting, aside from being a very badly executed ""artistic"" gimmick, is extremely distracting. The movie simply glosses over most of the important details of the story: the characters are flat, the political and philosophical ideas basically nonexistent, and much of the historical context, save the costuming, was lost. The costuming was the most convincing part of the movie, but much more was needed to make this movie worthwhile.",Anna Karenina

At first glance you might be forgiven for thinking this film is going to be another esoteric and avant-guard comic masterpiece by Terry Gilliam; the clever continuous shots, the dreamy painted backdrops, its all there....but no, unfortunately no Gilliam, and no comedy involved. Leo Tolstoi would be spinning in his grave if he saw this film, I doubt whether anyone involved with the flick has ever read the book, or in fact read A BOOK! And what is with the English accents? I fear it takes more than a bit of Cyrillic graffiti on the scenery to set the scene as period Russia. We switched off just after half way through this nonsense, I suggest you don't even start.

I was so looking forward to watching it and have seen the other previous versions.I am now totally confused about the whole storyline and the male lead (Count Vronsky) was totally unconvincing as a romantic partner.After I watched the film, I read the review on how the director created the film using a stage setting---horses galloping across the stage was even worse. I was so confused as to the plot and could not follow what was going on and the ideas he was trying to create. Why didn't he follow the love story as created by Tolstoy?",Anna Karenina

The worst negative feeling about the movie is that the main actress cannot carry the emotional requirements of being Anna Karenina. It was not the precision of fitting anatomical movements that made the case of Anna Karenina worth recognizing, rather the lack of lust and calculation that would have championed Anna's true humanness. The movie degraded the essence of Tolstoy's great spirit with a worthless piece of cosmetic theater that is all the more ashamed to ever been made or seen.",Anna Karenina

The spelling out of love with Kitty and Levin, Anna's reaction to Vronsky falling off his horse, her later paranoia and Jude Law as Karenin was unexpectedly amazing. I think Joe Wright created a beautiful film, and my eyes greedily ate up everything he presented, including Aaron Taylor-Johnson who is beautifully moustached in this. Also, I wouldn't profess myself as a Keira Knightley fan (Pirates *shudder*), but when she's with Joe Wright, in her beautiful period costumes, I think she's spectacular.

What an awful interpretation of Tolstoy. I would say it looks like a cheap vaudeville rather than a portrayal of a complex character and a tragic love affair. Ms. Knightley's Anna comes out as a one dimensional spoiled socialite who carries no substance. That is not what the great Russian author had in mind when he created the character. I am not even going to begin to mention all the underlying political and philosophical issues that the book encompasses that the movie failed to include. Suffice it to say that were the director trying to create Madam Bovary, he would have succeeded but with Anna Karenina, he falls quite short. I am sorry for my two hours wasted on this flop of a movie.",Anna Karenina

I kept waiting for the cast to break out into a production number. When I saw the clerks stamping papers in unison, I thought I was watching a Mel Brooks production. Seriously? This is as bad as it gets in Hollywood. When I think of all the starving actors that could have been fed with the money they spent on this flop, I cringe. And Keira Knightly is on the top of that list! (Somebody please take her to lunch.)I have enjoyed every production of Anna Karenina from the silent version to Masterpiece Theater. So when I saw the trailer for this production I was champing at the bit. Fortunately,in retrospect, I missed a chance to see it in the theater and resolved to wait for the DVD release. It took me a few minutes to figure out the quirky theatrical staging and kept waiting for the real story to begin. It soon became obvious that this was some kind of avant garde cinema experiment going horribly awry and I reached for the stop button.

252,aalbertocastro,The film Anna Karenina is the story of a crazy love between Anna Karenina and the Count Vrosky based on the novel written by Leo Tolstoi.,10,15 July 2013,"Anna Karenina: Tragedy of a Crazy LoveAntonio Alberto CastroSao Paulo, BrazilThe most recent version of the film Anna Karenina, which has been shown in the cinemas of Sao Paulo City, Brazil, was a production from the year 2012 and the story is based on the novel of the same name by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. This is an incredible story of a love affair that happened in 1874 after a journey was made by Anna Karenina (Keira Knightly), wife of the minister of the Imperial Russian government Alexey Karenin (Jude Law) from Saint Petersburg to Moscow to mitigate the suffering of her sister-in-law, who was experiencing difficulties in her relationship with her husband. There she was introduced to the young official of the Russian Imperial Army, the Count Vronsky, who was impressed with her beauty and began to court Anna Karenina. At first Vronsky was rejected in his attempt to get close to Anna, but on his insistence she gave way without any resistance because she had fall deeply in love with him.After the excited feelings calmed down between her sister-in-law and her brother, she decided to return to Petersburg where she lived with her son and her husband Karenin, but Vronsky decided to go to Petersburg too. There at the high society events they met very often and went to the same places such as the horse races, at the opera, at the balls and the parties frequented by the Russian aristocrats. The indiscretion of the relationship between Anna Karenina and Vronsky began to attract the attention of their friends and their husband's, which served as the pretext for Karenin to ask for a divorce and to hinder her from seeing their son. Anna was profoundly affected with the adoption of these drastic measures and began to suffer and at the same time to refuse pursue her relationship with Vronsky. One night pressed by Karenin about her love affair she answered with the arguments she was tired and the only thing she wanted was to sleep. The contradictions of Anna Karenina became more and more evident because at the same time she considered her husband to be a good man and did not want to be separated from her son, but on the other hand she did not want to think about the possibility of abandoning her beloved Vronsky. But finally Vronsky and Anna Karenina decided to have a baby and to go to live away from Petersburg. In the period of her pregnancy Anna insisted that Karenin accept her new baby, but he definitely rejected that proposal. Involved in a wave of troubles Anna began to ingest morphine and as result of that terrible crisis she lost her second baby. After these disagreeable events Vronsky decided to return back to Moscow to get married to a woman, who was suggested by his mother. The moral aspects of the film were very clear when during the discussions amongst the female friends of Anna some of them said that she ""broke the rules"", ""she broke the law"", which reflected the opinion of the author of the novel. In comparison with the version of Anna Karenina of the year 1948 in which the principal roles were played Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson, the version of 2012 is much more complex. Differing from the film of 1948 the last one being in color. The sound-track features traditional Russian themes creating an Russian atmosphere but in as much an artificial and theatrical way. The color is vague, which helped to create an ambiance intensively dramatic and ambiguous. That last version of Anna Karenina directed by Joe Wright added an episode, which established a parallel between a marriage in a family of the Russian aristocracy and a family of middle-class, whose head of the family got married to an ordinary young woman. He worked together with his peasants cutting the hay. Here, once more, Leon Tolstoy expressed his world view. The epilogue of this story is that a young and beautiful woman decided to throw herself under a train, which ran at high speed. This was the consequence of a crazy and irremediable passion from a first glance between Anna Karenina and the Count Vronsky. It is worthwhile to see these two versions and to make your own comparisons.",Anna Karenina

People - Stiva, Anna, Karenin, Dolly, Levin, everybody - they stepped in and I welcomed them with all my heart. Vronsky... well, I was embarrassed looking at the posters (blond? that young? that sweetie?), but I believed him at once at his ""Dance with me"". The dance - it tells everything.

None of them were particularly bad in their roles, though I did not think any of then were amazing (except for Jude Law who played Anna's husband very well).The place where this film really stood out was in its style. The costumes, the sets, the creativity, and how everything is set to a sort of abstract motion really set this film apart. My personal favourite scene was when Count Vronsky and Anna were dancing for the first time, the dance was beautiful, and the filming was expertly done.It all came at a price, the style took precedence over the substance, which is essential in a movie, the characters could have been developed more, the relationships and events could have been explored in more depth. Though the substance was not atrocious, it was nothing special.A 7 is the perfect number to summarize the quality of this film.

257,walker-sasha9,Show over Substance,5,25 September 2015,"The new version of Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina"" directed by the usually fantastic Joe Wright was purely show over substance. The film was mostly set on a stage or backstage, although this was a interesting concept it was executed in a messy delivery where the films set out was confusing. I personally love Wrights original style (showed in Atonement and Pride and Prejudice) where he showed a truthful and elegant story with his iconic single shot scenes, whilst in this film the new style didn't represent his work. The Costumes in this film were exquisite thanks to the work of costume designer Jacqueline Durran who did the costumes for Wrights other two films. The set designs were again incredible. These exterior may be stunning but Wright fell for a concept that many directors chose, to use pretty, odd things instead of meaningful story. The acting is excusable for the style is very hard to act with a non-naturalistic style and the all the actors have showed their talent in many others roles.I believe this film could have been another masterpiece for Wright for his traditional style would bring a certain feature that the other versions of the film didn't have. Although I have been complaining about the non-naturalistic style of the film I do applaud Wright for experimenting with something that pushes what is expected of him This film is enjoyable, but not incredible which non-naturalistic film brings. I hope that in the future that Joe Wright sticks to his unique style instead of using Show over Substance.",Anna Karenina

The entire plot is blown through in an incredible hurry. The theatrical production device is interesting, but in my opinion is not done convincingly, and the musical score does not fit the tone of the film. Very good performances by Jude Law, Domnhall Gleeson, and to a lesser extent Keira Knightley, but in my opinion Aaron Taylor Johnson and Matthew McFadyen are miscast.

The rest is over-dramatized, irritating, a poor watch. It's also very claustrophobic... I mean, this is set in Russia... yet there is a 'compressed' atmosphere in the movie, even in the train station where there is no sense of space... no air, which makes the viewer feel locked in a room, and worse, with a horrible movie to watch.

I don't understand why they have to present it in a theatrical (sort of) way, those behind the scenes things and backdrops was just weird. Maybe they wanted to be ironic about how the society worked around that era but how they'd done it was just silly. It was irritating! It almost made me abandon the movie. If they presented it in the normal narrative maybe then we could have been more attached to the characters.I'm not a supporter of adultery or plain cheating but I liked Vronsky and Anna together. Their love although impure on the eyes of everyone else's, was real. Real enough that they lost their sense of morality and everything else. It was an exhilarating kind of love that possessed the both of them. One of which they have not felt before, specially for Anna.Until it spiralled out of control. I both love and hate how it ended. There were options for Anna and Vronsky to be together however society made it hard for them to move on... and when society kinds of gangs up on you no matter how strong you are, somehow they get to you.Kiera Knightley always aces the crying part, she really makes you feel this wretched pain the character goes through (although empathy for the characters are hard to achieve when the movie makes us so detached from them).Anna's breakdown was in all ways, relatable. When you gained something by risking everything else, it makes you tighten your grip on that something you have left. And always, by doing so, we lose it.The last parts of the movie did not fail to show that. I also liked how the aftermath was presented. It wrapped up what has transpired rather peacefully. (although i would very much like to see Vronsky's perspective through the ending).The movie could've easily been great like the masterpiece of a book it's based from. But oh, well.

Anna Karenina is not by any means skinny and her character has a bit more substance in Tolstoy's masterpiece than what is portrayed by Keira. She was not flippant or frivolous by nature and found herself in a very difficult situation when dealing with her family breakdown. The set up of the movie is weird as well- for a person who has never read the book it would have been impossible to understand how the characters are related and what really happened, as the most important moments are omitted.

Doesn't make a top ten list for me but it was good enough to add to the keep pile and watch again at a later time. The time period and setting of the movie are okay. The accents don't really match up to what one would expect as a Russian period film. It you can over look that you can over looks and other minor details. Also if you like the cast it helps but it isn't what makes this movie entertaining. If you're thinking of renting or watching it I don't feel it'd be a waste of time to do so.

It reminds me of The Grand Budapest Hotel in that way, there's an awkwardly existential feeling. The romantic element pulls from period drama Anti-Hero/Heroine characters. The way they use the rafters in the theatre is very dynamic in an early scene. The sub-plot is engaging and diverting. Of course, Keira is a beautiful leading lady. The IMDb rating, in my opinion, does not reflect the quality of acting, and directing. I understand why some many not like it but the style, although not to everyone's taste is far from bad or basic. I thoroughly enjoyed the heightened passion throughout. It's one to watch but still, one like Marmite.",Anna Karenina

Melodramatic, soapy, cheesy, Disney-lie, saccharine, sentimental tosh. An exercise in excess. Knightley is miscast. She plays the same role she does in most of her films. She is out of place here. The film is somewhat of a reinterpretation of Anna Karenina in that Anna is shown to be a liberated, modern woman living in a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned society instead of showing her to be the hypocrite that she really is (even in the film).To avoid spoilers, I won't go into specifics, but let's say that her values at the start of the film were the same as everyone else's, she then broke the rules and the film makes her to be the victim of a repressive society. Anna just wants to live her life, live the life, have the cake, eat it, have everything she wants, society, husband, boyfriend, child, family name, money, dresses, balls, dances, waltzes, respect etc. Is that so wrong? What's wrong with Russians? Also casting Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Vronsky is some sort of joke. The only way I see him being in bed with Anna is in a threesome with her husband where he tries to get him to switch teams. The mustache, the hair, the mannerisms, did I say the mustache, really don't work.We are not given any reason why she would fall in love with him or be in love with him. We don't know why he loves her so much. It makes no sense. It's mutual, intense, Romeo-and-Juliet reciprocated love from the first sight between a married woman and a player.The music is also really annoying after a while.

To my surprised as the story unraveled, I did find it´s theatrical approach quite fitting to the theme of the movie and it was very interesting to see the scenarios change as the actores moved through the screen as if it was a play.As a first time watcher of this amazing and unsettling story, I can´t say the approach of the director made justice to the book because, as I said said, I haven´t had the chance to read the 800 pages long classic, but what I can say is that this movie isn´t for everyone. It takes patience and interest from the viewer, and in my opinion, if the viewer is committed to appreciate the beauty of this movie, it will definitely be worth the watch, and perhaps, the re-watch.To finalize, i did enjoy this movie very much, it think it was beautiful and the actores did an amazing job portraiting the caracteres.

It's mind blowing when there is a scene starting at the theatre (inside the film) and at some point the scene continues and the drama of the theatre play becomes the story of the film itself. There is, in the film this continuous merging and fusion between what you can see on the theatre stage (theatre in the cinema) and the stage of the film whcih was directed as a theatre piece.

269,danishwedding,"Engaging story, artfully created with fine acting!",9,5 January 2018,"This is the first review I have submitted for any movie, at any time. I am doing so because I was unusually pleased with this film. For the record, I am generally a very harsh critic. As an example, I just saw ""Darkest Hour"" on Churchill, in the theater, which Rotten Tomatoes gave 4 out of 5 starts (or tomatoes?) whereas I came out of that theater critiquing the music and sound track. Otherwise, good film.The Karenina film, for me, was seen on television and without any plan or knowledge of the film before hand. In short, I had heard the name but had no expectations. As a result, I was open to it.The costumes were fantastic, the angles, lighting and sound, as well. The unusual manner of filming was, as some reviewers called it ""artsy fartsy"" but accepting that it would be such early on, it did not distract me. Perhaps it even added just enough. Would I have been bored with out it? It is possible. Maybe it filled in some areas that would have left holes otherwise - I won't know.The acting was also good. Each role was well-defined, well-played, and there was no discomfort or obvious ""issue"" between actors. In other words, it flowed well and was believable. Yes, there was the contrived moment when Karenas lover lifted her in the air while dancing, and the choreography seemed to intentionally reflect what the director might have thought was a woman's orgasm, but that passed quickly and moved on. In general the emotions evoked seemed real, and yes, many issues were raised that left me wondering - not only about the history and how relations were at the time, but also how relations are now. To bring it forward, it was almost as if the old story revealed that co-dependence, as we might call it today; that inexplicable passion that binds people in ways that can be as destructive as they seem positive, can seem attractive, but in the end destroy us. It was passion that lead the main character to set aside her awareness and concern over morality. It was passion that lead her to mis-perceive the effect that her choices would likely have on her down the road, and which caused her to forget how much she loved her son. I am left wanting to see it again, or to read the book. So for me - it gets nine starts and recommendations that others see it.",Anna Karenina

The book kept me up until 1am for several nights until I finished the book. It was so good. It was encompassing and I was all in. The movie was a huge fail and the director clearly had such an ego he thought he could do better than Tolstoy. Shame.The format was f'g awful. (Pardon the language),Anna Karenina
271,jerdahber,Love hatred,3,10 September 2012,"First impression is that i was put out of my comfort zone. I am not particularly fond of love stories. However, I tend to enjoy romantic ones. Some people would say I like it cheesy, or dramatic. This film left me with a bitter taste. A strong taste that forces me to write something so that i can sleep more easily. It is not about the theatricality of the movie, after the first 10 minutes, I got caught into it. It is not about the costumes, nor the music which I found profoundly beautiful. It is not about Keira Knightley who is as lovely and pretty as she has ever been. Nor about Jude Law who is even better. Most actors and actresses are actually good (except maybe the boyish and hairless count). Some scenes are funny, others are hot. It is visually pleasant. It is definitely not about the story itself, god forbid me to say anything wrong about Tolstoi. I thought it could be then about my biased feeling about Love. But then I realized I nearly cried last week when I watched Garden State for the n-ieth time.Therefore, what is it about ? I did not like the movie. I did not even hate it. The thing is, I felt nothing. I actually hate not hating it. The only thing I ask about a love story in the end is to make me FEEL. But niet, nothing, Nada. I maybe felt empty. I do not like feeling empty. Once again, I use the word like or dislike. I probably wish i did not waste that time. Wasting time to see it but also to think about it after-wards. The worst part about this Love story is that I will remember the story and forget the Love.",Anna Karenina
