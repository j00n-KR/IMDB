0,TheLittleSongbird,Entertaining and inventive,8,3 September 2010,"I wasn't expecting What Women Want to be as fun as I found it. The premise I initially found rather daft, and some of the subplots are superfluous and drag the film down. However, What Women Want is a pleasant watch, as it has lovely cinematography and the soundtrack has a nice quality to it. The film is wittily written and sharply directed too, while the story is pretty interesting and unique on the whole, like Nick Marshall's gift of being able to hear women's thoughts. The two lead performances are excellent, Mel Gibson can be obnoxious like his character but he is also very charming, while Helen Hunt is great as his far-from-perfect love interest. All in all, entertaining and inventive. 8/10 Bethany Cox",What Women Want
1,SnoopyStyle,overacting Mel Gibson not funny,4,27 December 2013,"Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a womanizing ad executive specializing in T&A for men. He thinks he's on top of the world. His ex-wife is getting remarried, and he's expecting to be promoted. The problem is his boss Dan (Alan Alda) is losing accounts for women. So Dan hires outsider Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) as his superior. Meanwhile his daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) is staying with him for 2 weeks while her mother honeymoons. Then he accidentally electrocutes himself and hits his head in the bathroom. When he wakes up, he finds that he can read women's mind.Nancy Meyers may know the mind of a woman, but I don't know what she thinks Mel Gibson's character is doing. He is going crazy for no reason. First if she wants to have a men's man, why would she have him drink red wine, or watch men's gymnastics? If a straight man lands on men's gymnastics, he would switch channel as quickly as possible. And while it's great that he listens to ol' Blue Eyes, why is he dancing like Fred Astaire? And why does he go crazy hearing women's thoughts? He's completely overacting, and Nancy Meyers shouldn't encourage it. It is not funny. It's just stupid. He's acting like a BITCH....or MITCH.And he has to go to a shrink to realize that reading minds is a superpower. All of a sudden, he's an idiot and a schizo. If you can get pass this, Mel calms down and the movie improves. But then the final dialog is so clunky, that it made me wince. I understand what Meyers is trying to do by switching the gender roles. But a guy would never say that to a woman. So why should Helen Hunt say that to Mel Gibson?",What Women Want
2,Hitchcoc,A One Trick Pony,6,5 November 2001,"Others have grasped most of what I see as deficient in this film. It is so unmemorable. The gimmick, of course, is that the Mel Gibson character is suddenly saddled with the ""gift"" of knowing what women are thinking when he is on the scene. This is fun for a few minutes, but when it pushes two hours, it's time for more popcorn. One of the important premises of life is the mystery of not knowing what others think. I can't think that anything but sadness can come from such realizations, and they do in this film. Gibson does so much mugging for the camera and acts in such a foolish way that he becomes a buffoon. Of course, we know from his background that he has been ""submerged"" in women since he was a little boy, but has turned into the consummate jerk: successful and self-centered. When he uses his knowledge for his own gain, he becomes something of a frantic monster. His love interest and adversary is actually a good person who must play hard ball to survive. He is allowed to show a bit of compassion when he becomes interested in the young woman who he suspects is suicidal, but then goes back to being a silly, erratic, sniveling puppy. Of course, it all works out in the end and all is forgiven. So what?",What Women Want
3,Prismark10,Top Max,5,21 July 2018,"Before his well publicised meltdown in 2006, this was as good as it gets for Mel Gibson as an actor. A romantic lead, a little bit of crooning like ol blue eyes and a few dance steps like Fred Astaire witout resorting to any violence. It is such as shame the story wa so humdrum.Gibson is a womanising lothario, Nick Marshall. An arrogant advertising executive who has made it big, the underlings at the firm especially the females get short shrift. The ad agency wants to target women as they think it is losing ad business for the female market. Marshall's boss hires Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) who is brought in from the outside as Marshall's superior to specifically target the female ad market which causes Marshall some distress.After a mishap in the bathroom when Marshall electrocutes himself, he finds that he can read women's mind. At first he is dazed and confused but soon learns that he can use this skill for his own advantage. Both for professional and personal reasons. He steals Maguire's ideas and gets a major account but soon repents.This film could had been so much better. The gimmick feels stretched and the film's pacing drops in the middle. It is amiable enough but actually wastes its cast that includes Alan Alda, Marisa Tomei and Bette Midler.",What Women Want
4,classicsoncall,"""Turn me into me again!""",7,25 June 2021,"A clever concept, rife with possibilities is offered in this picture, and some of it works while some of it doesn't. Mel Gibson is somewhat off-putting at times with his over emoting and forced facial expressions, but Wow! His Fred Astaire act done to a Sinatra recording was sensational. I would never have thought he could pull off moves like that. That was probably the highlight of his performance in ""What Women Want"", otherwise he bumbles his way through the picture as a guy who can 'hear' women's thoughts. He uses his new found ability to outmaneuver the executive hired for a position that seemed to be rightfully his until the Sloane-Curtis advertising agency decided to take a new approach to attract a female audience. Helen Hunt as Darcy Maguire playing opposite Gibson's Nick Marshall seemed a mismatch at first but they got around to making things work by the picture's finale. The movie's most poignant moment though, occurred when Nick found a way to assuage his daughter's (Ashley Johnson) feelings after being jilted by her boyfriend for not putting out. He showed he could be sensitive and understanding while not being under the influence of the mind reading gimmick. Back in the day this would have been an excellent date movie, but that was before #Metoo. Today I'm not so sure it's what women would want.",What Women Want
5,jboothmillard,What Women Want,7,1 July 2005,"I remember seeing this once when I was younger, I knew there was a gender-reversed remake starring Taraji P. Henson called What Men Want, but I wanted to see the original again first, especially to improve my previous review and opinion, roduced and directed by Nancy Meyers (The Parent Trap, The Holiday, It's Complicated). Basically, in Chicago, Nick Marshall (Golden Globe nominated Mel Gibson) was raised by his Las Vegas showgirl mother, and as adult has become a chauvinistic advertising executive. He is skilled at selling products to men for advertising firm Sloane Curtis, and he is skilled at seducing women. Nick is expecting to get a promotion, but his manager Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda) instead hires Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) to broaden the firm's appeal to women. Meanwhile, Nick's former wife Gigi (Lauren Holly) is on her honeymoon with her new husband Ted (Robert Briscoe Evans), so his estranged fifteen-year-old daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) is staying with him. Alex is embarrassed by Nick and resents him being over-protective when he meets her eighteen-year-old boyfriend Cameron (Eric Balfour). Darcy tasks the staff, including Nick, to develop advertising ideas for a series of feminine products she gives out as samples for the staff at a meeting. While testing a few items at home, including waxing strips, stockings and lipstick, Nick falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer. He jumps out as the hairdryer falls into the war, shocking his foot and he is knocked unconscious. The next morning, Nick wakes up to discover he has a new gift: he can hear women's thoughts. He is overwhelmed by the various female voices in his head and initially wants it to stop, especially when he realises that most women, especially at work, dislike him. He attempts to reverse what has happened by shocking himself again, but it fails. Nick also tries to convince his friend and colleague Morgan Farwell (Mark Feuerstein) about his newfound power, but naturally he does not believe him. So, he decides to visit his former therapist, Dr. Perkins (Bette Midler), who eventually realises he can indeed hear what she is thinking. She encourages him to use his newfound ability to his advantage. Nick telepathically eavesdrops on Darcy's ideas for an advertising campaign and steals the idea as if it was his own. As they spend more time together working on advertising ideas, surprising Darcy as he repeats her thoughts to her, he also gradually becomes attracted to Darcy. Meanwhile, he has been flirting with coffee shop worker Lola (Marisa Tomei) for some, but she has never accepted a date, until he uses his telepathic ability. Nick and Lola finally go on a date, and sleep together, with Lola saying, ""it's like you could read my mind"" and calling him a ""sex god"". Later, on his way back home, Nick finds a distraught Lola who hasn't heard from him in a week. Lola accuses him of knowing what she wants because he is hiding the fact that he is gay. Knowing it is the only answer he can give that won't hurt her feelings, he goes along with this assumption, and they part ways. Alex resents her father for the years of neglect, but she is surprised by his change in attitude, as he can hear her thoughts. They start to bond, and he takes her shopping for a dress for the upcoming prom. After Nick telepathically finds out that Alex intends to have sex with Cameron the night of the prom, Nick tries to give her some advice. He tells her Cameron is not interested in her for who she is, just in having sex with her. Alex accuses Nick of trying to sabotage her night at the prom and being over-protective again, she rejects his advice. Nick and Darcy spend more time together in and out of work, and they are falling for each other. But after stealing Darcy's idea for a new Nike ad campaign aimed at women, Nick has regrets. He feels guilty for his actions, as it leads to Darcy being fired by Dan. Nick persuades Dan that the ideas were actually Darcy's, eventually this is successful. Overtime, Nick uses his ability to successfully repair his relationships with female acquaintances, especially the women at work. Nick loses his gift during a severe thunder and lightning storm while following company secretary, Erin (Judy Greer), who has been having thoughts of suicide. Nick talks to her to offer her a position she has previously been turned down for and feeling reassured she accepts. Cameron dumps Alex at the prom for refusing to have sex with him, Nick turns up and finds her distraught, he consoles her and helps to cement their newly repaired relationship. Nick visits Darcy and explains that he had been stealing her ideas. As his boss, Darcy fires him there and then, but finds it in her heart to forgive him, and they share a kiss. Also starring Delta Burke as Eve, Valerie Perrine as Margo, Sarah Paulson as Annie, House's Lisa Edelstein as Dina, Ana Gasteyer as Sue Cranston, Loretta Devine as Flo the Doorwoman and Logan Lerman as Young Nick Marshall. Gibson is really likeable, going from cocky and obnoxious to charming and a good listener (literally), Hunt is good as his rival turned love interest, their chemistry is terrific. The idea of a man hearing what women want is cleverly inventive, it has the obviously funny inner thoughts of the women, and Gibson reacting and acting on them with amusing results, other highlights include Gibson's Sean Connery impression and his solo dancing and singing to Frank Sinatra's ""I Won't Dance"", all in all, it is a satisfying and enjoyable romantic fantasy comedy. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",What Women Want
6,moonspinner55,"Trendy, ultra-slick commercial throwaway...",4,1 July 2006,"21st century variant on the old battle-of-the-sexes theme, naturally spiked with an extraordinary gimmick to put the material over with today's seen-it-all audiences. Mel Gibson plays a womanizing ad-exec in Chicago who--through electrocution!--is suddenly able to read the minds of all females. At first, he uses this newfound gift for personal gain, but soon finds himself becoming a more caring and sensitive man who learns to listen before he speaks. Fast-paced but dim, fatuous comic fantasy of male and female relations in modern times. It purports to be speaking the Truth about the sexes, but in the interim tosses off a lot of snappy lines and superficial answers. Most of the female performers are directed to be hammy and irritating, and nearly everyone in the cast overacts. Gibson manages to retain his appeal, though even he can't save the film from a sour finish. ** from ****",What Women Want
7,Quinoa1984,"Off and on, witty",7,18 December 2000,"I thought that What Women Want ages an age old question for chicks: what would Mel Gibson be like if he were a woman?  Well, I feel that in this film, where he will and does try on pantyhose and leg wax, he still rules over all.  Anyway, this is a pretty witty romantic comedy that has a almost original concept- what would a man do if he could hear (and possibly listen) to what women think.  Many scenes in this film are amusing to the least and it is smart about it's suject matter, only if it didnt have some unneeded dramatic scenes, overused standards (songs) and a suicidal character, this film would be better than good.  Oh well.  Gibson and company (including Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei, Alan Alda and Delta Burke to name a few) do what they can to they're max and they succeed, sometimes.  B",What Women Want
8,wes-connors,Mel Gibson Gets in Touch with His Feminine Side,6,25 April 2010,"After a blow-drier lands in his bathtub, promiscuous ""man's man"" executive Mel Gibson (as Nick Marshall) develops the power to read women's minds. A chauvinist by nature, Mr. Gibson decides to use his power to steal business ideas from successful competing female executive Helen Hunt (as Darcy Maguire). You don't have to be Freud to figure out what happens to Gibson and Ms. Hunt.Though tame and predictable, ""What Women Want"" benefits from good production values and features a strong supporting cast, in showcase-written roles. Director Nancy Meyers and box office favorite Gibson handle several comic scenes amusingly well. There really isn't much revealed about women's secret thoughts. They want to look nice and have good sex, but seem more complicated.****** What Women Want (12/13/00) Nancy Meyers ~ Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, Ashley Johnson, Marisa Tomei",What Women Want
9,Coventry,Utopia...,5,2 May 2004,"Every once and a while there comes a movie of which you really regret the fact that it's premise is just fiction Life would so much easier if this was true. Dig this: Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and when he comes to his senses again, he can actually READ women's minds!! What a treat that must be! Last time I suffered slight electrocution I was shivering for 3 days and Gibson gets to understand women??? Anywayabout the film. It all may look fresh and light-headed but in fact it's pretty routine and annoyingly superficial! We learn that the stuff women think about is actually ordinary and rather obvious (they don't want to get hurt emotionally, they want to prove that there's more to them than just a pretty face etc etc) The screenplay contains a few major clichés, like tremendous emotional speeches and Gibson who automatically gets mistaken for a gay man. Or that dreadful moral about waiting for your `first time' till you're ready for it yourself?? Yuck! As far as I'm concerned, they could have done much better things with this basic idea. There are a few positive aspects to discover as well, of course. The acting for example. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt are a terrific on-screen couple and I really wish they had been given a better script to work with. Some good acting by familiar faces in smaller roles as well, such as Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, Marisa Tomei and even Bette Midler. `What Women Want' has got a high level of feel-good moments and feminisation message, but it's overall pretty neutral. Good, smooth soundtrack thoughLot's of Frank Sinatra oldies!I tend to know what women want as well: this kind of cinema. Watch it with your wife/girlfriend/mistress and you'll definitely get lucky tonight ;)",What Women Want
10,sunwarrior13,More Of A Romantic Comedy Than What Are Women Thinking,9,2 December 2011,"What Women Want is a romantic comedy that features. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt together with Marisa Tomei,Alan Alda,Lauren Holly,Ashley Johnson, and Bette Midler.The story is about a chauvinistic executive who gains the ability to hear what women are really thinking after an accident.It was was written by the following:Patrick Swidler,Josh Goldsmith,Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake; and it was directed by Nancy Meyers.The movie is about Nick Marshall, a Chicago advertising executive and alpha male, who grew up with his Las Vegas showgirl mother.He is a chauvinist. He is skilled at selling to men and seducing women, including local coffee attendant Lola. However, just as he thinks he's headed for a promotion, his manager, Dan, informs him that he is hiring the talents of Darcy McGuire instead, to broaden the firm's appeal to women.Also, his estranged 15-year-old daughter Alex is spending two weeks with him while his ex-wife Gigi goes on her honeymoon with her new husband. Alex is embarrassed by Nick, and resents his being protective when he meets her boyfriend.Needing to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy distributed at the day's staff meeting. However he slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, electrocuting himself. The next day, Nick wakes up able to understand his maid's thoughts as she cleans his apartment. As he walks through a park and encounters numerous women, he realizes that he can hear their thoughts, even those of a female poodle. This proves to be an epiphany for him when he hears the thoughts of his female co-workers (some of whom have slept with him and regretted it). When he goes to a previous therapist, Dr. Perkins (who also disliked him), she realizes his gift: ""If Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus, and you can speak Venutian, the world can be yours.""What Women Want has an very interesting plot.Unfortunately,it does not make full use of it in the majority of the film.It essentially turns into a romantic comedy that centered on the love relationship between Nick and Darcy.Too bad that the film does not fully explore what capacity of a man being able to hear what women are thinking.That is the only problem I have with the storyline.With regards to acting,obviously,Gibson was great in his role.Special mention also goes to Hunt,Alda and Tomei.It was rather unfortunate that the film does not center on Nick's ""special power"" but rather on his character development as a person,a father,an employee and his lovelife.The movie has a lot of promise with its interesting premise.Too bad that it falls into the trap of being an average romantic comedy that has a happy ending.What Women Want is a rather conventional, fluffy comedy-romance that doesn't make good use of its premise.",What Women Want

12,zardoz-13,Amusing fluff that gives Gibson a change of pace.,8,8 February 2008,"""Lethal Weapon"" superstar Mel Gibson shows his softer side in director Nancy Meyers' ""What Women Want,"" an entertaining but stereotypical battle of the sexes romantic comedy that co-stars Helen Hunt, Alan Alda, and Bette Midler. Cast as ace Chicago advertising executive Nick Marshall, Gibson plays the quintessential man's man: an unapologetic male chauvinist who believes that you can sell anything if bikini-clad babes bedeck it. Success thus far has proved Nick right, so he fully expects his chummy boss, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), to promote him as the agency's new creative director. Unfortunately, Wanamakers is in big trouble, and in an effort to save his ailing ad agency, Dan decides to target women rather than men. ""Girls born in the mid-1980s control our advertising dollars,"" Dan explains. ""It's a woman's world. You can get into their pants better than anyone I know, but getting into their psyche is something else."" That said, Wanamakers hires an outsider, Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), recently booted from a rival agency on the basis of sexual discrimination to fill the spot that Nick thought he had sown up.At their first meeting, Darcy gives everybody an array of feminine products: toenail polish, pantyhose, lipstick, mascara, a wonder bra, and leg wax. She asks them to concoct a campaign that will make these items irresistible to women. Nursing his bruised ego but willing to tough it out, Nick experiments with these wares to find an innovative advertising angle. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-wife Gigi (Lauren Holly) is getting remarried and dumps his 15-year old daughter, Alex (Ashley Johnson), on him while her new husband and she head off for their honeymoon. Nick polishes his toenails, applies mascara, leg wax, and cavorts in the bathroom with a hair dryer. Accidentally, during his fantasy role-playing, he falls into the bathtub and electrocutes himself.No, Nick doesn't wind up with a halo and a harp. Instead, he can hear the innermost thoughts of all the women, especially his prom-bound daughter. Initially, this drives Nick totally nuts. Eventually, he appeals to his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler) and proves to her that he can read her thoughts. ""If you know what women want,"" Bette's eyes bug out, ""you can rule!"" And rule Nick does. He uses his uncanny talent to read Darcy's thoughts and steal her ideas. Before long Dan believes that he has misjudged not only Nick but also Darcy. Nick's sudden sensitivity even astonishes Darcy, so that when Nike comes to court Wanamakers, the unscrupulous Nick uses Darcy's ideas to land the account.The premise of ""What Women Want"" is the stuff of classic screwball comedies. Of course, only in a movie could somebody survive electrocution and emerge as a mind reader. If you can dismiss this preposterous plot device, the subsequent comedy and romance that ensue should please both sexes. Predictably, Nick sees the error of his ways. As Mel's first romantic comedy since 1992's ""Forever Young,"" ""What Women Want"" qualifies as amusing fluff that gives Gibson a change of pace.",What Women Want
13,Calicodreamin,Charming,7,5 June 2021,"Mel Gibson charms in this romcom of sorts, it's the perfect role for him.

14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A romantic comedy that a guy can see too,7,1 February 2004,"This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds(possibly thousands) of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking. OK for a romantic comedy. 7/10",What Women Want
15,anaconda-40658,What Gibson Wants.,7,15 March 2016,"What Women Want (2000): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei, Bette Midler, Lauren Holly: Effective comedy about understanding genders. Mel Gibson stars as a creative executive. His mother was a showgirl so he has always been surrounded by women. He is demoted at work in favor of Helen Hunt who immediately sets upon advertizing for women. He arrives home to find his daughter and boyfriend huddled on the coach. He dances in a drunken stupor until he accidentally electrocutes himself in the bathtub. The suicidal aspect halts the humour but the biggest issue regards the unexplained mystery of the whole incident. Gibson does a wonderful job reacting to the voice thoughts of women and then using it not only to his advantage, but also to gain greater understanding. Hunt is not the typical romantic interest either. Supporting roles are cardboard including Marisa Tomei as an ex- girlfriend who must live with a lie. Bette Midler also appears although more would have been great. Lauren Holly was at her best in Dumb and Dumber, but here she is merely done in by a cardboard role. Directed by Nancy Meyers who made the miserable remake of The Parent Trap. Thankfully she doesn't stoop that low here. She has fun with the gender theme in this film. Strong theme regarding communication, which is the key in finding out what women want. Score: 7 / 10",What Women Want
16,Aaron1375,Mel Gibson in what amounts to a chick flick with a few laughs men can appreciate.,4,17 November 2011,"Saw this film in its entirety, but never during one viewing. Just goes on to long, but I have seen the basic premise and get the idea of what it is about and though not a scientist I am pretty sure one can not gain the ability to read the thoughts of only women through electrocution. This film is about an arrogant man who is able to find out how others feel about him after an incident as he finds he has the ability to read only female's minds. He learns that most have a low opinion of him, though I do believe in reality he would be catnip to the ladies and he would be the one they would fantasize about. He is also having to watch his teen daughter while trying to reclaim his old job by using his new found ability to make the new boss look bad. There are a few funny scenes here and there, but one has to wonder who made this film. I find it hard to believe a woman did as if she did, she apparently has no real clue as to what women want. I do not claim to be an expert, but from what I have read most of the time they are thinking about food and things of this nature, not how they hate men as they go on runs. This film was one of the last real hits for Mel Gibson other than the Passion which he did not star in. I really wish instead of this one he had done the fourth Mad Max film as it is sad that this is one of the last films he did that really garnered an audience.",What Women Want

20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Decent rom com,7,27 May 2011,"Mel Gibson back before all the trouble he has gotten himself into now a days, the in between days as I like to call them, he was voted as the sexiest man alive. Surprisingly he didn't do romantic comedies, mainly action or epic adventure films. He starred in What Women Want with Helen Hunt. This is also back when romantic comedies actually cared about their stories and the characters and were not just made for a cheap buck, so we have some actual depth to the story here. Typical with a lot of stories, what do women want? As a woman, I can give you an honest answer, I don't know and neither does any other woman. We all want different things and that's what this film is about, the man who thinks that he knows everything about women as most people know someone like that when you know the truth is that they're just clueless. We've had a lot of plots like this where a man has dressed, talked or acted like a woman to find out what we're thinking or why we do things the way we do them. What Women Want takes a different approach in making Mel Gibson actually hear the women's thoughts.Nick Marshall, a Chicago ad executive, grew up with his showgirl mother, and is a chauvinist. He is skilled at selling to men and seducing women. However, just as he thinks he's headed for a promotion, his manager Dan informs him that he is hiring the talents of Darcy McGuire instead, to broaden the firm's appeal to women. Needing to prove himself to Darcy and Dan, Nick attempts to think of copy for a series of feminine products that Darcy gave out. However he slips and falls into his bathtub while holding an electric hairdryer, electrocuting himself. The next day, Nick wakes up able to understand women's innermost thoughts. Nick eavesdrops on women's thoughts and uses their ideas as his own, but also develops real friendships with his co-workers. But as he spends more time with Darcy, he is attracted to her. Nick and Darcy begin to spend more time together, and ultimately kiss. When he manages to trump Darcy out of her idea for a new Nike ad campaign aimed at women, he regrets his selfishness, especially as it leads to her being fired and him in a compromising situation.The film is alright, nothing too special or memorable but definitely more charming than a lot of romantic comedies. My main complaint being is just the story with Marissa Tomei's character, Mel Gibson had been trying to get a date with her as a womanizer, then when he can hear her thoughts she of course thinks he's the greatest man in the world. As soon as he starts falling for Helen Hunt, he kind of just drops Marissa making you wonder if he had really learned anything at all, it was a story that was not needed and hurt the film. Also same with the ""nerd in glasses"" girl, very dark and again not really needed or could have been a bit lighter. But What Women Want is a crisp and fun little comedy that is worth the watch, Mel and Helen were a pleasure to watch together and had good chemistry. Some very touching moments, even if the script was a bit of a cliché. But it's a harmless movie that I did enjoy over all.7/10",What Women Want
21,=G=,Flawed but enjoyable in the long run.,6,9 May 2001,"""What Women Want"" tells of a cocky male chauvinist pig advertising creative type who experiences an electric shock which gives him the power to know what women are thinking. Um, yeah, right. Well, that's the premise of this so-so typical Hollyweird love-story of sorts with Gibson playing the love interest opposite Hunt. The film takes a full hour for the setup making it a slow starter. And, the Gibson character is too likeable in the beginning...do we really need to see him dance solo ala Gene Kelly?

22,sddavis63,A Funny Movie With A Fun Cast,7,18 May 2003,"In general terms this is a very funny movie. Mel Gibson is perfect as Nick Marshall, a male chauvinist ad executive who finds himself passed over for promotion because the boss (Alan Alda) decides that he needs to bring in a hot shot female executive (Helen Hunt) to reach the female market. The fun really begins when Nick is accidentally electrocuted and mysteriously finds himself able afterward to read women's minds.We see Nick evolve as a result of his new found ability. At first he is terrified, not understanding it; then he uses the power to exploit women; finally he becomes more sensitive to women (and particularly desirous of being a better father.)I guess it's that last part that bugged me and made me give this only a 7. I was going for higher until the end of the movie. Clearly we're meant to believe that Nick has become ""superdad."" He understands the needs and emotions of his 15 year old daughter Alex and when he finds out that she has been traumatized by her date's actions at the prom, he rushes to her and spends time with her and comforts her. All well and good. He takes her home, puts her to bed and then - at 1:00 in the morning - he leaves his emotionally traumatized 15 year old daughter all alone in his apartment so he can go and make up with his boss (Hunt)? That left me cold and entirely unsympathetic to Nick, who I was beginning to like up to then.It's still a funny movie. I just didn't like the way the ending was handled.7/10",What Women Want

Gibson is a creepy guy and you know once he gets the power to read women's minds he'll get a rude awakening.  But it also pure Hollywood tripe.  While it does make Hunter an integral part of the ad campaign, it's still a movie where a man with insight into women can understand women better than they understand themselves.  Also note that Gibson really doesn't need this mind reading power.  All he needs to do is treat women decently, and really, just because he could hear women's thoughts would such a creep really turn around and start being so sweet and understanding?  Does the movie suggest that in all his years on earth he never conceived of women as feeling beings who he should be nice to?  And when it comes right down to it, he's still a creep at the end, although that pays off with an amusing sequence.In spite of being a model for product placement and a prime example of Hollywood hokum, it's generally watchable, and if there's nothing else on TV you might want to take a look.",What Women Want

25,CuriosityKilledShawn,Not good!,1,4 February 2001,"I didn't expect much from this movie and 'much' is something that we do not get. I was kind of interested by the trailer at the concept of mind reading but like UNBREAKABLE there is not enough of it.The plot is schmaltzy and clichéd and is presented in the most boring and unoriginal way. Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, an executive at an advertising company (lead characters in these type of comedies are always high-fliers, think of Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, Tim Robbins in Nothing To Lose, Anne Heche in Six Days Seven Nights or even Nic Cage in Family Man) who is very male-chauvinistic and is generally disliked by women. Then one night he is electrocuted in the bath while wearing panties and make-up, he wakes up the next morning with the ability to hear women's thoughts.This could have been cool but in a 127 minute movie (overlong) there is a window of about 40 minutes in which Mel is able to read minds and only 10 minutes of that is devoted to actually doing it. What a waste, it turns the movie into a totally pointless experience. If it had been different, if the main characters were younger, didn't have the clichéd 'high-flier' jobs or if the plot had more on it's mind than a man and a woman falling in love there could have been a cool movie here. Even the photography is bad, too many shades of brown and most of the picture out of focus with exception for the actors.Marisa Tomei is criminally underused. She is shunted into a sidecar role that fades further away as the movie progresses more and more into schmaltzy cliché. I know there are crappy sub-plots about Nick's estranged daughter (clichéd) and his attempts to abuse his 'powers' to better himself at work but these are really just there to boost the 'man and woman falling in love' story. Let's be honest, how many movies are out there are about a man and woman falling in love? Too many. Do we need any more? No. But because Mel is in it WWW has become a success.If David Schwimmer played Nick Marshall?",What Women Want

As a top advertising executive, his ads feature sexy themes and are successful. He definitely believes his boss (Alan Alda) is on the verge of promoting him to be his right hand guy at the firm. But, elsewhere, Nick is less successful. His beautiful first wife (Lauren Holly) divorced him for womanizing and he barely sees his teenage daughter. Yet, when his ex remarries, he is going to be in ""charge"" of this teen lass for a period of weeks. In addition, although Nick believes he is a stallion in the bedroom, women may not always appreciate his moves. Now, here comes change! Instead of getting the promotion, a beautiful, talented woman Darcy (Helen Hunt) gets it. Boss explains they need to reach more women with their ads and this is the way to do it. Nick is miffed. Pretending to be a fan, he truly wants to sabotage Darcy's job. Yet, at home testing women's products to get a better understanding of what women use, Nick has an accident with the blow dryer and a sink full of water. Now, when he comes to, he can LITERALLY read females' minds. All too soon, he discovers his daughter thinks he's a jerk and he tries to change her attitude. A lovely lady (Marisa Tomei), who works in a store at the same office building, teaches him how to please women in the sack. But, is he still eager to take down Darcy and won't it be infinitely easier now that he can read her thoughts and stay one step ahead? This classic romantic dramedy has an abundance of humor, mixed with great lessons on, you guessed it, what women DO want. As Nick, Gibson is a delight as he learns how to be a far better human being.

One night in a freak accident the chauvinistic Nick Marshall wakes up to learn he has the ability to know what every woman is thinking. Nick uses this gift for his own advantage. A woman named Darcy (Helen Hunt) works for the company, and Nick misses out on his promotion. Nick goes for revenge with his newfound abilities, but winds up falling for Darcy. Romantic comedies are considered to be chick flicks to many. I'm a guy, and I actually enjoy the romance genre. They tend to get a bit derivative and uncreative at times, but I still watch them as they come out. This movie is the epitome of a romantic comedy done right. Let's face it. If you're a guy, you've more than likely been confused with how a woman does things. Not only does this movie ingeniously explore that, but it does it such a smart way. I can't remember the last time I've laughed that hard in a movie. People can say what they want about Mel Gibson these days, but he was perfect for this part! He oozes charisma, and he is an absolute blast to watch. It was a lot of fun to watch him go from a cocky business man who womanizes to a person slowly, but surely becoming a regular human being with this newfound power. Mel Gibson dancing around in women's clothing, putting on makeup is unforgettable and had me howling with laughter. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt make a great pair, and there chemistry was top notch. Helen Hunt is terrific herself, in a more subtle way. She's an ideal chick for any guy with a solid head on his shoulders, so guys should love her. Alan Alda doesn't have much to do, but Marisa Tomei is very funny in a supporting role, whilst Judy Greer steals every scene she's in as the girl nobody wants to hang around. The ending actually had me well up with tears a little bit. Laugh all you want, but its true! It was just so heartwarming I couldn't help but love it. Gibson's monologue in the ending is a knockout. Is it clichéd? Of course! It's a romantic comedy, what do you expect? Do people really have to be this fickle? Don't be such a cynic! Sit back, relax, and turn your brain off.

Plot In A Paragraph: After an accident, a chauvinistic ad executive (Gibson) gains the ability to hear what women are thinking.It's interesting to hear a Gibson called ""The least politically correct guy in the universe"" and personally, I think Gibson was a little bit too old for the role, but his charisma carries it along nicely. And the movie has a great soundtrack. As for the rest of the cast, Helen Hunt has never looked better, Alan Alda is always fun to watch, as is Marisa Tomei, and it's always nice to see Valerie Perrine in a movie. One can only wonder what would have happened with Gibson's career, if he paid attention to what was said in this movie What Women Want ended 2000 the 5th highest grossing movie of the year, with a domestic haul of $182 million.

Fun and contagious, it's one of those films that wasn't made to be a work of art or to win prizes, but to amuse, entertain and have a good time. And it's effective at that.The script begins with the introduction of Nick Marshall, a misogynist womanizer who works in advertising. He thinks he is the biggest male around and considers himself a lucky man in the relationship with the opposite sex, although he doesn't particularly consider him out of the way. However, everything changes with the arrival of a new boss, Darcy. She is the agency's new creative director and will be tasked with capturing a market share that Nick can't take advantage of: female consumers. While doing some silly experiments with women's products, trying to figure out how to work with them, Nick gets an electric shock. The next day... voilà! He can hear women's thoughts, and the new and unknown world of the female mind is at his mercy!The film is excellent in every way. Of course, the story's premises are imaginative and credibility isn't even an issue because it's something so clearly invented that such a question doesn't even arise. The pace is quite fast and events continue as Nick tries to deal with his latest skill and discovers that, after all, women don't think he's as amazing as he thought. The relationship with his daughter is also convincing and well-used in the film.The cast is expertly dominated by Mel Gibson. The actor is funny, pleasant and competent in the role he was given. He's perfectly capable of taking the film through to the end, but he manages not to overshadow the brilliance of Helen Hunt, with whom he co-stars wonderfully, in a collaborative effort full of chemistry and good spirits. In a secondary but very witty character, the beautiful Marisa Tomei also does an excellent job. I also liked Ashley Johnson's work, but she has little to do, and the character demands little from the actress, in my opinion.Technically, it is a discreet film, which leaves the story told the space it needs to shine and develop, capturing our full attention. The cinematography works very well, and all the filming work was exquisitely well done, with competent use of color and light. The costumes, unsurprisingly, adapt wonderfully to the characters and the way they develop.

Anyway, he prefers to tune with women and Mel is indeed comfortable in a comedy: his telepathic ability inspire some really funny moments, especially regarding the life at work: now, i understand why we are so tired coming back home: telling something and thinking the opposite is indeed tiring! However, it's true: we must get along all day with people who are sometimes worst than awful! Beyond, this original idea is not used to its maximum as the movie sticks to the credo of American movie: over there, work stops at the manager level and happens in big corporate firm, usually in entertainment (see De Palma's ""Passion""): Thus, as real job is a bit more soliciting for people, audience should felt alienated. This was my feeling as I'm really fed up to follow the life of those privileged, living in big condos, needing staff for everything. What's revealing here is that Mel precisely falls in love with his big boss but maybe an humanist consciousness makes him notice the small archivist as well, maybe the only one true character here!In addition, the movie is a huge brainwash for advertising, which is the most devious activity ever, as its goal is to make think that the moon is full of green eye. As they said in Groland, having Nike sneakers, we don't play basketball like Mike, neither having Mont Blanc pen, write novels like Heminghway, etc...At last, i really don't understand the need to take being gay as pretext to end an relationship.

38,elshikh4,2/3 Great !,8,4 January 2009,"It's in the script, and I do mean it in a good and bad sense.First of all, this is a unique movie, since it's a romantic comedy with supernaturalism as well. And what a supernatural it is: reading the mind of the women, namely the dream of all the men! The movie's first 2 thirds are super; everything looked masterful, hitting the mark brilliantly. But the third act wasn't the same at all. From the moment of the unexplained matter of losing the superpower, till the laconic end, is nothing but a dismal, especially when all the good, funny and memorable characters, that we saw before, got no chance at all to have a final statement, or a reasonable end, or anything that equals their earlier nice noisiness.Scriptwriters (Josh Goldsmith & Cathy Yuspa)'s fantasy factor wasn't built on solid ground, or even got its own fantastic logic, which was something you would witness again in their next project (13 Going on 30 - 2004). The storyline of (Marisa Tomei) was trivial, and just for assuring how the lead's character, by his lie about himself as gay, would go straight in his new relationship. It didn't also give us the great chance to see how the man's man would do when he got fired at the end, or how he would work under the authority of his woman lover; which's a never done post-climax.Obviously, we have a very smart script as a criminal here, which mistreated the third act. But save that, the obscene talk, and the nasty jokes, we have an enjoyable movie, that got the esprit, rhythm, and the glamour of (Sinatra)'s songs; which's something not existent in any of today's movies. It even managed somehow to be a very rare superhero movie where the main idea is so cinematic, and not based on comics.(Nancy Meyers) handled the job of directing so fine, I think it has something to do with the fact that she's a scriptwriter herself. She knows the good script when she sees one, still in love with the intelligent determined working women like her movies as a writer (Private Benjamin - 1980), (Jumpin' Jack Flash - 1986), (I Love Trouble - 1994), and as a director she's capable of transforming the witness into image, performance, and lovely pace.Look at the movie's smooth status like a dream, no, it is a dream comes true. It has some amusing moments when all the elements succeeded in giving it a tasty flavor. For instances: the scenes of the lead alone in his apartment; there is so serene sense about them, the montage of the daughter trying to select the right dress with (Christina Aguilera) singing ""What a Girl Wants"", the shot of (Mel Gibson) standing in the face of fate, asking to take his gift back; that was the top of them all, summarizing the movie's distinctive talents, and its magical personality in general.(Gibson) looks great in his very late first romantic comedy, or his first pure comedy without action. The 44-year-old star used his real gifts to dazzle us with some brilliant performance that I didn't expect it to be as very good as this. He owns the role as if he is (Nick Marshall) in his real life! (Helen Hunt) is a mine of live emotions. She can deliver at least 10 different reactions in one scene so simply, also her vocal performance was perfectly sharp, confidence, and sentimental exactly like her character.The writing mastered all the scenes that got a mind reading, to be one of the movie's treasures. The too many characters made such a wonderful world around with fancy details. I loved the basic wicked idea of it, where the man is just intimidated by the woman's intelligence. The message of a more sensitive man, or believes in women, was well put, where the whole thing is about how he must ""Listen carefully"", yet not in a deceitful or manipulative way.Actually (What Women Want) has the rare ability to attract men and women equally. Believe it or not, my most male-fanatic male friends love it so much! It will live long as a classic example for a highly entertaining meaningful movie that we wouldn't have many of it along the years, a solid romantic comedy where there is some analyzing for its 2 main characters, and as a movie where everything is great except its third act, and little moments. Although this makes it not on the top of them, but it's definitely one of my favorites.",What Women Want

I know that laughs and ""comedy"" were the intended goal of this film here, but, all the same, aren't us men supposed to be the ""shallow"" gender of the 2 sexes? I mean, aren't we? Like, maybe I've been all wrong about the female gender, all along - 'Cause if women really do want what this movie says that they want, then what women want seems to be exactly what men want. Which is, sad to say, fairly predictable stuff. And, so, with that in mind, I'd say that this movie pretty much renders women as being just as shallow, if not more, than us men.I find it really amazing that not only was ""What Women Want"" directed by a woman, but half of the screenplay credit goes to a woman, as well. With the shallow, pretentious, and petty way in which women are portrayed in this film, I was certain that not even one single woman had been consulted in any way, shape, or form to find out what they really want.Anyways - In a non-specific gender nutshell, here's ""What Women Want"" is all about - Mel Gibson, that big-mouthed bigot, plays Nick Marshall, a vain, womanizing S.O.B. (Hey! You know, that sounds an awful lot like Mel Gibson just playing Mel Gibson to me) One fine morning Nick gets all of his brain-circuits fried, big time, when he falls into a bathtub full of water while in the midst of blow-drying his pretty-pretty hair.One could only hope that being electrocuted in this fashion would kill Gibson/Nick instantly. But, no, unfortunately, it doesn't. And, so, for the sake of the movie, what electrocution does to Nick, instead, is it enables him to hear the thoughts of women. (Now, does that make sense to you?) Naturally, being the slimy prick that he is, Nick uses this amazing ability to his full advantage (of course, who wouldn't?) by manipulating women as best he can. Especially his new female boss, played by Helen Hunt, who just happened to land this very job position that he (being the scoundrel that he is) figured was solely entitled to him.Anyhow - To make a long story, short - If you can believe it, or not, there's actually a ""romance"" of sorts that transpires in all of this thought-reading nonsense that is even more far-fetched than you can ever imagine.In conclusion - If what women want really is this movie, then, all I can say is, THEY CAN BLOODY-WELL HAVE IT!! - 'Cause, being a man, I sure as hell don't want it!

Woooooo hooooooo!   Oops, got carried away there. But it just goes to show you that even we devoutly heterosexual guys realize he's kinda hot. And that's important for this film to work. Mel plays Nick, an incredibly sexist, egotistical, arrogant, womanizing ad-agency executive. He's the kind of guy who guys want to be and who women want to have. This might explain his popularity a little. Nick's all set to get the big promotion he feels he deserves - to Creative Director of his ad agency. His boss and mentor Dan (Alan Alda) calls him into his office for a talk. Nick's all ready for the big news. Can't wait for the corner office on the 44th floor. And then Dan drops the bombshell on poor Nick. Not only isn't he getting the promotion, Dan's hired someone else to take the job! And not only that, it's a woman! So now our poor spoiled boy - who has seen women as either sex objects or hired help, and sometimes both - has to report directly to a woman. Oh, poor, poor Nick. Yes, I can practically hear you ladies out there, just oozing with empathy for this lost soul. A fine comeuppance, you're thinking. He's getting what he deserves, you think. His new boss, Darcy (Helen Hunt), in her first staff meeting, hands out kits to each of the ad people that contain ""feminine"" products (such as lipstick, padded bras, eyeliner, stockings, and, of course, wax). She wants the company to start paying more attention to the female consumer, noting that billions of dollars were spent by females the previous year, and none of that cash went to their company. So Nick takes the stuff home and, drunk on wine, tries it all on. Has to keep his job, you know. And minutes later, a freak electrical accident involving a bathtub and a hair dryer leaves Nick with the most dubious of gifts: the ability to read the minds of women. Hmm. I don't know about my fellow males, but I'm not sure I want to read the minds of women. As if reading their minds would help me understand anything! But poor, poor Nick. He hears EVERYTHING women (even a female poodle) are thinking, with the predicted madcap hilarity. But it's spooky for our favorite chauvinist. What's he to do? Well, he IS a chauvinist. So he uses his newfound ability to steal Darcy's ideas and present them as his own! What a guy! The movie wouldn't be all that wondeful with only one plot going on around Nick, so we get the added pleasure of him having to ""watch"" his 15-year-old daughter while his ex-wife is on her honeymoon, of him dealing with a semisweet, semipsychotic coffeehouse babe, of him dealing with a mousy coworker/underling. It's all presented to make Nick's life look chaotic, although there are few people who wouldn't trade places with him in general (except for that mind-reading thing). I mean, let's face it. He's attractive to women, has money, and... well, what else is there, really? So how does this comedy of telepathy end? It's not unpredictable. Knowing that Nick is stealing Darcy's ideas, how do you think he'd resolve his situation? And knowing the peripheral plots, how do you think he'll tie them all together?   Because of Gibson's seemingly endless charm (like Cary Grant, he can simply grin sheepishly and win hearts), this movie stays afloat. He has a capable, if not distinguishable, supporting cast.

The movie is utterly predictable, even down to the exact lines of dialogue used (towards the end I was guessing the next line with my friend by whispering quietly to each other the ""next line"" - which was quite easy.) Having said that, I enjoyed it immensely, as have most people I know who have been to see it. Gibson plays the comic well, has almost learnt to dance, has absolutely know chemistry with his opposite number (Helen Hunt), but this is straightforward entertainment, accurately contrasting the extremes of how men and women think differently and playing the audience for laughs. Believable? No. Good light-hearted entertainment that doesn't take itself seriously? Yes! The addition of a competent song-and-dance routine probably would have earned it very minor classic status rather than just popular fun.",What Women Want

45,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Charming, romantic, fantastic, heart-warming, sweet, and funny romantic comedy",10,18 November 2005,"In my opinion, WHAT WOMEN WANT is a charming, romantic, fantastic, heart-warming, sweet, and funny romantic comedy. After Nick (Mel Gibson) had that little accident, I was amazed at the fact that he could read women's minds. When he heard what the little female poodle in the park was thinking, I burst out laughing! If you ask me, Lola (Marisa Tomei) was an absolutely snobby woman most of the time! It's hard for me to explain why. At one point in the movie, I wanted to say, ""What is this? A spin-off of BOOMERANG?"" I thought that Darcy (Helen Hunt) was a beautiful woman, especially in the attire she wore for work. If you ask me, she and Nick made the perfect match. When she and Nick danced together, I thought that was absolutely sweet. Also, I thought that Alex (Ashley Johnson) looked absolutely gorgeous in all the prom dresses she tried on, especially the long, black one with the spaghetti straps. If you ask me, the music was very nice. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have scored big!"" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Mel Gibson or Helen Hunt, I recommend this movie. You're in for a real treat and lots of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it. You'll be glad you did.",What Women Want

Not only is she as beautiful in many ways as Mr. Gibson (from one straight guy to another) Ashley Johnson is as good an actor.

Well right there is a great premise for a romantic comedy , you know your gonna get something funny. And you do.This is a very cute movie that is at times touching, at times sugary sweet, at other times just funny. It also stars Mel Gibson as the male lead and he's pretty good in this role. One thing about many romantic comedies is that the female all to often, carries the movie while the male lead can come across as pretty generic. Not here. Nick, the male lead, is very real and a genuinely interesting character as is Hunt's character.Helen Hunt was the perfect choice to play the Corporate executive and Nick's ultimate dream woman. Her chemistry with Gibson, while not being in your face hot, was subtle and interesting and somewhat more realistic then many on screen couples. All performances were good and the movie, while being another thickly formulated romantic comedy went about it's formula in such a fun imaginative way, it was nice. This is not a great movie and not one that will make my list of must Sees. It is however a bit more clever then some movies of this genre and it's a good choice for a rental. This is a fun movie, a romantic comedy done in a surprisingly clever way that rates about a 6.5 but I'll Give the acting a higher score.

It may well be a ""chick-flick"" but at least there was enough humor in it to make it watchable for me. The movie contains good, although perhaps not always very original jokes. Still, it made me laugh several times, so that's OK.Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a ""man's man"". He's an egocentric career hunter who thinks he is loved by all women. After he gets electrocuted in his bath tub he can read every woman's mind. At first he wants to get rid of this ability, but than he makes the best out of it and uses his hidden knowledge to his advantage. The main storyline is based on the relation between Helen Hunt's character Darcy McGuire and Gibson's character Nick Marshall. But thanks to the underlying storyline with Nick's daughter ""What Women Want"" may appeal to a wider audience. I guess that a lot of (divorced) parents of young teenagers will see a lot of similarities between themselves and Nick and his daughter.""What Women Want"" is a funny movie that shouldn't only be seen by women.

51,KUAlum26,"Make-cute,high-concept gimmick as Gibson/Hunt vehicle",7,26 February 2007,"Ad exec whiz Nick Marshall(Mel Gibson,in a rare breath of comedic air between ""Epic"" historical/heavy drama films like Braveheart,Hostage,The Patriot,Signs and Passion of the Christ)has loved the ladies nearly all his life. Well,maybe not ""loved"" them so much as enjoyed their company,and they've been more than willing to return the favor. But his opinions of them lie in the range of ""mildly misogynistic"" and the one work pal he does have(Mark Feuerstein),shares that opinion enthusiastically. When Nick is trumped in his quest for a promotion by a heady newcomer to the Chicago firm he holds court in,and that newcomer is an attractive woman named Darcy(Helen Hunt,topping off nearly a decade of t.v. and movie success at this point),this puts Nick's figurative manhood in a sling. To make matters even more embarrassing,he has to test women's toiletry products on his own time to come up with brainstorming ideas for the ad campaign for said products.This,of course,greases the wheels for the rest of this plot,which is as high-concept as a movie could get:Nick electrocutes himself in a mishap involving the products,he discovers through this mishap that he can hear into women's thoughts,he(at first)uses this knowledge for his own selfish gain(which includes getting into the pants of a lovely but neurotic barrista,played by underused MArisa Tomei),then finds himself stirred to act to help a lonely and potentially suicidal copy girl(Judy Greer,making the full most of a small part)and his own shy,insecure and pressured daughter(Ashley Johnson). All the while,he's building(see if you can't see THIS coming)a romance with the savvy,smart but attracted Darcy.Directed by charm lord(lordess?)Nancy Meyers,who struck gold with the Father of the Bride movies and 2004's Something's Gotta Give,has laid out a nice,harmless movie for Gibson(regardless of what you think of him personally)to use his talent for physical comedy and personal charisma to full effect. Hunt seems to be almost a backdrop to the action,a mere device to build the sexual tension and ""Make-cute"" feel of the film.

53,mattymatt4ever,Hilarious! A laugh a minute!,8,28 May 2001,"Mel Gibson is known as sort of a macho action hero, and stereotyped into his Mad Max/Martin Riggs persona.  But I've noticed (except for ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"") he injects comic relief into almost anything he does.  So doing a straight comedy doesn't seem like much of a stretch, and as you watch in a movie like this Gibson's timing and delivery is impeccable.  On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags.The premise is very original and interesting.  A guy who can hear a woman's every thought?  That's pretty much every man's fantasy.  And the premise is used wisely.  I laughed the whole way through!  It's hilarious to watch Gibson emasculating himself by the minute, and the joke never runs dry. 
I was laughing so much that I was able to tolerate the film's corny ending. I mean, when is a romantic comedy going to come along that doesn't feature a formulaic ending that is supposed to make people leave the theater and go ""Awwww""?The supporting cast is full of big stars.  Bette Midler has an amusing cameo as a chain-smoking shrink.  I only wish she could've had some additional scenes.

54,jhclues,Does Anyone Really Know? Even Mel?,8,17 January 2001,"Here is a movie that, to be sure, is part fantasy, part wacky comedy; but to call `What Women Want,' directed by Nancy Meyers, `just' a comedy would be not only inaccurate, but would be doing an injustice to the film as well. Because-- while there are plenty of laughs to be had (especially early on)-- in the end, there is a lot more bite and substance to it than first meets the eye.  Enough to definitely raise it far above the `fluff' piece many will perceive it to be, if only due to some shallow reviews and the theatrical trailer currently being shown, which gives only the vaguest notion of what this movie is really all about.  In fact, once most of the `cute' stuff is out of the way (about a third of the way through), the film really starts to get good,with a message about decency that is worthwhile, if only it can penetrate the formidable barrier of the viewer with an attention span barely able to accommodate an episode of `Friends.'  Beyond the humor, there is a story here about a man named Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) who literally receives the shock of his life, and afterwards must deal with who he is by coming to terms with his past, realizing the truth about himself in the present, and understanding what his future will be if he does not change his ways .  It's something of a contemporary take on `A Christmas Carol,' with Nick an egotistical, self-centered, witty (In his own eyes) Scrooge; a veritable legend in his own mind, which is not-- as he comes to find out-- necessarily the way he is perceived by many of those around him, especially the women in his professional life. 	The screenplay, written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, is extremely insightful and brought to the screen with equal acuity by director Meyers, who goes to great lengths at the beginning of the film to explain Nick's exaggerated chauvinism, what made him the `Man's man' he has become.  And while it is clever and effective, closer scrutiny in the editing room may have benefited the overall film, as his character is somewhat `overly' established.  But just about at the point when you're saying to yourself, `All right I get it!' Meyers grabs the helm with both hands and suddenly the ship is at full mast and on course, where she keeps it for the rest of the journey.  The turning point comes after Nick's visit to a marriage counselor (a terrific cameo by Bette Midler) with whom he had had business some years before.  It's as if not only Nick, but Meyers as well, had heeded Bette's advice. 	Mel Gibson does a good job of getting into Nick Marshall's skin, and he's to be commended for going out on a limb and taking on a character that may not be immediately embraced by even die-hard Gibson fans.  It's a testimony to his ability as an actor, though, because he does make Nick the epitome of chauvinism, and except for the few throw-back Neanderthals (women as well as men) still in existence who subscribe to the `Man's man' theory of de-evolution, Nick will effect the same response from the audience that he does in the minds of many of the women who surround him in the movie.  It's only when you've had a chance to consider Gibson's performance at arm's length that you will realize how good he is in this film.  On the other hand, the real saving grace of this movie is immediately discernible, and that is the performance of the wonderful Helen Hunt.  As Darcy McGuire, the professional hired to lead the ad agency for whom Nick works into the Twenty-first Century, Hunt is nothing less than sensational.  One of the most gifted, expressive actors in the business, she raises the level of the drama (not to mention the comedy) by succinctly conveying the strength-- and at the same time the vulnerability-- of Darcy, while exhibiting a depth of emotion that adds so much to the impact (and the success) of the film. And, in a notable supporting role, Judy Greer is memorable as Erin, a lonely young woman who works at the ad agency.  It's the `Tiny Tim' role of the film, and though a small part, it figures prominently in revealing Nick's inner-most feelings at a pivotal moment of the film. 	Rounding out the supporting cast are Alan Alda (Dan), Marisa Tomei (Lola), Ashley Johnson (Alexandra), Mark Feuerstein (Morgan), Lauren Holly (Gigi), Delta Burke (Eve), Valerie Perrine (Margo) and Sarah Paulson (Annie).  What Meyers has created here is a mixed-bag, sleight-of-hand bit of entertainment that is so much more than what it seems to be on the surface that it is bound to evoke an equally mixed-bag of reactions (positive and negative) from the audience.  It's amusing-- downright funny at times-- but also exasperating.  To receive the full rewards offered by `What Women Want,' you're going to have to give it something as well.  If you do, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you get in return.  And that, my friends, is the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",What Women Want
55,Stampsfightclub,enjoyable romantic comedy,7,8 January 2007,"Mel Gibson (Braveheart) stars as Nick Marshall, a flirtatious big headed popular sales assistant in this likable romantic comedy about a guy who can read women's thoughts.Through his confident image, Marshall is presented as a stereotyped womaniser in this 2000 hit rom-com and through his character audiences are able to hear what women 'really' think. It's a laugh I suppose that women are stereotyped and are presented through the media as thinking such thoughts in their head such as how they hate guys who constantly ask them out, detest their bosses, think the way they think. By stereotyping these thoughts audiences can accept the roles of the characters and have a laugh about what women really do want.Its one of those films which is easy to watch and have a good laugh with as Gibson tries to cope with the 'calamity' of a situation he is in and Helen Hunt (As Good as it gets) also acts acceptably in her role as the new advertising division leader. The two perform well together although personally the ending was a huge disappointment for me, too clichéd and a tad disjointed, making the rest of the movie appear less acceptable to accept.One scene involving Gibson is fantastic where he is alone in his apartment and dancing with the hat to the music which is great enjoyment and allows audiences to relax when watching him turn on the charm. That scene too dragged for a bit after a while.There are many scenes which are very easy to laugh to and enjoy. Like all other romantic comedies there is a seriousness towards the central plot and also many side stories, one involving Gibson's relationship with his daughter which is portrayed as sweet and heart tearing but personally I wasn't too convinced.The plot moves at a steady pace to begin with but once Gibson has his 'power' and uses it to his advantage does the plot start to push itself and become more interesting. Apart from the ending and a few unrealistic scenes the film is enjoyable and perfect to watch with partner or on a date to laugh at what women and men want from relationships and society.watch it if...you like to laugh at relationship issues and gentle romantic portrayals of men and women",What Women Want
56,adamscastlevania2,"It's lightweight, yet oddly worth tracking down",6,15 December 2014,"(54%) A throwback of sorts to the frothy romantic comedies of the 50's and 60's, only here it stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt rather than Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Audrey Hepburn, or maybe even Marilyn Monroe. And it's not just the inclusion of swing music in the soundtrack, but also the general look and feel in which this is assembled together; also the mostly light- hearted nature and bubbly concept has a trace of a past period's charm. Gibson is on very good form here in the leading role in which he clearly put a lot of effort into, and the premise is used fairly well with enough humour and bite to the writing for the movie to never really bog down or become overly silly. At around 2 hours long it does stretch itself too far, and the parts dealing with a depressed co-worker drags the movie out and poorly fits in with everything else this has in terms of tone. For what it is, and how awful it could have been, this is a perfectly good entry into Gibson's filmography.",What Women Want
57,gbheron,"Neat Plot, Good Chemistry (Little Spoilers)",8,21 July 2002,"This is a chick flick that guys will enjoy. Why? Well, for one thing it has a very inventive plot. The protagonist, Nick Marshal (Mel Gibson) is a chauvinist ad executive. He's not cruel to women, just old school, like a 1950s Hugh Hefner character. The men in ""What Women Want"" are not cut from the same bolt of cloth as the monsters in ""In the Company of Men"", not by a long shot. But when Nick is passed over for an anticipated promotion, and for an outsider and a woman, Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt). Gads, he besides himself. He's going to get that job! He'll act nice to her face, but torpedo her career from behind the scenes. This activity gets an unanticipated boost when a bathroom accident with a hair dryer and bathtub full of water leaves Nick with an unusual power. He can hear women think. After his initial amazement and concern, he harnesses this power to help him in his nefarious scheme (and to become a great lover). But wait! Something unanticipated happens; he becomes sensitive, and falls in love with Darcy.""What Women Want"" is not too drenched in estrogen, and its companion problem, socio-political propaganda. All too often, this renders romance movies unwatchable. This is more like a 1940s screw-ball comedy, and doesn't take itself too seriously. And finally, and probably most importantly, there is a good chemistry between Gibson and Hunt. They're very good together. You root for them.
The bottom line is that I heartily recommend this movie. It's a good rental for the whole family, not just the women.",What Women Want
58,Bob-45,"What Women Want? Hopefully, Nothing This Insipid.",6,26 May 2001,"""What Women Want"" is frequently amusing and entertaining. Unfortunately it is also overlong, giving it plenty of time to be overly simplistic, ""politically correct"" and condescending to both men and women.Mel Gibson is very funny (and a very good dancer), but he is waytoo soft and squishy to play a ruthless, chauvenistic advertising executive. Helen Hunt is also entertaining and attractive (in a ""school marmish"" sort of way) as the advertising guru who is brought in by agency head, Alan Alda, to find out ""What Women Want"").  Hunt has a great body, but, as I said, is too ""school marmish"" to use it to full advantage, and fails to create the kind of chemistry needed to make this romance even a bit convincing. Worse, she is way to ""nice"" to be even slightly convincing as a ruthless ""bitch"" senior advertising executive.  Hunt would have suspected SOMETHING, even if she didn't realize Gibson could read her mind. If you want to see this kind of character done extremely well, see Jennifer Anniston in ""Picture Perfect"".  Hunt's character, as written, is a complete washout. None of the women in this movie are particularly well written.  Especially wasted are such fine actresses as Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine.  At worst, it is a crying shame to see such as talented and beautiful actress as Marisa Tomei being so ill treated by her role. Tomei (and the character) are too intelligent to talk herself into tosuch a ridiculous fantasy explaining Gibson's treatment of her.Perhaps the truest scene in the movie occurs when Gibson, first using his ability to read women's minds, overhears how one of his female associates uses Advil instead of Aspirin or Tylenol when she doesn'twant to have sex with her husband.  When Gibson broaches the idea ALL of the women deny they would EVER do such a thing.  And there lies the truth of it.  Reading a women's mind (or a man's mind, for that matter) wouldn't necessarily help, BECAUSE WE ALL LIE TO OURSELVES, SOMETIMES.The ""woman as victim"" plot has been around at least as long as ""Broken Blossems"" (1919).  Dean Martin certainly used it a lot when he was still Jerry Lewis's sidekick.  It reminds me of the bad feminist joke ""If they can put a man on the moon, why don't they ALL go?"" To which, I reply, ""Then on WHOM would you have to blame all your problems?""  Men and Women ARE different, just as ALL individuals are different.  However, this insipid movie sheds little light on our differences.  Fortunately, by the end, it redeems itself somewhat, by exposing those needs that are common to ALL individuals. We ALL need to be respected, valued and loved.",What Women Want

Mel Gibson fits just in perfectly as the somewhat cocky, macho who does not treat women correctly just as Helen Hunt fits in perfectly as the adorable, warmhearted, smart, career - making woman. But all of Mel Gibson's character seems to change after he get's 'the gift'. The fact that he can hear what women think, provides a number of hilarious scenes, but luckily this film also shows some romance and some emotional which I liked very much. Call me a softie, but I enjoyed myself immensely and found myself smiling after I had seen the film - not really knowing why - but the whole thing was just adorable, as were the Mel Gibson's and Helen Hunt's character.
There was just one question that haunted me after seeing the film and the extra features on DVD: 'Who had the guts to make such crappy extra's for a film that GOOD?' I mean come on. Where are the bloopers and stuff. I happen to know Mel Gibson is something of a goofball sometimes and I'm sure there must have been something more interesting than the behind the scenes and interview crap  they put on that disc.

The final conclusion is that they want happiness, just like men.Despite being a predictable movie and nothing extraordinary, at least it teaches to us (men) some valuable lessons about women. It's a good way to understand and know them better.The first hour of this movie is great fun, very entertaining and pure comedy. During the first hour we have some moments to give us good laughs. Mel Gibson has never been this funny before. He plays a hilarious character: Nick Marshall, a typical ""macho men"" or a ""men's man"". The kind of man that other men admire and want to be like him. The kind of man who doesn't understand a thing about women (although seen as a ""God's gift"" to women). Nick is proud, rich, chauvinistic, single and loves to hear Frank Sinatra.After an accident with the hairdryer, he suddenly has the power of hearing what women think and what they think of him isn't what he expected.

Some ridiculous and silly things happen in the second half. Also, I rather the ""old"" Nick than the ""good"" Nick, because the ""old"" Nick was much funnier. He becomes the ""good guy"" in the second half, losing his sense of humor.This movie has some nice songs, such as ""I Won't Dance"" (performed by Frank Sinatra), ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" (performed by Frank Sinatra in a duet with Bono) and ""Bitch"" (performed by Meredith Brooks).Mel Gibson is great and charming as Nick Marshall, while Helen Hunt is okay and pretty in the role of Darcy McGuire.",What Women Want
66,kenandraf,Truth hurts?,9,16 December 2000,"This movie was very brave in shelling out the GENERAL truth about the core of women's tendency to overblow issues.The bottom line is that women have insecurities regarding all the things they have to do to be considered accomplished in this materialistic plane of existence.Men GENERALLY deal with life's issues better than women becouse nature has meant it to be that way.Nature has set it up for women in a way where they have to worry about being dominated by the generally physically stronger sex.When men say women have penis envy,we do not mean that women want to specifically have a penis.We mean that in the women's subconcious,they know they have some handicaps regarding having to deal with pregnancy,a weaker muscle tone,and estrogen induced tendencies towards more difficulty handling emotion (compared to men).This does not mean to say that men are better than women.It only means that women have issues due to the additional handicaps placed on them by nature as nurturers.As natural nurturers,women have to be set up in a way that they would be more in touch with their emotions so they would be less likely to abandon our offspring.The world has evolved and is very different now from those caveman times but we still carry those traits with us and we are supposed to train ourselves to abandon those old programmed ways.There is nothing wrong with women moving away from those traditional roles as full time dependant nurturers but the painfull reality is that the programmed natural handicaps are still there and women constantly have to deal with them every single day of their life.A lot of women were insulted when they were exposed in this movie.It is embarrasing to women to be exposed that way for humor and I sympathise for those who did not appreciate it.But the truth of the movie about what women want GENERALLY was depicted accurately.Women are very talented,very capable human beings too but please do not pretend those natural handicaps they carry with them do not exist.As a matter of fact,it is very admirable how women are strong enough to go thru this very competitive plane of existence.That is why I snap at men who sometimes think it is easier to be a woman due to their sexual hold over men.Those men better think twice before being too eager to go  thru what a woman generally goes thru day by day.The movie's weaknesses was it's political incorrectness,and a miscast Helen Hunt(Tomei was not Anglo-Saxon enough for Hunt's role?).For people who do not mind fact based political incorectness,this movie will be very entertaining indeed.The lesson here in this movie is that for men who want to take their charms to the next level(beyond just physical,mental,spiritual and material charms),they must learn to tap into their inner woman.Study women's core issues and empathise with them.It is not easy to be in their shoes but to truly be a woman's dream man,a man must learn to wear those heels(not literally!) and still be masculinely intact.Men must learn to share women's burdens.This movie delivers that message very well.Peace......",What Women Want

72,Movie-12,Charming and amusingly funny. Gibson and Hunt are a cute couple--but a bad ending. *** (out of four),7,28 January 2001,"WHAT WOMEN WANT / (2000) *** (out of four) By Blake French:	In the year 2000 alone, Mel Gibson portrayed a colonial-times rebel in ""The Patriot,"" arrogant poultry in ""Chicken Run,"" and now a hotshot chauvinist in Nancy Meyers' new romantic comedy ""What Women Want."" Mel Gibson has slick, suave charm and electric charisma in the role of a self-confident advertising executive. All of his seemingly natural talents combine to create a funny, entertaining character named Nick Marshall. The adorable Helen Hunt has the same amiable traits as her irresistible co-star as she lights up the screen with a gentle personality and glowing elegance. With a respectable supporting cast, including Marisa Tommei, Alan Alda, Lauren Holly, and Bette Midler, it is hard to imagine how ""WhatWomen Want"" could have failed to entertain audiences.Nick Marshal obviously does not know what women want. He was raised as a testosterone-based bachelor, with the idea that he is the world's gift to all females. As a rich executive on the verge of a big promotion from his boss, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), he is not pleased when a young, ambitious woman named Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) gets the position instead of him. To make matters worse for Nick, his ex-wife (Lauren Holly) has just remarried, leaving him their somewhat rebellious fifteen year old daughter for two weeks, and his attempts to bed a coffee shop employee named Lola (Marisa Tomei) are continuing to fail.	Everything changes for Nick after he experiences an accidental electrical shock that leaves him with the ability to read the minds of any female person. He abruptly pays a visit to his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler) who wakes him up on his unique gift that could be used to his advantage. He immediately takes charge of his new gift; it is interesting, funny, and always amusing to witness his reactions to women's personal thoughts and desires. The screenwriters take full use of the comic material, and use it selectively and wisely; the humor never gets in the way of the movie's message about a modern-day ladies man. By the end of the movie, Nick is a much better person than he was at the beginning of the story.	""What Women Want"" is written with a sharp edge; the dialogue is poignant and sassy, the characters are witty, sexy, and often hilarious. However, there is also a positively sweet sentiment holding all of the material together and helping the story flow smoothly. There is plenty of effective comic content here, naturally revolving around Nick's ability to read the women's minds. The movie also develops Gibson's character well, and the lessons he learns about women are never too preachy or emotional to turn audiences off to the light-hearted humor. I also liked the unique direction by Nancy Meyers, whose style is keen and slick, sometimes taking the point of view of the woman in focus, allowing us to experience a variety of perspectives. She and writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa provide the leads with a lot of juicy material, and they take advantage of it all.
	""What Women Want"" falls into the usual pattern of concluding in a conventionally sweet, happy ending. The final romantic sequence feels contrived and unconvincing, unsettling, like a meet cute during a disappointing finally. Even the smiling faces of Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson cannot save a conclusion that is confusing and perplexing. After the movie, I asked a handful of audience members of their interpretation on the closing, and I got a handful of different responses, only one actually cleared up the whole situation for me. What a umbrage to a generally enjoyable romantic comedy.",What Women Want
73,FlickJunkie-2,"The comedy sparkles, the romance fizzles",7,2 June 2001,"Clearly what women want is as much Mel Gibson as they can get.  This combination comedy and love story starts smartly, but unravels when the love story attempts to take itself seriously.  However, that didn't keep the film from topping $200 Million worldwide at the box office.Nick Marshall is a `man's man', a self-absorbed chauvinist who has little respect for women.  When his big promotion is given to Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt), Nick plots for a way to bring her down.  In the course of trying out women's products to get `the female perspective', he accidentally electrocutes himself, giving himself the power to read women's minds. Though highly contrived (why only women's thoughts?), the comedic gimmick is novel and produces numerous hilarious moments.  Nick decides he is going to use his special powers to undermine Darcy in her position and seduce her in the process.  Predictably, they fall in love, which leads to a soulless, but schmaltzy romance that throws a cold bucket of water on the merriment.Director Nancy Meyers has written a number of successful lightweight comedies (`Private Benjamin', `Father of the Bride', `The Parent Trap'), often teaming with her husband, director Charles Shyer.  This is her second directorial project after `The Parent Trap' and is by far the most ambitious project she has undertaken.  It is clear here that comedy is her strong suit.  The comedy bits are well done and the gimmick is liberally explored with good results.  In contrast, the romance is stilted and unnatural (due in part to the abysmal chemistry between Gibson and Hunt) and Meyers doesn't know when to quit, pouring it on ad nauseam.Mel Gibson is the right actor for the comedy and the wrong actor for the romance.  He has always done well at wry macho comedy (See Lethal Weapon 1-4), but when it comes to romance, he's a dud.  Though intoxicating to the female eye, Gibson is all thumbs when it comes to sensitive and sentimental interchanges.  Like Nick, Gibson is a `man's man' and he is unable to bring the character to the proper transition.  Helen Hunt often reminds me of Jody Foster in that she seems like a man trapped in a woman's body.  However, unlike Foster, Hunt doesn't seem comfortable in that prison and always comes across as if she is having a gender crisis.  Whereas Foster is an electrifying actor who is obviously at ease with her no-bull personality, Hunt feels compelled to force out her sensitive side, making her constantly appear awkward and unnatural.  This disconnect is particularly grating here, especially given Gibson's handicap in the sentimentality department.  The one compensation is that Hunt's deadpan seriousness is a comedic asset in her role as straight-woman (which is one of the primary reasons `Mad About You' succeeded on TV).Once again, Marisa Tomei proves that she is one of the most underrated actors in film with a show stopping performance as Lola.  I have often wondered why she doesn't get meatier roles.  She has mostly been relegated to quirky character roles, where she invariably outshines the leads.  Her confrontation with Nick here is one of the highlights of the film.This film is easy to like.  It can be forgiven its abortive attempt at matchmaking between Gibson and Hunt simply because the comedy bits are so funny.  I rated it a 7/10.  If Meyer had kept the romance light and lively, it could have been much better.",What Women Want

I'm not sure I bought totally into the chemistry between the two, and the ending could have been more comic rather than feel-good.

Pretty soon the two start hitting it off with business and pleasure. Gibson and Hunt have great chemistry together in ""What Women Want"" thanks to director Nancy Meyers. Plus there are some very funny moments in the film. Gibson can always play comedy in his movies (his popular ""Lethal Weapon"" action movies are proof of that), and does it wonderfully here. Besides Gibson and Hunt, the terrific cast includes Marisa Tomei, Lauren Holly, Alan Alda, Mark Feuerstein, Ashley Johnson, Delta Burke, Valerie Perrine, and in a very funny uncredited cameo, Bette Midler.

Gibson stars as Nick Marshall, a good looking ladies man who works at an advertising agency. When the job he thinks he's supposed to get, ends up going to a woman named Darcy (Hunt), he gets a little annoyed. That night he ends up almost killing himself by electrocution in a bathtub, but instead ends up with the amazing ability to read women's minds. This of course freaks him out, but after a trip to a family psychologist (Bette Midler) he realizes the possibilities. He decides to try and undermine his new boss Darcy and get her kicked out so he can take her job. Along the way he starts to find out what everyone really thinks about it, and he finds out he's not as well-liked as he thought. From co-workers to his own daughter, people see him as a male chauvinist among other things, and women generally don't like him. He starts to become more in tune with what women want, and starts to change and care more about the women he used to just sleep with and kick out. Soon he realizes that he's in love with Darcy, but it may be too late. He nailed a big account, but he used what was in Darcy's thoughts to get it, and she might be out of a job, unless Nick can come in and save the day.
What Women Want had a lot of potential for some great comedic scenes, but instead sort of floundered between comedy and drama. Mel Gibson is a very engaging personality (as well as being my favorite actor) and could have easily made this into a very funny movie, but instead the plot went dramatic. There was a story line that dealt with one woman feeling un-wanted and considering suicide. I'm not sure what role that played in the movie, other than helping to make the film much too long. If I (or any other man) had the ability to read women's minds, I don't think my first thought would be to undermine my new boss and try and take her job. I'm not sure what my first thought would be, but it probably would include the removal of women's clothes or something. There were a lot of things that weren't very necessary, like the scene with Marisa Tomei (who by the way has never looked worse) where Nick admits to something that isn't true. Scenes like that seemed just thrown in there, and weren't needed. The movie clocked in at over 2 hours, and could have easily been made in an hour and a half and still hit all the points it needed to hit. As much as I enjoy Mel Gibson, after a while I just kept waiting for a point to be made. As I said, Gibson is one of my favorite actors, so any movie he's in immediately gets a thumbs up. In this role he was able to use his charm and likeability well. Helen Hunt manages to play her role well enough, but I'm starting to notice that every character she plays is almost the same. Same quirky smile, same ""hmm"", same looks. She needs to start branching out a bit more as an actress before she starts to get stale. The supporting cast was good, but not a huge part of the movie. The soundtrack was great, where else can you get Frank Sinatra, Christina Aguilera and a song named ""Bitch"" all in one movie? The idea behind the movie was a good one, but not used as well as it could have been. Had the writer and director decided exactly what they wanted the movie to be, a comedy, drama or dramedy, maybe it would have been better, but it went back and forth too much and lacked focus. If you like Mel Gibson (even if you don't like him as much as I do), you'll like What Women Want. He's got charm to spare, and carries the entire movie on his back. It's got some funny moments, but also some serious ones. The story jumps back and forth and needed to be centered a bit more, but in the end, I thought it was enjoyable.",What Women Want
80,roghache,"Cute, fun comedy romance, but not for young teens",7,16 March 2006,"This movie is a great, mindless way to spend a couple of hours. Plenty of comedy and a lovely romance, though I do have a couple of morality disclaimers for the younger crowd. The handsome Mel Gibson (sigh!) very deftly and humorously pulls off the role of the playboy jerk, and Helen Hunt, always a great leading lady, is convincing as his brainy colleague. The premise of this movie paints a picture of the inevitable comedy to follow. An egotistical, playboy advertising exec, Nick, suddenly through a fluke accident (pseudo electrocution), acquires the ability to read women's thoughts. Hilarity of course ensues, as this guy's a chauvinistic egotist who thinks he is God's gift to the female sex, for whom he has virtually zero respect. It's quite a wake-up call when he learns that women don't always have the stellar opinion of him he's always assumed. Meanwhile, he decides to use his newfound abilities to essentially steal advertising ideas from the brain of a smart colleague named Darcy, who has just gotten the promotion he himself had sought. However, he develops feelings for this woman he is so callously using...I admire Mel Gibson for the general decency of his movies, relative to the modern norm. Of course it's stereotypical Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus thinking, but some good basic messages (respect for women, paternal responsibility, and the general evils of using people) come through as loud and clear as the women's thoughts come to Nick. However, I do have a few morality qualms for younger viewers, having just read a comment to the effect that Nick has no problem when he intrudes into a scene with his bra-less 15 year old daughter and her 18 year old boyfriend. I don't recall (it's been awhile), but maybe I need to watch the movie again. One would hardly expect (or want) most dads to approve of that scenario. At least Nick does come to regret his woeful inattentiveness to his daughter, try to assume his fatherly obligations, and develop a genuine relationship with her. In fact, Nick starts out pretty despicable in general as a seductive womanizing worm, particularly the way he takes sexual advantage of a coffee shop waitress (Marissa Tomei), who has zero self esteem and is really flattered by his attention, then sleazily weasels his way out of a relationship, breaking her heart. (Incidentally, I didn't think the gay joke here added to the plot or the comedy.) Some commentator noted that the sex scene is vulgar for a PG-13 movie. Again, I don't recall, but maybe I'd better watch that one again, too. Also, Nick unfortunately doesn't come through with much genuine repentance for the way he's treated this poor girl. Can't make comedy out of it, I suppose, and need to use the film time to get on with the Darcy romance.Lots of laughs though...wait till you see Nick wearing his black pantyhose and dealing with hot waxing his legs! And of course, once he starts reading the ladies' thoughts, it's one hoot after another.The romance between the 'cad turned sensitive' and the 'vulnerable corporate executive' follows a not surprising but entertaining enough path. The chemistry between Nick and Darcy is fabulous. Nice dance scene, but I won't give the ending away.I agree with the reviewer who stated that the first half of the movie is mainly comedy and the second half romance. However, I don't class this as a chick flick. I admit that while I can't read MEN'S minds, I think they'll enjoy it as well. My own husband did. It's basically just an enjoyable, carefree movie, though I wouldn't recommend it for young teens due to some of the reasons mentioned.",What Women Want
81,trimmerb1234,Groundhog Day without wit,5,26 April 2008,"Watching this movie I was reminded of the plot similarities to Groundhog Day made 7 years earlier. Both have an oafish lead character who by means of a miracle gains an insight into others' thoughts and in the process becomes a transformed and better person. In fact What Women Want on the face of it has a stronger idea: the lead character can actually hear women's thoughts.But although these two movies at least at the concept stage are level-pegging it is the realisation in screenplay, casting and performance that make one a revered classic and the other a lead balloon. Bill Murray had a vehicle worthy of his great talents in Groundhog Day. Here though the match is of an entirely different kind: a pretty witless and clumsy script gets a pretty witless and clumsy rendering by Mel Gibson. Whereas Murray was subtle indeed deadpan yet unerringly accurate, Mel Gibson thrashes around wildly trying to raise a smile. The fact is that it is a role for a comedian or at least comic actor. Comedy's funniest moments are often moments of extreme seriousness - even slapstick at its most hilarious, as Laurel and Hardy showed, was when those involved appear to be in deepest earnest. The appearance by (an uncredited) Bette Midler - like Murray an accomplished stand-up comedian - gives things a welcome tremendous lift but this is only a brief light in the otherwise rather irritatingly wasted good idea the movie represents.",What Women Want
82,Mort-31,Groundhog Day II,7,3 August 2001,"I have a theory that the writers of What Women Want` were fans of the brilliant Harold Ramis film Groundhog Day`. Concerning their base ideas, these films have more in common than it seems. Supernatural things happen to both characters, Phil Connors and Nick Marshall, things that are actually never explained. First, they see their fate as a punishment, later they learn how to take advantage of it. In the end, the magic's over and they both got a woman. In one point, the similarity is most striking. They both have a peculiarity no other movie has: During watching, you're getting so terribly jealous of the main character that it's hard to get through the rest of the movie.I don't have to say that Groundhog Day` was there first, that its dialogues are brilliant and that the cynical tone of Bill Murray makes the movie enjoyable in every, really every single minute. What Women Want` is hilarious at the beginning but towards the end, it develops a sentimentality that is really displaced. I asked myself why they did that. It was not necessary; there would have been a number of possibilities to end the movie differently, without hurting the American happy-end tendency. And with the tone, also the sharpness of the jokes sinks and they become predictable.For Mel Gibson, of course, this movie is an absolute success. He was never so good, actually. And Helen Hunt is a jewel, no surprise. One thing disappointed me: If you consider that the director is a woman, you may rightly hope that, by watching her film, you finally find out what women want.

How did these three people with four Oscars among them end up in junk like this?  First of all, how do writers Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa know what women want?  Women are individuals and should be treated as such.  To make a generalization that they all want the same thing is ludicrous.  Mel Gibson plays a chauvinist in this film and a man who got to this position by being an overbearing jerk isn't about to get in touch with his feminine side just because he SUDDENLY cares what other people think.  To make things even more unpleasant, there are many amounts of typical office politics thrown into this film and while the politics of the advertising industry are right on target here, every scene involving it is directed the same and the wooden direction of Nancy Meyers is the worst thing here and there is no chemistry at all between Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.

The whole idea of becoming a better man by understanding women is pure myth and somewhat politically-correct. Individuals become better people from learning from other individuals- regardless of sex!(Spoiler: Alert) Mel Gibson's character, Nick, was way too sexist for a person who was raised solely by his mother- even if she was a flamingo dancer in Las Vegas! In the film, his values are extremely chauvinistic until he is electrocuted in the bathtub where he discovers he can read women's minds! He uses this power to extract ideas from Darcy (Helen Hunt), and explores his mind-reading abilities with his daughter (Ashley Johnson) and a coffee-shop attendant (Marisa Tomei). Nick soon learns that reading women's thoughts gives him the opportunity to improve his own character, as he eventually falls in love with Darcy and attempts to reconcile with his daughter.The premise is great and the 'battle-of-the-sexes' theme works considerably well in this film as certain characteristics of men and women are explored. Mel Gibson is utterly hilarious as the chauvinist Nick who explores his feminine side. There is a few great laughs within this film and a great dance by Gibson to Frank Sinatra. Helen Hunt was also very good, as was Marisa Tomei in her role (even though it was limited). There was a great cameo from Bette Midler, but unfortunately Alan Alda's character was wasted.'What Women Want' are very similar to films like 'Cleo/Leo', 'Tootsie' and 'Switch' where the basic plot is a 'man' explores the concept of women by becoming them- this time the 'man' can read women's thoughts! It's basically political-correct fun and probably a great date film! I must admit, I squirmed a couple of times thinking: is that really what they think? Unfortunately, 'What Women Want' drags on towards the end, and over-kills it's message slightly especially during the final act (which was my least favourite scene) which became almost too righteous and P.C.- but then again, I guess the irony was funny!'What Women Want' seems to forget that essentially women are individuals and each one of them thinks differently! Saying that, I enjoyed this film, especially Mel Gibson's performance and it's a nice romantic film that has a positive message, although slightly shallow- and they just needed to edit it a bit! Anyway the positives outweigh the negatives for 'What Women Want'- especially in the first two thirds! *** out of *****!",What Women Want
87,macpherr,"Good, but a somewhat too cliche!",7,17 May 2001,"Oscar winner director Mel Gibson (The  Year of Living Dangerously, Maverick) plays ""Nick Marshall"" a very likable guy in this movie. I still don't understand why nice looking guys have to direct to get Oscars.  Robert Redford (A River Runs Through It) had to do the same thing as well as many others.  I have not watched Mel in those Lethal Weapon movies, and thought that I did not know much about this a work, but actually I have several of Mel's movie in our movie library. An extremely handsome,  religious family man, Mel is among Hollywood s top role models. The guy has so many kids. I wonder where he finds the time to be so fit... I liked Nick because he used his new found gift in a sensible way. Nick felt that he had abused it but I thought he was a pretty okay mind reader. He became a much better person after he was stuck by a lightning.  My husband thinks he should have been able to keep the gift, just learn to control it.Oscar winner actress Helen Hunt (Mad about You, As God As It Gets) is always a pleasure to watch, and I am confident that I know her work. She looks extremely pretty in this movie. Even more than her normal natural beauty.
I like the music in this movie and the movie has rhythm. I love that! 
The cast is fabulous, a real audience grabber. I had no idea that all those famous people were there. Alan Alda (Jake's Women)  Beth Middler, Marisa Tomei, Lauren Holly, all those Oscar winner's!!!!!!! I guess no strugglling actor will do much with Icon Entertainment International and  Paramount who seem to only want to deal with the big guys. The producers, directors, music are all of the finest of the fine and this movie had everything to succeed. This was not a struggling independent  type movie. This is only for the cream of the crop. That I don't quite like, because I think the industry should always try to give chance to the new comers, but that is not true.The movie was very enjoyable, and we had fun watching. I will probably buy the tape and soundtrack. Who does not like Sinatra at his best?  Although I don't like to compare, I felt that ""Brigit Jones Diary"" was less pretentious but a much better over all movie. Not so cliche! Or is  Hollywood only after cliches!!!! Just wondering!!!Favorite scenes: Nick Marshall dancing and singing. That was really cool. Well the stair way case at the final scene reminded me too much of ""As Good As It Gets"" and with all this money and talent the last scene could be a little different. Overall this movie is a winner.Favorite Quotes:  Darcy McGuire: What kind of knight in shining armor would I be if the man I love needs rescuing and I just let him walk out my door?",What Women Want

90,Shiva-11,Braveheart has a funnybone!,8,17 December 2000,"What Women Want:  I was 20 years old when I learned a very valuable lesson. Darren - a friend of mine, who had been with his girlfriend (Cathy) for four years - came to my room sporting a huge grin and proudly announced that he had figured out women.  Not wanting to miss a revelation on par with the meaning of life, I listened intently as he explained that after having studied his girlfriend's responses to situations in the past, he realized that she always came back with one of three responses (I don't recall what they were).  He even went so far as to predict what her response would be to that evening's discussion.  Two hours later, Darren returned, crestfallen and confused - not only had Cathy not given the ""predetermined"" response, she came up with a brand new one!  His sad deflation only reaffirmed my belief that while men may hear what their partners are saying, they don't understand them (I too have been guilty of this) and vice versa, and we blindly muddle through most conversations and relationships without a clue.  I'm convinced that we've managed to propagate the species by pure fluke.Nick is a typical ""man's man"" who spends the bulk of his waking moments as an obnoxious, insensitive, sexist jerk.  His ego is dented when the plumb job of Creative Director is given to a woman, and he is determined to unseat her.  Nick's plans are temporarily detoured when he is electrocuted and awakes to find that he can hear what women think.  The question is, will his newfound gift be a bane or a boon? Men go to see Mel Gibson's movies for the action sequences, whereas women go to see Mel.  Unfortunately, other than his brief flashes of comedic flair in the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise, Gibson has never been given an opportunity to display his well-known wacky side onscreen (his practical jokes on set are legendary) - until now.  Gibson handles both subtle and slapstick comedy (the sequence where he is trying to come in touch with his feminine side left me clutching my sides) with mastery and you will laugh - a lot.  This latest performance has also drawn repeated comparisons to Carey Grant's suave style, not a compliment to be taken lightly.  Helen Hunt plays Darcy, Nick's nemesis (unknown to her however), a self-assured go-getter who actually speaks her mind, (an interesting twist given the premise of the film).  This honesty however has come at a price - her husband left her, she is referred to as a ""bitch on wheels"" and she is painfully lonely.  Hunt is careful to balance Darcy's power and pathos, elevating her above the glaringly stereotypical writing.  I enjoyed her and Gibson's chemistry, especially the awkwardness they exhibit whenever they have romantic scenes. The supporting cast - most notably Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine as Nick's vacuous assistants - adds to the overall silliness.One common thread I've read among the detractors of this film is that the characters are unrealistic (they're too extreme one way or the other) and the situations are contrived.  I definitely agree - if you are in search of a movie that gives an unflinching portrayal of the ongoing battle of the sexes, and male/female dynamics, put your wallet back in your pocket, this is not the movie for you.   If however you are in the mood for light-hearted entertainment and some laughs, buy your ticket.",What Women Want
91,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: All You Wanted in a Smart Romcom!!,7,3 June 2014,"What Women Want. An out of box idea where Nick played by charming Mel Gibson gets the miraculous ability to hear what women are thinking. As expected, this ability makes him women's favorite and helps him boost his career where he is directly competing with Darcy played by smart Helen Hunt who eventually becomes his love interest. The interesting idea evolves into a number of witty sequences where Nick manipulates the women around him by using their own thoughts and all these women fall for him instantly. The movie is nicely paced to give you enough time to absorb the idea. Pairing of Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt works in right manner where both make you root for them. Although movie seems to fail in exploiting the smart idea to its best of the potential but it still makes some nice moments. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for What Women Want. It will never blow your mind off but it makes for a nice watch anytime.",What Women Want

93,aramo1,Silly entertaining nonsense.,6,28 May 2002,"Based on R1 DVD 127 minThis is not destined to be a classic movie in the mould of Tracy & Hepburn [who?] - it lacks both wit and chemistry between Gibson and Hunter. Grumbles aside it is an entertaining diversion with some 'moments' - the smile on Mels face after being declared a 'sex god' is very good as is his solo dancing. Hunter has less to play with but does a professional job. The movie could do with a slight trim, at over two hours it overstays its welcome.On the 'what women think' angle - the Advil scene says it all - what ever they think they will not admit it either to themselves or to other women so who should care?",What Women Want
94,Benjamin_Cox,"A patronising, politically incorrect mis-mash - 60%",6,26 September 2007,"Something I'm often found to be saying is that if the great Albert Einstein couldn't figure out how the female mind worked then mere mortals like myself have no chance. However, I have my doubts that it rarely works as it does here in this modern update of your classic battle-of-the-sexes rom-com. However, before you find yourself reaching for the nearest remote or Van Damme rental, you might be inclined to persevere with this fairly middling effort. It might have a few snappy one-liners here and there but I frankly felt a little surprised that such an old-fashioned movie like this had been made. It felt stereotyped, deeply implausible and left a nasty taste in the mouth.Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a womanising advertising exec who considers himself the ultimate player. Over-looked for promotion by his boss (Alan Alda), Nick's day gets even worse when he finds himself now working under a high-powered female rival - Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) - and forced into focusing his energy on developing a campaign for women which he struggles to do. Then, after a freak hairdryer-in-the-bath accident (bear with me), he suddenly develops the ability to hear the thoughts of all women. Naturally, Nick decides to use this to his advantage and strives to get McGuire dropped as soon as possible but the more he hears her thoughts, the more attracted to her he becomes.Now, I realise that women are far and away the more complex half of the species but watching ""What Women Want"" was either a startling education into how shallow a lot of women are or grossly inaccurate. All women are either shameless flirts inside, emotionally crippled or vicious hard-nosed bitches ready with a snotty aside at a moment's notice, according to this film. Some mistake, surely. Gibson actually has very little to do besides swagger and strut - not exactly a stretch for Hollywood's favourite ladies man - but Hunt leads the disappointments among the other performers. But I don't blame them - there is only so much life you can breathe into a walking two dimensional stereotype and despite pretending that this is contemporary and ""new man"", this is actually about as politically correct as a Miss World contest. Even the gimmick of seeing Gibson in tights trying to wax his legs is hardly original - anyone not yet seen ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""? And yet, I still enjoyed ""What Women Want"" though it is hardly an Earth-shattering moment in movie history. Despite the lack of any respectable acting or consistent comedy, the story made me stick with it to see if it all came good in the end but by the time of the final credits, I realised that it had gone on for far too long. The premise is just about entertaining enough but again, I felt that it just wasn't explored enough. Once Gibson gets around to trying to trump his boss and sleep with the good-looking waitress at the local coffee joint (a wasted Marisa Tomei), it seems to run out of ideas. Trust me, I'm grateful that it isn't as bad as other gender-swap comedies I can think of (Rob Schneider being one of the few men in this world I would happily like to lock in a coffin full of cobras) but this isn't as riotous as it might have been. Pity - I'm sure Gibson's humiliation deserves a higher score than a 6.",What Women Want

I think this movie can be enjoyed equally by both genders, which makes it one of the best in its genre.I'm not a huge Mel Gibson fan, but he was really good in this one. Helen Hunt wasn't too bad, either.Unlike most romantic comedies (most of them are usually not really 'comedies') I've sat through, this one was actually funny... and entertaining. Most importantly, - it wasn't predictable or too cheesy.One thing I did NOT appreciate, was the fact that the theme of the movie was ""Nike"" -- the whole movie is basically an infomercial for the ""Nike"" merchandise. Luckily, it does not spoil the film, because it's got an otherwise solid plot, excellent acting, and well-written dialogue.This is the type of movie you'd want to own on DVD and re-watch periodically.",What Women Want
96,bob_bear,Metrosexual Mel Shows The Boys How It's Done,6,5 January 2006,"Setting the scene, Mel Gibson's character is introduced in a pointless flashback that sees his childhood self being raised in exceptional circumstances. Why? I would have thought that the idea behind the film is that most men don't listen to women - whatever their upbringing? So why make him exceptional? The film only really gets going once he's been ""gifted"" with the power to read womens' thoughts. Then it becomes interesting. Though I'd rather have seen Bruce Willis play the lead. He's more of a man's man than Mel ever will be. Helen Hunt is adequate. And the daughter was forgettable. (btw Why was it portrayed as unreasonable for the Mel character to get angry when he found his 15 year old daughter bra-less and canoodling with her 18 year old boyfriend when he walked in unexpectedly. Like ""Hey, Dad. That is like soooo uncool!"" No it's not - it's normal!) The film is a fairytale. A piece of fluff. And unlikely to change the planet as we know it so why worry.

However there was just 1 issue. Well yes, this is not the best rom com I've seen, and it suffers from the absurdity present in many rom coms. However, this one was especially glaring. For an absent father to only after what, 3 heartfelt moments, to be forgiven for not being there for his daughter's 15 years of life, that is just simply ridiculous a best. Besides, the people in the film are illogically forgiving?! It really made it a film leaving me wanting for greater substance.

A film like this should wrap in 100 minutes tops and leave us wanting more, not leave us checking our watches and yelling at the actors to get the ending already.Much like Castaway, another film where Hunt plays an unconvincing love interest, the final act of this film drags on and on and leaves you unsatisfied.All that said, a mild recommendation.

My favorite part of the movie is when he is trying out the ladies products and hop around a little trying to get into the pantyhose. Although this is a by the book type of film.

They think like little schoolgirls. If a man is not interested in women, but men instead (= if he's gay) he thinks and acts like a woman, because being gay means to be less of a man than heterosexual guys.

If this flick was supposed to be funny I didn't find anything to laugh at. And its premise that somehow Gibson acquires the quality of being able to read women's minds as a result of falling into a bathtub of water with a hair blower is so phony. In reality it would have killed him. Couldn't the writers find a better way of giving him this special quality? Then it he could read the minds of women, why couldn't he read every one's thoughts?But the upside of the movie is the fact that men and women think differently and men are usually insensitive to what women think. It is not always a purposeful insensitivity because it most of the time men just don't get it as hard as they try. I think most men would love to be more sensitive to women if they could figure them out but I can tell you that after over 50 years of trying I still cannot figure women out even though I am much better at it than when I was young. I honestly wish that when I was young I could have known what the women in life were thinking because it certainly would have made life more enjoyable. And I never was a male chauvinist. That is why I would recommend all men see this flick.One downside to the flick was Ashley Johnson who played Gibson's daughter Alex. She was badly cast as a sophomore.

It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise.

But good, don't get me wrong, I enjoy it immensely and have it in my collection, mainly due to the fact that Mel Gibson is a male actor I made into a surrogate Dad when I was younger, so I always enjoy watching him (much better actor than he is a director, but that's arguable i guess, anyway he's too religiously weird for me to like his ""serious"" directorial efforts.This is another film I happily watch just for it's ""feel"" - it's bright, airy and relaxed. The fake-looking backdrops in Mel's apartment while he's spinning in the bowler hat to Frank Sinatra just add to the film's charm, not detract from it. The one prob I have is that, okay, look, we're supposed to see Mel change from this chauvinistic pig into a sensitive guy, yet he TRAMPLES over Marisa Tomei's character, excusing himself as ""gay"" to her face while he goes and f*cks Helen Hunt's character? I'm a guy, but even I thought this was a b*stardly thing to do to someone. And Marisa Tomei? My god...this is just my opinion but if I had to decide between her (they obviously had great sex, and Marisa Tomei is gorgeous - I'd quite literally kill to get her naked for 40 minutes...the RIGHT 40 minutes) and straight-laced, probably-never-moans Darcy (Helen Hunt) I'd be jamming on into Marisa's bed without a moment's hesitation... That's not to say anything about Helen Hunt's talents...far from it, I think she's a terrific and original actress who isn't in enough movies...and she IS gorgeous too, I just can't past Marisa...anyway, enough of my boyhood fan-crushes (I'm sure you're all REAL interested in who I think is H - O - T lol) This film gives a nod to older romantic comedies from the 40's and 50's, and in a lot of ways it reminds me of those films (the ones I've seen anyway) in that it has a ridiculously far-fetched plot (he gets electrocuted by a hairdryer and then can suddenly read women's minds...) that somehow just seems plausible because the rest of the movie is so silly and fun. Take Bringing Up Baby with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn...perfect example of this.So many movies seem to fall apart by the end and this is no exception. The ending is extremely predictable and emotionally FLAT...I quite literally couldn't care less who ends up with who...they're all attractive people I'm sure they'll do fine lol...but c'mon inject a bit of originally (or failing that, at least some humour) into the ending of the film...it's the final shot that stays with people, and Mel and Helen huggin on the stairs didn't really burn itself into my memory...Mel Gibson/Helen Hunt fans: dig in, you will enjoy this! If you don't like Mel, or can't stand predictable romantic-comedies...steer clear! Oh, definite date movie, just keep the Marisa Tomei comments and drooling to a minimum, or that couch is gonna be where you spend the night! Take care people, TTT.",What Women Want
116,miro-6,what women should not want...,2,27 December 2000,"...is to watch a movie like that. Every stupid banality is in this stupid movie. When it tries to be fun it is pathetic. When it tries to be romantic it is just boring. When it tries to send a message it is obvious. It sends us back to the 50's where people of soap operas are glued from ever. Also the notorious Notting hill looks like an intellectual and underground movie in front of this jurassic way to make a show. Unfortunately a lot of those old fashion and fatuous movies has been made during the last 2 years. I try to make a list: Runaway bride- Notting hill- Return to me- The next best thing- Message in the bottle- If you did not like those movies, don't go to see this last one. If you did, you have to go...you deserve it. But if you are a person over 12, Q.I. over 50, and you work to find your money,save it. I was forgetting the music.

I moved forward quite a bit, still drivel, and the guy who was I assume going to do some mind reading hadn't yet it seemed learned how and also he was a complete anodyne bore so far. The ""conversation"" and general events were mindless boring too - nothing much at all was happening.I flipped on once more to way into the movie. Still no sign of mind reading or any action of any interesting kind and the boring so-called mind-reader was still on the screen apparently doing nothing much still. So when does he manage the mind-reading which was the only reason I recorded the movie, ie hoping for some laughs? I'd had enough of the uncharismatic ""hero"" Was he Mel Gibson? If so, no wonder. I never noticed until this website for my comment that Gibson was in the movie. If I'd realised I wouldn't have wasted my time recording it, as I can't abide Gibson. I didn't recognise him.I didn't even bother to watch the ending which I usually do with movies I record that are too boring to keep watching.",What Women Want
121,jehaccess6,Film Viewpoint - Men Gain Virtue As They Become More Feminine In Outlook.,6,13 September 2008,"The Mel Gibson character Nick Marshall was the son of a Las Vegas showgirl . He grew up hanging around with the showgirls backstage instead of normal boyhood activities. He had no father, just a succession of his mother's paramours. In such a deprived environment, he latched onto Frank Sinatra as his male role model. In moments of stress from females, he turned to his estrogen antidote : Frank.Growing up around women, Nick soon learned how to manipulate them to his advantage. He could put on a false front that would appeal to just about any woman he set his sights on. Nick was all about the conquest not about establishing a relationship with a woman. He married a beautiful woman named Gigi and fathered a daughter Alexandra, but soon tired of a marriage that interfered with his opportunities to attract new women. As a boy, Nick needed a strong father to learn how to be a man; instead he became a shallow mockery of what a man should be.Nick prowls around a coffee shop near his office every morning before work. We see him spot an attractive young woman carrying a tray of coffee cups and deliberately collide with her to allow him to break the ice and begin a relationship.The Marissa Tomei character Lola works behind the counter at the coffee shop. She aspires to become an actress, but realizes that she has little chance of success and is mostly resigned to her fate. Nick hits on Lola every time he comes into the shop. Lola feels an attraction to Nick but she is wise enough to realize that getting involved with him is a recipe for disaster.Then Nick suffers a near electrocution in his bathtub and acquires the ability to read the female mind. He turns this ability to evil ends and seduces Lola by anticipating all her needs and soothing all her well-justified fears. Marissa Tomei really brought the Lola character to life. She was a struggling young woman who needed a man to fill the emptiness in her life, not clutch the viper Nick to her bosom. I really despised the Nick character for his ruthless exploitation of Lola.Nick is hoping for a big promotion at his advertising agency, but is passed over for a woman, the Helen Hunt character Darcy Mc Guire. He uses his ability to read minds to steal Darcy's creative ideas and interfere with her ability to manage her department. Nick never stops to consider that if Darcy is dismissed, he will never have her creative ability on tap to cover his deficiencies in that department.The Nick character is already very advanced in his understanding of women. He can read a lot about them from body language and their actions. When he gains direct access to their thoughts, they are putty in his hands. Somewhat unconvincingly, Nick starts to develop a conscience when he realizes how many women despise him.The women in this film are all portrayed as noble characters. There are some really nasty women out there in the business world. Not every woman who advances does so on sheer ability. Advertising is savagely competitive and to rise to the top sometimes requires stepping on a few bodies who get in the way.There was some chemistry between Nick and Darcy in this film. Darcy really never realized how unsavory was Nick's past. In real life, some of the women at the ad agency would have filled Darcy in on some of Nick's exploits with his women coworkers. Darcy should have been wise enough to ask around when she started to feel an attraction to Nick.In short, the film is amusing and uplifting if you watch it without thinking too deeply about the plot.",What Women Want

123,pleiades10,"Great premise, but falls flat.",6,1 January 2001,"Mel Gibson plays a chauvinistic ad exec who finds himself suddenly able to hear women's inner thoughts. Helen Hunt is the woman who beat him out for a promotion, hence Mel befriends her to steal her best ideas out of her mind and pass them off as his own. As the plot progresses, Gibson begins to feel guilty over his idea theft, plus, he starts to fall for Hunt, even as she is falling for him. The premise is good, and Gibson appears to really enjoy his role. The ""inner thoughts"", especially of his daughter (played by Ashley Johnson), and of coffee house employee Lola (the always delightful Marisa Tomei) are a laugh riot. Of course, we all know that the movie will take more of a serious tone once Mel's conscience starts to bug him. But the ending wraps everything up so abruptly, that you sit and stare at the ending credits in disbelief! It really seems that there should have been another 10 minutes or so between Gibson and Hunt that ended up being compressed into the last 60 seconds.
Several decent subplots float around as well such as as Johnson's preparation in going to her prom with a much older guy, Tomei's internal reluctance to be hurt again, and Judy Greer's role of Erin, a quiet coworker of Gibson's that is contemplating suicide. It's also nice to see Alan Alda and Bette Midler in unexpected cameo roles.It's a funny film with good acting, but the insultingly goofy explanation for HOW Mel obtains his powers, and the unlikely romance between Gibson and Hunt, coupled with that abrupt ending, makes the movie fall flat in my eyes.",What Women Want

You have a few laughs about Gibson's behavior etc etc. But after an hour or so you start wondering where the speedy entrance went. The story slows down to a crawl and leaves you, the audience, looking at you nails out of boredom.When is Hunt going to play another role than this. She seems to be stuck here, and I believe she can do so much better. Tomei was fabulous but as always she gets the small role in the backseat. Gibson is hilarious in the first half, but then drops into this melodramatic ""what am I doing"" routine. If he was a real ""man's man"" he would not have doubted his actions.Two hours was way too long. A lot of the storylines could have been handled way faster or left hanging completely, we wouldn't have cared.

125,tripper0,just horrible.....,1,25 July 2001,"I have nothing nice to say about What Women Want.  I thought the movie was tasteless.  It was humourless.  It was boring, it was long, it wasn't clever, and never was it ever interesting.  Gibson may have been at his all time worst here.  Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson have as much chemistry as oil and water.  The main character was manipulative and not worth any sympathy ever.  When he got struck by lightning he should have died.  At least that would have made the movie shorter.  I really hold the female gender in fairly high regard, but if this is what passes for romance to women, and men for that matter, I have lost respect for almost everybody.  And really, the last scene between Hunt and Gibson was a huge cliche.  Helen Hunts character should have kicked him to the curb after all the s**t he did to her. Instead she plays the heroine.  Just horrible.  Nothing in this movie was remotely half decent, except for the fact that I never ever have to sit through it ever again in my life.  And I won't.  A big fat ZERO out of ten.

Mel Gibson is no Cary Grant and puts in an embarrassing performance - maybe the only person who could have pulled this off would have been Steve Martin - at least he is FUNNY.This film is supposed to be a comedy and I think I can remember smiling about twice whilst watching it - if you want to see original humour definitely give this film a miss - you'll have seen many of these jokes before. However the worst thing about this whole film is its message - what women want seems to say that they all want a man to look after them - be it as a father or partner and that they are incomplete without one - come on give me a break!!! The women are portrayed as pathetic in this film - they don't have an ounce of intelligence between them and don't come up with one interesting or intelligent thought.

135,j_graves68,"""...then you speak Venutian !",6,19 August 2005,"""What Women Want"" is one of the few feminist but male-friendly romantic comedies that have some soul whilst making an uncompromising laugh out of both of the sexes. It never seems to take itself real seriously (and I think that's because the writers knew that they couldn't come up with a more interesting/original twist with how Mel acquires his secret power). Nevertheless, a guy could really learn a thing or two about how women think after watching this. It's not the gospel, but there's a little room for tact in every man, and this movie delivers it while entertaining you at the same time.Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a CEO of a Chicago advertising firm and a pompous, arrogant, superficial, Frank Sinatra-loving playboy/bachelor/jerk at the same time. He is accidentally electrocuted when ""sampling"" some complementary women's products only to be able to hear the mind's voices of what every woman is thinking when he comes to. He's terrified at first, but after seeing his shrink (a cameo from Bette Midler), he embraces his new power. It helps him compete in his job with rival Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) as well as construct a relationship with his estranged daughter (Ashley Johnson), and land the cute aspiring actress-turned coffee shop barista Marisa Tomei, into bed.The film is light and funny throughout, but begins not to know what to do with itself within the final twenty minutes. Basically the first half is cute, but then it seems to get over-sentimental and sappy. The love theme between Gibson and Hunt works off their chemistry, but it is also a tired and contrived requisite in today's romantic comedies. I love the stumbling in the park and the different thoughts to every female (along with the poodle and her French accent). And the scene where Mel and Marisa are going to get it on is a hoot. I love his mannerisms when he tells Marisa later that he's gay. Little touches like this also include Mel imitating Sean Connery's way of saying ""adversary"" when channel surfing. And later, Gibson sobs while watching Richard Simmons. And I know Mel had to be the sensitive, caring, good ole dad to his rather unattractive daughter (I just don't buy that Gibson and Lauren Holly could have a kid that ugly), but that's when the story began to derail.There are many rising stars who have gone on to other projects since, like bits parts from Mark Feuerstein, Sarah Paulson, Judy Greer, Lisa Edelstein, Loretta Devine and others. Former TV army surgeon Hawkeye Pierce even has a few scenes that really anyone in his age bracket really could of played.Since watching this though, I learned a few do's and don't's to say to women (this was one of the first movies my girlfriend-now-wife and I watched together). And to know that women are about as neurotic as men is comforting thanks to this film. Like I said, this is a great date movie as well as one of those gems you always leave in your DVD collection when there's nothing on cable one night.I would of given it a higher rating if its ending was as original as its beginning.

Now, this movie is  a bad movie because the storyline is dumb, although someone may say it was original, but it was still dull and boring. The acting was horrible, especially by Gibson.  Mel has to make some kind of a better body language motion in the movie than just swallowing after being scared.  Helen Hunt was horrible, and the only movie I like of hers is this old series, but I forgot the name.  The directing is simply the worst and thank god Gibson didn't try to direct this movie.

It turned out to be better than what I expected, but still no better than a 6.Gibson is fine, Hunt is fine, Alda is fine, everybody's fine. Some of the jokes are cute-funny, and even though I grow weary of stereotyped jokes about gender differences, WWW escaped my complete wrath by at least looking at these issues with a modicum of sensitivity and respect.
The plot is completely predictable, the elements are formulaic, and there is nothing extraordinary about the movie. Those attracted to Gibson will love the scene specifically designed for those attracted to Gibson, where he dances to Frank Sinatra and plays with a hat. It is unbelievably contrived, but since he does a pretty good job acting sexy, it goes off without too much of a hitch. I could imagine the women of the theatre swooning and thinking to themselves, ""That's what I want!"" Ah, the bean counters in Hollywood must have been smiling big smiles...At least the movie doesn't really try to answer the question of what women want. Even though the movie seems to suggest at times that women want someone who can read their mind, it becomes obvious that what is really sexy and desirable is just having men actually listen to them and not be obnoxious jerks whose idea of gender equality is patting both cheeks of the ass. And that's if they even want to bother with men at all--most of what is going on in their minds, according to the movie, is the same as in mens': Work, family, health, paying bills, trying to look good, just getting by in life. It's not really profound, but maybe it needed saying.All in all, the movie is pretty average stuff.

It could have been ""comic gold"" if the concept were in the right hands, but sadly this was not the case. The movie was too long. The beginning was fast-paced and humorous, but in Act 2 it became slow, tedious and predictable. The end is also completely and totally predictable. This is all quite unfortunate because the premise is great. The ""mind-reading"" scenes were too few. This was supposed to be the core idea of the movie. Therefore, we shouldn't just have a small smattering of ""mind-reading scenes"". This should have been a stronger element. If this movie was made by Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, something truly great and hilarious might have been produced, but this turned out to be a big, sappy, gooey mess. Gibson shows us he can dance. That was a plus. The movie also looked good and had a few decent editing sequences (the scene where he gets electrocuted, for example). However, it does feel (by the end) rather superficial and empty. It could have been an intriguing dissection of gender and gender differences, but it ends up presenting men and women in black and white terms. There were a few nice scenes. The movie wasn't all bad (which is why I gave it five instead of one). The scene where Mel breaks down while watching a woman being emotional on TV, for example... or dancing like Fred Astaire. It was also nice to see the toddler from Growing Pains all grown up (and actually acting quite well!). Overall, I would have to suggest avoiding this one. It's exhausting. If they cut out half an hour, cut down on the subplots, made the film much funnier and if it wasn't so predictable and ""Hollywoody"" this could have been something special.

Mel Gibson is the star of action movies terrific showed himself in comedian role, proving what he can laugh at himself too. Charming Helen Hunt make perfect portrait of modern woman who is active, confident in herself, independent but as well she is vulnerable, touching and tender in her inner world. In that film there are many beautiful women as Bette Midler, Marisa Tomei, Lauren Holly, Judy Greer, Sarah Paulson, Lisa Edelstein and therefore for me ""What Women Want"" like a feast.",What Women Want
145,Ron-18,Shallow and cartoonish....entertaining as a comic strip,6,30 December 2000,"No depth, gratuitious mugging by Mel Gibson, and a cardboard cutout plot made this a disappointment.  An obvious throwaway plot vehicle for Gibson, this movie reinforces my fear that he has sold out completely to the Hollywood junk machine.  He now has become an ingredient, much as corn syrup is to bubble gum. He is also about as memorable.  Helen Hunt is starting to spread herself too thin.  She also needs to pick her movies more carefully. It is not too late for her.  She has not reached the corn syrup stage, as yet.  A shallow, disappointing piece of lint.",What Women Want
146,strangie,Don't expect ground breaking insights in this pleasant film,7,9 January 2001,"Ok ... so I'd read the reviews and wasn't expecting a great deal (although why people were looking to a movie, a comedy no less, for answers to the age old question ""what do women want?"" was a little beyond my comprehension). Perhaps the two down falls of this film is that is a fraction overlong and there are a few too many sub-plots running.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find not a bad film!So, Nick, played by Mel Gibson, is a chauvinistic male pig who has little regard for anyone but himself, is a greatly flawed man, had a showgirl mum and women who waited on him hand and foot and didn't have a decent male role model (save for loan sharks and shysters).  In walks Darcy, played by Helen Hunt, who is apparently a man-eating ball breaker and has also taken the job that Nick had himself earmarked for.  The ""ball breaking"" Darcy is never revealed, but a soft, unsure but apparently in-control one is. Nick then has an accident and finds that he is able to hear what women are thinking.It doesn't really take a rocket scientist to figure out what's going to happen in the end, but there are some nice surprises along the way.  Marisa Tomei does a excellent job, given the limited role of her character Lola (although I was a little miffed regarding the treatment of her character - see above, too many sub-plots).  A marvelously hilarious cameo by Bette Midler, was a highlight for me.",What Women Want
147,jwbeller,Extremely enjoyable two hours at the movies,9,20 December 2000,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  It contained a number of very funny moments as well as touching ones.  This is a feel good movie in the same vein as Bounce and As Good As It Gets.  Mel Gibson is as natural for his part as Helen Hunt is for hers.  The writing is also extremely good. It's just pure fun.,What Women Want

So i decided to give the film a shot this time and i was pleasantly surprised.A couple things to point out. He didn't even try to hide the fact he could read minds, legit answering their thoughts all the time which would get suspicious over time, espicially with how he stole her ideas, over and over again. Pointing out problems in the work she just thought of and was about to say.The movie felt a tad long to me probably because of how direct mel gibson was throughout. Plus it was a longer runtime which definitely could've been cut short but the way it ended felt like they wrapped it all up to quick.That being said the film did leave you invested in some of the characters and stayed funny throughout. .",What Women Want
149,jeffchan,An unexpectedly good and entertaining film,9,10 May 2001,"What Women Want is a pleasant surprise.  It's clever, funny, interesting, and it's well written, acted and crafted.  Mel Gibson, newcomer Ashley Johnson playing Mel's daughter, and Helen Hunt give strong performances. Hunt is largely the straight person so her role is more static than others, but she plays it nicely.  The dialogue and chemistry between Gibson and Hunt brings to mind some of filmdom's best duos such as Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Bacall, and the film's lighthearted spirit likewise reminds me of Hollywood's Golden Age.  The plot device of Gibson gaining sudden insight into womens' true thoughts is certainly no more or less hokey than situations Tracy and Hepburn found themselves in.  The soundtrack which includes snippets from Sinatra, Christina Aguilera, Meredith Brooks, B*Witched, original compositions by Alan Silvestri is diverse and tastefully effective -- it makes a cool movie cooler.Gibson's charm is really beguiling this time.  His acting is tops and Ashley Johnson is impressive too.  Johnson does not fit the Hollywood mold, yet she plays the intricacies of her part wonderfully.  The rest of the cast is strong too.  I liked Mel in the Mad Max series, The Patriot, Braveheart, Payback and other gory, violent action flicks (other than the awful Lethal Weapon series), so What Women Want along with his gentler films proves Mel can play vulnerable and sensitive just as well as mean and nasty.  Perhaps solid films like this will let us see more great performances from this very talented, obviously dedicated but critically underappreciated actor.Somewhat of a chick flick, but guys should be amused and may pick up something new.  Definitely one of the better movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years.",What Women Want

I liked the concept of it and that's pretty much it. It was badly written, even I thought of better stuff that would work better instead of what we got. Somethings didn't make sense, but i guess that falls under the umbrella of it being badly written, but what else do you need to hate a movie- not that I'm saying i hated it but i think i would've been just fine having spent my time doing something else.Basically, unless you desperately want a movie to watch and you've seen every good one out there, then i can't think of a reason why you shouldn't.

151,notlehs,What a man wants...to like this movie.,5,21 December 2000,"I am a 28 year old man.  I wanted to like this movie.  I love Mel Gibson.  I love Helen Hunt.  I liked the premise.  I liked 80% of the movie.  But.... 
There were some major plot problems in what could have, with just a little tweak here and there, been a darned fine movie.  My biggest problem is in the way the end was fashioned.  
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!Why would Mel Gibson's character say he stole all the ideas from her, when he didn't?  He stole parts from her, and parts from every other woman whose thoughts he was hearing.  He came up with the Nike concept and at best all she did was come up with part of the punch line.  They never really established that he actually really sabotaged much.  Why would she fire him?  That part MADE NO SENSE!  He wouldn't have said he stole the ideas, because she would buy that. There was nothing to steal!  He came up with the idea and they finished it together.  Now he did seem to steal the VISA ad, but that was such a small little piece in comparison to saying the NIKE ad was hers.  Since he wouldn't have said that, and he couldn't try and explain that he could read women's thoughts but the ability has suddenly left him, he would have to take the she was the other part of the team route.  I just don't see a reason to fire him.  The movie just fell into little bitty smoldering pile of rubbish at the end.
END SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!
Other than the ending, I thought the movie was funny, creative, and very good.  All but the last 10 minutes gets a 8/10 and the last 10 minutes gets a 2.  Which brings the overall score to 5/10.  Average.",What Women Want
152,stevenleadbetter,Title says it all.,5,10 November 2001,"As with Bridget Jones's Diary', this isn't a chick flick. A fair few chaps I know had been put off both movies from what they'd heard from women that they knew. Bridget Jones became empowered and in this offering we see an already empowered woman who is also vulnerable, as are most women in this picture, to Mel Gibson's mind-reading prowess. It only works on women, by the way. True, it is a moralistic tale, no matter how it may try to hide it. Gibson's character had been brought up in Vegas and his mother was a showgirl. As the film states, very early on, this is no the ideal upbringing for the feministic male. Not surprisingly then that he turns out to be as close to a gigolo as you can get without actually breaking the law. A serial abuser of women in relationships, he discovers his new boss is indeed a woman and his first thought on hearing the news is that she must be a hard-faced bitch. Suffice to say that he is proved wrong by the end of the picture as it desperately tries to educate men that there is more to women than what underwear they are wearing. It makes its point subtly and with feeling. Gibson's character, with this insight of being able to read into the minds of women everywhere suddenly gains new perspective on the people around him and subsequently, we are led to believe, becomes a better person for it. He doesn't, however, go slightly bonkers, as would seem far more realistic and appropriate. This movie is as harmless as it is thoughtless. This is a poke in the eye for men everywhere who are threatened by their female boss, their partners that earn more money than they do. In fact, it represents women in a very good light. Men, alternatively, do not come off so well. Men could do worse than to watch this movie and see what they may be missing. The more astute men amongst us are already aware of what we are missing and we have our heads down, hoping it will pass us by without spotting us, cowering in the corner. Both Hunt and Gibson are very good at this relationship stuff and they work very well together, the Casting Director can feel suitably chuffed at a job well done. I watched this film without prompting of any kind, from any woman. Does this mean I am a well-rounded new man? Nope, I fancy Helen Hunt, so I would have watched it anyway, never mind the content. Ouch, smacks of male chauvinism there, I think. If they'd cast an ugly old boot to play Hunt's role, would it have been so successful? Would the message have been lost for the sake of the right pretty face'. It's an admirable attempt at making a perfectly legitimate point, but falls at the first hurdle. That being, it is easier to be a successful businesswoman if you are also gorgeous to boot. Men will endure more hardship if they can get into bed with a beautiful woman, no matter how bright, funny or good at her job she is. It's a sad fact of life, however, that if you don't look as good as Helen Hunt, you may find your man is not always as patient.",What Women Want
153,vkap-13252,OK comedy; usual feminist drivel added,6,23 July 2017,"It is a reasonable comedy with Mel Gibson serving as the primary eye candy for women. Fair enough. His character is show as pretty much pathetic and various women as his victims: ex-wife, daughter, house-keeper, subordinate, date, boss - all of them.

WHAT WOMEN WANT is the smartest, most delightful romantic comedy to come out since last year's NOTTING HILL.  Gibson is brilliant.  He is more than capable of playing light and frothy. In the tradition of a Cary Grant, I think Gibson will be able to play romantic leads long after his action hero days are over.This film has a smart, tight screenplay with wonderfully drawn believable characters. The stellar supporting cast including Helen Hunt, who seems to be everywhere this year, is well worth the ticket price.If you see one film this holiday season, see this one.",What Women Want

What rescues this film from total oblivion:  the obvious fun that Gibson had with the role (particularly the Kelly-like dance sequence) and the performance of Hunt, which was typically nuanced far beyond the demands of the script.

156,Theoron,What Women Want is Mel Gibson tending to their every need...,7,27 July 2002,"Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a gay (as in ""happy"") divorcee having a wonderful time seducing women and creating very successful T&A themed advertising campaigns.   Nick is not an evil man, just your typical selfish bore with drop-dead good looks.   Though never overtly stated, Nick sees woman as a means of entertainment, like a TV or a video game.  He does not really care what they want nor what they think, as long as he gets what he wants from them: sexual fullfillment.  But life in the 21st century demands that one finally realize that women are much more than just playthings, and any advertising agency that does not understand how to market to women is going to find itself a third-rate institution.   So Nick's boss (Alan Alda) decides it's time to hire a female creative director to help land some of those lucrative ad campaigns for women's products.  Nick thought the position was all but his, so he's just a bit upset at that a strong, high-self esteem, alpha-female by the name of Darcy McGuire (Helen Hunt) is brought in to help them find out what women really want.  Nick quickly decides he will do what he can to make himself look good at Darcy's expense.But an interesting thing happens while Nick spends an evening trying to understand why women wax their legs: he gets electrocuted by his blow dryer, and the resulting damage leaves him with the ability to read a woman's mind as if she's actually talking to him.  At first he thinks he's going insane, but soon comes to the realization, with the help of his former marriage counselor (Bette Midler), the that he's been granted a very special gift.Nick is a guy who's been around woman his entire life, but has never really cared to understand them.  As long as he gets what he wants, why should he even care?  But now, thanks to his special ""gift,"" Nick gets to ""listen"" to what women really like and dislike, even if they refuse to admit it to anyone else, let alone themselves! As you can imagine, with a setup like this there has to be some laughs, and ""What Women Want"" delivers them by the bucketful.  Director Nancy Meyers pays great homage to those great old goofy comedies of the late 30's through early 60's that showcased clever dialogue and outrageous predicaments.  A knowledgeable student of cinema can see that Meyers has grabbed some of her inspiration from ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) all the way to the original ""Parent Trap"" (1961), as well as many other fine films from that period. 
Yet the greatest gift Meyers gives us in the casting of Helen Hunt as creative director who torments, then enthralls Mel Gibson.  As far as I'm concerned, anytime Helen Hunt is in a film, they should just take the Oscar for best performance, pack in a box and send it to her.  I remember with great fondness and surprise when I saw her on the big screen in the 1996 film ""Twister.""   For a goofy special effects extravaganza, Helen Hunt, playing the role of a meteorologist/storm chaser, gives a powerful and serious performance that even upstaged the tornadoes.  In ""What Woman Want,"" Helen again demonstrates why she is the most talented actress to ever come out of Hollywood.  That's quite a statement to make, but I can't think of any American actress who is even close to her equal, with the exception of Meryl Steep.  No, that wasn't Helen I saw on the screen, it really was a woman creative director newly hired at one of Chicago's high-powered advertising agencies.  She just looked like Helen...As for Mel's performance, he pretty much gets to play himself!  That's not a bad thing, and it's about time we see Mr. Gibson take part in a pure comedy. He over does it a bit, (as he usually does) but has enough charm and warmth that we can almost excuse the over-acting.  (Where's Cary Grant when you need him?)  Not surprisingly, his best scenes were with Helen Hunt.  There was enough chemistry between the two of them to keep DuPont in business for the next several years.The idea of a man being ""forced"" to listen to the needs and problems that women face (whether he wants to or not!) is an extremely clever comedic device, but also showcases a simple problem with people in general, both men and women: the inability to listen.  The art of listening, not just to what someone is saying, but WHY they are saying it, has been all but lost on a great many of us.  It's a rather simple skill that if it were to be seriously sought out, would bring joy and satisfaction to a great many very sad and miserable souls. ""What Women Want"" shows how the very simple act of ""listening"" can be a surprisingly transforming experience.  You don't have to be a mind reader, if someone knows you are truly listening to them, they'll speak their mind very clearly.My rating: 7/10",What Women Want

Helen Hunt is wonderful and her performance is worth just seeing the movie. She has moved into the league of great actresses and can on her sheer beauty and ability carry a movie. The story is cheesy at first and this could be in part blamed on Mel Gibson's overacting, but he may have been pushing it to get the point across about his characters personality. I found it funny that his two assistants minds couldn't be read as they didn't think. There's several little subplots that somewhat resolve themselves at the end, but this does not damage the movie too much and the ending is somewhat sweet.

But eventually (around the part I mentioned) I realized that it's very funny. And you've gotta love the romance!Mel Gibson is Nick Marshall, a womanizer who at the same time doesn't understand women at all. When the womanliest of all women, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), starts to work with his company, she assigns everyone to think of advertising ideas for at least one feminine item in the boxes she gives them (pantyhose, lipstick, mascara, a wonderbra, nail polish, etc.). Nick tries to think, but instead gets drunk and paints his nails, tries on the mascara and pantyhose, and yes, waxes his legs. That night, a freak accident occurs in his apartment, and then he can hear what women are thinking. He uses this asset to steal Darcy's ideas, and at the same time falls in love with her.Besides Gibson and Hunt's performances, there are three other reasons I love this movie. One, Marisa Tomei, who is perky and cute as Nick's previous uninterested love interest, a coffee-shop girl named Lola. But just when Nick gets less desperate for her and more so for Darcy, Lola discovers that she really does like him. Two, Ashley Johnson, who is demanding but lovable as Nick's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. He can hear her thoughts, too, and finds out that she's planning to lose her virginity on prom night. Although he tries to stop her, she eventually learns the lesson on her own. Three, it has an awesome soundtrack. Frank Sinatra, the Temptations, Nancy Wilson, and Bobby Darin sing old classics, while Christina Agulera and Meredith Brooks perform fairly new hits.Anybody who likes comedy, romance, or just a great movie should see ""What Women Want.""

Meanwhile, audiences find themselves able to read plot holes and poor screen writing after being enlightened by this film.Mel Gibson does a decent job in the role, although maybe that's because he's good at being a misogynistic douchebag in real life. In the film, he steps into a stew of women products conducted from his bathtub and gains the ability to read women's thoughts. And what do women think of? Complex thoughts involving life, their emotions and feelings, and/or their roles in society? Nope! Instead, women only think about dieting, being skinny, looking pretty, and smelling pretty. The women are also portrayed as schizophrenic, though this is entirely, 100% the fault of an awful director. It shows that women don't want to be loved, as Mel get's accused of being gay for ""being perfectly in tune"" with the woman he's dating. Yah, I totally believe woman would hate being cared for. Whenever a woman has a thought tantrum, her thoughts match that of her body movements. If she's screaming in her head, she's screaming with her body too. In one scene, Hellen Hunt accidentally stares at Mel's penis, resulting in her making these over-the-top body language movements. We as the audience can hear her thoughts, but in reality, it would be dead silent while she jumps back and fourth spinning around. This happens at least ten times in this movie.The film is abysmal, as proved by its ending, where Hunt fires Gibson but still wants to have coitus with him...and the movie just stops.

What Women Want is pure fluff with Mel Gibson doing his best to hold it together, and does a fairly decent job of it. Helen Hunt is her usual dry, unapealing, self, and no supporting characters of any interest except Marisa Tomei who's character is the only one with any real emotion. I could picture the writer pitching this story to a movie exec in 30 words or less, ""Mel Gibson's a chauvanist pig, and suddenly is able to read womens minds. Hilarity ensues, and at the end of the movie Mel's character is an incredibly sensitive man."" To me, the movie would've been much better if the chauvanist pig, became an even bigger pig as the movie went on. How could someone spends 40+ years being a chauvanist, and become Phil Donahue after only a week of reading women's minds? I don't get it. It's a one gag stream throughout the entire movie and never takes a chance. Personally, I would be trying to figure out any and every way I could make money off of my new-found talent, not figure out my new female boss' advertising ideas to steal.

All in all, WWW hits on all cylinders and holds up to repeat viewings as I have caught it many times on cable and no mater where it is in the movie I enjoy it. I know many people have an opinion about Mel as a person but in his acting roles he shines!

175,rbatty-3,"Funny, but shallow",6,17 December 2000,"This was one of the better efforts at romantic comedy in recent years (but don't get the impression you'll walk out of this movie knowing `www' because women's thoughts in this movie ARE pretty superficial).Mel Gibson was excellent.  The comic side that he displays in his action movies works well.  He plays a believable sexist and does a good job segueing from Mr. Pig to Mr. Sensitivity as he learns `what women want' (even though part of that segue - an affair with a coffee shop waitress, Marisa Tomei, which is helped by his supernatural power of hearing women's thoughts - goes against the grain of his mid-movie conversion). Mel's effort at repairing a damaged relationship with his 15-year old daughter, however, is a fine addition.  As the father of a 15-yr old girl, I can relate.Most of the women in this film are two-dimensional (although the roles of Gibson's two secretaries are a scream BECAUSE of their air-headedness), but you need to remember that this movie is about Mel Gibson, not Helen Hunt.  Hunt is ok, but her role is shallow.  Alan Alda (my, is he getting old!) hires Hunt because she's a shark, but she turns into a pussycat.  And there simply is no chemistry between Hunt & and Gibson.  They come nowhere close to matching the George Clooney-Michele Pfeiffer chemistry in `One Fine Day.'Lots of laughs; great soundtrack: 8 of 10 stars.Now, in the spirit of Election 2000, I propose a recount:If you have seen the trailers to this movie, subtract one point. Just like the interstate freeways have become the scourge of small town America, so, too, have trailers become the scourge of good movies. You might recall `Bicentennial Man' with Robin Williams (although it WAS a very forgettable effort).  The trailers had ALL of the funny lines in the entire movie, and you were left mouthing lines as if you were at your favorite music star's concert.  The trailers for WWW had many of the funniest lines, just not all.  But the movie trailers DID lessen the viewing enjoyment of WWW.  7 starsIf you have a difficult time believing that office romances are romantic, subtract another point.  Again, `One Fine Day' worked better because Clooney & Pfeiffer were not working in the same office together.  When will movies and TV get over the fact that potential sexual harassment in the workplace is NOT romantic?  Bad ending. 6 stars.Hurry and pick your rating before we call in the Supremes.",What Women Want

I enjoyed this movie to a point, but it seems like they're gilding the proverbial lily when you give a guy like Mel the additional gift of reading minds -- (wouldn't every male like to have that one?). I think that the part should have gone to an actor with far less looks and that the part should have been more macho.As for chemistry, I definitely disagree with those who say that Mel and Helen lacked it -- I think that it was the strongest part of the film.

179,Ankhoryt,Amazing Grace from Mad Max (and some minor points to ponder),10,6 April 2002,"I've heard this film called anti-feminist.  You can't get more feminist than I am, and I thought it was fine!  I won't spend more time on the Hunt-Gibson chemistry which everyone else has discussed to death, save to say I thought they made a believably flirty pair.  On to some small observations:a.  anyone notice how similar the scene in which Hunt and Gibson dance in the empty-bedroom of her new home is to the closing scene of ""The Big Easy,"" in which Dennis Quaid dances Ellen Barkin around an almost-identical room? Same chemistry, same setting, same action, similar looks on both sets of protagonists.b.  kudos to Gibson on his dancing!!!  I never dreamed he'd be so good.  His solo to ""I've got you under my skin"" blew me away. Most people will compare him to Astaire, but a better match is Gene Kelly.  Just wonderful.  Amazing grace from Mad Max.  And his sudden assumption of gay body language as he moves into his final embrace with Marissa Tomei was deftly done, too.  Let's see Mel in more roles that allow him to express body language other than ""Me strong guy, me kill you, ugh.""  More dancing, PLEASE! Not, mind you, that he isn't awfully attractive doing the me-strong-guy thing... mmm, mmm, mmm. 
c.  Delta Burke appears in a small role as Gibson's secretary.  Not only is she perfect in the part -- no prima donna behavior at all -- but she looks twenty years younger than she is.  Good for her!d.  nice sub-plot on the character Erin planning suicide after maltreatment by cold-hearted bosses.  A good lesson to any boss -- a reminder that a small decision for you may have a huge impact on your subordinates, especially young and impressionable types.e.  Alan Alda must have enjoyed yet another chance to play a chauvinist klutz, so very much in contrast to his well-known feminist politics.  After being Saint Hawkeye for so long, he's really thrown himself into being Mr. Nasty when he can. ""Murder At 1600"" and ""Whispers in the Dark"" come to mind. Ten stars for the humor, the lack of gender-spitefulness in either direction, the lively sub-plots about Erin and Gibson's daughter, and the perfect performances from all involved.",What Women Want
180,hartig,Great concept! Questionable casting.,7,18 December 2000,"Mel Gibson is at the top of his comedic form in this cute little film.  It's sure to be a hit with females (particularly the lovelorn and the high school aged ones).  I laughed out loud at least 10 times - which is about 5 above average for romantic comedies.  I think the Julia Roberts-Meg Ryan-Sandra Bullock-etal romantic comedy genre is a bit tired and it needs some new concepts such as this one.  For this alone, I think ""What Women Want"" is worth watching.But I can't get over the casting choices of Helen Hunt and Marisa Tomei. Hunt is cast as a go-getter professional woman who falls for the guy she competed with for an executive position at a Chicago ad firm.  But she has real trouble playing both a lovestruck woman and a hard-charging professional in the same character.  This is not to say that it can't be done...but Hunt just didn't capture it.Kudos do go to Marisa Tomei for her portrayal of a struggling actress biding her time as a coffee waitress.  She had some real chemistry with Mel Gibson and I wonder how she would have done in Hunt's role.I also enjoyed the work of Ashley Johnson as Gibson's 15-year-old estranged daughter.  She captures the pressures of coming-of-age very well in the relatively short screen time she was offered.7 stars out of 10.",What Women Want
181,lissandra,Too bad the female characters...,6,13 December 2000,"If you're in the mood to spend two hours (maybe even a little more) with Mel Gibson, then this is the movie for you. He's intelligent, he's funny, he's sexy, and you even forgive him for playing a man's man (borderline mysoginist). It's unfortunate that the female characters are not up to par. Helen Hunt was a terrible pick as Gibson's love interest since there is no chemistry between the two of them (not to mention that she looks so much like a man). Now the chemistry with Marisa Tomei is out of this world, but once again she gets stuck in the ditz role (what a waste of talent).The movie starts strong and for about an hour, you're really enjoying yourself. Then things start getting fuzzy in the script and the end is just thrown together haphazardly. Not to mention that the movie is way too long. They could have cut at least 20 minutes of bla bla bla. I left the theater wondering why a movie about what women want had such pathetic female characters... and why is it that what women want is not really a secret? The guy I took to the movie had been expecting some good insight, but he left with no new information on the female psyche.Overall, this movie will draw you to the box office with false promises, but will leave you wondering where the time went. Mel Gibson will rock your world, and Helen Hunt will give you nightmares. It's fluff, which is to be expected, but I'm getting sick of half-ass scripts and poor casting choices. Bottom line, it's a date movie that will give you plenty of time for making out (if Hunt doesn't break the mood).",What Women Want

Too sweet for words. The women in the film are a bunch of hopless losers, all of whom need the help of a man (Gibson, of course) to help them out. Helen Hunt plays Gibson's boss, and she's so sweet and helpless you wonder how she ever got to be a tea-lady,let alone a top executive in a ruthless business like advertising. Gibson stitches her up by stealing her ideas, and naturally she can't do a thing to help herself, poor little thing, until he takes pity on her. His daughter spends most of the film slavering with lust over her boyfriend, then suddenly she inexpicably goes off the idea of having ... with him (why?), but she can't get out of it herself, oh no, Daddy has to come and rescue her.

He can even hear female dogs thinking. This is really cute.  Nick thinks he flipped and visits a Psychoanalyst (Bette Midler).  The scene in the doctor's office is funny and almost works.Meanwhile, back in the office, Nick is passed over for a promotion.  This promotion is given to Darcy (Helen Hunt).  Nick sets out to undermine Darcy hoping to get her job.  Nick and Darcy start off not liking one another, and no one cares if they ever get past that stage.Beautiful and talented Marisa Tomei is relegated to the minor role of Lola, while Helen Hunt, who is neither beautiful nor talented is the love interest for Nick.  Go Figure.  The consensus among my friends is no normal man would be interested in Helen Hunt when Marisa is even a remote chance.What Women Want is a cute premise, but it just doesn't work.I give it a 6.

185,livealot,Delightful Comedy,8,14 June 2003,"MINOR SPOILERS AHEADIs it me or did Mel Gibson seem to play this role a little too well? Despite being outside the target audience for this movie, I still enjoyed this movie and found it to be a rather delightful comedy. My only real complaint will be that it's too long and drags along at the end. But the majority of this movie is a pleasure to watch.
Mel Gibson who starts off a ""man's man"" is an advertising guy who is about to get promoted to Creative Director - he is a legend in his field and the time is right. But of course, things go wrong. The Board instead hires a woman (Helen Hunt), seeing how the world is now a woman's world and pictures of half-naked women no longer sell the products. So... on her first day on the job, Helen makes everyone come up with some ideas for some female products. She gives everyone a box full of the junk. Mel, trying to be new-age tries all the goodies to get into the mind of a woman. An incident with a Blow-Dryer and Bathtub sets the events in motion.

Mel, Helen Hunt, Marisa Tomei, Alan Alda, (plus FABULOUS cameos by Bette Midler and Delta Burke) were perfectly cast.  The only miscasting was Mel Gibson's daughter (Ashley Johnson (Chrissy Seaver from ""Growing Pains""))... She was very whiny all the time, and in the scene where she is sitting in the bathroom stall during her prom...I couldn't understand a single word. One thing that was very special in this movie was the scene with Mel Gibson and the suicidal office women.  I'm sure many can relate to her. All in all... the movie was very enjoyable.

The casting was wonderful, the acting was superb, and the direction was perfect. I heard that Tim Allan had been considered for the lead role. He would've been a great choice, but so was Mel Gibson.

I was pleasantly surprised.Mel Gibson plays a hilarious jerk.  He is so selfish, egotistical and male chauvinistic that you can't help but laugh.  He carries the movie from beginning to end, and does so with complete success.Gibson plays a marketing executive who is passed up for an expected promotion because he needs to learn to market to the female demographic. While brainstorming an assignment related to this deficiency, he is electrocuted and blah blah you know the rest.  What struck me about this movie was how realistic his personal transition was as a result of his newfound ""skill"".  he didn't turn into a completely sympathetic mushmouth right away because that is not the sort of person he was.The supporting cast, especially Alan Alda and Mark Feuerstein are all pretty good.  Helen Hunt is adequate, but not completely believable as the tough savvy executive who takes Gibson's expected promotion right out from under him.

192,itsclear,"""had me at hello""",8,19 December 2000,"Having seen The Family Man first and then comparing What Women Want to it, I have to say that What Women Want easily wins as the better movie.  But as far as something out of the ordinary interesting concepts, The Family Man had the edge... but it didn't have Mel Gibson.And Mel Gibson really made the movie what it was.  His dance sequence to Frank Sinatra was definitely an appreciative physical acting moment equivalent to Jim Carrey scenes and even as nice to look at as a Jackie Chan fight scene.  The comedy soared in the beginning with Gibson first taking advantage of his new found gift, but then it becomes a bit lovey dubby (might be enough to make you bite your watch if you aren't into that stuff) revolving around his guilt for using his mind readings on Helen Hunt.And like the Family Man, there is an ending speech made by the main character to try and win over the heart after losing it.  And like the Family Man, it comes close... but was unable to really do it right.  And I haven't seen a movie done a speech like this that has worked.  Mel Gibson comes close to it, like Tom Cruise in Jerry McGuire, and did it better than the not so good writings for Nicholas Cage in the Family Man.  But in the end, all three movies had me thinkin' that the female character must've been had at ""hello.""  What I did like was a little bit of the role reversal at the end dealing with who was saving who. Overall, I think the movie works pretty well.

Way behind the times in its fantasies.,1,28 December 2000,"As a Mel Gibson fan going all the way back to the first Mad Max, I thought this movie would be entertaining. The trailers shown in previews make it look like a light-hearted comedy. And with all the hype in newspapers,magazines, and late-night talk shows, anyone would think this movie marks a breakthrough for Gibson. What a joke! I don't know anyone -- woman or man, of any age -- who thinks this movie is even slightly amusing (with the exception of seeing Gibson wax his legs). The attitudes toward women all the way through the movie have to make any mature person cringe. For example, one of the awful subplots (and there are several that make the movie seem longer than Tom Hanks' four years on the island) has Gibson involved with a coffee shop waitress. He doesn't care 2 cents for her, goes to bed with her to prove his ""manhood"" (in one of the most vulgar sex scenes in any PG -13 movie!), then totally forgets about her. A week later, she shows up at his apt. house, out of her mind because she can't stand the thought that he doesn't care about her. Of course, he doesn't care about her -- he has a whole new life as ""Mr. Sensitive,"" which apparently doesn't include ever having to say he's sorry for grinding women under his heel. The movie lets him get away from her by saying he's gay -- and supposedly that's all she needs to hear for her insanely obsessive world to be all right again. Why does this movie include so many women with such inane ways of dealing with real life? When we left the movie, everyone was saying how stupid it was -- because it DOESN'T have any insights into what women or men want. You would think this movie was put together by men who hate women -- and themselves. Don't be taken in by all the hype about this movie.

I'm glad she did. Though not one of the great comedies, it was light fun and worth watching for relaxation.My assessment was not felt in the beginning, however.  Much of the opening scenes were ""run of the mill"" character and plot development.  But one standout scene was Mel Gibson's dance routine - a sort of Astaire/Sinatra tribute.  That ended up as a highlight for me.Other than that one bright spot, most of the opening humor was almost cliche.  Mel Gibson's character (Nick?) did some slapstick in drag which is terribly worn out.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in ""Some Like It Hot,"" Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie,"" and Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" were much, much better and left very little for recent actors to explore. Nevertheless, I understand that it was necessary because it provided Gibson a means to acquire his ""magical power"".With the introduction of Gibson's ""superhuman"" power, the movie finally took off, and it was fun the rest of the way.

""What Women Want"" takes us back to a point in Mel Gibson's career in which he had established himself as a top rated leading man for 20 years. Except for some roles in which Gibson had portrayed a more manic type personality - the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, in particular - movie goers would have considered him an actor for dramatic roles. In ""What Women Want,"" however, Mel Gibson emerged in the year 2000 - the some year in which he starred in a very dramatic role in ""The Patriot"" - as a rather brilliant comedic actor. Gibson's casting as an ad executive who epitomizes male chauvinism before an accident involving electrocution enables him to ""get inside"" women's heads, which leads to a newfound empathy for the sake of all women, scores as ""genius"" for both Gibson and director Nancy Meyers. A rather incredible supporting cast has been assembled, starting with Helen Hunt, fresh off an Oscar winning best actress performance in ""As Good as It Gets."" Because some viewers will focus on how great the first half of this movie is, the second half will tend to get dismissed as being perhaps a little too sentimental and ultimately and eventually predictable. OK, perhaps that gives the first half of the movie a ""10"" score; the second half, at worst, deserves a score of ""8,"" and that averages out to a ""9"" in my book. Performances are dead-on great, and the soundtrack, which also helps promote Mel Gibson's dancing talent in one scene that pays tribute somewhat to the era of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, is superb.

Mel is great as the woman thought hearing blessed man, at first he thinks it is a sort of curse but shortly after visiting his shrink played by Bette Midler he realises he has been given this priceless gift. After this he goes on to use it to try and advance in his job by using the thoughts of Helen Hunt (his rival as he sees it in his profession)This is a suprisingly good film and well worth watching.",What Women Want
207,king2,surprisingly lovely,8,1 February 2001,"I'm sick of Helen Hunt. Can't stand her since As Good As It Gets. So I didn't want to see this movie. But the scene where Mel Gibson waxed his leg that they showed on the commercial was so amusing, I finally decided to go (for the matinee, so I wouldn't pay as much). I wasn't expecting much-- I few good laughs at most.This movie caught me by surprise. Mel Gibson, as is his way, was charming, charismatic, etc... very witty. Helen Hunt played her character well, very down to earth and realistic, without pretext. They both had such sincerity.The story was surprisingly touching. Gibson's character can hear women's thoughts, and slowly begins to respect and understand them as a result. The ending has a nice twist. I liked this a lot.",What Women Want

An exercise in analysis perhaps ?This movie was excellent, with good performances all round.  Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson worked very well together, with chemistry in abundance, and good support from Alan Alda, Marissa Tomei and Bette Midler.As for being overlong, the two and a bit hours were over before I realised it.

210,Philip Crowther 2001,Entertaining and annoying comedy,6,17 February 2001,"Nancy Meyers' What Women Want is another much-hyped and heavily publicised success at the US box office. Having arrived in Luxembourg for the ridiculously expensive Valentine's Day premiere at Utopolis, it is now expected to take our cinemas by storm too. And it undoubtedly will, because on paper this is very promising stuff indeed: Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt top the bill, Alan Alda supports, and the synopsis is interesting, to say the least.Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall, a successful advertising executive and notorious `ladies' man' who, after a painful incident involving a bath and a hairdryer, finds he can read women's minds - a welcome gift in theory, but one that turns into a bit of a nightmare and gives our hero his timely come-uppance. His new-found ability (Didn't he realise that men have always been able to read the thoughts of the opposite sex? It's just that, having tuned in, they've never found anything worth listening to ..) initially brings him further success in his job and - more important to the storyline - helps along his romance with his new colleague-cum-rival Darcy McGuire, played by Helen Hunt. But then it all goes pear-shaped as Nick has to cope with the downside of his life as an incorrigible macho.Gibson's influence on this comedy is obvious: his very own production company Icon is involved, and there are numerous references to earlier roles of his. And the screenplay gives him plenty of opportunity to show off his real comic talent and the quality of his interplay with Helen Hunt, who gives another solid performance after her parts in Dr T. and the Women, Cast Away and Pay it Forward - all three of them currently enjoying successful runs in Luxembourg's cinemas. (How about spending a whole Sunday afternoon and evening in a darkened room watching a Helen Hunt quadruple-bill?)So far, so satisfactory. What is disappointing, though - and intensely annoying - is the ending, yet again. This is another example of Hollywood just not knowing how to end a movie nowadays. Only recently we have had the embarrassing efforts of Pay it Forward, Cast Away and Harrison's Flowers lingering in the mind long after the final credits, and all for the wrong reasons. But What Women Want not only has a bad conclusion - it also starts off on the wrong foot. Strangely enough, though, the ninety minutes in between are hugely entertaining: a spot-on romantic comedy. The jokes work and the love story rings true. Gibson and Hunt make a great couple - they not only look good, they act well too.The film also features a couple of secondary plots - one involving Gibson's screen daughter, the other focusing on a suicidal office-worker. Both of these only come into their own in the final quarter of an hour, by which time I would humbly advise you to have left the cinema unless you want to emerge cursing either the director for not shouting `Cut!' in time or the editor for not getting rid of the superfluous footage. If you do leave early you will have seen a far better movie that anyone who sits it out through the painful last act.But don't get me wrong, because even if you stay to the end, you will undoubtedly have been entertained. Good actors, screenplay, editing (apart from the last bit!) and, crucially, superb comic timing combine to produce a refreshing film, one that stands out from the monotonous run of romcoms made in the US of A.",What Women Want

I often find myself using Mel's lines (during the product testing) when I'm experiencing new things. The hot wax job was SO hilarious!The father/daughter shopping spree was humorous and touching.

After all, he kicked the English out of Scotland and was a flying rooster.  As for 'What Women Want'.... urgh.It's an interesting idea - giving a man the ability to hear women's thoughts.  After this idea though you are left with Mel Gibson and the Helen Hunt flirting their way through a not-terribly-well scripted cigarette advert.

I liked this movie and hope that men will begin to understand that women do think about other things besides sex.  The music is really good and the commentary allows you to notice things in the movie that you would otherwise skipped over. Helen Hunt plays a bright, intelligent woman in an understated way.  Nice to see Alan Alda again. It was nice to see a guy begin to understand and care about someone else in a nuturing way.  This movie gives me chuckles and a pause to think.",What Women Want

YAWN!!! Mel's antics are great and his relationship with his daughter show that he has alot of catching up to do as a dad...but this film is convoluted by the fact that we never really focus on any one thing as a theme. Case in point: the employee that is suicidal...Mel could have had a real moment. I'm not sure if it was a faux pas by the director or the editing group, but what the hell happened?

But then it turned to be really funny, really great ... and then...Well, actually, Mel Gibson movies are very good ones. He is a great actor and deserved the Oscar. And there is Helen Hunt. Well, she is a quite good actor, but she didn't deserve the Oscar. Since then I am always very careful, when I watch a movie with her.Like I said above, the movie started with nothing spectacular. Mel Gibson plays a pure macho. He is the ""men's man"". Sexy. Smart. And he is successful in his job. He is actually awaiting a promotion. BUT, then this happens. His Boss tells him, they want the women, they want this target group. So the poor Nick (Mel Gibson) doesn't get his promotion. Even worse, a woman gets the job, he should have get. This makes him very upset, very. And it gets worse. Darcy (Helen Hunt) gives ever employee a ""woman"" package with articles which are made for women. At home Nick tries to think into women, tries all the articles and then it happens. He slips fells in the bath with a turned on hair dryer. Luckily he doesn't die, but then he finds out, he can hear what women think...Sounds like a nice plot. Well it would be, if they didn't screwed it all up.

After Mel discovers that he can hear what women think the filmakers play that joke til  the end of movie.  Mel Gibson gives does a good job with the material he has.  Tomei is wasted in a bit part.  Helen Hunt is the leading lady in another movie starring a big name actor this year (Dr. T and the Women,Pay it Forward,Castaway).  She does a decent job, although I think other actresses would have been better.  Maybe they were too smart to take the part.  There is a subplot about how Mel's daughter (little Crissy from Growing Pains)hates him and plans on losing her virginity on prom night.

Well, this wonderful Sinatraesque movie is a spin on that--- except, to the delight of the distaff side of the human race, it is Mel Gibson being enveloped by Helen Hunt at the end.

That being said, overall, the movie is quite enjoyable. Gibson and Hunt give great performances and have good chemistry, and the cast is well filled out with good performances in secondary roles by Alan Alda, Marissa Tomei, Bette Middler, Judy Greer, and others. The main thing I really liked about the film was its style. The film really showcases Chicago beautifully, and the whole visual concept of it is gorgeous, the set interiors of Nick's apartment and the advertising firm, a dark but still warm midcentury appeal in the former, early 20th Century commercial American Beaux Arts in the latter, with lots of warm dark woods and leather, and Gibson's and Hunt's wardrobes fit well with the interiors, a lot of classic styles with wools and suedes, it all has a very autumnal palette.

Appearances by Marisa Tomei and Alan Alda offered no credibility to the script. Some characters' actions were so unbelievable they seemed to be under the influence of some chemical, unable to make sound, rational decisions.

I guess over the four years that have passed since it came out I have learned that a WHOLE LOT of what the movie portrays in a jokish sort of way is actually true.Mel Gibson and Holly Hunter are awesome. Not just Mel Gibson, as many reviews seem to emphasize. Stunning as his performance may be, Mr. Lethal Weapon (a different sort of in this movie, well, since you're here you probably already know what I'm talking about) actually comes out this good because of other actors, surrounding him with unbelievably true and real characters, and more often than not stealing the show. We have our ""not quite what she seems to be"" successful careerist, a ""Hollywood actress wannabe"" waitress looking for THE guy, an ""indeed more than you think"" teenager, a ""no one gives a further thought about me so I guess I'll just go commit suicide"" associate nobody, and a BAD guy being cleansed... by learning to understand women's logic. Oops, I just gave it away. Here's something that will justify your 8 dollars though: unlike in tons of other clichéd romantic comedies, the way these characters are realized is likely to make you care about them.Besides, admit it: you want to see Mel Gibson do Fred Astaire to IL' Blue Eyes against the most beautiful skyline in the world, lie about his orientation, and... epitomize just what most of us men want.You do? Then whatcha waiting for? Go out, like, today and rent it!

234,gustavpapillon,What love story?,1,13 July 2003,"""What Women Want"" is one film I could have lived without seeing. The characters are devoid of human feeling, and they have zero motivation. And its weak story could have made nearly enough material for a half-hour sitcom. I could barely stand watching Mel Gibson's performance as a man who obtains, through accident, an ability for understanding women. He learns to use his talent to spy on the private thoughts of women, essentially becoming a Peeping Tom, as it were. Helen Hunt did nothing to convince me there was any chemistry between principal characters, Nick and Darcy. Instead, I watched uncomfortably as these two stumbled and balked over what could have been very moving and romantic scenes. Director Nancy Meyers's approach was off target, and I never believed the two could ever hit it off.Gibson, who has become increasingly credible in dramatic roles, seemed to be out of his element within this context. His mannerisms gave me the impression that some scenes were shot only once, and barely rehearsed. And the lack of chemistry between him and Ms. Hunt led me to believe they had only seen the script a few hours before shooting and had only just arrived on the set.I was truly disappointed when the film dropped the ball on the relationship between Nick and Lola (Marisa Tomei). I thought this was a much better matchup. The audience is given a taste of something sweet, only to discover bitterness underneath. We are never completely satisfied.This film was really a waste of time and effort. I do not recommend it.

I suppose its kind of chic and a counterbalance to 50s themes of women being dumb dolls who basically need big strong men to look after them. But it palls very fast unless you like humiliation as a gag. In some sense it is a comment on the dismal relations between men and women in East coast America. The women are painted, self-centred, ambitious and ultimately as useless as Gibson's main character.Interestingly the film starts off by presenting Gibson's character as a 'man's man' (quote). In the short scenes that follow the 'man's man' is portrayed as a total jerk. The implication is that what men value in men and admire is crass and useless too. The alternative models of manhood (and there have been very many great men) are reduced to this shallow portrayal. In that sense the film is an accurate portrayal of a society that has lost touch with male values.

I sat watching this movie waiting for something original, something I had not heard before, something that was not mere cotton candy comedy. I never got what I was looking for. Nick Marshall is a male chauvinist who has no idea or care for how a woman thinks. Gibson does a nice job with the hand he is dealt. Darcy Maguire is Nick's new boss, an intelligent woman who is a genius at marketing. This just happens to be Nick's occupation as well and Darcy has the title that Nick himself wants. Fate allows Nick to begin to hear what women are thinking and thus the title of the film. Knowing the premise I could tell where the movie was going and where it would end. Would Nick learn his lesson? Would Darcy fall for Nick? Would Nick fall for Darcy? What do you think? What this movie is trying to do was done much better in 1982's Tootsie.

And, despite the fact that I believe that Mel Gibson has more range than any actor today (from Lethal Weapon to the best Hamlet I've ever seen), the question was how would he hold up in a mainly comedic role.  He was not a disappointment. Like other characters he has played, Gibson made this guy seem like it was his own persona. Hunt acted to exactly what we expect of her comedy, a fine performance.

248,KevinB-2,"Wonderful, fun, light-hearted, feel-good romance",9,2 June 2001,"Some people criticize this movie for a variety of reasons. We just watched it and we loved it. It exceeded all of our expectations. My partner and I did not find the movie too long; in fact she commented at the end that she was disappointed that it was over so soon. I felt the same way.I guess it's all a question of what you're expecting. One board commenter expressed disappointment that there wasn't any real insight into ""what women want."" Our view on that is that we didn't expect any deep insight from such a movie. We were looking for a light-hearted comedy that entertained us on a Friday night, let us spend some quality time snuggling on the coach sharing a good time, and provided some nice relief from the week's stresses. The movie succeeded.I suppose if I were a professional film-maker or a film professor or something, I could dissect the movie and come up with all kinds of criticisms. I read Ebert's review and he nit-picked on a number of points and pointed out how it could have been better. But you know what? Roger Ebert has trouble enjoying a movie the way it's intended to be enjoyed because he earns his living criticizing movies! He *HAS* to find fault with a movie. He can't just write ""Hey, it was a fun movie. I enjoyed it. If you want a nice romantic comedy, you'll enjoy it."" He'd lose his job! He's a professional critic and doesn't just enjoy a movie, he has to figure out how he would have made it better. Fortunately, I'm not burdened by that.One last note. I've read several critiques of Helen Hunt being inappropriate for the part. Again, whether someone else would have been better or not isn't the point for me. I thought she did well. I thought the movie worked. Yes, I didn't think at first that they had a natural ""chemistry,"" but that was the point. They started out as competitors for the same job and the situation was naturally antagonistic. Through all of that, as Mel Gibson developed his ""insight,"" they grew closer together. I thought the romance worked, at least well enough to make us smile and to not be distracted at all. (Besides, I wonder if people who expect ""natural chemistry"" between an actor and actress expect the same in real life. Just because two people instantly ""click"" doesn't mean there is going to be a deep, lasting relationship there, and the converse holds as well.)I've written before that one of my acid tests for a movie is whether or not I check the clock (or VCR timer) to see how much longer before the movie is over (and if I do check it, why). I found myself checking the VCR timer only once on this movie, and it was because I did *NOT* want it to end. For me, that's a simple measure of enjoyment. The movie took me on a trip I wanted to go on, it lived up to my expectations, even exceeding them, and entertained us both for two hours.Don't rent it expecting to find a treatise on what women want. Rent it to be entertained. If you approach it that way, it's a very enjoyable movie.",What Women Want

I realize this movie is intended for the average six hours of TV per night family, but just once I would have enjoyed seeing hollywood live up to the talent of its stars. This was a rare chance to actually make a quality movie. All the requisite talent was there. A splendid chance to deal with women's problems in the modern world, which really are deeper than ""What great buns"", is not only dealt with in a totally superficial way, they don't even scratch the paint.

252,emsleaves,"very funny, but not so happy with ending",6,19 June 2004,"This movie starts out well enough.  In fact, it is very promising, at least in the first half.  There are the great gags with Mel trying on pantyhose, using a blowdryer improperly, etc.  And then there is the event, the event that changes his fate.  Mel's character is about to learn a lot.  And Mel Gibson is the man to watch.  I love to watch Mel Gibson in this film.I love the comments on women's place in society, though I am dismayed a bit by the nature of the women in the movie.  It seems these women choose as though programmed to want what they want.  It seems too controlled.  More oddball, out-there women would have made this film better for me.DEFINITE SPOILERS:  I absolutely love the lightening strike, not one, but a few.  And the women's thoughts are relevant to Mel's character, Nick.  But I am not sure that those are the thoughts I'd be having, exactly.  There is a kind of lack of realism in the content and narration of the thoughts, though a definite honesty.  The honesty is what prevails.I am also touched that Nick helps a very troubled girl, but was quite troubled by my second viewing that he couldn't possibly in the end.What made me most annoyed was the ending.  It was a typical romantic comedy ending.  Nick gets what he deserves for misusing one lovely and good woman's thoughts.  However, he still gets the girl.  It isn't quite right.  It's too sweet.  Is this really what a man should get when he's tried to ruin someone's reputation?  Is the woman, a seemingly independent woman, going to take him back like that?  This was all a little too sweet for me.Nick learns, but what does this say really, about how much men can learn when reading a woman's surface thoughts?  Especially when some of these thoughts are a little too simple.  Are thoughts to be read to get women (""get"" having many meanings here) and then have things turn out?  I like Nick less as the film goes on, but like him because he's played by Mel, but not convinced he deserves what he gets.  And I'm not convinced that even if this woman loves him, this is how the film's last encounter would go.  Sure, it's possible for a woman to accept him romantically, but what moral message, or even message about reality, is sent here?  It's not quite right to me.",What Women Want

So, let me say what I have to say.
The storyline is something old, but expressed in a new way. There is romance, but a mature, not a cheesy one. The main idea (that there is no need for men to read our minds, but to listen what we say, like in 80%, not in 3%) is smoothly expressed throughout the movie.

The audience is delivered quite a good insight into his moral -- compared to his workmates, who are astonished, what a man Nick actually can be.Yet, as soon as he falls in love with Darcy, the whole film is drawn slowly but irresistibly towards a drama losing much of its potential. It seems that Nancy Meyers tried to combine the funny plot with an appealing drama. Unfortunately, the movie just can't cope with such a claim.The performances of Gibson and Hunt are remarkable.

Certain parts went on too long for comfort, the ending especially being a drag.  And maybe this had to happen, but the makers barely touched on some of the humongous implications of female mindreading (e.g., it applies to female animals as well).There was filmmaker prejudice even aside from the sexism, like in the thoughts of the one black woman in the movie.  On the rare occasions that I laughed, I felt ashamed of it because the jokes were far from clever.Despite the title, men left the theater saying they still didn't know what women want.  My family was not convinced that Gibson's character had learned much either.  The title may hark back to the words of a psychologist nearly abandoned in the scientific community, but I suspect the makers wanted us to think of sexual intercourse.  If so, we had a single non-expository scene to pander to our lecherous desires.In short, the only basic negative elements I did not see in this movie were inappropriate violence and bad acting.  It was Mel Gibson who persuaded me to give this movie as many as 2 stars out of 4.",What Women Want
283,erawillmoth,Didn't Enjoy,1,10 August 2017,"I did not like this film at all, even despite the fact the humour was executed well. The main point of the movie seemed to be to show the main character Marshall, played by Gibson, that women actually did have feelings and personalities. The way women were portrayed in the movie, however, seemed to me to be counterproductive to this, since the majority of them (I won't say all because I don't have a photographic memory of the film) came across as shallow and as being mere accessories to the plot, rather than characters in themselves. The only women who had one iota of personality (excluding Marshall's teenaged daughter, who probably had a personality to make up for the fact that the filmmakers morally couldn't sexualise her) seemed to be the secondary main character McGuire, whose thoughts still managed to centre the majority of the time on Marshall and her opinions of him, or, conveniently, on some new idea Marshall could exploit.The main problem of the film to me was that Marshall did not seem to learn anything at all. He apparently was so misogynistic that it didn't occur to him women were independent beings capable of thought and this 'myth' for him seems to have by the end been debunked, but the idea that he supposedly learnt that women were equal to men didn't come across. In fact, the film seemed to make valid his opinion that women were only there for sex with men (eg. the end, in which Marshall ends up having sex with McGuire). McGuire's personality, in fact, seems to have been written into the film purely to make her 'hard to get', and therefore further drives home the message that women are there for men's benefit.This is the most misogynistic film I have ever seen.",What Women Want

His portrayal of the ""Man's Man"" is what one would expect of that ""stereotype"". Very macho and definitely not PC! While the acting may not have been up to Hunt's ""Good As It Gets"" fame, she worked well as the strong, yet sensitive executive.

I think it's worth the price of a movie ticket, even though it's pretty predictable.Most of the comments seem to complain about reinforcing stereotypes and portraying women as having shallow thoughts.  Keep in mind that the character (played by Mel Gibson), who is listening to women's thoughts, is a person who has grown up always thinking of women in a shallow way.  Just as he has spent his life being so self-absorbed and tuning out women's conversations unless they directly relate to him, he's going to be doing the same listening to women's thoughts (especially at first).  We, the audience, are only hearing the thoughts that he chooses to hear.

In fact it was one of the most compelling ads I have seen in years and that includes all the superbowl ads... but that is why I was so incensed.  The screenwriters could have used some unnamed big firm that needs to do an ad directed at women, but no, instead the makers of this film chose to take the multi multi millions that nike offered them and do the ultimate product placement.So as long as you go in completely aware that this is about two ad execs courting the Nike execs (whose professional lives I frankly didn't care about) than enjoy.

291,Jamie-150,Mostly fluff with some decent insights,6,19 December 2000,"I thought Helen Hunt did darn well as a smart and capable executive taken by surprise by a personal life that snuck up on her. I'm not a big fan of hers, so *I* was taken by surprise by liking her. Early in the movie, rumors abound (among the ""man's men"" - we never do get to hear what her peers of more open mind thought of her) that she's a ""maneater""; then she shows up and is full of energy and good professional judgment, is generous in giving credit where she believes it's due, and (in her inner voice) has some ambivalence about her role in the company and her abilities. It rang true to me; I've known many women in this situation.NOT A TRUE SPOILER BUT A HINT ABOUT A PREDICTABLE PLOT POINT: I thought her action at the end in responding to Mel Gibson's confession was absolutely right on and I applaud the writers for giving her character the guts to do it.I thought the start of the movie was slooooow... Mel was more of a caricature than a character for a good long time. But once he started hearing women's thoughts he seemed to me to hit his stride. I quibble with the affair with Marisa Tomei, though I recognize why it was there. And I thought its resolution was clever, though a little too convenient.Clearly a ""feel-good"" movie with all the (minimal) depth and heft that that phrase implies, but this I liked particularly: from time to time, Mel would ""overhear"" a thought that gave him pause, and he'd stop in his tracks, bemused. Sometimes he was charmed; sometimes he was shocked. While the thoughts he overheard weren't particularly earth-shattering to a woman, many were echoes of what I sometimes hear in my own head, and it was nice to see a man's reaction to them.",What Women Want

Starring not only in this movie, last week's number one, but also in Cast Away, which will undoubtedly be this week's number one grossing movie.I did enjoy this movie, so much that it prompted me to see a second time. The odd thing was that enjoyed just as much the second time.  It is not the world's most heady movie.  It contains no great revelations on a woman's psyche or on life in general.  It will not change your life.  It WILL however make you smile as you leave the theater, and you might even think about it the entire next day.  I know I did.I have read other reviews, and they all complain that this flick fizzled- it just was just not as insightful as they would have hoped.  The thing is that it wasn't supposed to be.  If you went in wanting a guide to a woman's heart, or at least some basic rules, you will be disappointed.  But, hey, I knew that before I went into the theater.A movie is supposed to entertain, and one of the most common ways to do that is to show an audience a likeable character with a few faults.  Of course, the character is oblivious to those faults, but something drastic happens and the character is suddenly made aware.  It's not supposed to educate, but to entertain as the character's arc of change occurs.Mel Gibson is great.  Once again, he is his own charismatic self, and you can't help but be interested.  Helen Hunt is gorgeous and vulnerable, and I am sad to say that I am in love with her.  Or at least her character.I am teenage boy, fickle and cynical, and I loved this movie.  I recommend to anyone who would like to see a feel good romantic comedy over the holidays.  Don't try to analyze too much, it's bad for your soul.**",What Women Want

307,psychick29,Enjoy it for what it is,8,25 June 2001,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was surprised at how much  disparaging remarks this movie got.If you're stuck on your impressions of the type and personality of what actors Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt have played in previous movies then I think you'll fall into the category of criticism for the two as a romantic couple.I found the chemistry between them believable...Hunt is suppose to play a smart classy woman, strong in a man's world (executive position), but sensitive and that's exactly what I found her to be.  I think she delivered her lines quite naturally and simply can't believe how cold and unnatural people say she was, I guess it's in the eye of the beholder.  Gibson is an excellent cast for the macho man's man who is also able to be very natural in the sensitive parts of the role (can you imagine pretty faced Tom Cruise or youthful looking Michael J. Fox playing macho men?).Sure I agree Marisa Tomei was excellent in this movie but the comments that she should have had a bigger part, well that wasn't the point of this movie when the final script was set, so there's no point in deliberating on it. The director's message (at least what I interpreted it as) was that she wanted this chauvinistic male to learn to ""see"" what he was and that it didn't work in this modern world with modern women and finally be ""saved"" from his faulty character.  It wasn't really about ""What women want"" but about the development and change of one man.  If you have access to a DVD player, rent the DVD and listen to the comments of the Director, you'd get a better understanding and enjoyment of what the movie was about and why certain people were cast in the roles they were.The only criticism I really had with the movie was the ending.  It seemed too rushed.  All of a sudden at the end, everything comes out in 5 minutes, mistakes are forgiven and everything is happy. I don't think they gave Helen Hunt's character enough time to absorb Nick's (Gibson) confession before she forgave him..that was a little unbelievable.Otherwise the movie was a great length, I didn't think it was too long, but then I wasn't bored like others were, and I liked the comedy, laughed in all the right parts and bought into the romance.",What Women Want

I thought it was a great romantic comedy -- and I'm a man, ya know. Plus I really like Mel Gibson.I tend not to forget almost every scene or the most important ones of a film, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy watching a movie twice or more times. I saw this thing going on on A&E, and ""What Women Want"" was gonna be on so I decided to watch it, since i remembered it was a funny movie.When the movie was over I realized this: The movie is divided in two parts: the first half, and the second half. The first half is more comedy than romance, and the second half was more romance than comedy. The first half is from the beginning to the sex-with-Marisa-Tomei scene, and the second half is from the shopping scene to the end. After that, I acknowledged this: the first half of the movie is for an audience of guys and girls, and the second half of the movie is for an audience of gays and girls. Ya get the picture? The first time I saw the film I enjoyed it. I put up with the second half because it had caught me from the beginning, plus there were some funny situations, like the last scene with Marisa Tomei, where Mel tells her he's gay... that was really funny, but the rest is just girly stuff. And what more of a perfect way to present this second part if not by a shopping scene.Suming it all up, if you haven't watched it... well I'm sorry for the spoilers, but I mean, rent it, it's a very funny comedy... the first time you see it.

316,asafoetidabaumgartner,Clever premise promises--but delivers disappointment,5,22 June 2018,"The standard formula for a feature film:  Protagonist + antagonist + plot point one
 -> 
 changed protagonist + what do I do now? + antagonist 
 -> 
 protagonist + do the wrong thing + antagonist 
 -> 
 protagonist + Aha! + antagonist 
 -> 
 resolution of sorts.is okay as far as it goes, but ""What Women Want"" demonstrates that a flick can follow the formula and still fail to succeed! The problem is that the audience has to care about the protagonist and the antagonist. I didn't give a damn about Mel Gibson's problem with being passed over in favor of Helen Hunt at the ad agency he works for. So, when he nigh onto electrocutes himself and finds he now can hear women's thoughts--well, it was an interesting concept, but, apparently, once a schmuck, always a schmuck. He discovers his ability enables him to be attractive to women, so he puts the make on the coffee barista lady (Marisa Tomei) and then drops her without a second thought. It gives him a window into his daughter's world (predictable subplot). But, in the thing that is most important to him, viz., his job status, it enables him to steal Helen Hunt's ideas, which ends up getting her fired. Later, he repents and scurries about trying to set things right. I was so repelled by his opportunistic appropriation of his boss's ideas, that I actually couldn't bear to watch it, so I fast forwarded over some of the scenes (a luxury one does not get in a cinema). I didn't like him. I didn't care about him. So, I didn't care about him getting religion in the final reel. I felt sorry for Helen Hunt (time was, I would have paid to watch her read a telephone book--remember those?), but I was glad I decided not to watch him destroying her self-confidence.It seemed that the writers of ""What Women Want"" were enamored of their characters, but they really didn't care about them. They manipulated the characters like puppets for formulaic effect.
