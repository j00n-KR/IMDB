0,TheLittleSongbird,Enjoyable,7,6 November 2011,"Double Jeopardy actually seemed like my sort of film, and when I finally saw it I thought it was enjoyable. It is far from flawless, although the premise was interesting the story itself has some credibility lapses and has a lot of derivative elements. The film has the odd draggy moment and the characters are rather clichéd. On the other hand, Double Jeopardy looks wonderful, with striking scenery and stylish photography and editing. The music is not too generic either and it helps the atmosphere, and the script is well paced and sharp. Double Jeopardy is also well directed and Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd give great lead performances, and although the rest of the characters aren't as interesting or as well written, effort is done both in written and performance quality to make them credible. Overall, an enjoyable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Double Jeopardy
1,bkoganbing,A Murder On The State?,5,24 February 2011,"It's unfortunate that poor Ashley Judd met all kinds of good legal help after she was convicted of murdering Bruce Greenwood in Double Jeopardy. Where was it when she was on trial?Ashley Judd is the wife of Bruce Greenwood a successful developer and they seem to be a rich and happy couple. But Greenwood's been overextending himself credit wise and he's in a real bind. One night on board they're yacht after a night of passion, he seemingly falls overboard after a violent struggle and leaves an incriminating 911 call.Who else could it incriminate but Judd and she's tried and convicted of her husband's murder. Her best friend Annabeth Gish adopts her son, but then Judd discovers that Gish has moved out of their Seattle area and then she inadvertently finds out that her husband is still alive. It takes six years, but she's granted a parole, but she's not about to wait in a halfway house. She's busts her parole and goes on the hunt with her parole officer Tommy Lee Jones on her trail.Her legal advice comes from Jones, a former law professor and Roma Maffia a disbarred attorney she meets in the joint. If these two had been her attorneys she might have been acquitted. Maffia especially gives a memorable performance in a very small role.Double Jeopardy has a number of flaws in it. Firstly if I had been Bruce Greenwood I sure would have fled the country with my ill gotten gains and not lived so public a lifestyle as he does. Could not wrap my head around his recklessness. Also Judd specifically does not want her son to go to her mother because they didn't get along. Yet it's mom played by Anna Hagan comes through in the end for her with quite a roll of bills to help her in her pursuit of Greenwood. And the whole concept of what Double Jeopardy means is open to question. I recall a Law And Order episode where someone was killed by a person who had committed a crime for which they had not done the deed and most emphatically that did not grant him the newly freed perpetrator a murder on the state.It's unfortunate because I think Double Jeopardy had a role lot of potential that was wasted.",Double Jeopardy
2,Leofwine_draca,Could be better,5,10 February 2020,"DOUBLE JEOPARDY is an acceptable thriller from 1999 but more of a routine way to end the decade than the likes of THE MATRIX, which must have made this feel very staid by comparison. It's another opportunity for Tommy Lee Jones to show off his hunting prowess, this time tracking down former convict Ashley Judd who's on a mission to solve a conspiracy surrounding her husband's mysterious death. This film pales in comparison to THE FUGITIVE and U.S. MARSHALS, although it has some fun action set-pieces shoehorned into the plot here and there. However, the main mystery story has ludicrous holes and is frankly unbelievable when you start considering it too much. Judd is also one of the coldest actresses from the era, and the ending smacks of safe predictability. Could be better...",Double Jeopardy
3,SnoopyStyle,One must overlook the questionable concept,6,18 July 2014,"Nick Parsons (Bruce Greenwood) is a successful investment dealer with loving wife Libby (Ashley Judd) and son. He takes her out on their new boat but he goes missing with signs of struggle. She is convicted for his murder. She asks her friend Angela Green (Annabeth Gish) to adopt her son instead of leaving him a ward of the state. Angela goes away with her son. Libby tracks them down and her son let slip that Nick is still alive. Prison lawyer Margaret tells her about double jeopardy that she can't be convicted again even if she kills her husband. After 6 years in prison, she is paroled under the supervision of hard-nosed Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) at the halfway house.The basic concept is questionable at best. On top of that, it forces the movie to be a slow grind for the trial. The movie is better off skipping much of that section. The murder trial feels very rushed. It's where a montage could really help or at least something to drive a more exciting opening. Once it gets to Tommy Lee Jones, this movie moves well. Judd and Jones have a good Fugitive feel. It's got good tension, but one must always overlook the questionable basic concept.",Double Jeopardy
4,Hitchcoc,Laughably Far Fetched,4,13 September 2010,"The premise of this film is a good one. It is well set up and interesting from the start. It's downhill from there on. While there are slick action sequences and lots of close calls, the possibility of these things taking place is preposterous. First of all, no body and a conviction. It almost never happens. Aren't there any forensics? What about the blood? Was it his. The prison scenes are so antiseptic with the two buddies becoming the immediate friends. Then there is old bulldog Tommy Lee Jones (one of my favorite actors) with his own ghosts. The downfall of the film, however, is that it defies the the law of gravity. The whole thing winds down to where we are supposed to believe that the diminutive Ashley Judd is able to accomplish all this because she ran around in the rain and pumped a little iron in prison. By the way, does anyone know how loud a gun is in a closed space when fired right near one's ear? It's just another one of those questions that makes this whole thing ludicrous.",Double Jeopardy

Six years later, Libby is on probation under the care of her tough officer and former lawyer and Professor Travis (Tommy Lee Jones).

There are no explanations for many situations, like, for example, the blood on the vessel and in Libby's clothes, or how a public persona can be so invisible. But the plot is engaging and if the viewer shutdown the brain for the flaws, will centainly enjoy this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Risco Duplo"" (""Double Risk"")",Double Jeopardy

I would have loved to see Foster in this, as personally I find Judd to be a weak actress and not very engaging.As far as mysteries or thrillers go, this one is pretty good but suffers from a major flaw: the premise is just not true.

In fact, this movie isn't half bad. I understand that what the movie portrays isn't exactly accurate, but it's still a pretty fun flick. Usually I don't take any interest in these kinds of movies, but I kind of liked this one. It showed Ashley Judd to be a pretty capable actress. Worth seeing.

8,jboothmillard,Double Jeopardy,6,30 October 2007,"From director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy), I remember seeing a small poster for this film in the year of its release, and being a fan of the actor from Men in Black I was certainly up for it. Basically Elizabeth 'Libby' Parsons (Bug's Ashley Judd) is happily married to Nicholas 'Nick' (Swept Away's Bruce Greenwood) and has wonderful son Matty (Age 4, Benjamin Weir), and then after spending the night on their boat, Libby wakes to find Nick gone, blood all over the place, and a knife covered in it. After an investigation and trial, it is discovered that Nick had a two million dollar insurance policy, and she was in financial trouble, so they charge her for murder and believe she killed him for the money. In prison Libby allows her friend Angela 'Angie' Green (Annabeth Gish) to adopt Matty, and during a phone call to him, she hears him call to his daddy, Nick is alive and has set her up! She also learns that because she's already charged with a murder she cannot be convicted for the same crime (or victim) twice, this is known as double jeopardy, so she keeps this in mind that she can kill Nick and there is nothing the law can do. After giving a compelling statement to the prison officials to apply for parole, Libby is put in the custody of parole officer, and former lawyer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), who knows himself what it is like to lose a child. As she is on parole she has a certain set of rules to follow from Travis in terms of curfew, but she ignores all of this and when she can tries to find a way to trace Angie or her son. After she is caught breaking into Angie's school to get her record she is to be taken somewhere more secure with Travis, but she manages to escape when she causes an incident on the boat they are travelling. While Travis is trying to track Libby down, she has found out that Angie died, but she traces the routes through some art work, and eventually she tracks down Nick, under the new name of Jonathan Devereaux. Instead of planning to kill him she confronts him at an auction evening, and she demands to have her son back, and he agrees to meet her in a cemetery, but just when she thinks she has found Matty again he has hired a fake kid and knocks her out. Libby manages to escape her coffin in the mausoleum, and even though Travis catches her going back for Nick, he is now convinced, having followed her movements, that she is telling the truth about her innocence. In the end Travis and Libby confront Nick about his crimes, and after demands and blackmail he does tell them where Matty is, but it turns into a violent fight and he ends up shot, with Travis wounded as well, but Libby does finally get Matty (Age 11, Spencer Treat Clark) back. Also starring Jay Brazeau as Bobby Long, John Maclaren as Rudy, Edward Evanko as Warren and Bruce Campbell as Bartender at Party. Judd gives a believable and compelling performance as the mother put through a nightmare and wanting revenge and her son back, Jones gets his moments as the parole officer chasing her and eventually swaying to her side, and Greenwood is rather a nasty villain as the cheating husband that fakes his death. I read that this was a big hit in America, and no wonder, it is a little bit of a preposterous idea, but at the same time you can go along with it and have a great time, it is full of exciting and entertaining, a most watchable action thriller. Good!",Double Jeopardy
9,ccthemovieman-1,Some Credibility Gaps But A Fun Fugitive-Type Tale,8,1 April 2006,"With two really good lead actors and people I like to watch (Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd) plus an on-the-run-""Fugitive""-type story, I expected a lot. I wasn't disappointed, either, although it's a bit hokey.This is a very intense, involving story, a la the above-mentioned ""The Fugitive,"" except this time it's a woman chasing down her ex-husband who set her up for murder. Once again, we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposed-criminal.As interesting as the story is, there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the ex-husband in the first place or the always-annoying hesitation-before-shooting at the end which saves the ""good guy""...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic. Will Hollywood ever stop that nonsense? However, clichés aside, overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it.

Gish is their best friend. Greenwood fakes his own murder after setting the stage for the arrest and conviction of Judd. She accidentally discovers that Greenwood and Gish have betrayed her and run off with the kid.Six years go by. Judd is paroled under the supervision of the hard-nosed Tommy Lee Jones. But she skips, and by means of some tricks discovers that Greenwood has murdered Gish and moved to New Orleans where he is now a pillar of the community. This greatly irritates Judd, who tracks him down, with Jones in hot pursuit.There are some pretty good action sequences. It's not often an escaped prisoner, manacled to a car door, will start the car and race it off the ferry's aft ramp. And there are other exciting moments. At one point, Judd is knocked out and wakes up to find herself locked into a coffin in one of those above-ground mausoleums in New Orleans' famous All Saints Cemetery.Judd isn't bad. She gets the job done. But she's been able to do more than that in some of her other work, most notably ""Heat."" Still, it's enthralling to witness her features at times turn into a pageant of fleeting expressions.

Too bad.As thrillers go, this one isn't as repulsive as many others. Is there a car chase? Are you kidding? The ""double jeopardy"" business is a lot of hooey.

Naturally she wants justice, but more importantly wants her child back. Jaded viewers might be quick to point out the plot-holes, coincidences, and general manipulation inherent in the story's concept, but when a revenge-melodrama works this well it's awfully tough to complain.

Ashley Judd does a great job as a woman convicted of killing her husband and realizing later that he's still alive. The title, of course, comes from the fact that since she's already been convicted of killing him once, if she finds him and kills him for real, she can't be tried again.Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as her parole officer, and Bruce Greenwood is the dead husband who's not so dead.Although this movie was very entertaining and well acted, it was extremely derivative.

Poor Angela she`s gets convicted of a murder she didn`t commit and gets sentenced to life imprisonment . Forgive for noticing but when murderers aren`t getting their ass fried for killing someone aren`t they getting thrown in jail for 99 years or life imprisonment without parole , whatever one is longer ?

Sorry but this gives dramatic license a bad name The rest of the movie plays out in a similar manner to THE FUGITIVE with those cheats that only seem to happen in these type of movies , y`know like when the fugitive is looking for something that will clear their name the forces of law and order walk in and there`s been a time lapse which means the fugitive is now driving off in their car making their escape even if there`s not been enough onscreen time for them to make a getaway .
Tommy Lee Jones as always gives a very convincing performance but considering he`s more or less playing the same role he did in THE FUGITIVE that`s hardly a compliment .

20,view_and_review,The Fugitive III,3,17 December 2020,"This movie failed to launch. I don't know if it was Ashley Judd's blanche featureless face or the speed in which the movie skipped to the conflict. Within ten minutes Elizabeth ""Libby"" Parsons (Ashley Judd) went from nice home on the water among friends, to sex with husband while sailing, to being blood soaked with, presumably, her husband's blood. Her husband was presumed dead and she was the main suspect though it's understood that she didn't kill him. In the next ten minutes she was arrested, tried, and convicted for her husband's murder.Without a doubt, Libby was the victim in this, but dam if I didn't feel an iota of sympathy. Libby was just a random pretty face who got played, but there was no real connection there. They hadn't established any real drive, nor had they cemented Libby as a sympathetic character. She was set up, yes, but people are set up in movies all of the time, so why is her case special? For all we know, she may have deserved it.In prison, where life was fairly stable and normal--which again worked against our main character being a sympathetic figure--Libby finds out that her husband is still alive and with her best friend Angie (Annabeth Gish).Now Libby has motivation.She was told by the jailhouse lawyer that she could ""kill her husband in Times Square"" and not be convicted because of double jeopardy.I can't believe they built a movie upon that premise. Double jeopardy doesn't apply nationwide. If you're convicted or acquitted in one state, you can still be tried in another state for the same crime. Different jurisdictions can charge the same individual with the same crime based on the same facts without violating double jeopardy. But, in this case it wouldn't have been double jeopardy anyway because it would've been a different murder under a different set of circumstances. So, a movie that was already suffering effectively sank itself with an ill-conceived plot.Libby served her time, got out of the Ritz-Carlton of prisons, and checked into a halfway house. That's where she met U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard... er excuse me... her parole officer Travis (Tommy Lee Jones). When she violated the conditions of her halfway house stay and was threatened with prison again, she went on the lam and Tommy Lee Jones did what he does best: chase fugitives. Since when does a parole officer track down parolees, and state to state no less?!? I thought I was watching ""The Fugitive 3"" (""U.S. Marshals"" was part two).This movie was outrageous and the main character did nothing for me. It's not that I don't like Ashley Judd, she was good in ""Kiss the Girls,"" it's just that, for whatever reason, she didn't resonate here. There was something about her character the entire time that was lacking. She always looked like a school marm trying to play fugitive. It was a really bad fit.

It is basically The Fugitive starring a woman. Ashley Judd is sentenced to six years in prison for the murder of her husband. Her prints are found on the weapon yet she claims innocence. Her son is kept under supervision but one call leads to the suspicion that her husband isn't dead after all. This all boils down to revenge fantasy outcome. Director Bruce Beresford does his best but his cast travel familiar territory. Judd is playing Harrison Ford in drag and adds absolutely nothing new to the premise other than being a woman. After released she searches for answers and we all know where that leads. Tommy Lee Jones is ideal because he pursued Ford in The Fugitive, so he can merely recite. Bruce Greenwood as her so-called deceased husband is indeed despicable and nearly kills her. He will be placed in a difficult position when rendered to a choice. It is unfortunate that one of those choices wasn't choosing a different script to act in. Annabeth Gish plays Judd's friend whom she leaves her son with. This role is small yet pivotal and hopeless.

25,JamesHitchcock,Film Making By Numbers,4,23 August 2005,"At the beginning of this film the heroine, Libby Parsons, is leading such an ideally happy life- a handsome, wealthy husband, a young son, a beautiful home set in magnificent scenery in Washington State- that we just know that she is headed for disaster. The crisis comes when she and her husband Nick are spending one weekend together on their yacht. Libby wakes up to find herself covered in blood and Nick missing. To make matters worse she is arrested and charged with his murder, the presumed motive being to profit from his life insurance. Although no body is ever found, Libby is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Libby comes to suspect that Nick is still alive, that he faked his own death and that he framed her for the crime in order to start a new life under a false name with her best friend Angela, to whom Libby entrusted the care of her son.The title ""Double Jeopardy"" relates to the rule of law which states that the same defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. It normally relates to situations where a defendant has already been acquitted of a crime, and means that he cannot be tried again for that crime even if fresh evidence of his guilt comes to light later. It also means that a defendant who has been convicted of an offence and punished cannot be re-tried and given a second punishment. The film-makers here, however, seek to give the doctrine a radically new interpretation. It is seriously suggested (by two characters who are supposedly legally qualified) that Libby, having been convicted of a crime which never actually took place, is now at liberty to commit that same crime in reality- in other words she has a licence to seek her husband and kill him.This is not an interpretation which any lawyer would place on the double jeopardy rule. (I note that no legal adviser is listed in the credits). I wondered if the film-makers had simply found an impressive legal-sounding title (possibly inspired by the classic film noir ""Double Indemnity"", which concerns a woman who actually does murder her husband for insurance money) and then tried to concoct a plot which would fit it. Certainly, Libby, on being released on parole, does try and track Nick down, but we are never sure if she really does intend to kill him or merely wants to be reunited with her son. The novel legal doctrine is never actually put to the test in court.The obvious lack of care taken with the legal aspects of a crime thriller is symptomatic of what is wrong with this film. The whole thing is a derivative example of film-making-by-numbers, full of implausibilities and plot-holes. Why does Nick evolve such a complex plot in order to arrange his own disappearance? Why was a woman convicted of such a bloody murder given parole after only six years in jail? How does Libby manage to escape so easily from her probation officer? Why does he follow her all the way from Washington State to New Orleans to try and track her down after she jumps parole rather than leave that task to the police? The answer in each case is simply because the plot requires it.It was doubtless a blow to the filmmakers when Jodie Foster had to withdraw from the film due to her pregnancy, but I doubt if even an actress as gifted as she could have saved this film. The main problem is not the acting (all the actors, including Jodie's replacement Ashley Judd, were perfectly adequate) but the implausible plot and creaking script. Tommy Lee Jones has given some good performances in films such as ""The Fugitive"" and ""Heaven and Earth"", but here, as Libby's alcoholic probation officer (and a former law professor)he seems wasted.The director Bruce Beresford is one of those foreign-born directors who seem to get trapped in a rut on moving to Hollywood. In his native Australia he was responsible for some original and challenging films such as ""Breaker Morant"", an intelligent exploration of the morality of war; since moving to America in the 1980s he has made some good films (notably ""Driving Miss Daisy"")but too much of his output is standard formulaic Hollywood fare. ""Double Jeopardy"" falls firmly into that category. 4/10",Double Jeopardy
26,OllieSuave-007,Double the suspense.,7,31 March 2014,"Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd team up in a story where happily married Libby Parsons (Judd) finds her financial-troubled husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) missing. An investigation leads to the conviction of Libby for murdering Nick to obtain the insurance policy he had. While in prison, Libby learns Nick is still alive and had framed her. Therefore, after being paroled she escapes probation officer Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) to look for Nick, with Travis hot on her trail.This movie combines the tension of Judd's ""Kiss The Girls"" and Jones' ""The Fugitive"" to provide a movie that is double the mystery and suspense, captivating an audience and keeping the movie's momentum strong. The tension builds in one scene after the other to its action-packed climax, from the moment Libby finds her husband missing to her struggling to cope in prison, and to her avoiding her probation officer to her attempting to track down her husband.Movie may be a little predictable, and some of the plot elements are the same as the TV movie ""Bitter Vengeance,"" which stars Bruce Greenwood playing a character that also escapes, fakes his murder, and frames his wife. But overall, this is another nice popcorn movie for a night.Grade B-",Double Jeopardy
27,sddavis63,Double Jeopardy? I Think Not!,5,13 July 2008,"I admit that I'm no lawyer, but I do think that I understand the concept of double jeopardy and frankly, the title of this movie (and the scenario around which it revolves) just doesn't ring true. There's no secret here, so I might as well lay it on the line. The whole premise here is that Libby is convicted of murdering her husband, but was actually set up by him. She goes to prison, he assumes a new identity. She gets told that once she gets out she can just seek him out and kill him and no one can do anything about it because she's already been tried for his murder and can't be again. Double jeopardy. Wait a minute! Double jeopardy means not being tried for the same crime twice, but surely if he's still alive and she murders him again that's a different crime. She can't be tried for the killing on the boat again but anything else is fair game. So, that just really irritated me the whole way through and made the premise of the movie ridiculous.As to the rest of the movie, quite honestly it came across to me as a sort of Saturday afternoon made for TV movie (except that it was big screen), with a bit of a silly plot and performances that were average at best. In a way it's sort of a remake of ""The Fugitive,"" with Ashley Judd playing Libby, the convicted murderer on the run trying to prove her innocence, and Tommy Lee Jones as Travis - as in ""The Fugitive"" a law enforcement official (this time a parole officer) out to get her. There isn't anything particularly special about this. At best - 5/10",Double Jeopardy

You'll probably keep watching to ""see what happens"" but what happens isn't much different than a hastily shot television drama. Ashley Judd is excellent if not transcendent here as the leading character, and she plays a variety of kinds of woman (the same woman, but in very different circumstances). Tommi Lee Jones is excellent and not transcendent, as well, and is only in parts of the second half in a role that's sort of too familiar if you've seen the much better ""The Fugitive.""So what gives it anything worth the mutton? A promise of clarity and retribution. Judd is accused, we assume incorrectly, of killing her husband. The authorities decide to go along and throw her in jail for six years for murder even though there is no body.Naturally it's not so simple. And the pursuit, after her release, is part revenge and part, ""Oh, come on."" What it lacks in believability it tries to make up for in excess (the cars on the ferry for a start). Give Judd credit, she makes the most of the action. She is steely and determined in a way we like. She's our hero, after all.The sensational follows the unlikely and eventually all is resolved, with a couple last unimpressive twists. Yeah, you get the idea, it's about the twisting and not the terrible fact that this woman lost years of her life and can't get back together with her son.

32,Ed-Shullivan,Should be re-classified as a Science-Fiction,6,13 March 2020,"I like both Ashley Judd, and Tommy Lee Jones body of work and this film reflects positively on them as does Bruce Greenwood's performance as the deceiving and corrupt husband. Ashley Judd plays Libby, the wife of a well-to-do husband Nick, (Bruce Greenwood) who has been deceiving everyone regarding his financial stability. In his efforts to circumvent the debt collectors who are circling like vultures on a fresh but dead carcass and to refresh his negative balance bank account Nick establishes a plan that requires his wife Libby and him to purchase a sailboat, where he will be perceived as being murdered by his wife Libby and thrown overboard, never to be seen again. Libby's sister Angie (Annabeth Gish) is the one person that Libby can depend upon to take care of her young son while her trial for first degree murder of her husband proceeds through the court system.After Libby is found responsible for her husband Nick's murder, she is sentenced to a long prison term. While in prison Libby discovers that not only is Nick alive but he has cashed in on his own life insurance policy by having Libby's sister Angie who was entrusted with the care and upbringing of her own son, by shaking up with Nick and in the middle of the night moving to another city under an alias name.Libby tales refuge in prison with a few other savvy female prisoners who help Libby stay both physically and mentally in shape in an effort to someday get out of prison and then kill her husband Nick, by which she cannot be tried twice for his murder. Thus the movie title, Double Jeopardy.I consider it a science-fiction genre film because the plot has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Tommy Lee Jones plays Libby's parole officer who requires a lot of convincing by Libby and others of her innocence in the crime of murder that she was wrongly found guilty of committing, before he eventually realizes that he must assist Libby in solving the real crime initiated by Libby's conniving husband Nick.It's worth a watch, but just be aware that it's not a realistic plot that Nick can simply change his name, deceive the insurance company on a million dollar plus life insurance policy, and hide in plain sight with no repercussions by the courts and/or the criminal justice system.I give it a 6 out of 10 rating due to strong performances by Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, Bruce Greenwood, and Annabeth Gish.",Double Jeopardy

34,Anonymous_Maxine,Thanks God for Tommy Lee Jones.,7,7 May 2001,"Double Jeopardy is an interesting enough thriller, but it just isn't as satisfying as you would expect a movie with this premise to be. Ashley Judd is just annoying for the first hour or so of the film, and it isn't until the fugitive style chase begins that the movie gets really interesting. And this, of course, is where Tommy Lee's excellent acting is the most entertaining and fun. He has unfortunately been somewhat typecast since his spectacular performance in The Fugitive, but at least he has been typecast in a role that is always fun to watch and that he can always pull off excellently.I think it's pointless to try to argue whether or not the whole double jeopardy law can truly be handled in the way that it was described in the film, but as a crime film Double Jeopardy was pretty good. Judd's husband in the film is one of those characters that's easy to hate, and not only because of what he did in the movie. You just look at this guy and you immediately don't like him. That's good casting, but it also completely voided any effectiveness that his `auction' might ever have had. And how about that coffin scene! Who cares that no one gets buried in a coffin that has plenty of room for two! That was one of the creepiest things I've seen in a movie in years.Clearly, there is nothing spectacular about Double Jeopardy. It's not going to win any awards and it probably won't be remembered for very long. But it has a certain charm that can unfortunately only be appreciated if you're in the right state of mind when you watch it. Don't expect it to be as good as The Fugitive just because Tommy Lee Jones is in it (really, are any movies as good as The Fugitive?). I mean, let's face it, Double Jeopardy isn't even as good as Under Siege, but as far as a moderately entertaining crime thriller to kill a couple hours, you could definitely do a lot worse.",Double Jeopardy

If not in the hands of two great actors, Judd, so believable and engaging to watch here, while Jones does solid as always, this movie could of well shrunk. I did find it, so predictable from the start, I'm not surprised, Bruce Greenwood, a really good actor, who always delivers (can't believe he was in 87's flop, The Bikini Shop) didn't wear a sign, saying ""I'm the bad guy"". Judd who plays a lot of strong independent characters, yet gives us another, of a woman framed for the murder of her husband (Greenwood), where foul plays involved. After doing her time, a six year stint, which is lessened, by working off her remaining three at a halfway house, run by a cranky, hardfisted ex lush (Jones) she sets off on a path of revenge to make wrongs right: find Greenwood and get her son back. She can actually kill Greenwood in cold blood, as she's already been convicted once already of killing him, where prefore, to her doing her three year parole stint, wearied down, she had finally, falsely convinced to killing Greenwood. Could this double jeopardy law really be possible in reality? Is this just American Law? If it is, Judd should of carried through, and killed the fu..er. I would. Like other movies, at that speech near the end, you really savor these vengeful moments with ecstasy, where villain and victim meet, as you really think what he/she, put her/him through, where the total lack of feelings from these scumbags who cause havoc, and misery in peoples lives (again note, Judd's so believable acting of emotions) is sickening. There is a kind of down note to Greenwood's fate, where dying instead of suffering, is an injustice, that really sucks, where if the other had happened, that again, would of been another painfully predictable, if cliché'd moment.

Umm.. Wrong! With a premise like that, the credibility of the movie goes way out the window. The legal term 'double jeopardy' means one cannot be convicted of exactly the same crime twice, not just the charge. If I were accused of killing a man at 8:30 in a bookstore in New York on November 13, 1996, then I can never again be convicted of killing that man at that time in that place on that date. All of the specifics need to be the same, not just the ""I killed a man"" part. But obviously, since so many people watched and liked this movie, the actual veracity of the plot is mostly immaterial. My personal opinion is that with so many rotten ex-husbands in the world, any movie in which one gets killed TWICE is going to make beaucoup bucks! So forget the implausible plot and focus on the action and the drama. Ashley Judd is Libby Parsons, the accused woman in question. Judd turns in another of her fine performances as a woman who will do almost anything to get back to her young son, who of course was taken by the seedy husband. Tommy Lee Jones is her parole officer (!) who seems like a bit of a jerk at the start, but lo and behold comes to believe in her cause. Actually, Tommy Lee's character is a little tough to figure out. Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy? Does he have ulterior motives?

Also, escaping from custody is a felony in most states, and being innocent of the crime one is escaping over is not a defense to the charge of escape.

For the happy ending to occur, it seems to me that there would have to be pardons issued by the governors of at least 3 states.

48,Spleen,Never accept legal advice from a fellow prisoner.,7,16 January 2001,"Yes, common law does contain a ""double jeopardy"" principle: one cannot be tried for the same crime twice.  A friend of mine who knows something about legal theory (I know next to nothing) points out that one can nevertheless face the same CHARGE twice.  If I am convicted of stealing Fred's car it's just not true that the law can't touch me if I steal his car a second time - in the eyes of the law, which is not a complete ass, I have committed TWO crimes, even though they both bear the same description: `stealing Fred's car'.Let us suppose, though, that it's different in the case of murder, at least in some jurisdiction somewhere.  (It's easy to see why murder might be a special case.)  Suppose that Libby Parsons, falsely convicted of killing Nick Parsons, now has the legal right to REALLY kill him.  What of it? Murder is the ONLY crime Libby is at legal liberty to commit; but how does one commit ONLY murder? It's just not possible.  In order to murder Mick, Libby must break any number of other laws: she must inflict grievous bodily harm, or damage property, or endanger someone's safety, or carry a concealed firearm, or create a public nuisance, or loiter, or jaywalk - I'm sure there are enough laws on the books to keep her locked away from precisely as long as if she'd simply been convicted of murder a second time, and a good thing too.It's hard not to think of this when she JUMPS PAROLE in order to go in search of her presumed-dead husband.  What's the point of this detail?  The film wants to wave what it supposes to be a clever gimmick in our faces: the fact that Libby can commit murder within the law.  If she then breaks a law - which she needn't have done, and which the film certainly needn't have been constructed so as to make it the case that she needed to have done - what's the POINT of the double jeopardy routine?  I don't know that there was much point anyway.  Do we really want this woman to break out of jail and murder her husband?  Of course not.  We like her.  She's not yet a killer and we don't want her to become one, even if killing her husband is in her interest, which it isn't.  This would have been a better film if Beresford had at some point halfway through made it clear to us that the ""legal principle"" Libby had heard from her friend in jail was but a distortion of the truth.Anyway: this bugged me.  But it's not to say that ""Double Jeopardy"" isn't otherwise a well-made thriller, distinctly enjoyable to watch.  It has Tommy Lee Jones doing his schtick, for one thing.  I actually prefer his character here to the one he bore in ""The Fugitive"".  Everyone remembers his reply in the earlier film to ""I didn't kill my wife"": ""I don't care.""

While in prison for 6 years for ""killing her husband,"" she finds out, accidentally, that her husband is alive and well! When she gets out, her plan is revenge and getting her son back. Jones, her parole officer, must capture her for leaving ""past curfew."" This makes for Judd not only the hunter, but the hunted.Outstanding performances by Judd and Jones highlight this film, along with some nice touches by Beresford in keeping the tension high while moving it along at just the right pace. Judd makes Libby believable, infused with a vulnerability and determination that makes you pull for her; she's a strong woman who's been wronged, and you desperately want to see her get her life put back together. Jones is convincing as the hard-as-nails Lehman, who doesn't see parole as a second chance, but as a ""last"" chance. Beneath it all, however, you know that this is a man who also believes in justice, and will do what he can to make it so. Greenwood gives just the right touch of boorishness to Nick; he's like the successful used-car salesman you never want to have to deal with, and you wait for the moment when Libby will finally get her crack at him. The supporting cast includes Annabeth Gish (Angela), Michael Gaston (Cutter), Roma Maffia (Margaret) and Davenia McFadden (Evelyn). In a world in which the unjust too often prevail, it is gratifying to at least see the attempt made of putting things to right. ""Double Jeopardy"" does just that; it takes you on a wild ride and gives you hope at the same time. Maybe it's only a movie, but it's a good one.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Double Jeopardy
53,philip_vanderveken,Did I write this script?,5,26 November 2004,"Double Jeopardy is typical Hollywood kitsch. It's a TV-movie, specially made for housewives who probably haven't got much else to do but watching a tearjerker or two each day, next to their favorite soap opera's of course.Hollywood seems to have a formula for this kind of movies which is used time after time. Normally they haven't got a cast with any known actors in it and then they call it a TV-movie, but this time they were able to get Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones for their movie. Not that it helped the movie to get to a higher level. It's still incredibly predictable.It all starts with the perfect little family. Man, wife and one kid who all live together as happy as possible. They've got a beautiful house at the beach and are going to buy a sailing boat. Of course they first want to make a little trip with it to be sure. And than it all happens. They have a little party and get drunk. Later at night she wakes up, her husband is missing and she is covered with his blood. She finds a knife on the deck and picks it up. Of course the coast guard spots her exactly on the moment that she's got the knife in her hand. His body is never found but they do find out that he had a life insurance worth 2 million dollar. She is convicted of murdering him and has to go to jail. Because she is no longer able to take care of her son, she asks a friend to adopt him. After a few months she never sees him again... her friend has moved and didn't let her know where they are now. She finds out that her husband isn't dead, that he lives with her friend and her son in San Fransisco... She's furious now and wants her kid back and wants to take revenge on her husband... which is exactly what she will do the day she is free on parole. What follows is a catch-me-if-you-can game between her, her husband and her parole officer which is so predictable that you think you wrote everything yourself. Of course she finds him, kills her husband and is reunited with her kid who doesn't ask too many questions about the fact that his mommy came back from the death to rescue him out of the claws of his evil dad...My advice to every person that likes a good thriller: only watch it when you are able to switch off your brain for a couple of hours. Otherwise you'll be annoyed by all the flaws in the script and the many sugar sweet moments. The only thing I liked was the funeral with the brass band in New Orleans, that was really cool to watch.

The great performance of Ashley Judd should have been the Oscar for her. It was a good cat and mouse story. It shows also a very emotional relation ship between mother and the missing son with plenty of love for both. This was perhaps the biggest touching scene. It is perhaps predictable but worth watching. It offers many plots and twists and the movie is shot in very nice areas. Another DVD for my best of collection. Rating: 7/10.,Double Jeopardy

Libby is happily married and living in the Seattle area with her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood), and their four-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir).  Nick, however, is in big financial trouble, and they are about to lose everything; and Libby knows nothing about it.  Under pretense of buying her a boat, Nick takes Libby sailing, alone.  During the night he disappears, leaving behind evidence of his apparent murder, and orchestrating it to incriminate Libby. When she is convicted and sent to prison, Matty goes to stay with a family friend, Angela (Annabeth Gish), who disappears with the boy a month later. Adamant in her quest to locate Angela by tracking her through a series of phone numbers, she finally succeeds; and also discovers that Nick is still alive.  And with Angela.  Frustrated in her attempts to get someone to listen to her story, Libby can do nothing but serve her time, and wait. After serving six years in prison, she is paroled, and begins searching for her son, armed with a useful bit of information she learned on the inside: The law of Double Jeopardy; since she's already been convicted of killing her husband, she cannot be tried for it again, even if she shoots him in front of a crowd in the middle of Times Square.

It is more about a woman who loses her son and tries to get him back after getting out of jail. This however does not mean the film is bad, on the contrary, it is good and I can very much recommend you to go and watch it. It has nothing to do with someone really being in Jeopardy or something as the title suggests (doesn't it sound like a cheap action flick's title?). But maybe that is because I'm foreign, but hey the title of the film is explained and after that I understood better what this film was about.
The fact that this movie is good is especially to be credited to Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd, who make great performances in that film. Tommy Lee Jones is kind of funny in his very own way and Ashley Judd is just so believable I can't believe it. For it does often happen that when someone cries in a movie I think, OH MY GOD, this sucks, the actor stinks, not with her. The whole acting the motives, everything is convincing and real.

64,RonellSowes,Half Thought Out Film,5,7 March 2021,"A woman, Libby(Judd), is sent to prison on charges that she murdered her husband. When in fact he actually faked his death and then took off with their son to start a new life. But when Libby gets out on parole, she's driven by a rage to find him and sheilded due to double-jeopardy laws. Or so this film would have you believe. Double jeopardy means you cant be tried for the same crime twice, but that doesn't mean you suddenly have a free pass. However, this is merely the first in a long line of inaccuracies and holes in the film. Nearly every action Libby takes doesn't hold up to the mildest scrutiny and only works if you think it through one way. I won't bother listing them all, as there are too many, but collectively they certainly detract from the overall entertainment. It trades logic for thrills and in doing so, loses most of its intensity. A sharp contrast from a film it tries to imitate, The Fugitive. Both feature someone who is wrongfully convicted of killing their spouse, and are being pursued by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones recieved a merited Oscar for his role in the 1993 Best Picture nominee, which launched his career. And he also happens to be the best thing in both. Except The Fugitive is far better film and certainly didn't need rely on his performance as much as this film does.

First came ""U.S. Marshals,"" in 1998, which, like ""The Fugitive,"" detailed an innocently convicted man tracking down his enemies and starred Tommy Lee Jones. Now there's ""Double Jeopardy,"" which contains a plot so close to the other two, its a shame the filmmakers had to go and break tradition with generating this film an R-rating. Neither of the other two films were this coarse, and that's the only thing keeping ""Double Jeopardy,"" on its own level of comparison.The movie opens by introducing the happily married couple Nick and Libby Parsons, who seemingly has it all; a wealthy living style, a well-behaved nine year old son named Bobby, a strong matrimony, and even a great big sail boat that Nick recently borrowed for Libby and is ready to purchase for her. In the heat of the decision, the two of them arrange a baby-sitter, long time friend Angie, to watch Bobby for the night while they have the time of their life exploring the waters nearby.Everything looks wonderful from the sailboat. The waters calm and the sky clear. Libby and Nick go under deck when night falls. The two of them relax, make love, and then go to bed. When Libby wakes up hours afterwards, the entire sailboat is covered with blood, showing signs of a struggle. The boat is deserted, with her being the one on board. Where's Nick? What happened?
Libby will have plenty time to think about these things when she is accused of murdering her husband with a knife. She is wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison, where she learns that her husband is off living another life with Angie and Bobby, and the two million dollars in insurance money. She then learns of the concept of ""double jeopardy,"" from a jail mate. It is the fifteenth amendment on the constitution. The prisoner explains to Libby that the state already said that she killed her husband, so if she gets out of prison, and actually kills him, regardless of how many witnesses or the evidence, she can't be charged twice with the same crime. This is exactly what Libby intends to do.""Double Jeopardy"" has a perfect setup in the structure and story. The first act is pretty solid and confident. The scenes relate to each other and are well constructed.  The external problem is the seemingly murderous act against her husband. The internal problem has to do with her missing son. Proper complications follow the conflict, such as Libby's prison sentence, the discovery of her husbands secret plans, her parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) and his strict rules which are broken, her escape, all that build up to a rather predictable, but admirable, conclusion.The film runs into trouble in the second act. The story turns from skillful setup to scene after scene of Libby and her parole officer, Lehman, chasing each other. ""The Fugitive"" got away with that, and I am not necessarily saying that ""Double Jeopardy"" is a total failure in its chase sequences. The scenes are well made and somewhat exciting. But it is a shame to see such a wonderful first act lead to such a conventional story line.
The are many good qualities and bad qualities about Bruce Beresford's suspense thriller. The take off in the second act is full of excitement and high energy. The sailboat scene, where Libby awakens to a bloody mess in the middle of the night with her husband missing, is really suspenseful--but there is no momentum build up. The trials in which Libby is charged with are one sided, making perfectly clear that the film is going somewhere unexpected. The scene where Libby learns of her husband's secret life on the phone in prison is a golden moment, as is the slammer atmosphere altogether. There is a nice production design involved with the film as well. But what about the $10,000 Libby spends on clothes as she confronts Nick for the first time in years? That is the question I kept asking myself throughout the third act.The performing talents existing in ""Double Jeopardy"" only prove what a shame it is that the characters aren't better understood or developed. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get to do much here except chase Libby. Not to mention the fact that his character is developed through situations, rumors, dialogue and personality clashes, never being introduced to us appropriately. This is not a major catastrophe, and to some extent, under the circumstances, kind of effective--but his performance is never anything he is capable of producing with a better developed script.Ashley Judd's performance and character is a different story. Her character is entirely realized and empathized with. From her motives to the increasingly dramatic situations she is faced with, all offer profoundness and realism. One big problem, however, is the intelligence  of her character, which seems to vary from scene to scene. For example, in one incident she might be so cleaver and tricky that her keen senses can associate troubles nearby. While in others, she is prone to walk right into an obvious trap. The key in developing profound characters is keeping them profound throughout the entire production,  and the way to do that is consistency.Even if ""Double Jeopardy"" wasn't a virtual clone of ""The Fugitive,"" however, it would probably have failed still. You see, the movie's individual scenes seem fragmented and scattered.  Like ""Stigmata,"" the production has a hard time fitting together in order to make a good overall piece of work. So, no, even if you haven't seen or heard about ""The Fugitive"" or ""U.S. Marshals,"" this film still isn't worth seeing. Sorry--a close call in my case, but no recommendation here.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.",Double Jeopardy
66,FlickJunkie-2,Enormous credibility problems,5,25 February 2000,"This film has so many plot flaws that I spent most of the movie screaming at the screen, `Oh, come on, you can't expect me to believe THAT!'  The basic premise is flawed.  Even if the double jeopardy law allowed Libby (Ashley Judd) to kill her husband without penalty after serving her time (which it doesn't), she would still go back to jail for parole violations (possession of a weapon among other things).  The plot line is threadbare from overuse. This is a cross between `The Fugitive' and `The Pelican Brief';  innocent girl chasing after the bad guy while everyone is chasing after her.
This film asks the viewer to leap chasm after chasm of incredulity.  Let's examine some of the malarkey they ask us to swallow.  Do they expect us to believe that Libby wakes up covered with blood, sees a knife on the deck and doesn't expect foul play?  Is there anyone on the planet stupid enough to pick up the knife and make themselves the prime murder suspect?  When she's in jail and suspects that her husband is alive, why isn't she calling her lawyer, the prosecutor, the press and anyone else she knows who could hire a private investigator to find him?  When Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) caught her, are we really supposed to believe that he would leave his keys in the car with her inside?  And after she crashed four times into other cars and knocked one off the back of the ferry, no one noticed?  And my favorite; why didn't Nick (Bruce Greenwood) strangle her before stuffing her in the coffin with her knapsack with the gun in it?  Even if he had forgotten that Travis told him that Libby had a gun, don't tell me he couldn't feel the weight of a handgun in the knapsack.Tommy Lee Jones was out of gas in this film.  Between `The Fugitive', `US Marshals', and this, he has played the same character in the same situation so many times in succession that he has grown flaccid from boredom. Ashley Judd was actually excellent, and was the only reason to see the film.  Her athleticism as well as her intensity impressed me.  It is seldom that you will see a female actress agree to do her own stunts, especially one that involves escaping from a submerged vehicle.Acclaimed director Bruce Beresford proves that a big budget, bankable stars and talented filming cannot save a trashy script.  The filming of this movie was technically excellent, containing good suspense, thrilling stunt work, great chase scenes and plenty of plot twists.  But Beresford must have decided that all the plot holes didn't matter, since he didn't demand rewrites.  So I place the blame for this tripe squarely in his lap.I think I was being generous in rating this film a 5/10.

In No Country for Old Men, he's a washed up cop sitting in a café philosophizing about nothing, doesn't solve crimes, then retires, a real sleep inducer. What a crappy movie.Anyway, here we have Judd and her supposed acting. I've seen the scene where she's by a waterfront and her friend walks out of a cop car and informs her that she will be arrested for her husband's death. What does she do and say? She says ""not in front of my kid"". What a pile of garbage. If you were just going to be arrested for the death of your spouse, is that what you would say? First off, you probably wouldn't be anywhere near the waterfront where your husband supposedly died. How about showing some trauma? How about something to the effect that she can't believe what has happened? Is that too much to expect from acting?There's a scene in the jail where another inmate, I guess an x lawyer, telling Judd that she can kill her husband and the law can't do anything about it because they can't charge her for the same crime. Yeah, ok! Next we see her lifting weights, running in the rain and snow, trying to show us (The Dumb Audience) that she is getting physically ready to kill her husband. Another inmate say something to the effect that she's tough. What a pile of trash.Then they release her. She was convicted of killing her husband and she's out. How does that work? What follows is more paint by numbers scenes, spoon feeding The Dumb Audience, all the info we need to make sense of this trash. She's at a halfway house run by Jones.

70,chrisbrown6453,"Even besides the fact that the entire premise of Double Jeopardy was legally flawed, the movie still stunk.",6,21 May 2002,"Bad acting, bad writing, and of course the legal flaws, almost made this movie unbearable to watch. If not for the looks of Ashley Judd I may have actually walked out. Notice I said looks, not acting ability.
Judd plays Libby Parsons, a woman with a young son and a successful husband. But one night while on board a small boat, she wakes up to find her husband missing, and herself accused of killing him. After being convicted of his murder and being sent to prison, she finds out that he's still alive. So when she gets out on parole 6 years later, she sets out to find her husband, kill the b**tard, and get back her son. I suppose written that way, the movie doesn't sound too terrible. But the name of the movie is Double Jeopardy. As we all know, either from actual knowledge or watching enough cop and lawyer movies, double jeopardy means that you can't be tried for the same crime twice. There are exceptions of course, but in simple English, that's it. So while in prison, a compassionate murderer tells Libby that since she's already been convicted of her husband's murder, she can rightfully go kill and him there's nothing the government can do. Well all I have to say to that is WRONG!!!First, since she didn't really kill him the first time, if she kills him for real, she's not really being tried for the same crime. Different act, different circumstances, different murder. Second of all, she was initially convicted in Washington state. If she kills him in another state, she can be convicted in that state since the two states are separate sovereigns. Third, she could be tried in federal court for Civil Rights violations (think Rodney King beating). Also, if you have a $2 million insurance policy on your husband, with you as a beneficiary, if you kill him, you're NOT getting the money! No insurance company would pay you for that, it's ridiculous even thinking about it. How many more people would kill their spouses if they knew once they got out of jail they're have money waiting for them? And how the hell is she out on parole after only 6 years? Every time a legal issue was brought up it was brought up wrong and it annoyed me more and more. I am the king of suspending beliefs when going to see a movie, but when the main plot point, the title of the damn film, is flawed, it burns me.
So, you might ask, all that legal stuff aside, how was the film? Well, it still stunk. Ashley Judd may be one of the most beautiful actresses working today, but I never realized until now how lousy an actor she is. None of her emotions and facial expressions ever matched the scene she was in. Her range as an actress needs to be expanded somehow before I could ever believe that she was capable of any of what happened in this film. And the dialogue? A sampling: ""Do you know who I am honey?"" ""They told me you were dead."" ""No, I'm not."" As a friend of mine said, If I were 10 years old, and someone I was told was dead all of a sudden turned up at my soccer game, I'd be running the other way in a hurry. The scenes in prison seemed unrealistic. I've never been in a women's prison before, but I can't believe a bunch of murderers, female or not, are going around baking cakes for each other. Tommy Lee Jones was the only saving grace in this film and he wasn't even in it that much.So overall, I thought Double Jeopardy was a waste of time. I apologize if this review sounds biased based on a flawed legal premise, but I think even if I was able to get past that, the movie was still bad.

The last couple of years when we did that we frequently got a DVD as a ""bonus"" with it and this is one of those. According to my movie collection database we have had it since 2008 and last evening we finally got around watching it.This is a quite okay movie. It will not blow your socks off but it is fairly okay and worth watching. It is a nice thriller/fugitive style movie to watch on a middle-of-the-week evening. I would probably not have been impressed had I gone to a theater to watch it but watching it as a TV-movie it was quite enjoyable. There are the usual silly moments that tend to be in these kinds of movies of course, starting with the stupid wife who just has to pick up the bloody knife just before the police arrives. Why do all (most) script writers have to put that crap into every movie? I do generally like Tommy Lee Jones even though he tends to look and act pretty much the same no matter which movie he is in. I guess I like stability. The plot is okay. It is a fairly conventional husband frames wife, wife goes after husband kind of story and does not really provide any surprises.One thing that caught my attention was that the car dealer apparently could do a credit check on a woman that was, as was found out later in the movie, dead since three years. I think someone missed the QA-checking of the script in terms of credibility there but then, as I said, the movie will not blow your socks of and the plot is fairly standard Hollywood fare with the usual silly stuff in it.",Double Jeopardy

As she starts doing some detective work of her own, she discovers her husband is indeed alive and was behind this horrible act. Trouble is, her investigation work is retarded by her parole officer, Tommy Lee Jones. The good news though is that if she finds him, she can blow his brains out and not be charged for murder. Sweet!

When Libby comes up on the top, she notices a bloody knife; but no Nick. As soon as Libby picks up the knife, the Coast Guard arrives. Once back on shore all the evidence points that she has murdered Nick. She is arrested for Nicks murder, when this happens she meets with her friend Angie( Annabeth Gish). She explains to Angie that she would like her to take Mattie until this gets straightened out. A trial begins for Libby, and she is tried and convicted for the murder of Nick.Libby is sent to prison, her closest parole date in 6 years away. While in prison she gets close to two inmates, Margaret(Roma Maffia) and Evelyn(Davenia McFadden). Libby knows something is not right, she suspect something; and Angie is involved? Libby tries to get a hold of Angie and can't. While doing some investigating she finds out Angie has moved to San Francisco, and Nick is still alive. After the call she talks to Margaret and Evelyn. Margaret was an attorney who was convicted of murdering her husband. She gives Libby great advice and explains to her about the rule of Double Jeopardy. A person can't be tried for the same crime twice. If Libby tracked Nick down she could kill him for real. The Law couldn't touch her because she's already be tried and convicted for that crime. She now realizes that she need to make parole, she has been set up. Nick has faked his death taken Angie and Mattie with him.It has been 6 years and Libby has made parole, she is sent now to a half-way house. There she meets Travis(Tommy Lee Jones). Travis is an ex-Law Professor who is now a parole officer. He is tough and only gives his parolees one shot. While on parolee Libby calls Angie, but realizes the phone has been disconnected. One night Libby gets arrested off the mainland. Travis arrives at the jail to take her back to prison. When they are on the ferry, Libby tries to escape. When the car goes into the water, Libby escapes by grabbing Travis's gun. Libby finds a new address in Colorado. Little does she know Travis following her. In Colorado Libby finds out Angie is dead due to a house explosion; and Nick is probably responsible. She does a search about the accident and notices a painting she and Nick had. Libby visits an art gallery and the painting was sold To a Nick Deveraux. Nick has changed his name and he is currently residing in New Orleans. While in the gallery she hears Travis's voice and bails. Libby is on her way to New Orleans, to find Nick. When she arrives in New Orleans she plays it cool and slyly. A bachelor's ball is being held at his hotel, and he is going to be auctioned off. To his surprise she catches up with him , but he has other plans for her. Meanwhile Travis arrives in New Orleans and begins to think Libby is innocent. Travis locates Deveraux, and informs him what is going on. Travis realizes now that this guy is dirty, and finally locates Libby. They both devise a plan and go back to the hotel. Unaware that Travis is taping the conversation, Nick tells him he has taken care of the problem. To Nick's surprise Libby walks out holding Travis's gun. It's done they have Nick on tape for an attempted murder of Libby. Nick goes to prison, Libby is reunited with her son, and She & Travis save each other emotionally.I enjoyed this film, a great story about a cruel husband who almost sends his wife over the edge.

Yes there are a few alterations, but it's a vaguely similar plot with Tommy Lee Jones trying to find the person on the run again. But despite these similarities, Double Jeopardy is an above average (if not predictable) cat-and-mouse thriller.
The lead role goes to Ashley Judd who plays a woman trying to find her son after being imprisoned for six years, though she didn't seem to age at all, and find her husband who framed her. Judd gives her breakthrough performance and is quite convincing aswell. She got the role when a pregnant Jodie Foster pulled out (who would have delivered the role with equal oomph). Tommy Lee Jones plays the parole officer/policeman trying to track her down (does that not seem a tad familiar). He's standard for the part but didn't exactly jump off the screen. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat up until the end, but after watching it you'll probably instantly forget it. There's nothing really wrong with the film, but it's just not very memorable.

I don't have my sister's memory, not exactly, but I have retained a sense for the film's cool, calculated and rightful retribution which is something singularly satisfying when done well. Double Jeopardy is not The Count of Monte Cristo but it does have a large degree of that savor with a similar situation of wrongful imprisonment of an innocent by a posh and malicious never-do-well for the sake of greed and a taste of the lavish. If you are a fan of the classic tale of revenge in Count I do think you will enjoy this twist in Double Jeopardy as a legal thriller, because like Dantes the protagonist is good looking, charming and well-liked but naive, and later becomes a cunning and vengeful survivor.Solid film, well constructed and good pace with likable leads (Ashley Judd and Tommy's Lee Jones) and an antagonist you love to hate, who can be characterized as a handsome snake who owns a boat called ""Morning Star,"" the meaning behind the name Lucifer.There's not a lot of bad for me to say except according to Wikipedia it seems the legal premise or double jeopardy behind the film might be flawed here, or misleading.There also not anything particularly stellar to call out except that somehow despite being on possibly shaky ground everything seems convincing on an emotional level and because the characters play it off so well.

91,danielll_rs,"Dumb, implausible and everything in the in-between -- including entertaining",4,2 September 2000,"**GRADE: C+ / 59**WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SOME SPOILERSDOUBLE JEOPARDY is the kind of movie that leaves you with a feeling of emptiness after you watch it but, even with all its defects and stupidities, you feel entertained. That's my opinion, because that's how I felt. I understand why so many critics despised it and why so many moviegoers watched it and it became the biggest box office hit on North America spring, before the release of Oscar contenders. It has everything the critics hate: plot holes, clichés, factual mistakes, situations that would never happen in real life. And it has everything the big audiences like: superficial, harmless entertainment. But anyway it is entertainment. You may be thinking that I liked it very much because I was entertained, but I'm giving it a C+ and 59 out of 100, because this is not a great film by any stretch of thought, but also not an awful one. I would never praise and recommend it highly, but I wouldn't feel bad if I had to watch it again.
Almost every good action scenes and some plot twists were already revealed by the trailer, so I'm not spoiling when I resume the plot. Libby and Nick are a wealthy couple who live a perfect life with their child. However, this happiness is over after a night when Libby wakes up at their boat and finds blood everywhere and a knife, which she picks up (DUH!), but doesn't find her husband. After some investigations, she is blamed by his death (and of course we know she is innocent). She goes to prison, leaving her son with a friend, Angela. One day, Angela stops visiting her and she starts to search for her. She is living in another city and while his son is talking to her guess who arrives... Nick. The child mentions his name and Libby hears. Now she has a strong feeling of hate. One of the women on prison, who was once a lawyer, explains to her about double jeopardy. According to the lady, a person can't be considered guilty for the same crime twice. So Libby can kill her husband on Times Square and she won't go to prison again. Is that so easy like that???????? I guess not, but after six years Libby leaves the prison and is now by the responsibility of a state worker, Travis Lehman, whose job is to take female prisoners back to an ordinary life. But Libby won't give up of her revenging plan.With a story like that, DOUBLE JEOPARDY couldn't have been much better, but some situations could have been more difficult to happen. Libby does everything she plans. She travels by plane, finds Angela's new address, buys an expensive dress at a hotel store, saying that she is one of the hotel guests. And the cops never catch her. Situations like that are almost laughable. There is one that is the worst of the whole movie: Nick throws a thing at Libby's head and puts her into a coffin. When she wakes up, there is a body by her side, but (as a superhero) she can get out of the coffin just using her gun. Smart girl, uh? However, the biggest implausibility is about the double jeopardy law. I don't know almost anything about the Brazilian Penal Code, so what would I say about the American? But killing a person and be considered not guilty in a blink of eyes is just impossible. I can say the same about Nick's situation, who pretends that he is dead, changes his name a dozen of times and goes on with his life cheating everyone. I think that the writers should have studied these two situations deeper before writing a screenplay for a Hollywood film. American lawyers may have been even ashamed of this.The people who praised Ashley Judd's performance should also reconsider that. She is not awful, but has got much to learn. She was awful in her first films (HEAT, A TIME TO KILL), pretty bad in KISS THE GIRLS, quite better here. I can't say the same about Tommy Lee Jones, who has a good chemistry with Judd, even if they don't have an affair. Director Bruce Beresford does what he can. This is certainly much, much better than his last suspense effort: SILENT FALL, a muddled and almost unwatchable so-called mystery.The superficiality, the plot holes, the cliched, unbelievable and laughable situations, the sentimental ending and the trailer which showed everything that could have been considered as a plot twist make this film awful, right? No, just because it is fun to watch and never boring, a thing that doesn't happen in GONE IN 60 SECONDS, which is everything I said and also not fun and monotonous. I barely recommend DOUBLE JEOPARDY. It represents everything I like and hate about movies (attention! Movies, not films). It's better than I thought, but Hollywood should start to worry about factual errors in screenplays.",Double Jeopardy

103,WCS02,A riveting portrait of revenge,8,24 September 1999,"3 stars out of 4.  This is a riveting portrait of revenge.  The villain is up-to-date and bad; the heroine, cunning and driven by the reclamation of her son.  From the last frame to first, I was glued to the screen.  You will be too.Ever since Ashley Judd portrayed a crack whore in SMOKE, I've been smitten by her.  I tried not to let that persuade my judgement, so I confess to it up-front.  Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as always.  When you pair the two, I am bound to enjoy the outcome.  So in deference to my bias, I awarded 3 stars by starting with 4, then subtracting for flaws.The major flaw involves the prison environment.  Perhaps I've seen too many H.B.O. OZ episodes, but her subsequent ""parole halfway house"" seemed more prison-like than the prison depicted. After 6 years there, Libby (Ashley) seemed relatively unaffected by the experience.  I have to imagine ""cold-blooded murderess"" country clubs are few and far between in Washington state like anywhere else. . . . 1/2 a star, denied.Minor flaws accounted for another 1/4 star's deduction.  The cemetary coffin result was illogical to me (though admittedly possible.)  The trial scene was contrived yet critical to delivering an acceptable plot.  The unwinded elderly art dealer catching up the well-winded, younger Tommy Lee after his fugitive chase didn't make sense.  There are others, but you can see them for yourself.  Minor stuff  Nothing to impede your enjoyment: trust me!The ""cut to the chase"" scene following Ashley's burglary is top shelf. She's on foot vs. the police Jeep's pursuit through beach sand and surf.  It is unique and keeps the high tension on the wire. Terrific!All of the daytime Washington state outdoor photography is spectacular. 
The film is paced well and the scenes naturally fold from one to the other. I enjoyed this film in a relatively full theater.  We gasped, laughed and squealed in all the right places.  A handful even applauded at the end. (But I can't tell you why, obviously.  See for yourself)For those doing the ""star math"" en route to 3, I deducted a quarter for my bleary-eyed  acceptance of Ashley and Tommy Lee for matters confessed in the second paragraph above.

104,tml_pohlak_13,We find the defendant guilty...,2,10 June 2009,"Ashley Judd plays Libby, a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her husband, who, as it turns out, is still alive. Therefore, according to double jeopardy, once she gets out of prison, she can kill him and the law cannot punish her. Sound like a good premise for a fantastic thriller? That's what I thought. The result was a sore disappointment. Watching it in my law class, I noticed that I was more and more fascinated by my desk than the film.The film has its redeeming qualities: a rather neat stunt is pulled off on a ferry (it delivers minimal, if any, thrills, but is sort of neat), and a complicated car manoeuvre in traffic is successfully pulled off. The redeeming qualities end there.A huge complaint I have is the film's ridiculous premise. An inmate tells Libby about double jeopardy and how she can use it to her advantage, claiming she was a lawyer. I barely managed to refrain from bursting out laughing. Ridiculous! As someone with a slightly above average knowledge of law, the film's premise was ridiculous. You are tried in a court of law on a certain charge based on certain facts. Example: you have been convicted of killing Bob Jones on April 16th, 1987. Change the circumstances, and a new charge surfaces. Example: You killed Bob Jones on January 27th, 2001. The film's premise is, therefore, hard to swallow, and emerges as preposterous, not something that a mere suspension of disbelief will cure.Now, let me address the film and its problems in general. We open as Mary Sue I mean, Libby, is given a present by her husband: a fishing boat she's fallen in love with. On the romantic cruise they take, the husband is ""killed"". So far so good. Here is where Libby's Mary-Sue-ishness comes into play: she bursts out uncontrollably in tears at all the ""right"" (i.e. dramatic/emotional) bits and is cold and emotionless at all the other bits, other than one or two bits of Mary-Sue-ish, giggly laughter. Far from complex, she is a ridiculous cardboard caricature who is hard to sympathise with. After being found guilty (of course), she goes through a ridiculously fast, female version of The Shawshank Redemption (consider: two black women bet cartons of cigarettes as to how long she will last in prison. Of course, in the 2 minutes Libby is at the prison, with no transition, they become immense friends, one of the women even making a cake for her son's birthday. When she exclaims she is innocent, the women react with false cheers of support. The six years in prison, where the psychological damage to her could've been shown in a powerful way, is glanced at in passing in a few minutes. We see Libby train herself physically once she finds out that she can actually kill her husband.) She then falls into the hands of Tommy-Lee Jones as her parole officer. She makes the stupid move of trying to break into a school to find out where her son now lives. Tommy catches her, and a chase ensues, where it shows that all of Libby's training has been completely useless. Gosh. A shame, ain't it? Libby naturally escapes custody (in a neat concept for a stunt off a ferry, but one that delivers no thrills). She then goes off to pursue her son. Long and short of it is she eventually kills her husband (who tried to kill her earlier and then one more time right before his death) in self-defence. (Of course, she's painted in rather jolly colours, as she doesn't plan on killing him, giggling with glee when her gunshot misses him.) The film ends on a sickening, syrupy-sweet reunion moment between Libby and her son.The Verdict: Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, came up with his infamous ""bomb theory"", distinguishing between shock and suspense. Double Jeopardy walks around wearing the label of a thriller, but its only shocks (not thrills) come from: a) gunshots the audience knows are coming, but not exactly when OR b) Sudden, noisy appearances of ""the bad guy"" that are obviously coming, but again, the audience doesn't exactly know the precise time. Poor performances from Ashley Judd and Tommy-Lee Jones (who reprises an essentially identical role from The Fugitive, chasing after an innocent person) add to this incompetent mess of a movie.Overall Rating: 2/10",Double Jeopardy

107,RestlessRust,Sleeping with the Fugitive,6,25 February 2002,"Libby (Ashley Judd) and Nick (Bruce Greenwood) have a good life: a loving marriage, a large lake-front home, and a four-year-old son (Benjamin Weir) just for starters.  Of course in Hollywood, nothing this good can last, and for Libby her ordeal begins when she awakens on a sailboat to find her husband gone, leaving behind only a knife and a whole lot of blood.  The coast guard quickly arrives on the scene to find Libby holding the murder weapon (talk about perfect timing!) and she is soon charged with the murder.Of course Libby is convicted, thanks to woefully inadequate counsel and an unbelievably lenient judge--lenient to the prosecution, that is.  With Nick dead and Libby unwilling to put her son through the hell she went through in her parents' house, Libby's friend Angie agrees to take Matty in and adopt him.Does this sound contrived enough yet?  Wait, there's more!  Angie skips town with Matty, and Libby tracks her down through some clever detective work. While on the phone with her, Matty to call out, ""Daddy!""  Is Nick alive?Fueled by rage and realization that the fifth amendment would allow her to legally murder her husband in cold-blood, Libby connives her way through a parole hearing after six years' imprisonment  (or is it eight?) and hits the streets searching for her not-so-dead husband and more importantly her son. Assigned to a community house under the administration of one Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), she quickly violates parole and leaves Lehman up a creek (literally) as she races off on her quest.What follows is nothing more than a remake of _The Fugitive_, and we soon come to realize that _Double Jeopardy_ is essentially standard Hollywood fare with a gimmick that ultimately has very little to do with the story line.  But where _The Fugitive_ was cleverly written with compelling characters and motivations, _Jeopard_ is packed with coincidence following unbelievable coincidence until the entire movie feels too contrived to be enjoyable._Jeopardy_ also suffer from the nagging plot holes.  For example, it doesn't matter if Libby can be retried for her husband's murder; she violated parole and will never be allowed to live with her son in peace.  Also, despite Libby's lament of her childhood, she visits her mother who treats her kindly and even helps her financially.  Why was it she wouldn't let Matty live there?_Double Jeopardy_ refuses to allow us the necessary suspension of disbelief because the flaws are so obvious we can't help but notice them.  Thankfully Judd's resolve and Jones' wit, combined with a healthy dose of action and suspense, are enough to keep our interest until the unfulfilling showdown. They are not, however, enough to recommend this movie.**1/2 out of ****",Double Jeopardy
108,cinemel,Suspense thriller that misses the boat,3,16 October 1999,"`Double Jeopardy' is a movie that could have been so much better. In the year where the 100th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's birth is being celebrated, here is the germ of an idea on which he would have put his indelible stamp of creativity. The film as publicized in trailers and TV teasers persuaded many moviegoers to want to see it. However, the advertising has given away 90% of the plot. What's left is a flatly photographed and flaccidly directed yarn with so many holes in it that the audience was audibly making comments as the heroine, Libby, gamely portrayed by Ashley Judd, begins her journey of frustration, determination, and revenge.  One of Hitchcock's ongoing themes is the wrong person caught up in events beyond his/her control (North by Northwest, The Wrong Man). Here Judd's character is wrongly accused and framed for the murder of her husband (Bruce Greenwood). Once she has an idea that he is not dead at all, why didn't she just call her lawyer? This is just one of the ridiculous holes in this Swiss cheese of a plot.  When one of her prison mates, the wonderful Roma Maffia, explains that she cannot be tried again for the murder of her husband (the double jeopardy of the title), Libby patiently builds herself up physically to exact revenge on him. Tommy Lee Jones is her parole officer who doggedly pursues her, first to recapture her, and later to help vindicate her. There is lots of action, pursuit and some suspense. Jones can play this role in his sleep. He is almost the same character he ably portrayed in `The Fugitive' and `U.S. Marshals'. The pity is in what could have been. Director, Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy) has definitely seen better days.",Double Jeopardy
109,Mario64,"Good on some levels, but in the end obsurd.",5,4 August 2001,"Double Jeopardy is a film about a woman who, after falsely being convicted of her husband's murder, supposedly can kill her husband without any consequence because of double jeopardy stated in the fifth amendment to the constitution. That is absurd. Did the makers of this film attempt to contact any constitutional experts? Double Jeopard prevents the state from trying anyone again after they they have been aquited of a crime. It does not protect you if you commit the same crime against the same person twice. Even if you never have committed the first crime it does not excuse the second crime. The film fumbles over the simple idea. Ashley Judd is pretty good in this movie, as a woman who desperately wants her kid back. Tommy Lee Jones plays a less effective character, who is pretty well played but his motivation to follow the woman is lost. Everyone else in this movie is pretty ineffective, including the evil husband who apparently didn't even change his looks from his previous identity.
The first third of this movie is okay. The trial is hardly believable, with 2 major atributes, the fact that a body was never recovered and whether the blood was even her husband's on the boat, never discussed. Then in jail, which is so great her hair stays the same, she finds during a phone call that her husband is still alive. The best parts of this movie are her in jail.Six years later she's gets on parole with a parole office who's very strict played by Tommy Lee Jones. Not wanting to wait three years she goes on the search. She uses clues which at first was interesting, but the clue that finally leads her to her husband is so unbelievable, why couldn't they think of something a little more smart and realistic. All this way her parole officer follows her even though he knows nothing about her except that she may have a son. It seemed like there was a bread crumb trail everywhere she went cause he was always right behind her. How does he even know who her supposed husband is, an obvious flaw. The ending isn't an entire disappointment, but it's utterly predictable, and hardly thrilling. No surprise this movie ends with her and her son in her arms. Double Jeopardy has good elements but it hardly works as a thriller with it's utter obsurdities. It could of at least of been a little more smart and less predictable. This movie is not terrible but it is a thriller to be forgotten. I give it a 5 out of 10, not too low mostly because of Ashley Judd's performance.",Double Jeopardy

I was expecting to see more legal based stuff, but the whole focus seemed to be on Ashley Judd and whether or not she could look good while escaping from numerous people. On cue, the whole movie seems to occur too rigidly, too predictably and worst of all, it makes everyone's lives look co-incidental. The script too was pretty average, and the actors seem to function as though they need to be wound up by clockwork every morning.

This is especially true since someone may also be able to kill another in self defence, a fact which, considering the bad husband's tendency for violence and self-preservation, logically could obviate the need to rely on the double-jeopardy protection at all. Therefore, by only turning to double jeopardy rather than self-defense to make the film ""original"" the makers are making only a meaningless, superficial change. Moreover, anyone with any legal education or knowledge of US government will understand the meaning of the title from the start and realize where they are going. Finally, had they really done their research, the makers might have discovered, and utilised, the fact that in the U.S., general police powers (for handling crimes such as simple murder) are vested in the states, and that while each state must apply the double-jeopardy rule for all crimes/convictions within its boundaries, they do not all apply it where the original crime and conviction occurred in another state.

You get a fairly predictable formula film with occasional splashes of creativity and brilliance.In fairness, some of the predictability of this film is not the fault of the director, but the marketing people. Roger Ebert has criticized the production company for giving too much away in the previews, and on this point he is absolutely right. In the off chance that the reader has not yet seen the previews, I will keep the plot synopsis to a minimum. Ashley Judd plays a mother and wife who is framed for a murder. Most of the story line involves her attempts to right wrongs done to her as a result of this injustice. The specific formula is three parts The Fugitive, two parts Sleeping with the Enemy, and one part each of An Innocent Man, Deep End of the Ocean, and Shawshank Redemption.There are some innovative plot twists, but what makes the movie most worth seeing is the outstanding performance by oft underrated Ashley Judd (A Time to Kill, Norma Jean and Marilyn). She is clearly the driving force behind this film, and she rises to the occasion showing real range and an ability to get more meaning from a raised eyebrow than some actors get in an entire film. Tommy Lee Jones reprises one of his best roles by playing a near-clone of his role as U.S. Marshall Girard in The Fugitive. This character is a little more multidimensional, but it's still a character we know--and love. There are also some nice small performances from a grab bag assortment of supporting players.Besides some really good performances, the real strength of this film is solid cinematography. There are some nice innovative visuals at key points in the film and the visual elements help us stay engaged. The greatest weakness of the film is probably the plot itself.

Double Jeopardy got me with all three.   The premise of the film being if your convicted of murdering a person you cannot be convicted for murdering that same person again therefore you can legally murder someone under these unusual and unlikely circumstances.  This offers a good starting point for a good thriller unfortunately the producers failed to find a competent writer to put together a plausible screenplay around the premise. It took about five minutes into the film for me to determine that DJ was going to be a turkey. To start with Ashley Judd just happens to wake up just a few minutes before the coast guard shows up so they can see her pick up the supposed murder weapon of her husband aboard a newly bought yacht . I guess we can assume film characters playing framed murders never watch TV or movies since this cliché has only been used about  500,000 times and yet they keep picking up the murder weapon !! I'm not a lawyer so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about but isn't a body required for a murder conviction !? So now we move on to Ashley in prison and her son & girlfriend caretaker have disappeared. Ashley is a smart woman and tracks her down and wants to talk to her son and then she hears her son call for his father and now Ashley knows her husband is alive ! Does Ashley call her lawyer and have him investigate the disappearance of her son & caretaker who have now run off with her husband ? NO, She decides to serve her term and go after her husband with the knowledge giving to her by a prison mate ex lawyer about double jeopardy !  Yea I guess I would stay in jail for 6 years too since I know I could track down my husband instead of trying to get someone else to do it for you so I could get now ! If you bought that one your brain dead !! My favorite one was when she gets out of prison and breaks parole and goes home to mama. Of course the police  would never think of looking for her there !? Mama has a nice wad of money stashed for her so she can finance her way around hunting down her lost husband. Oh I forget to mention her loser parole officer Tommy Lee Jones his ex wife screwed him and took off with his child that he hadn't seen in years ! Just a coincidence of course. Tommy's not too bright leaving his car keys in the ignition with an escaped parole in the car. Tommy is only stupid enough to keep letting Ashley escape his grasp but he gets smart when trying to help track down her husband and help her in the end.  You would think at some point in the film there would be an explanation for how Ashley gets setup but it never happens and all were left with is a silly chase film. Ashley doesn't even want to kill her husband she just wants her son. Well why did she sit in jail if not to use the DJ rule to seek revenge on her betraying husband ?! She ends up shooting him in self defense "" not for revenge "" like all good guys & girls are supposed to .  I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as he seems to always be good no matter the film and Ashley Judd is a doll but she is never convincing playing a character that should be far more dark and bitter considering what she was put through.

Ashley Judd played a pretty good and for the most part believable role. Tommy Lee Jones played the same character he has played in every movie.Although this movie had great potential, the script was not written well. You know that Judd's character is convicted of murder, but not what degree of murder.  This leads to the question of how a convicted murderer gets parole in just 6 years.   There is a point where Libby (Judd's Character) learns that her husband (whom she was convicted of killing) is still alive. Rather than trying to prove he is alive and prove her innocence, Libby gets herself in shape so she can track him when she gets out.  In order to get out, she admits she killed him and throws herself on the mercy of the parole board.  I can't help wondering if these are really the actions that a woman would take in this situation (especially a woman with an affluent background).Double Jeopardy had a lot of potential.

Many of these elements are far too contrived for sustained believability and end up getting sacrificed so the idea can live on in shining glory.
One of my pet hates are scenes where the hero/heroine is the only one in the entire cinema who can't see the bleeding obvious, such as the graveyard scene. There are numerous examples of character stupidity - Libby wandering around New Orleans in full view without the least attempt to disguise herself. It's strange that Lehman, being so interested in Libby's case, doesn't know what her husband looks like until a convenient plot point. And yes, she couldn't have swum that far without somebody noticing. In these situations the film descends into genre cliches. Which is a pity because there are real moral dilemmas here to be explored, but Bruce Beresford seemed determined to make a light easy-on-the-eye piece of fluff to entertain the masses and make the studio money. He is capable of better than this. It's not a bad film, but it's not memorable. Ashley Judd looks exactly the same throughout the whole thing, not like a woman who has had to endure 6 years of prison. No wonder her son had no trouble recognizing her. If she kept calling me kiddo like that I'd disown her anyway. Tommy Lee Jones is just Sam Gerard again which is a major disappointment.
There are some fine scenes - the coffin scene really does evoke horror and a wrenching empathy from anyone who has suffered claustrophobia. But it's far too predictable and hackneyed. And the ending was a complete copout. Where are the themes of personal revenge versus parental love for Libby, duty versus personal involvement for Lehman, individual rights versus social responsibility etc? It feels at the end as though this was all a bit too hard and let's just finish it and give the audience what they (supposedly) want. You can almost see the actors shrugging. Shame Bruce. You're better than this. So is your audience.",Double Jeopardy

It turned out to be a no-brainer in the sense that if you had one, you'd not like this flick.  The opening sequence was nice and compelling and I was really starting to get into it.  After a few scenes, though, it becomes one improbable scenario after another with wasted performances by Jones and Annabeth Gish.  Mix in some questionable camera work and you get this fiasco.

That is irrelavant, just as is the victim's identity. The system would say ""yes, we made a mistake, but even so, you took it upon yourself to ACTUALLY commit a crime"". She would go to prison because this ISN'T THE SAME CRIME and she CAN be tried for it.She would be tried for the ACTUAL crime and circumstances of shooting him, just as she was tried for the crime and circumstances of murdering him on the boat with a knife.All in all this is a fairly engaging movie, but in the end it would have made more sense if she just killed him and got away with no one finding out.Tommy Lee Jones allowing her to kill him in the end because the law says it is ""double jeopardy"" is dumb, because it ISN'T the same crime, and she CAN be, and that makes him look stupid.",Double Jeopardy

166,Erich-13,"Absurd script, partially redeemed by cast",5,6 March 2000,"I knew, going into this movie, that plausibility was not at the top of the filmmakers' priority list.  The first time I saw the trailer, my reaction was ""Double jeopardy doesn't work that way!""  Still, I was unprepared for just HOW unlikely and unbelievable the plot developments were.  Most of them have already been discussed by some of the other viewers who have posted here, so I'll just do a brief enumeration of some of the ones that stuck out in my mind (and this is far from a complete list):(POTENTIAL SPOILERS)1. Most obviously, the film's ridiculous misinterpretation of the double jeopardy laws...this might have been acceptable if it was just Libby's misunderstanding of how it works, but the movie has not one but TWO ex-lawyers presenting it as correct!  (I guess that's why they're EX-lawyers...)2. The idea that an insurance company wouldn't at least look into Libby's story, especially on a $2 million policy.3. Libby has a car dealer run a credit check on another character's social security number, while impersonating that character.  The credit check turns up that person's last known address, but not that she's been dead for three years.4. Travis leaves his prisoner alone in the car with one hand free, and the keys in the ignition.5. Nobody on the ferry notices as Libby noisily bumps into several of the cars around her, not even when she knocks one of them overboard.  However, when HER car goes over, everyone comes running.6. Libby fails to notice that the youth she's following in the cemetery is not only considerably older than her son would be, but is also carrying a beer.7. After knocking Libby out, Nick doesn't bother to make sure she's dead before dumping her in a potentially-escapable coffin and leaving her. (Shades of Dr. Evil & Austin Powers!)8. After going to so much trouble with his evil plans, Nick casually (if vaguely) confesses to someone he barely knows.And those are just a few of the errors and plot holes.  However, the movie is far from a complete disaster.  Beresford's direction moves the proceedings along smoothly, no matter how far-fetched they are, and the performances of Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are highly entertaining.I wouldn't say this movie was worth the effort of renting or going to the theater, but if it comes on cable or if a friend picks up the tape (which is how I saw it), it could make for enjoyable escapist viewing.",Double Jeopardy
167,lissiemd,Better if done by Hitchcock,3,28 July 2005,"I feel this movie had the potential to be great. The actors were great, but lacking great direction. Now, if Alfred Hitchcock had stepped in as director, this film would have been as good as To Catch a Thief or Rear Window. But no, it sucks because the director sucked. He had no insight on how to make a good suspense film flow correctly. Ans how could anyone not have realized working on this film that you can't take a gun on a plane? I know this was pre 9-11, but even before that you couldn't take a gun on a plane. Was she just so cute that no one thought she would have a gun? Yeah, right!And the whole Matty story plot was sooooo fake. I did not feel the chemistry at all. I don't know whether Judd is a mom or not, but she sure didn't act like a mom towards Matty. And who the heck calls their kid Matty? It was annoying! Also, he was suppose to be 2 years old in the opening scene and he looked more 4 or 5. So it just wasn't cute to have the kid singing his ABC's when he should already know them at 5 (plus, the kid actor looked annoyed he was even in the movie to begin with). This film did a poor job depicting prison and I feel they skipped over the most essential part of the film- her six years in prison. She wouldn't be the same Elizabeth within those six years. The movie could have expanded on her prison life for more than 3 scenes. I feel like the scene where she is running in the courtyard and using the weight machines was just thrown in as an after thought. ""Oh, she's gotta get tough now so she can kill her husband."" Yeah, okay. Lame scene. Plus, we never see any guards???? Were they just at a big summer camp for criminals???The whole beginning scenes were poorly written as well,and once again, there was just NO chemistry between Judd and that Bruce guy. (he is old). Yuck, the idea gives me the shivers. A suspense film is suppose to leave the audience in ""suspense"" but the audience knew what was going to happen every step of the the way! It was lame, and so tiring to watch that I got a headache. I would only watch this fluff if you like to watch Ashley Judd. Otherwise, it's a big waste of your time.

For one, if she killed her husband, she'd STILL go to prison again, for 3 reasons: 1. No matter WHO she killed, it would still be considered a parole violation. 2. If she killed her husband, the double jeopardy clause wouldn't protect her because it would prove that she hadn't killed him before, thus making the previous conviction null and void, or she'd be tried for killing someone OTHER than her husband, if it couldn't be proved it was indeed him she'd killed. Plus, since she would have killed him on a different date, time and possibly way than the first time, it would be counted as a different crime anyway.
Basically, these thoughts kept ricocheting around my mind as I watched this movie, totally destroying any possibility of enjoying the film. If you're going to make a movie like this, get someone that can at least open a law book to consult the screenwriter.

Tommy Lee Jones is no better, as he just kind of sits around and grimaces and growls in an unfriendly way.  Bruce Greenwood, who is a very fine actor, brings a bit of professionalism to the movie, but he's limited by 1) not having much screen time, and 2) an insipid, predictable script.  For example, Ashley Judd is sent to a minimum-security prison for 4 years for murder?  What?

The film, although somewhat enjoyable was weak from start to finish.Ashley Judd, exceptional as always, and a surprising performance by Bruce Greenwood as the husband/ bad guy, saved this from being a total flop (don't you just love to hate the bad guys!).The story line moves along at lightening speed during the first 20 minutes...

Once out on the street... the character does everything possible to try and return to jail! But in the end justice prevails and she's let off scot-free (no charges for wrecking cars of assaulting parole officers).This is a film that would have benefited greatly by an additional 30 minutes. Most times, directors include too much film and lose their audience in overdrawn scenes and plot lines. But this one could have used some in-depth character development and scenes in jail to show this woman's right to be so bitter and seek revenge.I would not recommend spending the $8 at the theater on this ""race to the finish"".

Federal Law or the Courts in there, so I cannot comment on whether aspects of law arguments were right or wrong (except for the 5th amendment which is present in almost 90% of the US produced detective or court-room movies). For my non-US citizen perspective most part of the law side of the story was making sense.I liked Judd's transformation throughout the movie, from a ""sweetie-pie"" rich spouse of a rich husband with a picky attitude, to a determined woman seeking only to get her child back from an impostor criminal husband. Makes sense and hits those emotional ""relays"" we all have since our own childhood. It was a decent and honest adventure of the righteous against the malice.Jones was excellent, as always, and Greenwood was really convincing as a fraud person (even though I preferred his role as JFK on ""Thirteen days""). So much so, that sometimes in the movie you got the feeling that he really was the guilty one. Which kinda spoiled the character's impression as it developed.I got one or two dislikes though:
one is during Libby's escape on the ferry - no one is so stupid enough to do such thing in this way, and a woman who tries to claim her son back would never ever try this, no matter how desperate she was.The other is when Libby gets dumped inside a coffin and a) finds herself lying atop of a dead body and she doesn't die from Plutonic Ether perspired from the corpse b) she lights a lighter inside a coffin endorsed with fabric and filled with methane, taking her time (!!) trying to find out where the bolts are (normally if she survived (a) she would have been incinerated and suffocated to death from fire) and c) she fires two shots in closed space, with her gun almost 3-4 inches away from her face; normally, she would suffer from broken eardrum and her neck would be burnt by gun powder residues. But hey, Libby jumped out intact, only a bit disgusted and shaking with rage.

I had wanted to see this movie a few months ago when it came out, but time didn't permit.Previous writers have written in on the gaping plot holes in this movie, the recycled performance of Tommy Lee Jones, and even the absurdity of the title, considering that the ""Double Jeopardy"" clause to the 5th Amendment to the Constitution has nothing to do with wrongful convictions, only acquittals. They're all right. The premise of the film started out as ridiculous, and the plot was contrived beyond believability. I read the comments above and shrugged and said ""So what?"" In most of the movies I've seen Tommy Lee Jones in, he is essentially the same character, with just a few tweaks here and there. Take a good long look, and you'll notice that Travis Lehmen in this movie is a carbon copy of Brad Little from ""Firebirds"", Sam Gerard from ""The Fugitive"" and ""US Marshals"", Mike Roark from ""Volcano"", Agent Kay from ""Men In Black"". Jones CAN stretch his style when his scriptwriters give him something that calls for it, (see ""Under Siege"", ""Batman Forever"", ""JFK"" and ""April Morning""), but most casting people seem to want to give Jones the gruff and taciturn roles. Scriptwriters meanwhile bless him with lines that can be hilarious, inflammatory or dead serious, but will all be delivered in Jones' trademark semi-bored voice, usually without his face cracking a smile. If Jones is okay with this trend, I'm okay with it. It doesn't do much for variety, but a little familiarity is good every now and then.
As for Ashley Judd well, I thought she was enjoyable to watch while she was hyperventilating on the dock. Granted she might get sick at any minute, but she'd look good doing it. I'll refrain from commenting on her acting, since I'm obviously biased, sucker for a pretty face that I am. Whether it was good or bad, it will almost always be good to me. Bruce Greenwood played his part well, as an utterly contemptible money grubbing scoundrel. By the time the action moved to Louisiana, I was actively rooting for his violent death.
The movie has a heroine that's lovely to watch, a hero that's fun to watch, and bad guy that's easy to hate. Couple that with a few good one liners, and nice photography of the boat and of Louisiana, and I think it's an enjoyable movie.

She is one of these people, that no matter what she does, she's gonna look good.  I have never been a big fan of Ashley Judd, but she definitely raised my opinion of her in this movie.  We'd (the four of us - 3 PhD's and one non-academic) highly recommend it (I notice the theater--after being out a few weeks--is still packed, so that must say something!)

To misquote Mystery Science Theater 3000 ""I want to hurt this film, but I don't think I can hurt it as much as it has hurt me"".There is not a second of this film I cared about Ashley Judd's character, even when she was accused of her husbands murder... of course she didn't actually do it but I still would have loved to see her sent to the chair, does that make me a bad person? Anyway, when it all looks like it could be going south in her murder case she asks her BFF to look after her son. Sure her parents are still around but apparently they are such hideous creatures we don't even need to be told why the very idea of leaving him with them is unthinkable.Ashley is found guilty and goes to jail and after a few months both her friend and her son disappear. After tracking down a phone number Ashely calls her (former) gal pal and demands to talk to her son... only to have her son shout ""Daddy"" when Ashley's supposedly dead hubby wanders through the door.Ashley then turns to the worlds worst lawyer (who is also doing time... most would consider this as a big clue as to how bad this woman's legal advice would be) who tells her that, because of the legal principle of double jeopardy she is now free to kill her husband, as she has already been found guilty and served time for the crime. I cannot even begin to explain all that is wrong with that statement... just look it up for yourself.Armed with this new and INCREDIBLY incorrect knowledge Ashley get paroled and sets off to find her hubby, her slut former friend and her unattractive child. First stop of course is her parents for money.Hang on! Is this the same parents that she appeared to have cut out of her life and refused to let have custody of her son earlier? Apparently yes... and despite living what appears to be a small and slightly run down farm Ashley's mom comes through big time, handing over her life savings without so much as an I-told-you-so! According to this film people who work hard and will give you the shirt off their back are to be avoided...Anyway, Ashley tracks her husband down (on the way finding out that he may have killed her former friend in an insurance scam), takes a few photos, sends them to the authorities and clear her name. She sells her story for millions and goes on Oprah to promote her autobiographer.... just kidding.Of course what you would really do in this situation is confront your two timing, probably murderous spouse and promise to leave him alone as long as you get your kid... even though it means both you and your child will be on the run for the rest of your lives for breaching your parole.... Oh and did I mention that you agree to meet up to discuss the details of the arrangement in a graveyard? For God's sake, hubby should have gone for broke and demanded she meet him in a fireworks factory, covered in petrol and holding a lighted match!

199,goodm0urning,A complete flop of a thriller.,2,7 January 2004,"This film had me rolling my eyes within the first five minutes.  It's impossibly contrived, melodramatic, and just plain boring.Ashley Judd's character is wrongfully imprisoned for the killing of her own husband (who changes his name, moves across the country, and enjoys the comforts of a sizable fortune).  Out on parole, she discovers that, having already been tried for the murder, the 5th Amendment will allow her to execute him without legal consequence.  A reasonably intriguing premise for a film that has a lot of potential for discussing the ethical dilemma of revenge... unfortunately, that opportunity is wasted for the sake of cheap soap opera drama and stupid plot twists.  Only the most naive in the audience will be able to stomach any of it.To attempt to find a positive thing to say about this trainwreck of a film is difficult.  The best aspect you'll find is probably Ashley Judd, who does the best she can with a character of little intelligence and no development, surrounded by equally imbecilic supporting characters, in absolutely inane situations that require a superhuman suspension of disbelief to swallow. The worst part is that the film seems to think highly of its own intelligence.  If it were intended as a parody, it may have at least had some comedic substance.  Alas, all the comedy is unintentional.This may possibly be the worst film I have ever seen.",Double Jeopardy
200,Mikeylito,A lousy script mars great performances.,5,25 September 1999,"This film had the potential to be a great thriller and one reason it gets even two stars was for a marvelous Hitchcockian sequence in a New Orleans cemetery that was actually pulled off by director Bruce Beresford.  The climatic scene was near-perfect as well.  What falters is the overly contrived script by David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook, who were responsible for The Rock, where they did a much better job.  Weisberg and Cook sets up situations and then don't follow their own rules.  So, instead of a taut thriller where you wonder how our heroine is going to accomplish her goal, the whole thing comes off as lethargic.I love mysteries; I wanted to highly recommend this film, but in the end, I can't.

The acting is also fine, though it's sort of a typical 90's thriller in that it's more interested in leveraging star power than talent.Other than that, the plot is basically an exercise in ""how much can a pretty girl get away with based on her looks?""

212,levendis,The plot is in jeopardy.,3,24 May 2000,"Despite the appearance of three fine actors (Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, and Bruce Greenwood), this movie did not have enough strength to hold my attention. Moreover, the movie trailers showed practically the entire film, so I sometimes felt I was watching it for the second time.The movie centers on Judd, who is framed for her husband's murder and sent to prison. While there she learns that her husband is not dead, and when she is paroled six years later she goes on a hunt to find her son. The Movie's title comes from the often bandied about ""Double Jeopardy"" law, which states that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice. Thankfully everyone in this movies seems to have a legal degree, so the point of the movie is driven home over and over.Judd does a fine job in her role, and is convincing even though there is very little character development. Greenwood is also very good but gets very little screen time. Jones is the big mystery -- he's an accomplished actor who, I must admit, blew me away in The Fugitive, but in this film he does little more than reprise his role as Sam Gerard only with far less gusto.The many plot holes were what destroyed this movie for me. We were breezed through Libby's trial and prison stay. Matty apparently never bothered to find out more about his mother, and seemed unsurprised to be united with her again at the end of the film. Further, everyone, including the boy and the New Orleans police, seemed to be delighted by the fact that a convicted murderer was finally able to kill the wealthy, respectable socialite.Overall, this movie is better than watching paint peel.

The suspense level is really low and it didn't really do much to keep me at the edge of my seat except for the near end of the film. The plot is probably where this movie destroyed it for me. It had an interesting concept, but the execution was very poor and it lacked suspense, thrills and energy. Tommy Lee Jones is easily the strongest actor in the film and that's one of the things that prevented me from rating this movie any lower than what I gave it. It has some good parts that don't make the film entirely bad, but it's just an all-around dull thriller that has been poorly executed.I'd say rent it first before you buy it just to be on the safe side.

I didn't find a single surprise in the movie and overall found it to be almost boring.I thought Ashley Judd and pretty good as was Bruce Greenwood. Tommy Lee Jones was OK, although his character was weak and never really developed.As for the story, it's a good idea, but the execution leaves something lacking. There were no surprises in the story (something very important in a ""thriller""). Without the twists and turns expected in a good thriller, the story seems to just meander to the inevitable ending. I (as did the group of people I was with) knew the ending about 15 minutes into the movie. There was no suspense of ""who did it"" or ""will he get away with it"".All that can really be said about ""Double Jeopardy"" is that it had potential--great cast and good story idea. However, it just never came together. Part of this might be attributed to the marketing of the movie. As an example, ""The Sixth Sense"", released just a few weeks prior, managed to keep the ending a (sort of) secret, until it was seen. With ""Double Jeopardy"" though, the viewer goes into the theater knowing who did it and able to guess the ending without much thought.",Double Jeopardy
235,Jeru-9,Why?,5,19 February 2000,"Well,It's hard for me to say that I truly enjoyed this movie.
It's a weak rehash of the whole ""Fugitive"" storyline, sadly enough with Tommy Lee Jones re-taking the fugitive-finder role.  Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Parsons, a woman falsely convicted for the murder of her husband. While in jail for this crime she finds out, fairly unrealistically, that, oh my god, HER HUSBAND ISN'T REALLY DEAD!  After the filmmakers shoddily push her through six years of jail, she goes about trying to find her husband and her child.  Sounds pretty, you know, average.  It is.The story never really finds anything to focus on. We don't get a really good chase down the fugitive story, because we don't ever really get to care about Tommy Lee Jones character.  A side point, the best part of the movie for me was the way that Jones played the character.  He was gruff and amusing and was the only character that I was really excited about. The directors never seemed to be able to find one place that they really wanted to go with the movie.  They bring up the whole double jeopardy thing...but, it's only brought up...and then sort of discussed at the end of the flick again.  Also how can you make an interesting fugitive movie, if the fugitive is only running from her...parole officer?Ashley Judd is a beautiful actress, that's no doubt.  But she seemed to struggle with making the character anything but generic.  It was fun to look at her, but she's no one I'm going to remember in a week.
Overall, the story was slow and had problems going anywhere.  Tommy Lee Jones helps to save the movie, and so does the cinematography in the movie, wide, expansive; a different take on filming a boring genre.

Her husband is nowhere to be found and in short order she is convicted of murdering him and pushing him overboard.  We know she is innocent, but this is not a courtroom story. After the conviction she has her best friend take care of her son and they soon vanish.  She spends the entire film looking for her son.The point here is that we get to watch a woman struggle against the odds, by herself, to solve a relationship crisis.  If you're a junkie for that kind of thing, bring your bowl of ice cream to the theater and enjoy yourself.The rest of us will be scratching our heads, wondering why there are so many holes the story.

She learns of solid evidence that could get her out of prison in a hurry, but never calls anyone for help.What gives?  Doesn't this successful woman have family that can help, friends from school, anyone at all?  She just needs one person to hire a private investigator for a day and poof, she'd be out of prison in a flash.But noooo.  We have to watch her struggle (against the odds, by herself).

Not very good.  Sometimes I don't know why we even have ratings.The double jeopordy clause would not apply because the crime would have been committed at two seperate times.  For instance, if I go out and rob the same bank twice I can be tried and sentenced twice.  If I rob it once and am found innocent or guilty but rob it a second time I can be tried for that as well.

This makes sense to me. When in prison, Libby is informed by one of her 'ex lawyer' convict sisters that as she has already killed her husband, and been convicted, she can do whatever she likes to him and not be convicted. She takes this on face value, and sets off on a variety of montage scenes to show her gaining fitness so she can accomplish this very task. Up to this point the movie seems like its setting up for an interesting story line.This is were it all starts to fall apart. Libby is released on parole after serving 6 years in prison. 6 years for a murder sentence? Sometimes you just have to accept these things in films so i will. Following this she makes what is possibly the longest list of stupid decisions I've ever seen a character make, including breaching your parole to steal a document from a school, making it extremely obvious which document you stole to directly identify you, getting on what is the most ridiculous chase scene from the police I've ever witnessed, including a beach buggy flip scene for chasing a suspect on foot, driving a car which you are handcuffed into in the river, and selecting a cemetery as the scene for which you meet your husband who is out to kill you. After these ridiculous amount of breaches in all logic from the main character who is suspected to be the one 'in control', she than continues to flirt with her ex husband, demanding her child back. Wasn't the whole point of getting out to commit your revenge? As a final touch to an already ridiculous series of events, they are going to fake her death and indict him with it at the end as some form of threat? By this point in the movie i was just watching one ridiculous scene after another take place with no obvious common sense from any of the main characters. This movie on face value really does seem like one of those classic 80's mystery thrillers, and i must admit, despite the ridiculous plot i was entertained, and its worth seeing, once.

This is a terrible script with a boring performance by the lead actor. Ashley Judd lumbers through this film unable to give a believable emotion. Tommy Lee Jones plays the same character he did in, the much superior, ""The Fugitive"". However, his talents are wasted on the stupid script. There are a lot of examples where the plot and events make no sense. Other reviews have pointed out Ashley's character picking up the bloody knife. She did that moments before a Coast Guard boat pulls up in the fog ready to arrest her. Who called them and why were her husband's movements to stage his disappearance never explained? How is it possible for Tommy Lee Jones to never check on her husband's identity and picture until near the end of the movie? Why isn't Bruce Greenwood arrested for faking his own death as soon as TLJ meets him? Why does Ashley Judd get paroled after only 6 years? Why doesn't Greenwood recognize his wife's voice when she bids on him at the Bachelor auction? How is Greenwood able to become a successful hotel owner and never be recognized as the missing Nick Parson's? Why didn't Greenwood kill her before putting Ashley in the coffin? Why was TLJ in such a rush to get back to the car when he saw Ashley trying to unlock her handcuffs? They were on a Ferry, where was she going to go? Who in their right mind drives a car into a bay when they cannot free themself from being locked to a door handle? Matty was first told his father was dead, then his mother, then she shows up alive and there is a happy ending but she still has to tell him his father is dead and this time she really did kill him. What are the chances that Matty is one of the small group of boys playing soccer when Ashley drives up to the school and how does she know that? When TLJ is running after Ashley (who is driving away in a truck) the whole thing is laughable, he almost catches her and the old art dealer is right behind him. How is the gun that Ashley took from TLJ still working after it was submerged in the bay?

246,wcgreen-65865,Good concept squandered,2,5 March 2017,"Switch off your disbelief before watching Double Jeopardy and you might enjoy this movie. Otherwise, it will drive you crazy with all the ridiculous plot flaws. For starters, the premise is flat out wrong. The first amendment does protect people from being convicted twice for the same crime. The same crime means just that.... same place, time, circumstances and victim. It is not a blank check for someone falsely convicted of a crime to go on a crime spree to avenge their wrongful conviction. In essence, this movie is just one improbable... if not impossible... scenario after another. Very little that takes place in this movie could or would ever happen in real life so the viewer must be assumed to be a complete imbecile to swallow it all without question.It wastes little time getting to the first impossible to believe situation. Woman's husband buys her an obscenely expensive yacht out of the blue to show his utter devotion to her. They spend a romantic evening on it yet she wakes up the next morning alone and covered with blood. She walks around as if in a daze and discovers a bloody knife which of course she picks up at the precise moment that the coast guard pulls up along side the boat. This was a scene in almost every episode of the Perry Mason TV series, and each time I would say ""Do NOT pick up the murder weapon!"" but they ALWAYS did.The rest of the movie is just more of the same. For example, when she finds out her husband is actually alive, why didn't she simply dial up her lawyer and tell him? Lawyers love to find out that their clients were falsely convicted. It would have taken him all of a day or two to retain a private detective to track down hubby and prove he was indeed very much alive then Voila! .... she walks free, hubby goes to prison along with her best friend/accomplice to her false conviction and she gets her son back.

She knows how to act, she even made me cry several times in the movie. Her revenge is so strong, and she has a determination i've never seen before; which i personally like very much.

273,marhefka,I Keep Watching It Over and Over,10,4 August 2013,"Let me be up-front. I loved it. Easily in my top 20 all time and maybe top 10. I think it's a ""Mind Thriller."" The ingenious way she gets Angie's phone no. The scene at the BMW dealer where she gets Angie's new address. Later, she obtains Nick's new and latest name and his address through a Kandinsky painting. She recognized the painting from a newspaper article about Angie's ""accident."" It had been hanging in her house. She knew that all Kandinsky paintings were registered and used this to find Nick' New Orleans address.I'm aware of the ""relatively"" low rating of this film. I've read most of the reviews and many of them are not so complimentary. Many of these people have rated the movie as a ""0"" or a ""1."" This is one reason why the rating is so low. I will now address some of the most common complaints about the movie:1. Double Jeopardy doesn't exist. The main plot point of the movie is that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice in America. Many - apparently knowledgeable - people have said that this is not true as a point of law. I'm not a lawyer but I would like to ask a question: Has it ever been proved in a court of law? Has anyone ever murdered someone, paid their penalty, got out of jail, found the still alive person, and the killed them? I doubt that this has ever happened. If it does, I venture to say they would find the second murder justifiable.I have always assumed that Double Jeopardy does in fact exist. Even it it really doesn't, then what is the problem? In U.S. culture, it does exist. It is used as plot points in many movies. Why did Charles (Terry Thomas) give a gun to Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) in How to Murder Your Wife.2. No credibility. There are many action scenes in the movie. Each one is believable. Taken together, I guess one's credibility must be stretched. But, what is the problem? This is a movie that exists for our entertainment. Is it really so important that - although she was initially handcuffed - she swims to the surface in the bay, hits Tommy Lee Jones over the head with his own gun, and then swims to shore, is hard to believe. I enjoyed the scene. While watching it, I was not thinking that it's not credible. Was Barry Kane (Robert Cummings in Saboteur) more credible when he, while two hands were hand-cuffed together, jumped off a very tall bridge, and somehow swam to shore while police officers were in pursuit?3. Cops out of Double Jeopardy. The complaint was that although she initially wanted to kill Nick, she eventually only wanted her son back and thus reneged on the Double Jeopardy plot point. My response is that she changed her mind after she realized that ""Simon Rider"" had killed his wife. She now knew that he was more dangerous that she thought. She reverted to the no. 1 priority which was to get her son back. This is not spelled out in the movie and so it's a little like Hitchcock, isn't it? He loved to make the viewers think for themselves.Speaking, of Hitchcock, I have wondered, what if this movie was exactly the same except he was the Director. Then what would the IMDb rating be? I maintain it would be close to 8.0.4. Too Predictable. Yes, I admit it was predictable. I knew the moment she went to prison that she would get out and eventually be reunited with her son. So what? The ending was one of the most satisfying I've ever seen. I watched ""High Noon"" for only five minutes and knew that the Marshal (Gary Cooper) would have a gun-fight at the end of the movie and that he would win. Didn't stop Gary from winning an Oscar at all.5. Lacks Suspense. Suspense is not a concrete thing. I can only answer this complaint by saying that, for me, it was very suspenseful. When she found Angie Rider's new address in Colorado and, before going to the door, preparing the gun - was this not suspenseful? Many situations in the movie were suspenseful. 6. The Annoying Hesitation Before Shooting. When Libby (Ashley Judd) and Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) confronted Jonathan near the end, I agree that it was annoying that Jonathan hesitated before shooting. This allowed Travis to jump on him and eventually, allowed Libby to kill him. I didn't like it either but it didn't bother me. This seems to be the Hollywood way. In summary, Double Jeopardy is great entertainment. It's clever, suspenseful, and has a tear-jerking ending.",Double Jeopardy
274,despeyland,What did they tell Matty?,10,14 February 2005,"I have only one remark about this movie, and that is a HUGE plot hole. Matty obviously knows that his mother (Libby) is in prison, and he is seen visiting her. And he obviously is not told that the reason that she is in prison is that she murdered his father (Nick), because Matty knows that his father is still alive, and he is seen with Nick. The audience is never told what reason that Nick has given to his son that Libby was sent to prison! It is revealed to the audience at the end of the movie that Matty was told that Libby is dead, but never why she was sent to prison! Also, Matty is with Libby when she is arrested for suspicion of murdering Nick. He is a very bright boy, and had to have known what was going on!",Double Jeopardy

She visits her mother - do you think cops might be monitoring mom for this visit? One good scene: chasing the boy in the cemetery, which I think was cut brutally to fit CBS's requirements. But the main thought is: Louisiana is the only Napoleanic justice state in U.S., do their laws about double jeopardy apply uniformly with other states?

Tommy Lee Jones is right at home as he pursues his latest fugitive; and Ashley Judd once again plays the strong, independent female.  Two of my favorite actors doing what they do best.While I am more that willing to allow for some dramatic license, I was really distracted at times by events in the movie that were too far removed from the way things happen and the way people act in the real world.  The prosecutor in the courtroom scene would have at least been warned by the judge for some of her outrageous remarks and behavior.  I was also troubled by the fact that Ashley Judd's character while seeking help locating her son from prison, never tried to contact her lawyer. They seemed to have a good relationship.  What happened to this guy? Did he die, fall off the edge of the earth or what?  Finally, I don't see how even the smallest car can fall off the back of a ferry boat full of passengers and not be noticed by at least one person.

The couple are celebrating on a boat and, by the end of the night, one of them will be presumed dead.Reminiscent of a John Grisham tome, the entire plot in this carefully wrought screenplay turns on a point of constitutional law: a person can't be tried for the same crime twice, and it's this that fuels the story from start to finish.Most of the screen time goes to Judd and Tommy Lee Jones (Travis), and that's a good thing. They deliver an easy to watch, likeable performance wrapped in an enjoyable chemistry that carries the film through its twists and turns until it delivers and satisfies with the sweet taste of revenge the film promises throughout.The director and editor deftly move the story along with filmmaking that doesn't distract from the delight of a tightly constructed story.I would encourage potential viewers to ignore the yaps from others and see the film for themselves and decide. You won't be sorry.Spoiler Section -- Kept to Absolute MinimumAs for its detractors, this film was released in 1999 long before the digital footprints and online identities of today.
