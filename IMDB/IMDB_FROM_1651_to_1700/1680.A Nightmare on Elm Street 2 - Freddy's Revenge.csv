0,TheLittleSongbird,This revenge is more damp than it is terrifying,5,29 December 2017,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still to me one of the scariest and best horror films there is, as well as a truly great film in its own right and introduced us to one of the genre's most iconic villains in Freddy Krueger. It is always difficult to do a sequel that lives up to a film as good as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' let alone one to be on the same level.'A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge' is not to me the dreadful film as reputed, but, while its attempts to do something different is admirable, it should have been much better than it turned out to be. It is very difficult to not feel disappointed when you inevitably compare 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' to its first sequel and find that the drop in quality is so significant and hard to ignore. Whether 'Freddy's Revenge' is the worst of the series is debatable, to me and many others it is one of the weaker ones. 'Freddy's Revenge' is not a complete waste of time. It starts off very promisingly, with the bus scene is thrillingly unsettling. Easily the film's scariest moment and the scene one remembers the most. Robert Englund is still very freaky and shows why Freddy is so iconic as a villain, he may not be quite as terrifying but the material isn't as strong here and he is still highly effective. It's not a bad-looking film, there is a slickness to it and there are some nightmarish effects. There are some eerie moments, though none of the rest of the film lives up to the bus scene, and some amusing dark humour. The music is suitably haunting.However, there are also a fair share of problems. The scares don't come enough, and while there are effective ones there are also just as many that are perfunctory and pretty tame by 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' series standards. Credit is due for trying to do something different and there are parts that do intrigue. A tighter pace and less pedestrian direction would have made the execution better, as well as trying to do less and focus more on the quality of the scares and how the story is told.Jesse is such a dull damp squib of a character who lacks a quick-thinking or logical brain let alone any kind of presence. The one-note expressionless acting of Mark Patton accentuates this. The rest of the cast are nowhere near as bad, but when it comes to the acting the only one to properly rise above the material is Englund. Lastly, the ending is a slap in the face and really undoes Freddy's character, he would never do what he does at the end and it doesn't make sense for him to do it.Overall, not that bad but could have been much better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
1,Leofwine_draca,Novelty horror sequel with plenty of gore and nastiness,5,5 September 2016,"This quickly-made sequel to Wes Craven's hit horror film seems to be pretty much despised by fans of the series, although I am forced to disagree. Although the scripting and acting is below par, the movie is at least fast paced and never lets up during scenes of gory incident. Special effects from the reliable Kevin Yagher and some imaginatively disturbing fantasy sequences combine to make this an average but fun attempt at a mid '80s horror film, as dated as they come and with a strange, wild homosexual subtext running throughout. Witness the brutal death of the sadistic gay sports teacher who has his buttocks slapped before getting shredded under the steel fingers of Krueger, or Jesse's continuous girly screaming, for evidence of this. An interesting and unusual angle to an otherwise straight-forward horror flick.A lot of flak seems to be aimed at this film due to its decision to have Freddy killing people in real life and not just in their dreams. Watch carefully and you'll notice that this apparent error is actually explained at the beginning - Freddy uses Jesse's possessed body as a gateway to the real world and can therefore go on and do all he likes to conscious folk. Direction from Jack Sholder (THE HIDDEN) is quite capable and makes good use of dark, atmospheric sets. Sadly, the acting is fairly bad, but no more so than your typical teen slasher from the '80s, aside from Robert Englund who once again does a good job as the dream demon and still manages to be scary at times. Clu Gulager and Hope Lange turn up playing Jesse's parents for name value more than anything else, considering that their roles are fairly lightweight.The very basic plot is more of an excuse for a string of bizarre fantasies to be acted out and these act as the highlights of the movie. Things open with a literal bus ride into hell which is very spectacularly done, ending on a real cliff-hanger. From then on we get treated to such gory delights as a dozen bloody slashings, ants crawling in festering wounds, Freddy tearing open his skull to expose his brain, and in the sickening but fantastic highlight, a fully-grown Freddy emerging painfully from Jesse's body via his own stomach! The best bit of the film is undoubtedly a slaughter which takes place at a pool party and the final love-conquers-all confrontation is a bit of a let down by comparison. Watching swimmers burn, barbecues explode, and moronic teenagers slashed up is great fun, however. Hardly a classic movie, instead this is a one-watch novelty piece which will appeal to undemanding genre fans.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
2,SnoopyStyle,Rush to cash in,5,9 August 2013,"Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) is the new teen moving into the Elm street home. He is soon haunted by Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) in his dream. This sequel was definitely a rush job for NewLine Studios to cash in. Only Robert Englund returns. No Wes Craven. None of the surviving kids. In fact, Freddy Krueger gains a new power by possessing somebody and climbing into the real world. It seems an unwise move as it would allow Freddy to be killed more easily. It is also noteworthy that none of the kids were stars and none of them has since broken out as big stars. That should indicate the caliber of acting skills involved. It's quite disappointing since normally we'd expect an improvement after a surprise hit. That's the best way to describe this movie: a disappointment. There is also a latent homosexual conflict in the character. It would have been an interesting idea but it's executed horribly here.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
3,claudio_carvalho,Possessed by Freddy Krueger,7,29 March 2009,"When the Walsh's move to the Elm Street, the teenager Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) has a creepy nightmare with a burned man wearing a glove with blades called Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) that tells him that Jesse has the body and he has the brain. Jesse becomes close to Lisa Webber (Kim Myers), who also has a crush on him, and befriends his school mate Ron Grady (Robert Rusler), who tells him that his house had remained closed for five years since the former dweller Nancy Thompson that went to a mental institution after witnessing the death of her boyfriend on the other side of the street and her mother in the living room. Lisa finds the diary of Nancy hidden in a locker while Jesse is possessed by Freddy Krueger that uses him to kill his victims.This sequel to the classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is underrated in IMDb. The story about possession is more romantic with the love of Lisa for Jesse, has plot holes but is also entertaining, with the use of great special effects. This movie is also the debut of Kim Myers, who has an impressive resemblance with Meryl Streep, in the cinema in a lead role. Again there is an open conclusion to give a sequel to the saga of Freddy Krueger. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Pesadelo 2  A Vingança de Freddy "" (""The Hour of the Nightmare 2  The Revenge of Freddy"")",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
4,gavin6942,A Weak Part in the Early Entries to the Franchise,6,15 October 2013,"A teenage boy (Mark Patton) is haunted in his dreams by Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) who is out to possess him to continue his murdering in the real world.Although this film is generally good, it does not hold up to be as strong as part one or part three. Which is unfortunate, because the principals involved (Mark Patton and Robert Rusler) are two of the nicest, funniest people I have ever met. Great people do not always equal a great movie, though.The strong point is the gore, which was not only cutting edge for the time, but still holds up as pretty intense today. The lack of Freddy through most of the film seems to be what makes it a bit less than the first or third, though some scenes here do not require him at all to be good. The rapport between Rusler and Patton is strong.Interestingly, this has become known as the ""gay"" Freddy film, and some have called it the gayest horror film of all. Indeed, it is said that writer David Chaskin intentionally added homoerotic phrases and actions to the script (including the cue for Robert Rusler to wiggle his butt at bat). This is further explained in the documentary ""Never Sleep Again"". This was Chaskin's first film, and he went on to make a few more horror flicks, including Tibor Takács' ""I, Madman"".",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
5,lee_eisenberg,"Remember what they said in ""Scream""?",5,28 December 2005,"In ""Scream"" they said that the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was neat but the sequels sucked. Of course, it's practically a given that sequels will suck. Still, Robert Englund in his most famous role is always good for a laugh. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge"" features pretty much the same things as the original, except that it's now getting played more for laughs. I can't help but wonder why they made so many sequels, right up to ""Freddy vs. Jason"". Oh well, they're all cool for what they are, but the first one was definitely the best. Robert Englund may be the coolest horror actor alive today, and Wes Craven may be the coolest horror director alive today.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
6,jboothmillard,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,2,20 May 2013,"I had previously watched all films in the Halloween and Hellraiser franchises, and I knew at some point I would want to watch all films in the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, i.e. with iconic villain Freddy Krueger, so this was the first sequel, from director Jack Sholder (Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies). Basically it has been five years since the events on Elm Street, and seventeen year old teenager Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) and his family have moved to the neighbourhood and into the house formally occupying Nancy Thompson. Soon after moving in Jesse starts having nightmares, appliances and objects in the house are going berserk and gaining a mentality of their own, and pets are attacking that before would never have. The young man turns to his new girlfriend Lisa Webber (Kim Myers) to help him, and together they find out the terrible events that happened before, including of course the murders of child killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), burned alive but coming back to life in dreams with razor hands. It gets worse for Jesse when not only are his nightmares becoming more intense and terrifying, but he feels Freddy manifesting within him, he in one dream witnesses the brutal killing of gym teacher Coach Schneider (Total Recall's Marshall Bell), and this is in fact reality. He cuts himself off from his family knowing the danger he could put them in if Freddy comes, this even happens while Lisa, and trying to get friend Ron Grady (Robert Rusler) to watch him sleep doesn't help either as he ends up victim too. Finally one night during a bad dream Freddy is strong enough to take full control of Jesse and get his revenge, Jesse and Lisa are also children of the parents who burned him to death, the psycho even causes rampage at a pool party killing many random young people. Lisa leads Freddy inside of her boyfriend to the old power plant Krueger worked in, and she manages to set his body on fire, which slowly brings Jesse back from his possessed state, but of course the next day when it looks over a bad dream of a bus crashing becomes reality when Freddy reappears. Alsop starring Clu Gulager as Ken Walsh, Hope Lange as Cheryl Walsh, Melinda O. Fee as Mrs. Webber and Tom McFadden as Mr. Webber. I can't really say that much good about Englund in this film, even though he does his best to remain cheeky and vulgar like the original and great film, the dream based sequences are ridiculous, not in an inventive way, the blood spill lacks style, and there is nothing in the story or attempted scary bits to grip you, it is a highly disappointing and terrible horror sequel. Pretty poor!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
7,ccthemovieman-1,"The Worst of the ""Freddy"" Movies",3,25 June 2006,"This was my lowest-rated of the Nightmare On Elm Street movies, of which I believe there were seven in all. If you've watched all of them you get an appreciation of Freddy's sense of humor. However there is none of that in this film. No humor, no people to like and only one good (entertaining) horror scene. That scene is the opening one in which a bus winds up atop a giant rock formation. But after that, none of the famous dream scenes are memorable. They don't have the imagination, humor and horror the others did in the other films.Meanwhile, the ""kids"" in here are the same: profane, sex-crazed high school kids....hardly the girl next door. One of them, Kim Myers, looks a lot like a young Meryl Streep.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
8,Tweekums,Five years later and Freddy is back,7,22 June 2017,"Five years have passed since the events of the first film and the Walsh family have just moved into the house where the events of the first film were centred. Their teenage son Jesse starts having nightmares that feature the razor-fingered fiend Freddy Krueger. He isn't attacked in this dreams; instead Freddy is trying to possess him so that he can carry on his murderous spree in the real world. As he starts to behave strangely his parents wonder if he is on drugs or needs psychiatric help. Inevitable people start to die; starting with the gym teacher who had picked on Jesse and his friend Grady. There are other strange occurrences; the Walsh's pet birds act strangely and attack them and the temperature rises unnaturally. Jesse's girlfriend Lisa tries to help him but she could just be putting herself in danger. Things get bloody when a large group of teens, including Jesse and Lisa, gather at a party and Freddy emerges.I wasn't expecting too much from this film; Wes Craven is no longer directing and apart from Freddy Krueger we have an entirely new set of characters thankfully it turns out that it wasn't bad at all. The fact that Freddy is trying to possess Jesse rather than just murdering teens in their dreams meant it wasn't just a rehash of the first film. The cast of relatively unknown actors does a decent enough job; most notable Mark Patton who is pretty good as Jesse and Kim Myers as Lisa. It takes a while before anybody is killed but that didn't matter too much as the tension was built nicely. Once the killing does start it isn't immediately obvious how it is happening as this victim seems to be being attacked by an invisible force. The special effects are pretty good. Overall I'd say this was a decent sequel; not as good as the first but still rather fun.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
9,BA_Harrison,A disappointing sequel to Craven's original.,3,4 January 2007,"After a promising opening sequence, director Jack Sholder completely fumbles the ball and ultimately delivers a shoddy, incomprehensible mess that besmirches the good name of Wes Craven's original masterpiece. David Chaskin's poorly devised script completely ignores the rules laid down by Craven in A Nightmare On Elm Street, allowing Freddy to possess the body of teen Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) in order to wreak havoc in the real world.With numerous unintentionally funny scenes (check out the exploding parakeet, the 'tidying the room' scene, and the attack on Coach Schneider by sporting equipment!) and plenty of homo-erotic moments (male bonding, S&M leather bars and the coach being whipped on his bare butt with a towel), I really don't think this is what fans expected from a sequel.Although the film may be enjoyed if one views it as camp trash, it is easy to see why this film is one of the most universally reviled horror sequels of all time; with its tedious pacing, lack of decent gore or scares, and a total cop-out ending that sees Krueger defeated by 'love', Freddy's Revenge is very disappointing.Fortunately, the franchise improved big time with the release of part 3, Dream Warriors, but part 2 will always be there to remind makers how not to make a Freddy Krueger movie.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
10,Quinoa1984,Not too good,6,12 July 2000,"You know, if you compare this film to the original, you will see an incredible drop off.  First off, the plot isn't good, the director is not Craven (he wouldn't return as director until part 7) and Freddy isn't as real as in part 1 (if being in dreams is real).  I couldn't even follow the plot, which says something and the main character is stupid.  If I were anyone else out there reading this review, please stay away from this movie- unless you are a rabid fan of Nightmare on Elm Street. C-",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
11,BandSAboutMovies,Unfairly criticized,7,29 October 2018,"With Craven stepping aside, Jack Sholder (Alone in the Dark, which was the first New Line movie before the original Elm Street and The Hidden) was selected as the director and David Chaskin was selected to write this (it was his first Hollywood script and he'd go on to write I, Madman and The Curse).Chaskin's theme for the film - which until the documentary Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy he would always say was just subtext - is the main character Jesse (Mark Patton) coming to grips with his homosexuality. Patton struggled with his anger over this film for years, as he felt betrayed as the filmmakers knew that he was in the closet. Between this role and playing a gay teenager in Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, he feared being typecast at best and labeled at worst. Yes, in 1985, this was the world that we lived in.Chaskin claimed in interviews that Patton just played the role too gay, but Patton bristled at that claim. The emotional stress led Patton to quit acting for some time to pursue a career in interior design. That said, Chaskin claims that he has tried to reach out and apologize to the actor over the years.Director Sholder has said that he didn't have the self-awareness to think that the film had a gay subtext, but an unfilmed scene almost had Krueger slide a knife into Jesse's mouth. Makeup artist Kevin Yagher talked Patton out of filming that scene for the sake of his career.Years later, Patton would write Jesse's Lost Journal, a series of diary entries that would set his feelings - and his character's - straight, pardon the horrible pun.The sequel starts with a dream sequence where Jesse Walsh (Patton) dreams of being stuck inside a school bus with Freddy at the wheel. Jesse's circle of friends include Lisa, who he's friends with but too shy to ask out, and Grady (Robert Rusler, Sometimes They Come Back), a frenemy that seems more like a crush.Jesse has moved into Nancy Thompson's home, which was on the market for five years after she was institutionalized and her mother killed herself. His family has Clu Gulager from Return of the Living Dead as his dad, Hope Lange from Death Wish as his mother and a little sister that he bothers when she's trying to sleep.Lisa and Jesse discover Nancy's diary, which explains how ridiculous the house is to live in. It's always 97 degrees, birds attack you at will before they spontaneously combust and your parents accuse you of setting it all up.Meanwhile, Jesse is dealing with all sorts of strangeness, like a sadistic gym teacher who really likes to go to punk clubs and get whipped. One night, a dream takes him to that bar and the gym teacher makes him run laps in the middle of the night. That gym teacher is played by Marshall Bell, who was George in Total Recall, the host for Kuato. Freddy possesses our hero and the coach gets clawed up in the shower. The cops find Jesse wandering the highway naked, which doesn't seem all that weird to his mother.Lisa and Jesse go to Freddy's lair in an abandoned factory, then she has a pool party. Yes, I just wrote that sentence. At the party, they kiss and have perhaps the most awkward make out session ever, until Freddy causes changes in Jesse's body that make him run to Grady for help. Yes, he gets so upset about making up with a girl that he runs to his male crush, only to transform into Freddy in an astounding practical effects sequences and kill Grady. He returns to the pool party and lays absolute waste to the partygoers as Freddy before getting chased off by multiple shotgun blasts.Only Lisa's love - and kisses - can bring Jesse out of Freddy. But it's all for nothing, as the nightmare from the beginning becomes real and their schoolbus turns into a deathtrap. Even though their friend Kerry (who has the best outfits in the movie) tries to calm them down, Freddy's claw emerges from her chest.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
12,Coventry,Spontaneous combustion-parakeets!!,4,12 September 2005,"You can't deny that Wes Craven's original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" was horror of great significance and, although dreadfully overrated, it was a pretty clever and spooky film that introduced the legendary icon of Freddy Krueger. It was obvious right from the start that none of the several sequels would ever live up to the original and this first attempt immediately confirms so. Despite a dazzling intro, showing a school bus racing through a nightmarish wasteland with Freddy at the wheel, this is a very tame and soft teenage-horror flick, completely lacking coherence and logic. The story supposedly takes place 5 years after the initial Elm Street events and the house where Nancy lived has been sold to the Walsh family. The adolescent son Jesse begins to suffer from nightmares in which Freddy Krueger orders him to kill in his shape. The screenplay is a series of stupidities and continuity errors but the whole things basically is an excuse to show fairly impressive visual effects, so who cares about the story anyways? Jesse's transformations into Freddy Krueger are well staged and the murders he commits are decently gore. Several sequences and scenery don't make the slightest bit of sense (exploding parakeets, guard dogs with children's faces) and the suspense-elements of the original have vanished entirely. The acting is considerably good, even though the hero screams like a little girl and the heroine looks like Meryl Streep's younger sister. At least in this first sequel, Robert Englund doesn't constantly fire off unfunny and embarrassing one-liners.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

15,hitchcockthelegend,Possession is nine-tenths of the law.,5,10 October 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the runt of the Elm Street litter. It was unfortunate to be the sequel to a landmark horror film, a film that birthed one of the ultimate horror icons whilst having at its core a terrifying premise. A premise that was superbly executed by all involved in the first film. Part 2 bravely tried to advance the bogeyman story to another level, to one of possession, which in hindsight was a mistake.There's also the mixed tonal flow and confused intents that hamper the pic. Whilst the young members of the cast are too blank to garner the required amount of sympathy to get us to care about their plight, especially lead lad Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh. However, there is still a lot to like here, some striking imagery grabs the attention and it is not without some unnerving scares.The debates about what metaphors the makers were going for still exist, and that homo-erotic sheen is never going to go away, but even though it's an average Elm Street movie, it's not as dreadful as it was first painted. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
16,Hey_Sweden,"""You are all my children now!""",7,23 November 2011,"Set five years after the events of the original ""Nightmare"", it sees a young man, Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) move with his family into Nancy Thompson's old house, and good old Freddy (Robert Englund) tries a different tack in this story: possessing Jesse's body to enable him to kill all the teenagers outside of the dream world, thereby ignoring the rule Wes Craven had put in place that Freddy could *only* exist in dreams. Of course, nowadays, it's pretty much impossible to watch ""Freddy's Revenge"" and not pick up on all of the homosexual overtones, and even see the movie as a metaphor for a young man's homosexual panic. Where does Jesse run to in a time of need? The bedroom of classmate Ron Grady (Robert Rusler). Where does one of the nightmare sequences take place? In a shower room where a butt naked Coach Schneider (character actor Marshall Bell, in his first substantial film role) is whipped on his rear with towels before finally being gored by the infamous glove. Even Jesse himself is a decidedly un-macho lead, and much more victim than hero. There's still a strong female character, in the form of Jesse's girlfriend Lisa Webber (Kim Myers), who saves the day through means that some fans can see as much too corny. On the plus side, for a movie that was basically rushed into production, it still works quite well at times. For one thing, Freddy at this point remains a creepy and twisted character without his dialogue being overly inundated with wisecracks. The moment where Freddy tries to manipulate Jesse into killing his sister is a good and eerie moment. There are surreal touches - somehow, Freddy seems to be able to affect changes in the real world this time around to which various people are witness. The exploding bird bit is a hoot, as are the guard dogs near the end that wear children's face masks. And there is a fun sense of humour, especially when a misguided schmuck attempts to ""help"" Freddy with him snarling ""Help yourself!"" in reply. Kevin Yagher takes over the makeup and gore effects gig and does a good job. Christopher Young's music is much unlike Charles Bernstein's score from the first movie, but in a definite good way, as it's simply spooky. It goes without saying that Englund is as fun as ever; leading lady Myers is quite appealing, and supporting players Clu Gulager and Hope Lange are effective as the cranky dad and the concerned mom. In closing, using the Bing Crosby rendition of ""Did You Ever Hear a Dream Walking?"" adds one of the most interesting touches; with it not exactly being a typical choice for this sort of thing. ""Freddy's Revenge"" may not be highly regarded among some fans of the series, but it's not all that bad either. Even with its problems, it's still decent entertainment.

17,poolandrews,Not the best.,5,8 April 2007,"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge starts as Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) has a terrifying nightmare from which he wakes up covered in sweat, the nightmares continue & become more vivid. Eventually he wanders into his basement & in the furnace finds a glove with razors for fingers that belonged to child killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), Freddy plagues Jesse's nightmares & Jesse's fear of Freddy gives him power. The power to take over Jesse's body & kill for him, Jesse doesn't know what to do as the bodies start to pile up once more on Elm street...Directed by Jack Sholder this is standard teen horror fare that doesn't really come close to some of the other entries in the series. The script by David Chaskin has an OK central idea to it as Freddy tries to possess Jesse so he can carry on killing but the whole film is misjudged & ends up a bit of a mess. For a start there's the often mentioned homosexual references & feel to it which are quite apparent if you look out for them, there's the fact some of the set-pieces are far from scary & in fact come across as ridiculous especially the killer budgie scene which had me in fits of laughter as it attacks it's owners & tries to be menacing before it explodes in a flash of feathers! Then there's the bit when the gay coach who is attacked by killer tennis & basket balls before he is tied to the showers, stripped naked & has his bum whipped by towels! Then there's the terrible 'love conquers all' ending in which Jesse's girlfriend admits her love for a scarred Freddy & even kisses him to try & get the 'real' Jesse back. The kills are boring, there's not much of a body count, the plot is all over the place & the line between dreams, hallucination & reality in this one is never really established that well. Having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & is watchable if only for the unintentional laughs & Freddy in this one is used sparingly, he is still portrayed as a scary villain rather than some comic anti-hero & as such doesn't have lots of one jokey liners.Director Sholder does OK & this has a great opening sequence which lulls you into a false sense of security by starting off like a normal day as a school bus picks up & drops various pupils but then turns nasty as Freddy suddenly ends up driving the bus through the desert, it's the most effective part of the film in my opinion which the rest of it doesn't live up to. The scares just don't really work here & the gore is nothing special, there are a few slashings, Freddy rips the top of his head off to reveal his brain & there's an OK scene where Freddy literally rips himself out of Jesse's body. There is far more naked male skin on show than female & far more scenes set in the boys locker room than the girls...With a reasonable sounding budget of about $3,000,000 A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is well made & has decent enough production values although there's not too much style to it & overall it's a tad forgettable. The acting isn't great, I'd say average at best.A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is probably as low as the entire series got, it's maybe just about worth a watch but it's nothing special. Followed by the much improved A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The first of many (mostly lackluster) sequels to Wes Craven's classic is also one of the most different, with some kitschy elements and a gay subtext that has caused many these days to champion it. I think it's a better watch now than it was when I was a teenager and saw it for the first time with certain expectations. But that isn't to say it's a good movie or a good sequel. I don't believe it is either of those things, really, but I do think it has some merit that at least warrants a look for anyone not seeking another by-the-numbers Elm Street sequel. Aside from the subtextual stuff to chew on, there's some silly and campy moments that provide some chuckles. The Freddy here is not as scary as in the first film but not as corny as he would be in the later sequels when he was quoting Nintendo slogans. Probably the best thing about this to me are the interesting visuals the director and special effects teams conjure up. The script doesn't make a lot of sense but the surreal aspects will likely keep the interest of those who are generally bored by these types of movies.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

20,Boba_Fett1138,Nothing too bad.,6,25 September 2009,"You can pretty much expect this sequel being much weaker than the original. But it doesn't mean that this movie is a complete waste of time. It definitely has some entertainment value and is watchable as a sequel to the 1984's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"".The movie perhaps picks a strange approach with its story. It's however obvious that they at least tried to be original with it, making this movie different from its original. It still has pretty much the same atmosphere though, which is a good thing. Yet at the same time it's story just isn't ever convincing enough to allow the movie to work out.As an horror it's also really lacking in some good scares and some well staged gore. The movie is lacking in its moments but luckily there is still Freddy Kreuger who compensates for this and adds some nice touches to the movie. He still is one of the best villainous characters ever appeared on film. Without his presence the movie would had been just extremely poor. It shows how great Robert Englund is with the character!Of course it's a rather pointless sequel but as a movie this one really isn't too bad to watch. It's an average typical genre movie from the ' 80's, that is watchable enough by all standards.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Revenge for what, anyway?",5,31 July 2010,"Five years after(which makes it strange that hardly anyone seems to remember or look for warning signs) the events of the first, a new family has moved into Nancy's house. The teen is Jesse, and he is stalked in his dreams by something familiar to the audience(and he's still not taunting or talking much)... but he has different plans this time. He wants into the real world, and all he needs is a vessel. Sound different? It is. The concept is actually my favorite thing about it. With a better execution, this could have been amazing. This has few nightmares, and only one of them is memorable(and it's burned off as the opening). The approach is that he is scared and doesn't want to be taken over, and I think the way it was in Christine would have been better, and easier to get into. With that said, the way it's handled leads to strong, chilling moments of psychological terror. If the relationships and the characters(and if they were less obnoxious, the only ones I liked were the two leads, and just barely at that) were developed more than the bare minimum(as in the original), they would be greater, and there wouldn't be so few of them. This has the same director of photography, and it is filmed well. The script isn't bad for how fast this came(only one year later), and this is creepy, with occasional disgusting and sexual traits, if it is also at times merely bizarre instead. It can be genuinely funny. The eerie theme is gone. This doesn't build an atmosphere or surprise you the way the '84 one did. The running time is only 79 minutes sans credits, and it didn't grab me for a third of it. There is a lot of disturbing content, a little brutal, gory, bloody violence and a tad of swearing. The Ultimate Collector's Edition 7-Disc DVD set comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to fans of the idea behind it and of fantasy horror; those who like the Craven version of the tale and the being would do best to skip this. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
22,view_and_review,1428 Elm Street is Occupied Again,4,27 July 2019,"1428 Elm St. has new residents after five years of vacancy. You know how it goes in scary movies: creepy house can't sell, price is significantly reduced, it gets a buyer. The Walshes are the buyers in this scary sequel. Not even fully unpacked, the oldest child, Jesse (Mark Patton), starts having these night terrors involving you-know-who but the dreams don't result in Jesse's death. In fact, Freddy propositions Jesse. He would like to use Jesse to do some ol' fashion killin'.The first NMoES had clear cut rules: Freddy could only attack teenagers in their dreams. Nancy did bring Freddy into the world of the living in order to destroy him, which she did, but it wasn't a violation of the established rules. Now, in Freddy's Revenge, the rules are somewhat murky. The only one that needs to be sleep for Freddy to operate is Jesse. Once he sleeps Freddy uses his body but the control and power Freddy has over the real world is the same as if he were in a dream world. In other words, Freddy can still break the laws of physics and cause mysterious things to happen as if he was manipulating a dream. I don't like that.I can roll with the idea of Freddy controlling Jesse, that makes sense. I can't roll with the idea that he can manipulate the real world, even if it happens to be he is only causing his victims to hallucinate. I just don't like Freddy in the land of the awake.Another problem I had with the movie besides Freddy in real life was the leading lady, Lisa (Kim Myers). She was no Nancy Thompson. Nancy was strong, smart, and industrious. Lisa's go to move was to cry. OMG she was annoying. She was so weak and pathetic it was sickening. I think Freddy killed himself to get away from her whining and crying.If Michael Myers and Jason Voorhese got sequels you knew Freddy was going to get a sequel. I think Freddy's sequel was the worst of the three. Freddy was less active and less credible. Freddy is still on my Mount Rushmore of movie slashers even with this sorry sequel.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
23,Uriah43,The Nightmares Begin Again,5,12 May 2020,"Having recently moved into the same house as one of the victims in the original film, a teenage boy by the name of ""Jesse Walsh"" (Mark Patton) begins to have nightmares. Since he is new at school he doesn't have too many people to confide in until a fight erupts during physical education which pits him against another classmate named ""Ron Grady"" (Robert Rusler). After being punished by ""Coach Schneider"" (Marshall Ball) they then become friends. However, it's his new girlfriend ""Lisa Webber"" (Kim Myers) who learns of the most horrific nightmares due in large part to a diary they find in his house which was written by the female victim in the previous film. The only difference is that instead of wanting to kill Jesse, the monstrous apparition known as ""Freddy Krueger"" (Robert Englund) wants to possess him in order to continue his murderous rampage in the real world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film wasn't quite in the same league as its predecessor in part because the overall plot limited the nightmares to just one person. Likewise, none of the actors really stood out. It did, however, have some very good graphics which added to the overall ambience and for that reason I have rated it accordingly.

24,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Slightly undervalued effort which has some enjoyable elements,8,2 May 2016,"Moving into a new house on Elm Street, a teens' recurring nightmares about a scarred boogeyman are leading him to be the personal target of Freddy Krueger's resurrection and forces his friends to stop it from happening again.This one wasn't all that bad but is a slightly lower sequel. When this one works it's mostly about the individual, isolated scenes in here rather than working as a whole, and several of those scenes are quite a bit of fun. The beginning on the school-bus is a great way to start a movie and keep those from the first one remembering who Freddy is driving the panicked kids out into the desert where the ground gives way and he stalks them while left atop a dangerous looking precipice, the scenes of Freddy tormenting him and psychologically going after him and his family as well as how he becomes part of the possession is all kinds of fun The party scene, which is the film's great highlight, is definitely all sorts of fun here with the realistic way it plays out, from the house stalking and then out among the guests which is what really makes this one fun with all sorts of great action chasing them around and getting the panic of the scene down nicely, Also really great is that Freddy becomes a bit more of a psychological villain here,taking a little bit longer to start his rampage, but gets a great rampage full of great and interesting kills. Among the best is when Freddy emerges from another body by slashing his way through the abdomen and then walking through, with the shredded remains falling off of Krueger's back and shoulders. It looks bloody and painful, just the way it should be if Freddy Krueger was trying to escape from inside someone, and it also featured a couple cool ideas that add to the overall realness of it. Along with the fun finale in the chemical plant, there's a lot to like here over it's few flaws. The main issue here is the fact that it spends so long on building up the psychological aspects of him being targeted that there's hardly any action or kills for the first fifty minutes. It's still interesting but hardly really as fast-paced as it could've been as it has to deal with his psychological issues. Also, I think the redesigned facial make- up of Krueger is dreadful. It looks like his skin is even more fried than before, and I don't like it all that much. I miss the great looking make-up from the first film: he looked really creepy in that one. Here, it really doesn't do the trick. Still, beyond these issues there's not a whole lot else really wrong here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, rear male Nudity, and a clothed sex scene.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Will Lisa's love for Jesse be enough to help him overpower the demonic presence inside him? For some, this is the weakest entry in the series, thats number four for me, but this is surely the one with the most homo-erotic innuendo.Jesse has to be the campest hero ever seen in a horror movie, and his screams are something straight out or a Vic Reeves sketch, and the fact that he has a crush on an actress who looks like Meryl Streep just makes it worse.It's such a weird movie though. Birds explode, Jesse 'comes out' to his friend in his bedroom (quite literally)and the fact we hardly see Freddy is the biggest criticism of them all.It's not all bad.Freddy towel whips a man, There is some really camp bedroom disco dancing, And the funniest part of all, at a party, the parents decide to go to bed just a few feet away, and the kids think that playing music very loud is a good idea.Watch it for the amount of gay innuendo, and you will appreciate it just that little bit more.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Forsaking the dream logic of the first, Krueger seeks to posses Jesse's body (not that there's anything wrong with that, as Seinfeld would say).

No, this movie sucks (no pun intended) because it doesn't seem to care about a little thing called continuity.

It did have Freddy act dark and scary still, unlike later episodes where he was a comedian, but alas he wasn't in this one all that much.  What gets me is that this movie is said to have a lot of gay elements.  Really? I only saw the movie a few times as a kid so I guess I couldn't pick them up, so I can't really comment on them.  Though I do remember the main character Jesse had a girlfriend who tries to save him.  The trouble I had with this movie as a kid is that it is a bit boring as there aren't many dream sequences in this one and it isn't as menacing as the first one.  What passes for horror here...a bird escaping and going crazy?  No, this one just doesn't have the style and atmosphere the first one did.  The only real dream sequence that was even memorable was the first one in the bus.  It may be worth a look, but I won't recommend it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
28,Wuchakk,Solid continuation of the story; undeservedly maligned,6,30 October 2016,"Released in 1985 and directed by Jack Sholder, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" takes place five years after the original movie from the previous year. A family moves into Nancy's former house on Elm Street with the focus on teen Jesse (Mark Patton), as he attends a new school, develops relationships, including a girlfiend, Lisa (Kim Myer), and is increasingly possessed by the hellish specter, Freddy Krueger. Clu Gulager and Hope Lange play Jesse's parents while Robert Rusler plays his best friend. Marshall Bell is on hand as the gay gym teacher.Fans of the series tend to put down this first sequel, but I found it a perfectly fitting continuation of the story. We know from Part 3 that Nancy was off at college at this time so what's wrong with showing what's happening back on Elm Street with a new cast of characters? Myer is super-cute, even stunning in a young Meryl Streep kind of way while Patton is effective as the brooding, tormented Jesse. The long pool party sequence in the second half is a highlight and the idea of Freddy literally possessing a victim is unique to this installment. That said, they coulda done more with the female cast and there are some laughably cartoonish parts, like the bird episode. I also coulda done without the homosexual coach, but it happens.The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Palmdale and Fontana.GRADE: B- (6.5/10) ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie) Jesse wasn't gay; it's a myth perpetuated by people who read that INTO the script.Right out of the gate the movie shows that Jesse's interested in Lisa, a babe, ultimately 'fessing up to his love for her; and it's mutual. Despite Jesse's torment from Freddy increasingly trying to possess him, he still can't resist getting on the floor with cutie Lisa to make out at the pool party; and only stops because of Freddy manifesting the monster tongue. Jesse understandably freaks out and escapes to Grady's house (who's grounded) and asks if he can stay the night while Grady keeps guard on him; he even warns him not to go to sleep because he might be possessed and do something evil, like murder.The only legitimately gay element of the movie was the aforementioned subplot about the homosexual gym teacher who hanged out at a S&M bar, which was revealed by Grady at the very beginning. Of course, the coach is nixed by the halfway point.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

30,StevePulaski,"Subtext satisfies, scares demise",5,14 October 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge comes as a surprise for anyone expecting the series to keep with its reality-bending, surrealist brand of horror that Wes Craven pioneered for the first film. However, little did people know at the time of its release, this is the film that would hereby kickoff a series of sequels to the classic 1984 film by playing ""musical directors,"" with New Line Cinema acquiring new directors and writers to to etch their own sort of spin on Craven's classic, dream-haunter.Out of all the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, the first one has a chance at being the most substantial one in the regard that the subtext is more interesting than anything in the way of character relations or legitimate scares. In addition, it also may be the slowest eighty-two minute film I've ever watched, taking its time building up its situation in a way that doesn't feel like the slowburn pacing Craven used for the first film as much as it feels like being just plain slow.The story revolves around Jesse (Mark Patton), who has been waking up soaked in his own sweat for the past several weeks, worrying his family and his best friend Lisa (Kim Myers). Little does anyone, let alone Jesse, know that he is being haunted by Freddy Krueger, the same demon who terrorized Nancy and her friends in the previous film. The shakeup to the story this time around is that Freddy doesn't exactly haunt his victims in their sleep as much as he serves as a repressed identity or sensation - or like a closeted skeleton, ambiguity intended - for Jesse. The repressed identity in question is homosexual and the gay subtext is so blatant in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 that you could probably watch the film with the sound off and probably get it. Jesse now has the choice to confront the metaphorical and physical demon inside of him as he slowly eats away at his confidence and his mental health throughout the course of the film.A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 gets considerable subversive points for being a film that dared to feature a significant level of homoeroticism - including a scene in an S&M bar as well as a clearly homosexual murder - in a narrative where you'd least expect. If nothing else, this is where Freddy became less a nightmarish boogeyman that just seemed to appear in one's head out of nowhere and more a metaphorical albatross that contributed to the slow and painful deterioration of a young person over time.Director Jack Sholder and writer David Chaskin do all they can to give this gay subtext weight, and the film largely remains interesting for that one idea. To boot, Chaskin infuses one of the best scenes of the franchise, which is the opening sequence here, taking place on your average school bus ride through a typical suburban neighborhood. The nonchalant, unassuming nature of the film that slowly descends into a dimly lit, grim suburban nightmare is the perfect visual representation for the series itself, and cinematographers Jacques Haitkin and Christopher Tufty make this scene's escalation slow and delightfully unexpected.Through all the unexpectedness that Sholder and Chaskin manage to create, they do, however, forget the most fundamental inclusion to the narrative that, if anything, is the most expected and that's making this a horror film. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 is so depressingly mild and largely devoid of scares that it makes everything else questionable as a result. There's no validity to the suspense, nor the immersive buildup here that was in the first film, so what entails is a film that has a real identity crisis in terms of whether or not it caters to substance or caters to its genre.A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge pleasantly takes the series in a different, deeper direction, but its lack of scares and sudden change of rules as to how and why Freddy haunts his victims is a bit jarring, especially when Freddy is such a non-character in his own film.Starring: Mark Patton Kim Myers, Robert Englund, and Robert Rusler.

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Pretty sad,5,11 November 2003,"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, the second installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and probably the worst in the series. I was lucky enough to get the boxed DVD set of A Nightmare on Elm Street series and I got to see all the sequels. I think this is the sequel that I disliked the most, just because it didn't at all add up to what the first film was. It was like watching a cheesy teenager show with a twist of Nightmare on Elm Street. The kid who's the new victim, Jesse, is like Kevin Bacon's character in Footloose where he's not excepted by anyone, now just mix Footloose with Nightmare on Elm Street and you've got A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. The story had potential, but it just failed.Jesse is the new kid in town and he has moved into Nancy Thomson's old house. Not too soon is he having the same horrific nightmares that Nancy was having about Freddy Krueger. Jesse confides in his neighbor/crush, Lisa, she doesn't believe him until she starts having the nightmares herself. She researches Freddy and finds out that he is after Jesse's body and wants to take it over. But she may be too late when he does enter Jesse's body and is after her and all the rest of the kids at Jesse's high school.A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge isn't bad, just compared to the series, yeah, it's the worst in that category. The story had something, but it wasn't delivered well. But just think about what A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was compared too with it's first film that was an ultimate classic. So maybe that's why we have such a problem with the film. But I would recommend it if you wanna see the sequels, but if you're watching it without knowing the first story, I don't think you'll enjoy it.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The demon attempts to possess Jesse Walsh in order to continue his havoc onto the real world.The usual dreamy plot continues in this sequel, with lots of people hiding, slashing and screaming. The gore factor is on par as in the previous film and the acting was, like the first, pretty campy and sub-par. The overall atmosphere and cinematography of the film have this lazy, dreamy and emotionless feeling, probably wanting to give the audience the impression of a dream, but still somewhat dull to me.The plot is pretty fast-paced and you will get a few good screams out of this one, but, it is riddled with plot holes and ambiguous scenes.

34,thesar-2,Freddy's real revenge is making you watch this. You'll have real nightmares.,1,3 January 2010,"Well, this shouldn't be a big surprise: follow up an inventive and original idea with a lame, horrid sequel.A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is an abomination, even in 1980s horror franchise sequels. It's incoherent, irresponsible, inconsistent and just plain horribly made.Five years after the event of Part 1, or just one in real life, a new family moves into the Elm street house where Nancy supposedly went crazy after watching her boyfriend get butchered across the street. I'm going to stop here and say here's one of the biggest problems of the movie. Did the writer or director even watch the first one? She did NOT see her boyfriend die, just heard and knew about it.Anyways, Jesse (Patton) is a very troubled, wacky and overheated teen who befriends a girl, Lisa (Myers) and a thug/jock Ron (Rusler) while having bad dreams. Apparently, he's inherited the ""spirit"" of Fred Krueger since he lives in the original movie's house and Fred wants Jesse to kill for him. Why? No real reason other than Fred likes to kill.See, the original made sense. It was a basic revenge type story whereas Fred Krueger murdered children, the parents took matters into their own hands and burned Fred to death. Only, Fred came back in the form of nightmares to seek vengeance against the children of the parents responsible. Here, he only wants to kill just about anyone.And here in lies one of the most troubling aspects: Fred(dy) Krueger wants to ""use"" Jesse as a portal to kill others, but he seem to be doing fine on his own. Such as, moving objects, windows, doors, gym equipment without the use of a host. Why, oh why, did he need Jesse? And where was the real aspect of the nightmare presented carefully in #1? ""A Nightmare"" part of the title really only suggests that sometimes Jesse dreams of Fred, but basically the majority of the movie takes place in the real world.Again, I ask, did they actually watch the first movie? No journal was mentioned in #1, but they conveniently brought one in here. The mother died (or did she?) in the first one in BED, UPSTAIRS and not in the living room as mentioned here. And Freddy has to be ""pulled"" out of a dream, he literally cannot cut himself out as this new ""myth"" states.I realize I am looking too deep into this movie, but as a true Freddy Krueger fan, I am ashamed this one is part of the series. Let's look at the idiocracies in this feature: I'm supposing it was ""ghost"" form, but Freddy locks all the doors at Lisa's house in order to attack. Why the heck would there be a lock on the outside of the parents' bedroom door? Sure this might sound petty, but to me, this was just lazy film-making. They didn't even try. Also, why go after the gym teacher? Was Freddy homophobic, or just the writers had something against gays? In one scene, Jesse wanders from his house into a bar, I'm assuming is a gay bar, but there's other things happening there as well. Next thing you know, Gym teacher is making Jesse do laps and take a shower in the middle of the night. Why? Well, I guess the writer equates homosexuals with pedophiles. That's always a huge misconception and just plain ignorance. Regardless, it just doesn't make sense, like the rest of the movie. Especially the ""love conquers all"" ending. Seriously? Wes Craven stated he wanted nothing to do with this mess. I don't doubt that and I am proud of him for that. The special effects were awful (including some off the wall baby/dogs???), the great score of the original was gone (always a mistake during a franchise,) the acting was horrible and way, WAY over the top, the homophobia was rampant and unnecessary and the climax and finale were just terrible.There are NO redeemable qualities of this picture (see the 1980s ""Marty Mcfly"" dance segment) and I am very glad to say that some people still had faith in Freddy, i.e. they went ahead and made #3 which was 30 times better. (On a side note: despite all previously stated, this is still not the worst one – SEE, well actually, Don't SEE #6: Freddy's Dead. Nevertheless, any true human should watch #1 and leapfrog over this to #3 and continue.)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

36,Robert_duder,Ohhh so Freddy's Revenge was to make a horrible sequel...I get it,5,22 August 2011,"You have to try pretty hard to disappoint me in a horror film. Considering the greatness of the original film they must have really screwed up the recipe for this barely watchable sequel and there are some glaring fatal flaws that made this one simply bad. First of all if they couldn't get Nancy (Heathen Langenkamp) to come back they should have waited until they could. This film barely ties into the first film and they really have to try hard to tie that into together but using Nancy's diary from 'five years' earlier. Second of all...where in the hades was Freddy? Freddy Kreuger, the legendary killer, the focus of all these films is hardly in this movie. He spends the whole time terrorizing and possessing the main character that you hardly every see Englund in his classic role. In the entire movie Englund's Freddy is in thirteen minutes of it?!?! That is a terrible decision on the film makers part. Thirdly they completely eliminated the haunting melody of the Nightmare On Elm Street theme that was used in every single other instalment. So instead of the horror film we all love we get to watch a sub-par over actor run around whining and screams for 80+ minutes.God bless Mark Patton for not carrying on his acting career too far after this. Patton plays Jesse the possessed youngster who apparently is only a target because he lives in Nancy's room. He has the body, Freddy has the brain as he says in one of the only memorable moments in the film. Patton takes emotions to new levels but not in a good way. He cries and screams and whines and its overwhelming and you want to slap him. Premiering in this film is Kim Myers as Patton's girlfriend. She looks so dazed through the whole film and has very little personality and chemistry with Patton whatsoever. Robert Rusler is at least a little better as the cocky future victim Grady. Rusler should have been given more time on screen and also the lead role because I think he would have done better. Sadly I can't even comment on Robert Englund's performance as Freddy because his role is barely a cameo and yet the entire film is supposed to be about him? I can't say he was good or bad because he just wasn't even important in this and that's sad and stupid.Wes Craven outright refused to come back for this and that's a shame because maybe he could have saved it. Then again it bodes well for future instalments that they did the worst one right off the bat. Jack Sholder wasn't a stranger to horror so I guess we have to blame someone else. I mean he could only do so much with the script. Now the reason I am giving this film some sort of redeemable score is because there are still some really solid special effects in the film that I think A Nightmare On Elm Street series should be applauded for because they often did it on low budget and minimal CGI unlike nowadays. There is still some pretty gruesome kills but its also completely twisted to have the main character and 'hero' also essentially be the killer. If you're a fan of the series or if you're just determined to watch them all then you have to watch this. If anything it'll make you look more highly on future instalments. Truth be told though you could literally skip this entirely and not miss anything whatsoever because the real #2 sequel in my mind was actually part 3 but we will get to that. 5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
37,bowmanblue,Do you like 'short shorts?',7,13 July 2014,"Well, if you ever have a small appreciation for short shorts, then you'll get an added bonus out of Part II of the long-standing horror franchise. Because, believe it or not, the film was written with a 'homosexual subtext' and, if you look closely, you may just spot it.I don't know whether that's the main reason why people think that Part II is probably the most inferior of all the sequels, but there's many an Elm Street fan who skips this one over the rest. However, I can't really get the hate.We join Freddy in his seemingly never ending quest to do away with the children of America by invading their dreams. Here though, he needs a helping hand from an unwitting teenage boy called Jessie, who the spiky-fingered one regularly takes over (or 'has' as Jessie desperately puts it) when he wants the boy to do his murderous bidding. Part II was made before Freddy became such a figure of fun. In the later movies there's far more tongue in cheek moments. Here, it's pure horror. Perhaps people don't like this one because Freddy doesn't invade so many dreams, choosing to inhabit a mortal boy instead and make him do the killing (technically).It does have a different 'feel' to it among the rest of the franchise. The series' creator, Wes Craven, came back on board for Part III to 'steer it back to its original direction.'

38,ThomasDrufke,Re-Birth,3,23 October 2017,"Well, Freddy most certainly did get his revenge with this film. Sadly, none of the cast members from the original film returned for Freddy to give his revenge to. In all, the second film in this iconic franchise isn't anything new besides a few scares and Freddy doing Freddy things. But even to that point, it's not always Freddy wearing the glove and committing the crimes, and it diminishes the effect when it's not him.The one thing this film does do is build the mythology around Freddy Krueger's history on Elm Street. Of course he would come back and haunt the same house that Nancy Thompson lived in, now inhabited by the Walsh family. His main target, a timid and constantly nervous, Jesse Walsh. Freddy has a different relationship with Jesse than he did with Nancy, and it just doesn't have the same emotional impact as it did the first time around.It's the same old high school drama, bullying, and sexual tension that plagues the teens in this sequel, and those things nearly outweigh Freddy's screen time. Like any good horror villain, he spends his time working in the shadows, but that only works when the horror is amplified at the important times of the film. That's not the case here.The one incredible moment from this film is Freddy's re-birth sequence. Terrifying and visually impressive, that scene is easily one of the most powerful moments of the series. Overall, this is simply one of those horror films you'll watch on cable, and nothing you need to spend valuable time on.3.4/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
39,ericstevenson,Bad but not terrible,5,9 October 2017,"Freddy Krueger is back again! Wait, this is the first sequel so now he's just back. Anyway, this movie features Freddy possessing some guy named Jesse. I was confused as to how this even worked. I mean, he literally popped out of Jesse's body instead of possessing him. This movie is notable for being the one where Freddy gets the most kills. Most of them are done out of the dream world. Why doesn't he do that more often? He seems to be more powerful in the real world for some odd reason. He can even teleport.I do like how they feature Nancy's diary and don't just ignore her from the first film. She is the most iconic character from the franchise apart from Freddy of course. The budget was apparently only $3,000,000 so I will give this film props for looking nice. It still doesn't really have anything unique. The ending to the original ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was actually changed so that Freddy could come back giving us the sequels expected from a slasher movie. It's mostly just more of the same. **",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

41,Bored_Dragon,"Weird, awkward and awesome",9,23 August 2018,"I'm reading the reviews and do not understand why people hate this movie so much. Not only is it a worthy successor to the original, but in some elements it is somewhat better. The story and characters are better developed, it has a good pace and keeps the attention from start to finish, and some scenes are unforgettable. OK, I can understand that die-hard fans of 80's slasher horrors might be disappointed with total absence of female nudity, replaced with several indisputably gay scenes (based on hilarious dance on the bed scene and closing drawer with ass, as well as the scene in the school bathroom, I would dare to bet that the screenwriter and/or director are gay), but even those gay scenes were done superbly, and some moments in the film, as for example the scene with birds and scenes in the school bus, are among the best in the genre. There's a bit less Freddy than in the first movie, but it doesn't bother me. I prefer quality over quantity, so I prefer a movie with a well-developed plot, with occasional well-measured and effective kills, over two hours of pointless slaughter, like we have in ""Friday the 13th"".9/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

44,Dr_Coulardeau,"Even through the eyes of a boy, Freddy is fearful and frightening",10,1 February 2007,"The first sequel of a film like this A Nightmare on Elm Street is probably the most difficult task, especially if you change directors. It has to be in the line of the first film and yet change a few things to make it nothing but a repeat. The character of Freddy Krueger is kept with his three distinctive elements : the right hand four finger claws, the hat and the black and red striped pullover, plus of course his ugly mug. But then we move. First the main character is a boy something like a junior or senior in high school, so not really a boy anymore. But yet the boyish side is emphasized by a hairless body, shiny and pure skin, a skin that is widely shown and slowly brushed up and down by the camera. And that's the change. The camera really centers on his body, his skin, his flesh even, except of course his front sexual parts per se. Then it uses gym scenes and even locker room and shower scenes, but once again with restraint. Very little nudity and when there is some backside scenes it is in a very traumatic situation : the gay sports teacher who is tortured and whipped in the nude of course, tied up to the showers, while the boy in the nude too is shown slightly in some darkness and flittingly. Many scenes of the boy in bed only wearing his underwear, never really ambiguous but always sexy even if once again flittingly. Then some more elements are added : his friendship with another boy who is the rather of the macho type but who does not seem afraid of a masculine friendship. Both are victimized by the gay sports teacher on the football field a couple of times and in the end the boy, Jesse, will come to ask for help from his friend, Grady, and the first reaction will be nearly openly gay even if denied in some side remark, and Freddy will kill Grady through, from inside the body of Jesse : if that is not a repressed homosexual desire, what is ? And before Jesse had gone to a leather bar and had been literally kidnapped by the gay sports teacher and it is then later in the showers that Freddy again will kill this openly gay character from within the body of Jesse. If one case is a coincidence, two are not and that is the main change of this film from a girl-centered vision of fear to a boy-centered vision. In fact we must understand that Freddy is the real character questioned here. He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires. But this can also be nothing but a tactic from Freddy to push Jesse into killing, to titillate him where it tickles and where Jesse does not really want to be tickled, though when Freddy forces Jesse away from his girlfriend at the very moment when he was getting excited enough to let himself slip into some sex can be seen as the revulsion of Freddy for that type of sex or as the fear of Jesse in front of that type of sex, which would lead to believing that Freddy managed to get back into existence through the homosexual desire of Jesse and at the same time his resistance to this sexual appeal. But that is a real change in that kind of horror films : to take a point of view that focuses onto a boy, his desires, his fears, and his anxiety, all of it emphasized by a castrating authoritarian father and a loving, maybe too much, mother. We must keep in mind that this is a common situation for many boys when they turn sixteen or seventeen. In no way is this sequel lower and less intense than the first episode. Note finally the use of an old abandoned factory to give some density to Freddy's old personality and past, but also to open another chapter in that exploration of fear : the fear we can feel in front of and inside those old factories that seem in many ways haunted. That is a dimension Stephen King has used over and over again in so many of his books and films. Nothing really new but something definitely effective, at least by reminding the audience of other frightening scenes in other films. Then the evaluation of that reference is a question of date to know who used it first and who is a copycat or an imitator, who can anyway also be a developer.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
45,filipemanuelneto,"It is not as bad as they say, but it is better not to make comparisons with the initial film.",4,3 April 2021,"After a good start, the ""Nightmare"" franchise quickly got off track with this film, which is quite stupid in its premises and has a very weak script. However, the best way to enjoy this film is not to compare it with the previous film and not to think too much about the script. It is a raw film and has scenes that can shock the most sensitive, and it works reasonably nowadays if we give some tolerance to the obvious flaws.In this film, a new family goes to live in the house where the main events of the previous film took place, and the young teenager from the new family quickly begins to suffer from many nightmares. It is, again, Freddy Krueger in action, but this time determined to possess the boy and to do his crimes through his hands. Everything else is quite predictable, with the boy being misunderstood by almost everyone as he tries to fight an evil he doesn't quite know how to defeat.The film is not that bad, and director Jack Sholder shows that he wants to live up to the film that preceded it, without, however, making more of the same. In fact, there are disturbing scenes, and the beginning is promising. However, one of the film's biggest problems is predictability: as the film advances, the audience understands everything that is going to happen and is able to foresee the dangers and scares from miles away. It is also a less than atmospheric film, where the palpable tension of the first film being rarely felt.The cast is another problem of this film. It is true that it is the only film in the franchise where the hero is male, and I even found this change interesting, but the fact is that the character is very poorly developed, does not have any kind of charisma and does not arouse any sympathy. It also seems to me that Mark Patton was not the right actor for the character, as he seems lost in the film, and most of the time he does nothing but cry and mourn constantly. The rest of the cast is there because it has to be, even though I liked the performance of Kim Myers, a young actress who knew how to grab her character and give it personality, even though she can't do much more than she did. In the middle of all this, it is Robert Englund who stands out and gives the villain of the series another film that certainly helps to make it memorable and iconic.Technically, it is a discreet and notable film. Cinematography is the standard and is within what we could demand, but I didn't notice anything particular about it, nor in the sets or costumes, which seem to take advantage of some material from the previous film. I didn't get to say this in the review of the previous film, it was a forgetfulness of mine that the passing of the pen didn't allow me to amend, but I think the makeup department deserves applause for the way it idealized and concretized Krueger's makeup and made it look like real and grotesque burns.

The introduction is nearly ridiculous and looks like a bad horror movie from the fifties ! Then, the main plot is not very airtight : why Freddy needs a body if he is able so far to twist reality and dreams ? The idea for Freddy to inhabit a innocent soul could have been great (remember Bob and Holland Palmer too) but as told, it's very hard to understand what really happens Jesse seems to die a lot of times but comes back fit later ??? If the special effects are impressive (Freddy's arrival like Alien's Chestburster !), the director fails to give rhythm and tension all along the movie and the grand finale is like the beginning, too much !!!

48,BaronBl00d,Pointless Sequel,3,8 March 2005,"Well, the title says it all. Guess who is back in town to terrorize the young, coming of age youth living on or near the vicinity of Elm Street? If you said Freddy Kruger, you'd be right! Nothing unexpected here except as sequels go, this one is really pretty weak. A new family move into ""the house"" where a girl had previously gone mad. The teenage boy, played with little conviction by Mark Patton, starts to see visions of Freddy who wants to recruit him to kill. We see lots of the same images as in the first one, but what we don't see is any of the sense of style, menace, or suspense that was used in the original. Why? This film was directed by Jack Sholder - not a household name nor a very competent director at this stage in his career. Wes Craven did not make the sequel and it shows. The death scenes are not very graphic or even scary. There is a bizarre wrap-a-round story about Freddy driving a bus, a huge party at a house with loads of stupid teen stereotypes, and a sadistic coach that spends his nights at a gay bar wearing leather. OK, I guess. Kim Myers plays the female love interest, and she is very easy on the eyes if nothing else. None of the actors - including Robert Englund - stand out. Clu Gulager and Hope Lange(my, how the mighty have fallen) appear as the parents of Patton. Englund doesn't have a lot of meat in this role. Some of his lines seem very strained. Although populated with ridiculous scenes a plenty, two stand out for me. First, the coach is in a locker room where all kinds of physical equipment start moving all over the place. It's a real hoot - not even close to being scary. The zenith; however, of ridiculous scenes is when Patton and family, after having just covered up what appear to be two lovebirds, see the cage rock back and forth and the birds spontaneously combust. It looked like an interactive game of asteroids! The most amazing thing about this film is that it did not kill this series.

He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves.

This time Freddy's victim is Jesse (a skinny boy with gay tendencies). Soon after Jesse and his family moved to Nancy Thompson's house, strange things started to happen (an exploding parrot, weird nightmares, etc.) and led Jesse to think he was going insane.Freddy's plan is to ""possess"" Jesse and kill everyone on his way in order to spread the terror again as a part of his revenge against the parents of Springwood.SPOILERS The cast is somewhat interesting. Mark Patton delivers a bizarre but believable performance. The gay subliminals totally work for his character. Kim Myers also gives a good performance as the loving girlfriend that shows temper in the difficult situations. She discovers that Nancy wasn't crazy at all and that Fred Krueger wasn't only a myth. Robert Englund delivers a great performance; probably among his bests. He gives a dark and sinister personality to Freddy. I really dug his physical performance in the pool party massacre. The direction is good. The use of bright colors as part of the art direction on some non-important situations, combined with creepy and dark settings; make this a visually stunning slasher. Craven creates a world of fantasy and terror based on nightmares. There are very memorable moments in this movie that now are ""classics"" in the Slasher sub-genre. Freddy coming out of Jesse's chest is a great scene and now a favorite among the ANOES fans. But the most memorable scene in the movie has to be the pool party massacre. Freddy Krueger comes to slaughter as many teens as he can and finish with a rock on phrase: ""you're all my children now"". The scene is an important moment in the series because it's the only time you will see him attacking teenagers in the real world and in the best possible way. Great scene.""Freddy's Revenge"" is the movie that stands alone from the other movies from the franchise because it is strange and not exactly 100% a slasher movie. Sure, we have the typical ""one by one death scenes"" but that isn't enough to consider this among the pile of slasher flicks from the good 80's. There are some unusual subplots and a dramatic tone that isn't very common in the series. Some scenes ask for dramatic performances. A highly underrated and bashed by fans sequel. 7/10. Freddy's Revenge deserves a watch for trying something different.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
52,Anonymous_Maxine,Don't let the Fredbugs bite! HA!,4,28 January 2004,"WOW that was clever. So anyway, as I go back and watch all of those classic old horror films, I increasingly find myself wondering if there is ever again going to be a time when they can be scary again. Sure, today's horror films have had something of a numbing affect on modern audiences, at least as far as being affected by the films of the 80s, but surely those movies were scary back then. I just find myself wondering how that ever was.
Now, it's obvious that there are a lot of things that have to be overlooked in order for a film like A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 to be scary again, not the least of which is the difference in high school fashion, which is bordering on being actually shocking, as well as the acting, which was clearly not high on a filmmaker's list of objections back then. The problem, I think, is not things like that, but rather things that I assume were meant to be taken as normal by earlier audiences.Let's say, for example, that you are able to look past the 80's-ness of  the music that Jesse Walsh puts on when he is forced by his father to go up to his room and unpack in the house that he hates so much. The much higher obstacle is the antics that he engages in while cleaning his room. He puts on some sunglasses that I won't take the time to describe since my words can not do justice to the goofiness of them, and then he proceeds to dance around his room, singing into a broom handle and throwing his clothes into his drawers (pausing momentarily, as though proud of this monumental act of defiance) and then tapping the drawers closed with his butt as he dances. WOW. Did kids really do stuff like this? Or is this something like the American Pie movies, where movie executives create movies with teenagers acting the way THEY think they should act, whether because this is how they think kids are or because they think this will bring in the biggest profit (my money's on the latter, by the way)? And either way, is there really any way that you can watch a scene like this and then be actually frightened by anything that happens later in the movie? Or how about this. Jesse's gym teacher is evidently really into dressing up in leather and then hanging out in bars where high school boys are able to walk in and order a beer without showing any ID. I'll leave aside all of the immediate red flags that pop up about the teacher dressing in leather in a joint that is apparently full of drunk teenage boys. We soon see this teacher (still dressed in leather) punishing Jesse by making him run laps around the gym back at school. How we got back to campus, I can't say I noticed. After telling Jesse to hit the showers, he heads back to his office, and then calmly watches as basketballs and tennis balls and whatnot fly off of the walls at him like bullets. Okay, so I was in hysterics BEFORE the jump-ropes tied themselves around his wrists and dragged him into the showers, his clothes ripped off along the way. Just the balls flying at him was funny enough, but then he finds himself tied up naked and facing the walls, and get this, towels pick themselves up and start whipping his bare ass!!! Can you imagine??? This HAS to have been a joke. I understand the need for comic relief in the movies, but I don't know, that's a little too low-brow. It was bad enough to ask the audience to look past that dancing scene a little earlier and then still find something scary in the movie.So that being said, I'd like to go on and talk about what it was in this movie that frightened me out of my chair. Or maybe I should just talk about the uncomfortable scenes. A review of the things that are still scary would be about six words long (and by the way, those six words can be found in the summary line above). The thing that I liked about the first sequel in this seemingly undying horror saga is the way that it adds more to the psychological element of the original premise of the films. Having a horror movie villain that resides in the dreams of his villains is a very good way to avoid the trap of having a stereotypical knife-wielding killer who relentlessly purses his victims, a genre that was started on a large scale with Halloween, and which went precipitously downhill from there. Jesse Walker and his family have moved into the house from the original film, and Jesse finds the diary of the girl who lived in his room, who you might remember from the last film. They throw in another little obstacle for the scariness of the rest of the movie, asking you to believe that even the most basic police investigation failed to turn up the DIARY of the girl who went CRAZY. But I guess it WAS pretty hidden, sitting there in plain sight on the shelf in the closet. So anyway, Jesse finds the girl's diary, reads it for fun, starts to get creeped out when it starts talking about Freddy and the kid getting killed across the street and how now Freddy wants to come and kill her. Surely her psychologist would have been interested in reading this. (spoilers) So Freddy now begins to get into Jesse's head and thus begins a spiraling whirlwind of madness as he struggles for his life and people start turning up dead all around him. But there is a definite level of cleverness in this sequel, which is impressive because despite the fact that almost every element of the film itself is obsolete by today's standards, such cleverness was not very necessary to the horror movie audiences of the 80s.
In the original film, Freddy turns up and is able to attack his victims in their dreams while they sleep, killing them in real life at the same time. This is an extension of the old saying that if you have a dream that you're falling and you don't wake up before you land, you'll die in real life because your body will think that it's dead and your heart will stop or something. This isn't true, by the way. I've had dreams where I'm falling off  a huge building to the sidewalk below, landed on my back and then looked around as people gathered around me, probably marveling that I was still alive and awake. I even had a dream once that I fell off a ship, sank like a stone to about 150 feet in crystal clear water, watching the ship get smaller and smaller on the surface of the water above me, landed on my back, and lay there staring and the ship and marveling at my sudden ability to breathe underwater. Okay, so back to the movie. Rather than turning up in dreams to kill his victims, Freddy has gotten into Jesse's head and has managed to take control of his body. Jesse finds himself witnessing horrible murders, and then when they're over, he finds the blood (as well as the Edward Scissorhands glove) on HIS hands. I think it would be useful to point out that not only is this a sequel, but a horror movie sequel, and a sequel to a horror film that was a huge success. Failure is almost prescribed. But I have to give credit for this clever twist on the original premise, which opens up more than enough possibilities for a whole second film to be made. I think that a lot of the reason that sequels to successful films so often fail is because they try so hard to extend the success of the original without adding enough new thought or ideas to make a second films worthwhile. See the Austin Powers films for a perfect example. A Nightmare On Elm Street 2, however, while undeniably a cheesy 80s horror film, is a goofy horror movie that is notable more for defying the almost inevitable cheesiness of the films of the time than for succumbing to it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
53,gwnightscream,Underrated 80's Horror Flick!,5,27 February 2012,"Robert Englund, Mark Patton, Kim Myers, Robert Rusler, Marshall Bell, Clu Gulager and Hope Lange star in this 1985 horror sequel. This sequel picks up 5 years after the events of the original with burned, child-killer, Freddy Krueger (Englund) haunting new teen on Elm Street, Jesse Walsh (Patton). Jesse has just moved to the neighborhood with his family and meets Lisa Poletti (Myers), a girl he drives to school with everyday.

This is one of the most underrated films that's basically the black sheep of the series. I've always liked it and don't think it should be so misjudged.

The main reasons I liked this one is because where Freddy(Robert Englund) made that phrase that really was chilling. When he encounters Jesse Walsh(Mark Patton), he tells him, ""You got the body, but I got the brains!"" Freddy wasn't kidding. Mark was just his puppet for killing people. I liked the part in the seduction scene between Lisa(Kim Myers) and Jesse, where Freddy's tongue appears. Then all you know what breaks loose. Freddy normally kills in dreams, this time he kills in the real world. Man this is messed up. That's why it's called ""Freddy's Revenge"". At least Jesse was able to fight his inner demons that haunted him thanks to Lisa. This movie was fine by me, there were some troubling scenes I noticed. Other than that, I liked it very well.

55,FiendishDramaturgy,"Disappointing, inferior sequel.",4,2 April 2004,"It had promise, but all you really see is what it could have been in comparison to what it was. This is far inferior to the original. But don't give up on the franchise yet! The Third installment is much, much better.I have to say this was a serious let-down after the first. Freddy's Revenge just lacks too much in the way of story in comparison to the original. Jesse Walsh has moved into the Thompson house with his family, they find Nancy's old diary and it's just terribly predictable from that point on. There are a few cool effects and some decent one-liners, but this movie is so far beneath the original that I can't praise it very well here.It is not possible to miss the fact that Wes Craven neither wrote nor directed this little stinker. His trademark signature is absent, and so is his creativity.SPOILERS AHEAD! This is the installment in which Freddy attempts possession of a victim, rather than the oblivious destruction of him. And through his possession, he attempts the cross-over between the Realm of Dreams and this one. It works for him, but unfortunately, not the movie.One of the major flaws with this chapter is in the prolific use of special effects which in no way begin to hide the obvious and notable lack of story, dialog and/or anything else of worth. To make it better would have been to explain things more; any things. Oh, it's not that the movie was difficult to follow. A child could have followed THIS story line. It's more that the story had potential which, due to lack of care and nurturing, was left to die on the vine. Actually, a film inspector, David Chaskin, wrote this Nightmare, due to a lack of funding and access to more creative people, according to the Nightmare on Elm Street Encyclopedia. New Line was still a fledgling company and they had no resources. Wes Craven had nothing to do with this one, and indeed, passed on it because of the low quality of script and overuse of special effects.""I think the point of Nightmare 2 was let's get a film going quickly."" Rachael Talalay, Production Assistant. This is the second red flag for this movie. Aside from not having real talent to do the film, it was rushed into production without a female lead. Instead, they brought in a feminine male lead, causing this film to be billed as a homo-erotic horror, which did little to boost ticket sales in the US.Flaw # 3 is that they broke the mold Wes Craven established and they produced a vastly inferior finished product. They tried to drag Freddy out of the Realm of Dreams and into this reality, thereby taking Craven's Freddy Bible, if you will, and tossing it out the window.Even Robert Englund, the STAR of these movies, clearly states that the whole idea was ludicrous.Now, to its credit, without Craven, they still managed to hold onto the franchise. It wasn't totally obliterated with this installment, and indeed, if you're not a die-hard Freddy fan, you may still enjoy watching this one for its campier moments. The First NOES was relentlessly suspenseful. This second NOES was nothing more than a mediocre popcorn movie.I, however, am a Freddy fan, and still can't give it more than a 4.2/10 and feel right about it.the Fiend :.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
56,Captain_Couth,Freddy's back to terrorize a confused teenage boy!,7,17 June 2004,"Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 (1985) was the second film in the Freddy Krueger series.  This time his main target is the son of a man who just but the Elm Street house.  Freddy preys on this sexually confused kid and forces him to do his bidding and uses him to serve his twisted needs.  Can poor Jesse over come the strong willpower of Freddy?  Will he be able to discover his true self?  Watch and find out, you'll be surprised! Strange stuff.What I liked about this film was the filmmakers tried to do something different, and it almost killed the series.  The plot and storyline was too complex and byzantine for you average horror film. Much of the film's hidden context and meaning would go over the heads of most horror film fans.  If Sigmund Freud were alive today he would've had a field day trying to figure out this one.

57,Stevieboy666,Low key entry,6,26 July 2018,"A Nightmare on Elm Street was surely one of the biggest and best horror movies of the 1980's, and that's quite an achievement. So part 2 comes as a bit of a surprise in that it is a much more basic film. There are some good special effects, just not as plentiful as the other movies in the franchise. And personally I liked that aspect of it, for me I think that the special effects became a bit TOO much of the series and detracted from the fear that the first two instalments generated. Neither do we have a wise cracking Freddy, something which, again. I felt went too far in the sequels. And lastly - minor spoiler! - we have a final boy, not a girl, which makes a change. 
It's nowhere near as bad as some reviews make out but unlike some of the other entries it doesn't leave much of an impression.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The storyline for this picture tells the tale of a family who moves into Nancy's house after the first film. The son in family starts having nightmares with the killer from the first film. As his parents start thinking drugs have entered his life, the teenage son will need to find a way to confront his killer and regain his sanity. This movie is directed by Jack Sholder (The Hidden) and stars Robert Englund (Hatchet), Christie Clark (Children of the Corn 2), Sydney Walsh (Point Break), Mark Patton (Family Possessions) and Kim Myers (Hellraiser IV). The storyline for this picture is a huge step back from the first film. I will say there's some classic scenes in this including an amazing opening on the bus . I had a hard time believing Jesse's girlfriend would believe his shenanigans as long as she did; but hey, she was committed.

This time, Freddy attempts to possess a teenage boy, to cause havoc in the real world, and can only be overcome if the boy's sweetheart can master her fear.What I didn't like about this, is that there was just to much talk talk going on with everything, somehow they still made it entertaining to watch.The acting is this movie was really dreadful from the whole cast, Freddy Himself didn't even seem to be that scary or creepy at all in this movie.Which bring me to the deaths, there are only two deaths in this movie (which was let down) and both of those deaths were terrible done not gory or nasty.This movie is not the worse of series but I am not saying it's a good movie but it is a least (Just about) watchable.I give this a movie 4/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

As such, the special effects are better, the shots are better, the music is better than the cheap synthesizer used in the first film. What is lacking is better acting. The Hero of this film never worked again, and you can kind of see why.The plot, such as it is, is that Jesse's moved into Nancy's old house, and Freddy is haunting his dreams, trying to take over his body so he can resume killing in the real world. Unlike the last movie, where Freddy could only attack people who were dreaming, in this film, Freddy can interact with the real world.

63,Foreverisacastironmess123,Freddy drives the bus.,7,19 December 2017,"Ok so for a start, I honestly never quite registered the big infamous gay undertones of this much-maligned sequel that everyone raves about so much until I heard it pointed out in some documentary or whatever, and I certainly never noticed it as a kid, I just thought it was a bit of a lame sequel that just happened to feature some very random s**t in it! That element of the movie has really been blown out of proportion, people make out that every little scene is a homoerotic metaphor of some kind, someone even suggested that of the unbelievably stupid scene where the parakeet goes crazy and attacks the cast before exploding like a Roman candle in a flurry of fire and pretty feathers! To me it's not at all that it's 'gay' that's the problem, but that it's so obnoxiously out of place, awkward and plain ridiculous to have that kind of thing stamped all over the sequel to what had been such an acclaimed and instant classic. And how it's done in this is so tacky and in the more blatant moments that everyone knows about it's right in your face, ""subtext"" my ass! It might have earned itself a little more consideration and respect over the years and I can understand why, it is a fun and entertaining campy effort in its own right, it's pure 80s and has an effective eerie score as well as still retaining the darker more menacing Freddy who talks little and sticks more to the shadows before he naturally progressed into the macabre crooked clown pop culture horror icon we all know and love, but at the end of the day make no mistake, this was never a worthy follow up to the masterful original and failed to live up to its premise and was a big 'ol step down in basic quality on pretty much every level... From my point of view it's not a bad movie, but it sure ain't a good Nightmare on Elm Street movie! For one thing it's fundamentally a story about possession, not nightmares, and barely touches upon the dream and die aspect that was so incredibly well realised in the first movie, and that was especially irksome. If Jessie sleeps people other than him die but that's as far as it goes.. It's the sequel that quite literally took the Nightmare out of Elm Street! To be totally fair though they couldn't have known about the lore that would come about with the later films in the series, but couldn't they have thought it through a little more and followed on the first movie's events just a little and done it so that, maybe with his presence still very weak after his defeat by Nancy, Freddy was using Jessie to spread new fear to the children of Elm Street so that he'd be strong enough to be able to terrorise and kill his victims in their dreams again? As it is the tone is patchy and has no real atmosphere at all.. It has its good points and moments, it gets off on the right foot with the regular bus ride turning into a trip straight to hell, with the bus precariously hanging above a flaming abyss on crumbling rocks. That a creepy memorable sequence and a high note to me and the effects are impressive, as are the ones done in the also memorable scene where Freddy bursts out of Jessie's body like out of a cocoon, it's very well done and is a little reminiscent of David's transformation into a werewolf in a certain classic! I like the few scenes in the old abandoned steelworks factory, it's a spooky old joint and it makes sense that a corporeal Freddy would return to haunt his old lair.. The silly monster animals might not seem to make sense but maybe it's Freddy's unearthly influence starting to manifest itself? One thing the movie has in its corner is that it has Clu Gulagger in it, who is hilarious as a moronically skeptical old-timey father! Mark Patton is so lame and annoying in it however, he's just a whiny male waif who's essentially filling a girl's role, I mean how could the audience possibly take him seriously after he lets loose such a cringeworthy girlish shriek after the opening nightmare? Jessie is a helpless idiot, it's the girl who saves him in the end after solving the mystery for him - it might be the only flick in the series with a male lead but it doesn't count for very much, when push comes to shove it's still a woman that beats Freddy, with a kiss nonetheless! Jessie is baptised and born anew by the power of her pure love and his inner lurking evil of corruption is banished, but it's only a matter of time before the symbolism strikes again!! As much as this film leans toward the sucky side of things it could have easily been a lot worse if the execs hadn't come to their senses and used Robert Englund in the role he was born to play a second time after a failed screen test. And for what it's worth, like Friday the 13th A New Beginning, it at least offered a novel approach to a beloved horror character and an interesting chapter in an awesome series. Not nearly as good as the original but not as bad as some make it out to be. A solid 7 out of 10 Fu Man Chew Fingers! X",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

66,Witchfinder-General-666,Freddy's Back... In A Rather Lame Sequel,4,1 April 2008,"Wes Craven's immensely popular ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" was, without doubt, a highly inventive and creepy film that every Horror fan should see. This is not the case with most of the sequels, however, and while this first sequel ""Freddy's Revenge"" is, in my opinion, not the absolute worst of the series (as some people seem to think), it is anything but memorable. Five years after the incidents from the first film, new families with kids have moved into Elm Street. One of the teenagers who are now living on elm Street is Jesse, who soon has some unpleasant dreams... about our old friend Freddy Krueger.The second film in the series is not the total disaster it is sometimes labeled to be, but it is certainly a pretty lame sequel. While there are some good elements (the famous opening sequence, occasional gore...), this entirely lacks the creepiness and atmosphere of the first. The characters are unlikable and quite hard to care about, and the film never gets really scary. Apart from Robert Englund and Hope Lange the performances are entirely forgettable. What I liked about ""Freddy's Revenge"" is that it is does not yet feature a load of 'coool' moronic gags, as it is the case with some of the later sequels. This is not completely awful, but the only people I'd recommend it to are hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiasts. All others, watch the original and the third part ""The Dream Warriors"", and skip all the others.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
67,aidanratesmovies,"Imperfect and messy, but at times quite fun",7,21 May 2020,"Decently entertaining, and at times interesting and quite scary, A Nightmare on Elm Street has more than enough flaws, but as pure entertainment value, the film has just enough to offer to make for a good time. Robert Englund reprises his role as Freddy Krueger in the sequel to the iconic role he first took place in. Englund is somehow the best actor out of the whole cast, which isn't quite saying a lot, but he proves to be the only truly enjoyable performance to watch upon screen at times. The other actors in the film are quite wooden, most notably its main leads: Mark Patton, Kim Myers, and Robert Rusler. The role of Mr. Walsh, played by Clu Gulager however, is by far the worst performance in the film, and his overacting remarks mixed with his ridiculously obvious and stupid dialogue almost make him laughably bad. There are a few things in the film that are also laughably bad, mostly resulting in a few plot points, such as a bird literally exploding or the constant homerotic undertones throughout the film. However, as flawed as the film is, it's still enjoyable to watch. It's not super entertaining, but it proves to be a decent watch more than not, and even quite a few times is able to truly handle its suspense surprisingly well. Though it seems like it has more potential than it did, various parts of the film are quite interesting, and the story itself, as muddled as it may seem at times, is in fact interesting to follow. The film may shine better with a more modern remake today, requiring some better filmmakers of course, who could truly give the film the potential inside that it so desperately wants to show, but can't manage to fully come out. In the end, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 is far from perfect, but it's an enjoyable slasher flick that sticks to the basics. It's silly at times, but can also be quite frightening, and though the acting may be wooden, it sure can be a delight to watch unfold.My Rating: 7.3/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

69,truemythmedia,One of the Worst Elm Street Sequels,4,30 October 2019,"Out of all the 80s slasher villains, I think Freddy Kruegar is by far the most creative, and his movies, even when they're not all that great, usually have a few pretty compelling dream/kill sequences, and let's be honest, when you're looking for cheap 80s slasher flicks, isn't that really all you need? This film starts off alright. There's a great opening sequence where Freddy drives a school bus out into the desert and suddenly the ground opens up and the bus is left teetering on a small pillar, with what looks to be lava down below. The special effects are just the right amount of cheesy and creepy- the essential texture of Freddy's Nightmare-worlds. I was freaking digging it! The problems really start in the third act when the movie just takes a nose dive. The rules in the first film establish that Freddy needs to be in the dreamworld to have power, but then Nancy is also able to pull Freddy out of the dreamworld into the real world, where she has the upper hand and is able to kill him by taking away his power. Cool, so far so good. In this film, the rules are stretched to say that, when the kid is asleep, he can manipulate/possess them into killing in the real world; I can still buy that. But there's a part in this film where Freddy is suddenly able to appear to an entire pool full of kids that are having a party, and without hesitating he begins massacring them. I sort of started to check out at that point, because they'd thrown all of their own rules out the window. Don't you have to be asleep to get attacked by Freddy? How is he able to manifest himself suddenly outside the dreamworld? They toss all logic and rules out the window, and suddenly I don't care anymore. For the first two acts there were some cool moments, so I don't think this film is entirely a wash, but it's also not all that good. I suppose if you like Freddy as a villain (like myself), then this has a few good Freddy moments, but unless you're a huge ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fan, you probably don't have any need to see this.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
70,vertigo_14,What the heck was I thinking as a kid?,2,21 April 2004,"When they rereleased all the Nightmare on Elm Street movies again, I was glad to get my hands on number's two, three, and four in the series. No sooner did I watch them, did I wonder what the heck I was thinking when I was a kid? Number two is the worst.I think I used to like the idea of Freddy possessing some weirdo kid. But geez, that might've been a fine tale to tell if the actors weren't such giant nerds, especially the lead, Jesse Walsh, played by Mark Patton in what has to be the most forced bit of acting I'd ever seen. And that really spoiled everything from the start, especially as he takes loud gasps between dramatic dialogue. Save maybe Robert Russler who plays Ron Grady, this movie just isn't worth the time. It is indeed the worst of the series (and there were quite a few bad ones). The story is that Mark Patton and his family move into the house where a girl was murdered. Mark, and his annoying girlfriend Lisa Webber (Kim Meyers), know this because they find her diary hidden somewhere in his room. But what's this? Living in the house and reading the diary unlocks the story of Freddy ""Mr. Invincibility"" Krueger. And soon, Mark starts to become Freddy as the guy has possessed his body, and forces Mark to carry out his dirty deeds. Like Freddy used to say, ""You are all my children now."" Too bad Mark is such a little girl when it comes to misbehaving. There's no point in going on, the movie is just stupid. Actually, if you're looking to watch the series, I'd recommend Nightmare on Elm Street 3: probably the best in the series, and the one with arguably the best special effects.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
71,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Another horror franchise sequel that is just average to its first,5,18 January 2015,"It's truly sad to see when a promising franchise starter manages to shoot itself in the foot after its first sequel. Of course for Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), was not the only movie franchise in general to achieve mainstream popularity and have a sequel made right after it. Like many others, whether it be ""Part 2"" or just labeled with the number 2 after it, its successor ended up financially blowing away its competition but lost its critical flare that the original had. The reason behind these flaws was either the lack of the creator's involvement with the further projects or the producers decided otherwise what should be the next step in the franchise. As of right now, there's only one horror sequel that manages to complete its narrative in two successful steps and that's John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981).Here fans are introduced to Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), the newest tenant living in 1428 Elm Street, the same house that Krueger appeared in 1984. After a few nights of some intense dreams involving Krueger (Robert Englund) wanting Jesse to kill for him, his friends Lisa Webber (Kim Myers) and Ron Grady (Robert Rusler) begin to notice and try to figure out what's going on. The sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) doesn't make sense in a number of areas. As his first writing job, David Chaskin didn't modify the script in any way to enhance the story that was told prior. His first mistake is the title; Freddy's Revenge? Who is Krueger getting revenge on? He got his revenge at the end of the first entry. This also completely puts into question what are Freddy's motivations. Why does Freddy want Jesse to kill for him? If its to avoid having people think Freddy Krueger is back, the reason seems pointless. Nobody believes what they don't see anyway. Jack Sholder's direction in the plot is interesting but if looked at deeper, it just doesn't add up. The only thing Chaskin does correctly is continuing to maintain connections to the first nightmare by introducing Nancy's diary, which gives the characters a sparknotes edition of the events before. Although even that may come into question because I don't clearly remember Nancy ever writing down anything about her experiences. The main actors do give believable performances for the situations they encounter but unfortunately, they aren't attachable. Mark Patton and his co-stars can portray emotion but they just aren't the same likable cast. The only actor who comes out unscathed is Robert Englund just because he's playing Krueger like he always has. The only difference here is that he no longer has a connection to these specific characters other than one of the individuals living in 1428 Elm Street.Even actor Marshall Bell has a minor role but for those who are familiar with Bell's other roles, they might already know where he's headed. The cinematography provided by Jacques Haitkin (who worked on the first nightmare) and Christopher Tufty manage to keep the look of the first with various lighting and colors. However, the creativity behind the dream sequences isn't as frequent anymore either. And when the scene shifts to a dream, the scenes focus more on the surroundings than what Krueger can do. Instead, the big thing going for when Krueger is around is that everything gets molten hot. That's nice because in some cases it did look good for the practical and special effects used. However more could have been done too. A good example of this is one dream sequence that is skin crawling. For a minute I actually thought it was real.This leads to the horror aspect of the picture. Is it scary? Well, for horror fans no but they should still have fun watching it. As for anyone else who's not used to Krueger already, they will be scared. The makeup on Krueger is still slimy and gross and his method of killing is still grotesque and ugly. Can you imagine being killed by rusty claws? Ewww,...at least clean them. The music produced by horror composer Christopher Young is an unfortunate let down too. Young who would later prove himself with Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) score, manages to only make the score to this sequel only creepy and not scare inducing. For some reason, Young also did not include composer Charles Bernstein's original theme from the first movie and its sad because Young probably could have enhanced such a unforgettable cue. Here Young does include drawn out clashing string tunes and one-two mystery notes. That's it and regrettably, this is Young's only score to this franchise. Sigh.The special/practical effects still look good and the story's direction is new but with little to no clarity, the reasoning barely makes sense. Although every actor is new other than Robert Englund, none of them give showings that are remotely memorable. Grievously, even with Christopher Young composing the musical score, he too cannot help the film be but only mediocre.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
72,alexanderdavies-99382,Nowhere as good as the original but still effective.,7,7 September 2017,"""A Nightmare On Elm Street: Freddy's Revenge"" is a pretty good sequel in all fairness. Robert Englund was back as Freddy Kruegar and his character was still being treated pretty seriously. It is true that the leading man can't actually his way out of a rubber johnny, let alone a paper bag. He has no talent at all and I can't imagine why he was even given the opportunity to be in this film. The same applies to the leading lady, she is simply hopeless. Neither one of them displays any of the vulnerability that the cast from before showed. I can't understand why there was that scene at the gay bar. OK, the high school coach is attracted to men but how is that relevant to the story of the film? Robert Englund is the reason to see this and the pace is fast-moving which helps. The opening scene on the school bus is both imaginative and atmospheric. I enjoy the scene where Freddy appears at the teenagers barbecue and reeks havoc. The kids try to cower away from him but it's all in vain. I can't believe I was cheering when I saw him! The moment when Jesse and Lisa discover the diary of Nancy Thompson is a telling one. It reveals the danger Jesse is in for the first time. As in the previous film, Robert Englund doesn't have much screen time but he comes into the film when required. Some fans are a bit divided over whether the idea of Kruegar existing inside Jesse was a good move. I'm not sure. It seems slightly far fetched but in Freddy Kruegar's world, everything is! For the first time, we get to see Freddy's domain - which is the old factory on the outskirts of Springfield. The previous film only showed the factory in bits and pieces, it consisted of small camera shots here and there. In ""Freddy's Revenge,"" we see a real factory being used for the plot and it looks a great set. A worthy sequel.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
73,alexanderdavies-99382,Less effective but still good.,7,23 December 2017,"Sequels usually have a hard time in hoping to be as good as the original and the above film is no exception.
 With this second Freddy Kruegar movie, the setting has advanced by a few years after the events of the previous film. The Thompson residence is occupied once more (for the last time) by a new family who are completely unaware of the house's troubled history - shame on the estate agents! It's no wonder the family bought the property at a knockdown price.
 As the main character who begins experiencing various incidents courtesy of Freddy, Mark Patton is 100% wooden. How in God's name he came to be cast is anyone's guess. Thank goodness Robert Englund is on hand as the one of the most iconic horror cinema characters of all time. I like the fact that Freddy was still being written as that of being serious and not like the overly jokey person he became later on. As before, Englund doesn't have loads of dialogue but he makes his lines matter every time. His appearances are well timed.
 I enjoyed the scenes where Jesse and Lisa discover the diary of Nancy Thompson and thus, begin to investigate the history of the Thompson house and also about Freddy. The scene involving the massacre of all those annoying teenagers during their outside party is a true highlight as Freddy is relentless in his intense dislike of them (can't really blame him).
 For the first time, a location was found and used for Freddy's boiler room and it works very well. It is a vast area and looks as though it had been genuinely abandoned.
 Some parts of the story don't make much sense at times but I can over look this. The suggestion of homosexuality is rather obvious and none too subtle. It has been suggested in the ensuing years that Jesse is secretly gay and that he enjoyed the advances of the local high school sports coach at that gay nightclub. Who knows?
 As with every Freddy Kruegar film, it is somewhat difficult to outsmart the killer with the razor glove. Sure enough, he really pulls the rug from under the feet of the main characters! The final scene bears witness to this.
The direction is pretty good but not as effective as that of Wes Craven by a long way.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
74,Sandcooler,There will always be Freddie,5,16 January 2006,"It's just hard to make a sequel as good as the original, simply because all the good ideas are used in the first one. That's pretty clear in this pretty uninspired sequel. Nancy is nowhere to be seen in this movie, because apparently she's in an asylum. Which is fancy movie talk for the actress lost interest. The main guy apparently made everyone's gaydars go of, yeah I guess I see it. The plot develops in a pretty boring direction, minor characters start piling up. There's one scene I could actually call good and it involves Freddie crashing a pool party, causing mayhem, attacking stuntmen. The ending however is simply unforgivable. That really just wasn't very cool, it looks like they were out of money mid-production. But the redeeming factor in this movie is that at least they kept the atmosphere of the first one. It's still horror without trying to be anything else. Also, as long as a movie has Freddie it's still somewhat watchable, even though this screenplay blows.

75,gangstahippie,underrated but one of the worse ones,8,2 August 2007,"Rated R for Violence/Gore,Language and Some Nudity.The first Nightmare On Elm Street is one of my favorite horror movies.It had an original plot and was very entertaining.Now this is the first of the many sequels that followed it.Sure its not as good as the first and its the second worst one in the series(in my opinion).But its still an entertaining and good 1980's slasher flick.The cast is different from the first film and neither of the actors or actresses from this film return for any of the sequels.In this film, a family moves into the house that Nancy lived in during the first film.Freddy possesses the teenager who lives in the house and makes him do his killings for him.With the help of his girlfriend, he must stop Freddy.Though the sequels are known for their comedy, this film wasn't meant to be a comedy.Yet there are a few laugh out loud scenes in it.Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is an alright sequel that slasher film fans should enjoy.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The story unfolds five years later, as Jesse Walsh, a new teen in town, moves into the house that previously belonged to Nancy. Jesse remains blissfully unaware of the supernatural presence haunting the house -- until Freddy starts invading his dreams. The undead creature wants to take over Jesse's body and renew his murderous vendetta against the local kids. In a last, anguished attempt to save his own and his friends' lives, Jesse gathers his pals together to fight Freddy off and destroy him, once and for all.ANOES 2 is one of those films that COULD have been good but was effed up in the writing stages of pre-production. This film is BAD and I stress the word ""bad."" This sequel to the franchise seems to be the one that connects with the franchise the least because everything is so very different and seem to completely ignore what happened in the first film with the exception of Freddy Krueger.However, the best part of the film is the first scene, and that's a bad sign. It's a nightmare sequence involving our protagonist in a bus with two other students. It turns out Freddy is driving the bus and all hell breaks loose. I won't spoil what happens in this nightmare sequence because it is done so well and it's one of the best nightmare sequences in the entire franchise. For a film that starts off so well, one wonders how it quickly goes downhill.This is the only film in which Freddy possesses a teenager in order to kill other teenagers. Now, this may sound good because it's actually different, but it's done so badly. There's also a sense of homo-eroticism running throughout the entire film, most of it having to do with our main protagonist being half naked almost in mostly the entire film. There is also a scene that takes place in a locker room where a male character is stripped naked and slapped in the butt cheeks with a towel. I don't know. You make up your own mind.Mark Patton is our new protagonist and he does, I'll admit, a decent job. I seriously don't remember much from the other characters except Robert Englund, but that's basically a given. ANOES 2 disappoints because it had so much potential given from the first scene and movie. Skip this or just watch the first scene of the film. ANOES 2 is the worst in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
77,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Freddy's Revenge""- A misunderstood and surprisingly enjoyable sequel thanks to its interesting themes. Unfortunately it just doesn't quite come together particularly well.",6,19 October 2016,"In the world of horror, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge"" has become something of a joke in recent years. Being degenerated to the status of little more than an internet meme because of its flaws and... well, because of it's ""unique"" themes and ideas. It was a sequel that never quite struck a chord with audiences in the same way that other entries of the series were able to, and sits as one of the black sheep of the entire franchise.We follow Jesse (Mark Patton), who is plagued with nightmares about the burned murderer Freddy (Robert Englund) after moving into the former home of original hero Nancy Thompson. As the nights wear on, it becomes clear that Freddy is trying to infiltrate Jesse's body, to use as a conduit to be able to terrorize the real world once again, outside of the dreams in which he's trapped. And so, with the help of his friend Grady (Robert Rusler) and love interest Lisa (Kim Myers), Jesse must make a desperate stand against this dark master of dreams in order to survive...A big part of the fascination and infamy of this particular follow- up is the not-so-subtle ways in which it seems to try and imply that the lead character Jesse may be a closeted homosexual man, or if nothing else is just very repressed. It's actually a really fun idea for a horror film such as this, and it has the potential to add great depth. Slasher movies typically focus on teens and young adults, who are of course in a very turbulent and developmental part of their life. Exploring this from the perspective of someone who may not necessarily be comfortable with their identity or may even be actively trying to hide it (aka, being closeted) adds a lot of empathy and an inherent sympathy for the character. We can feel for them because we all have aspects of ourselves we fear that others won't accept due to societal, religious or other reasons.The problem here is that the film's approach is extremely blatant, yet also uneven and unsure of itself. And it lends to a lot of tragically unintentional laughs. The film seems obsessed with piling this idea onto the narrative almost constantly in a bizarrely over-the-top fashion (this was back in the 80's when writers hadn't quite figured out how to write positive, realistic gay characters)... so there's comical dancing scenes, board games with obvious titles such as ""probe"" on display in Jesse's closet (subtle...), and an uncomfortably prolonged scene where Jesse ends up in a BDSM nightclub and is found out by his gym-teacher... dressed in full-on gimp-gear. Yet the film also seems frightened to fully explore this idea, and thus it constantly saddles Jesse with a generic female love interest every so often. It's like they wanted to make a strong character study about a gay man under the guise of a horror film... but then chickened out because they knew the bigoted high school jocks who came to see the film wouldn't accept it.Still, despite wimping out of it's central theme of discovering and embracing oneself, the film is most certainly not a total loss. In fact, it's a halfway decent sequel and I find it very misunderstood by many people who simply like to point and laugh at it for its unique attempts at subtext. While the film is pretty on-the-nose with its symbology, it still does add an interesting layer to the storyline and it's nice to at least see an attempt to explore such themes. Especially at a time when the world wasn't quite as liberal and accepting as it is now. The performances are also fantastic. Patton makes for a very likable lead character and you can't help but root for him. Myers is also a great co-star despite being saddled with the role of ""generic love interest."" And Rusler also stands out quite a bit. And of course, Robert Englund simply IS Freddy. He's disturbing and hilarious. Demented and amusing. All the right things that help bring the character to life. This is also Freddy at arguably his darkest, and it's fun to watch, especially in comparison to later entries that ""lightened up"" the character gradually.As it stands, I do view ""Freddy's Revenge"" as a slightly above- average 80's slasher sequel. It's unique attempts at exploring character add some interesting moments despite becoming laughable at times. And it's always a joy to see Freddy's creative kills and the wild and crazy effects the filmmakers can come up with. I actually wouldn't mind seeing this sort-of story revisited in a future film, and allowed to be fully fleshed out. I think it would actually work darned well.I'm giving it a slightly above average 6 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Starring Mark Patton, Kim Myers, Robert Englund, Robert Rusler, Clu Gulager, Hope Lange, Marshall Bell, Sydney Walsh, Christie Clark. (R)After moving into the same bedroom once occupied by Nancy Thompson (from the original), teenager Patton starts getting visited by Freddy Krueger (Englund) while he sleeps. Sequel to the surprise horror hit ignores the initial conceit (Freddy stalking and killing youths in their dreams) and instead has the maniac try to possess one so that the kid can do the dirty work for him in the real world. Funny far more often than frightening, be it a murderous pet parakeet, supernatural towels spanking locker room heinies, Freddy crashing a pool party, or Patton's girlish screams; overall, a rather tepid outing even for the fanbase. Englund is still in fine form, but the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable (aside from Myers looking an awful lot like a young Meryl Streep, and Patton resembling Gary Numan in the opening bus ride sequence). Since no character besides Freddy appears in any other ""Elm Street"" film, the only interest here for non-completists is its oft-discussed closeted gay subtext, which the filmmakers long-denied, yet what ended up in the final print can't be mistaken.41/100",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Freddy now seems to be able to interfere with others through the power of dreams, not the just the person that has the dreams, and it comes across as contrived and tacky.Freddy is still a good character, although more laughable than Scary in this outing, he was humorous in the first movie, but not at the expense of the Horror.Don't let this movie be your guide, The original Nightmare wipes the floor with this second rate follow up.4/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Before he knows it our favorite charasmatic villain starts haunting him in hopes of possessing him so he can be reborn into the real world. The film is flooded with the queer goods but in addition to all that it's actually a really unique genre film. Robert Englund is truly fantastic as Freddy he's darker, sexual, perverted and disturbing. The performances are pretty solid all around. Also impressive is Kim Myers as Tina our final girl next to our final boy. She's vulnerable, relatable and strong. Although the director still denies his homoerotic intentions.

The power plant looked really creepy and those dogs with the face of a child at the entrance was super bizarre.

83,baumer,An abomination,4,14 November 2000,"To understand how bad this film is, one has to only look at the other two famous ""killer"" movies from the 70's and 80's.  First came Halloween in 1978.  Then Halloween 2 comes out three years later.  Halloween, like Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the best horror films ever made.  It was tense, horrific and superbly directed.  Halloween 2 was almost as good. The story was actually furthered perfectly as it took place the very same night right after Loomis shoots Michael off the balcony.Then there was Friday the 13th.  I personally thought that part one was a decent start to the series, but it was the weakest of the first four. Nonetheless, it started the series and when Cunningham passed the reigns over to Steve Miner, to me it got better.  I am not saying that Friday the 13th is anywhere near as good as Halloween or Nightmare On Elm Street, but it certainly is quite well done, which is proved by it's longevity.  Part 2 took a natural progression into the story and introduced Jason Voorhees, ruthless killer, to the film world.  He follows in his mothers footsteps and seeks vengeance for her death.  Makes sense to me.Now, part two of the Nightmare series is not even of the same mind.  There is not a modicum of similarities between this one and Wes Craven's original. Fred Krueger was a sinister, dark, evil character.  When he tried to be funny, he did it so that he could taunt his victims.  When he laughed, you felt chills.  When he told you that his finger knives were God, you somehow believed him.  He was the epitome of evil.  Craven and Robert Shaye did it right in the first one.  In this abomination of a follow up, Fred Krueger is more like a stand-up comedian.  He would rather tell jokes that scare his victims and his audience.  He would rather make us laugh than make the hair on our skin stand up.  And you know what?  That p***es me off.  Perhaps it shouldn't, after all it is only a movie.  But it does.  Why would you mess with success?  Why would you take all that is holy and turn it into a circus?  I guess you can say that the formula worked because the franchise has been awfully good to New Line and Robert Shaye, but that is of no comfort to me.You see, I love to be scared.  I love it when that special film comes along and actually freaks me out.  There are so few films that can do it and Nightmare On Elm Street did to me.  Then it suckered me into the theater back in 1985 and it played a joke on me.  I saw every Nightmare that was released hoping that it would somehow get better.  But they didn't.  Every one of them were bad except for Wes Craven's New Nightmare.  Craven wanted nothing to do with this garbage because he knew that it was a sellout.Perhaps I am a bit of a hypocrite for lambasting this film because I am usually one that understands the bottom line in Hollywood is to make money. Films like Armageddon and True Lies and The Perfect Storm are there to turn a profit.  And they do so by following a certain formula that will almost guarantee then success.  Perhaps Robert Shaye thought that to make a franchise of a character he had to give him more of a personality.  So they made Krueger Jerry Lewis.  But my anger stems from the fact that there are so few films that truly frighten me.  I love horror films but to do it right is a work of art.  Halloween, Evil Dead, Blair Witch Project, Jaws and Nightmare On Elm Street are films that get inside of you.  They twist you and manipulate you.  This one just manipulated my wallet for a few bucks. That's it.  And that is sad.0 out of 10-  Everyone behind this film should be ashamed of themselves.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
84,DunnDeeDaGreat,Crappy sequel to a great film,4,15 April 2002,A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is a crappy sequel to a great horror movie. The film does have some scary moments but overall it sucks ass.

85,mentalcritic,At least it had the guts to be a bit different...,5,23 April 2003,"Now that Nightmare is up to seven or eight sequels, while Friday The 13th is up to ten (and counting), it must be hard to look back on the days when horror films tried to be vaguely original or even different. With all the Screams and I Know What Your Breasts Did Last Summers, making Freddy's Revenge in these ""enlightened"" days would be just about impossible.But culture, and particularly youth culture, in the 1980s was considerably different, certainly far less conservative and anti-creative. In those days, The Cure were a big thing, and even the most basic of pop sludge was far more creative than what we have today. Not to mention that it was far easier to make dodgy films and get them released theatrically.A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2 picks up five years after the original, although it was a rush-job filmed less than a year after said original was out of the theatre. The film company, at that time the independent startup known as New Line, saw a quick and easy meal ticket that only required them to convince Robert Englund to submerge himself in what looks like three tons of multi-coloured latex. So the idea of a decent script, decent actors, or decent photography, went right out the window.Which is kind of sad, really, when you consider that this is the only Freddy film in which an original premise is used. You might want to skip the rest of this paragraph if you have yet to see it. In it, a young man (whose behaviour is consistent with repressed homosexuality, in one of those hilarious plot coincidences) has just moved into the house from which Nancy originally dealt with Freddy. With the help of the sort of girlfriend any other male (and even some females) of this age would want to climb atop of at every opportunity, our hero attempts to fight off Freddy (and his own gayness), which in turn creates some very interesting plot devices. The moment when our heroine is holding up a carving knife at Freddy, who gives her a graphic and terrifying demonstration of the fact that she'll kill her (confused) lover if she kills Freddy, could have been one of the most horrific moments in the entire series. I am not quite convinced that it isn't, given that the only other episode in the series that was vaugely adult after this point was Part 3.Unfortunately, the actors hired for these roles cannot act their way out of a wet paper bag. The only cast member with acting skills that even compare to Robert Englund's would be Marshall Bell. I am convinced that his turn here as the (gay) gym teacher was what got him hired to be in Total Recall and StarShip Troopers. Mark Patton (no relation to the Mike Patton who leads Mr. Bungle or the Mike Patton who was an early cast member in You Can't Do That On Television) is terrible - his only talent, as such, is to scream like a seventy-year-old woman. The actors who play his family look as if they belong on a cheap knock-off of Family Ties. The best actor in the whole piece was the budgie, who seemed to decide he would rather explode than be in this idiotic film a second longer.When all is said and done, Robert Louis Stevenson said it much better in The Frightening Tale Of Doctor Jekyll And Mister Hyde (although there are no shortage of adaptations to that work which suck more than this). Normally, I would give this effort a three out of ten, but it gets two bonus points because it is like no other episode in the Nightmare canon, and that is a damned good thing when you put it alongside episodes four through seven.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
86,mattymatt4ever,Amusing sequel,7,3 March 2003,"I didn't pay much attention to the film's flaws while watching it, being that I just wanted to be entertained.  And the film is entertaining.  But there was something about it that I found a little confusing.  And after I watched the behind-the-scenes interviews on the DVD, it became more clear to me.  In this one, Freddy was not just haunting the main character, but everyone around him.  In the first ""Nightmare"" Freddy basically haunted those who he invaded in their dreams.  In the sequel, Freddy's crashing a pool party, trying to kill everyone in sight.  It was mentioned in the interviews that Freddy was actually brought out of the dream state and into the real world.  That's what perplexed me, because I found it a little implausible for him to be terrorizing so many people in the main character's dreams.  And I really wish I didn't hear that this was regarded as the most homo-erotic horror film in a gay magazine.  The director mentioned that the main character/actor had a certain feminine quality to him, and there are homosexual overtones throughout the film.  I didn't catch onto them while viewing the film, but those ideas are now implanted in my head for when I watch it again.  Thanks a lot!

Apart from a solid opening act and one tense scene (involving some great special effects) this film truly is a stinker. The main character is a total bore (I actually wanted him to be killed gruesome ways), the film is virtually suspenseless, it's horribly written dialouge-wise and I don't think Jack Shoulder is a very competent director. In fact, every character is either boring or horribly acted and the shock ending, while being utterly predictable, fails to inject any life into an overall thoroughly rotten movie.The worst in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Sometimes she could not show fear.They said that Nancy Thompson went to a mental institution, so she is not dead. Her father also saw freddy. So, as an adult an cop, he could do something. I expected father to reveal things but probably he chose to escape with nancy.Movie name is revenge but what is the revenge here :) I think freddy was brought to real world in first movie by nancy, so he is revenging it here. But not from nancy, maybe not yet.I could not understand why he needed jesse to kill. In first movie he could kill easily with dreams. Because he is in real world? (that was my theory). Maybe yes.Anyways, he used jesse's body to attack and kill. I could not understand how he could kill for example the coach while jesse's body was in his room. Maybe freddy only needs body who can dream. He kills in his way again. I am not sure.While between teenagers, he was cool. It was good scene. He said ""you are all my children now"" and did not kill rest of them. It was also interesting. Maybe lisa saved again somehow or freddy took control of them.Lisa was brave in the end to go to the old place where freddy was working, just like in the first movie how nancy was brave. And with ""power of love"", she took back jesse. But just like first movie, it was all hallucination maybe or they could not remove freddy totally. So maybe revenge was that in the end. Freddy took friend of lisa and it was revenge maybe.This time movie was directed by Jack Sholder, not wes craven.And about those years. Kid was in a bus with radio. Interesting scenes.And first scene. The bus was going in such nice areas without any greens. I liked those scenes.Seeing college life was cool also. Some kids were doing archery, some were playing baseball.There was no internet or something so they bought house and did not know about it, its history.In birds scene, first one was killed. I hope it was not real bird. And they probably made scared other bird. It exploded then. I hope they were not hurt. That is why i will give 6/10.

91,ivo-cobra8,"A bad sequel, but an OK movie in the slasher horror genre!",7,1 November 2015,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985), oh boy. It is not the worst movie in the series but is not the greatest sequel either. It is very Underrated which I understand why because the film has a lot of problems. It is my at least favorite film. Even tough it is a bad sequel it still follows the roots from first movie with a different story, different idea,different cast and that is good. The first time that a boy was a main hero in A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. In the rest of the sequels was always some girl as a hero. 4,5,6 and the remake (2010) are seriously the worst ones in the movies, the best one is Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Freddy was still serious - not as much joking around and you feel for the main character - plus his girlfriend was smoking hot - didn't know he was bisexual. What can I say? I don't hate the film and I like it for a bit but that's it. I like the film because it follows the roots from the first film, It is mentioning Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) yes I am a Nancy Thompson fan! I love her very much and this film has respect to Nancy Thompson! While showing the diary and the telling the story's about her. Walsh family moved in to Thompson's house. That's what I like a bit this film. It is a horror film, Freddy kills a doesn't people, specially in the pool that was just awesome. Kim Myers as Lisa Webber was really smoking hot and she cared about Jesse. I like this film for it. Freddy stripped the coach down and killed him in that gay overtone because the coach was into some freaky sexual stuff, because I remember the coach being in leather and bondage looking clothes when he runs into Jesse.. So yeah Freddy killed him in an extreme version of what the coach liked. From the looks of the coach's bondage like clothes he had on you can assume he likes to be whipped and stuff like that. So his death scene was very fitting and that was awesome, I like that a lot. The love scene between Jesse and Lisa conger and defeating Freddy was amazing! The nightmare on the bus was just really extremely awesome even the ending scene was awesome. The film has major problems that I just don't like that. For most of the movie Freddy's Glove was missing and they had to use the blades on his fingers. Reportedly it was stolen after filming and they had to scramble to make a replacement. They should have watch for that glove. Wes Craven refused to work on this film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. I agree with that, why the main hero has to get him self into been manipulated and go murdering people around? That's just not right and it is wrong in my opinion. The film was too short and it become a little boring by time to time. I didn't like the gay scenes including the couch who was a molester and a gay in this film. I am glad Freddy killed him. The story had potential, but it just failed. The part where Jesse runs into gym teacher at the s&m bar and then he brings him back to the school and has him do laps and makes him take a shower, after he was tired. Looks like he was prepping Jessie for ass rape. That was the worst gay scene in the movie ever and it hurt the film so much! Anyway with all the problems in the movie, the story did work well. Freddy in this film is at his darkest plus the make up FX by Kevin Yagher on Freddy made him look more and scary then I ever seen him look in any of the films after this one. It had a very good cast and effects and you finally saw Freddy's whole face it was a nice sequel. I think Jack Sholder did a great direction debut I don't think, he did a terrible job which he didn't. Robert Englund did a great job in this film, that is one of the reason the film isn't the worst than other sequels are. It is at least my favorite horror slasher film because it really did had a potential and it failed. It was OK sequel tough, but still a bad one and I have a lot of respect for Mark Patton cheers for him!!!

Naturally, the colossal success of the first one (by its parameters) sparked the interest of producer Robert Shaye, founder and then owner of New Line, in continuing to make movies with Freddy. It is also reported that it was the success of this second film - which, with a budget of $3 million, returned to the studio $30 million in the US alone - that spurred and established the small production company amidst the giants of the movie mecca. Today, New Line was purchased and is a subsidiary of Warner Bros.In Nightmare Hour 2, young Jesse (played by Mark Patton) moves with his family to the home where Nancy (the protagonist of the first film, who left Elm Street after the tragedy five years earlier) lived. Jesse becomes tormented in his nightmares by Freddy Krueger and discovers, upon finding Nancy's diary, that the house has a dark past of violence and madness. Some unexplained events, such as a toaster that catches fire even when it is unplugged and a canary that literally explodes in the air, as well as an infernal heat intrigue the family, who insist in not believing that something could be really haunting the place. But for Jesse the nightmares become more and more intense and Freddy is getting closer and closer to possessing him.The screenplay, written by newcomer David Chaskin, misses ugly as it distorts the villain's original concept: Freddy now doesn't just want to sneak into his victims' dreams and torture them; the villain wants to take over the protagonist's body and, from it, commit murders in the real world. What makes the script even more confusing is the fact that the killer is not identified at any time: was Jesse possessed or Freddy himself ""materialized"" in our reality? And what would your real goal be? In one of the film's most embarrassing moments, Freddy attacks several young people who are at a party - everyone sees him, including the adults. But even worse is when the guy screams at the surviving teenagers that they are all his children and a big flame tries to attract the viewer's attention and connect Freddy with hell. They could have done it in a more creative way. It is good to remember that the great idea of the character created by Wes Craven was always another type of confusion, much more sophisticated, in which we do not know where the nightmare begins and where it ends; besides the character being seen only by the victims whose dream was invaded.Immediately, it is an admirable idea in that it is not limited to a mere repetition of the original formula. It is even bold that Chaskin's script bets on very little presence of Krueger, focusing mainly on the promising mental game between Jesse and the dream killer and shocking images, like the teenager suddenly realizing the glove of claws in his own hand or the Freddy's head trying to pop out of his stomach. Promising ideas, but which are wasted on one of the looser and lackluster scripts. By the way, Chaskin himself admitted that he did the entire text to suggest a homosexual subtext, something that would be interesting and unheard of in the genre if worked out well, but which ends up sounding laughable when we have dialogues like ""There's a man trying to get out of me! "" or a nightmare sequence that involves Freddy torturing a gym teacher by hitting towels on his bare bottom... In a sauna... Right after a chase at an S&M club. Yeah, this really is classified as a horror movie. It's no surprise that Wes Craven didn't want any involvement with the project.In this second film, the dark humor is accentuated and the sarcastic tone that would become characteristic of the character's lines begins to take shape. At one point, Freddy tries to explain didactically to Jesse why he will possess his body: ""You have the body and I have the brain! ""At the same time it rips the deformed skin off your head, leaving your brain exposed. As for the cast, none of the characters is captivating like Nancy from the first movie, and even though Jesse brings the necessary clichés to a horror character that breeds empathy, Mark Patton's performance is forced and downright irritating, as if no one is there - not even Patton or the director - take something there seriously. There's not much to say about the rest of the cast, unless Robert Englund is evilly fun as in the original and Kim Meyers is eerily reminiscent of a young Meryl Streep. Only in appearance, of course.It is also incomprehensible why the great soundtrack created for the original (composed by Charles Bernstein and used in all the other films in the franchise) was forgotten in this sequel. Also in relation to the script, a positive point is the evolution of the mythology that involves the character and the perfect link with the first film (a hook that rests on Nancy's diary). It is also clarified that the killer Freddy, when alive, worked in a plant, where he took the children he kidnapped and murdered. When Jesse finds Freddy's glove in the basement, inside the old heater, we are led to understand that the house was once a murderer's home.But the main merit (if we can use that term) is the great special effects and makeup of newcomer Kevin Yagher - in the future Yagher would be known for creating the Chuck puppet from Child's Play and the skull host of the Tales from the Crypt series, besides having worked on sequels 3 and 4 of A Nightmare on Elm Street and directed Hellraiser 4. Some other scenes deserve to be highlighted, such as Jesse's girlfriend's saving kiss on Freddy and the outcome, when the protagonist comes out of the villain, whose charred skin is breaking into pieces.The director Jack Sholder also fails to understand the figure of Freddy and his immense potential. There isn't a single sequence capable of causing suspense or at least visual dynamism (with the exception of the opening on a school bus, but the fact that the best scene is in the opening seconds is worrisome), leaving the shine to the makeup and special effects department, who once again explore the gore caused by the murderer well. It lacked the dreamlike atmosphere and thriller of the first feature film directed by Craven, the explicit and uncomfortable violence, as well as a more elaborate direction; Jack Sholder's work (Night of Panic and The Hidden) is lazy and without style. Not knowing how to harness the good ideas and gigantic potential of its glorious monster, Freddy's Revenge is a disappointing and forgettable sequel, remembered only for its mediocrity. Fortunately, Wes Craven was watching from afar, and things would go better in the next chapter.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
93,Falconeer,"Weird, Creepy Film...",7,17 October 2019,"This has got to be the strangest horror sequel of all time, next to ""Exorcist II: The Heretic,"" which was another brave risk that failed commercially due to it's weirdness and different tone. But the terms ""weird and creepy"" are not really an insult when describing a horror film. Those dark, sexual overtones in this movie lent it a haunting and sinister feel, and a truly nightmarish tone. I don't think audiences in 1985 were ready for something like this, but no matter; the reason to see this film is for the appearance of Robert Englund as the burnt child killer, Fred Kruger, and before this character was made into a joke in later films, this guy had to be the most horrifying monster of all time. And he is intensely scary in this film, which succeeds in preserving the dark tone of the original. Something the first two films managed to succeed in doing, was making scenes filmed in the bright sunlight, seem as scary and menacing as the night scenes with all the fog and shadows. Of course that locker room scene with the pervy coach was filmed at night, and I found that to be extremely unsettling, and like nothing else I had seen in other movies of the genre. Another good thing about this sequel is how it looks like the first film, with it's sets and lighting and camera work. That is the connection that it needed to connect to the first one, and the inclusion of Nancy's diary was a great way to bring her character into the new movie. The four friends in the sequel brought to mind the dynamics of the original, with the four friends dealing with the menace of Fred Kruger. I also thought the idea of Kruger possessing the body of the main character in order to be able to kill in the real world, was pretty intense. This one is different, and will not please some of the Elm Street fanbase, but the fact that Fred Kruger has never been more creepy and terrifying than in THIS movie, should make it a major selling point for ""Freddy's Revenge...""",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

I understand that fans hated it, but to me, I don't think it's as bad as everyone says it is. OK, it's not as compelling as the first, but it's a decent sequel.There are some problems that I do have. The story is thinly plotted and is not as solid as the original's story. The writing is terrible and it's not as scary as the first due to it's cheap frightening attempts.Aside from those flaws, there are some good stuff. The acting's not that bad and the make-up on Freddy is good. The scenery is great; the direction is fine and creates a suspenseful tension in it's moments; the death scenes are creative and the music score is decent with an atmospheric tone to it.Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is a decent, if not a disappointing sequel to a classic that has a thin story and terrible writing, but it has it's atmospheric moments and a lot of creative stuff. I recommend this to those who haven't seen it, but due to what I've said before, fans might want to stick to the original and some of the sequels.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

This is the 1st of many sequels. No need of watching more than this, seriously.The original might be a frightening start, but obviously this one goes farther. It has more blood, brutal violence and a cup of gross scenes that the original doesn't have. Freddy Krueger is back! And he's ready for more...Freddy Krueger's repulsive figure is better seen in this film. But his characteristic laughter remains the same.Freddy Krueger seems to be immortal. He just never dies! And why's that? To give continuity to many more of these films? Give me a break! Enough is enough!Despite the fact that this was directed by another person and contains a different cast (except for the guy who plays the evil Freddy Krueger), surprisingly it isn't very inferior to the original.

The only reason's to watch this movie are for some carnage and because of Robert Englund's gleeful performance. If there is one constant that has always been strong in this series, it has been Robert Englund. The rest of the cast is basic horror movie fodder. There is a very creepy dream sequence at the beginning that plays into the fear of where that yellow bus really takes you and a real fun pool party, nightmare style. There could have been a really good movie about how a person transforms in high school.

Black sheep of the franchise, with it being the only film in which the male is the protagonist and also to have no recurring characters aside from Freddy. Typical inferior horror sequel, but it does make attempts at honoring its predecessor. Its low points are a scene with Freddy possessing a pair of lovebirds; and another scene where Myers is inexplicably right on her hunches, trying to convince Patton that it wasn't him who committed a murder when he admits to it, but also that he made his confession to her with his hands soaked in blood! Rusler is slightly more appealing as the bully-turned-friend; unfortunately, he's not explored enough and ultimately comes across as a contradictory character. Concept may have actually worked had they given it another year or two to fill the bumps in the script.★★ (out of four)",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
98,acidburn-10,Underrated Follow Up,7,10 January 2012,"The plot = Five years after the events of the first movie, a new family moves into Nancy's old house, Jesse (Mark Patton) the new teen star in this movie starts to have nightmares but this time Freddy wants something else other than killing him, he wants to take over his body and be let out into the real world.Wow the 1980's was definitely the era of the franchises, ""Halloween"" and ""Friday The 13th"" were by this time already several entries into their franchises and along comes Freddy Kruger. Rare is it in someone's lifetime that a horror character is created that has such a profound and lasting impact on the genre. It certainly isn't likely to happen again in my lifetime.I have reviewed this movie before and gave it a 5, but after a while now I have warmed more towards it, okay it's not as great as the first one, but this is still a great Freddy movie. What I liked about this entry is that we get to see a whole lot more of FreddyWhile that is usually a recipe for disaster when it comes to sequels, the tone of Nightmare 2 is perfect. Freddy is still scary this time out, it's just that he's not overexposed as he was in the films that followed. We see him just enough to appreciate his menacing appearance and presence, but not enough to become bored. I know a lot has been said about the gay undertones of this movie (like the scene where Jesse is sleepwalking and walks into a S&M bar, and when he starts kissing his girlfriend he runs away and sleep over his best friend's house) but I found it a hoot and a half with some rather interesting and funny dialogue.The performances really balance this movie out well, Mark Patton (Jesse) really handles himself well and hits all the right emotional notes. Kim Meyers (Lisa) plays the sympathetic girlfriend really well for a relatively newcomer, Robert Rusler who I recognised from another 80's classic (Weird Science) plays it cool as the best friend and has all the best lines. Clu Gulager and Hope Lange played the parents really well they had wonderful chemistry together and they were the heart of this movie I thought, and lastly the true star of this movie Robert England Here, his Freddy swagger and line delivery were showcased much better than they were in the first film.All in all a highly underrated sequel that has been overshadowed through the years by the flashier entry's, but the fact is Freddy is still scary in this one and I easily prefer this one to Part 5 and Freddy's Dead.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
99,Darkside-Reviewer,He's back! the man behind the fadora,6,18 May 2020,The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie was released in 1984 and was one of the best selling slasher movies ever made and would later become a horror movie classic and cement Freddy Kreuger (Robert England) as one of the most notorious slasher movie icon's of all time along with other such Icon's as Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) Chucky (Brad Dourif) and Pinhead (Doug Bradley).A Nightmare on Elm Street part 2 was rushed into production after the success of the first movie and it really shows as a result. The script while certainly interesting and different compared to the original movie it tried to change the rules set up by Wes Craven in the first movie by bringing Freddy Kreuger into the real world which defeats the whole point of the first movie that established Freddy only ever existing in people's dreams even when it appeared he was in the real world it was only ever a dream and in the end he was defeated by Nancy not letting him have her fear anymore breaking his power over her. The new idea of Freddy entering the real world proved unpopular with fans as a result Nightmare part 3 was written with Wes Craven which fixed the mistakes of this movie so much so that A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors became a fan favourite and was the highest grossing movie in the franchise until Freddy Vs Jason in 2003.This movie isn't a bad movie by any means it still has scary Freddy Kreuger in it and it dared to do something different with it's story sadly it just wasn't the best follow up to the original when people wanted more of Freddy killing in people's dreams this new idea would probably have been more successful as one of the later entries rather than a direct sequel to the original.The special effects and makeup in this movie look amazing in the opening scene there's a simulated earthquake where the ground breaks open and falls away and the effects look amazing for only a small budget to do it with looking better than most modern day special effects also Freddy Kreugers face in this has a distinctive wet look to it making his burns look fresh and bloody rather than burnt and scared something the sequals didn't do again so it's certainly unique and gives Freddy a more burn victim look.Something a lot of people don't know about this movie is that it was actually one of the leading gay movies of the 1980s and actually helped a lot of people struggling coming to terms with their sexuality come out as gay the movies gay symbolism along with quite a lot of close male bonding and a graphic scene of Freddy killing a gym teacher tied up naked after Freddy whips his behind with towels there's actually more male nudity in this movie than female nudity this movie was actually more forward thinking and daring than other movies in the slasher genre and others especially when you consider that this movie was released when the Regan administration was in office.I recommend watching this movie if your a horror and slasher movie fan ignore reviews that say that this is the worst Freddy movie of them all because it isn't and it still has scary Freddy in it so it's better than Freddy with a Nintendo power glove hands down.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Freddy Krueger is back and now he wants a body to kill in the real world. Robert Englund is amazing as always, the last girl Kim Myers is perfect and lovely, Mark Patton is a great actor playing a young boy being stalked by Freddy. The script is a kind different to the original one: a male teenager struggled with problems about his sexuality and his family behavior about their weird son, also a man being the lead role in a slasher film was something new. Jack Sholder is a good film director.

101,sashank_kini-1,Not bad....,5,14 April 2010,"I bought this one just to keep a track of the continuity of the series. And I was surprised that this movie had been berated by so many people who perceived it to be horrendous, badly acted, not at all spooky ( which I have to agree upon) and. However, I found this movie to be almost a good one, with commendable acting, a somewhat sensible story (compared to the others in the series), a different approach towards the film, not at all spooky, even for a moment, though engaging at times, all because of good acting, not like the pretentious, shallow performance of Heather something.The story starts off with a ominous looking bus with a crazy driver who takes the guys for a ride. It all happens to be a dream. Mark wakes up, extremely spooked up, after screaming like a girl. Though I can forgive this, since he has acted well the rest of the film. He keeps dodging his parents, who bring up all sorts of reasons and explanations for his strange behavior, like drugs etc. His uncaring father though feels that he is just being a spoiled brat. Mother does a reasonably well job for a horror film, father too is tolerable, sister (the character in the film) is barely noticeable. Enter Meryl Steep lookalike Kim Myers. I feel sorry for the girl. She does a fine job too but is ignored just because of her resemblance to Streep. She too is worried for Mark, who keeps telling her that everything is fine. Then there is Mark's friend/enemy don't know his name who keeps getting punished with Mark. Then there is a gay gym coach who likes to see them sweat. Here lies the problem. Probably the director had good intentions of showing the character of the coach being gay, because of spending most of the time with boys.But since the director isn't Scorsese or Hitchcock, he shows the scene in an awkward manner. They could have just cut off the S&M bar scene. They could have shown Mark somewhere in the streets and being taken by the professor to the gym instead. This would at least get rid off the gay undertones of Mark. In fact, the entire bar scene was so awkward to watch. Or they could have just cleared all doubts and accusations by just stating that the character was gay or bisexual. Also the towel whipping scene was so unintentionally hilarious. What was the director thinking? Someone stars bleeding by getting whipped with a towel.Yuck!!!Nothing scared me in the film. Probably the director hated animals or something. Birds gone crazy, dogs with unusual faces (was that really necessary), cat eating rat (so funny!), and a cluster of other animals dying in various manners. Wow! What happened to the PETA? Animals dying or shown suffering in a film is like a trigger for them.Even the story is implausible. Freddy controlling someone was understandable and the entire party scene was ridiculous.

None of the actors could act their way out of a wet paper bag (bar Robert Englund). Mark Patton really does a terrible job as the main character and he screams like a dying old woman.

Freddy Krueger was the new king of the hill in the realm of horror movies. Audiences flocked to the theaters and it brought in 10 times what it cost to make it. Despite all the build up, most walked out of the theater underwhelmed and disappointed.This films picks up 5 years after the events of the first one. A new family has moved into the house that Nancy Thompson and her mother used to live in. We are centered around Jesse Walsh, the boy who takes up living in Nancy's old room where he discovers her diary tucked away in his closet. He finds out that the man haunting him in his dreams and trying to take over his soul is Freddy Krueger. Krueger slowly drives him to the brink of insanity while people are dying around him.Despite having some memorable visuals and scenes - ie: the opening bus in the desert sequence, the swimming pool party, the eyeball at the back of the throat, and the demonic dogs with the human faces - this film breaks all the rules that Wes Craven had established in the first movie. The acting was poor and the plot/story was ill contrived.I felt this was one of the weaker entries in the franchise. I do still watch it from time to time today and it has a home in my collection. It isn't necessarily a bad movie, but it is a departure from the rest of the series as the next movie got things back on track. I give it 6 stars out of 10.

It's done to the best of its ability. And I've always liked Jack Sholder as a director. He seems to handle supernatural or fantastical very well.However, as far as titling it ""Freddy's Revenge"" it's not really.Because he doesn't reap revenge on anyone who done him wrong. Instead, he inhabits a teenager who has wild dreams of violence towards his classmates and gym teachers which happens to come true. We eventually discover that Freddy is now...a body invader!No big surprise.I'm trying to recollect my first time watching this back in 1985, but instead, I recall reading the book adaptation to it (too poor to go to the theaters back then). It gives a little more insight into how these things are happening. Also, juicier details on the violence. I kind of recall feeling dirty after reading it. Thanks Scholastic books!But, again, it was one of those movies you watched in those days to see horrific dream killin' I think at that age, the idea of Freddy was scarier than this execution. I would say this is also the last of the serious Freddy before he becomes a one-liner machine.There are a lot of the staple dumb decisions of people that gets them killed. And they do milk a lot of the tension with Freddy ""playing"" with his victims before they are murdered. Some more gruesome than others (Robert Ruslers is awful, simply because you don't see the actual disembowelment).That said, as far as trying to follow up Nightmare 1 with something more interesting...it's not bad.

The opening sequence on the bus is a memorable thrill ride. The film boasts some bloody FX. Charles Bernstein's theme music is missed, but Bing Crosby's song 'Did You Ever See A Dream' makes for a nice touch.

However, I'm also not enough of an adoring fan to ignore the fact that this film suffers a great deal as a result of the absence of Freddy's creator, Wes Craven, who was very adamant about wanting Nightmare to be a one-off horror movie. He wanted to lay the story down, and let that be it.
It still has a certain amount of charm, however. The homosexual undertones in this film are blatantly apparent and make up a large part of Jessie's character, but it's still an entertaining enough story that passes an hour and some without putting me to sleep. If anything, this movie is missing Robert Englund's presence. His screen time in this one is minimal.
As with the original, we get lots of those cheesy 80s special effects that we love so much. It adds a charm to this movie. It doesn't really hold a candle when you compare it to the original, but it's still an alright film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

A family has moved into the house where Nancy was locked behind bars installed by her alcoholic mother. Strange things happen in the house and boy, one scene is quite creative. Probably won't see that again in another film. The teenage boy alternates between insomnia and bad dreams with night sweats. If I had been forced to see him entangled in his sweaty bedspread one more time I don't think I could have handled it. And what is it about the open, button down shirt all the time? That wasn't an 80's thing.Despite the flaws, of which there are many, the film has an eerie, creepy feel to it in a sort of distasteful way. Too bad that some of the acting is bad, even by Hope Lange. Even Freddy seems unsure as to what to do here. Kill? Stare? Stand still? Move? What? Gone are the campy moments from the original that make it so endearing and cult-like. Here, everything is played serious without any comedy. I would say that this is unique but some of the scenes are so odd that they sort of derail the story.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
112,emperor_bender,Had good qualities,6,19 February 2008,"This movie seems to be the outcast of the series, as Friday the 13th Part V was in that series. I liked this movie, but at times I wanted to just turn it off. The pacing seemed a bit off at times. The characters were great in this movie, my favorites were the jock Ron Grady and the sadistic, S&M Coach Schneider. Both of the actors are in other movies I like too, which worked out well. Freddy seems a little disproportionate in this film, he has abilities no one knew about and can do things you know he originally couldn't. Jesse was pretty good but some times you just wanted to jump through the screen and punch him. I give this a 6/10, not bad, but could have been better.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
113,skybrick736,A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2,3,28 October 2011,"Part 2 of A Nightmare on Elm Street takes a different route on how Krueger kills. Instead of killing through dreams he uses the body of an individual on Elm Street to do the killing for him. The continuation of the storyline between Part 1 and Part 2 doesn't match in the slightest. As far as the movie goes, it could have been a lot better. There was a lack of characters and the two leads weren't anything special or memorable. Krueger himself is not as menacing and doesn't have the typical Krueger snapping lines that you love to hear. Freddy's Revenge is nearly a fail and should only be really viewed once unless your an avid Freddy fan. Not that good!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
114,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,5,8 December 2004,"This new review system is great! Unlike this film!!Genius. Anyway, part 2 introduces a new set of characters and barely links back to the first film, except that one of the characters hears that a girl went mad in the house Jesse, the main character, has moved into. The whole film could conceivably be someone else's nightmare, perhaps Nancy's, or an unknown character, at least then it would make more sense.Jesse has been having nightmares, and some of his friends have been dying in ways somehow connected to his dreams. It seems old Mr. Krugger is up to his...old...tricks, and is taking over Jesse's body and mind. Who will win? The film has this interesting idea, some nice effects, but that is all. Some average acting, poor script, some awful music and awful homo-erotic 80's fun and games. The original deserved a much better sequel",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

116,theshadow908,"Boring, dull, and pointless.",1,21 June 2006,"A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, tells the story of a new family that's moved into Nancy Thompson's house from the first film. The teenage son begins having disturbing dreams involving Freddy Krueger, and throughout the film, Freddy gradually takes over the teen's body so he can continue his killing spree outside of the dream world. This movie doesn't even have the same style as the first film, and the deaths are more violent and more ridiculous than before.When the first Nightmare film was so good, it was hard to think the second film would be so utterly bad. The problem is that the script just doesn't have the same style and charm as the first movie. Wes Craven managed to create a creepy atmosphere, whereas this movie is like a joke. Freddy Krueger hardly appears throughout the film, and when he does, it's under the stupidest circumstances. There's one huge plot hole that bothers me. Why has this teenage boy who is moving into a house where bad things happened, on a street where bad things happened never heard of Freddy Krueger? Everything that was done right in the first movie was done wrong here.The acting is just awful. Even Robert Englund seemed weak in the role that made him famous. Then again, he wasn't in the movie very much.Overall, this movie is terrible and doesn't fit with the first film at all.1/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
117,room102,Really bad,3,9 October 2015,"I never thought much of the Elm Street series - it always seemed silly and goofy to me. I just liked to see the ""nightmares"" bits for their special effects - most of them were laughable, while others were pretty good and imaginative.I haven't seen this particular sequel in over 20 years, but it's just as bad as I remembered it. Even if you ignore all the gay elements in this movie, it's still really bad. The writing and performance of almost everyone in the cast is just terrible and that's enough to ruin the movie.The plot change of Freddy possessing the lead actor to kill for him just doesn't fit the main idea the original movie or the rest of this (bad) series. But at least Freddy is not nearly as goofy as they made him in the following sequels.There are only two good elements in this movie: Christopher Young's score (which is almost always a treat) and some of Kevin Yagher's makeup effects.Sequels ranking: 3>4>2>7>6>5",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
118,bh_tafe3,A stand alone movie that falls over rather quickly,4,6 December 2008,"""Some directors try to express themselves through the horror genre, some directors try to do so in spite of the horror genre, I'm one of the latter"" says Freddy's Revenge director Jack Sholder on the making of documentary. Fair Enough.Exactly what he was trying to express in this movie, argued by some as being one of the more campy horror films of the 1980s or any other decade for that matter, is up for debate. But express himself he does. Which possibly explains why this movie seems totally out of place in the nightmare cannon.OK, it's a few years on from the events of the original nightmare and a new family has moved into Nancy's old house. Our hero, and as it turns out our villain as well, is Jesse Walsh, played rather effeminately by Mark Patton, who is the oldest son of Elm Street's newest family. He gets himself a woman and life is going great, until he meets Freddy Krueger, played once again with a lot of menace and a surreal quality by Robert Englund.Krueger would like to be able to kill again, but to do this he needs to borrow Jesse's body. And after a few slip ups Jesse is able to triumph over Freddy with the help of his gal Lisa. None of this happens before Jesse murders his gym teacher after a towel whipping, cuts up his best friend, and crashes a pool party. The movie ends with a tie in to another sequel, but they decided, happily, to go a different direction for the next movie.This is a fairly bizarre movie for a number of reasons. Firstly there are many who claim it isn't a movie about Freddy, it's a movie about a guy who goes nuts and kills a lot of people, thinking he's Freddy. If you view the film from that perspective, I think it works a lot better. Because the story, taken literally, is a little bit silly.While effeminate, I actually think Mark Patton does a fine job as Jesse Walsh, adding some type of personality to a rather bland character. The deaths are either not elaborate enough, or far too unpleasant. There's not really the creative, fun kills in this one we saw in its predecessor.Some of the effects are good, the shot at the start of the movie of a bus dangling over a cliff looks pretty impressive really. Some of them are appalling. But what this movie really lacks is a sense of dread or foreboding. This one keeps you interested by being strange, while the first keeps you interested by being well... interesting.There is some nudity in this and one of the death scenes isn't very pleasant. Not for everyone. A bizarre change of pace, unlike any other film in the original series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
119,Med-Jasta,A mix of good and so funny it's bad,6,4 September 2021,"The story is cool. And that's about it. The acting is very inconsistent. I don't think they're bad, they were just poorly directed. This is an example showing that this is how Hollywood thinks teenagers think and talk. The whole thing with the dad was so weird. As well as the teacher...The best part is definitely the special effects. It was nice to see in 2021. This is a lost art these days so it was nice to see and in top form. I'm not against digital. It looks better, you don't have to cut around it, it's easier on shooting and it's more realistic. If the studio wants to put the money into it. It's fun to see as a grown up because I know all the behind the scenes tricks and can see where they have to cut. Not in a bad way but in a appreciating way. Because these are top notch.I was entertained in a few different levels. Because Freddy trying to come out of the dream world was really cool. But so much stuff kept me laughing. Like the pool scene was cool. But then the teen trying to talk Freddy down like he was a kid with a gun was hilarious. And parents hardly noticed that it was almost 100 degrees. It's worth it to get to the 3rd movie. Actually you can just skip this one.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
120,jcbutthead86,"A Flawed,Yet Interesting Entertaining Sequel.",8,1 March 2013,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2:Freddy's Revenge is a flawed,yet entertaining sequel to the first Nightmare On Elm Street. Although not as good as the first Freddy's Revenge is an interesting film filled with creepy direction,good atmosphere,edgy subject matter and special effects.Set five years after the original Nightmare,Freddy's Revenge tells the story of a teenager named Jesse Walsh(Mark Patten)who's family has moved into Nancy Thompson's house(from the original)on Elm Street. While there Jesse begins having nightmares about dream demon Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund)who has returned to possess Jesse's dreams and body to have Jesse kill for him. With help of his friend Lisa(Kim Myers),Jesse must figure out how to destroy Freddy and save his soul.In between the excellent classic original A Nightmare On Elm Street and the brilliant second sequel A Nightmare On Elm Street 3:Dream Warriors came A Nightmare On Elm Street 2:Freddy's Revenge,a film that has divided Elm Street fans since it's release. Some like the film while others hate it,I think I fall into the former category because while this film is flawed it's not as bad as people have said. FR is a bold movie to make because while it is a sequel to the first this film takes on a new direction which is it's biggest strength and biggest weakness. The film's strength is the way the film has the feel of a ghost story or a haunted house movie where there are strange things going on and we can't figure out why they're happening which gives the film a creepy sense of dread and fear and the film puts viewers on edge from the beginning with a dark atmosphere that hangs over the movie. It's weakness is the film's lack of nightmares,imagination and originality the first one had. With the exception of two really effective nightmare scenes,this film really doesn't have many nightmare sequences,with Freddy invading the real world instead of dreams. With Freddy being in the real world it makes Freddy seem a lot less powerful and has impact then in the first film where Freddy had more control and in the first film you weren't sure if you were in a dream or in reality this film lacks the original ambiguity. The real world idea worked better in Wes Craven's New Nightmare. The most talked subject about FR is the film's homo-erotic undertones and gay themes. I have to admit when I first saw the film I didn't really notice until I came on the internet where the homo-erotic theme was discussed. Did that mean Jesse's character was gay or just bisexual and struggling with his sexuality?(It doesn't help matters that lead actor Mark Patten is gay in real life)It could be said that Freddy Kruger possessing Jesse and coming out of his body is a metaphor for Jesse to come out the closet. It was pretty bold taking on a homo-erotic theme in the 80s especially in a Horror film during the time AIDS was just beginning. Freddy has a lot more screen time and lines this time around,but,is smartly kept in the shadows throughout the film which makes the character scarier and very effective and his actions more frightening and when you watch the film you will feel like no one is safe from Freddy's wrath and destruction. The violence and gore in the film is straight forward and well-done,even though it's not as bloody as the first film it's still effective. The ending of the film is shocking and creepy and a good cap-off to this movie,although it's not as good as the first one's ending. I like all the original Elm Street films,but if I were to rank this one,I put below 1,7,3 and 4,but above 5 and 6 mainly because of the subject matter and tone of this film but like I said before I like the whole series.The cast does good jobs in their roles. Mark Patten does a wonderful job as Jesse,bringing depth and likability to the role. Kim Myers(who looks like Meryl Streep)does a great job as Lisa,Jesse's love interest. Robert Englund is scary and frightening as Freddy,having more lines and screen time this time around. Robert Rusler shines as Ron Grady,Jesse's new friend. Clu Gulager and Hope Lange do superb jobs as Mr. and Mrs Walsh,Jesse's parents. Marshell Bell is truly disturbing as gay S&M gym teacher Coach Schnieder. Sydney Walsh does a fine job as Kerry,Lisa's friend.The direction by Jack Sholder is great with Sholder giving the film a sense of dread and dark,creepy atmosphere with great camera angles. Great job by Sholder.The score by Christopher Young is effective,creepy and memorable and fits in with the film's dark tone,even though the film was missing the NOES theme from the original. A wonderful score. Also there some good songs like Did You Ever See A Dream Walking(Bing Crosby),Whisper To A Scream(Bobby Orlando and Claudja Barry)and All Night Long(Fonda Rae).The special effects and make-up by Kevin Yagher is outstanding and realistic especially the make-up on Freddy which is frightening and disturbing. Great make-up effects.In final word,if you love the first Nightmare or it's sequels I suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street:Freddy's Revenge a flawed,yet entertaining sequel to the Horror classic. Recommended. 7.5/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
121,jldmp1,Whose Nightmare?,5,27 July 2006,"Whatever writing influence Craven had on this, it wasn't enough to save it...not enough to overcome the TV-quality eye of director Sholder.The value of these movies is found in what degree Craven can have fun with us by making Freddy have fun with his 'victims'. The first one was mildly clever in how the line between 'real' and 'not real' was blurred. This time, the acting, props and editing are much improved. The narrative smarts are absent, though. It's too slow and it can't find its own center. What's the scary part, the villain? The house? The fear of possession? So it resorts to the cheap device of borrowing from other movies; the high school dynamics from ""Grease"", ""Fast Times..."", and ""Risky Business""; the horror from John Carpenter's films and ""The Amityville Horror""; the noir from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"".This is forgettable, so it has accordingly been forgotten.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
122,Coffee_in_the_Clink,The last twenty minutes completely ruin it,6,10 November 2021,"It didn't take long for New Line to cash in on the unprecedented success of Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Craven moved on so a new director and writer stepped in and less than a year after the first, the sequel followed. It is not a bad film by any means. In fact, I find it to be on a par with the first for the most part. Until we get past the hour mark and into the final act. Then the poor script begins to implode and the director is left snatching at ideas and completely ruins the character of Freddy Krueger and insults the audience and Wes Craven in the process. Freddy is defeated by love? Come off it. And the final scene on the bus is just a complete cop-out and makes no sense. They really ran out of ideas. Which is a shame, because this film set out to be something different and original to the first, and succeeded for the most part. Freddy taking possession of a young man in order to carry out his evil work in the waking world rather than the dream, was quite clever and shows that the crew behind this one were not out to make a carbon-copy of the first. But from the shambles they made of the last act, you have to ask was it for the better or not.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

There are plenty of elements and stretches in this that I did hate sitting through though.The first 30-40 minutes is actually terrible. Its clumsy and sloppily set up. If you were like me, then you imagined that this would be centered around Freddy getting revenge on some character from the original. Based on the title how would one not think this? Little did I know, this was, in fact, a possession movie that has little to do with original outside of taking place in the same house. For no good reason, Freddy wants to use the main character as a vessel to kill in the real world.Which not only breaks down the most interesting aspect of the original, dying in your dreams, but it also begs the question, why him? Why does Freddy want this specific guy to do the killing for him? The way he goes about possessing this guy makes it seem like he could be using anyone. Which makes the the main character feel a little undercooked. He has next to no character and is developed so little I was questioning how he ended up in a relationship with a rich girl.He has no charisma or charm in the least. He drives a rich girl to school for some reason and then they fall in love for some reason. The script is a lazy mess of plot beats that they had no idea how to fully realize. They knew they needed certain beats at certain points and they fill the space in between them with meandering. Characters apparently research Freddy off camera while a character wanders around for 10 minutes while Freddy pesters them. Lame.Speaking of Freddy, he is unfortunately lost in this. The whole story revolves around him taking control of the main character and we barely see him. Why does he even want to possess this guy? Again, he doesn't seem specifically special, but Freddy also seems perfectly capable of killing in dreams. So why not keep doing that? Why would he even want to be real with a power like that? Until the final twenty minutes there's hardly any kills either. And even then all he does is swipe at people and they fall over. Lame.Freddy's Revenge makes little sense on various levels. The most egregious of this is the premise being inherently flawed and it's terribly boring. Little to nothing happens for the longest time and when things start to happen there's even less reasoning behind it. It's a sloppy mess that does nothing interesting really. There are a couple cool visuals, like Freddy tearing his way out of the stomach of the main character. And there's a few quotable lines sprinkled in there, but it's mostly dull and lame.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

126,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Freddy's back for revenge - really criminally underrated sequel,10,27 January 2019,"In my opinion it is really criminally underrated sequel it is in my top 5 favorite Elm Street films. It is my fourth favorite Elm Street slasher film. Freddy's back the Walshes moved into Thompson's old house, 5 years after the events of the first movie. The movie mentions Nancy Thompson a lot from the first film and her diary. The main character Jesse find's her journal one day and Jesse is experience some nightmares of Freddy Krueger and Freddy wants to posses Jesse's body.Jesse is killing some people, his killing his coach. There are melting some things in the house a parrot explodes. Freddy can posses things in the house objects and start things on fire. By the end of the film Freddy comes out of Jesse's body and kills his best friend and his girlfriend tells Jesse to fight against Freddy and that's what he does.This movie breaks a lot of rules from the first movie that was already told a lots of times. Wes Craven did not return for this film he did not like the idea about Freddy manipulating the main protagonist. Heather Langenkamp did not return for the sequel, but Robert Englund did return as Freddy Krueger after this movie he will become a famous horror movie icon. This the only movie with the main male lead. In all ""Elm Street"" movies they are female leads in here the main lead is Mark Patton. I think Mark did a great job portraying Jesse Walsh. This film is considered gay I disagree about it and because of this film Mark Patton quit with acting but I have always liked him. It is a big step down of the first film. It lacks of originality of the first film. Some people said Freddy is only 13 min's in the film I did not noticed this, because the film is only long 1 hr and 25 mins and it is still a good one. Good one liners in the film. Jack Sholder did a good job directing the film, he directed later The Hidden (1987) another action horror flick.The main problem with the film for me is Freddy now can posses body's because in the first movie he was an evil spirit and he was hunting teens in their dreams. If you bring him in to real world you can pull him that he is no longer strong and you can kill him. In this sequel he can posses body's that just can't be. I don't like that Freddy is possessing people. Freddy suppose to be a dream stalker not possesing body's and killing people.The film has a good stuff the reasons why I like this film a lot, why it is in my top 5 favorite Elm Street franchise. The dream sequences are really good. Even tough they are not that many: in the opening sequence with Jesse on the bus and Freddy goes after him, really good atmosphere. On the bus are two girls they re really beautiful. The best part of this film is Robert Englund and the scenes he is in as Freddy. Kim Myers as Lisa Webber was a strong character lead as Lisa Jesse's girlfriend, she was the one who defeated Freddy. I like Kim Myers performance a lot, she was good to watch. I like the atmospheric sequence in which Jesse and Lisa goes to see this meal steal abandoned factory that Freddy Krueger used to worked I loved that scene. The ending I like a lot. Freddy is still dark to me and really creepy like he kills kids by the pool.I like the film should have be called the curse of Freddy Krueger more than The Curse of Michael Myers. A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) is still a good horror movie umm for the year 1985. The FX effect are still good, it still a true sequel to me I don't care what anyone says.

Don't get me wrong, it contains the scariest scene in any of the ""Nightmare"" flicks-  unfortunately, it contains our teen protagonist donning a pair of Elton John sunglasses and dancing to vintage eighties music while shutting drawers with his butt. Oh, the horror.Thankfully, the sequels that followed this piece of garbage ignored this one, which includes Freddy living in a power plant (huh?) and trying to possess the aforementioned bland youngster, who dreams of a Freddy-driven school bus.There are only two kills, and one is a middle aged, S & M loving gym teacher who is tied up with jump ropes and has his bare bottom slapped with towels until it is blood red. Lethal horseplay? Thank you, Freddy.There are a few good bits, including the great Clu Gulager in a supporting role. You also get to see Freddy bursting out of a guy's body and a truly disturbing shot of some dogs with child heads, but by the time these parts come about you'll be asking ""Is this movie over yet?!?""Also enjoy the scene where Freddy runs around a party chasing teenagers as beer cans explode.

129,Toronto85,A Nightmare on Elm St Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,5,21 March 2011,"This sequel to the brilliant A Nightmare on Elm Street is a major letdown. A new family moves into the house that Nancy from part 1 lived in. Soon after, a teenager named Jesse starts having nightmares of Freddy and all sorts of weird things start happening inside the house with the appliances and the temperature. It starts to appear that Freddy is taking over Jesse's body, making him wear the glove and everything. This time Freddy doesn't kill teenagers in their dreams, it's more of a possession storyline. Therefore there aren't many deaths and hardly any gore. The film takes us to the boiler room/factory where Freddy used to work and kill. Jesse and his girlfriend Lisa uncover the story of Freddy and what he did, etc, etc.The big conclusion takes place at Lisa's house where she is hosting a pool party for her friends. That's where most of the film's excitement and mayhem take place. The acting is very good in this movie, Mark Patton and Kim Myers are good in the lead roles. There are ""homoerotic elements"" to this which have been talked about since the movie came out in 1985. That isn't what makes this film a let down for me. What isn't good about the film is it's pacing and interest level. Freddy Krueger is hardly seen in this one at all. It's more of a fantasy/drama until the final 25-30 minutes.Freddy does look darker and creepier in this one (from the few scenes we see of him). He isn't the funny guy we all come to know him as in the later sequels. That hurts this movie too. There a few deaths and even fewer scares. I always felt that this was more a continuation of the story of Freddy Krueger. ANOES 2 focuses way too much on the back story and the possession of Jesse. It gets marks for the party scenes and for telling more of Freddy's story. But it moves at such a slower pace then the rest of series, it becomes tedious. I mean, Freddy doesn't kill anyone until 40 minutes into the film. There are many WTF moments as well. Exploding birds, workable toasters that aren't plugged in, Freddy smacking the coach's ass with a towel. It's a bizarre little film, but I like the introduction of the boiler room/factory where Freddy worked and where he brought his victims. Nancy had a dream of the place in part one, but Lisa and Jesse actually visit the place. This setting becomes very key for the rest of the series.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
130,Gresh854,The Biggest Step-down In Horror Movie History,3,5 August 2018,"In A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge, Freddy Kruger has a plan to convert his new victim, Jesse-who has just moved into Nancy's (the previous victim's) old house-into a host to carry out his kills in the real world rather than the dream world. This new concept approached within this sequel could most certainly be achieved if done properly, but the way the film plays it out is done way too leisurely and often with little to no spirit, resulting in legitimate disbelief from audience members like myself. Considering that the main character is such a whiny, cowardly, little, nuisance, his random transition into a serial killer truly feels unconvincing, unlikely, and at times, immensely random. Yes, some may say he's just becoming possessed but honestly, the film is so careless to explain even minor bits of information on how the hell certain exploits are occurring, that it becomes quite maddening. Also, all the supernatural elements the film offers make absolutely little to no sense-considering when they happen they don't take place in a damn dream (at least I think they didn't). Every character dynamic or relationship presented in the movie doesn't work like the film seems to think it does, which is as well, aggravating. The script is often atrocious; its attempts to recall certain plot-points from the original feel cheap, and eminently obvious. You can tell the actors/actresses are giving it their absolute all but considering the material they've been given, most of their performances come off as laughable (which isn't entirely any of their faults, more so the writers). The only saving grace in this movie is whenever Freddy Kruger appears on screen; Robert Englund's performance within this franchise is everlastingly memorable. All in all, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is one of the most disappointing direct from the original, horror sequels I've ever witnessed.

131,Mr_Censored,"One, Two...Freddy's trying to get inside of you...",5,14 October 2008,"Without question, the most controversial film of the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" franchise would be the second installment, ""Freddy's Revenge."" This sequel sticks out amongst a pile of 80's horror because our lead victim is a teenage boy, instead of the usual girl-next-door. No doubt, you've heard the debate -- probably read about it on this very site -- so I'll spare you. Watch the film and draw your own conclusions.Jesse Walsh and his family have moved to 1428 Elm Street, five years after the events of the first film, and right off the bat, the dreams start coming. Morning after morning, Jesse wakes up with an ear-piercing screech and a cold sweat. He also finds himself wandering in the late hours of the night, popping up in his kid sister's bedroom, his high school and even an S & M bar. It doesn't take long until he discovers the legend that is Freddy Krueger and what he has planned. It seems Ol' Finger-Knives wants into the real world and is using Jesse to get that job done. Whether it's his classmates, an overly cruel gym teacher or a parrot, it seems no one is safe until Jesse and his girlfriend Lisa put the legend to rest.""Freddy's Revenge,"" although entertaining slasher fare, sticks out like a sore thumb with the rest of the series. Truth be told, they didn't know exactly how to do a ""Nightmare"" sequel at this point, and it shows. So you can't really hold the fact that this film doesn't cling to any mythos against the filmmakers. At the end of the day, it's a Freddy flick, and at the very least, it's different from the rest, which means you're likely to watch it more than a few times if you are a fan of the series. Most of the film lacks suspense, but doesn't skimp on the gore. There are some pretty nasty visuals in the film that warrant a view from any horror fan. Consider it a guilty pleasure. If you can get past the odd story-telling and the lack of substance, you'll have fun with ""Freddy's Revenge.""",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
132,dormesher-21565,"""You Are All My Children Now""...... Solid Sequel",8,20 January 2020,A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2 Freddy's Revenge. A solid sequel that has some interesting ideas and a dark feel to it and is a decent follow on from the original not one of the best in the series but a solid sequel.Freddy is great in this one he is dark and twisted and the idea of him possessing someone to get stronger is a great idea and good twist on Freddy although it does kinda break rules of Freddy but I appreciate this movie doing something different and it's a unique twist.The kills are fun I especially the kill where Freddy is coming out of Jesse its a great scene and definitely the best moment of the film the effects still hold up and looks amazing and creepy still to this day.The characters are interesting and we do get a bit more backstory for Freddy with him working in a power plant. However I do wish we got more but what we got is very interesting.The only issue I have is I think Lisa would of been better if she was the main hero of the film the fact that Jesse is the hero and the one being controlled by Freddy it makes it hard to connect with him like you would with Nancy or Alice later on in the franchise and I think Lisa would of been the better hero of story in my opinion.Still it's solid sequel that has some unique fun ideas not one of the best in the series but it's still a fun solid sequel that I enjoy and is very fun and I appreciate it doing something different. I also like the idea of them using the Diary of Nancy to help them.Verdict 8/10 a solid and great idea for a sequel with some unique ideas and great kills and characters does break the rules but appreciate it trying something new. And I think Lisa would be a better hero but still a fun solid sequel.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
133,CMRKeyboadist,Yet Another Misunderstood Horror Film,7,12 February 2007,"I have been watching this film series for many years now. The first of the ""Freddy"" films I actually saw was part 3, which is still the best in my opinion. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is truly a lime in the series, as far as fans of the series go. That doesn't mean it is a bad horror movie. Actually, after watching this one for many years I have come to rather enjoy it. You might want to put this movie into the category with other horror sequels like Halloween 3 because they go against the traditional sequels. Actually, if you take Freddy out of this movie and replace him with just another dead serial killer this movie would hold its own as an original horror film. This movie also has very little trademarks of the series in it. For one, the infamous Freddy music is completely gone from this movie. Instead, we have quite a nice atmospheric, if not very dark soundtrack from Christopher Young. Also, the Freddy glove is in this movie, but if you look closely at times Freddy isn't wearing the glove. Instead, the blades are protruding through his fingers.Also, you get quite a bit of bizarre things in this movie that seem inspired from many other horror films. We have a killer bird, many haunted house type scenes including objects moving on their, things blowing up. We have dogs with human faces on them, a perverted gym teacher and last but not least Freddy possession scenes. Throw all of this together and you get quiet a strange flick.Another thing that I liked about this movie were the special effects. The effects in this movie must have opened a few peoples eyes back when it came out because they are truly disturbing. Look for the scene where Freddy is clawing his way out of our leads body.I guess the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the lead character of Jessy. I found him to be obnoxious and kind of a wimp. At least in the first movie Nancy was all down for trying to do something about Freddy killing everyone around her. Jessy would rather act like a baby at times.All around, I liked this film and I think it needs to be looked at again by some people. I know I certainly don't look at it as a true sequel to the original, part 3 is the true sequel. But, I think this movie is still a lot of fun and recognition is definitely due. 7/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
134,d_m_s,Equal to the original. Freddy is better and it's funnier.,9,5 February 2013,"OK, Nightmare on Elm Street 2 seems to be a love it or hate it film, with most people hating it.Some reviewers seem concerned that Freddy possesses the body of new-boy-in-town, Jesse, to do the killings rather than killing everyone in their dreams but I couldn't really care less about that. It has no negative impact on the film whatsoever.I've seen this film a handful of times and I've appreciated it more with each viewing, to the point where I now think it is as good as the original and perhaps even better in some ways. Here's why...Let's start with Freddy. Director Jack Sholder made a good choice in keeping Freddy in the shadows for most of his scenes, therefore making him a lot more mysterious and menacing than in the first film. Freddy also does a lot less talking, which is a bonus. Overall it gives him a less human and more demon-esque quality.Despite what some others may say, I think this film is directed perfectly, mainly because the directing is apt for the subject and doesn't try to be anything more. It's just a small element that adds up to the whole. The heavy use of smoke and some very nice lighting adds to the overall horror aesthetic and atmosphere.The intro is excellent, I've always felt this was shot really well and the bit with the school bus balancing on a tall rock with the pits of Hell or God knows where below, are very surreal and nightmarish.Then there's the humour. I mean, there are so many visual and verbal jokes (often homosexual) in this film that I find it hard to believe Jack Sholder was oblivious to this, as has been stated in the IMDb trivia section for this film.Just some of the funny bits: -Jesse's extremely long, shrill, wailing, old woman-esque scream. The most hilarious use of this is at the beginning when it is heard off-screen and the rest of the family are all at breakfast.-Jesse's friend, Grady, doing a whole scene while munching on burgers, making his dialogue almost inaudible.-Jesse cleaning his room while dancing in the campest way possible, which is followed by him closing a drawer by grinding his butt against it, followed by a visual innuendo gag whereby he holds a popping toy at his crotch, rubbing it in time with the music, only for it to pop just as his mum enters the room.-The budgie that bursts into flames for no reason.-Jesse's coach being tied up and having his butt whipped red raw with towels by an invisible assailant.-Jesse's best line: ""he's inside of me and he wants to take me again!"" Don't get me wrong, it's not that I think this film is so bad it's good, I actually feel I am laughing along WITH it rather than AT it.The film is short at 87 mins and keeps up a good pace. There is only one disappointment for me, which is that the first film has more gore and in some ways I feel this one is a little restrained. It's a small quibble and as far as I'm concerned, this film is a triumph. I'm sure that's entirely accidental as I don't believe for one second anyone involved in this production was trying to make a good film here, but they have succeeded none the less.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
135,AwesomeWolf,Almost unwatchable,1,6 July 2005,"Ever wanted proof of how an original movie (that is regarded by some as a classic) can easily descend into the realm of really pathetic sequels? Well, look no further than 'Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge'. You might not have expected it to be good in the first place, but thought ""it can't be THAT bad!"". I did. I was so very wrong.Five years after Nina Thompson's battle with Freddy, the Walsh family moves into the old Thompson residence, without knowing why it was so cheap and why no one has lived there for the past five years. Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) starts having nightmares about Freddy, while his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Myers) finds Nina Thompson's diary. It turns out Freddy needs to possess Jesse so that Freddy can start killing again, but Lisa knows how to play Freddy at his own game.What's wrong with 'Freddy's Revenge'? Well, nearly everything. For a horror movie, it doesn't have much of anything to actually scare. There's no tension, suspense, or atmosphere. Freddy's crazy dream world rarely appears. You might expect a series of bloody murders to keep slasher fans happy, and even then there is not enough action to keep people interested. The script in the first film wasn't very good, but the second is terrible. The lead actors are rather poor and lines like ""animals don't normally explode for no reason"" make it almost unwatchable.'Freddy's Revenge' is only for Freddy fans / horror buffs. Some of those people might even find something like about this film, but I didn't - 1/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Straight out of the 80s. Good horror film music very well composed, nice creepy atmosphere. This movie actually focused on the plot development of the Freddy Kruger story.

140,HorrorFan1984,A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,6,11 April 2020,"Freddy Krueger is back for revenge and to kill more kids on Elm Street in a sequel that most horror fans find disappointing. Giving a watch years after seeing it, and not thinking highly of it, I was pleasantly surprised in how much I enjoyed it.We meet our lead character Jesse who is having nightmares of Freddy Krueger. He and his family recently moved into the house on Elm Street where Nancy from the first film had to endure Krueger's attacks. After Jesse finds Nancy's old diary in his bedroom, he learns who that man with the knives for fingernails is and just how dangerous he can be.Freddy starts to take over Jesse's body in almost a possession like way. The high school gym teacher is slashed to death in the shower, and Jesse sees the entire thing happen ... he even has the bloody glove on afterwards. After another murder, the scene is set at Lisa's pool party where Freddy escapes from Jesse's body and starts killing the guests. All leading to a fiery conclusion at the boiler room where Lisa will have to bring Jesse out of Freddy sending him to hell once and for all.I didn't mind Part 2 watching it today as much as I thought I did years ago. It had a pretty good cast, character development with Jesse, and Freddy Krueger of course. A couple of things do however make Part 2 inferior to the original. A big one is the lack of Freddy Krueger and Robert Englund. Because Freddy takes over Jesse's body to act out the killings, we don't get a lot of him and his burned face which I felt really hurt the movie. Also, the whole idea of Freddy not killing teenagers in their dreams was a letdown. That is the thing that separates the Elm Street series from any other slasher made in the 80's, but this sequel takes that completely away.Mark Patton does a very good job in the lead role of Jesse, which is of course normally held by a female in these films. His performance has been knocked in the past, but I didn't think it hurt this sequel at all. Kim Myers plays his girlfriend Lisa extremely well. Plus Hope Lange and Clu Gulager are a nice pair as Jesse's parents adding to the dysfunctional nature of Jesse's family life.Freddy's Revenge is a very watchable follow up to the original film. The problem with this sequel (like most sequels) is that it failed to live up to the high standards that we came to know from the first movie. The flaws in this one are fixed a year later in a very powerful the third entry.6/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
141,schroeder-gustavo,"Terrible, just awful",1,5 June 2015,"Being a huge fan of the first one (gave it 10/10) it kinda hurts to say this but I would be a coward if I didn't, but this is one of the worst movies I have seen in years, maybe ever. First complaint: the tone is so wrong in this movie. While the original Nightmare had that feel of being dark and gritty throughout, this one just feels like a massive 80's cheese-fest orgy. Also, the dialogue between the characters doesn't seem to make any sense and Jesse's acting just makes it worse. OHH the acting, it is beyond terrible. It's definitely worse than porn. I just said that, and I mean it. Also it seems like there are A LOT of gay sexual tones and the main character's terrible acting just makes it even worse. Freddy barely shows up in this one and when he does, it is truly forgettable. Definitely worth skipping this one, I hope the other Nightmares make up for this abomination against humanity.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

143,hoernkeem,"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985, Jack Sholder) Freddy returns as a shell of his former self... Craven's absence is apparent",1,30 August 2021,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' was released in 1984 and became an iconic horror movie as well as a financial success taking in $57 million worldwide on just a budget of $1.8 million. On the heels of that the studio knew they had a new slasher franchise that they wanted to capitalize on so it should surprise no one that 'Freddy's Revenge' hit theaters almost a year to the day after the original debuted. Gone, however, was the creative mastermind Wes Craven and that vacancy was felt as this was a not very scary almost farcical sequel that bares little resemblance the demon spawned dreamscape that came before it. It was a commercial success, however, taking in $30 million on just a $3 million budget so while the product may be creatively questionable the financial future of this slasher series was just getting started.The only lingering elements from the first film are, of course, Freddy himself and the house that Nancy occupied as we start with a family who has taken up residence in that house, horrible history aside. Of note I don't believe they ever actually mentioned Elm Street in the first movie, but here they do reference that original house being on Elm Street. Jesse Walsh is a teenage boy who starts having extremely vivid nightmares of this burned man with a glove of knives. As we know he is now being stalked by Freddy Krueger in his dreams. For a decent portion of the film Jesse is just tortured by nightmares and it becomes clear that Krueger is trying to inhabit or possess him in some fashion. He is able to do this twice and kill Jesse' gym teacher as well as his friend Grady. This is obviously Freddy's doing, however, to the rational world it is starting to look more and more like Jesse is a crazed killer. Jesse and his girlfriend discover Nancy's diary detailing her nightmares and encounters with Freddy. This gives them vital information into actually what is going on. Freddy comes out of him again attempting to kill his girlfriend, Lisa, but his care for her is too great and he will not allow Freddy that satisfaction. Freddy instead starts laying waste to coeds at a pool party before fleeing. Lisa catches up with Freddy/Jesse at the industrial plant where Freddy used to work and a battle ensues as Jesse attempts to fight off Freddy from taking complete control. Eventually Jesse's love wins out and they combust, however, when the fires dies Jesse is able to emerge apparently free of Freddy's influence. Of course we get a stinger at the end as, days later, they all get on a school bus and Freddy's arm bursts out of someone's chest as the bus goes careening into the desert.This sequel is ridiculous. The whole possession angle that they wanted to explore seems like something the character of Freddy wouldn't need or want. They never delved into or explained why all of a sudden he was more interested in taking over a kid's body rather than just doing his dream hopping slasher thing. The style here is 1980's to the max in look, feel, dialogue, music and execution. It is like the 80's vomited into your face and not in a good way. For a slasher/horror film this film actually had very little in the way of bloody slasher violence. This film has become a bit of cult movie with what some believe are underlying gay themes as the actor who played Jesse later came out as gay in real life, but even if that is the case this movie is still trash. Almost nothing remains stylistically or creatively from Craven's original vision other than the look of Freddy himself as portrayed by Robert Englund. The entire plot here is just an abysmal misstep and nothing in the production from the acting to the direction to the visual effects does anything to save this train wreck of a movie.Eric's Grade: F.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
144,tex-42,"Campy, yet awful sequel to great film",2,11 September 2005,"Taking place five years after the first Elm Street film, Part 2 rewrites the premise of the series, having Freddy possess the teenage boy now living in the Elm Street house allowing him to kill people whether they are awake or asleep.This film is weak for a number of reasons, but the major one has to be the awful acting of the protagonist of the film. Where Heather Lagenkamp was able to convey a teenager dealing not only with the death of her friends, but severe sleep deprivation in the first film, Mark Patton (Jesse) comes off merely as a drama queen (even though it might be appropriate since the actress playing his girlfriend looks so much like Meryl Streep).The second major weakness is the abandonment of the premise of the first film (and later sequels), that Freddy can only get you if you are asleep. Instead Freddy is able to materialize whenever he wants turning him into just another teen slasher.Finally, the last weakness is the script. The characters are poorly developed, the plot ebbs and flows at random, and the ""vanquishing"" of Freddy is laughable.However, despite these weaknesses the movie has wonderful camp value. Whether it was intentional or not, the movie has a homo-erotic subtext running through it and when viewed through that light, Freddy's Revenge can be pretty funny. This happens in scenes such as when Jesse worries about Freddy ""taking"" him again, when Jesse goes out and meets his high school coach at a leather bar, or when Jesse abandons his girlfriend to spend the night with his male best friend.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Move on to several years later and now the second instalment is ranked second best in the series.The acting is on par with the original and so doesn't make it feel like a cheap spin-off and Freddy remains in his darker and sinister persona. The story attempts to try and do something different, showing very little of Freddy through out the film and instead focusing on the main protagonists struggles to keep Freddy from taking over his mind and body.Reasons why this film is lowly rated is probably because the innovative charm has worn out and the third instalment is nothing but Freddy killing off people in zany ways, something all people want too see in horror.But unlike the later sequels, this film stays close to the original and is creepier than any other NOES.

Freddy has began his one liners and still retained most of his creepiness. But the camp value is way up! The film boasts silly dialogue, coupled with 80's movie music clichés and it's overly homo-erotic. The film is just a horror flick for gay men. which in truth I don't mind cause I am a gay man. But in this type of film I feel that we could've pushed aside the hardbodies and went straight for the chills. This chapter centers on jessie a socially awkward young man whom is plagued by nightmares in his new house. The same house Nancy used to live in supposedly. He wakes up sweat soaked in tightie whities screaming like a girl. Freddy taunts him as he wishes to take over and possess his body. working through him he commits many murders and body count flies up ridiculously. filled with good spfx and some decent acting and creative suspense. The film doesn't measure up to the original and suffers from sequilitus. But as a film on it's own it represents a different type of horror film.

However, before the film had met with financial success, he sold the sequel rights, a move he has long regretted.""Freddy's Revenge"" is not a disaster, but it pales in comparison to the original. The story is pretty routine stuff, empathizing special effects and gore over plot. However, the central concept is fairly intriguing, and makes for some scattered good moments. Mark Patton is not a thespian, but he generates sympathy as the central character, a young man trapped by dark forces.Robert Englund, reprising his role as Freddy Krueger, is as engaging as charismatic as ever. The character is a creation of modern makeup effects (kudos to Kevin Yagher), but without Englund, he wouldn't be much more.As the parents, Clu Gulager and Hope Lange are okay, if unexceptional. However, the film's worst, most thankless role goes to Marshall Bell as the sadistic Coach Schneider. His character is yet another stereotypical high school coach. The homosexual undertones (the guy even hangs out in a gay bar!) certainly don't help.With some imagination, NOES2 could have held its own with the original, but it becomes yet another victim of lazy screenwriting.

The movie comes no where near to beating the Original.The first movie had much better characters much better writing better directing and it was much darker because we didn't know Freddy that well so he seemed like more of a threat.But in this movie he's the opposite he comes across as more of a joker and not as scary as he was in the first film.I only remember two scenes when he was slightly scary in this sequel but it wasn't enough, I definitely wanted to see more of the scary Freddy and instead i got less. That's one of the big problems i have with the sequels, Freddy gets more and more comedic and I don't think that's how his character should have been, Even the director of the first film Wes Craven said he wanted Freddy to be scary and he never wanted to do sequels but they got made because hard-core fans wanted them, so different directors came to direct the sequels except the last one which Craven directed.He made the Last movie so he could bring Freddy back to his roots and make him scary again which he knew True fans of the Original movie would love and he was right people liked New Nightmare because Freddy returned to his old scary self. movie 2 was boring and there was no suspense or tension.It Lacked everything that made the first movie Great. Another problem for me is Mark Patton i don't like his character or his acting.He screams like a girl and he acts too feminine and having him act that way was a mistake in my opinion. During the scenes when he's supposed to be angry he pulls this kind of face like he's constipated or something. I watched that and I thought what kind of man are you?. He acts more like a girl then a guy for some reason.There is a really Dumb cringe worthy scene where he's dancing and singing on his bed and when I saw that scene i wanted to Puke and close my eyes that's how UNFunny it was.This movie needed a hero like Nancy who could kick Ass not this Lame Idiot.When Freddy Torments him he just stands there with this constipated look on his face that looks like a mixture between a girl that's about to have a hissy fit and a scared constipated child and it's laughable. The guy does not know how to act tough or look tough or be tough and he fails miserably as a main character. He was Boring and he was Not a Fighter and he wasn't much of a man.I thought Nancy was more of a man than he was and she's a Girl!. How Sad is that? Nancy from the first movie is more of a man than he is!.Nancy is also a much better character than him. Another problem i have with the movie are the gay references, I don't think the movie needed to be filled with Them. This is supposed to be a horror movie not a gay movie and all the subtle gay jokes and references felt weird and out of place in this movie and they should not have been in the movie.If people liked them fine good for you but I didn't like them, and having all of that Lame humour just made the film less scary and more of a Joke and I didn't watch the movie for jokes i watched the movie to be scared and entertained.This Movie should Not be called Freddy's Revenge either That title makes No sense.What Revenge? Revenge on who? Revenge on Nancy? who's NOT in this movie? (Yeah that makes loads of sense). Most of the characters in the movie i did not care about and That's another Big problem.When you have no-one to root for The movie becomes boring.The only character i Liked was Lisa.The only thing this movie has going for it are some good special effects and a few action scenes. I Liked the scene when Freddy ripped his skin off his head and said to Jesse you've got the body and I've got the brain.And Freddy trying to take over Jesse's body and trying to force him to kill people.The idea was interesting but it didn't work for me because of how it was done.The idea had potential but I don't think it was handled right. Another scene I Liked was the pool party scene when Freddy shows up and starts slicing people up and everyone screams and runs away.I admit the scene was entertaining but it was too short lived and the movie needed more scenes like that when Freddy Hacks people up instead we are treated to dumb jokes.A couple of jokes worked but most of them Failed. I am Not a Fan of this movie.I Get that the director wanted to do something different and there's nothing wrong with trying something different but it needs to be done the right way and It was done the wrong way. What made the first movie Great was the fact that the characters were fighting Freddy in the dream world and In the dream world he can do anything he wants which makes it more fun to watch but in this sequel everything happens in the real world.Overall it's Not my Cup of Tea.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
154,Punk19,The second is the best,7,11 November 2005,"I find this the unnoticed film that everyone is afraid to admit that they like. It's the 1986 sequel to the 1984 original Nightmare On Elm Street where Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund)tries to take over the body of a teenage teen named Jesse Walsh(Mark Patton)through his dreams.I think this movie had some pretty good deaths, although I would have liked to of seen the real Freddy Krueger sliced and dice Ron Grady, The Coach and kill that one teen at the party. Maybe that's why this movie hasn't made so much fans.I figure out that this film does need something in-between as it lacks that special touch of Freddy's evil sounding voice as it soars over the room in that hissing way. Made that is why I gave it one less start.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
155,jed-estes,Jesses's Gay!,7,6 September 2006,"This movie is one to watch with a group of friends on a boring night it will give you tons of material to make fun of and that is why I love this movie. When I first watched it I thought it to be just a piece of garbage to best be overlooked and go on to Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. But as I got older I realized that this film is so bad it's good. Mark Patton is one of the best actors in the series and his Jesse character is one of the most memorable. I love what he did with the role. I also like how he subtly makes you think maybe just maybe he's gay and not really just terrified by Freddy. Freddy almost acts a parable in this one. He is Jesse's homosexuality coming out but he can't say that because of the time he is living in. I know that is deep but that is what I take from this film and I find it funny. You could say this is just another slasher movie, and you would be right if that is the view you wish to take on this film, but I am here to tell you, if you watch this as a metaphor than it will greatly improve your experience of watching the film. Watch this one to laugh and makes jokes with your friends about.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

In this edition the makers tried to make freddy funny, and this took away a lot of his menacing, dark and evil side. Instead of being scared of Freddy the audience were thinking what is this guy doing. At least in this one he is still a little bit evil he gets more and more of a comedic character into the series until Wes Craven fixes all that with New Nightmare. Stick to the original and New Nightmare.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
157,jbartelone,Not Great. But Not Horrible Either.,5,18 October 2007,"Freddy's terror continues in this sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street! A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge has a new boy moving into the Elm Street neighborhood with his family. He is now living in the same house as Nancy and her mother from the first film. The difference is that this film doesn't build on dreams to create suspense. Freddy is alive in this movie and he inhibits the soul of the young boy.Sequels rarely equal their original predecessors. This film is no exception. Newcomer Mark Patton plays the troubled teen and while there are some scares, his character is very average. You don't really like or dislike him, but become apathetic. The twist of Freddy now being alive might have been more interesting if Freddy himself had more of a plot to work with in this sequel. There are not enough scares, suspense, or originality, that worked so well in the first film to maintain strong viewer interest.BUT, there are two decent scenes that build up in momentum. One is Freddy killing the mean gym coach. The second, which is chilling, is you see Jesse (Mark Patton's character) get up one night and as he goes from his bedroom out into the hall, you here this, ""thump thump, thump thump, thump thump"" than he opens a door in his house and you see a dream-like silhouette of a little girl playing jump rope in the bedroom and singing Freddy's signature song ""One two Freddy's coming for you..."" (etc.) very creepy I have to shut my eyes when that scene comes on because it freaks me out........terribly!NOES2 has some moments, but nowhere near enough of them to compare with the pacing, suspense, and dramatic impact of the original film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
158,frankwhat,Bit the Big One!,3,15 December 2004,"This was not a good movie. It wasn't scary, the acting was virtually terrible, and the plot was tough to follow. Why they didn't get Craven back as the director beats the hell out of me! The deaths were so cheesy and the special effects looked so fake it was totally unbelievable. The school bus rides made no sense and you basically needed a guide book just to understand what was happening. The scenes were in a completely illogical order and got confusing way too quickly! Freddy didn't have his snappy one-liners yet which also didn't help the overall cause either. I personally feel that this film basically was devoid of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's one where I'd be constantly checking my watch (even though it was short in length) and I even broke up viewing it since I was becoming so bored with it. What's scary is this was rated higher than some of the other sequels so I can only imagine how bad they are. Take a strong word of advice to stick to the original and don't stray too far away or you could become lost in the kingdom of boredom forever!Final Slash:Movies: Ripoff!DVD Purchase: No way, Jose!Rental: I wasted my time.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
159,Derek237,Just skip this one and go directly to part 3,3,1 August 2003,"Well, what can I say? This is a terrible sequel and very clearly the worst of the elm street series. The acting is bad (even for a horror movie), the scares are cheap, and it's just plain boring. My main reason for hating this movie so much is that they broke Freddy rule #1: no one dies in their sleep. If nobody dies in their sleep, where's the fun in watching a Freddy movie? There are people who can forgive this but I just can't.There are arguments in defense in this movie like, at least Freddy is still dark and scary instead of being a joker like in some of the other movies. I guess I sort of agree with that, and yes, the scenes with Freddy are good. But when Freddy isn't on the screen it's dull. All of the other films at least had interesting scenes/plot lines without Freddy and characters you could actually root for. This one does not. At all. It misses that backbone, and that's why this movie ultimately suffers.So seriously, if you aren't a Freddy fanatic and could stand missing some of the incoherent entries in the series, by all means skip this one and go directly to part 3. You won't miss anything at all since part 3 picks up where the first left off. Freddy's Revenge stands on its own anyway, since it seems like a completely different movie!My Rating: 1/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

161,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,4,18 April 2016,"The main problem with Elm Street 2 is that it isn't really an Elm Street movie. The plot has a teenager called Jesse who is being terrorised by Kruger in his dreams. So far so good. Jessie begins to feel more isolated from the people around him as none of them understand his situation. Fascinating. Then Kruger ends up possessing Jesse and uses him to slash teens at pool parties and whip away at naked PE teachers in the showers. Huh? What? That's not how Kruger operates. That's some evil-twin Patrick Swayze Ghost stuff going on there. Plus it completely deviates from the rules about what Freddy can and can't do. Ah well, at least Freddy's Revenge had the guts to be different. The gay overtones and subtexts annoyingly take centre stage in this film. It's less of horror movie about a nightmare boogie man and more of a drama about a teen coming to terms with his sexuality. Surely different material could have been used as a springboard for such a story? Whatever Freddy's Revenge did, Dr Jekyll and Mister Hyde did it better.Best Scene: I guess the bus ride in the opening was worth watching. Plus it was a chance to see Robert Englund without three layers of latex smacked on his face.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
162,jcslawyer,We all know it's the worst of the bunch,5,9 February 2020,"Look, there's no doubt this movie sucks. It came out at a time when sequels were rampant. This unfortunate installment was definitely trying to cash in on the first film's success. The problem is that it just stinks up the room. Some may argue 6 is the worst too, but at least it has somewhat of a connection to the series...not just a house.I remember renting this video when I was a kid. I thought it was weird how unrelated the movies were (even though it was a sequel) and how the atmosphere and premise were completely different. Don't get me wrong I don't mind different...but I do mind when it sucks. I didn't even feel like Robert England had any real interest or fun doing this.The only connections to the first film are the house where Jesse's family moves is Nancy's house from the first, Freddy, and the name. I don't really know who he's getting revenge on specifically in this one (in spite of the name) because his whole existence is built on revenge.The story is stupid. Nothing special or really much to it. They tried to be clever and take Freddy's dream ability further by allowing him to inhabit Jesse to kill in the real world. Really lame. The whole reason the first was awesome was because the idea of being killed in dreams is terrifying. This waters that down. Yawn.I can say that although the atmosphere was nowhere near as chilling as the first, the dreamlike quality was effective at creating an air of discomfort. It had very creepy moments and a couple good scares. It's not the worst movie ever made and it's not boring. But that doesn't make it much less of a suckfest either.If you want to watch the series you can definitely skip this and not feel like you missed out. It doesn't belong. However if you're a true horror aficionado, you should watch just to say you did. I will every now and then for nostalgia. But that's pretty much it.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

164,dudedazzreviews,Truly a nightmare to watch!,2,6 October 2010,"So after watching the very scary A Nightmare on Elm Street, it was time to watch the sequel but did the sequel live up to the first? The story is mediocre and pretty much goes over old ground but this time, Freddy wants to take over the main character's mind, soul and body so he can kill again. The characters are also mediocre, Freddy is the interesting character in the movie and Lisa, Jesse's girlfriend, is mildly interesting but unfortunately I can't say the same for our main character Jesse who is about as interesting as watching a brick wall for six hours. The movie lacked character development and it lacked depth in any of the characters and you weren't interested in any of them. The direction wasn't bad but the writing for the story and the teenagers was. It's basically a repeat of the first Nightmare but with uninteresting characters, no imagination and mediocre acting (except for, of course, Robert Englund as Freddy).A disastrous sequel to one of the greatest horror movies ever. I'm quite surprised Freddy didn't die out because of this sequel, as it's practically a nightmare to watch from start to finish. This isn't the same quality as the first movie and it isn't entertaining enough either. The film started out promising and starts out as a good continuation from the first Nightmare but, as time passed, it started to get worse along with the acting and started to repeat the first movie. In the end, it felt like it drifted from the Nightmare series with the only connection being the story of Freddy Krueger and Nancy's diary from the first Nightmare. Overall, it's a very disappointing sequel to a fantastic horror movie.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
165,legendaryunderdog,Interesting Sequel...depending on who you are that is!,8,2 July 2007,"I love the original Nightmare on Elm Street like everyone else does but I also liked 'Freddy's Revenge' just as much. Many critics give it a horrible rating for it straying too far from the original ideas of Craven and Co. But wait a second.... Freddy is attempting this time to take over a young teenagers body and therefore become 'human' and no longer just a figment of perception, so far the idea is captivating to me. I think what did it for me in this movie was the fact that before this movie, Freddy could only come to you in your dreams and that was it. Freddy doesn't really have much breathing room as far as his capabilities go at this point but now (Part 2) he can get into a body and become real! Just the thought of this madman coming into the real world and wreaking havoc is scary enough for anyone that could realistically perceive this. Yes there were some 'pseudo-gay' references in some scenes which could have been handled differently (director Jack Sholder to this date still denies any intentional use of homo-erotic references). And when we were all teenagers we all had those teenage-sexual confused period/phases in our lives and maybe these references in the movie were only done to better capture whats going on in the mind of the life of a male teenager in Springwood, Ohio in 1985. I may be wrong but all in all I thought this movie was very good , and regardless of what other critics think..I will proudly give this movie eight out of ten stars.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

167,jcaraway3,A different (but still lousy) approach,3,24 January 2014,"The first one had a teenage girl in a life or death struggle against a horrifying monster who only exists in her dreams and the dreams of her friends, who are quickly dying around her. This one? This is the one where a guy in his underpants sits around in a hot room and sweats for half the movie.We hop from the greatest in the series directly to the worst, with this ,the first of many inferior sequels to the original classic. The filmmakers go for sort of a ""Wolf Man"" approach, in which our hero, played by Mark Patton, is possessed and eventually transformed into the dream stalking Freddy Krueger. While this movie deserves props for originality , the plot makes little sense. I guess Freddy wants to take over the body of Jesse so he can be free to kill people in real life and in the dream world. The problem is, most of the suspense and fear of falling asleep from the first film vanish when most of the deaths occur outside the dream world. And the death scenes that are there are among the worst in the entire series. A couch being towel whipped to death? Really? A bunch of people being chased by Freddy at a pool party? Who thought that was a good idea? The plot structures of the many sequels, while formulaic, work because of the constant fear that a madman will get you in your sleep. This one has none of that.Jesse's transformation scene and the death of Grady do include some great visuals, as well as the hell dogs at the end of the film, but all of the ""Nightmare"" movies have good visuals, and this one doesn't really stand out too much. And the performances? Ouch. This was after Freddy was ghoulish and scary, but before he became a tongue in cheek pop icon, so he's kind of just ""there"" in this one. He has a couple of one liners, but there's nothing too humorous or creepy here. Mark Patton is prissy, obnoxious, and screams like an 8 year old girl. Kim Myers is cold, and looks very bored in her role as Lisa. Clu Gulager is one of my favorite actors, but he doesn't have too much to do here. And as far as the ""gay subtext"" is concerned, it's great they tried to give this film a little depth, but this doesn't help it out at all as a horror film. In fact, with the audience constantly looking for ""gay stuff"" throughout the film, any possibility of it being taken seriously is vanquished. So, all in all, this is the film equivalent of a hotdog which has been sitting directly under the hot sun in a parking lot in New Jersey for the past week. It's ugly, nauseating, and you couldn't get me to look at it again if you paid me to.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
168,Colbridge,Made by people who didn't understand or appreciate the ideas of Craven's original,4,13 November 2021,"New Line Cinema saw the potential in a sequel to Wes Craven's original A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and probably took their cue from the success of the Friday the 13th sequels being released every year by Paramount. They had a similar serial killer character on their hands that audiences latched onto and, still being a small company with little money, the rush to cash in on a sequel was inevitable.Wes Craven was asked by producer Robert Shaye to make the sequel but he hated the script so Shaye's friend Jack Sholder, who had success with Alone in the Dark (1982), came in to direct but he makes the big mistake of ignoring the rules Craven had set in the original, so instead of Freddy Krueger terrorising his victims in their dreams here he becomes a physical presence in the real world after possessing a young man, bursting out of his stomach and running around chasing teenagers at a pool party. There's not a lot of imagination going on here and it just doesn't work.The one thing that does work however, and has for all the sequels that followed, is Robert Englund's excellent performance as Freddy Krueger which he plays with gusto, vigor and style, no matter how bad the script is at the time. He is the best thing about the movie because Mark Patton the male lead doesn't have the charisma or acting skills to carry it. In fact most of the cast are quite bland which doesn't help an already bland script. There is so much possibility for creative ideas when you place a character in a dream-like setting but the script opts for a more straight forward killer stalking victims scenario instead. There are one or two inspired moments of horror that look quite creepy but without Craven's guiding hand it falls into cliche.The film has since gained cult status in the gay community for its homoerotic subtext which seems to run throughout. Patton, who plays Jesse, was gay in real life but his character is never overtly shown to be gay, in fact according to Sholder there was no intent or self awareness to create this subtext and it just happened organically, although screenwriter David Haskin has since admitted he did include it in the script thinking it would make things interesting and give it an edge.On the whole Freddy's Revenge falls well short of expectation and is made by people who didn't understand or appreciate the concepts and ideas of Craven's original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

172,mf2812,So underrated,10,16 September 2020,"I don't get all the hate for this movie. Unless you have a problem with the co-lead actor being gay then there's nothing else that can be said. It does have a strong female heroine and all the characters are likeable. According to Wes Craven he wasn't happy about the scenes where Freddy is in full view in the real world, not the dream but I hardly think that detracts from what is unquestionably the darkest NOES of the whole series. Freddy has no quips and never spouts some cheesy comedic lines. Throughout the movie there is little segments of Jesse at or just turning up to school but within minutes it's back to nighttime and the dreams start again. Incidentally Craven (who I love btw) used the same basic premise as this in New Nightmare of Freddy appearing in the real world and used the brilliantly delivered line ""You are all my children now"" as well. The acting's good, it's entertaining and Freddy looks the evilest he ever managed in any of the others (due to the contact lenses which suit the character so well).In conclusion, I think this movie is unfairly dismissed because of its gay undertones but that was such a clever idea on so many levels as at that time it was still a bit hoodoo. I rated this a 10, which it's not. But it's a solid 7 so I've overrated to try and balance some of the poor ratings given from obvious homophobes. I'm not in the slightest trying to say that everyone who didn't like it was because of that issues, but even those reviewers have to admit that a lot are due to homophobia.Anyway. If you've not seen it, it's well worth a watch. Don't judge by ratings alone and have a watch yourself. You may be surprised.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
173,WrathChld,a new approach,5,3 July 2006,"It is not an easy task to follow up a masterpiece like the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". This time the approach is to use the new kid on the block as a puppet for Freddy's killings. The new kid, controlled by Freddy, does most of the killings. The movie, in my opinion, is not even on the same level as the original. It is a poor attempt to follow up a masterpiece. It was pretty cheesy in many cases, but it still has some cool looking kill scenes. This is not the best of what the Elm Street series can bring to the viewer, but it does help piece the story for the fan. Sweet Dreams!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
174,G.Spider,"Not the worst, but not the best either.",6,14 June 1999,"The opening scenes of this film are very promising.  The title music has a very sinister, menacingly calm quality to it and there is an excellently nightmarish sequence in a school bus which is driven by Freddy.But generally the film is a might-have-been.  True, it has its moments, such as the discovery of Nancy's diary and the scene at the party, but things are pretty tame compared to the first film.  Jesse is the new teenager living in Nancy's old house and haunted by nightmares, but apart from the opening sequence there are very few dreamlike effects.  There are some nightmarish animals but they are too briefly seen and are in such total darkness that they're barely visible.  The film is more of a cliched haunted house yarn than a story about nightmares.  There are some interesting homosexual undertones but they are never really developed properly.  There are also gaping plot-holes.  After Freddy tears his way out of Jesse's body, the remains somehow return to life.  The next time Freddy appears Jesse seems to be inside him.  Can anyone work out what's going on?What really lets this film down is its weak ending.  Freddy and his boiler room suddenly burst into flames because Jesse's girlfriend tells him she loves him.

But now, a new kid on Elm Street is being haunted by every night by gruesome visions of the deadly dream stalker. And if his twisted soul takes possession of the boy's body. Freddy will return from the dead to wreak bloody murder and mayhem upon the entire town.This film starred: Robert Englund, Mark Patton & Kim Meyers A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET PART 2:FREDDY'S REVENGE used to be my most hated film ever however I have watched it again and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was but it still was poor basically the new boy Jesse moves into the house which was owned by Nancy and her mother in the first film, this film tells you that Nancy went insane and her mother killed herself. However Freddy wants more than to just killing people in their dreams so he tries to take possession of Jesse to continue his massacre in the real world.The film is poor and nowhere near the standards of the original, however I suppose you have to watch it if you want to watch them from the beginning however I do warn you, this film is not a great one but I will say this it is better than NEW NIGHTMARE which was released in 1994/1995 because that my friends was absolutely dreadful.**/***** Poor",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The first one is a classic, I admire the imagination of it but I still preferred the remake, it was gritty, disturbing and gory, just like these films should be. Come on, he's a child murderer who comes back and kills you in your dreams. Back in it's day the first one and second must have been terrifying but they have not aged well AT ALL. After watching this I feel like no one in the 80s could act, except Robert England, he's always good. But both the lead roles where utter garbage, the actors don't even have the charisma of a hat between them. I admire that it's a classic and so 80s, But there was no story or life like acting.

It doesn't always work, but there are some great visuals and solid performances and Freddy's never looked scarier. I'm not sure what they did with his makeup and/or the lighting in this one, but he's really scary and cruel. You forget how menacing he could be in the first two movies after decades of him being a violent stand up comic.

181,theterminator-92378,A disappointing follow up in the nightmare franchise,3,1 October 2017,The original Nightmare on Elm street movie was iconic and so we were expecting big things from the follow up movie but unfortunately we were given a movie that really was a rehash of the first one and the only new thing that we got was Freddy possessing our main lead but besides that we weren't given something inventive. Robert Englund is Freddy and continues to terrify us and Mark Patton is our lead boy Jesse who moves into Nancy's old house but really doesn't realize the hell he's walked into and overall he was an interesting character to get behind and i was sad to root against Freddy . Kim Myers is Lisa who is Jesse's love interest and someone who will help in the fight against the man of the dreams she was yet again another person who i enjoyed seeing go toe to toe with our bad guy. I have to say that Freddy's revenge compared to other films in the series it doesn't do well at giving us Freddy and making us purely terrified of our villain but still there are still good moments which redeemed it from being called an overall train wreck.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The story continues 5 years after the elm street murders when nancy had her final confrontation with freddy krueger , nancy ran away after casting him out but the demon continued to dwell in her old house that hasnt been lived in since the murders until a dysfunctional family move into the house where freddy takes control of the familys vulnerable teenager jesse who unwillingly participates in a new murder spree, with englund playing a more evil and menacing krueger this time around , he manages to steal the show in the little scenes hes in , everything else in the movie has a B grade feel accept for a superb performance from robert englund , mark patton who plays jesse is just annoying and cringe worthy including gay innuendoes pointing at his character along with his girlfriend lisa (kim myers who works well with the material shes been given.

It's still good to watch from time to time though. The characters are developed right and Freddy is shown an equally amount of good times throughout it, but there is still something missing to make it a true Nightmare movie.MINOR SPOILER:The only thing I did not like about this movie is this is when the series started to take a fantasy twist.

Its not a bad film, it has good ideas, I just think the execution could have been done much better.Jesse is the first problem here, he just ain't Nancy. He was meant to different and I understand that having your dreams invaded by Freddy and being possessed by him are two totally different things, but the character is just boring and his annoying girly shrieks don't make it any better. However I do love the idea of Freddy needing to possess someone to get strong again.Freddy is different here as well, no longer the sneaking in the shadows type, instead he's just plain sneaky. He uses Jesse to get the kids afraid again and then, well he kills kids, in full view of everyone he just plain kills them. I like this kind of Freddy, balls to the wall fearless in his killing, I do prefer the more inconspicuous, shadow Freddy however.Overall, Good ideas here but the execution wasn't right, it didn't feel right and so the film suffered.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The idea of letting Freddy possess a human body, so he can kill again, is a highly original idea in the Freddy-universe, it is just not intriguing. In the film, Freddy says to Jesse: ""You've got the body, and I've got the brain"". Well, clearly nobody was having the brain during shooting. By the way, can you imagine a more 80'ish title than ""Freddy's Revenge""?It is clearly a fast production movie with a smaller budget.

192,crowes-18865,I Will Always Defend This Entry,8,28 February 2020,"I was not a hater of this one even when it was originally released. I was ten when the first one came out so I missed getting in on it at that time. The first Nightmare I watched was 3 and so unfortunately I started with the movie that moved the whole franchise into the realm of comedy. I am not saying I don't like the sequels. I love 3 and 4 and still like 5 as well as New Nightmare but I did watch out of order in that I went from 3 to 1 to 2 and then started at 4 and went in order as they came out. Freddy's Revenge may be a step down from the original but I have great respect for their courage to break the cookie cutter formula and try to do something different. It does have its flaws but it gets the feel of the few dream sequences right as the first one did, still uses practical effects rather than CGI, makes great use of music and boasts a really creepy atmosphere throughout. I can't review it without addressing the homoerotic side of it. Yes, it is there but to be honest for all of us who remember those teenage years we can surely understand how grappling with confusion such as Jesse's during those years would add tension, awkwardness and fear to a time in our lives when those things were already at a high. Add to that a supernatural killer trying to possess you because your family chose the wrong house to move into and it makes for a great formula for a horror. Jesse may not be the best character in the franchise but Mark Patton sure gave it everything he had to make this a memorable character. There are some logic issues with parts of the story as it relates to the first movie but overall this is a dark, scary Freddy movie. I have always liked it but Freddy's Dead and the Nightmare reboot in my opinion elevated it even more. It deserves retroactive credit and deserves to be judged using a whole new set of criteria today.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

True, it has some good, memorable scenes, such as SPOILERthe nightmare with the bus and the famous remark: ""You are all my children now""SPOILER but I think that it is overall a dull film with too nasty scenes and unlikable characters. The idea of possessing was good, but it wasn't made very well. The moments, in which Freddy appeared were too similar with thats in part 1, but not as powerful.

196,Parks,Freddy's Revenge of the Nerd,3,2 June 2010,"What a bizarre bit of horror fluff from the 80's.Having seen none of the Elm Street sequels, I wasn't really sure what to expect here. What I got was a weird dance routine to Harold Faltermeyer style music, exploding parakeets, dogs with human faces, evil puppet pussycats and probably the most ridiculous horror lead ever in ""Jesse"". Another review I read described him as ""an irritating twerp"" which I have to admit is pretty much on the nose.Jesse is a teenage boy from the 80's with big hair and a bigger problem. His family have moved into the house from the first movie and he's started having nightmares about Freddy. This puts a bit of a crimp in his social life, especially when he starts shrieking like a five year old girl during class, and being forced by Freddy to go to S&M bars at night.Speaking of which, a number of the reviews I've read for this film mention the gay subtext. I'm not sure if it is intentional or not. On the one hand, it is pretty blatant. On the other, to assume it is intentional is to assume that some form of intelligence is behind the script. The jury in my head is still out on this.Back to the film. It soon becomes clear (because Jesse keeps whining on about it) that Freddy wants to possess him in order to carry his murders over to the real world. No-one believes Jesse. ""Why won't anyone beleeeeeeive me?"" he complains to his girlfriend while covered in the blood of his best friend. Eventually, she catches on.There's a bit of a denouement at the end (the traditional place for it) which is rather limp but does involve the girlfriend with big 80's hair and a bow. I am told the 80's are coming back, which is hardly surprising considering it is the best decade ever. Let's just hope they remake this sequel too. The exploding parakeet will be awesome in 3D.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

It is typical 80s schlock, the only real redeeming quality to the movie is Freddy, he maintains a dark aura about him in this movie(still not as good as the first). The acting from the other lead actors was horrible, and the ending was laughable rather than suspenseful. I noticed this seemed to be a trend with the Nightmare films, as the first one also had a disappointing ending. There are worse movies than this and it is fun to watch just to waste time, or if your a fan of the series, just don't expect any scares or suspense here.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

200,solidgameboy12-1,Rereview: A Nightmare on Elm Street 2,7,11 July 2004,"I reviewed this movie in 2004, which meant I was 14 years old and thought most everything was very good, so I have decided to come back and re-review this movie to give my response on the whole picture, more mature and more than willing to judge appropriately on this film.NOES 2: Freddy's Revenge is the sequel to Wes Craven's classic movie about the killer who murdered a select set of teenagers in their dreams. This movie claims that everything that happened from the first movie was five years ago. A new family has moved into the house that was originally owned by the main character from the previous film. A young man, Jesse dreams about the ""Dreamy"" killer, Freddy Krueger, with no true explanation as to why.Through Jesse's dreams, the villain comes to him, asking Jesse to ""Kill For Me... You've got the body, I've got the brains..."" The movie becomes a young man's self realization that he's not the monster, or perhaps he is.This movie is often considered by most fans and reviewers to be the absolute worst of the series, and for a long time after the initial viewing, I would have had to agree. The movie approaches a subject that is quite different from anything typically viewed of horror films from the 80s or the modern time: Homosexuality. Most of the time, gay guys in movies are the new black guy cliché: If they are in a movie, they will die first.The movie doesn't even approach homosexuality by that context, but by using a rather confused boy, questioning if he's supposed to be a killer or a normal teenager in a convincing way that sort of brings a great psychological approach on the whole villain spin, and it is mostly effective.However, the movie is nowhere free of flaws like the original. From what I have heard and read from the original writer, he meant for the movie to be about a kid trying to find himself, coming out of the closet in association with the villain taking over this kid. That stuff is implied, but it works. But having Jesse dancing in his room flamboyantly or going to a gay bar reduces any message of acceptance in favor of making people call out the phrase ""Gay"" in description of this movie.Another problem is that the movie has its fair share of inappropriate shots and scenes that serve little sense to advance the plot. Killer animals and dumb teenagers at a pool party are the major offenders and definitely amps the movie's camp factor.But even with all that said, I feel like I can support this movie a little bit more than before. It's not the best, but it works with what it had. The film score has absolutely no association with the original movies, and makes the movie scarier, I think. The makeup and horror effects are downright terrifying, and certainly the makeup effects on Freddy Krueger are top notch.It is very difficult to accept a movie that is often the nadir of the whole series, but after reviewing it, I can say I support the movie series and its lowest ranked film a little bit easier than previously said. If the film had some shots and cuts here and there to make the movie flow easier, perhaps it could have been better than the predecessor.7 out of 10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
201,thetheonly,I still don't know how to feel...,5,17 October 2019,"This film is definitely the most different of the series. I mean first with the undertones and secondly with how Freddy decides to go after teens. I'm going to skip a synopsis since other people have done that plenty of times before but instead go over where this film succeeds and fails. First Freddy is still somewhat scary in this film and not goofy yet and in my opinion it is the best looking make up for Freddy of this series. Next the film has some very progressive undertones as in coming out and homosexuality, despite being disputed by the creators. Next I liked the atmosphere which was solid throughout. Finally the acting was decent overall but not super above average. Also the kills are still somewhat creative and there's some interesting body horror in it. The film does fail at a few things despite some creative kills there are definitely some that are just filler. Next the dream sequences are some of the weakest of the series. I also feel like the direction of Freddy taking over bodies in this film was a horrible one off idea, which thankfully was only in this film, unless you count Freddy possessing the stoner in Freddy V Jason, which was also bad in that film. Finally the film feels confused with where it wants to go, but luckily that problem doesn't arise again in the series until later in the films. Overall you should see it, especially of you're a completist or can find it for cheap, which is easy and it's included in a few different Nightmare box sets.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
202,forrestwrs,All Really Pointless,2,12 September 2010,"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 discards everything that made the first Nightmare movie so good.First of all, this movie lacks the great script that made the first one so enjoyable. The dialogue straight up sucks here. None of the lines really go together and everything is kind of bulled together. I also don't like what they did with the premise. They completely abandoned it. The whole idea behind the first movie was that it was about a killer who murdered people through their dreams. Here, he comes to life through a boy and kills people? I'm not sure why or how that works. It's never explained to us and there's not much to go by. Something else that is never explained to us is how Freddy got his heat powers in this movie. He can make room temperatures sky rocket and controls the temperatures of fences and pool water to make them hotter than the air around it. I couldn't figure out how this power worked or why he suddenly had it.And these characters are all really pointless. Not even pointless; I don't get why they like each other. The lead male, Jesse, becomes friends with a guy who was a jerk to him during the first half of the movie, Grady, seemingly overnight. Again, it's not really explained why they're suddenly friends. They sort of just are.I also didn't like the way no one ever made a big deal about people getting killed off. One teacher gets killed and that seems to be a big deal, but later when a couple of teenagers get killed, no one really mentions it afterward.***Warning: Here There Be Spoilers*** The ending is where a lot of problems with this movie lie as well. I hated the ending from the original film--straight up hated the ending--and this one was pretty much a carbon copy of that. But besides that, no one really talks about stuff like, what happened to all the kids who were murdered at Lisa's party? Did the cops think it was weird that there was no suspect present? Does everyone know about Freddy now? Does anyone care about all the kids who just died? Why is Jesse taking the school bus now? What happened to his car? Did Freddy really die because the power of love was too much for him? ***For these reasons and still others--including weak direction, cheesy special effects, awful logic, terrible acting, and some hideous makeup--A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 does not set me up well for the five or so sequels that are to follow...2/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
203,HOPSQUIAT,I have mixed feelings about it.,5,11 October 2020,"Its not a terrible movie. It is very well made and well acted. However, the movie feels like it was trying to reboot the first movie. Freddy's mythology, powers, and even the rules of the dream world all seems different in this movie. It doesn't really feel like a sequel. Freddy leaving the dream world and trying to get in someone's body? Really? Its so not like him....It feels more like a spin-off of the Nightmare on Elmstreet series in all honesty. When you watch the movies together, it doesn't fit at all. It isn't even really mentioned in the other movies. Its like it never happened.If you watch the movie as it own movie about a boy who is struggling with his sexuality, its a pretty good movie. As a Nightmare movie, it just doesn't work.Still check it out if you are a horror fan, there are some really cool set pieces. Maybe not the bird scene or the pool party scene, but when Freddy goes through the guy's body, its pretty cool.I hope that helps.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

I did like Lisa(Jesse's girlfriend) trying to help Jesse get over the nightmare's and the deaths surrounding him but the whole movie was just bad. If I were anyone reading this review I suggest skipping the movie and watch the Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors because this movie has nothing to do with Nancy and Freddy battles or anything other than stalking a teenage boy struggling in Gym class and his life at Nancy's former home with his family who thinks that he is doing drugs or drinking alcohol.

There's less suspense than the first one, its almost non existent but still this is a godd movie, if you wanna see a bad movie watch Mortal Kombat Annihilation, that was bad!

208,grkamerican1984,awful sequel to an awesome movie,1,4 November 2007,"this movie was on youtube a few months ago. i swear this movie was probably the worst sequel ever, next to Friday the 13th Part 7 and 8. the acting was pretty awful. Robert englund was the only thing that kept this movie going. but there were some points in the film where he just disappeared and we got to see the weird days in the life of Jesse . that scene with the bird going crazy was kind of cool, but the dad's explanations and theories about the bird were just unbelievably stupid. the worst thing about this film was probably it's plot. even though this movie has the highest body count in the series, the movie's plot is so dumb! this movie is about Freddy, so we wanna see FREDDY kill people, not some weirdo kid who's sometimes Freddy and sometimes himself or some stuff like that. i think a really dumb scene was during the pool party. after Freddy destroyed half of the backyard and killed about six people, everything and everyone turns quiet, and some dumba** kid walks up and says to Freddy ""it's alright, no one's gonna hurt you."" this guy quickly gets the fate every dumb-a** teen in a horror flick deserves. when the words 'no one's gonna hurt you"" were spit out, i was convinced that this teen would break out into singing ""kumbaya"" to Freddy and giving him a hug. speaking of stupid and weird characters, WHAT THE HECK was up with that gym teacher?! it's like he wanted to abduct Jesse or something, like some weird child predator. now we move onto Jesse again. No matter what happens, Jesse never has a reaction that looks like what it's supposed to be. when he's angry, he looks like he just sh** himself. when he's scared, he's calm at first and then just screams out of nowhere. the only things that make this movie watchable are Robert englund (freddy) Christopher young (music) and Kevin yagher (special effects)Overall; this movie was really bad, and i don't recommend it to any fans of 80s horror flicks at all. how this movie managed to be the #1 horror film of 1985, i'll never know. if you wanna see a good Nightmare movie, watch 1,3,4,New Nightmare, and FVJ. Stay away from 2,5 and 6. that is all.2/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
209,HorrorFreak1997,very big step down from the original but still a good movie!,7,5 October 2013,"Freddy's revenge is a good movie. don't let all the bad reviews cloud your judgment. while i will admit, it is a BIG step down from the masterpiece that is the original but it is still a good movie with a few flaws. first of all the direction they took the story was a strange one. the writers chose to abandon the whole dream demon idea (which in my opinion it wasn't necessarily a bad decision because of how early in the franchise it was. but it also wasn't a good decision either because id much prefer the dream demon premise) and have Freddy trying to possess a kid named Jesse's body to kill in the real world again. Robert Englund brings another terrifying performance to the screen as Freddy Krueger. remember folks.. Freddy is still scary in this one, and the pool party massacre scene is fun to watch! the atmosphere is very dark but loses so much of it's power due to the absence of the dream sequences and all the possibilities that could have been utilized. in the FX department the film does alright. now something else i should include in the review is the obvious homosexual aspects included in the film. i am not gay (so this is not biased), but i can honestly say it adds a uniqueness to the film. in the fist film Nancy's secondary struggle was her parent's separation and her mother's alcoholism, in this film Jesse's secondary struggle is his own sexuality. as i said this doesn't ruin the film what so ever. it simply adds a uniqueness to the film. there are definitely some flaws with this film though. Mark Patton leaves a little something to be desired here with his performance in the lead role. there is no doubt he suites the role it's just the fact that he reeks of inexperience. there are also a few scenes that are very misplaced and strange to say the least. but for me i choose to either ignore or overlook them in favour of all of the positives here. we get a great performance from Robert englund, some good atmosphere and genuine scares, good FX, and a unique and strange experience. check this one out its a fun little film that deserves more respect than it gets. 7.3/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

213,connorbbalboa,What a disappointing sequel.,7,27 August 2017,"After the late Wes Craven's 1984 horror masterpiece, A Nightmare on Elm Street, was a box-office success, the studio New Line Cinema wanted a make a sequel quickly. Craven was asked back, but refused, a good part of it being due to financial differences with the studio. So the directing job went went to Jack Sholder, who had previously worked on Alone in the Dark (1982). Sholder admitted that he disliked the original film, despite respecting it. A lot of that disdain is clear throughout the movie, which is probably the biggest disappointment of the series. The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead are worse, but they did not have that much riding on them as this film did.The story opens with the only scary scene in the movie, where a bus dropping off high school children suddenly goes crazy and drives out into the desert. The ground falls around it until it is in a see-saw-like position. The driver reveals himself as Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), who proceeds to go after the kids. Just before he strikes with his razor-blade glove, it cuts to a normal family having breakfast and we hear the main protagonist, Jesse (Mark Patton) waking up from a nightmare and screaming like a little girl. The rest of what follows is some typical high school jazz, except when Freddy Krueger appears, which is hardly at all, and everything in Jesse's house (owned by Nancy Thompson's (Heather Langenkamp) family from the original) heats up like crazy. And yet, Jesse's father says that everything is fine, even when a parakeet goes crazy. The opening is only a warm-up for the viewer to get to know one of the weakest protagonists I've seen not just in a horror film, but a film in general.Jesse is what one would think of when it comes to awkward high school boys, but what makes him so weak is how he reacts to what happens to him in the film. Freddy wants to take control of Jesse so that he can eventually kill people in the real world, where he will have unlimited power. Even after Freddy starts coming to him, he does nothing to figure out what's happening. Even after his gym coach, Schneider (Marshall Bell), gets killed by a possessed Jesse, Jesse does not drink coffee or take pills to keep himself awake right away, or let his girlfriend, Lisa (Kim Myers) help him out. It's almost like he's eager to let Freddy take control of his body without even realizing it.The reason Jesse looks so awkward in this movie is that Mark Patton cannot act for peanuts here. Apparently, the director's or somebody's idea for Jesse acting scared or intimidated was to have his body shake a lot, always look like he wants to be somewhere else, and do it badly. Myers does a better job, but at the end of the film when she has to face off against Freddy, who finally does take full control of Jesse, she gets all unnecessarily weepy to the point of extreme annoyance and takes away from how horrific Freddy looks when he melts. It's all part of a confusing finale where Freddy is somehow defeated with the power of love when Lisa kisses him. It does not have the same logic to it as how Freddy is defeated in the first film. Listen to me, talking about logic in movies about dreams. It's also part of the film's attempt to be even more serious and scary than the original, like Lisa and Jesse's relationship was a love story that couldn't be topped. Appreciate the effort, Jack Sholder, but no thanks.The film has very few scares other than the opening scene. The one that comes closest is when Jesse stays at his friend Ron Grady's (Robert Rusler, who also struggles to act) place for the night and Freddy bursts out of his body (a great effect) to kill him. What ruins it is Ron screaming for his dad to open the door to his room (he's grounded), and his dad screaming the same thing. Which side has the lock? A couple of failed jump scares include a boa constrictor wrapping around Jesse as he sleeps and a mouse jumping out of an old locker in a factory that Jesse and Lisa visit (where Freddy used to take his child victims in his past life).In most film series, the first sequel is the best and the third is either a disappointment or just not as good. This time, it's the opposite. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is a perfect example of how a new series can lose track of itself so quickly. Having a weak protagonist especially hurts the film, partly because it's jarring to go from such an intelligent and sturdy character like Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) from the original to a weakling who can't solve a serious problem like this himself. It does not make him more relatable.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
214,sunshinebeachcinema,Bold themes running through this slasher sequel.,6,31 May 2014,"It's been a few years since Freddy Krueger first returned from the dead and began killing teenagers in their dreams. Then he was defeated by Nancy Thompson, who pulled him into the waking world for a final showdown. Now he's back for some revenge?Bizarrely, even though Freddy's motivation from the get-go has been revenge and all the other films in the series are specifically about Freddy's Revenge, this is the only one that isn't. Freddy usually targets the Elm Street children, the surviving children of the parents who first killed him, but here he pick on the new family has moved into Nancy's old house.Still, this is a very minor gripe, as this is the first sequel and the series could have gone in any direction at this point. What the film makers decided to do with this one ended up being unique, and has a lot more going for it than your average slasher sequel.Freddy's plan this time is to inhabit the body of his primary victim, Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) whose family has moved into the house. In his first face-to-face encounter with Jesse, Freddys says 'I've got the brains, and you've got the body.' Cue some classic Freddy body horror as he rips apart his skull to expose his brain.This means that Freddy spends more time breaking into the real world to kill people in the flesh than he does setting up the elaborate and ironic dream sequences that would come to define the rest of the series. He slowly takes over Jesse's body to achieve this, creating a more potent and personal journey than characters in other Nightmare films experience. This film is about Jesse's dilemma, and his feelings of confusion and isolation.Specifically, this is that Freddy's manipulation of his body represents a latent homosexuality, which Jesse is confused and terrified by, and as a result resists. He exhibits self-hatred, and is continually torn between whether his actions are the result of an uncontrollable possession, or something else inside himself.Certainly the openly gay actor Mark Patton and screenwriter David Chaskin have acknowledged these themes. Director Jack Sholder was apparently naïve to this, and unwittingly accentuated the subtext when surrendering to the movie's naturally camp aesthetic.There are many scenes in the film which suggest this, most significantly the death of Jesse's gym coach, who he runs into in a leather bar. The coach comes across as very predatory, forcing Jesse back to school to run laps. Jesse/Freddy's response to this is to strip ad whip the coach in the showers, before killing him with Freddy's glove.Not only is the main character in the film a male, but the only characters who die in this film are male. This is a significant reversal of the established slasher formula. The only major female character in the film is Jesse's girlfriend Lisa. They never consummate their relationship the way they might in a bawdier slasher movie, although it is their love for each other which eventually defeats Freddy.Another recurring motif is of heat, which could tie into the film's other theme to represent an increasing heat of sexuality. During some of the film's few dream sequences, Jesse experiences intense heat as objects in his room, such as vinyl records and candles, melt around him. The film is bookended by dreams where Freddy appears as a bus driver and drives Jesse's school bus through the desert and into what looks like hell.In the real world, the house's thermostat is broken, and the toaster bursts into flames. Finally, in a hilarious and surprising real world event, the family's lovebirds become crazed and cause chaos in the living room before exploding in a ball of flame.A highlight of the Nightmare on Elm Street series is its role as an '80s time capsule, more so than other slasher franchises, and this instalment is no exception. Notable moments include Jesse's room-cleaning montage wearing ridiculous sunglasses, and the pool party scene, in which Freddy appears to wreak havoc and terrorise the partygoers en masse. I also love Jesse's car, 'The Dinosaur,' a beaten-up convertible that he has to hotwire every time he wants to start it.In conclusion, there is something very complex running through this film. The fact that such feelings manifest themselves as Freddy and are ultimately destroyed could be seen to undermine this film's exploration of sexuality by suggesting it is something that is destructive and must be defeated. It could be that Freddy represents not overt homosexuality, but a general teenage confusion surrounding sexuality. Defeating Freddy therefore means Jesse has reconciled his confusion and acknowledged his feelings for Lisa.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

On the good side, the movie has great special effects, including many realistic gory deaths and some pretty cool paranormal attacks. The acting is actually pretty good, and so is the camera-work. But sadly, these things can't help but make you mad, just teasing you about how good this movie could have been if it had an even halfway decent script. I understand why Wes Craven had nothing to do with this. You just really can't have a good scary movie with such an awful script. So if you saw the first one and liked it, skip to part 3, part 2 has nothing to do with the others.

Its only too long before Freddy begins yet another reign of terror.The film gets off to a quick start with a nightmare which really takes you by surprise and is set up nicely and all i'll say is it goes down faster than the Titanic. Throughout the film you feel that it is just a mixture of plot lines just thrown together in the editing room without a thought to a normal narrative such as the first film.The film is hard to follow and strays heavily from the first film which is not the way a sequel should go but then again we are talking about the horror genre here. Freddy gets little to no screen time in the film which is really a bad thing considering most people watch these film for Freddy so i couldn't understand the logic in this but never the less they did it! The acting is poor and you really feel that Mark Patton was badly miscast in some way or another and i really never bought his whole descent in to Freddy's clutches which i did in the first film. Of course Robert Englund is superb (when he gets chance) as Freddy Kruger and really shows an evil side towards the end. The other actors really aren't worth a mention because of the total lack of respect for their characters shown by the director and writer of the film.Speaking of which Jack Sholder should be appalled by his work here, there is no real direction and when there is it really is all over the place and very bad and shows in no way the brilliance of what Wes Craven brought to the original. The writing too is just mind boggling in terms of how the guy even managed to get his trash on the screen in the first place, the dialogue is cheap and cheesy which is what we expect in the horror genre but just not to this bad extent.All in all this film will certainly go down as one of the worst horror sequels ever as far as i'm concerned but i did give this a four out of ten so there must be something worth watching.... well yes there is and i think its the fact that this is a nightmare on elm street film and for that reason you want to like it a lot but it just wasn't worth the bother and should be ignored from the franchise to be totally fair.As far as horror sequels go this is one of the worst i have witnessed in a long time and is in great distance from the original and that is a shame! **** out of **********",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
220,RebelXStar,You are all My Children now,5,21 November 2015,"Shortly after the Walsh family move into Nancy Thompson's old house on Elm Street, their eldest son Jesse begins to experience horrific nightmares. He frequently dreams that a man named Freddy Krueger is trying to possess his body in order to use him to commit his murders in the real world.When Jesse starts sleepwalking and finding himself waking up at the scenes of very real murders he believes he is losing his mind.With the support of his girlfriend Lisa and Nancy's old diary documenting her own struggles with Freddy, he investigates the sinister truth behind Freddy's history with Elm Street and tries to find a way to defeat him before he takes him over for good.I must admit I have no idea how to rate this movie. As a Nightmare on Elm Street movie, it kind of sucks. Like Part III of the Halloween movies, Freddy's Revenge is very much the black sheep of the Nightmare franchise, following almost none of 'rules' established in the rest of the series. During some parts of the movie, Jesse isn't even asleep when 'things' start happening to him, and at one point, in the form of Freddy, he unleashes an attack on a pool party in full view of a group of very wide awake teenagers.You could pretty much replace Freddy with a generic monster and not lose anything from the story.However if you look upon it as a standalone horror movie about a teenage boy struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, it is far more interesting.I've heard conflicting things about whether or not the homo erotic themes in Freddy's Revenge were intentional or not. Frankly, the gay undertones are far too blatant for them not to be intentional, so I don't buy that they weren't written into the movie on purpose. The choice to not only have a male protagonist in a genre where the protagonist is usually female but also to cast an openly gay actor (Mark Patton) to play him was quite an unusual (and I believe, deliberate) choice.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

II Freddy's revenge is a very poor follow up to the original classic Nightmare on Elm St. It feels overall extremely underwhelming considering it's only the second of the series and the story was still fresh following the success of the original the previous year. You would generally expect an effort like this much later in a series where the ideas are running dry and the studios are milking the franchise. This film seems entirely rushed and very stale with little to offer in suspense or horror for that matter. It is extremely anti-climactic and pointless. None of the characters are exactly likable and there is very little in the way of character development so one could care less which random character gets killed next.It simply does not live up to the original in any way shape or form, except for that Freddy looks and feels a lot more sinister in this film, and has a lot less dialogue. Then ending is extremely underwhelming and silly as well, staying true to the rest of the film I suppose. This might be the weakest of the original 7 part series.

It has quite an interesting concept and had a lot of excitement but never quite delivers the same thrill as other cult horrors like Friday the 13th, Re-Animator and Dawn of the Dead (Romero).The trailer for ""Freddy's Revenge"" builds you up for a Nightmare bumped up a notch, with more action, more energy and a lot more horror. However, it seems the trailer editors were experts of their profession, as the film lacked more than 5 minutes of screen madness.Where as the other films follow a string of murders climaxing with a battle between Freddy and his final victim, this film never quite reaches the fighting stage as Freddy seems to be in a war with himself.The main problem was the 'lack of things happening'. Freddy Kruger's method of murder and the man himself are the main attractions, which leaves you waiting for them to appear, disappointing when they do as you see a very limited amount Freddy and a small number of tame deaths, apart from the obvious money shot.If you liked the other films, this one's for you, but I wouldn't count on it going to the top of your favourite Nightmare on Elm Street movie list.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

FREDDY has to stay in dreams and loves it there, seen in further sequels. The acting is okay, seeming the movie dosen't know if it's hero is gay or a hidden homosexual.

228,TheMikeJustice,Should've been some other movie entirely,7,27 August 2014,"There's lots wrong with NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 — the whole, previously espoused-on ""gayness"" of it, and also how it manages to look and feel at least FIVE YEARS OLDER than the first one. It's seriously CARRIE meets SLEEPAWAY CAMP as far as the era depicted therein is concerned. That, plus it came on the heels of the hip, aggressive, and intelligent Wes Craven-directed original — so audiences were a little hard- pressed to get on board with some slow-ass, soft-focus ""Afterschool Special"" about a gay teen being menaced by a growly voiced bogeyman who may or may not be the hero's own repressed sexuality. Or something? I dunno.However, it's reasonably well-directed. I love the opening credits and some of that David Lynch-y boiler room action toward the end. The steadicam shot going up the stairs to the sister's room was pretty cool, too. Basically, I think it's like a really awesome TV movie. If it were some ABC Movie of the Week from 1978 that existed on its own, people would probably think it was pretty rad.

With weak acting, a lame script and pedestrian direction, there really aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe how awful this film is. It's a puerile exercise in teen exploitation that gleefully insults its intended audience with its rampant stupidity. ""Freddy's Revenge"" is an uneven, tedious, and sloppy sequel with plot holes, lapses in logic and horrible performances and one I don't intend to see again regardless of the kitsch and camp value. Don't bother turning onto this Elm Street - Freddy's nails are a little blunt here.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
230,anthonywltrs,Fantastic sequel and very underrated,9,16 March 2020,"Even when I watched this as a kid without noticing the Homosexual tones, I really enjoyed this movie as a whole. It really doesn't deserve all the hate it gets and while it is viewed is not a direct sequel, I believe it is. First off we have the main character, Jesse Walsh and his family move into the infamous 1428 Elm Street house just five years after Nancy and her family left. Jesse and his friend, Lisa, find Nancy's old diary that details her nightmare encounters with Freddy Krueger. This freaks Jesse out because he too had been having encounters with the dreaded dream demon. Plus there have been mentions of the events of the first film in this oneFreddy possessing Jesse to do his killing for him is very unique and something we haven't seen since then. It's obvious after his battle with Nancy and losing the power of fear, it left Freddy severely weakened and unable to continue killing teenagers in people's dreams, so instead he decides to inhabit's Jesse's body and slowly take ahold of both mind and spirit. This as well as Jesse's fear of Freddy forcing him to commit murder allows Freddy to grow stronger and able to kill in dreams again as seen from the third film on wards. Plus it's the last time ever that anyone moves in and lives within that house because when the Walsh family leave, it is always bordered up and within reasonIt also occurred to me that during the pool party where Freddy takes full control of Jesse's body, the teenagers weren't seeing Freddy at all, they were seeing Jesse commit murder and have no idea why other than being scared of course. That in itself is really cool because as 'we' are seeing Freddy killing the kids, it's through Jesse's eyes. Plus I do agree it's the last time Freddy was very dark within the franchise",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
231,Shaithis,The Start of Sequel-Mania.,6,11 January 2000,"You knew it had to happen.  A Nightmare on Elm Street could have went down in history as a great horror movie, but no, they had to rape the success of the first original concept and make sequel after sequel, practically making it as cheap as the Halloween and Friday the 13th films.  Of course some of the upcoming sequels (i.e. Dream Warriors) are really good, but why bother? Why not just make new and interesting horror films?  Not these cheap sequels that just carry on the story over and over again.  Or worse, just re-tells the exact same story, just changing minimal bits.That's what Freddy's Revenge, A Nightmare on Elm Street Part II does. Instead of getting nice Heather Langenkamp (Nancy in Part  I), we get Mark Patton as Jesse Walsh.  A nice enough guy sure.  But as the lead character? He couldn't hold the main role in this movie, perhaps if they got Johnny Depp back for this one it may have been better.  Even the actress Kim Myers as Lisa Webber doesn't get much sympathy for me.  At times in the film she did.  When she was worrying about Jesse in the beginning and didn't really understand this 'Freddy' character, I really liked her.  The film gets silly after that.  This film is does set one Freddy myth in motion though.  It is the fact that Freddy needs someone to bring him his victims.  A scene that has it's redeeming value is the bus scene.  Effects can't save this movie though as after watching it yet again I have the feeling that this was just one of those cheap direct to video releases.  What makes it worse is that it wasn't.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
232,Was-it-All-a-Dream,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985),7,8 May 2009,"The success of Nightmare on Elm Street paid for this film. Some people approached Nightmare 2 in development as just another movie. Others put a lot of work into it, and if you're looking, you can tell. And some others, I doubt the public will ever know what was going on inside their heads. For all the claims this sequel's subtext is strongly rooted in homoeroticism, which there is an equally strong argument in support of it, there's only one person who can substantiate these rumors - writer, David Chaskin. But no one seems to knows anything about him. This nearly gives Freddy's Revenge a whole other brand of cult status now- interpreting the meaning of the supposedly gay themes. I would personally love to pick the writer's brain about it as well. But with all the negative energy toward the film, it makes sense that we're never told what this film really means.Some say the film failed because it didn't have a female lead. At best, these claims are only an aesthetic preference. Fans couldn't have been disappointed by lack of a female lead. Kim Myers becomes the heroine in the last half hour. Even as a 'side-kick', she's in more scenes than Johnny Depp had in the original. The film does cast a male lead. A 20-year old baby-faced cutie (Mark Patton, who I certainly approve of, spending a few solid minutes of the movie in nothing more than tight white briefs). He's not your typical movie teenager, since he's only lacking the proper Cure / Flock of Seagulls / Echo & the Bunnymen goth '80s make up, dyed hair, and dark black clothing before turning into the average punk concert attendee. He has perpetual dark circles under his eyes, an intense look of introversion plastered on his face, and constant nervous mannerisms. But his isolation is what allows Freddy to exist, an ambitious re-working of the original's back story.I believe the homoerotic elements of the film are intended to take his incredible loner quality (which I always relate to) down an unknown path, somewhere unfamiliar to mainstream audiences. To lead him astray from his natural life patterns (this 'sort' of thing also happened in 1986's Labyrinth, only to a daydreaming girl) so that he would be vulnerable to Freddy taking him over. This of course was revisited three years later in 1988's The Dream Master, when Freddy used a spiritual connection of one character's dreams to catch teens for his victims. Here, he just uses the character's body. And we can never quite tell if he's in a dream or not. This leads to all sorts of fascinating set-ups which people just assumed meant Jesse was living out gay fantasies he was repressing. The first one has Jesse going to a leather or ""s&m"" bar. Though, a good 40% of the patrons aren't even wearing leather and few of whom are anyone in actual drag.The second has his Phys. Ed. coach blackmailing Jesse into entertaining him (I assume so he won't call Jesse's parents and tell them Jesse was hanging out in a gay / bisexual bar) in the gymnasium, then getting 'revenge' by whipping the coach naked with towels in the shower room while he's tied up. What stops this from being a fantasy of any kind, though, are several things. One- Freddy murders the coach, two- the coach fears for his life as inanimate objects take on a life of their own (a movie cliché I was obsessed with as a kid), three- Jesse could never be attracted to the coach anyway. He's played by Marshall Bell, king of the creepy 80's sleazeballs (remember him in 1988's Twins?). And even if the coach were played as more of a muscular, sexy, suave, mature older man and not such a creep - the movie sets him up as a classic pedophile.The third 'fantasy' is a lot more interesting. Jesse runs to his best guy friend, Ron (Robert Rusler, who you can also see shirtless in 1986's Vamp) sneaking into Ron's bedroom in the middle of the night to confess something and begs to sleep with him. Though just in the same room. Unfortunately they never share a bed together. What's great about this is that Jesse gets some guts and starts ordering another guy around, rather than letting someone like the coach walk all over him. And that he finally finds a healthy target for whatever affections he buries inside. Ron is a non-judgmental, open-minded, fun and funny guy who's never too serious (if anything, Jesse's the ultra-serious and uptight one) but is completely supportive in comforting his friend. Even if they never became intimate, Ron would take care of Jesse and help him get to a better place emotionally.Most people think of movies from the '80s as a technical step above the '70s (though now it looks a lot more dated by comparison). Not completely true in the scene at the old power plant. It's hampered by some horribly plastic creature effects (why'd they even bother with those 'demon dogs' anyway?). But the scene's lighting, camera-work, editing, and ensuing meltdown of Freddy's flesh (through stellar goo and dripping-gore effects), are outstanding. And Kim Myers' first-rate performance. The film is definitely underrated by some. Taken as a low budget film, it has a lot of great effective build-up scenes. An incredible camera pan up from the basement, up the stairs on 2 floors of the house, down hallways and all the way up to a bedroom in 1 shot - now, that's impressive! And other cool assorted imagery - Jesse's sister jumping rope in the middle of the night to the ""Freddy"" tune, the quirky ""Fu Man Fingers"" moment, and I thought this was really cool; a bolt of lightning striking inside the house while Jesse stands right in front of the window (a little Poltergeist inspiration?).",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
233,votesmall,Not half bad...... (Minor spoilers),6,11 August 2011,"I think the reason that everyone is so scared of the Nightmare series is because everyone has to sleep, and everyone has some kind of fear that Freddy Kruger can use against you. Dying in your dreams, then you die for real really appeals to me, and apparently, a ton of others.A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is often stated as the worst in the series. Which it probably is. I think a lot of this is that Englund only got thirteen minutes of screen time altogether, but it's still enjoyable. But is it perfect? No.But, let's sit back for a moment here. Is it really that bad? First of all, it's a Nightmare movie, where all of them are creative, disturbing, dark, comical, and just plain awesome. Second of all, this film has a few good one-liners from Freddy, like ""You are all my children now,"" and ""Daddy can't help you now!"" This movie is creative and introduces something new to the series, so why complain? I think a lot of viewers would have loved this movie if it was its own flick, and not associated with Kruger.Jesse moves into Nancy Thompson's infamous ""Elm Street House"" which has been vacant for years. He has a pretty girlfriend, but is having a tough time adjusting to the Springwood, Ohio school district. Soon, he begins having terrible nightmares, where his room knick nacks begin melting. So, he goes downstairs to turn off the furnace, only to discover that it isn't on. Suddenly, Freddy Kruger appears, and the fun begins. Freddy instructs him to ""kill for him"" and Jesse refuses. But soon, he discovers that Freddy is actually manipulating him to get revenge on the kids of Springwood, whose parents burned him alive.I think that Freddy's Revenge is cool because it really features Jesse agonizingly turning into Kruger, like knives coming out of his fingers, mood swings, and waking up, realizing that he was about to try and kill his little sister. I mean, wouldn't you be terrified knowing that a psychotic, undead child murderer was trying to force you to kill your friends and family and pin you? That is friggin' scary on its own. Jesse does a great job portraying the pain of the transformations and agonizingly trying to tell his family that he is possessed by a burned, undead, psychotic child murderer! We also get to learn quite a bit about Freddy's backstory, that he worked at a now abandoned power plant in the boiler room. This all leads to Jesse/Freddy attacking his best friend and arriving at his Girlfriend's pool party and attacking everyone, eventually leading to a shattering climax in the abandoned power plant.Many say that this movie has homosexual themes and granted star Mark Patton does spend much of the movie semi-naked, but the homo theme is a bit of a stretch. Robert Englund makes a fun and fairly gory return as Freddy Kruger, and we get to learn a bit , while the rest of the cast does decent performances. Freddy's Revenge is a great rainy day movie, with decent performances, a spectacular return of Freddy, some disturbing and freaky scenes, memorable one-liners, and a new plot. Is it the worst in the series? Probably. But that's only because it doesn't feature enough Freddy, though I think it worked well in this film.All around, a good sequel that critics and audiences have not done justice.Followed by the FAR superior Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors from 1987.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
234,Hypercentury,AWFUL,4,2 June 1999,"Ten reasons that make this movie the worst movie ever made.

I have to admit that this wasn't bad but was worth watching it. The violence was a bit cut out until towards the end which was pretty good. The story could have improved a bit but was really good. Once again you don't really see Freddy that much, so don't expect the movie to be all about him. I think the plot was entertaining but spent too much time talking about Jesse and Freddy taking his place but other than that I was impressed.

236,ashturner-79373,"A step down from its predecessor, but with good gay subtext.",5,18 March 2019,"Where previously Freddy Krueger was kind of a boring villain with an interesting backstory, here it feels like Freddy is not only more expressive, but has more of a purpose - literally to return to the real world, and symbolically to torment Jesse with his buried homosexuality. Freddy's still not that great, sometimes feeling like he's just there, but his presence is a little more sinister this time around. As in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984), the only good protagonist is the lead, in this case Jesse.The pacing of this film feels aimless at times, where Freddy only kills one person during the first hour or so before finally entering the real world, at which point he kills another main character and then simply kills a few extras at a pool party. The first and last scenes of the film poorly imitate those of the first ""Nightmare"" (the initial nightmare with Freddy, and the final twist that Freddy's still around), and everything inbetween is basically waiting around because Freddy doesn't seem to have much power in dreams any more - so his gimmick from the first film isn't put to use, and the alternate approach of putting him in the real world just leads to a bunch of goofy deaths at a pool party.The score is bland, and the cinematography only stands out a couple of times - mainly in the power plant where Freddy used to work, but also Jesse's transformation into Freddy. The recurring heat motif is a nice visual throughout. What this film really does best is conveying Jesse's repressed homosexuality through his interactions with both Grady and Schneider, as well as their sweaty, naked death scenes which Jesse sees through Freddy's eyes.While this beats the first ""Nightmare"" on a thematic level, it really isn't a very good slasher movie. As a sequel it nicely references the previous film's Nancy and builds on Freddy symbolically, but it doesn't take full advantage of what he's capable of, and so the first film's strongest aspect (its creative and well-paced kills) is almost completely missing.5/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
237,horrorflicklover,"Slow-paced, uneven execution hampers what would have been a solid sequel",5,31 October 2013,"I can deal with the premise. I can even deal with the homoerotic undertones. What I can't deal with is the fact that we wade through about 40 minutes of this film before Freddy even gets his first victim. And the action didn't even get intense until the last half-hour or so.I thought this film was better the first few times I saw it. Watching it again, I've re-evaluated my position on it. They could have had a hit here. The formula for a stellar sequel is right in the plot. But it's so unevenly distributed and short-changed that it's hard to get excited. The character development is just fine. That is, Jesse morphing in to Freddy to bring him in to the real world. The problem is that they didn't present enough payoff throughout this particular plot point to really make the buildup worth it. Hell, the uneven pacing could have been forgiven had there really been a payoff towards the climax. We could write off a slow start had the latter half of the movie really wowed us. It too fell short.Also, when I say ""uneven pacing"", I'm not just referring to the events of the plot. I'm referring to the fact that some of the scenes themselves have too much idle time in between character interaction. There needs to be a little less staring. If they were attempting to build suspense, it didn't really work. I just got that they slowed the scene down and made it harder to suspend disbelief. It could have been saved too, had it a great ending. But this is easily one of my least favorite endings to any of the Nightmare films. Now, the absolute final ending is okay. But Freddy's demise simply seemed to weak for me, not particularly believable. Nightmare 2 has some great points, too. The pool scene was, for the most part, excellent. A few bones to pick, again with the execution. But overall, it's excellent. And the cinematography when Freddy delivers his immortal line ""You are all my children now"" was also terrific. The problem was, it was over too soon. Not enough action, and not enough payoff when we finally received it.I have to also say that I like that they were ambitious, and strove to move in a different direction. That didn't bother me. It was still only the second movie in to the franchise. I also like that Freddy is still dark in this film, as opposed to wisecracking and campy (which he became in later films). But it all came down to how it was executed, and Nightmare 2 just falls short in that regard.Thankfully, Nightmare 3 was a much better movie. It also involved the Nancy Thompson storyline (which is only referenced in Nightmare 2). Thus, it's unaffected by this movie. This is a film only for the hardcore Nightmare fans (like me) who just have to see every movie. Otherwise, feel free to skip it. It's not the worst in the series (Freddy's Dead takes that by a long mile). In fact, I still prefer it over the more action-packed Nightmare 4. But it's one that lukewarm fans of the series could do without.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The film is about a teen boy (played by Mark Patton) who moves into the Elm Street house and falls prey to Freddy Krueger.It's not very good at all.  The story is as slow as a snail. The actors are not all THAT bad but the script by David Chaskin is lacking both purpose and originality.  It doesn't rip off the first but at times you wished it would.

239,theeintolerablekidd,Not a good film but actually quite interesting in a sociological context,5,21 May 2009,"I just watched the first ""A Nightmare on Elm St"" for the first time all the way through, in one viewing, a few days ago. It wasn't fantastic by any means but it was an enjoyable movie. I thought to myself I would have fun over the next week watching all the sequels in turn, which unlike the first I haven't even seen bits of, but after this, and the even worse (in my opinion) third instalment, I am definitely not going to bother. Most of the ""Elm St"" fan's reviews on here say this film is the worst in the series. I don't know if that's true because like I said, after the third I'm not going to bother watching any more, but for me this film at least stands a chance of a second viewing, maybe 30 years from now I might consider watching it again, but the third... no way. This is a below par sub standard horror film. There is nothing scary about it, maybe it was in it's time, but as one reviewer pointed out ""this film was 80s even in the 80s"" and I can see why, but despite being a really crap horror film this movie is actually quite interesting in a sociological way. The ""unintended"" homosexual subtext is great. The director Jack Sholder has unintentionally and accidentally created a coming of age film about a young man coming to terms with his sexuality. I'm sure this film must hold a special place on a lot of guys shelves. If you watch it in this way it is actually pretty funny, but sadly even within this context the film is ruined by the awful ending and the lead man Jesse (who is gay in real life) being swayed by the love of his beau Lisa.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
240,goshamorrell,Bloody Good.,4,11 November 2021,"The original 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still to me one of the scariest and best horror films there is, as well as a truly great film in its own right and introduced us to one of the genre's most iconic villains in Freddy Krueger. It is always difficult to do a sequel that lives up to a film as good as 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' let alone one to be on the same level. Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is not a very good sequel to the 1984 Classic Horror film ""A Nightmare on Elm Street. If you recasting to watch any of the 7 films, watch A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). It's not bad looking horror film, but it's not even close to the original. The scares don't even come enough , and while there are effective ones there are also just as many that are perfunctory and pretty tame by 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' series standards. There are some eerie moments, though none of the rest of the film lives up to the bus scene, and some amusing dark humour. The music is suitably haunting. The Nightmare on Elm Street 2 lacks jump scares, and the dark atmosphere that the original had. The ending is a slap in the face and really undoes Freddy's character, he would never do what he does at the end and it doesn't make sense for him to do it.

241,steelcorpfilms,The horrible sequel to the fantastic original.,4,3 September 2001,"I think I could safely say that this was the worst out of the series.  It ignored the first basic rule that the first one lay down, which was Freddy is a dream creature.  They made the fatal error of bringing Freddy into the real world and it's one of the reasons that make this movie so bad. Another interesting tidbit, the door in the first one was blue and in this one it's red and if I remember right, the door is red in the rest of the sequels as well.This was a very gay movie, and I'm not saying that as an insult.  There were a lot of homosexual undertones.  Now, I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but it didn't help any to have the hero' scream really high pitched like.Anyway, onto the acting, which was mediocre at best.  Englund of course did a good job once again portraying Freddy Krueger, but everyone else seemed to just be trying too hard.  Another thing that differed from the first `Nightmare' was the fact that I didn't really care about any of the characters very much.  As far as I was concerned, Freddy could have killed them all and it would've been a better movie.The story, oh man, what can I say about the story?  It was decent enough I guess, but it could've been a hell of a lot better.  It seemed like they were trying to play on hallucination tricks as opposed to actually trying to get any kind of real plot.  If they had stopped trying to mess with the audiences mind so much and actually got a good story going, it would have been a lot better.  As it stands, it's an average possession story; it's just too bad it doesn't fit Freddy whatsoever.  One of the worst scenes has to be when Freddy is terrorizing a large group of teens by a swimming pool (in the real world, no less).  There are quite a few of the teens that dwarf Freddy and he doesn't seem intimidating or scary at all.The effects were good at least; I'll give the movie that.  I particularly enjoyed the exploding bird.  There's also a really good melting Freddy shot near the end.  Other than that, nothing really special, a model shot at the beginning that looked okay, I guess.It seemed like a rush job to me.  Something thrown together really quick to appease fans of the first and in the process they made a pretty crappy movie.

242,utslitt,Freddy's Back!,6,12 July 2019,"First off, I feel like I owe this movie an apology. I went into this thinking it was going to be a stupid rip off, trying to cash in on the still running heat of Krueger's first debut. While there might be some truth in that, the film itself was surprisingly entertaining and actually a very decent horror film, sequel or not.While we don't see any returning characters other than Freddy K himself, this film is just as gut churningingly tense as it's predecessor. The opening scene alone setting the most dreadful atmosphere for the rest of the movie had my anxiety going off the charts, working overtime. I usually eat something while watching movies, so I had to put my food down for that opening scene because it succeeded in its job of putting absolute dread in the viewers heart.As the movie progresses we are witness to some hauntingly breathtaking special effects that sell their scenes in such a manner it feels like we're in the movie and Freddy is coming for us. You'd have to be full of it to state there was a lack of creativity anywhere within' this film.The only reason I'm rating this film so low is due to the ending. I felt it got a little out of hand, and on top of that, left a lot of things unanswered. While this could be a good thing if set up properly, instead leaving us to think ""what if"", it doesn't. It happens in such a way that's so ""pick and choose"" with the events that happened during the film resulting in the viewer (or at least myself) feeling as though there was no consistency.

243,RockytheBear,Snubbed at the Oscars...,5,8 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS HAVE SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
This is the type of movie that was 80's back when it was the 80's.  Let's start off with the movie's hero, Jesse-- androgynously played by Mark ""I Have Yet To Make Another Movie"" Patton.  How did this guy get the lead in a flick?  Just look at him.  And how 'bout that Oscar winning bedroom dance number he did.  Take special note of the part where he closes his dresser drawer with his butt.  I was laughing so hard, no sound was coming out my body.  ""How do you like THAT, Dad!""  I guess he told him.  This scene alone sealed the film in my opinion as an instant cinematic classic. 
I first saw this movie in theaters when I was just a fetus, and I thought it was bad.  Now I'm watching it 20 years later and boy, was I wrong.  It's horrible.  Let's start with the credits, which read ""Special Appearance by Clu Gulager;""  the same man who happens to be in every scene of the movie. Our main character, Jesse wakes up screaming from a nightmare and sounds a lot like a woman; but this dream is nothing compared to his ""gym teacher"" nightmare.  Note the end of this dream, where Jesse looks at his hand and sees he is wearing the famous razor glove.  When he screams, oh my god.  I must have rewound the scream about 12 times.  I think Fay Wray's voice was dubbed over his, because he shrills like the classic women of the 30's. This may very well be the movie's finest hour.     Was this scene even in the original version?  For some reason, I don't remember Killer Basketballs when I saw this in the theater.  Was I watching a director's cut or something?  This couldn't have been in theaters, could it?  I must be slipping in my old age, because I would have been laughing too hard to forget a scene like Killer Basketballs.  This scene is second place only to the unbeatable Killer Braces scene in Poltergeist 2.
Midway through Freddy's Revenge, Alfred Hitchcock takes over and directs a cool ""When Parrots Attack"" scene.  The scene comes out of nowhere, but the sudden shifting of gears is welcomed in this movie.  The parrot destroys his lovebird partner, and for some reason, Jesse lets the Cujo of birds out of his cage.  The bird then begins to terrorize the family and by this time, the scene is going great.  Easily comparable to the great shower scene of Psycho, or when Michael Corleone kisses Fredo.  The director then gets tired of this sequence and decides to end it by having the bird explode into thin air.  What a disappointment!!  They could have dropped Freddy and expounded with this bird concept for the rest of the movie!  I was having a ball.  It was clearly the only well thought-out scene of the movie.  Hollywood just doesn't make enough Attack Bird movies.  That's exactly what this industry needs!  More Attack Bird movies!  If Titanic had an Attack Bird scene, I guarantee you nobody would have complained about the 7 hour running time. The possibilities are endless when it comes to movies about disgruntled birds.  Freddy's Revenge is directed by some guy named Jack Sholder.  Now I don't know who this guy is, and I have a theory as to why we've never heard of him again:  Once he got famous, he eventually changed his name to Joel Schumacher.  Laugh if you must, but I am convinced the two men are one and the same.  Jack Sholder is as queer as a 3 dollar bill.  Not that I am gay bashing, but I do like my slasher flicks more scary and less Rocky Horror. How gay was Freddy's Revenge,"" let me count the ways:1.) A slasher movie starring a man is unheard of.  We want breasts, Hollywood! 2.) Our freakishly feminine hero, has the unisexual name ""Jesse."" 3.) More locker room and shower scenes than you can shake a stick at.  Get it-- shake a stick at? 4.) Plenty of bare ass shots of men. 5.) What's up with Jesse having that dream at the Blue Oyster bar?  Then the dream evolves into a bondage S&M concept; which is truly a nightmare-- more frightening than anything Freddy could ever do. Oh yeah, that reminds me.  There is also this guy named Freddy who goes around killing people or something.  I don't know, who cares?

And to this day its one of my favorite top 10 horror films of all time. The whole idea of a dream demon invading the teenagers dreams on Elm Street in Springwood was so interesting and a whole new concept from the over done killer wearing a mask killing people. When we got introduced to Freddy Krueger played by Robert England we saw a character that came onto his own and didn't copy something else that had been done to death. I loved everything about the first film and then when I got done watching it I watched part 2 with the same excitement and wondered if it could pass the first film in suspense and horror. I can say this film didn't come close to the first film in terms of horror. I will admit its not the worst in the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise but it isn't close to the best. I just didn't think the whole story of Freddy trying to get back into the real world was logical. The whole point of Freddy being a dream demon is because hes about killing teenagers of the adults of Springwood who had hunted him down and killed him when he was a human. He was about getting revenge and tormenting the kids because the adults cant protect their kids in their dreams. Freddy trying to get back into the real world just goes against his whole revenge where the adults cant protect their kids approach. I also felt the characters were just coming off as too macho and tough at times. I felt like they didn't come off as teenage kids with normal teenage lives. Another approach was the character of Lisa. Normally a female is always the one who stops Freddy and is exstablished throughout the film. But she really didn't get much screen time in this as Jessie did and she really didn't start fighting Freddy until the final maybe 30 minutes of the film. To me this film was average. Again its not the worst but not the best. I still think the worst film in the Nightmare On Elm Street film was Freddys Dead the Final Nightmare. If you want to pass the time then go for it and watch the film. But don't expect the film to be as good as part 1.,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
245,Jonny-ironica,Actually grew on me over time.,5,19 April 2016,"Let me start by saying for awhile, this film competed with Part 6(Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare) for worst in the series. Then after a few more views of it and the rest of the series, it flip- flopped with Part 5(The Dream Child) as the second worst.Having re-watched the entire series in a marathon over a couple of days, I finally came to terms with this film. There's much to praise, probably as much as there is to denounce. The positive aspects include the dark tone. Freddy would never be as dark and serious as he was in the first two films. True, there were flickers of humor in his mannerisms and actions, but it never went all-out comedy. Another positive aspect I've come to enjoy is the homosexual subtext. The idea that Freddy represents the main character's repressed sexuality fighting it's way out. Growing up, I found this laughable, but the more I think about, the more I realize: fighting homosexuality, being closeted, resisting the urges in order to keep yourself safe in a society that is still not 100% okay with who you are is terrifying. And in the '80s with the AIDS scare being new and heavily labeled as a ""gay-only disease"", this must've really struck a chord with some people. That's horror. It's a real feeling. And though it takes the gay tones a bit too far to the camp side at times, that's what horror of the '80s was known for. A blend of camp and terror. Another thing to enjoy about the film is that even though they had a completely new cast and characters, they still found a way to link it to the first. Had this film been critically successful, I don't think I would've minded the franchise becoming a stream of sequels about different teens moving into the house and discovering Freddy in new and terrifying ways. With the exception of Dream Warriors and New Nightmare, it would've been far superior to the trash we would've ended up with.BUT as much as I enjoy things about this film, there's still too much wrong with it for me to thoroughly enjoy as a ""great"" entry in the series. I'm not going to talk about how things in this film were ""against the rules"" of the series because at the time, the ""series"" did not exist so it wasn't breaking any rules. Freddy got into the real world in part 1, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to through other means. The pool party I do not dislike for Freddy being in the ""real world."" I dislike the party because I did not know a single thing about any of those teens. No names, no characteristics, nothing. This film could've used 3 or 4 more characters with some development to kill off rather than throw in a pool scene that seemed only to be made to make sure the body count wasn't the dramatically low 3 it would've been without it. Probably one of the bigger reasons I can't love this film is the way Freddy was defeated, which is actually a lot closer to the first film that most people seem to think. Cheesy, a bit overacted, not that climactic.So, after years and years of having this film sit with a 1 star rating on IMDb, I bump it up to a mediocre 5.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
246,moz-1,Not the first sequel to the greatest film ever.,5,13 March 2001,"There never should have been any sequels to Nightmare on elm street.  It was a substantial and scary stand-alone in the horror genre.  Yet, greedy NewLine producers forced Craven to compramise his original finale to leave an open end and leave the movie vulnerable to a scarring case of sequelitis. Now I have always been quite open and fair to the sequels, because frankly, I think Freddy Kreuger is a great character, but this is a pretty fragmented, bad movie. The narrative of this film revolves around the nervous Jesse, who is being tormented by Freddy; but he never really faces any danger, just a Candyman-esque plot about Freddy trying to take him over and kill in the real world.  Now, the first films premice was amazing; so why change the idea so much in only the second film.  Surely we should have followed Nancy, through college perhaps (like in Scream 2), but instead this film scars the whole idea irrepairably.  When we return to the original idea in number 3, the essence of the original is lost.  Still, this one has some original ideas that would have been great in a different story; this needn't have involved Freddy, it would have been an interesting stand-alone piece. There's some good special effects from Kevin Yagher and some nice ideas, but the acting is poor and the good ideas do not link smoothly.  This sits uncomfortably in the early half of the series. A big disappointment.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
247,Phrankster163,Something went wrong along the way.,6,9 May 2006,"The setup for NOES 2 was actually pretty good. The only problem with it is that the one who wrote it obviously hadn't been paying any attention while watching the first one, because the whole idea is that A: Freddy wants revenge on the parents that torched him, and therefore he's after their children and B: Freddy controls his part of the dream world, it's where he's god and so he has no intention of wanting to enter our world again. The story begins with Jesse (the only time they tried a male lead in the series) having nightmare's that remind us a little too much of the ending in part one, but anyway Jesse's got a hot new semi-girlfriend and he's quickly becomes buddies with the brash Grant, who's your classic 80's rebel type. Weird occurrences keep happening around him, and when his gym teacher (a homosexual Nazi type) get killed, Jesse's the perp or rather Freddy, since he is taking over Jesse body, so Jesse can kill for him. Soon Freddy is going for the complete takeover, and eventually he gets free and wreaks some havoc at a barbecue party. Good idea, but it goes against the entire premise of the Freddy character. The ending's rather predictable but adding the power plant (since it's an important part of the series's mythos) was a really good idea. Surprises me that this one ranks over both 4,5 and 6 since it's generally thought of as the weakest of the sequels.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
248,catalog,Almost the Worst of the Series,4,30 November 1999,"Nightmare 2 is a very bad movie.  It's not the worst of the series ( I reserve that distinction for Freddy's Dead), but it comes damn close.I think it basically boils down to the studio trying to make a buck off the surprising popularity of the original.  The principal problem with the story is that it breaks every rule set by the first movie and followed by every other movie in the series (including Freddy's Dead).  Freddy was never meant to be in the real world.  It's that simple.However, there are some interesting things in this movie.  The pool party sequence is interesting only because it proposes the question: what if Freddy faced off against twenty or so teenagers?  That question is never answered, and the rest of the movie doesn't make much sense (why does Freddy kill the coach?).I guess maybe die-hard fans of the series will find something worth watching, but Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is more of a curiosity piece than anything else.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
249,iamthehollow,Venom.,3,12 October 2004,"This film is an insult to the previous film. Firstly its more of a 're-imagining' than a sequel, this is arrogance in the extreme when you consider the dross that was produced. It takes everything that makes the original great and just abandons it, its almost like the 'film-makers' responsible thought, 'Gosh, all that atmosphere and tension has got to go, and that Freddy love hes just soooooo mean and scary, lets change him from a child killer to a homo-phobe'. The films homo-erotic undertones/overtones are very strange to say the least. Puzzling almost, you wonder what they thought they were making. It shatters the very cool premise of the original into a bazillion pieces, breaks EVERY rule set down. The acting is third rate, even Englund. For an example of what a proper sequel should look like watch Wes Cravens New Nightmare.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
250,talasam12345,Hard to understand and never made any sense for me...,4,23 March 2020,"A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) was a classic and a great horror movie. I like 80s horror movies, almost every one of them. But this sequel was crap. It never made any sense to me, Freddy kills people in the real world, the absolute opposite and worst than the premise of the first movies was. The characters we're one-dimensional and boring. The 2 main protagonists we're OK, but after reading about the homo subtext of the movie ( which i didn't see, but thought almost everything about Jesse was just stupid) i start to think that this film (and the main character) i have contradictory feelings..The're were soo much stupid moments - the dogs with the WORST human masks, the cat that looked like a tiger, the final scene where Freddy just suddenly dies, because a railing burned, and Lisa just fighting him with love... This is just not A Nightmare on Elm Street movie, this is something else. They tried to do something different, but failed.The're are some positives about the movie , but not much.
Freddy was at his most creepy and scary in maybe every A Nightmare on Elm Street movie, his face was just nastyy. The bus scene at the beginning was kinda cool but that's about it.

251,stepflan,Worst sequel,5,24 February 2008,"This is defiantly the worst Freddy movie in the series. Thankfully you don't necessarily have to watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street movie to understand the rest of them since the story has nothing to do with any of the other movies (except from the fact that Freddy's in it). This film is a perfect example of what a sequel NOT should look like. It's bloody awful! When I first saw this I thought this was the downward spiral for the Freddy series. And that the money I spent on the ""A Nightmare on elm street box"" was a waste of money. But thankfully I was wrong. The rest of the series wasn't all that bad as this one. Yep, it sucked that bad. Yet, I have to say it can be a little entertaining in some scenes. Freddy is still in it as promised, so there are some quality stuff. But if you're watching this movie you will pay more attention looking at your watch all the time, rather than looking at the film because this film is just boring and painful to watch.For some people this may go in the ""so bad, it's good"" category. But for me it just didn't work out that way. It was a huge disappointment. The original A Nightmare on Elm Street movie is truly one of the best horror movies. It's a classic. And just after they made the film it made a really huge success and so I guess Hollywood wanted to exploit that.The effects looked really terrible in the film. I normally love it when the effects look very cheesy, but it just didn't work out for me this time.I guess if you're a Nightmare on Elm Street fan then this movie fan then this could be a little interesting.

It could've been much better with improved dialogue and elements of the story changed to make sense. In fact, many of the minor story elements that are nonsensical or just dumb are the second biggest problem. The first major problem is Mark Patton. He is just not a good actor.

256,imnotjohncandy,Freddy's Back,7,7 September 2021,"Ah, Nightmare On Elm Street. The franchise that has made us all afraid to sleep at night and introduced people to the concept of a killer who can kill people in their dreams in the form of Mr Freddy Krueger, of course Freddy became so popular that merchandise of the character was made and he got his own tv show in the form of Freddy's Nightmares. I think it's time I talked about the second movie Freddy's Revenge. In the franchise in general this one is often dubbed the 'homoerotic' Elm Street movie because of the supposed subtext which probably wasn't intentional, but the lead actor is gay in real life so maybe it was...I don't know, originally they didn't want Robert Englund back as Freddy and were considering getting someone else but they brought Robert Englund back and he reprised the role in this and all of the others up until Freddy VS Jason. I like a lot of things about this, mainly the idea of Freddy possessing someone and controlling them into killing others while under his control, and also the scene of Freddy coming out of the main character's body....is one impressive sequence. I'd like to see that being used in an Elm Street fanfic myself.The only problem is that I think how Freddy goes out is a bit weak, I mean...the power of love does it, really?

To add insult to injury, Freddy's Revenge makes little to no sense.  Any connections to the original are slight at best, and the whole concept of Freddy's ""essence"" making Jesse kill falls apart towards the middle of the film, especially during a pretty pointless (but very imaginative) SFX sequence.  The movie plods along with very little actual gore until the infamous pool party scene, but even that seems held back and lazily directed (plus you'll probably still be wondering just what the hell is going on when you're watching...more than the other sequels, Nightmare 2 completely tramples on the rules Craven set down in the original).

The writer obviously doesn't know how to write a feature length script because he adds random bullcrap to make the movie longer like that pointless dancing scene. The characters are unlikable and despite Robert Englund's good performance, he wasn't scary like he was in the first movie. What also ticked me off was that guy telling Freddy Krueger to relax. Does he honestly think he can say that without getting killed?

It doesn't have that same classic, masterpiece flavor (and doesn't even have any of the fun) of its predecessor. Unfortunately, the concept of 'You got the body, and I got the brain' COULD have made this sequel worthy of the might of the original, but the film suffers from trying to go for 'high budget action-horror' (ie the viewer can tell that this film had a bigger budget than NOES1, and it went into exploding hot dogs). Despite long sequences of boredom, the viewer is rewarded with some interesting scenes (the finale is pretty Halloween/haunted house-esque...I like the Rottweilers with the creepy doll faces & the ugly rats). The only scene in the film of real value is the murder of Ron Grady. By far the best scene in the film/one of the bests in the films in the ES franchise I've seen thus far (at the time of this writing I've seen: the original, new nightmare, the 2010s remake, and now this one); the scene has incredible body horror, a fascinating ""losing my mind"" tension, and a grisly murder. All this being said, this film earns 5 stars for that scene alone (and most of the scene's power is built upon the worldbuilding of the original).

However, upon seeing it, this sequel to Wes Craven's hit scare-fest wasn't nearly as bad as what many critics make out.The story focuses a Jesse, a young teenager. His family moved into the house vacated by the main character of the original and, sure enough, weird things start to happen. Jesse is possessed by the soul of a deceased child-killer Freddy Kruger, and Freddy uses Jesse to kill the children of Elm Street. According to fans, the main reason for the hatred of ""Freddy's Revenge"" is because that this film wasn't consistent with the first. Freddy is too dark a character (he plays almost a satanic force in this film) and there are too many homosexual themes running through the movie. This I found barely noticeable and didn't detract from the story whatsoever.In short, this sequel to ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" is only marginally worse than the first. The special effects are quite terrific and there are some very bloody murders at the hand of Freddy Kruger's trademark knives, along with some genuine scares. However, if I was to fault this film, it would have to be its pace. Be warned - it is quite slow at times but, when it takes off about half way through the film, it is relentless.

If we were to compare the parts of the film, it would look something like this:Beginning: Nightmare 1 wins here. It's more mysterious than 2. In 1 Tina's in a boiler room with Fred Krueger scratching his knives on things. In 2 Jesse's on a bus and suddenly Krueger's driving and they're on some sort of pillar with lava below them. Middle: I don't want to retell every part of both movies, so I'll just tell you who wins: Number 1, but not by a whole lot, sort of a 10-9 thing. 1 has more suspense, 2 has more plot development and explains things better. But in 1, we care about the characters more. And that's why it wins.
End: That would go to 2. The climax is more exciting. In 1 the ending kind of sucked, with bringing Krueger into the real world with Nancy putting traps all over the place... Yeah, it was nor so good. But in 2 he comes into the real world and starts killing kids at a party. It was way better.

""Freddy's Revenge"" definitely beats the first film by a long shot, cuz its more scary and Freddy is so much more terrifying than the other films. Another cool aspect is while the other films have Freddy portrayed as a stand alone killer, this entry has the dream killer in a more psychological aspect in that he has to possess a person to continue his evil spree, thus creating a more haunting tale than all the others. This also, in my opinion, is the darkest of the elm street series, especially the climactic pool party scene in which Freddy chillingly claims ""You are all my children Now!"" one of his best quotes. the acting by Patton and Meyers is excellent, and Robert Englund turns Freddy into a more menacing fiend than the last film.

I still only consider it to be about average, but that's a lot better then what I use to call it. Well, Freddy is back, and he wants revenge! Robert Englund does a phenomenal job once again as our favorite Christmas sweatered maniac. The rest of the cast, not so much. This time around we focus on Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), a young lad who has moved in to a new home with his family, and guess who's former home it use to be, dun dun dun...So inevitably, Freddy starts terrorizing the fresh meat. Stalking him through his dreams, while slowly taking control over his body ""You've got the body...I've got the brain"". The first nightmare we see, I must say is fairly well done. In this nightmare, we see Jesse on the school bus heading home with Robert Englund appearing in his normal form as the bus driver (nice!). They go on a little off road field trip, as our innocent bus driver becomes Freddy, and gives our hero a lil' scare. Luckily Jesse wakes up, covered in sweat, screaming (...like a girl) just before Freddy can rip him to shreds. They definitely took this film in a different direction having a male lead in a slasher. Sometimes it's good to be different, but not in this case...As many already know, this movie has a heavy homo-erotic undertone, and in my opinion it does affect the movie in a not so positive way. Whether it's Jesse's all-star dance moves while cleaning his room, his high pitch screams, the gym teacher in the gay bar, the shower scene or the weird buddy buddy relationship between Jesse and high school friend Grady (Robert Rusler), it's pretty hard to deny that it's there. Over the years, I've somewhat learned to look past this and would suggest others to do the same to make it more enjoyable.This movie definitely breaks some of the rules created in the first film, such as things happening outside of dreams like the family budgie going haywire and exploding in mid-air (WTF!) and toasters catching fire, basically pure randomness. Well now that I think about it, the whole plot is breaking the rules, but this sequel was clearly rushed out quick-time but what can you do.One thing that I love about this movie is that Freddy is still scary, he has a few really great scenes in this, unfortunately they're too far in between. The scene where Freddy takes off his hat, pulls back his skin to reveal his brain is great, reminiscent of Freddy cutting off his fingers in the original. Then towards the end of the film, we're treated with a couple others like Freddy finally taking full control of Jesse and coming out from within, shedding the Jesse layer of skin before giving Grady a much deserved shanking. Then there's the pool party massacre with Freddy in the real world and not giving a damn, quite entertaining, although unrealistic to the rest of the series, as Freddy still seems to have some supernatural powers he's known for in nightmares.One major complaint I have with this film, is the conclusion, it's extremely anti-climatic. With Freddy having full control of things in the real world through Jesse, it's up to high-school crush/girlfriend Lisa Webber(Kim Myers) to save him. She goes searching for Jesse/Freddy at the old Powerplant, hence the boiler rooms always appearing in dreams (I guess Freddy must have really liked that job as that's the first place he goes while being in the real world). While making her way inside she must walk by guard dogs with human faces (hmm...The Unborn, not so original now are we). Once finding and confronting Freddy, they have the shortest chase ever, and right when he's about to kill her...he can't! Wanna know why? Because she loves Jesse too much and wants him back, so she kisses Freddy/Jesse as her deathblow to the dream demon...er...reality demon...and that melts him...what an exhilarating finish, quite epic *rolls eyes*. It's pretty clear this film has it's faults, but at the same time, it does have some great Freddy moments thrown in there. At the end of the day, it's a really sub par sequel to an incredible original. A forgettable entry that is pretty much ignored through the rest of the series. Hmm...normally I'd be upset with a series doing this, but in this case maybe that was a good thing.5/10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

274,kywise1200,The best in my opinion,9,28 October 2019,"Easily the best one of the series for me. It is the only one that is even slighty unsettling. The score provided by the one-and-only Christopher Young (the most underrated composer in the business) is an overwhelming reason why this film is effective. I love the Bernstein score, but it is 80s cheese. Young's score was a prelude to the dazzling music of Hellraiser, and it works so well. The score for the 3rd installment is a joke. It ruins it for me. Freddy is by far the best version of himself. The makeup and lighting compliment each other, and make for some very iconic imagery. All of these movies are pretty awful, but this one has sparks that shine so much brighter.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
275,AdamCatalyst,A fascinatingly subversive touchstone of LGBT cinema...,6,16 October 2017,"When I put on this movie tonight, I assumed it would be a weak sequel to a nightmare on Elm Street. Woah, it ended up being so much more! Yes, it is in fact a weak sequel to a Nightmare on Elm street, but it is also a highly subversive story about a young gay man who cannot face his budding sexuality. Oftentimes the metaphor is more interesting than what is ostensibly on-screen, and it would be a mistake to consider this film on its surface level alone. I have watched thousands of movies, and hundreds of horror films, and have never seen anything quite like this. In the end, I'd actually recommend watching this mediocre slasher sequel, as an entertaining and fascinating touchstone of LGBT cinema, brilliantly subverting the genre right in front of mainstream audience's eyes.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

The camaraderie of the two principle male characters is an added twist and enhances the story. At first they seem like they are not going to get along and get into a fight but later comically tease each other in class with both taunting the other by friendly laughter at the right moment. Also the love interest between the girl and her ride to school is intriguing and does not cross the boundaries early in the game. *possible spoiler* The 2nd appearance of Fred is fun also with him hiding in the bushes then appearing in the boiler room and then taunting the lead dude by using a famous line that I will not divulge here by spoiler. This movie is underrated and deserves a second look by Freddie fans. It is far from boring and IMO is the most entertaining in the series.

"" A nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge""Well first of let me say this movie sucked alot. The beginning shows a school bus going to no where and then all of a sudden its in the desert and you hear freddy laughing. Then the main character wakes up and relizes its a dream. Then he keeps dreaming. Nothing happens except freddy laughs. Then more into the movie he kills a phys ed teacher. But wait I thought he only killed KIDS in their DREAMS! But he killed an ADULT in the REAL WORLD! Then all the kids are at this party and Freddy comes and none of them are dreaming. Then the most idiotic ending. The main character becomes FREDDY!

Direction, writing... Feels like they went with the first things that came to their heads, with no thoughts given. Craven's ability to build suspense (which made first movie great) is noticeably missing in this one. The script needed more work on it, too. Some scenes felt rushed, some forced... General vibe of the movie is confusing and not coherent.On the plus side, actors did a good job and made up for the poor script (and direction), at least for me. Like I mentioned in my review of the first part, you don't expect great acting in a slasher, but, so far, I'm pleasantly surprised with this franchise.

Some of the music is good too. The acting was alright as well. I thought the girlfriend was a good actor. The story isn't very good and at some points I found it to be completely illogical.It's just a very different kind of movie. I personally just don't like that Freddy takes control of someone. I liked it when we get to see the dream world but this was pretty much all in reality and in the same factory shots. It was really boring.I liked the whole relationship thing with the main character and a girl and his friendship with that guy who was being mean to him.

The movie has great special effects by Kevin Yagher. Robert plays the bus driver in the beginning of the film. The film picks up during the last half of the film. Nancy is only mentioned in a diary that she left in the house that is found by Lisa and by Jesse's best friend Ron. This chapter in the series is for die hard nightmare fans only.

For example, hmmm... I thought Freddy only has power in the dream world, but since when he's able to possess human body in the real world? Come on, this is not an Exorcist movie!!!The fright & gore are good. The helplessness as well as loneliness of the lead character (Jesse) really help augment the horror atmosphere of the film in that, to me, the less main characters there are in this type of movie, the more horrifying the film will be (just like part 1)!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

290,jonn_en,Utter nonsense...,1,23 January 2006,"I always use to wonder what these 80s-90s horror movies had in them that production houses use to go for sequels one after other. But after watching movies like Nightmare 1 & 2 and Friday the 13th (don't remember the parts, have seen at least 3 of them), I am sure these movies were nothing short of crap, taste of ppl in the 80s-90s was so bad that these movies went on to become super successes. If these movies were released somewhere in the late 90s or current decade, all these wud have flopped badly.Now coming to the movie in question, I had a lot of expectations from the Nightmare movie series, so I got the first 3 parts in the series. After watching the first, I was like what was the director trying to show, I cud hardly under the movie, especially the climax and the scenes where Freddy comes out of her dreams... I am still guessing was it all just a dream? But did not hate the movie coz the movie had a fresh idea... not tried by anybody before this movie.But the second one was so disappointing, firstly a character like Jesse, they should have used some girl character instead that would have added some value to the movie. Just because they wanted Freddy to takeover some human body, they mite have chosen a male character, else I don't see any reason for using a male central character.The story was so bad, in fact there was no story at all, something that exists only in Dreams and can only be effective if U fear him, comes out to the real world... cant digest that.Then all the scenes after Freddy takes over Jesse are horrible, the love scenes, the pool party, then the boiler room scene (climax)... oh my god, i was feeling like sleeping throughout the movie. It was just horrible, where was the thrill, the scare in the movie, showing some cheesy gfx does not make a movie scary...That's it guys, it was horrible... will never get any other Nightmare or Friday the 13th movie again in my life...",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

292,benjaminconvey,Underrated.....,4,28 November 2000,"I recently watched this film for the first time in a while. Originally, as a kid, I liked this, but then I didn't really have much ability to discern between this or any other Freddy film.Later, a couple of years ago, I revisited the movie and it seemed so bad I couldn't even watch all of it. The acting was appaling, it wasn't scary, there was 80s cheese everywhere, and it just didn't click.I just watched it again however, and my opinions have really flipped. I honestly enjoyed it. I think the concept is actually quite good. Sure, there is some loss of logic when Freddy eventually does come into the real world, but its all rather ambiguous and open to interpretation anyway: if it weren't, what kind of a film would it be?This episode of the Elm Street saga lacks that famous music that marks the first (and rest) of the films. Instead, it features a rather standard horror movie strings score that works rather effectively. While it isn't traditionally scary, the music (and quite masterful camerawork at times) really works to create a feeling of unease.So the lead actor is a pretty shoddy actor, and there is a little bit too much ""80s"" trash involved, but this is an admirable attempt to take the Freddy motif to the next level. Certainly the themes of abandoned teenagers, middle America and sexual maturation are all evident here, and it certainly 'feels' in the same vein as the first. If anything, this film is the most in keeping with the spirit of the original Nightmare On Elm Street than any of the other sequels, even if it does disobey the cardinal rule of Freddy: he exists ONLY in our dreams.It worked quite well for me.(It must be mentioned however that those theories that this film is a metaphor for a young male coming to terms with his homosexuality are REMARKABLY well founded.

The reason I mentioned that quote is because that one, and many others like it are what make this movie so funny. (I'm not even going to get into the sounds of Jesse's screams). Freddy has so many one liners that will have you busting up (if you pay attention). Not quite as good as the first, and not really scary, if you will. None of 'em are. The special effects are OK, but it's the acting, as I always say, that you need pay attention to. If you do, you'll find so many UN-intentional comedy props you wont even believe it. Try looking at Freddy's face when they do close ups. I'm sure this was intended to be frightening but it ended up as comedy at it's best.

The first nightmare film was a great horror movie of its time, because it established the hard and fast rule that Freddy could only exist in the dream world. It then went and played with the audiences minds by never letting them know exactly when characters were dreaming or when they were awake. This milk the cow sequel has Freddy doing a lame slice-and-dice job at a pool party in the real world for Christ sake!!!This is without mentioning the scene where Freddy causes the toaster to break. OH NO! Not only will he kill your kids but you will have to spend a fortune on replacing your small appliances.For a horror movie, it doesn't have much of anything to actually scare. There's no tension, suspense, or atmosphere and Freddy's crazy dream world rarely appears. You might hope to expect a series of bloody murders to keep slasher fans happy, and even then there is not enough action to keep people interested. The lead actors are rather poor and lines like ""animals don't normally explode for no reason"" make it almost unwatchable. I can go on and on about all the problems I have with the film. I can also say that the director of this has a bad resume with Wishmaster 2 and Supernova and if I could I would have this guy arrested for making bad films.A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is a poor sequel to a great horror movie, The first mistake was switching the hero's sex and the second mistake was the lack of Wes Craven.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Here are the reasons why i disliked this film. First off Freddy hardly appears in the film. Instead it decided to focus more on the main character Jesse other than focusing more on Freddy. Another reason is that i didn't like the whole idea of Freddy being inside Jesse's body and taking over it. I also didn't like the whole signs of gay themes used in the film. And finally the last reason i disliked the film was because instead of Freddy killing people in their nightmares he kills people in the real world. I hated that idea why couldn't they connect with the first film and have Freddy kill people in their nightmares? That is the main thing i disliked the most about the film. But other than those dislikes about the film. I did however like the fact they got Robert Englund to come back as Freddy.

306,Micsta,The Viewer's Worst Nightmare,1,20 January 2001,"Some movies just shouldn't be made at all and Nightmare on Elm street 2 is one of them.This movie is not only the worst of the series but it's even worse than some ""straight to video"" horror films.If there is anything that gives sequels a bad name it is this film.  When we look at sequels we usually abide by the rules of the original unless we are told not to.  This film breaks the one rule that makes Freddy legendary by letting him appear in the real world instead of just dreams.  Although this rule is kinda broken in part 3 and 6 its still not smart to even try this in a 2nd film approach.I can't even give the writer or director credit for the idea that Freddy is inside the main character's body because it just doesn't work like that. That's a whole new topic for a different franchise.  Freddy should be in everyone's mind to create good terror.  That brings up the ultimate slashing pool scene (not a spoiler because it's revealed in the trailer at the end which, I must admit, one of the most funny sequences that I have ever seen in my life.  But that scene would only work as a parody of the Freddy series.I don't know if anyone but me realized this but there is more of a homosexual feel in the main characters of this film which is also a big no no for a Freddy movie.  Society just wasn't ready yet for that kind of tone back then.I can go on and on about all the problems I have with the film.  I can also say that the director of this has a bad resume with Wishmaster 2 and Supernova and if I could I would have this guy arrested and beat down for making bad films.For further info I am a really HUGE Freddy fan and I do own the Nightmare Collection.  But I'm very close to either burning my Nightmare 2 DVD or simply just use it as a coaster.  This film is not like other really bad films that still entertain, it's one of those films that make me sick every time I think of it.  Stay clear of this one if ya interested in the series.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge. Ah, that epitome of emptiness and boredom. Why was this film so bad, of course, there's the answer, it was a sequel. Sequels were born to be bad.First, my views on the series. I HATE the Nightmare on Elm Street films. I pretended to myself for so long that I liked them that I even got the DVD Set after I bought all the VHS copies. But there can be no other word for it, the series, after Part1, was rubbish. It was so bad it could not figure out that if Nancy's parents killed Freddy Krueger, they would still be living in 1428 Elm Street, so where did Freddy live? In Nightmare 6, Maggie goes to the back yard of 1428 and finds the water tower, telling her that this is where she used to live before Freddy was burned. That is crap! How can that be? I'm not even gonna waste any more of my time or money on this waste of good film.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
310,zombienosh,"Just eat your eggs, dear...",6,10 January 2007,"I watched this for the first time in ten years last night. For anyone keeping score at home, this version was the one included in the NoES Box Set (Nightmares 1 thru 7).Now I can look upon it with adult eyes, I can confirm it has its weak moments (let's get them out of the way first!) 1. The Dead Parrot Sketch. I really wish this wasn't in the film. The whole scene starts badly - Jesse saying ""My God, it's as hot as an oven in here"" in the least convincing manner ever - and ends with an exploding bird which suddenly grows to twice its original size and then we see the traumatised family (who are probably trying to stifle their laughter) looking at the comedy feathers floating to the ground. Move along, nothing more to see.2. Jesse's Girl-Scream. This has been covered many many times here, so let's move along again.3. The very rushed ""Love Conquers All"" ending. It's not as though the film was running over - it's barely over 85 minutes as it is. This scene also includes a dummy Fred Krueger falling over and making a ""clunk"" sound.4. What's with the Bing Crosby song at the end? I distinctly remember the theme tune from the start playing again during the end credits when I had it on VHS - no disrespect to Mr. C, it's a very nice tune but the film ends on a downer and the music should follow suit. If they wanted this song so badly, it could have fitted in with Lisa's Dad's sucky music selection at the pool party.Other than that, it's still a good film. Quite restrained in terms of gore, but there's a good few jumps and some imaginative sequences. Biggest plus for this film over the others in this series is the incidental music. Films of this genre (and especially films with a modest budget like this one) have awful background music but I'm glad to say this is the exception. Genuinely memorable. And for me, that's what pushes the rating up. Listen to it, you'll know what I mean.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

I won't go too deep into the Queer Film Theory surrounding this particular installment of the franchise ( I made a video on YouTube about that, which you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=coNYGzz2zQ8 ) but as a stand alone film, it is enjoyable to watch, and creepy in it's own right!",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
316,TheSkipper,Very underrated,7,9 November 2002,"A Nightmare on Elm Street part 2 Freddy's revengeMay contain `spoilers'`Mommy, why can't Jesse wake up like everyone else ?'Firstly I'd like to say that I believe this to be the most underrated film in the series. Aside from the first film this is the only other from the series that I still like. As has been mentioned by other people, I think Freddy developed too much of a personality after this film, dispatching victims with comedic one-liners and more stylised, effects based death sequences. In this film his remains pretty much as he was in the first. In fact, probably a little darker.One of the main problems People seem to have with this film is the implied bisexuality of its main character. I personally think it gives the film an Unusual twist. To quote Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) `Nightmare 2 is a very creepy, very kinky film. It reverses the first one - instead of having a teenage girl in jeopardy, we have a bisexual male, and this factor is exploited by Freddy. There's a lot of stuff implied with the S & M bar, stringing up the coach in the shower room bondage situation, and going to his boyfriends house for protection, the two of them take their clothes off as often as possible. All that adolescent mad teenage hormone stuff is explored, which of course Freddy is privy to'.I like the nightmare sequences in this film. To me they have a quality that rings truer to real nightmares than that of the ones in the other sequels. When Jesse (Mark Patton) first spies Freddy lurking in the back yard and then the basement being a prime example. The school bus at the start is also a classic and another that springs to mind is when Jesse awakes in his room to find it's become so hot that things around it like a vinyl record have begun to melt.The score is my personal favourite of the entire series. Christopher Young creates something very unusual using such bizarre sounds as whale calls to good effect. It is a complete departure from the cheesy synth score of the original and because it lacks that familiar piano motif that's heard in all the films, sets it apart much like the film itself.There's also some nice camera work in there to, the shot that follows Jesse as he arrives at school the morning after the murder of the coach is good. Though my favourite has to be the shot that takes us up from the basement (albeit rather poorly cut as you go through the basement door) swerving up the stairs and into Jesse's little sisters room. Freddy's face is never fully visible unlike in the other sequels. Which I always thought was the way it should be kept. We only ever really see his face in a neat shot behind the flames of the broken Barbeque during the pool party scene.The acting from all concerned is solid, Patton and Meryl Streep look-a-like Kim Myers (Lisa) the two leads being particularly good.The film does have plenty of flaws, certain effects shots are very badly rendered. Witness the budgie exploding for a prime example and the awful creatures in the boiler room towards the end of the film for others. There's a lot of plot holes and the ending is decidedly weak but over all I really like the film. A lot of people say it's the worst of the series but in my opinion if you prefer number's 5 or 6 to this you are missing the point. I'll go out on a limb and say it's my personal favourite.7 ½ / 10",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Now I understand why it's the black sheep of the series. Sure because of its discontinuity with the original concept but also because this movie is such a crap fest. First, the acting is uninspired as it can be, the plot is non-engaging - presenting the ridiculous protagonist having his Freddy possessions here and there BUT why ""NOES part 2"" is such dismissed is mainly because it is filled with too much stupid ideas... the gym teacher attacked by basket and tennis balls, the EXPLODING parrot (no kidding), dogs with babies(?) faces, evil mice attacked by evil cats, and so on. And as many pointed it, this movie has a lot of gay references. Sure there's no real problem with that, in fact it's quite surprising to see a 80s horror flick more concerned with guys than gals. So talking about gay references, there's the butt slapping in the shower, the S&M bar, the constant state of ""no shirt-on"" of the main character, the eurodisco music at the party, the only loving scene interrupted by the urge to go see the male friend asleep in his bedroom, etcetera, etcetera.Actually, ""Freddy's Revenge"" is a must-see to all Z-movie lovers, cause it's damn funny.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
319,Badlands1,The meanest scariest Freddy ever.,10,25 October 2021,"Honestly when I saw this back in high school in the early 90s I was aware of some of the gay scenes, which didn't bug me as a straight man. Because I was acutely aware of this was definitely the meanest scariest Freddy out of the whole series.The make up is totally gruesome and evil looking. The soundtrack through the movie was so dark and grimy, and the special effects kills were just outstanding and still hold up today. I was never bored throughout the whole movie it had a really good plot. Some people might be upset that the dreamworld wasn't into effect. But that's the point of a series is to go new places.And honestly I love watching cheesy 80s high school scenes. Maybe the only thing is they could've thrown in more naked females to match the few gay scenes for all the people who strictly hated for the gay undertones. But I really think most people have never even watched the full movie. This was before Fredy started making jokes and wise cracks or had horrendous rubber like make up.

320,videtap,Freddy takes revenge softly,6,21 September 2010,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it was a cheesy follow-up to the First Nightmare, adapted to a more teenaged taste in its attempt to get a higher gross at the box office. The main failure for this film is to break the rules that make its predecessor so great: the leave out Freddy Krueger from its dreamland to the real world, turning him into an average psychopath and the movie itself into a conventional teen slasher, so the so much nightmarish imagery has no sense! In addition the story execution is sometimes boring, it seems that we are watching just an impertinent boy complaining and scream out loud like a girl than a group of friends suffering for dangerous nightmares. Anyway it is interesting to see for being the last time Krueger stops in the shadows, really frightening although far less than the 1st. The are some amazing scenes (the pool's party, the opening scene at the bus etc.) and the performances are good despite its even character development. The score is very good although I liked more the previous theme since it's the series signature music! Also interesting the supposed gay subtext (at least, the interpretations of some viewers agreeing that possibility seems to fit perfectly with the events of the film. In fact the main role played by Mark Patton looked very gay and I have heard the actor really is. That makes the movie a little more original.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
321,that_jed_guy,"You've got the body, I've got the brain",7,12 July 2012,"Most people would probably tell you that A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is one of the worst films in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, but to be honest it's actually grown on me after repeated viewings.Jesse is the new kid on Elm Street living with his parents and younger sister in the same house Nancy lived in from the first film and immediately he starts being tormented by Freddy Krueger in his dreams. However, instead of attempting to kill Jesse, Freddy regularly takes control of Jesse's mind and body to commit terror out of the dream world and in the real world. It reminds me of classic movies and stories like The Wolfman, and The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, but it can be confusing and most fans of the series will tell you that it breaks the rules of what can and can't happen in the Nightmare on Elm Street series.One of the main things people like to discuss about Freddy's Revenge is how homoerotic it is. Jesse is the only male lead in the entire series and he acts like a (fe)male in distress spending a lot of time literally screaming like a girl. There's a weird scene where he goes to a gay bar in the middle of the night for no reason at all and gets busted by his gym teacher (who happens to be gay). I won't say exactly what Freddy does to the gym teacher, but what I will say is that it's got balls...and towels. I'll also admit that there are also some other odd scenes that don't seem to make much sense too.What I like about Freddy's Revenge is that it's probably the scariest of the Nightmare sequels. The dialogue might be lame, but the main actors actually do a good job of acting terrified of Freddy who is still as twisted and intimidating as he was in the first film without being as comical as he was in the later sequels. Freddy is once again played by Robert Englund. Originally New Line Cinema had hired another actor to play Freddy, but the other actor was so terrible that they ended up bringing back Englund and from then he's played Freddy in all the sequels, including Wes Craven's New Nightmare and the crossover film, Freddy vs. Jason. He really is one of the greatest horror actors of all time.It may have its flaws, but overall I think that Freddy's Revenge is a really underrated sequel.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

323,murph-29724,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 why everything has been changed.,3,6 December 2015,"The number of Horror movies I've watched consists of movies made during my generation, never thinking that the older movies from the 80's or 90's would be Horrific at all. Watching A Nightmare on Elm's Street put that falsified thought process to shame. Like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Wes Craven's ability to have the viewers questioning at the first scene of the movie, leads you in knowing that this will be an intriguing film. Seeing that Wes Craven didn't direct this movie you can see the differences in why it didn't do as well.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge the sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street, makes some questionable changes to the original film: not only do all of the main character's change, and not only is the plot completely different, but Freddy Krueger's motives and abilities are fundamentally different from the original film. When you think of a sequel you think of the same characters, the same villain, and a twist that will differentiate it from the previous movies. Throughout all the Harry Potter movies the main characters stay the same, the Lord of the Ring movies have all the same main characters. Each movies plot changes a significant amount but it changes with the characters.A Nightmare on Elm Street challenges the progress of this franchise Freddy's motives and powers change. Freddy's motives in the first movie is to torment and pick off his victims one by one, in this movie he starts out only infiltrating the minds of the teenagers through there dreams; causing disorientation by him appearing in realistic scenarios, until he can take over there body. Freddy is the component of the dream that leaves you petrified and perplexed. Freddy, before he was burned to death, was a child serial killer who wants to continue his work. Once Freddy captures the character's mentality he feeds off the fear they have of him. Nancy is the only one capable of stopping Freddy, in the second movie Freddy's motives have become more physical. As Freddy torments Jesse in his dreams his vulnerability becomes Freddy's access point to his body, abusing it to get his dirty work done. Freddy is able to control Jesse, soon enough he is able to take over Jesse's body. No longer is he just trying to pick off his victims in there nightmares he is wanting to take over Jesse's body to murder people in the real world. Throughout the horror franchise we see the powers and motives of villains increase as sequels continue to be made.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge challenges the expectations that the horror franchise has built for decades. The change in this movie is significant enough that if you were to watch this movie without watching the first Nightmare on Elm Street you would be able to follow along. With the change in characters and plot you wouldn't have ever known that the first one was made. The deviation of continuity in the first movie to the sequel seems to be broken, small similarities keep it going but even Freddy was changed which was the biggest effect on its continuity.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Part 2 is also scarier and has better acting. Heather Langenkamp is good in the first one, but overall, 2 is superior in acting and in creep effect. It has a darker storyline, and the two lead actors Mark Patton and Kim Myers are very good in adding to the overall creepiness of the story with their very convincing performances. I think Part 2 is the scariest of all seven of the Nightmare movies - but, on an overall objective scale, New Nightmare is probably the best-made of them all...

This is an interesting idea, but it creates a very average, maybe even sub-average horror film. The movie only has one true standout scene, where Freddy terrorizes the pool party. The male lead was uninteresting and I didn't really seem to care about his problems. Heather Langenkamp pulled off ""disturbed teen with nightmares who everyone thinks is crazy"" very well in the original Nightmare movie, but the actor in this film does not. The ending, with ""I love you Jessie!"" killing Fred was kind of a let down too.4 out of 10, because the scene where Freddy terrorizes the party is cool and they didn't try and be a bigger version of the original, but the movie they made just isn't that good.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge

Even if it was unintentional (according to director Jack Sholder) I didn't 'intend' to see horror movie classic monster, Freddy Krueger star in such a disgraceful flick to the series, or see one of the characters that Jesse kills nude. The first movie was INCREDIBLE, probably the best in the series because it didn't need special effects or anything high-tech it just was naturally frightening. In the second film they attempt to use special effects and fail, in the third film they use special effects to their fullest extent and create a very good movie also scary in some scenes. The second will be nothing more than a comedy to me.I would just skip this movie, if I must go into more detail why you should, I'll gladly tell you. 1.Nancy is absent through the whole movie. 2. The movie gets off on a bad start (Jesse is a creep riding on a school bus with two other girls, the school bus driver misses the stop, rides off into a sort of desert and stays there. Gradually, land falls off beneath them until the school bus is remaining on a single piece of land. Freddy reveals himself and fights them as they try to balance themselves. Jesse wakes up screaming and sweating, you can see what a crappy job they did on the whole scene.),middle(just about everything)and end(They are back on the bus going to school and Jesse gets worried, he screams ""Stop you're going too fast!"" his friend reassures him in the worst acting ever. She says ""Its OK Jesse everything is going to be alright"" at least I think thats what she says. Then there is a skip and Freddy's glove has magically came out of her chest and she starts screaming.) 3.

And once in the movie (not a spoiler) He gets out of bed,and walks to a gay bar in the rain....why?...just cause...he then gets sent to school by his gay smn couch to do laps and take a shower......wait..what? yes. this film is HORRIBLE. it will insult fans till the day they die and is just not fun to watch even in the sense of a movie so bad,its hilarious,its just bad and unfun this is a movie worth of a score of -1/100. I hate this movie. and happy Halloween",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
332,Joe-w-731-119514,Underrated.. Please give it a go,7,6 May 2010,"A nightmare on elm street 2 is often recognised as a weak entry in the series... Granted it's not as good as the original but it stays true to what Wes Craven wanted Freddy to be; A dark, mysterious killer.. Not a games show host.. And lets be honest, it puts later entries like part 5 to shame. First I'll talk about the new main victim, admittedly it was a bit of a shock to not see the return of Nancy.. But being an entirely different film, I think it works to have an entirely different main character. ""Jesse,"" who is definitely a weaker more troubled individual is played by underground actor ""Mark Patton"" who does an amazing job Imo. You believe he is terrified of what's happening to him, never does he try to be a hero and have an action sequence with Freddy, that was left for the sequels, this is all about Freddy being the predator and the kid being the prey.. Jesse is only tormented and victimised and every scream is believable. Although he is shockingly isolated by his parents who blame drugs or insanity, Jesse's girlfriend Lisa played by Kim Myers is supportive towards Jesse and helps him discover more about Freddy and help him out, again I think this is a good acting performance. As for Freddy, it appears, like part 1, his aim is to scare and kill, not entertain us with jokes.. Not that his later character development was a problem, I just definitely prefer the darker Freddy. As for the plot, Freddy now wants to come into the real world using Jesse as a host to possess.. This may make the film visually seem a lot less surreal and possibly less creative due to cutting out a lot of dream sequences.. This can be seen as a major flaw to the audience but I can also take this in a positive way. What is lost here with visual horror, is amplified with psychological horror. We've seen what happens in the dreams in the prequel, we know Freddy is terrifying in nightmares, ""dont fall asleep"" we understand, yes it's a very fresh idea and yes there was a lot of interesting ideas that could be used for more death dream scenes, but the director, named ""Jack Sholder,"" wants to take Freddy in a different direction, not terrorising a group of teenagers with nightmares and gruesome deaths but aiming for one unfortunate victim with nightmares, twisting with his thoughts, blurring his realisation of dreams and the real world and making him madly insane. And I'm open to try experimental ideas. Freddy succeeds in a few murders this way.. First of all in the less memorable scene with Schneider, which was just plain weird and confusing I thought.. But secondly against who appears to be Jesses only male friend ""Ron"" where he is locked in his own room with a mutating Jesse.. This scene is among my top fav Freddy kills in the series.. You know what I mean, and I bet you haven't forgot about it neither.The ending is nothing special, but it works.. Again Freddys death is achieved by a female character ""Lisa"".. Who emotionally destroys Freddy revealing her love, Jesse.. And no surprise after what you believe is a happy ending it reveals this is not end of Freddy.. He will be back again and again and again. Overall I'd give this film an 7.5 out of 10.. Not as fresh, creative nor iconic as the original, but more dark, twisted and evil....",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
333,user-785-694798,Roki Reviews: NOAS Part 2: Freddy's Revenge,6,7 July 2010,"Freddy's Revenge - the second (and commonly regarded as the worst) part of the Nightmare on Elm Street series is underrated. Continuing the tale of Freddy Krueger, a burned man wearing a glove with knives replacing the nails who kills people in their dreams, the setting takes place in the same house on Elm Street that Nancy lived in during the first part. The story takes place 5 years after the final events of the first part. Apparently, a new family has moved into Nancy's house – a teenager named Jesse Walsh, his parents and his younger sister. Jesse lives his life as most teenagers do, until he starts dreaming about Freddy Krueger. Soon enough, Jesse finds Nancy's diary that she apparently wrote during the first part of the series. There she explains her adventures, as Jesse starts to suspect that Krueger is not merely a part of his imagination. Jesse soon realizes that Freddy is killing people all around him by using his body, putting the blame on him. Jesse now has to fight Krueger who will stop at nothing to get his revenge on the children of Elm Street.Freddy's Revenge may very well be the darkest part of the series. There are often references to homosexuality and the audience has to live through the pain that Jesse feels as Krueger uses his body as a killing tool. The effects are better in this film than in the first part, making the images even more disturbing. The deaths are less creative in this film then in the other parts, but they are truly ruthless. The transformation that Jesse goes through is very graphic and creepy. Due to the gory moments and the tension that you feel between the kills, this movie is truly scary.Robert Englund seems to have grown into his role after the first film, as he does an even more astounding job in Part 2. The other actors are rather bad, but they do not ruin the film as in some other movies. Mark Patton (Jesse) seems to have some talent as he is able to portray the pain that Jesse goes through.Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge may not be as good as the first part, but it is definitely underrated - I would give it a 6/10.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
334,conorreeves822,A Poor Sequel,4,3 July 2012,"In 1984, a movie by the name of A Nightmare on Elm Street was released, it took the horror genre by storm, and quickly became a commercial and critical success. Because of the high praise and scoring of $25 million at the box office, a sequel was inevitable.As you well know, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge is the second instalment in the Elm Street franchise, what you may not know is that it may also be the worst. For a start, a big part of the movies, dreams, are stuffed into the corner. Replaced with some bizarre plot about possession that really doesn't belong in this series. The acting is okay, though, so is the script, but the movie is COMPLETELY devoid of scares.One thing that I have to point out in this review is the parrot scene. Yes, THAT parrot scene. For a movie that takes itself so seriously, it's hard to think that they would this in. The subtext isn't helping either.Overall: A disappointing followup that even Englund's performance can't save, Freddy's Revenge will hold you for a minute, before you start wanting to see him go slash-happy with his glove on some bystanders.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
335,spiritaurawolf,"Not As Good as it could have been...I don't think this contains spoilers, but just in case...",6,5 April 2005,"Okay, don't get me wrong, I am a ""Nightmare"" fanatic. But I think the lack of having Wes Craven as a director really hurt this movie, making it slightly worse than the original. The acting was slightly decent, however, the performances of Robert Englund as Freddy and Mark Patton as Jesse were exceptional. The movie, in itself, ""ruined"" our image of Freddy from the last film. Where did all his snappy one-liners go, eh? And more of the focus was Jesse, when it should have explain more of what Freddy intended, hence, the plot. The effects were decent for the times, but by today's standards would be considered quite cheap. There also could have been more establishing dialouge between Jesse and Lisa, to justify their emotions. On the whole, I found it rather disappointing from the original. Fans are bound to be disappointed.",A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 - Freddy's Revenge
