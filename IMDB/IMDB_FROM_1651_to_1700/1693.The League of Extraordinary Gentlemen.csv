0,MartinHafer,Great if you want a film that is all action and very little else.,3,7 June 2021,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is a notorious film. Critics hated it, audiences avoided it and Sean Connery credits it for his retirement from movies. Is it really that bad? Well, yes....and no. How bad the film is and how difficult it is to watch really depends on you. If you want an action picture that is all action and the plot and dialog are really not that important, you'll enjoy the film. If you want a film with a decent plot and characters who talk like people, then you better just find another movie. In this sense, it really is dopey.So what do you want in a film? Do you want lots of action and amazing CGI for its time or do you want a film about people and with a decent plot and dialog? Much of the film ignores the actual story arcs for the characters. Few of the legendary characters in the movie act or seem like their fictional versions from literature and previous movies...more like cartoon versions of them. As for me, I found it incredibly boring as opposed to being bad...boring because the characters just seemed like caricatures.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
1,bkoganbing,In Her Majesty's Service,9,28 November 2006,"I've found it fascinating over the past 20 years that with the advances made in special effects techniques, comic book heroes have had an explosion in popularity on the screen. The films, good, bad or indifferent seem to make money with a built in market. We seem to get a few of them every year with accompanying merchandise.One I liked very much was based on the idea of combining a whole bunch of literary characters from the 19th century into The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen. Some heroes, some villains, some troubled people all get together in the service of the British Empire to find out just who wants to brew a lot of trouble among the European Powers.It's quite a crew they've assembled, Allen Quatermaine, Mina Harker, Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and his alter ego Mr. Hyde, and visiting from America Tom Sawyer. They're in for some high adventure, the kind kids eagerly used to read about in the books these people are found in.The League of Extraordinary Gentleman has a kind of infectious charm that I find irresistible. A lot of that has to do with Sean Connery as Allen Quartermaine, fresh from the continent of Africa, and leader of this band. As of today, this film has been the last screen appearance of the man some word argue is the biggest international star the movies have right now. I particularly like the scenes that Connery has with Shane West who plays Special Agent Tom Sawyer of the United States Secret Service. I'll bet you didn't know where Tom Sawyer would wind up when he grew up and left the Mississippi. Seems perfectly logical watching this film. Quartermaine lost a son and buried two wives and he bonds with young Sawyer. He even warns him against romancing Mina Harker, played by Peta Wilson whose vampiric proclivities might be a bit much for a young man to handle.I'm sure The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen got a lot of young viewers going to see it. If any of them get curious enough to read the books these characters are found in, than this film will have done a great service. By the way, the chief villain when he's unmasked is yet another villain found in a series of classic books from that time period and one of the recruited league in fact is a traitor.I won't say, you'll have to buy or rent the video/DVD.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
2,Leofwine_draca,A mish-mash of tired action and cheap effects,4,18 August 2016,"It took me a while to get around to watching this movie purely because of all the negative press surrounding it. In the end, I saw it was on TV and I decided to finally give it a go; I'm glad now that I never spent money to watch it. For all the lack of credibility, the silliness and the poor plotting, the thing that really sinks this film is the CGI work. There are tons of effects shots and what not and none of them are very credible, whether it be the image of Venice sinking or Captain Nemo's massive submarine rising from the ocean depths. All of these bits look just like what they are: cartoon creations, two dimensional and void.Still, I ended up enjoying the film on a minor level, mainly thanks to the impressive acting of Sean Connery. The ex-Bond, who publicly quit acting after his troubles during making this film (a whole other story) puts in a strong, steel-willed turn as Allan Quartermain, H. Rider Haggard's literary hero. He's tough, believable and, most importantly, charismatic. He runs rings around the other characters in the movie, although to be fare none of them are fleshed out as much as he is. Shah is a one dimensional Captain Nemo, an Indian martial arts master with no unique features; Peta Wilson is Mina Harker from Dracula, yet she's in no way convincing as a vampire – far too cold and unlovely. Shane West is the imported American actor, a grab for US audiences, but he seems out of his 'league', while the worst actor by far is Stuart Townsend. I just felt this guy was vain and unlikable, and I'm not sure how much of that was acting. Jason Flemyng is always good value but he has little to do here as Dr Jekyll, while Richard Roxburgh plays a one-dimensional character as best he can.This is a film that works best in the dialogue scenes – unusually. That's because the action scenes are a poorly-edited mess, using that annoying tactic of repeatedly cutting from one battle to another and back again. It's all fancy manoeuvres and footwork, restrained by a kid-friendly rating, and it's the same tired stuff that Hollywood's been serving up for years. Out of all the effects in the film, the only one I liked was Mr Hyde, coming across as a Victorian version of The Incredible Hulk. There are a handful of moments I enjoyed – Dorian Gray's demise being one of them – but they're definitely outweighed by all the flaws elsewhere. Not a film worth spending money to see.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
3,SnoopyStyle,Too many extraordinary gentlemen,6,13 April 2014,"It's 1899 and the world is about to be revolutionized by new and more powerful weapons. The Phantom attacks the great powers of the world threatening to start a world war as the great powers blame each other for the attacks. Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is recruited along with other heroes of the era to solve the mystery.From graphic novels, this has good potential for this idea of literary heroes of a past era. Sean Connery is good as essentially an older Bond. The others aren't as compelling. The fact that there are so many of them may have something to do with it. If the movie could concentrate on fewer characters, the story could be improved and the audience could invest more in each character. The action and effects are reasonably for the time. There is a Victorian style to it all. The group chemistry never really gel and the movie needs that to work badly. I am reminded of how MCU and DCCU are building up their world. This is like leading with Justice League or The Avengers as their first movie.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
4,claudio_carvalho,"Good Cast, Idea and Effects, in a Movie That Does Not Work Well",6,26 December 2003,"In 1899, almost simultaneously, England is attacked by German and vice-versa. The European continent is close to the war due to these events. A group of heroes  Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), the vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), the Invisible Man Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), the American Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng)  are invited by M (Richard Roxburgh) to gather and form the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Their objective would be fighting against Phantom, the mentor of the aggressions in Europe. Although having good cast and special effects, this movie fails.

5,nogodnomasters,CALL ME ISHMAEL,8,16 June 2019,"This is a superhero movie that takes place in 1899 utilizing numerous fictional characters from that era, some more obscure than others. The main character, Allan Quatermain, played by Sean Connery, would become the model for Indiana Jones. The movie takes some liberties with the characters. For instance Mr. Hyde has been transformed into ""The Hulk."" There is a list of fine actors which in itself makes the movie a worth while view. Even the minor characters are names from old novels.The fighting and action lack much of that special CG effect of bullet dodging and gravity defying martial art moves.The movie is fairly plain and straight forward with a twist, but not complex . Certainly a worth while view if you either like Marvel/DC comic heroes or are just a fan of 19th century literature.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Lots of killing, minimum blood/gore. Some sexual innuendos in the dialouge. MAKES FOR AN EXCELLENT FAMILY RENTAL if you don't mind a little violence/killing.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
6,kosmasp,"Troubled (""Gentle"")men",7,14 December 2020,"Most of the characters here are anything but Gentle ... but then again, if you think about how troubled the production was (how come there is no behind the scenes documentary?), the end result could have been a lot worse. Don't get me wrong: considering the characters put into the mix here, this could have been a really great movie too. But its too muddled, CGI has aged badly, acting and story choices are predictable and sometimes just plain bad ... but you can overlook these if you want to.And it's imperative to do so, if you like to be entertained by it. Because the movie is fun overall. And has a great cast ... even if this was unfortunately the last outing of Sean Connery ... that must have been an epic fight/battle on set with the director if it made him quit the business ... sadly. Now that he passed away he can't even be asked about it. Although I do think he never wanted to talk about it in the first place, so there is that.Some sexism (or inappropriate behavior I reckon some would call it) and other odd choices might take the fun away for some ... understandable ... just don't try to overthink it ... if you can",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
7,classicsoncall,"""Leave one alive to tell the tale.""",7,6 May 2006,"Set in a literary world, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" brings together classic fictional characters in a globe spanning adventure. However the film suffers, in my estimation, from trying to be the greatest action adventure of all time. Had the film makers spent more time on character development and motivation, the picture might have salvaged it's most intriguing premise, the team up of disparate personalities to defeat a megalomaniac who threatens the world.Interestingly, the single character that is most sorely missed and needed in the band of heroes is the great detective Sherlock Holmes. Granted, he was not a principal in the comic book series of Alan Moore, but since the man behind 'M' the Phantom was Holmes' arch nemesis, Professor Moriarty, it would only have made sense for them to match wits one more time. True to form though, Moriarty dies in the film, which he did in at least three different Sherlock Holmes movies of an earlier era.Having seen the film during it's original theatrical run, I managed to catch it today on the cable FX channel. What made it more interesting this time around was the inclusion of deleted scenes and commentary about how certain scenes were filmed. What many would perceive as CGI at work, for example the destruction of Venice, was actually done with a miniature set built to one fifth scale. The buildings took four months to build to architectural precision, and another two months were taken for the filming of the action scenes, including the vehicle race through the (non existent) streets of Venice. At least if one has a problem with the story, some appreciation for the effort is in order.When I first heard about LXG being made into a movie, I had a confident hope that it would do the original Alan Moore concept justice, though I might have known better. It's probably best to go into the film cold with no expectations. If you enjoy over the top action, Hulk like monster metamorphosis, vampire lore and massive destruct sequences, there's some excitement here for you. Don't get too worked up though for intrigue, suspense and mystery; there's too much in your face action going on to get in the way.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
8,jboothmillard,The League of Extraordinary,3,31 October 2006,"I remember seeing this once before, I gave it a very low rating, but my review for it was not very good; the excuse to watch it again and get a better opinion it is that it was the 90th birthday of its leading actor, based on the comic book, directed by Stephen Norrington (Blade). Basically, set in 1899, Leonardo da Vinci's blueprints of Venice's foundations are stolen from the Bank of England, and several German scientists are kidnapped, by a terrorist group led by the Fantom. Sanderson Reed (Tom Goodman-Hill) is sent by the British Empire to Kenya Colony to recruit adventurer and hunter Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), who retired following the death of his son. Quatermain initially refuses until a group of assassins attempt to kill him, resulting in the death of his long-time friend, Nigel (David Hemmings). In London, Quatermain meets ""M"" (Moulin Rouge's Richard Roxburgh), who explains that the Fantom plans to start a world war by bombing a secret meeting of world leaders in Venice. To prevent this plot, M wants to recruit a team of men and women with superhuman abilities. One by one, the ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is formed, starting with seafarer and inventor Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), invisible thief Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran) (The Invisible Man), and vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) (Dracula). The ageless and invincible Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) (The Picture of Dorian Gray), also Mina's former lover, is recruited at the London docks. They are also joined by American Secret Service Agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West) (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn), after helping them fend off an attack by the Fantom's assassins. Finally, the dangerous split personality of Dr Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng) (Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde) is recruited in Paris, France. The League travels to Venice in Nemo's submarine, the Nautilus, but there is a mole aboard, and Skinner is the prime suspect. The Nautilus arrives in Venice, but they are too late to stop the bomb exploding, causing the city to collapse. Sawyer uses Nemo's automobile to stop the destruction, while Quatermain fights the Fantom, who is unmasked and revealed to be M. It is also revealed that Dorian is the traitor; he murders Nemo's first mate Ishmael (Terry O'Neill) and escapes in an exploration pod. M and Dorian leave a phonograph recording for the League revealing their plan to ignite the world war, and that Dorian has been collecting physical elements of the League to create a heavily armed version of the Nautilus, invisible spies, vampire assassins, and Hyde-like soldiers, and to sell the superhuman formulas off to the high bidders. The Nautilus is bombed from the inside, but Hyde saves it from flooding. Skinner sends a message to the League, revealing he is aboard the exploration pod and tells them to follow him. The League reunite with Skinner in northern Mongolia and plan to destroy M's factory with explosives. Nemo and Hyde rescue the scientists, Skinner sets the explosive charges, and Mina battles and eventually kills Dorian by exposing him to his missing portrait, the source of his immortality. Quatermain and Sawyer confront M, identifying him as Professor James Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes's archenemy who changed his identity following his supposed death at the Reichenbach Falls. Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed, who Quatermain shoots, only to be fatally stabbed by Moriarty. Sawyer successfully shoots Moriarty when he tries to flee, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies. Quatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members depart, agreeing to continue using their powers for good in the new century. After they leave, the Witch (Semere-Ab Etmet Yohannes) the League had talked about arrives and performs a ritual that causes a storm and a bolt of lightning to strike Quatermain's grave. Also starring Max Ryan as Dante, and Rudolf Pellar as Draper. Connery is charismatic as the fearless human leader, and the supporting cast playing famous contemporary fantasy, science fiction, and adventure characters all do fine, there is no denying that the fast-paced chase and fight sequences are exciting enough, and most (not all) of the special effects are good, but it is predictable and silly, this was Connery's final film before his retirement (most likely because of the negativity it got), but it it is not the most terrible fantasy adventure. Adequate!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
9,ccthemovieman-1,Turned Out To Be The Minor League,4,6 October 2006,"I should have really liked this movie, but it did nothing for me. I enjoy films with characters that have super-human powers, and this has a bunch of them. I usually enjoy Sean Connery's films. This has both, so what's the problem?I'm not exactly sure, except I know I never got involved enough to care about any of these characters, which is important. Connery just didn't have his normal spark, either, although he was all right.The special-effects were a bit disappointing, too. Sometimes they were great; other times they looked hokey. In this day-and-age, they should NEVER look hokey.I gave this two chances but didn't even finish it the second time. What a disappointment.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
10,rmax304823,A Veritable Orgy of CGIs.,5,6 July 2012,"I think this is what's known in the trade as a ""high concept"" movie. Let's bring together a band of fictional characters who might have actually been found on the streets of Victorian England and have them try to achieve an almost impossible goal. The goal here is to prevent a menacing figure called The Phantom from blowing up the city of Venice and precipitating a world war.The notables are duly rounded up and assigned the mission by a British official named ""M"". That must have given Sean Connery a chuckle. Connery is Allan Quatermain, great white hunter and central figure in H. Rider Haggard's novels such as ""King Solomon's Mines."" Captain Nemo is Jules Verne's contribution, skipper of a highly advanced submarine and other items of technology. He's introduced for some reason as a Sikh. I guess the reason for his Orientality is that he's able to deploy some chop socky skills during the frequent fist fights and shoot outs.The Invisible Man has a working-class accent and makes numerous remarks designed to be funny. Dorian Gray, of course, is the famous creation of Oscar Wilde. While everyone else darts around, Gray simply walks through action scenes like the immortal dandy he is. Tom Sawyer, now a fully grown young man, is an agent of the US Secret Service. He carries multiple six shooters and a Winchester rifle. Stevenson's Mister Hyde is monstrous, ugly, and mean, but Dr. Jeykll is a timorous coward. Mina Harker may be remembered as the wife of the frightened hero of Stoker's ""Dracula."" Her specialty is turning into a bat and tearing people's throats out.Well, I'll tell you. There's one CGI-influenced action scene after another. The production design is as impressive as that Batman movie -- all big city landscapes with tall, gloomy, ornate buildings. If there was more than one or two daytime scenes, I missed them.But why bother with the plot? Why bother with character? Nothing really fits together. The thrill is in watching all the destruction that takes place, and a new explosion of violence takes place every five minutes. Watch half of Venice being blown to pieces.Here's how you know you're in an action movie. Look for three quick sequential shots. A man is going to drive a car away -- fast. Shot one: his hand jams the gear shift into its proper niche. Shot two: a shoe stomping on the accelerator. Shot three: the tires spin and smoke as the car leaps away at warp speed. Of course an action movie also requires a lot of ugly automatic weapons but there were none in 1910, so they had to be introduced from the future.The evil mastermind turns out to be Professor Moriarty.Ho hum.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
11,ma-cortes,Exciting and stimulating adventures and science fiction movie,7,7 June 2005,"The picture is developed about a fictitious Victorian Age epoch in a alternate European world war . In Venice there's a worldwide congress , the leaders are threaten and a motley group of literature heroes are called to avoid it ; thus , there appear : Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) of the book , King Solomon's Mines (H.R.Haggard) ; Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde (Jason Fleming) of Robert Louis Stevenson ; captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Sha) of 20.000 leagues of underwater journey by Jules Verne ; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) of Dracula by Bram Stoker ; Dorian Gray (Stuart Towsend) by Oscar Wilde , Tom Sawyer (Shane West) of Mark Twain and even a Ismael (Terry O'Neill) of Moby Dick (Herman Melville) and Dr.Moriarty of Sherlock Holmes' books by Arthur Conan Doyle .The film is based on a comic by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill where are the same personages but has been added Tom Sawyer for being an American production although it has been also produced by Sean Connery who has got the greatest role . Apart from the 19th Century characters used in the film, this goes for some Golden Age comic book characters . The motion picture blends suspense , action packed , tension , emotions and a little bit of violence when the struggles happen , but it's a pretty bemusing movie . The ending confrontation in the fortress amongst the protagonists and the nasty enemies is breathtaking and overwhelming . The pic is very spectacular with numerous special effects (FX) and groundbreaking scenarios . Trevor Jones music is atmospheric and adjusted to the unstopped action movie . The film was rightly directed by Stephen Norrington (Blade) . Rating : Good and nice . Well worth watching.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
12,BA_Harrison,"A noisy, chaotic mess",3,26 April 2014,"In an alternate Victorian world, a group of classic literary characters team up to try and stop an evil arms manufacturer from starting a world war for profit.Adapted from Alan Moore's graphic novel, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a loud, chaotic mess of a movie, director Stephen Norrington handling proceedings with all the finesse of a rampaging Dr. Hyde. People fight, stuff blows up, guns blaze, buildings collapse, but somehow it all proves surprisingly boring.All the steam-punk styling and flashy CGI effects in the world wouldn't disguise the fact that this is a frequently incoherent, unevenly paced piece of big-budget Hollywood nonsense that stumbles awkwardly from one tedious, dingy, poorly edited action scene to another. Compelling drama and genuine excitement never enter the equation.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
13,Quinoa1984,"not awful, but not very good either: a droll actioneer with lots of bang and little heart",4,29 July 2009,"There is at least one good reason why Alan Moore doesn't like his works to be made into films. In this case, the characters and set-ups and specific intentions with it being a comic-book shouldn't be screwed around and tossed about by Sean Connery and the wonderfully dumb chums at 20th Century Fox (i.e. Tom Rothman). It's also very hard, after reading Moore and Kevin O'Neill's clever work of genius (if not on the level of Watchmen and V For Vendetta pretty close), not to recollect to that when watching Stephen Norrington's translation. Most of the words are there, in means of bringing the characters on to the screen, more or less (less being twisting with some of the traits like Nina Harker actually being a vampire in the film as opposed to not at all in the book, or 'the' Invisible Man being not a scum-sort as in the book), plus some new ones like Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray. But the music isn't there; the self-referential humor and true wicked British wit and hard edged style has been replaced. It is, for lack of a better term, 'Hollywoodized'.This means that there is action, and lots of it. Norrington may have been attempting to top his previous effort with Blade, and instead just goes overboard. The CGI, such as in seemingly simple things like the underwater scenes with the Nautilus, or those sweeping shots through Venice during the explosions, are only passably effective at best and at worst look like Sci-Fi channel garbage. The dialog has the sort of tinge to it that Hollywood people love: not too dumb, but not really with the sort of kick that goes too far off of the conventional path. Connery seems to be fine with this, and why not? A mega-star in his 70s wants to be comfortable, and that is part of the problem. Aside from the quibbles one could have from looking at the comics and then at the movie (I can have quite a few, just with the casting, but also with characterizations), as a movie it just has that sin that Capra talked about: boredom.The storytelling isn't even too horrible, and you can watch it without ever being too confused, but it also never jumps out and makes you really think either. It's a PG-13 summer blockbuster, and those first two things don't really match up with what Moore and O'Neill intended with their series. The premise is so ideal for a movie, and it's not out of reach that a decent, or even very good, movie could have been made out of materials of a group of famous literary creations of the late 19th century- Quarterman, Jekyll/Hyde, Harker, Sawyer (an addition to the movie that is half welcome half meh), Captain Nemo- going on adventures against other literary creations. The first half hour promises a classy, if shallow and violent, spectacle with plenty of one-liners and good stars to look at.There is some of that, but then there's also the lack of soul, nothing really beating as it lumbers on, and the action scenes start to blur together really. And there's problems that arise after a while in simple things: where's the flow from dialog (often workable but very clichéd and without any reality past the ""movieness"" of it) to the action scenes? Some of it does look creative, such as when Hyde has to face off against a gigantic being who's swallowed far too much of Jekyll's concoction. But after so much of it, and things that just make your eyes roll (Quartermain schools Sawywer how to shoot, so original), you just don't really care much anymore. It's not the worst comic-book movie ever, but it is certainly one of the most formulaic. The craftsmanship is there, and everything could fall into place. It just doesn't. Score one, if only really one, for Alan Moore vs cinema versions of his masterpieces. 4.5/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
14,BandSAboutMovies,So much could have been,3,22 April 2020,"Sean Connery turned down the roles of the Architect in The Matrix films and Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. He would have made $450 million off that last role, so that led to him taking this movie, even though he didn't understand the script. But hey - $17 million makes things much simpler, right?He warred with director Stephen Norrington (Death Machine, Blade), who was uncomfortable with large crews. It makes sense, as Norrington came up from working with special effects on movies like Split Second and Aliens. For what it's worth, Norrington did not attend the premiere, and when he was asked where the director was, Connery is said to have replied, ""Check the local asylum.""Jason Flemyng, who played Dr. Jekyll in the film, told Empire, ""My favorite bust-up was in Venice. The League had to walk from Captain Nemo's boat down the street, Magnificent Seven-style. At the end of the take, Sean shouted to Norrington, 'What? You want us to do that again?' He replied, ""For $18 million, I don't think it's too much to ask you to walk down a road."" To which Connery's reply was unprintable.""Since this film, Norrington has been attached to several projects but hasn't made another film, claiming that he would never direct again.Interestingly enough, Larry Cohen and Martin Poll filed a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming the company had intentionally plagiarized their script Cast of Characters, which the two had pitched to Fox several times. But wait - isn't this movie based on the Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill comic book?Cohen and Poll claimed that the studio bought the rights as a smoke screen, as both their script and the final movie shared public domain characters who did not appear in the comic book series.The case was settled out of court, a decision Alan Moore told the New York Times was upsetting, as he had ""been denied the chance to exonerate himself."" No wonder the guy hates the movies made from his comic books so much.In 1899, Fantomas (Richard Roxburgh, Van Helsing) and his army have broken into the Bank of England to steal da Vinci's blueprints of Venice and kidnap several scientists. To figure out what is happening, Allan Quatermain (Connery) is brought back to for a new team of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, along with Captain Nemo, vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson from the TV version of La Femme Nikita), invisible man Rodney Skinner (the production couldn't get the rights to the original story, so they made up their own invisible person), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend, Queen of the Damned), Tom Sawyer and the twin form of Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde.Whereas the comic showed the league battling Martians and Fu Manchu, instead of the revelation that M - yes, like the Bond films - is also Fantomas and Sherlock Holmes' archenemy Professor James Moriarty. Like they say, this is loosely based on the source material.David Hemmings shows up as Ishmael, which is a nice cameo. The effects are big and bold, while the movie sets up a sequel at the end. That never happened - this is another one of those ""even though the movie made $179.3 million on a $78 million budget"" movies that still isn't a success. Hollywood math.The character of Campion Bond, British Intelligence Director - and the ancestor of James Bond - was supposed to appear and be played by Sir Roger Moore. The character was dropped before filming began to be saved for a possible sequel, which was never made.Despite only a few references to Tom Sawyer in the comic books, the character was added to appeal to young Americans, which upset many fans of the comic, as well as Moore and O'Neill. That said, Mark Twain wrote two little-known sequels to Tom Sawyer, is Jules Verne-like one called Tom Sawyer Abroad and another where he becomes Tom Sawyer, Detective.O'Neill would later say that he believed this movie failed because it was not respectful of the source material, such as how Allan Quatermain was changed so much and that Mina Murray was marginalized by becoming a vampire.The Wold Newton family - a literary concept derived from a form of crossover fiction developed by the American science fiction writer Philip Jose Farmer - is a great concept. The comic takes full advantage of this. The movie ended a director's career and retired Connery from anything other than voice-over work.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
15,sunwarrior13,Just Ordinary,8,16 October 2012,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a film adaptation loosely based on characters from the comic book limited series of the same title by Alan Moore.It is an action adventure film set in the late 19th century, featuring an assortment of fictional literary characters appropriate to the period, who act as Victorian Era superheroes. It draws on the works of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, H. Rider Haggard, Ian Fleming, Herman Melville, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Allan Poe, Gaston Leroux, and Mark Twain.The movie has an ensemble cast that includes Sean Connery, Naseeruddin Shah, Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng, and Richard Roxburgh.It is directed by Stephen Norrington.Queen Victoria assembled a team of evil-fighting heroes. Among them are Allan Quatermain from H.

Wells book of the same name; and several others. Working together, the odd assortment of characters must combine their powers to defeat a mysterious villain and save the world from certain destruction. Hardly an original plot, but perhaps that's fitting for a movie sewn together like Frankenstein's monster. The movie rushes from one frenetic battle to another, replacing sense with spectacle such as Nemo's submarine rising from the water, a warehouse full of zeppelins bursting into flame and Venice collapsing into its own canals.Without a strong, juicy villain,it lacks an important ingredient.Added to that,it is flashy and completely incoherent.Too bad that the film just managed to be ordinary.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

17,preppy-3,Turn off your mind and you'll enjoy it,7,19 July 2003,"A bunch of fictional characters (Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Allan Quatermain, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer) are called together in 1899 to combat a madman who threatens to take over the world.The plot is silly and full of huge holes (Mina Harker was NOT a vampire; Tom Sawyer working for the U.S. government?; Mr. Hyde looks like a cousin to the Hulk; Dorian Gray is an immortal?) but the movie itself looks great, there are plenty of incredible special effects (and, surprisingly, some bad ones) and it moves so quickly that you really don't have time to stop and think about it.  Just ignore logic, plot and characterizations, lean back and let the movie sweep over you.  There's a fight or action scene every 5 or 10 minutes or so--you won't be bored.All the acting is pretty good--Connery is excellent (as always) as Quatermain and Peta Wilson makes a very sexy vampire.  The only bad acting comes surprisingly from two good actors--Stuart Townsend is very dull as Dorian Grey and Shane West is way out of his league as Tom Sawyer.  The scenes between him and Connery are almost embarassing to watch--Connery is acting rings around him.So--is it a good movie?  No, but it is an enjoyable one.  Just sit back and don't think about--during or after the movie!  Good viewing for a hot summer afternoon.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
18,LeonLouisRicci,and a Lady Vampire,7,19 January 2014,"Ambitious Flop that Virtually Everyone Hated. But it is not all that. The Movie is a Noble Failure that Attempts to Recycle some of those Fantastical Fictional Literary Icons of the Nineteenth Century B.C. (Before Comics).That alone was Somewhat Daring considering that just about Anyone Under the Age of 100 might have only Read the Books at the point of a Teacher's Ruler. But if you are going to do this Thing it might be Wise to give the Characters a bit of Charisma. After all, they haven't stayed in Print this Long because they are Boring.Not that the Movie is Boring it is just that League is brought Together On Screen with so Little Depth. The Film's Strength is Audacity and Sheen, Costumes and a Blistering Pace. The Design is Impressive and the 2003 CGI, while Again Overused, is kinda Cool.It is Possible that Perhaps this will be a bit of a Welcomed Surprise because Expectations are so Low. Recommended because it is Offbeat if nothing Else and in the End it is Worth a Watch for what Might Have Been as much as for What It Is.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
19,poolandrews,"""Is the Vampiric sucking of blood radical?"" Decent big budget adventure.",6,23 October 2006,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is set in the year 1899 in an alternate reality where a shadowy figure known as The Phantom is staging unprecedented acts of violence against nations across Europe in a bid to start a war between them & sell his highly advanced arms & weapons to the highest bidders, simple right? Well no not really because the British government agent known as 'M' (Richard Roxburgh) has been busy assembling the league of extraordinary gentlemen, a collection of some the most unique & talented individuals that live including famed adventurer & leader of the league Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery who executive produced as well). Along side him are Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), the immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), slinky female vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), the invisible Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), Dr. Henry Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) & his alter-ego Edward Hyde & American secret service agent Tom Saywer (Shane West) who are all ready to go into battle & use their individual abilities to defeat The Phantom & prevent a world war...Directed by Stephen Norrington I thought The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a pretty decent big budget special effects fest that is worth watching if you want some mindless action. The script by James Robinson is based on the Alan Moore & Kevin O'Neill comic books & takes several well known character's from various literature sources & sticks them all together to create The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, even though the script itself has no regard for the character's original origins & does little to try & keep them as they were in their original outings. The basic idea of bringing together some of these character's & teaming them up to fight evil sounds like a decent idea but the story is far from extraordinary & to be honest I'd even struggle to call it anything better than just plain ordinary. The twists & turns are pretty obvious, have no impact & fall very flat, the story is really basic & extremely thin, I mean the average James Bond film was doing these ludicrous bad guy wants to control the world type stories virtually half a century ago & The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen offers little else other than a lot of flashy CGI effects. Having said that it's still good entertainment, it's fun, it moves along at a fair pace & never really bores plus there are some impressive individual scenes in it although by the middle of next week I'll probably have forgotten all about it.Director Norrington does a fine job, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen has wonderful production design, fabulous costumes, sets, top-notch special effects & I love that over-the-top Rolls Royce type car Capatin Nemo has. I'm positive there are loads of references to the character's original literature source's if you look & listen carefully enough. The filmmakers were obviously aiming for a teen audience & as a result the violence is tame & the fights lacklustre, they just don't have any edge & lack a bit of excitement.With a supposed budget of about $78,000,000 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen looks fabulous with fantastic CGI effects but for that money what else would you expect? Apparently shot all over the place including California, Canada, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, Austria & Prague in the Czech Republic. The acting was alright considering the material was somewhat thin & silly, Connery is still class & could act in his sleep.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is, frankly, ordinary. It's a big budget mindless way to pass just under a couple of hours but the story is weak & the character's aren't really used to their full potential while the film has little regard for their origins. Worth a watch for sure but, special effects apart, don't expect anything amazing.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
20,dbborroughs,"No, its not the Comic",10,17 February 2004,"Most people were upset that this film did not live up to the reputation for Moore and O'Neill's very over rated first comic book series, which is sad since taken on its own its a good little action film.The story in which a bunch of great literary characters are brought together to defeat a literary bad guy is excitingly told. Granted the visual effects are at times lacking but its the adventure that drives the beast and here its top notch even if its predictable (How could it NOT be?) The cast is fantastic with not a bad one in the bunch, its impossible to tell the set was filled with strife since they appear to be having such a wonderful time.Turn your mind off and drop any expectations and simply see this film.

21,zardoz-13,"Sean Connery's best action movie since ""The Rock""",10,18 February 2008,"The improbable logistics of the exciting new Sean Connery science fiction adventure saga ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" won't stand up to scrutiny. Meaning, moviegoers who nit-pick at flicks probably won't appreciate this special effects laden extravaganza. For example, when our intrepid heroes cruise into Venice, Italy, circa 1899, aboard the fabulous submarine 'the Nautilus' of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" fame, they should have run aground. Under actual circumstances, those scenic Venetian canals don't draw enough water to accommodate a sub. Later, Tom Sawyer of Mark Twain's ""Tom Sawyer"" performs the impossible as he races along straight stretches of street in Venice. You can wheel around in circles without accident, but those claustrophobic Venetian roads aren't straight enough for him to pull off those ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" stunts. Indeed, virtually everything in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" qualifies as wholly unbelievable, so hard-core realists won't buy a bit of this outlandish, over-the-top, 19th century nonsense. Nevertheless, part of the charm of this imaginative Victorian-era ""X-Men"" is its name-dropping line-up of literary characters, its hopelessly preposterous heroics, and its futuristic gadgets far ahead of their time.""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" opens ominously in the year 1899 as weapons technology has made great strides forward in firepower and mobility. London City police run amok when an armor-plated vehicle resembling a pre-World War I tank batters its way into the Bank of England and blows the vault. Out pour villainous Germans sporting Nazi-style helmets and primitive but nonetheless lethal machine guns. A montage of newspaper headlines splash across the widescreen forecasting war in the offing. At the head of these sinister looking brigands is the Phantom, a tall, intimidating figure that conceals burned face under an operatic mask and brandishes a cane with an evil-looking skull. The Phantom dreams of dominating the world by starting a war and then wiping out the survivors. Meanwhile, the Head of British Intelligence M (Richard Rexburg of ""Moulin Rouge"") dispatches Sanderson Reed of Her Majesty's Government (Tom Goodman-Hill of ""Charlotte Gray"") to find someone to lead a special ""A-Team"" of sorts to stop the Phantom.Looking fitter than ever, 73-year old Sean Connery of James Bond fame plays one of the 19th century's more colorful heroes Allan Quatermain, a white South African adventurer prominently featured in H. Rider Haggard's classic novel ""King Solomon's Mines."" Reed approaches Quatermain in Kenya to persuade him to head up the League of Gentlemen. No sooner has Reed made his offer than a gang of armed assailants enter the club and shoot the place up, killing Quatermain's best friend Nigel (David Hemmings of ""Blow-Up"") who often impersonates Quatermain to shield him from tourists. Quatermain accepts Reed's offer as the gun smoke clears. In London, Quatermain assembles a literary who's who of Victorian-era characters. Captain Nemo (veteran Indian actor Nasseeruddin Shad of ""Monsoon Wedding) of Jules Verne fame provides 'the Nautilus' as transportation, so our heroes can set sail to Venice where the abominable Phantom plans to demolish the city with underwater bombs. Other team members include Mina Harker (Peta Wilson of TV's ""Nikita"") who appeared in Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula""; Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran of ""Blade 2"") who stole the Invisible Man's formula but accidentally doused himself; the immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend of ""Queen of the Damned"") of the novel ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""; U.S. Government Special Agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West of ""Get Over It); and Dr. Henry Jekyll (Jason Fleming of ""Snatch"") of Robert Lewis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" By far the most inventive character in ""League"" is Dr. Jekyll. When he drinks his mysterious potion, he turns into a gigantic ""Hulk-esque"" Mr. Hyde. No matter where kindly Dr. Jekyll goes, his alter ego peers back at him from mirrors and windows nagging him incessantly to let him out.Director Stephen Norrington, best known for the original ""Blade"" with Wesley Snipes, rarely lets the momentum lag in this marvelously lensed melodrama. The ingenious James Dale Robinson screenplay, based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, finds enough time during its efficient 110 minutes to elaborate about character when our heroes aren't plunging recklessly through one metaphorical flaming hoop after another. Sure, the ""League"" is formulaic and predictable despite its somber ending, but Norrington delivers exactly what you'd expect from such a movie. The fights are as fast as they are furious with an agile Sean Connery pummeling his opponents with his white-knuckled fists. ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is Sean Connery's best action movie since ""The Rock"" and the most creative superhero movie of the summer.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
22,Boba_Fett1138,Why isn't this movie any better?,5,11 January 2007,"With all these great classic characters, how come this movie isn't that much good? Yeah, well sure the movie offers decent enough entertainment but really, in its core this movie had far more potential. It features many classic characters everyone all over the world has heard of. Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde, all put together in one movie. It sounds like enough material to make an entertaining adventurous movie with. The movie is however seriously flawed with its story and character treatment and though its entertaining, it at the same time is a rather disappointing movie.The story is very messy. The reason for this is probably the fact that the movie is filled with so many characters (yes, yes, I know that the movie is based on a comic book and therefor they couldn't do much about it.). Halve of them really don't serve a significant enough part in the movie. Seriously, what are Mina Harker and Tom Sawyer doing in this? Especially the villainous plot of the movie is very shaky and far from interesting or completely understandable, though it really should be, since it's what the movie is all about. The movie tries to put in some clever 'twists' and 'turns' that just don't work out due to the fact that the story is a far from likable or interesting one. It's one of those movies you just couldn't care less about the story.I can't say I was happy about the casting either. Naseeruddin Shah plays Captain Nemo about as boring as possible. Somehow I have the feeling that the writers didn't intended the character to be that way. And who's bright idea was it to cast Peta Wilson as Mina Harker? And really, Sean Connery is really too old by now to still play a heroic main character convincingly. Richard Roxburgh is still somewhat good in his role, too bad that his character isn't that very interesting.The action in this movie is pretty big and good looking but it all feels very random. This is due to the poor storytelling, that never ever really gets to flow well enough to consider the movie to be greatly compelling- or even entertaining. Guess that the movie is sort of like ""Van Helsing"". It also puts many different well known characters in the movie, with as a result that the movie feels too crowded and messy. The movie tries to achieve way too much but doesn't succeed in halve of it.The movie has a good visual style and some impressive looking sets and costumes. At times the special effects are also impressive but at other moments they're very poorly done.In essence the movie had far more potential really. Will I give a sequel a chance? It probably will never get made but I'm willing to give at a chance at success, as long as they've learned from the mistakes they made with this movie. In its core the stories and characters show some really good potential to make some good looking and entertaining movies with.Maybe just good- and entertaining enough to watch it just once.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Entertaining, but not for purists or those looking for more than just that... entertainment",5,21 February 2004,"An action film set in Victorian England. A movie based on a masterful graphic novel by a man of undeniable talent in the art of writing them. Sounds interesting, and as if it has quite a bit of potential. The movie *could* have been worse... and it's definitely entertaining. Directed by the man behind the first Blade picture, this is as flashy and stylized as they come. At times, this takes away from the enjoyment, but mostly, it's just cool to look at, and the film does feature some rather nice visuals, and only once or twice does the much-used animation only look cartoon-y. The script changes around quite a bit of source material, and fans of the original work by Alan Moore(yours truly included) will, by no means, find this to live up to the quality of that. There are various references to famous literature, though nowhere near as well-implemented as they were in the novels, and, whilst probably conceived as cute and clever, they more often than not come off as embarrassing. For all the teenage boys out there, in spite of the low-cut piece that Wilson wears in the poster and on the cover, she dresses far more conservatively than that for most of this. Hyde's transformation is somewhat interesting. Characters are changed around, mainly for sheer cool-ness effect. Some of the camera-work and editing is quite nice. Much of the dialog is atrocious, and some of the lines are even poorly *delivered*, due to how awful the writing is(some things, you just *can't* get to sound good or real). The action is mostly exciting and well-done, and I'd say it's the best thing about the film. The pacing is slightly off. Characterization is limited, but reasonable. Acting varies. The villain is somewhat ruined(early on, at that) by too much exposition(in that he works solely as a mysterious, unseen character... beyond that, he starts to seem silly), and he's not the only one... and on the subject of exposition, some of it is really obvious. The film has events that require *serious* suspension of disbelief. The characters all seemed interesting. The humor is good. The special effects are also very good, much better than several other new movies(read: Pirates of the Caribbean, Terminator 3). The film isn't bad, it just isn't terribly memorable, either, but it does provide reasonable entertainment for the duration, if you can stand the stuff that doesn't work well, and, well, for fans of the novel... personally, I just view this as a separate entity altogether, inspired by, but not based on, Moore's work. It helps. I recommend this to any fan of action and adventure... as long as you aren't too upset by inaccuracies, that you have a high threshold for bad dialog, and you don't have to pay much money, if any at all(catch it on TV, instead) to watch it. Attention and time could also be better spent. 5/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
24,neil-476,High concept romp,8,24 June 2010,"I always read other comments with interest, but I make my own mind up. This means that I sometimes have no time for films which others rate highly. And it sometimes means that I like films which others agree aren't very good. Taste is intensely personal, as evidenced by the fact that nearly every movie which has more than a handful of opinions can boast at least one review which trumpets it as the best movie ever, and at least one which derides it as the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Alan Moore came up with a brilliant idea - a secret organisation peopled by out-of-copyright characters from Victorian fiction - and this film takes that idea and more or less does its own thing with it. It is inspired by the comic rather than based on it and, therefore, requires to be judged on its own merits.It is daft. But it is big daft fun, with an arch sense of its own ridiculousness. It has a visual sense of its own, some fun design, and some fruity performances, plus a plot which is sufficiently effective to keep you guessing.If you've ever read any of the great popular fiction from around the turn of the 19th/20th century, you are likely to get some moderate enjoyment from this engagingly potty movie.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
25,ferguson-6,"Extraordinary premise, less than ordinary execution",6,13 July 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Wonderful premise of a mastermind evildoer attempting to steal the powers of many literary legends.  Execution of the film by director Norrington is inexcusable.  Action scenes were filmed close-up and in such hyper speed that ones eyes cannot make sense of the scene.  Stuart Townsend (as Dorian Gray) shows some intrigue as an actor and Sean Connery can still dominate the screen.  The rest of the supporting cast were passable at best and the Mr. Hyde effects were failed.  Again, the premise is wonderful and in better hands might have proven to be a very interesting and entertaining film.  Although the end leaves itself open for a sequel, my guess is word of mouth will kill this one.

He is accompanied by Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Rodney Skinner, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Henry Jekyll (also Mr. Edward Hyde).Soon into their adventure they discover that the Fantom is behind these attacks, but there is more to this war than battle and cunning.....The problem with he film is that it gets too confusing too quickly, and Red Herrings are thrown at us more times than decent set pieces. In the end the film is just trying to be too clever for its own good.This of course was the time of the Matrix sequels and harry Potter beginnings, so fair dues to the makers for trying something with too much flamboyance.Obviously they were going for a franchise here, and after nine years, it's still a fun movie to watch, just too messy for it's own good.The cast seem to be having fun (apart from Connery) and Townsend almost steals tho whole film from everybody.Good for a campy night of movies, nothing else.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The other members include The Invisible man, Mina Harker, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekell/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and even Tom Sawyer.  This one has some good action as I have said, though I didn't care much for Hyde's appearance and it makes me glad they went with a totally cgi Hulk.

30,JamesHitchcock,Steampunk Bond,7,7 January 2008,"Let us imagine that the late Ian Fleming had invented a time machine and travelled back to the late nineteenth century, where he got together with Rider Haggard, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells and Conan Doyle to write a ""Boys' Own"" adventure story. The result might just have been something like the plot of this film.The film is set in 1899 and the League of the title is a sort of alliance of all the fictional superheroes of the period- Haggard's Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Dorian Grey, Wilhelmina Harker (from ""Dracula"") and the Invisible Man. They are joined by Tom Sawyer, who does not really count as a superhero, but apparently the producers needed at least one American character. (This Sawyer, moreover, is considerably younger than Twain's hero would have been in 1899- Twain's novel, in which Tom is a boy, is set in the 1840s). They have got together in order to frustrate a plan by a criminal mastermind named ""The Fantom"" (sic) who is trying to provoke a European war in order to boost his weapons-manufacturing business. There are to be startling revelations about the Fantom's true identity and about his true motives (it turns out he has in mind a scheme even more nefarious than starting World War I fifteen years early). There are suggestions that one of the League might be a traitor. This sounds like the plot of a James Bond movie with a period setting, so it is perhaps appropriate that Quatermain, the leading light in the League, is played by Sean Connery, the original 007 himself.""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" belongs to the genre known as ""steampunk"", that is to say the literary/cinematic genre which delights in the technology, mostly steam-driven, of the Victorian era. There were, for example, steampunk elements in the recent film ""The Golden Compass"", with its steam-powered airships. The genre often incorporates alternate-history elements; a classic steampunk novel, although it was written before the term was coined, is Keith Roberts' ""Pavane"", a vision of an alternative England in which early nineteenth-century technology, such as traction engines and semaphore towers, persists throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. This film falls within this tradition; it is set in an alternative 1899, so the Fantom has managed to invent the tank nearly two decades before that weapon first saw active service. This is, in fact, an alternative universe where technical change (although not changes in fashion or aesthetics) seems to take place at a rather faster rate than it does in the real universe. We see, for example, a luxury saloon car of a type which, in our universe, did not appear until at least the 1930s; similarly Nemo's submarine could not, in our world, have been built using 1890s technology. Both these items, however, are decorated in a Gothic or Art Nouveau style- a vision of what a Victorian saloon car or ocean-going submarine might have looked like had the Victorians been able to build such things.(I did in fact wonder whether setting the film in an alternative universe was in fact a useful way of explaining away goofs and plot-holes- it is, apparently, not a goof to show a Venetian carnival taking place in 1899, even though in reality there was no carnival in that year. I presume, therefore, that this is an alternative universe where carnival takes place in July rather than February, where the Grand Canal is deep enough to accommodate an ocean-going submarine, where Mark Twain set ""Tom Sawyer"" in the 1880s rather than the 1840s, where the East End of London is not a working-class area but the sort of place where one might find an elegant gentleman's townhouse like Dorian Grey's and where German and British soldiers were already wearing First World War-style military uniforms in 1899).The plot is all fairly standard adventure stuff, and there are no really outstanding acting performances, although Connery is very watchable, as he normally is, and Peta Wilson makes Wilhelmina a splendidly seductive vampire. (Female vampires, for some reason, are generally portrayed as sexy in the cinema- think of Ingrid Pitt and the Collinson twins in those old Hammer films). Even the special effects are less spectacular than those in many recent blockbusters. I did, however, find it very watchable. Like a number of films based upon graphic novels, it has its own very distinctive visual style, especially in the scenes set in that mysterious, Gothic, fog-shrouded alternative London. It may to some extent represent a triumph of style over substance, but at least that puts ahead of many recent films which are not only insubstantial but also totally lacking in style. 7/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Even executive producer Sean Connery seemed to distance himself from his own movie by openly trashing its director.Anyway, `League' is a mess. Its redeeming factor for me is that Mr. Hyde is a better Hulk than this summer's Hulk and the graphic-novel roots seem more attractive by contrast. 19th century heroes gathered together to fight new menaces of a new century is an idea worthy of a comic book, but just plain superficial in a movie.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

36,Buddy-51,a bit better than expected,6,6 August 2005,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" got such punishing reviews when it was released in the summer of 2003 that it took me two years to finally get around to watching it. And I must say that, now, having seen it, I can't understand what all the fuss was about. This is a perfectly serviceable big budget action movie as such things go - not much better, but certainly no worse, than half a dozen similar movies released that summer (it's actually less bloated than the far more popular ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which inexplicably garnered rave reviews and sailed off with boatloads of money).It's 1899, the dawn of a new century, one in which all the old weapons of war are fast becoming obsolete and are giving way to far more lethal implements of mass destruction - machine guns, armored tanks, submarines and mega-explosives - all capable of killing far greater numbers of people than was ever thought possible before. Enter the Fantom (sic), a mysterious villain bent on using all this quickly developing technology to wage a global war with himself as commanding general. To counter this, a man named ""M"" gathers together a group of characters culled from 19th Century literary sources - among them Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, even Tom Sawyer! - to do battle against the menace.Although the script could have done a better job fleshing out the characters and making them more intriguing and distinct as individuals, the film has a couple of interesting plot twists and enough high-tech hardware to keep us entertained, if not exactly enthralled, through most of its running time. The movie is breezily paced and the screenplay has a fun time tossing around a lot of ""in"" jokes for those in the audience familiar with the literary backgrounds of these various characters.Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quartermain, an aging adventurer contentedly wiling away his golden years in Africa, until he is called back into the queen's service at this critical juncture in the empire's - and the world's - history. Naseeruddin Shah, Peta Wilson, Tony Curran, Stuart Townsend, Shane West, Jason Flemyng and Richard Roxburgh round out the rest of the cast.There really isn't anything that ""extraordinary"" about this ""League,"" but if you happen to run across this film on cable some long, lonely night, you may find it passable for an evening's entertainment.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
37,cherold,Not as fun as it should have been,6,18 August 2004,"This isn't a bad movie, it's more of a just miss.  It was just never as exciting or involving as it should be.  And while it had some impressive special effects, visually that gun-metal gray look wears out its welcome fast; if you're going for a monochromatic look you have to really make the visuals pop to even it out, and this movie instead has a drab, rather depressing look to it.I like the basic premise of a group of literary heroes and villains teaming up, and the movie does have its notable moments.  But the story isn't especially gripping and or original and there is something lazy about the way it's put together.  While I wouldn't fault an otherwise enjoyable movie for changing Mr. Hyde into The Incredible Hulk (in movies Hyde rarely has much to do with Stevenson's psychologically fascinating original) and would only be mildly perturbed by Mina doing something near the end of the movie that would be impossible for someone with her condition, but in terms of this movie these mistakes seem to typify a mental sloppiness in the whole enterprise (which is why Kane Thompson's nit-picking of the movie seems less silly after seeing it than before).I was hoping for an old-fashioned, rollicking adventure like The Mummy, but I got a little less, leaving me just a bit dissatisfied.  Not a terrible movie, but not what it should have been.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Participants include: Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, and Dr. Henry Jekyll (with Mr. Hyde tagging along).I have friends who love The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but I don't get it. I've seen this film twice now and on each occasion, I was bored out of my mind. To me, the movie is a dull mess of ideas that never really work. There's too much bad CGI, too many poorly lit action sequences, and a monotonous color palette that doesn't extend beyond gray. The gathering of characters seems to be more important than the mission. It takes about half the film to get them all together. And it's all done in a smug, condescending sort of way that gets annoying real fast. I know who these characters are - I don't need an extended exposition on each one. It's insulting. And speaking of insulting, I can't believe what the writers forced Sean Connery to say and do. He has some really embarrassing moments. None more so than when he's forced to pantomime throwing the invisible man out of his room. As I said, it's embarrassing for a man of his stature. Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a waste of time with few redeeming qualities. I'm not surprised that Connery decided to hang it up after starring in this disaster.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
39,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Bearly passable fantasy/adventure romp that I don't regret missing when it first came out,4,15 March 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A masked villain known as The Phantom is hellbent on creating international havoc and the world's leaders seem powerless to stop him. The British Embassy send a man to Africa to enlist the help of legendary hero Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery) who's living in exile after suffering a tragedy. He reluctantly ends up agreeing and with the help of six other heroes, each with extraordinary special powers (hence the title), sets out to track down his nemesis and bring him down. But as their mission wears on, everything emerges as not as straight-forward as it seems.There have been many big budget Hollywood flops over the years, big event pictures that failed to deliver as expected at the box office and left the big studios behind them ashen-faced at all the money they ended up throwing down the drain. But TLOEG went far beyond being a simple huge flop in the shape of, say, Hudson Hawk or The Avengers. It drove an admittently ageing but still strong presenced Hollywood mega star into retirement after reportedly having some seriously unpleasant creative disagreements with director Stephen Norrington, leaving this instantly forgettable little film as his legacy. While it's not as unbearable as some flops have turned out to be, it's still a bland and tepid affair that fails to work as a whole.All the hallmarks of a troubled production are sadly clear to see, with a clear lack of chemistry between the stars and a weak, thread-bare plot that's poor even by the standards of a comic book movie. With chemistry this weak, it's not surprisingly the result of actors with characters so droll you're not surprised. While there's some fairly spectacular effects and action on display, none of it really makes enough of an impression to sit through the duration of a film that thankfully doesn't run over the two hour mark, but still feels quite a slog to sit through all the same.This is one failure that it's not hard to see why a sequel was never made. Personally, Norrington's never been a director I've warmed to (even with his acclaimed Blade films) and if he was as big an arsehole to Connery as was reported during the shoot, hopefully this was enough to give his ego a much needed kick up the poop shute. **",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

If you do not like comics, there are good chances you will hate it - or maybe you are just a film critic :-)Comics is part of popular culture nowadays. The fact needs to be accepted, and the film industry already used comics inspiration for many of the greater and stronger than reality film heroes, from Superman to Hulk. 'League' is better than many of these similar works, as it approaches the action with some humor, and it creates a world which is just imagination, without pretending to be something else. The story is completely un-believable, but what can you expect from an imaginary gathering of imaginary characters from the 19th century popular literature? The characters are one-dimensional, and we care too little about them - with the exception of Connery's hero - Connery cannot do wrong, can he? There is some style in the effects, never letting us forget that we are in a comics story.
The film is not a masterpiece, but is decent family entertainment, better than the similar stuff coming from Disney studios and alike. You can ever teach the kids about some of the 19th century literary hits, as their generation has little chances to read the books today anyway. 6/10 on my personal scale.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
42,Cineanalyst,Victorian Literature Squandered in CGI-Bloated Nonsense,3,10 July 2018,"It's somewhat interesting to review this film fifteen years after its release, now that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is leading the way in franchises full of superhero characters and when even a TV series, ""Penny Dreadful,"" figured out how to better combine a bunch of Victorian-era literary characters together. Part of the reason ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" didn't work is that the script is terrible, especially after the initial recruitment of characters is done. Another is that most of the characters get short changed by the focus being on, besides the CGI, star Sean Connery, who, reportedly, argued with the director throughout the production.The bigger problem, however, is the disregard for those characters' literary traditions. Why even use them, then? I've never read the comics that the movie is based on, although I've heard plenty of grumbling about how it diverges from the series, but I have read most of the original novels, or at least seen other, better film adaptations of those works. Doyle, Haggard, Stevenson, Stoker, Twain, Verne, Wells, Wilde--so much to work with, so little used. I specifically came to this movie in my quest to see a bunch of movies at least partially based on Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula,"" and the mishandling of his Mina is arguably the most egregious here. Not only is she significantly marginalized from her role in Stoker's story, but also, I hear, from her leadership role in the comic. In the novel, she became the real leader of the gang trying to kill Dracula, while Van Helsing, akin to Sean Connery's role in the movie, did a lot of the loud talking many might mistake as leadership. She largely did this by becoming Stoker's surrogate storyteller within the book, sorting together the various diary entries, letters, records and other accounts that formed the book's epistolary structure. It would've been interesting if the movie had tried to do something similar given the characters and literary traditions involved.Instead, they turn Mina into a heroic vampire, and she fights another immortal, Wilde's Dorian Gray. It's awful. ""Penny Dreadful"" handled its immortals better, in that case Gray and the Frankenstein creatures, which I think was the best part of the otherwise lackluster series, as the immortals struggled with and divorced themselves from the lives of mortals. Oh, and apparently this movie's Mina is a chemist, too, for some reason, even though they have Dr. Jekyll and an Invisible Man aboard. (To be fair, I guess, it should be noted that almost every Dracula-related movie has diminished Mina's role and many of them are quite sexist about it.) Jekyll, when Hyde, is basically Marvel's the Hulk. Meanwhile, Nemo is merely a source of transportation, Tom Sawyer is there for supposed youth and American appeal and, as for ""M,"" see another recent TV series, instead, ""Sherlock.""(Mirror Note: I've been noting the use of mirrors in Dracula movies, as they're often a prominent feature, but here mirrors are, instead, employed for Jekyll/Hyde, so the two can talk to each other.)",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

45,CuriosityKilledShawn,A mess!,1,7 May 2004,"What could have been intriguing and exciting alternate universe adventure movie ends up being a calamitous mess that's the result of far, far too many ideas being thrown at the audience at once. LXG caves in on itself leaving only a shell of a movie behind.It's cool to see that Sean Connery is still up for physical action but the rest of the cast is more than absolutely wasted. Most of the characters hint at some form of motivation but never seem do anything in particular. The director seems to give each one of them their own 'bit' in which they fight a bad guy or something but there is no real reason for all of them to be there. Except for some barmy 'plot' about a bad guy called 'The Phantom' (no, not Billy Zane in a purple catsuit) who wants to take over the world.Stephen Norrington (who was once set to direct Freddy vs Jason a long time ago) seems obsessed with turning every part of the movie into a 'crumbling masonry set piece'. Trevor Jones' score in bizarrely unmagical, the effects are far too frequent and extravagant for such a flippant, unhesitant presentation and the ending is a total let-down. There are dozens of unexplained elements in this film. Like why does the Vampire woman's hair constantly change from red to black? How can she walk around in the sunlight? Why are Mongolian peasants played by white folks?

Maybe it wouldn't be known as the colossal failure that it was if this wasn't Connery's last movie before he retired. That being said, it was pretty awful. I can't recall one action scene that truly stood out! It looks great, but you would think a movie with these types of classic characters would be a lot better than it was. Sadly that was not the case what so ever. Sean Connery looks partly embarrassed to be in this film and I don't blame him. He was far from horrible, but he's been a lot better.

It's not that it's beyond unbelievable; although it is.I despise this type of film-making because it involves the theft of someone else's intellectual characters. The cartoon makers and the film makers lack the intellect to develop their own characters. So they steal the character of Allan Quatermain by British author H. Rider Haggard. They steal the character of Captain Nemo by French author Jules Verne. They steal the character of Dorian Gray by Irish author Oscar Wilde. They steal the Invisible Man character by H.G. Wells. They steal the Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde character from Robert Louis Stevenson. They even steal the Tom Sawyer character by Mark Twain (although here he is an adult). Admittedly, they are probably on firm legal ground, but nevertheless they intellectually stole the characters of other authors. Well, in reality, not ""other"" authors, because they couldn't write their own characters.I also dislike this film because it requires a TOTAL suspension of belief and logic. There is such a thing as being too fantastic.Does this mean that the film has no redeeming qualities? No. In my view, it has three. First, and paramount, it has Sean Connery in his last film role. And in almost any film, Connery is a wonder to behold, and no less so here. Second, here and there there are some fine (though brief) dramatic moments.

While the special effects lag behind the rest of the crop of new movies, the characters and the fighting scenes are remarkable. The fighting scenes are probably some of the most dramatic in that the rapid fire, whizzing photography grabs the reality of real combat instead of the choreographed oddity of most adventure, action movies.

49,The-Sarkologist,How to butcher beloved characters from classic novels,4,16 November 2012,"I think the description of 'Justice League of Victorian England' basically describes the idea behind this movie which in turn was based on a graphic novel of the same name. The movie takes a number of characters from famous novels of the period and throws them against a famous villain from the novels of the era, and what it basically boils down to is another dull superhero movie set in Victorian England.I initially liked the idea of developing a steam-punk setting because there never actually seems to be all that many movies that explore this idea, and even when they do, they generally do not turn out that good (Wild, Wild, West for instance). Probably the best movie that has actually used this setting would have to be Guy Ritches' Sherlock Holmes movies, but even then these movies were designed more to bring out what Holmes really was like rather than the character that we generally identify with.Basically the plot of this movie and the plot of 'Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows' are identical, right down to the villain of the piece (yep, Professor Moriarty, without Sherlock Holmes, but that is because he is dead, even though he never actually died). Basically Moriarty has decided that he wants to make a lot of money off of selling weapons, and then only way to do that is to set the nations at war. The silly idea about this is that we don't actually need some crazy villain to set nations at war because they will do it anyway. Even though Britain had experience 100 years of peace at this time, that was not because they weren't at war, or there weren't any wars, it was simply because they were not at war with any European power.The things that got me about the movie was mainly Nemo's submarine. It was simply way too big to do what it was supposed to do, that is sail up rivers and enter the canal's of Venice. Okay, they sort of made things larger, but the reality is that they created this really big sub and them made it do things that was impossible to do, such as sail up the Siene to Paris. Then there is Mina Harken, the wife of Jonathon Harken. Why is she a vampire? From what I recall, she was never bitten by Dracula, and neither was Jonathon, so why did they make her a vampire? Okay, the reasoning behind this was not so much the movie but the graphic novel that it was based upon, but still, it sort of made the film feel somewhat ridiculous to me. Further, the introduction of Secret Agent Tom Sawyer is simply laughable. Okay, they wanted to bring a famous American character into the film that would appeal to people, but having just finished reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, having Tom Sawyer suddenly becoming a secret agent that shoots like an American (fire enough bullets and hope to hit something) simply did not fit with the original character. Oh, and one final thing, since Mina Harken is a vampire, should she like be avoiding the sun?",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

He was offered roles in The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but passed as he didn't understand the scripts. So when offered another screenplay he didn't quite get, he took it, hoping it would be a huge hit as the other two were. Connery and the director hated each other. In Empire Magazine, Jason Flemyng was asked if the bust-ups between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington were as bad as reported. He replied that they were much worse ""My favourite bust-up was in Venice. The League had to walk from Captain Nemo's boat down the street, Magnificent Seven-style. At the end of the take Norrington asked them to do it again, to which Sean shouted 'What? You want us to do that again?'

As the film assumes we're familiar with all the characters already, they really don't offer explanatory introductions.

Sure Sean Connery is in it and it has several other cast members but I saw some problems such as Stuart Townsend as the immortal Dorian Gray. Was it just Me or did he just not look like but also acted like Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl? Also another similarity I noticed was when Dr. Henry Jekyll turned into Mr. Hyde I noticed that the face of the CGI creation resembled Brian Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff in the alternate 1985 in Back to the Future part II! I was very disappointed that M was the Phantom and that the Phantom wasn't a legit character in the film I mean with that long hair, silver mask, and cane he had the potential to be one of the best villains ever in My opinion! The story is also a bit confusing. Most of the special effects were very good but I hate to say this but the super Hyde or whatever you want to call him near the end of the movie looked like a character or monster from some kind of video game! I mean in My opinion it was really bad.  The movie has a lot of action and has lots of potential itself but since it doesn't know if it wants to be a different kind of Universal Monsters film or a X-men film I can't say what I really think of it.

53,johnnyboyz,A mid-table finish for this league,6,22 September 2005,"Going into the film I was sure that I'd expect quite a bit of 'gung-ho' action and not a lot of dialogue or plot so I let my brain relax; this was, after all a film full of comic book characters and these days, MOST (not all) but MOST comic books are aimed at children. What stopped me from keeping away entirely was the fact that this film wasn't going to be built around your 'everyday' comic book characters, most of which have all had their own box office success in the past decade or so. No, it was time for the 'oldies' to emerge and even I struggled to recognise some of them but there are enough familiar names to help you by such as 'The Invisible Man' and 'Dr. Jekyll'. All right, this isn't exactly your rapid, free-for-all piece of 'Team A Vs. Team B' film such as 'Aliens Vs. Predator', in fact it doesn't even reach the dizzy, over fantasised heights of something ridiculous such as 'Superman Vs. the T-1000' or something like that. What it actually is, is a rather intriguing look into an alternate world set at the turn of the 19th-20th century in Europe. Rather premature plot making may greet us from the off in the form of 'England Vs. Germany on the brink of war' but this mearly creates an unrest and it gives us a pretty good introduction into the fact that 'yes, this film IS going to be inaccurate and yes, this film IS going to be as fantasised as possible.'The good news is that this film isn't drowned in a sea of too much fantasy. There are parts when you shake your head in disbelief and smirk at the fact a huge ship/submarine is gliding with ease through the narrow, delicate streets of Venice, hardly damaging other buildings and boats and that there are enough road systems in Venice (Road systems in Venice!?) to actually take a rather fast sports car the distance that it did. The other fact being that British police 'bobbies' do not just stand in front of a tank that is coming at them at full speed, hoping it will slow down, ordering 'in the name of the law'. Mearly the fact that they didn't know what the hell it was is enough for everyone to retreat. Apart from a couple of things like this it's fine and these certain events are rather scattered through out the film so there is a nice run to it. Although the film doesn't rely too much on the acting, it's still pretty good. Connery's performance is a nice balance between his Bond character and Indiana Jones' father which really suits the 'veteran' feel about him. The other's such as Jason Flemyng's character are also pulled off. He manages to play the brilliant but troubled scientist pretty well who has the infamous 'double identity' attribute of the man him self and the raging 'Mr. Hyde'. In fact, if there was any more of him, the film would have had to have been put down as a 'film-noir' in the sub-genre column. The effects are good, the fight scenes (when they come along) are impressive and if you're after one and a half hours of action, fantasy and and odd feeling of retro atmosphere in a film, I'd recommend this.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I used to replay the Venice bomb explosion chase scene constantly on a weekly basis. And, this film started my fascination with Dorian Gray (no idea why...). However, much like these creative literary individuals, time is an unusual construct that uncovers cracks in what was once viewed as a masterpiece (totally not exaggerating...). It's a shame that Moore's source material was not fully realised in this adaptation, delivering only half the thrills and character interactions. A league of highly powered individuals are assembled to take down a vigilante known as ""Phantom"", who wants to start a war. There are predictable twists and turns and various sub-plots, but for the most part this is a straightforward story that relishes in its cyberpunk environment. It's not often you find yourself watching a blockbuster with Alan Quartermain, Dorian Gray, Captain Nemo and Dr Jekyll, and yet feel underwhelmed by the whole ordeal. One simple description for this: missed opportunity. The film that was delivered is fine, it's neither good nor bad. Plenty of disposable action sequences and visual effects that produce a dark gothic tone which will appeal to many. The casting was decent, particularly Connery, and they all pull their weight and get involved. Unfortunately, these characters are fairly one dimensional and lack any sort of natural interactions with each other. Sure, there is banter and harmless mentoring that acts as foreshadowing, but they truly never felt like a league. The dialogue resorts to mass amounts of exposition (including an entire voice recording of explanations, thinking that viewers aren't intelligent enough to piece the details together), and clunky conversations that resemble two blocks of wood silently communicating. It's a shame, as there was so much potential to be had here! But the outdated cumbersome screenplay negates any potential of excellence.

The set design and costumes are very good. The action scenes are exciting. The characters and story are fun to watch. The cast is also very good.

57,damianphelps,A Bit Average,5,30 January 2021,"Cleary when this was made 90% of the casting money went to Connery and another 9% went to Jason Flemyng...after that its a fast ride downhill to meh!The first half of the story is far better than the second half as it seems to try and get sillier the longer it goes.Lots of stunt doubles to enjoy in this one, with Connery, fair enough but film makers need to make a better effort with doubles in my humble opinion. When stunt doubles are obvious 1 of 2 things is happening, the directors and co don't care enough to do it better OR, the movie hasn't distracted you enough with entertainment so you don't notice. In this movie is my be a little of both.A bit disappointing but harmless enough.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
58,BaronBl00d,Very Messy,2,29 December 2003,"Too many literary characters with little or no character exploration.  Too many car chases.  Too many gunshots.  Too many explosions.  Too many kick-boxer fights.  Too many cheaply outrageous CGI effects.  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had lots of creative possibilities but sqelched them mainly by taking its audience, maybe rightly so, as being too immature to understand what it was trying to do.  I must confess that I am intrigued with any film that has the likes of Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain, Mina Harker(and the possible promise of Dracula), Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, and Profesor Moriarity.  It's a who's who of great Victorian literature, and has endless future possibilities as it is indeed one of the richest literary periods ever.  But this film does so little with the chracters execpt make mangled stereotypes of what their names have become with the, how shall I say, less than literate, and exposes them as nothing more than cardboard characters.  Ask yourself why there are so many car chases, explosions, fights and the answer should come quickly.  With no character development and a plot that is utterly ridiculous(might not be if things had been explained like where did the car and tank come from?(one of many inexplicable things never explained)).  The acting is no less inspired with Sean Connery quipping one-liners like he is Wesley Snipes(yep, the guy that made this made Blade). The rest of the cast equally inane.  I found myself wanting to re-read many of the classic sources for this film, just to keep myself honset.  The unfortunate thing is that I doubt that idea will cross most of the viewers of this film, a sad commentary of our society and culture.  For in all those great novels, there is not one car chase!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
59,funkyfry,terrible disappointment,3,30 October 2007,"A disappointing film on many levels because there was so much promise here in the premise and the star, Connery, who's always fun. Unfortunately this is just another example of Connery using his star power on the wrong projects, and in this case since he's also a producer he should share some of the general blame for the mediocre quality of the film itself.The premise is an exciting one for fans of early science fiction or literature in general  with Europe faced by the threat of war, a team or ""league"" of turn-of-the-century hero types are gathered together to combat the menace. The heroes include Alan Quatermain (Connery), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), the invisible man (Tony Curran) and Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng), as well as (somewhat inexplicably) Tom Sawyer (Shane West). Their opponent is ""The Fantom"" (as in, presumably, the Opera, as a lame joke indicates), who is apparently doing things to start a war between Germany and England so that he can profit from arms sales.The beginning of the film is entertaining enough while these characters are being introduced but it never follows through on much of its promise. There's numerous problems which make the film less than it could have been. First and foremost, the direction is totally bland and lacks emphasis and focus. It's indistinguishable from a TV fantasy movie like ""The Librarian."" This director is so mundane that he makes Chris Columbus look like a fantasy auteur. The script isn't all that much either. ""Subtlety"" is a concept the film-makers might want to make themselves familiar with. I mean, I know we're living in a dumbed-down era and everything but nobody likes to feel like they can't figure anything whatsoever out for themselves or that they need to be led around on a leash. This film does not succeed as a fantasy/""pulp"" adventure film primarily because it does not give the audience any room to breathe or any space to feel wonder or just the joy of discovery and adventure. Instead everything is very straightforward, so that we can even see something like Nemo's Nautilus submarine cruising through the canals of Venice and feel inspired to do no more than yawn loudly.Connery is a fun star and it's unfortunate that this movie wasn't a worthy vehicle for his talent; in fact I haven't seen him in anything good in a decade. Here's hoping he gets back on track someday.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
60,Anonymous_Maxine,When did this movie take place again?,3,3 January 2004,"Okay, I'm not going to waste your time blabbering on and on about twelve-story ocean liners being made in the 19th Century, because I don't think it's something that needs to be pointed out. We all know that suggesting the existence of a cruise liner like that in 1899 is absolutely ridiculous, although it speaks volumes about the movie that such a massive break with reality needs not even be mentioned because it's already so obvious. The automatic suspension of disbelief can only be expected to go so far. On the other hand, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is not a movie that presents itself as intending to be taken all that seriously. It's clearly an adventure film made purely for entertainment purposes (and not in the slightest way meant for any kind of cognitive or logical appreciation), so there are some goofball things in it that are certainly expected to be taken in good fun. Like, for example, the fact that absolutely nothing in the film makes any sense. Let's assume that you can overlook the fact that not only does an ocean liner of that sheer magnitude exist in the late 1800s, but it is also able to cruise casually through those miniscule canals in downtown Venice. You know, the ones that are spider-webbed with tiny pedestrian bridges every block or so. I hate to say this, but I've never even been to Venice and I still knew enough to slap my forehead when I saw that. If you're able to swallow THAT, you're probably not going to be ready for many more breaches of reality, in which case you better stop watching the movie.So this ocean liner, hundreds of years ahead of its time (if it will ever have its time), zooms through the ocean `like a sword,' and we are later forced to watch as an escape pod, probably 75-100 feet across, pops out of the side of it and starts zooming away on its side, propelled by hundreds of huge blades that ring its circumference. Clearly, much of the technology in this film was produced by the same mysterious company (and with the same intentions of distracting your attention away from the astronomical liberties taken by the films) that must have been operating in the late 1800s and that made the 80 foot tarantula that we saw in Wild Wild West.
So if there's an ocean liner like this in the movie, obviously no one will complain that a futuristic car is able to zoom through the streets in Venice (note: there are no streets in Venice, as in many other major European cities which were also primarily built before cars existed). At least it's not amphibious like the ocean liner/submarine. Okay, sorry. I told you I wouldn't go on about the ship. I'll stop.The thing that really bothered me about this movie, besides the inability to apply even the slightest amount of logic to it, is that it is a Hollywood film that seems to deliver to the world the idea that the mainstream American audience would get a big kick out of watching the massive destruction of European cities that are many times older the nation of America itself. I liked that some band of villains start off by inflicting massive damage with this gigantic tank and robbing banks with it and whatnot in order to turn countries in Europe against each other (since they each think the other is responsible), eventually driving all of Europe to the brink of continent-wide war. A fantastic movie could have been made with this premise. But then you have the entry of all of these characters from old movies and, mostly, classic literature, such as the invisible man, a vampire, the man who can't be killed (not sure exactly where he comes from), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (the latter of which is magnified to almost the same cartoonish scale as the Hulk), etc. Sure, it was fun to see updated versions of these old characters. As Stephen King would say, people love to see characters from other stories return. It's almost like seeing family again. Sadly, computer generated special effects have made filmmaker's greedy, drunk on the theory that Mr. Hyde can simply be made into a gigantic monster to please the audience. No thought need be applied, just size. Oops.I would just like to say to those of you not in America that Americans do not think it's funny or entertaining to see the massive destruction of faraway cities. I know it's a movie, but the fact that major historical landmarks are defiled and destroyed, even only in computer generated images, speaks badly of our respect for the rest of the world.
Oh and can I just say one more thing? There's a scene near the beginning of the movie in which Sean Connery's character, Allan Quartermain, gets shot at by bad guys with machine guns. Still in 1899. So he responds by exclaiming, `Who in the world has automatic weapons?' I'd just like to point out that the idea of placing directly into the dialogue (and using modern terms) a line that points out a prop that has not yet been invented is just as bad as the scene in Jeepers Creepers where the idiot main character's sister is pointing out that what he's doing is the scene in scary movies where someone does something stupid and the whole audience hates them for it.

It isn't supposed to make sense,it's supposed to be entertaining - and it succeeds very well.

63,ackstasis,"""If you can't do it with one bullet, don't do it at all.""",5,27 December 2007,"Some movies, for some reason or another, simply acquire a bad reputation. When I first watched Stephen Norrington's 'The League of Extraordinary Gentleman (2003)' about two years ago, I couldn't work out why the film was held in such obscenely low regard. Of course, it is no masterpiece, but the concept behind the film is terrific, the characters are colourful and enjoyably portrayed, and there's a lot of action to keep one distracted from the monotony of real-life. Having watched the film again today, now older, and  so I'd like to think  a bit more intelligent, I still maintain that the filmmakers have crafted a worthy adventure, even though many cracks have begun to appear in what had previously seemed a fairly watertight movie. The story was loosely adapted from the graphic novel series, written Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, and published under the America's Best Comics imprint of DC Comics.In how many other films do you get to witness the greatest literary characters of the nineteenth century coming together to fight the greatest supervillain in history {I won't reveal who this villain actually is}? There's legendary hunter Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) of ""King Solomon's Mines (1885),"" alluring vampiress Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula (1897)"", Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng) from Robert Louis Stevenson's ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886)"", Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), the equivalent of H.G. Wells' ""The Invisible Man (1897)"", Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1870)"", Tom Sawyer (Shane West) of Mark Twain's ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876)"", and Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) from Oscar Wilde's ""The Portrait Of Dorian Gray"" (1891)."" Throw in a sailor who likes you to call him Ishmael, and you've got an ensemble cast of characters the likes of which you've never seen before!One could spend all day poking holes in James Robinson's big, dumb screenplay, but that would defeat the purpose of watching the film in the first place. 'The League of Extraordinary Gentleman' was designed purely for entertainment purposes, and it delivers enough thrills and extravagant visuals to keep its audience occupied, even if some sequences steep into sheer stupidity {for example, I hated the scene with the super-sized Mr. Hyde}. The computer-generated visual effects, though undoubtedly overused, are generally pretty good, and Dan Laustsen's cinematography makes the film, if nothing else, look rather pleasant. The actors' characterisations, coming from one who's only competently familiar with a few of the literary heroes, seem to be quite well done: Connery is his usual grizzled, heroic self; Stuart Townsend is cocky and refined; Australian Richard Roxburgh is always entertaining to watch. With this film, I recommend that you forget the poor word-of-mouth and give it a go; 'The League of Extraordinary Gentleman' is worth a watch.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
64,dee.reid,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" - 8/10",8,12 July 2003,"I give ""LXG"" five points alone on the basis that it's directed by gifted British filmaker Stephen Norrington, who as you should know, also directed Wesley Snipes in ""Blade"" (1998), another comic book adaptation.  ""LXG"" has the look and grace of a living comic book.  Norrington obviously learned a lot from working on the incredible living comic book that is Wesley Snipes' greatest movie to date and applies it here to ""LXG"".  The movie is actually pretty dark (which I didn't really expect).  That's another thing that struck me; the production and set designs all look marvelous, especially those shots of London, Berlin and Venice.  I'll say right now that I have never read the Alan Moore graphic novels that ""LXG"" is based on, since I've read that a number of changes were made to the movie.

65,CubsandCulture,A great concept greatly marred by execution,6,10 June 2019,"I ended up reading the Moore comic after seeing the film and the two are strikingly different. The film lifts only the general concept of combining a bunch of Victorian era characters into a superhero team and some extremely board plotting choices, i.e. who the villain is. The film's design aesthetic is also lifted from the comic somewhat. But that is largely it. The characterizations are all different-a few characters are even added to the film. The plotting is a lot less creative and a lot more action film based. With Connery in the lead it feels like a knockoff of a Bond film more than anything. Unfortunately, the resulting film is generally bad.The worst part is the script. It is hackneyed, lazy and highly predictable. I am really not sure why another pass wasn't made on it. A lot of the dialog is unintentionally funny. Worst pretty much every single homage (or reference) feels shoe horned in and forced. The central conceit-all Victorian literature is true and occurs in the same reality-is not deployed organically in the writing and it feels inauthentic. The script is just soo bad in this film.The action pieces, and the design are pretty good on their own. There are some choices which are ill advised. Why are there marble columns in the submarine? But yeah the old fashioned model work and the overall look of the film is quite engaging. It is a saving grace of the film that it really embraces the dark whimsy of the comic's design.This film should have been so much better.

The premise is not even that bad and I can imagine people liking the comic, unknown by me, very much.Basically we have a team of extraordinary gentlemen (and a woman) that exists out of famous people created by famous authors. The man putting the team together is M (Richard Roxburgh) and the leading character is Allan Quartermaine (Sean Connery). We also meet Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) and his Nautilus, Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) and her sharp teeth, Skinner (Tony Curran) who is The Invicible Man, Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) who of course is Mr. Hyde as well, Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) from the Oscar Wilde novel, and Tom Sawyer (Shane West) from the Mark Twain novel.After reading the above I can imagine you think the idea has some interesting elements and it has. But only the idea, the movie itself becomes such a mess after the introduction I could not have cared less what happened. The story is filled with clichés and mistakes so obvious it insulted the audience on numerous occasions. Especially the scenes set in Venice (I will not go into how they all end up there) are so ridiculous they could be in one of the 'Scary Movie'-films. I might have enjoyed that.

71,rosscinema,What? No Tarzan?,3,27 July 2003,"There are some films that you just have to sit back and enjoy and forget about logic, but where do you draw the line? This film was just to silly to enjoy. Story starts in about 1899 in an ""Alternative Universe"" and a man travels to Kenya to find the famed Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) and finds him in a lodge and tells him that his Queen and country need him because someone called The Phantom is about to start a world war. At first Quatermain says no, but after an attack by the Phantoms men that leave one of his friends dead he agrees. He travels back to England and meets ""M"" (Richard Roxburgh) who informs him that he has been recruited along with Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) who is a vampire, Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran) who is the Invisible Man, Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) who is immortal, Tom Sawyer (Shane West) and Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) who is trying to control his alter ego Mr. Hyde. They all have to get to Venice in three days because The Phantom plans on blowing up the whole city! They travel in Nemo's ship The Nautilous and they have an automobile that Nemo has built also. After Venice is half destroyed they have to go to the mountains in Mongolia and there they find a giant factory where armored vehicles are being built and The Phantom also has blood samples of each one of the main characters so he can create a superhuman soldier. Film is directed by Stephen Norrington who also directed the first ""Blade"" and he shows he can handle tough assignments but the implausible script sinks this film in my opinion. When they say this takes place in an ""Alternative Universe"" its just an excuse to ignore facts relating to places, events and characters. Tom Sawyer was put into the film for only one reason and thats to attract the American audience since most of the cast is European. The Nautilous is just way too big! Its the size of an air craft carrier and there is no way Nemo could have built it. Mr. Hyde is like The Hulk! He's not an alter ego, he's a monster! But if I do have anything good to say about this film its the special effects with Mr. Hyde. They look more impressive than Ang Lee's Hulk. Mina Harker is a vampire but in certain shots she's in the sunlight without being burned. And how deep could the canals in Venice be? Its impossible for Nemo's vessel to travel through it. Did Nemo make his own gasoline for that sports car he invented? And what was the purpose of ""M"" getting the characters together? That part of the story makes no sense. If The Phantom wanted blood samples why didn't he just get them one at a time instead of putting the characters together and have them try and thwart his plan? Somebody, please..Logic! The best thing that this film has to offer are some pretty good special effects and Sean Connery despite his age shows he can still handle himself in action films. He was a logical choice to play Quatermain. But the film drowns in silliness and implausible events. I think the reason that Tarzan wasn't used was because he's not considered a gentleman. Maybe Jane can teach him some table manners and he'll be ready if they decide to make a sequel!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
72,Kamurai25,The League of Extraordinary Characters,8,25 June 2020,"Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend, especially for fans of the (would be) Dark Cinematic Universe.There is some silly stuff in this movie, and it did not have a cg budget to include actual creatures, but there is plenty of classic stuff and even some fantastic preternatural / action stuff too.The production quality is decent, the writing is good (I believe it was taken from a comic), and the characters are all fascinating, most of the classic movie monster / characters and / or stories from old England, like Sherlock Holmes era.This is where we get into grey areas, if you're not accepting of the character presentation then you're going to fall off the wagon quick on this one.For those that don't know Allan Quatermain, its the concept Steven Spielberg stole for Indian Jones. An invisible man was a great inclusion (and a personal favorite of mine), Dorian Grey makes sense if you're familiar with the story.Revamping (!) Captain Nemo, Mr. Hyde, and Mina Harker felt good, but it might be controversial.

73,lemon_magic,Reasonably good adaptation of a eccentrically interesting story,7,20 November 2005,"LXG (as the logo on the promotional posters for this movie would have it) is a serious attempt at bringing an interesting and unusual concept from the comics to the silver screen. It ain't ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men"", nor does it try to be, because the attitude and atmosphere come from an entirely different sensibility. I think that's perhaps why the film met with such mixed reactions; the strength of your favorable reaction to LXG probably is in direct proportion to your enthusiasm for nostalgia-based entertainment and Victorian-era story telling conventions. And for the mindset of Alan Moore, one of today's most eccentric and unusual graphic story authors (only Neil Gaiman comes close). Screenwriter James Robinson originally gained a measure of fame and a fan following for his skillful revival of the obscure DC comics character ""Starman"". What distinguished ""Starman"" (besides wonderfully atmospheric pencils from Tony Harris) was that Robinson used the character (who was an antiques enthusiast and son of the original ""Starman"") as a way to make the entire series a tribute to how 'cool' and under-rated the original DC characters from the 40's and 50's really were, and could still be to modern readers if only they were given modern production values and a fresh viewing. It seems to me that Robinson was therefore a good choice to adapt Moore's 19th century heroic archetypes to the 21st century movie screen. The results? Well...they're mixed. But I am not sure an 'unmixed' adaptation would be possible, so I count my blessings. Purists will no doubt be irritated by the inclusion of Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray, and by the decision to turn Mina into an actual vampiress. But I didn't have a problem with it, since I realized that the producers wanted American audiences to have someone to identify with, as well as opportunities to punch up the visuals with CGI. And Sean Connery's version of Allan Q is far more vigorous and adventuresome than the frail, elderly, opium-addicted fellow of the comics, so I am all for that too. I've heard a lot of comments that the movie simply taxes the credulity of the audience, that there are too many plot holes, inconsistencies and ""oh sure"" moments. To which I reply: It's a movie about Victorian superheroes! It's set in an alternate FANTASY universe! What did you EXPECT??"" But the real problem is that there are simply too many characters doing too many things, and the viewer never really gets a chance to know or care about any of them...and the plot may test the patience of some people,even fans of ""Steampunk"" style fantasies. And let's face it, unlike ""Spider-Man"" and ""X-Men"" (and ""Fantastic Four"" later), the movie is pretty cold and emotionless. But I'm OK with that as well...these characters were straight out of the pulps and adventure magazines of the day, and ""warm and fuzzy"" was never their strong suit...or their appeal. The director and the actors give it a serious, professional try - the acting is what it needs to be to get the characters across as Moore - or even Robert Louis Stevenson - originally intended, and everyone gets some good lines in. (My favorite is Mina's snarky mockery of Allan Q's ""A Chase such as this is no place for a woman, even one such as yourself."") LXG is one of the movies I will pick up as a used DVD for $5-$6 and watch on occasion with a glass or two of Watney's Red Barrel firmly clenched in my hand. It isn't perfect, but it's fun to look at and it's fun to watch unfold.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
74,Rob_Taylor,"A valiant effort that, sadly, did not quite make it.",6,11 October 2003,"Yes, I actually quite liked this movie. I suppose I wanted to like it from the start. It's rare that Hollywood tries anything remotely different from it's tried and trusted no-brainer action movies involving cops etc. so I was predisposed to try and enjoy this flick. And I did, sort of.The concept is fantastic, albeit based on a graphic novel and not truly an original idea. But the delivery......well, it was a valiant effort to do something a little bit different from the norm. But it didn't quite do it.Most of the problem I think was due to three things. The casting, the plot and the effects.The cast simply weren't experienced enough (with the exception of Connery and Townsend). Mina Harker's actress in particular was poor. They simply didn't make the characters really come to life on the screen.The effects weren't awful, by any means, but they were VERY obviously what they were...CGI. The Nautilus in particular grated on my nerves....nice design, way too large and way too fake, though. The sight of it ""cruising"" up the obviously very deep canals of Venice was completely ludicrous to anyone who's ever been there.The story also suffered from shoddy thinking in more than one place. Driving a car through the ""streets"" of Venice was bad enough but, considering the place was collapsing, the fact that the said car never had to swerve to avoid a panicked local trying to get away was puzzling, to be sure. In fact, apart from in one place, Venice seemed deserted.And whilst I'm on the car......how on Earth did Sawyer know how to drive it?I can also point to the swarms of bats that Mina was able to summon. I can accept that in Venice - old city, probably lots of bats around, waiting for a vampire to summon them - it's reasonable. But I find it difficult to see where the bats came from in frozen Mongolia.And whilst were on frozen topics....just how did the Invisible Man survive his trek from the evil fortress to the good guys hideout. He was naked, for goodness sake! All we get is a glib one liner about not being able to feel his extremities, delivered in a steady, very obviously not-cold voice.It was the many scenes like this - just little annoyances, but one's that stand out instantly as ""not right"" when you watch them, that ultimately make this movie fail. It's not awful and it certainly isn't the monstrosity that ""Avengers"" was, but it just doesn't deliver the goods.Despite all these failings, it is still a reasonably entertaining movie. This just makes it more sad, however, because with better actors, better effects and a few plugs in the silly plot holes, it could have been a fantastic rollercoaster. As it is, though, a flawed work that will, no doubt, find a dedicated following, but likely won't spawn a sequel.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
75,philip_vanderveken,Nice if you like adventure movies who don't need to be realistic,6,7 March 2005,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" wasn't as bad as I feared it would be, thanks to the very nice visual effects, but in the end it still was far from a great movie. Especially in the beginning this movie felt very weird to me. I didn't exactly know what to expect yet and then I saw German soldiers driving a tank, shooting with hand-held machine guns and wearing a type of helmets they weren't yet supposed to have. Even though this story was set in 1899, they used these things that didn't even exist at that time. And to make things even more complicated, a whole bunch of characters like Captain Nemo, Dr. Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde, The Invisible Man,... were part of the team that was supposed to stop a world war from breaking out, caused by a man called The Fantom. I always thought they were characters from different books and comics, but than all a sudden they appeared together in this movie.Perhaps you have got to have a very open mind when watching this movie and if you want to see this movie as an adventure story, not based on any actual facts, than this may still be quite enjoyable. However, if you prefer movies to be realistic, than this is definitely not the movie for you. Personally I didn't like the story all that much, but I have to admit that the action shots and especially the visual effects were very nice to watch. For instance the submarine was cool and interesting. In the end this was movie wasn't as bad as I feared, but it wasn't all that good either. I give it a 6/10, only because of the special effects.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
76,brando647,"A Horrible, Wasted Opportunity",3,21 August 2012,"Recently, I was browsing my movie collection with a craving for a comic book movie, but I'd had my fill of Marvel and Batman for the time being. I came across THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, a movie I hadn't watched in years and figured it was due for another viewing. I mean, I vaguely remembered it sucking but I couldn't remember exactly why. It's based on an Alan Moore series. It stars the legendary Sean Connery. The premise combines a half dozen famous literary characters into an elite action team. How did it suck? Then I watched it again, and I remembered: because the movie is crap. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it does it's best to reach that level. LXG is a cookie-cutter piece of action garbage that takes what should have been an awesome concept and fills it with crappy dialogue and worse performances. Set in an alternate 1899, the world is dangerously close to a world war with a mysterious masked/disfigured terrorist known only as the Phantom inciting the countries against each other. A curious man, designated M, searches the globe in an effort to form a team with a chance of stopping the Phantom and saving the world from global war. The team will be led by Allan Quartermain and consists of Captain Nemo, the vampiress Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Henry Jekyll (and his alter ego Hyde), and the immortal Dorian Gray. With the assistance of American agent Tom Sawyer, things happen and explosions go off and the movie fails miserably. The end.Where did this movie go wrong? More than one could fit on a comment here, I suppose, but there are some glaring examples. Let's start with the worst offenders: the characters. I guess the majority of this blame falls on screenwriter James Robinson with a heavy dose of shame for the cast, because I know Alan Moore wouldn't have written anything this bad. Each and every character in this movie is a shallow caricature, spewing one-liners and ensuring they do everything in their power to be seen as living, breathing people. Every character in this movie is angry and cynical, cracking jokes and taking nothing seriously. Becausewhy? We expect all people in Victorian England to be uppity snobs? Between the seven main characters, there's barely an ounce of humanity. Now, I've only read two of the classic novels used as sources for these characters (""Dracula"" and ""Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"") but I feel comfortable in assuring viewers that these books and their characters didn't get to be as popular as they are for their shallow, emotionless characters. Again, some of the blame falls on the performances. Connery does the best he can, and I enjoyed Jason Flemyng as Jekyll/Hyde. Tony Curran has some good bits as the comic relief in the (non)form of the Invisible Man, but the rest of them should've been dropped. It wasn't until after the movie when I realized why I was so bother by the Phantom's ham-tastic performance; he was played by none other than Richard Roxburgh, the man whose Dracula helped destroy VAN HELSING a year later.Most of the problems lie in the characters/cast but a complaint could also be made against weak CGI. Admittedly, I was happy with the Mr. Hyde in this movie. The majority of effects were done practically and it looked a million times better than the one in the opening to VAN HELSING in 2004 (why do I keep referencing that movie?). But, there is a point in the final act where one of the Phantom's henchmen ingests an enormous amount of Jekyll's potion and, as a result, transforms into a giant, raging, CGI man-beast. And it looks absolutely horrible. And I mean freakin' horrible. If I had somehow been able to overlook every other flaw in this movie, this beast would've been a deal-breaker. On a more positive note, the production design in the movie is actually pretty good. I was happy with the design of Nemo's famed Nautilus and I was even able to accept his automobile. The look and feel of this alternate 1899 was about the only thing that worked for me in the entire movie. So I guess if this had been a silent movie, it might've been five times more enjoyable. It's no surprise this was the movie that finally pushed Sean Connery into retirement. When the movie was over, it terrified me with the hint of a possible sequel but, with Hollywood's current obsession with remakes, this movie needs it more than most. Let's do it again, and find someone to do it right.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
77,Gislef,"Good, but too fast",8,12 July 2003,"Generally enjoyable - Hyde, Nemo, Quartermain, etc., are well portrayed and there's plenty of subtle detail here. In fact the movie might be too subtle for many, who expect everything to be laid out for them. Whether that means Norrington and Robinson are just lazy, or figure that the audience should know who, say, Nemo is and don't want to talk down to them, I'm not sure.The only three gripes I had were that a) Did they ever mention that Tom Sawyer's first name was ""Tom""? If so, they must have jumped over it very very quickly. b) Wish they had mentioned Sherlock Holmes in conjunction with the revelation of Moriarty's identity. and c) Norrington's directoral style is all wrong for this - you can't bloody see what's going on? That works fine for, say, Blade, when they're fighting in a disco with strobe lights blaring. But that's what I felt I was watching here...and there's no disco, and no strobe lights (although he uses falling book pages to do the same thing). I should have said Nemo ""appears to be"" well portrayed - his fight scenes are so badly cut and quick-cut, who can tell for sure?",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Most people in the audience (2003) probably had no idea who Allan Quatermain (correct spelling) was, and I must have been asleep when they mentioned that ""Tom Sawyer"" was the blonde ""Indiana Jones""-type American Agent. Mina Harker is beautiful as a sexy vampire? I'll ""bite"" but not an enlarged hulk-sized Mr. Hyde and a bulletproof Dorian Gray. Pretty good for the first 90 minutes, and where they should have wrapped it up. We pretty much knew who the heroes and villains were by then. Then it goes on too long: Hyde-Hulk vs. Insanely-sized Hyde-Hulk. A second round of carnage, the castle explodes, and the prisoners are set free. (Too ""Lord of the Ringish"".) Also, The Nautilus is far too huge to negotiate the Venice Canals! Watchable Summer Nonsense. Only rated-up for good CGI effects. My verdict: 20 minutes too long!

79,Terryfan,Better then one is lead to believe,8,3 July 2015,"I know I said it before but there are movies that should be look past the junk and see the treasure. I remember watching this movie on HBO if I recall correctly one day mostly out of being curious.From what I saw it got my attention so I thought I would actually watch the movie is it a perfect movie? No Is it a masterpiece? No, Is it worthy of rewards? No but it is enjoyable and actually more fun then many give it credit for. Because The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen is not that bad of a movie at all it is pretty interesting, fun, clever entertainment. Isn't that a movie is suppose to do? I mean come on let's give this movie more credit.I really enjoy the plot of the film as it centers around a mystery man who calls himself M (Richard Roxburgh) as he hires Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) to lead a team against a ruthless madman. This team League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), and Dr.Henry Jekyll/Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng). What I like most about this movie is that the action scenes are really top notch, each fight scene is worth watching, they really take it up a notch and they all did a great job, it really gives that rush of action you want in a movie like this so they are enough to watch this movie. Also the movie features a good percent of plot twist that you won't see coming. The Writers did pretty well with playing the viewers they did a smart job with the plot twists that you have to watch to get otherwise it's no fun also the music in the film really matches the story and there is some good characters in this film along with a humor or two in the filmIt's not often we see characters from different series of books join forces so it made the movie interesting enough to me to watch it and I actually like it no it's not best movie in the world but it is not as bad as many say, once you just give it a chance you might be surprise that you did give it the chance because it is actuality an entertainment full, fun action and clever film it just needs a little appreciationI give The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen an 8 out of 10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

83,PatrynXX,Poorly paced.,5,20 January 2004,"(spoilers?)Well I think it's pretty obvious, the movie is utterly absurd.  But it didn't have to be a bad film , that it ended up being.  The movie is poorly paced.  Giving it a sense of being rushed.  I couldn't exactly put my finger on it, but it was like playing a record that has been scratched and suddenly skips forward.  Considering the Director did great with Blade, I'm not sure where he went wrong here.  And some of the producers came from the movie From Hell, and that certainly wasn't a bad film either. 
The CGI of the sub is half finished in one scene.  Never seen that before. Maybe they ran out of money?  Perhaps to pay Sean's salary?  I'm hearing in the dvd how he turned parts down from Matrix and LOTR.  Bloody hell why? Certainly better than LXG.  It's still better than The Avengers (hmmm another Connery movie)  At least LXG doesn't betray you by setting up a great movie, then hitting a brick wall of an ending.  (what ending)And what is Dorian Grey doing in this movie?  The Picture of Dorian Grey is just so horrific.  But this movie turns it into a joke.Then of course there's this silly ending of Alan being chanted on by a native who obviously can't figure out what a camera is.  ""Oh why am I acting like a nut.

85,mstomaso,Entertaining but Somewhat Lost in Translation,6,17 March 2008,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen originated in a comic book, and throughout the movie, its origins show. Unlike some of the excellent comic book films recently made, however, LEG does not compensate its audience for the missing hundreds of pages of character development and back-story by presenting a concentrated intro to Alan Quartermain (Sean Connery), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Jekyll and Hyde (Jason Flemyng), the Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townshend)and Tom Sawyer (Shane West). Instead, it is assumed that the audience is familiar enough with these legends of late 19th and early 20th century fiction to 'get it.' However, even familiarity with the stories these characters came from may not help you since the characters presented here bear very little resemblance to those of the books.In fact, this lack of characterization or consistence with the characters' literary origins is LEG's biggest problem. Despite the boldness and profound individuality of the original characters, none of them fully individuate in this film. Consequently, the audience's sympathies are not fully deployed, and LEG comes across as a fun but somewhat empty literary / special effects experiment.The mysterious M assembles a team full of extraordinary Europeans (see above) to combat an ensuing world war which appears to be driven by new military technology in the hands of a megalomaniac. If this sounds like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, be prepared because the similarities do not end here. All of this seems fairly straightforward until , of course, the massive plot twist creeps up on everybody.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is very plot heavy and action-oriented. The sets are lovely, the costumes are great, and the special effects are well done. What's missing are characters that you will want to care a great deal about. Interestingly, the seeds of sympathy are their - and I suspect this would be true even for people not familiar with the literary figures. But most of them pale in comparison with their literary version, and the very different personality of a few in LEG is never explained or elaborated. Quartermain , Harker and Gray bear little resemblance to their literary counterparts, though Sawyer, M, Nemo and Jekyll/Hyde are fairly consistent. Since The Invisible Man in LEG is not the same guy who died at the end of the novel, but rather a thief who stole the formula, we can cut him some necessary slack. I particularly enjoyed the depiction of Nemo's Nautilus and Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal of the ingenious scientist.If anything about LEG is extraordinary it is the cleverness of the plot. The twist, though its power is not fully exploited, is solid. And the characters of the villains are nicely used to develop subterfuge and misdirection. Unfortunately, even the impacts of these crucial plot points are somewhat muted by the matter-of-fact presentation of the story. The fight scenes are all excellent.Recommended for action and special effects fans. NOT recommended for fans of early 20th century/ late 19th century literature. Weakly recommended for Connery fans - a consummate professional, Connery does as well as he can in this film, but it is obvious that he was uncomfortable with his role from the beginning to the end.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be. Even the retro Victorian look seems uninspired. Overall, a huge disappointment.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
88,Beta_Gallinger,Sean Connery's last live action role was certainly not a highlight of his career,5,21 October 2010,"Around the time this was released in 2003, I saw a trailer for it on TV several times and saw that the starring role was played by Sean Connery. As clearly as I can remember that, it would be seven years before I would actually see the film. I am not at all familiar with the comic book series and graphic novel which this ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" movie is based on, but was reminded of this film due to Connery's starring role, now that I've seen more of his work in the past couple years. He's a talented actor, but by the time I watched ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", I had known for a while that it wasn't that popular. Because of that, I didn't have very high expectations, but still could have been more impressed than I was. In 1899, the Bank of England is attacked by men who appear to be German soldiers, but after this, it isn't long at all before a German zeppelin factory is attacked by the same men, this time dressed as British soldiers! After these two raids, the two countries are ready for war, a war which could spread all over! British emissary Sanderson Reed goes to Kenya to recruit Allan Quatermain to investigate. The two of them meet in a bar in this African country, but the hunter and adventurer refuses to have anything to do with this matter after what he's been through in his adventurous life. However, he changes his mind when Kenya is attacked! He then goes back to England with Reed. Here, Quatermain becomes a member of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a group which also includes Captain Nemo, an invisible man named Rodney Skinner, and Mina Harker, widow of Jonathan Harker! These characters from different stories must try and stop the Fantom, the main culprit behind these raids!Around the beginning of this movie, it already didn't really look that promising to me with the scenes showing the attacks in England and Germany. I'm not quite sure why, but these parts somehow failed to really grab me. I did find some excitement during the Kenyan bar raid scene, but there are plenty of other action scenes after this one, and I basically found them all boring, just like most of the non-action scenes. Sean Connery puts on a decent performance in the role of Allan Quatermain, but most of the cast performances really don't stand out. The weakest performance is probably from Shane West, who plays Tom Sawyer here, but another one I definitely didn't care much for was Peta Wilson as Mina Harker. The characters in general are also not that appealing. Now, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" unsurprisingly does have great special effects, and I can imagine how great they must have looked on the big screen, but this is not enough to make up for the major flaws in the film. Since starring in this 2003 fantasy, Sean Connery has not appeared in any more live action roles. He provided the voice of James Bond in the ""James Bond 007: From Russia with Love"" video game, and is starring in an upcoming animated film called ""Sir Billi"" after voicing the same character in a short called ""Sir Billi the Vet"", but it appears his days of live acting are over, as he confirmed his retirement several years ago. After decades of acting in front of the camera, I guess ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" marked the end, and this movie was not exactly a good way for Connery to go out, but fortunately, he certainly did have a good run. Anyway, I don't know how popular this film adaptation is with those who are familiar with the comic book series and graphic novel, but I certainly didn't find it very entertaining, and can understand why it didn't get the greatest reception of all the action blockbusters from the past decade.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Millions squandered on an excess of silly special effects to render a pointless story even more annoying. I scored this a 1 out of 10 because zeros aren't allowed. The blame lies on the shoulders of Sean Connery who co-produced this film. Think about it: Connery rejected James Bond because he thought the character and stories were beneath his dignity. I always gave Connery credit for how he was seduced back into the Bond role for the Diamonds Are Forever film. Rejecting $8 million for artistic reasons, the producers approached Connery as to how if he personally didn't need another $8 million, they'd set up a scholarship fund to educate so many Scot youngsters in college every year for decades.

91,gregsrants,A good film...even if I am the only person that thinks so.,6,16 May 2004,"Every year, a movie critic will recommend a film that will alienate them from their peers.  I remember Roger Ebert praising Blame it on Rio in 1984 when other critics were not only giving it the thumbs down treatment but they were professing they would chop their thumbs off as to not give the impression that the movie even deserved a digit.It's not all that uncommon nowadays to find a critic that likes even the most putrid of film.  Scary Movie 3, Duplex and even Gigli found at least a handful of critics who's kind words were posted on marquees and movie posters about town.In 2003, I found my Blame in on Rio with Sean Connery's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (LXG).  The film was based on the comic book and boasted a group of eclectic heroes including Allan Quartermain (Connery), Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, Dorian Gray, Mr. Hyde (and his alter-ego), The Invisible Man and a female vampire.  Recruited by the British Government to fight the Fantom who is trying to profit from the initiation of a World War, the LXG set sail upon the Nautilus to various locations around the globe in efforts to thwart the evil empire and restore peace on the brink of war.LXG was everything I expected it to be and maybe that is why I was so forgiving of its shortcomings.  I was not anticipating a clever rouse nor was I hoping this was a poor mans X-Men.  I knew the characters were obscure and that the director, Stephen Norrington, had a small resume and must have been pinching himself to be given a Connery vehicle with a $78 million dollar budget.  So with that knowledge, I found myself relaxed in my theatre chair.  No pressure, just looking to be entertained.  And on that level of understanding, I found LXG to be enjoyable.  I appreciated the production values, marvelled at the set designs and gave credit to the depiction of Dr. Jekyll as being a mammoth beast that was a paint job away from being the 19th century Hulk.  Sure, the notion of these characters having the technology of a submarine, a car and even sonar in the Victorian Age is ridiculous, but the movie does not try and explain or justify these ideas.  In fact, its lack of seriousness in both situation and dialogue, led to a playfulness that I appreciated.I will concede that now that I have viewed the film a few times on DVD, I shake my head a few times wondering what I must have initially thought over a few scenes that play more like a cut scene from Mystery Men than something I would be recommending, however as a whole, the film still plays like a foolish summer filler where all the characters are stretches and enough things go boom' to keep me glued to the action in front of me.I don't suggest the LXG is for everyone.

Connery coasts through proceedings on the strength of his established screen persona, while scene-stealer Stuart Townsend (QUEEN OF THE DAMNED) camps it up as a dandified Dorian Gray whose skirmishes with vampire/ex-girlfriend Mina Harker (Peta Wilson, TV's ""La Femme Nikita"") are charged with sexual tension - these characters surely deserve a movie of their own! Sadly, the film is undermined by a mediocre villain, whose lack of visual presence leaves a significant hole in the narrative.

94,silvermistvio,"People think it's bad, but personally, I've enjoyed.",6,25 May 2019,"A lot of people think that this film is such a bad film and so, they give a lot of bad reviews and low rates. But as for me, it's kind of enjoyable.As the name of the film, some people in this film are kind of different (but in extraordinary way). What I love is this. Instead of a normal ordinary drama film, seeing those kinds of different and extraordinary people is better. Sci-fi film is the most difficult thing to create. A normal film is very easy to do. Even I can do some drama and romance films. But Sci-fi is different. They need creativity, a big mind to think and create such a different thing. On the other hand, they need a great effort on special effects too. An ordinary drama rarely needs special effects. Hence no extra costs on special effects. They just need to have a good film editor. But as for Sci-fi films, because they aren't things that we used to do and we normally see, so, we need to create specially and deliberately. Thus, those kinds of Sci-fi films need not only a good film editors, but also directors and special effects creators. That's why Sci-fi films are more valuable because they are very high in terms of budget. And also because they need to have a great special effects creators, hence, those films become more difficult ones to create.Although this film is not that much of Sci-fi films and it's not ordinary film, I like the fact that there are a lot of extraordinary people. Who I like the most is Mr. Skinner because he's invisible guy. If only he gets naked, no one can see him. I always try not to imagine the way he's naked though. LOL. 😂😂😂As for conclusion of this review, although people think this film is too bad, as for me, I kind of enjoyed it.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
95,rebeljenn,Fun action film,7,14 January 2006,"This is not a great film, but 'The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen' is packed full of action. It's the type of film that you can go to the cinema to watch and get caught up in the action, fantasy, and adventure. The alliance and the cast of unusual characters in this alliance help the story, and it has pretty much everything the fan of fantasy-adventure or superhero films could ever want in a film. There were a few problems with this film, and I had trouble with some of the realism. For example, the Nautilus could never travel down the grand canal in Venice because it is too large, and the Grand Canal in Venice is really not very large, and it's got bridges across it. Despite this problem and similar ones, it's not a bad film. It's fun, and it was worth a couple of hours and dollars to watch.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
96,RonellSowes,Extra ordinary film,3,1 November 2020,"It's a shame that this had to be the pathetic end of Sean Connery's career.The concept of The League Of Extraordinary Gentleman is rather outlandish featuring characters from: King Solomons Mines,The Picture Of Dorian,The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer and sequels, The Strange Case Of Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde,The Invisible Man,Dracula,20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,Moby Dick,Casino Royale,The Phantom Of The Opera and Sherlock Holmes series.The movie is primarily composed of lengthy,ludicrous action sequences with some expository scenes in between. Not to mention some quips from Connery's character that may have been added in an attempt to imitate the James Bond films but are neither witty nor funny and fall flat on their face-as the rest of this film does.Aside from Sir Sean Connery there are very few redeeming features in this cartoonish,over the top mess and is certainly one of his worst films.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
97,raymond-15,So much work with so little satisfaction,6,25 October 2004,"At the outset it seemed like a good original idea to draw characters from well-known stories and have them combine their efforts into preventing a dangerous world war. However the result was far from pleasing. It resulted in an unholy mess of silly scenes where time and place seemed quite irrelevant while gunfire, explosions and falling masonry seemed to predominate.Good acting and interesting stories seem to have given way to masses of computerised effects which as clever as they are somehow end up boring particularly if they are used too much.Dorian Gray, Jekyll and Hyde, the invisible man and Captain Nemo with his gigantic Nautilus are just some of the league members. I thought including a woman (and a vampire at that) did not fit the general theme. May be she was included to create some sort of sex interest. But who would want to kiss the bloody mouth of a vampire? Dorian Gray certainly aged. It seemed he was dug up from his grave and as for Mr. Hyde he was a ""mountain of mad flesh"" as Shakespeare would say. The mixture he drank sure was potent. The naked invisible man was cleverly conceived. Only half his face was visible...the part that had white face cream on it. The Nautilus thrusting its way along the shallow canals of Venice was pure fantasy, but it looked good. If only any of this were possible.Sean Connery was Sean Connery with clear diction, something to be prized these days when so many actors mumble their words. He was no mean marksman too. I reckon he could shoot off the head of a pin at a thousand yards or so. The secret he says is being able to relax which is somewhat difficult with all the noise and confusion in this fantasy.Teenagers no doubt will enjoy this film as they would a pile of old comics, but as far as adult entertainment goes. I think it would be better to look a little further.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
98,tomimt,One of those which could have been better,5,1 May 2005,"I hadn't yet read the original comic books when I first heard of this movie. I thought: interesting. Then I grabbed those comics and I got exited: they were funny, clever and well written. Seemingly adventurous, but still more profound than meets the eye after first reading. The movie makers had a perfect material in their hands, mixing up all greatest fictional characters created in a creative manner.But then the movie came and I found, that the movie wast just a shallow shell from what the comics were. It's not terrible, mind you, it just could be helluva lot better.First mistake was, that they changed the leader of the group from Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) to Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery). That would have been okay, but then they changed the whole character of Quatermain: In the comic he was an old man, obsessed from the death of his family, who in his grief was driven to use opium in order to get away from the pain. It takes a while in the comic from Quatermain to actually be of any use because of his drug habit.Then we have the invisible man (Tony Curran), who surprise, Surprise is also a lite version from the original comic character. in the movie he's just a brick, but in the comic he was a brick as well as a sexual pervert, who used his invisibility skills to rape women. Not very heroic trait, but then again he was invisible, so he was necessary for the group.As for appearances go, Jekyll/Hyde was the same hulking creature that he was in the comic, but here the movie makers have made him more likable. Hyde is supposed to be strong, clever and mean. Now he was just a goon.And Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah). He, and his hatred towards colonial Brits made him my favourite character in the comic. He was mean, lean killing machine if he wanted to. Now, all of this wasn't completely lost, but then again he never got that much of screen time to prove anything.Most unnecessary additional character was Tom Sawyer (Shane West), who had a personality of loving puppy dog, who always ran in the heels of his master, Quatermain. If some strange force makes it necessary to makers of this film to make it a sequel I see him rising to be Quatermain lite.Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) was only interesting character in the whole movie, but as I seem to recall he wasn't quite as invulnerable as it is displayed in the movie. But he is certainly interesting in his whole immortality bit.As I personally see it this movie could have been light years better if they just would have been using the story line from the comics, as they were without no doubt better. Still, as action flicks go, this can be watched once, but don't expect it to find it's way into my DVD shelf. Unless I stumble upon it when it's in discount. Like a euro or two.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
99,timdalton007,A Steampunk Action Movie,7,5 June 2016,"Since its initial release, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen has been a film with a less than stellar reputation. Receiving mixed to negative reviews upon release, it has been seen as a poor adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel as well as the final cinema appearance of Sean Connery. Yet looking at the film both then and now would suggest that there's more to the film than meets the eye and that it might, in fact be better than its reputation may suggest.Let's be honest up front though: this is a film with issues. If you've read the graphic novel you'll likely spot pretty quickly that the film bares only the faintest resemblance to it. Many of the characters are present within it pages but many of the incidents portrayed in the film most certainly are not. So if you're going into this expecting a faithful adaptation of Moore's graphic novel, you're in for a disappointment.The film has other issues as well. The quality of the special effects are variable from excellent (in the case of invisible man Rodney Skinner or the Jekyll/Hyde transformations) to middling (which is essentially anywhere CGI is used). Indeed the CGI used in the film looks iffy in places even by 2003 standards with it being very obvious when a CGI version of Hyde is appearing versus a more convincing prosthetic. Perhaps nothing though has come in for more criticism than the script. The late critic Robert Ebert cited the script for featuring ""incomprehensible action, idiotic dialogue, inexplicable motivations, causes without effects, effects without causes, and general lunacy."" He's not wrong in some places with the plot for the first half or so of the film suffering from exactly that (especially towards the middle of the film as revelations pile up and one wonders why characters have done certain things). It's not a perfect script by any means but I think Ebert did it something of a disservice. Plain and simple, this is an action film. It's interesting to watch today because really this is The Avengers in Victorian times. It's a film about a team of extraordinary individuals being brought together to fight a larger threat, the friction between them, betrayals, romances and plenty of action. The film even turns Jekyll/Hyde into Bruce Banner/The Hulk! It's a Victorian superhero movie and quite an effective one.The film's action sequences can be quite effective. The various fist-fights are all well staged while the film also features a range of other action set-pieces including chases through Paris and Venice and a running series of sequences towards the end of the film. In a way it's a shame that the film's plot isn't stronger to show off the action sequences better with the various sequences having to effectively hold up the poor structure of the film.Move past the sometimes iffy CGI used and the sets and costumes are also quite effective. Both bring not so much the proper Victorian aesthetic but what can be termed as steampunk. It's a slightly more high-tech version of that era but one that is visually appealing and which makes some of the film's events a bit more plausible. From a steampunk point of view, the film is a showcase for what the genre can do on the cinema screen.Of course there's the performances as well. The role of Allan Quatermain would be Connery's last but all things considered he could have done far worse as here is a man in his seventies holding his own with actors a fraction of his age. Connery's presence (both literally and figuratively) anchors the film nicely and Connery not only gets to show off his action chops but play both a team leader and a father figure as well. It's also Connery's skill for throwing away one- liners than makes some of the film's comedic lines work well. What is on showcase here might not so much be Connery the actor but Connery the action star in his last hurrah.The rest of the cast does pretty well given the script they're handed. Tony Curran's Rodney Skinner probably comes off the best out of the cast, playing up the comedy of the invisible man role and becomes a scene-stealer in the process. Peta Wilson's Mina Harker is the only major female role in the film and she becomes a fine foil for Connery's Quartermain as well as an effective presence in the film. Shane West makes for an effective Dorian Gray, playing up the cockiness and amoral elements of Oscar Wilde's most famous character. Both Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo and Jason Flemyng as Jekyll/Hyde are underused though the film touches upon interesting elements of each character that never quite get explored in full (indeed there's a scene between them that feels as if it will that seems to be missing a large chunk out of it). Rounding out the League is the aforementioned Tom Sawyer played by Shane West who is mentored by Connery's Quatermain and is actually an interesting addition as the youngest and perhaps most reckless member of the team. The team then is quite well assembled all things considered with Richard Roxburgh rounding off the cast is an interesting role that is ill-written at times but that he does quite well with.As a film then, The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen isn't a masterpiece. It has issues with its script and production values to be sure but it is far from the disastrous film its reputation suggests (indeed it actually made money at the box-office believe it or not). It's a fun steampunk superhero movie that sees an icon in one last hurrah playing the kind of role he is best known for. As that kind of film, it's an utter joy to watch and one that's a great way of passing a rainy afternoon. So give it a go and enjoy it for what it is.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
100,roedyg,Sean Connery's Biggest Embarrassment,4,19 November 2007,"This is a special effects movie. If you enjoy watching miniatures of Venice topple, or explosions, or fights you might not get bored past the first 30 minutes. In general, the effects lack imagination. Dr. Jekyl gnashes his teeth and thrashes his head about with about as much purpose (and smoothness) as Godzilla. It went on and on. I kept thinking the movie was over, and it would arise from the ashes to stumble on with more of the same. It was like a American Idol contestant doggedly insisting on a dozen curtain calls even when no one applauded.The thing I enjoyed most was the imaginative primitive technology -- the television powered by a wax cylinder, and the knife-like submarine with the decorative iron scroll work.The best special effect was an invisible man wearing a bit of face cream so that just a thin mask hovered in space, an effect borrowed from Spielberg's 2001 movie AI. Another was the heroine wraithe commanding the bats of Venice to attack the wicked. Some of the other effects were an embarrassment for a movie filmed in 2003, reminiscent of George and Marion, the ghosts in the 50s TV show Topper, simulated by dangling a letter-opener on a fish line.The plot makes no sense, just an excuse for endless fight scenes. The characters are as one-dimensional as second string comic book superheroes. Edited down to 15 minutes, it would be great fun.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

102,Bogmeister,The Retro-League of Justice and Secret Agents,6,27 November 2007,"MASTER PLAN: take over the world, basically. This film captures a flavor, in a bottle as it were, of that brief period just after the Victorian Age and just before the 20th century modernization enveloped most of the world. The world here seems to be on the cusp of unveiling all sorts of modern marvels and gizmos, similar to the taste of, for example, ""The Assassination Bureau"" film of the sixties. Otherwise, there is very little similarity between the two films. This one also takes the later super-hero premise, wraps it with some James Bond-style action and, utilizing a lot of computer FX, retrofits the old heroes of the 19th century to fit the mold of their 20th century descendants; the old heroes, who were copied by the later super-heroes, are now revamped to imitate the 20th century super-heroes - a complete circle, as it were. This is based on the graphic novels (comic books) of famed writer Alan Moore, who had a more cynical and edgy take on these heroes. In his original version, old hero Quatermain had become an opium addict and prim Mina Harker did not hide her disgust at the hero's degeneration. By contrast, the film versions of these characters are more bland and more heroic - Peta Wilson is still very enticing as the now superhuman Mina but Connery, the ex-James Bond himself, evidently quite taken with his own heroic standing, refused to succumb to such a malady on film. And, indeed, such a fallen hero may have dragged down a 2-hour film; this is another instance of the so-called comic books presenting a more rich and layered version of a story (the ""Daredevil"" comic books vs. the film also come to mind), probably because they have the luxury of exploring the characters over the course of several months in a series of graphic issues.On the surface, at least, much of what Alan Moore presented has been transposed faithfully to film: Quatermain is recruited, along with several other unusual gentlemen and one lady, for a mission to save the world. Captain Nemo and his wondrous sub-marine, the sneaky Invisible Man and the very brutish Mr. Hyde are all here, as well as a couple of others. One of them may be a traitor - this is somewhat new. But, they and the sleek sub are all marginally interesting. The main villain, the Fantom, who has unlimited resources of men and mechanical power at his disposal, turns out to be another infamous nemesis from famous literature. Some may think that Hyde was overdone with use of the FX, but he does resemble the graphic novel version - a retro version of the Hulk, huge and beastly - though he was not allowed to dismember as much on screen. No, the overuse of computer FX is in the spectacular scenes of destruction and ignorance of common physics - this is where it strays too far into silly comic book land. Connery as Quatermain, for example, is in good shape for his age and suitably heroic, but when he jumps from a fancy automobile which is moving at 50 mph, he lands on his feet as if he'd just stepped off a porch. So, you realize in such moments, you really are in some alternate universe, not in a stylized 1898 or 1899 as first presented. Viewed in such a context, it's an acceptable adventure, with enough thrills and climactic derring-do to keep a viewer at least slightly intrigued. I will say, too, the villain's ultimate goal was intriguing; I picture a platoon of invisible men, a brigade of Hydes. It made me wonder about a sequel, briefly. I was, however, more intrigued by the more sophisticated graphic novel version. Ah, well.

Since I had not read his work on the League, I thought I would try seeing it first.You can see glimmers of his genius, but you have to look beyond the excessive cgi and fight scenes. Indeed this felt like a trip to a Universal Studios more than an intricately written story all too often. And not the stuntmen will fall off the building while on fire....yawn.Of all the characters, I thought the Jekyll/Hyde was the most engaging, but in that you have a very *obvious* case of a hero battling with his inner villain. Hell, much of the time his villainous side gets to run amuck on the outside. I did not feel much camaraderie between the League...I wonder if Connery actually spent any time with his fellow actors off camera. The DVD extras made it sound like Sean didn't get the story, but didn't want to miss out on the next Matrix. Ah, to be that rich and still snub your nose at the art of your work!Well, I'll get the graphic novel and enjoy that in a couple of weeks (blessings upon our solid library system here...).I am curious to see if the graphic novel tries so hard to leave the crypt open to a sequel as this very ordinary film did.4/10For other lapsed Moore fans, I did finally see ""From Hell"" and I thought that was well realized, with its own fine touches.

105,movieguy1021,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: 3/10,3,7 August 2003,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is anything but. In fact, Stephen Norrington's Gentlemen is so contrived, boring, and dull, it's like watching paint dry while listening to a broken record of Gilbert Gottfried's greatest jokes. Also, Sean Connery is not only too old, but will likely be compared to George W. Bush (`I'm waiting to be impresshed'). Face it, Sean, you're too old to do films like you're used to. Your role in Finding Forrester was probably too much of an action strain for you. If seeing a stuntman who looks like Sean Connery on a bad day, with different colors of hair, kick the crap out of some badly animated creature, than I think Gentlemen is all for you. If you're like me and like stories that not only make sense but have some action and suspense, go see T3 or something.What surprises me is not only the lack of depth of the characters, who James Dale Robinson expects us all to know (if someone flocks to a mindless summer action movie, should they know famous literary characters?), but how much I didn't care about them. I tried to like it for the first fifteen minutes, but then I just gave up. Who cares about who the traitor is? Not only is it as obvious as a clown juggling loaded sniper rifles, but I just didn't care. I can tolerate stupidity, but stupidity added to absurdity is just preposterous. And this isn't even good stupidity, a la Johnny English or something of the sort. This is just bad stupidity.20th Century Fox is almost as bad as Universal nowadays. Not only is all of the action faker than Britney Spears, but it tries to be so cool, when it's anything but. I think guns shoot bullets, not just bright yellow lights. Gentlemen had some of the worst lighting I've ever seen in my life. At times it was too dark to see anything, while other times lights were flashing in my eyes. It was worse than staring at a strobe light for hours on end. Also, the sound was louder than the trailer for 2 Fast 2 Furious, and I swear I'm deaf now. Maybe I'll download pirated movies now, so those light and sound people don't get their paychecks and never work in movies again!Now I don't know the special `powers' of Allan Quatermain (Connery) (even though they tried to explain it multiple times), but I think being shot at point-blank range would kill somebody. If I understood it correctly, he's undefeatable, but so were half of the other Extraordinary Gentlemen. Also, I don't recall when swords usually beat automatic weapons during battle.Connery does a terrifically terrible job as Quatermain. He's trying to prove to Hollywood that he can still be a leading man, although nobody's cared about him since the end of his Bond movies. Also, with his accent, which makes his dialogue even hammier, he can't deliver any humor. The whole movie can't hold anything. Its sorry attempts at humor were really bad. I smiled once at one innuendo, but that's it. The whole movie's failed. It has failed attempts at action, failed FX, failed acting, failed humor, and it basically failed at the box-office. However, it didn't do bad enough to stop them from making The Second League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.My rating: 3/10Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence, language and innuendo.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
106,0w0,"An 8/10 movie, but the plot-holes ruin it",5,20 May 2020,"There's several plot-holes, most of which involve the 'good guys' letting the 'bad guys' escape multiple times instead of just killing them. This goes for the 'bad guys' vs. the 'good guys' as well... they let them live multiple times when they could just have killed them. If the plot-holes weren't put in the movie, then this would have been a pretty damn good superhero movie for its time.This movie is The Avengers, before The Avengers actually was made into a movie... Overall it's an OK movie, which could have been a great movie if only the writers weren't so lazy by leaving so many plot-holes in the movie.PS. I see they're remaking/rebooting this movie, with a full female cast? Well that's going to flop harder than what this one did!

107,Antagonisten,Entertaining no-brainer,6,11 February 2005,"Sometimes movies are just so bad they become good. It's so silly it's entertaining. Or maybe it's just the fact that someone somewhere had a lot of fun making the movie, and even though it's not really good the good vibrations still show? This is one of those movies.It's an alternative 1899 and the world is on the brink of war. Villains are trying to start a war between the nations of Europe. A league of heroes is gathered to fight the threat. Among them adventurer Allen Quatermain, the invisible man, Mina Harker, Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll (and of course Mr. Hyde) etc.I have not read the comic this movie is based on. Apparently the movie has changed the story and characters quite a bit. But since i have no knowledge of the comic i intend to judge the movie on it's own merit.I have to admit, i had a lot of fun watching this movie. I think that much can be said about the quality of director Stephen Norringtons movies. But still, it seems he's a director that really enjoys directing, which also makes the movies entertaining! This movie is a playful and VERY comic-book like ride. To enjoy this you have to drop more or less ALL demands on realism and cohesion. There are cars in 1899 driving on roads in Venice where there are no roads! Huge submarines circling the globe in days, automatic weapons that seem equal to the ones we use today. Not to mention all the blunt goofs in the movie (i won't mention them, it's so much more fun to look for them while watching the movie!).So, even though this is far from the most well-made comic-book action i have seen this year it's still entertaining. I think that people judge this movie too hard. People demand perfection and strict adherence to normal conventions of script-writing and movie-making. But this movie lets go of that and tries instead to just be an entertaining no-brainer. And i think it succeeds. I rate it 6/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The concept behind it is very intriguing: a superteam of characters from Victorian literature.  Ever since I heard about the plans to adapt the comic into a movie, I was excited to see the end results.  Now, the movie is here, and I am very pleased.  Sean Connery leads the cast as Allan Quatermain. The visual imagery in the movie is wonderful, especially the art direction seen on the Nautilus.  I loved all the literary references as well.

109,SquigglyCrunch,The Cool Idea Wasn't Enough to Save This Movie,2,31 January 2016,"Having watched this movie years ago and loving it, I decided that it was time for another watch. Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be very disappointing. The plot of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was pretty unoriginal. A bunch of special people have to stop some evil dude before he destroys something. It's been used to death, but it works. Unfortunately, everything else is presented poorly. The characters are, to put it lightly, awful. There's so little development that you can't help but cringe every time they try to make you care about them or are presented with some sort of obstacle. I just didn't care what happened to them. If they all died it wouldn't have affected my view on the movie at all. Most of the characters felt like they existed for a single purpose too, such as providing a cool rifle for the main character or providing transportation for everyone. Furthermore a lot of the characters had useless skills. Considering the time in which the movie takes place, it seems rather inconvenient that someone would still use swords and his fists to fight when everyone's packing a machine gun. Yet somehow, it works, and it doesn't make a wink of sense. Some characters also had inconsistencies with their powers, specifically Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. Part of why the characters sucked was because of how poorly paced it is. The first half-hour is spent getting all the characters together, the next half-hour has some ""character development"" and ""plot"", and the last hour is just the climax. So there's barely any time for anything but the ending, which unfortunately wasn't that good anyway. The movie barely gave itself any time to develop anything, which is one reason why it struggled so much. The special effects are absolute trash. Maybe for the time they were good, but nowadays they are unbearably bad. Now maybe that's unfair criticism considering when this movie came out, but it still stood out to me enough for it to be distracting. And considering they didn't have to animate everything is also distracting (like the wavy black cloak. It's a cloak, just make one instead of making a CGI one).The movie is extremely predictable. Now that may be because I'd seen it already, but it was years ago, and even now I notice that even if I hadn't seen it the events would have been the most blatantly obvious thing in the world. Now there was one unpredictable part, which was the twist ending. But it's presented so horribly that I actually didn't even understand it until a few minutes later when they had to explain it. The best twist endings are those that don't require an explanation, but when there's so little focus on it in the first place and then BOOM! It shows up again and it's the twist, you left scratching your head thinking ""So what? What's the big deal?"" until the movie has to explain it to you, at which point you say ""Oh, okay"". The twist doesn't make you freak out, even when it's explained, because you just don't care, and you have no reason to care. It would have been better if they just forgot the twist ending and moved on with the ""story"", because at least it wouldn't feel so dang cliché, nor would I have been nearly as confused. One thing I did like was the idea of a bunch of fictional characters from classic stories coming together in a team. It's sort of like the Avengers only none of these characters have anything to do with each other. It feels more like a giant fanfiction crossover, but that's not always a bad thing. In the way that this movie tried to approach it was good, but everything else suffered. Also I really liked the title. It's long and doesn't tell you exactly what the movie will be about. By that I mean it doesn't explain what the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is in the title, but it sounds cool so it gets you curious about it. It's a bit misleading though because there is a woman in it. Overall The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen had a few small cool things about it, but everything else was extremely lacking. It was predictable, poorly developed in every way, fake-looking, and oddly (and poorly) paced. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you want to either ruin your great childhood memories of it or if your just curious as to how it holds up.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

It is almost absolute piffle but I don't think it pretends to be anything else. The whole premise is nonsense of course but you only have to read the synopsis to understand that. There is far too little characterisation and far too much CGI for my liking but it is, I say grudgingly, fun. It is that sort of movie. I find it strange that Connery would do this, but he is the name that sold it, I suppose, plus he is on the production side too. it is completely over the top but the viewer who likes this sort of thing wants that too. it is a boys own adventure, though it is strange that among the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a sexy vampire female. I could see this being done so much better though, with more in depth character studies as well as extreme action. Overall I am surprised it was such a flop at the cinema.

I never did quite understand the objectives of the bad guys in this one.. The film features some fun set pieces, but on the whole the storyline doesnt really make much sense and the film only works as well as it does because of the personal charm of Connery and some of the other actors.

It is sad to say this because I love a lot of literature stories involving the characters in this movie, but this movie stinks. No one has ever disputed that.That being said, there are a few things that I do like in this movie:
1. The work done on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is pretty great. This movie has horrible CGI (which I won't hold against it for the time) but Mr. Hyde was was all prosthetic and his transformations and design looked really great.2. I like the characters. Cheesy lines and bad directing, but the characters were still likable. I really wish they could re-do this movie somehow, but go for a more serious tone.Maybe I should stick with the books.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Together, they are the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.LXG shows that some attempt has been made into making it into an excellent superhero film, but unfortunately fails in different areas. The story has had a decent attempt on it with twists and the revealing of characters early on, but what really lets the film down is the lack of detail that each character has. With so many hero characters together on screen for most of the film, the script lacks any true detail which really makes any of the characters that interesting.Shall I wait, Captain?  Ishmael (Terry O'Neill) No, bring my lady to me.  Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah)",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

115,SkullScreamerReturns,"Great story, average movie",5,21 September 2021,"Rumour says that Sean Connery quit his acting career just because he was ashamed of this movie. I don't know if there's any truth to that story but it says something about the reputation of this film; almost everybody says it's terrible.I watched it but it wasn't as bad as I expected. I haven't read the original graphic novel, so I was probably being more merciful towards the movie because of not having big expectations.The characters and story are interesting, so at least some good qualities from the source material transcend to the movie. I just got the feeling that I want to read the original because it's probably even better. The concept of taking classic characters from literature and putting them into a same group is excellent.The movie also has a lot of action and I think that is the weaker part. The action scenes were not terrible but often quite chaotic and could have been directed better. I got the feeling that if the movie focused more on the characters and drama, and less on action, it would have been better. Now it became a bit mediocre action adventure when it could have been something greater.The special effects look quite dated but also strangely fascinating. The computer effects (like the Nautilus submarine) create somehow alien and surreal feel at times. I liked the overall look of the film, which looked very...well, comic book style. Like it should be.I think it's a decent flick if adventure and superhero films are your favorite things. But if you are a huge fan of Alan Moore then be prepared it's probably not as good as you wish for. But it sure is not any kind of ""worst ever"" thing! Just a bit mediocre.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
116,moviemanMA,The League of SO MUCH Potential,6,17 July 2005,"Sean Connery is a very distinguished actor. He has appeared in several great films spanning decades. He was the original 007 James Bond and has since made his mark on the American Cinema. His way or presenting a line is uncanny. Connery is a real hero. His character Allan Quartermain is no different.The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen shows the world during the turn of the century, 1900. The dawn of a new era is about to begin as the world changes into the industrial, mechanized age. New technologies are being developed and Europe is gripped with terror. The man known as ""The Fantom"" is toying with England and Germnay, starting what seems like a war between the two. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Allan Quartermain is picked to lead a team of select individuals on an expedition to find and stop ""The Fantom"". Allan is teamed up with Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Tom Sawyer (Shane West), Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), Dr. Jekyll (and Mr. Hyde; Jason Flemyng), and Rodney Skinner known as ""The Invisible Man"" (Tony Curran).This movie features a team of famous characters of literature that suit this period. The idea for the film is very ingenious. Most movies of heroes and people with special talents center around figures from today, not from yesterday. Although some of the characters might not be recognizable to children, they don't really have to know about them. This isn't the best kids movie, with scenes of intense action and some not too pleasant graphics (Dr Jekyll to Mr. Hyde transformation). This movie could have been so much more. For some reason it just didn't click. The cast does an OK job of bringing these characters to life, but there was room for improvement. Sometimes the effects overtake the story and bring down the whole movie.It is an enjoyable movie but isn't for everyone. It's a good adventure and a decent picture all together. It's nothing to special but it doesn't hurt to watch. Connery is good as the aging Quartermain and with the father/son relationship with West, there is more to just the cat and mouse adventure. LXG is a pleasant film that could have been truly extraordinary.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
117,Flagrant-Baronessa,An impossible mish-mash of fantasy literature,5,18 August 2006,"The comic book/graphic novel trend is sizzling is Hollywood right now, where filmmakers take on big projects like Sin City (2005), V for Vendetta (2005) and Batman Begins (2005) and attempt to translate them to the silver screen. If there is anything to learn from The Simpsons it's that comic book fans are loyal and mean a great deal of box office gross for these adaptations when they hit cinemas. Now director Stephen Norrington has jumped on the bandwagon and breathes life into the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novels by Alan Moore. League of Gentlemen is a film that, due to its disjointed writing is relegated to a bad fate with critics. Perhaps this is rightly so, because it really is a babble of crazy film-making. Imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of famous literary characters like Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray and Allan Quatermain, cram dozens of story lines, plot twists, one-liners, explosions and weapons in it and then fire into a random mess. Then you have your film in a nutshell. Is it any good? Not really. Is it entertaining? Hell yes. But then, I have always had great affection for films in which characters with different skills team up to a accomplish a goal, whether it is a heist, a mission or winning a boxing title. Here we have the mission part taken care of. A mysterious leader called ""M"" recruits a league of literary figures to save the world (heh, get it? ""M"" recruits Sean Connery) and these colourful people are our main characters that we follow, lending their eccentric skills like vampirism and invisibility to the job. This is a film that does not offer much in the way of atmosphere, tension or foreshadowing, but rather dishes out huge doses of violence to keep your interest. In fact, the first scene in the film opens as a fight sequence -- not really engrossing because we know nothing of the struggle behind it. This is mostly true for the whole film. We never quite feel for the characters because there are too many of them to get to know and too little time to do it. It instead compensates with action and lots of it. Special effects are uneven, but always satisfactory.I think this film is best likened to Pirates of the Caribbean or Batman and Robin -- a great big mess often bordering on campy, but never quite getting there. Not as bad as it will have you believe, but DEFINITELY not a good movie by any means. 5/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The effects were assume, the cast did a great job. No matter what critics say. The story works and I love the blend of literature characters that litter the film. Just one thing, one tiny mistake. Mina Harker was saved when Dracula was killed. She never fully transformed, if they wanted a female vampire, it should have been Lucy.

Sean Connery is the only major star (and is PERFECT as an aging John Quatermain) but the other actors are well-suited to their roles... portraying famous fictional characters from Victorian-era literature who, it is alleged in this story, became something of a ""superhero group"" near the turn of the century.  Certainly the movie is a ""dumbed down"" version of the very literary comic book upon which it was based... but there are lots of choice lines of dialogue to be heard.  The action set pieces are imaginative and lively for the most part (only a car chase thru the ""streets"" of Venice seems superfluous... and ridiculous). Lots of literary ""in-jokes"" provide moments of amusement, too.  I mean, I wouldn't say the movie is the best action movie EVER... or even as good as it COULD HAVE been... but it is not at all deserving of some of the viciously brutal criticism that it has gotten.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Sure it's clichéd and contrived, and the dialogue is laughable but that makes it that much more fun. I'm quite pleased by seeing Dorian Gray (one of my all time favorite literary characters), Tom Sawyer and Mr. Hyde together on screen. Also, I think that the cast was chosen quite well as they seemed to perfectly fit their parts. The fact that most of them were relatively unknown certainly helped. The technical aspects were pretty poor and that dialogue did get a bit cringe-worthy at times but overall it's just a really fun time and nothing more.

Captain Nemo a swordsman, Mina Harker a vampire, Rodney Skinner an invisible man, Dorian Gray an immortal, Dr. Henry Jekyll; and his alter ego Hyde and Tom Sawyer, a gunman from America.The League of Extraordinary Gentle is an exercise of bad film making. The entire plot and story is so convoluted, taking itself way to seriously. With so many comic book adaptation released, it's hard to see why this got everything so wrong. There is no emotional contact to the characters, the plot is a one note beat; with a constant run of over the top action and a script that is severely underdeveloped. The dialog is so dreadful; so many bad one liners that are cringe worthy. The use of landmark characters from literature, feels insulting to their creators. Stephen Norrington's directing is severely heavy handed; it almost clumsy in the action, with bad editing on top of it.Lots of money had to be thrown at this movie. The redeeming facet of brilliant set designs and costumes, it has great visual aesthetic. So why pound all the money into the surroundings and costumes, when they could have spent time developing a much better script; it's not even half baked. James Robinson has kept the dialog in comic book style; which can work, but sounds so wrong here, with bad deliverance by the actors.The acting doesn't help either. Sean Connery delivers one of his worst roles in his career. Naseeruddin Shah face is set in stone. Tony Curran is irritating, failing to bring that cheekiness to Rodeny. Shane West takes himself to seriously. Peta Wilson and Jason Flemyng have flashes of good moments before falling with the rest of the cast. Presenting the only good performance is Stuart Townsend.

It took me back to the Saturday afternoon adventure serials when I was a kid, at a time when you paid twenty-five cents to see an ""A"" feature, a ""B"" feature, a newsreel, a cartoon and a serial adventure. What makes this such a fun romp is the humor of the piece with the pithy and witty dialog, the reverent tributes to dozens of nineteenth century and earlier adventure characters, and of course the actors themselves. The aging but still ever dynamic Sean Connery once more proves why he has been so watchable for the past five decades. One of the things that has marked his many performances is the way he does not seem to take himself seriously, while he does honor to each character. While the rest of the cast is not maybe as well known, they all managed to bring a great deal of fun to their performances. This is not a great classic of Cinema, and will never return an Oscar, but taken for what it is, it succeeds well. If you don't enjoy this one, then you either need to get out more or you need a humor transplant.

Some people hadn't seen it; others saw it and weren't too pleased. After what seemed like a year, I gave it a try and enjoyed it. It's hardly an Oscar contender, but it's not what I'd call bad either. I'd discussed this movie with some of my friends who had seen it, and I came to the conclusion that it was a good idea hindered by lousy execution. They all agreed with me. And even if you don't know the characters, you can always look them up later and/or read the books from where they come. This may not be the best movie, but I'll bet it makes youngsters interested in the classic novels of the Victorian era. LXG may not be for young children, but it's still interesting. Right before I saw the movie, I'd read the comic book. They both have their pros and cons, but in some ways I liked the movie because there was more action.All in all, I liked the idea of these different classic novel characters coming together to fight a common foe, but the way it was carried out just didn't click. Who knows, maybe we'll get a reboot or a TV show. That would probably do more justice. Still, LXG wasn't as bad as I thought it was. I don't think it's weird that I'd like to watch it more than once.

Of course there are people missing, say, Randolph Carter - from the Lovecraftian universe - however, this really couldn't be much better.

Because if it's reportedly ""bad"", you can sometimes be surprised, even if seldomly. Here, a great concept comes to life: Victorian literary characters join together in a stylized, industrial end of the century, and fight a common evil. Well, what shall we say about this? In the paper (aka graphic novel), it was genius - the cross between such different characters and past histories is really appealing. Then comes the special effects bonanza. And all hell breaks loose. This movie shows clearly Hollywood's way of thinking, and the way market-defined ""success"" sometimes fails - this was proven in ""Pearl Harbor"", this was proven in ""Batman and Robin"" and now one more time it shows here. One of the biggest flops in a year of blockbusters and in an era of never-before-seen movie-going, this ""League"" has really nothing of extraordinary, and many times verges on sheer lunacy - the Nautilus easily cruising in Venice's channels? Tom Sawyer a professional car driver in a time when there were no cars? And by the way, what is Tom Sawyer doing here? Anyway, the movie has its moments - the futuristic gadgets concocted by Capt. Nemo are really impressive (and Nautilus is the best looking character in the picture); the character of Dorian Gray is by far the most fun of characters. But then come the impossible amount of inconsistencies, the heart-breaking poorness of some special effects (Mr. Hyde and its nemesis are terribly realized, an automatized robot killer is clearly a man in a suit).

131,Shiva-11,Justice League 1900 - extremely ordinary guys and a gal,4,11 July 2003,"In the twilight months of the 19th Century a  madman known as `The Phantom' kidnaps the brightest minds of the time to develop the next generation of weapons.  Using this newfound arsenal, this evildoer carries out a series of attacks calculated to both the plunge the world's superpowers into a global conflict and produce a market ripe for arms dealing.  A group of `heroes' - each with his or her own special talents -  dubbed the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, is drawn together  to halt the impending cataclysm. As with all intrigue, some things are not what they seem, and betrayal is an essential element of the game.Unlike `The Hulk' or `Daredevil' - well-known comic heroes with a long lineage -  `The`League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' is a graphic novel, a niche market in the comic biz.  While the title may not spark instant recognition, the characters within undoubtedly will, drawn as they are from literature:  Allan Quartermain, Mina Harrker, and Dr. Jekyll but to name a few.  The movie, however bears only passing resemblance to Alan Moore's graphic novel and includes `extra' characters that appear to have been added to give an American angle (to boost potential box office?)If you enjoy watching Sean Connery manhandle people, then you will be well served: not since his days as Bond, James Bond (the one, the only in my humble opinion) has Connery kicked this much butt.  As crusty Allan Quartemain, Connery is truly in his element, delivering gruff lines and flippant humor  (`My, that was naughty')  almost single-handedly carrying the film.   Peta Wilson is appealing as Mina Harker, the devoted wife turned vamp by none other than the toothy Transylvanian Count.  Detemrined to be a force for serving good, she's  not averse to stopping for  a snack if the situation presents itself  (while Buffy might not approve they are bad guys after all aren't they?).  Stuart Townsend  is dashing and debonair as Dorian Grey, but, much like the film itself, lacks any real substance.
TLOEG (you try typing the title a few times.) suffers because there is so little to it: the story is weak, rambling and ultimately fails to stimulate your interest.  This is exacerbated by characters that don't mesh well, or simply don't make sense (sorry, but accepting Tom Sawyer as a  Secret Service agent is up there with believing in Santa Claus, and responsible government), lame, lifeless dialogue, and special effects that are of notoriously  variable quality.  Add misguided uber villains, horribly telegraphed surprises and an abysmal attempt at a sequel inspiring ending and there is little to root for.If you are a huge fan of the graphic novel, you'll undoubtedly be hugely disappointed.  If not, why bother at all?Matinee it at your own risk.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
132,rparham,Just ordinary,6,14 July 2003,"In a summer of comic book adaptations galore, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (known as LXG for short) is perhaps the most intriguing.  Based on a mini-series by eccentric but brilliant comic writer Alan Moore and artist Kevin O'Neill, the film is a collection of famous literary characters (mostly British) assembled to form a superhero team, sort of a gaslight era X-Men.  They consist of Alan Quartermain (Sean Connery), the Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Dracula's short-lived concubine Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), Dr. Henry Jekyll (Jason Flemying), Captain Nemo (Naseerudin Shah), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) and American Secret Service agent Thomas ""Tom"" Sawyer.  With a lineup like that, you expect LXG to be a rip-roaring action/adventure film, but what results is, while not terrible, somewhat pedestrian.The film is set at the turn of the century, the nineteenth century that is, and a supervillian operating under the nom-de-plume The Fantom is causing havok in the nations of Europe, attempting to pit the superpowers, primarily Britan and Germany against one another, in a bid to send them into a World War, so he can sell his new weapons of mass destruction (Tanks, armored suits and machine guns).  The British government has decided to recruit a somewhat reluctant Quartermain to lead the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to stop this from happening.The best thing going for LXG is it's interesting depiction of the characters as damaged and repentant individuals who have decided to use this opportunity to set right the rather tarnished state of each's reputation, as well as salve their scarred souls.  Most interesting is Dr. Jekyll, who struggles with his famous alter-ego, Mr. Hyde, in several effective sequences.  Quartermain and Nemo are also interestingly drawn as old men unhappy with the sins of the past and looking for one last gasp of glory.Visually the film is a impressive canvas, with cities depicted as sprawling collections of Victorian architecture gone wild, and Nemo's primary transport is especially stunning, complete with silver engraving, bringing Jules Verne's ahead of their time designs remarkably to life.  The visual effects are mostly flawless in their execution, and the effects of Mr. Hyde are a particular standout. Another sequence that is a knock-out is a visual depiction of a phonograph recording as the characters listen to it, filmed in a grainy, documentary style.However, where the film seems to fall is in it's general lack of excitement. While there are some decent set-pieces here and there, for the most part the film seems to be on verge of cutting loose and then scales back.  It also doesn't help that, thanks to the development of the Fantom having advanced modern weapons, the action scenes end up looking like most any other we have seen in recent films, with machine guns blazing and, most ridiculously, Captain Nemo's apparent pension for martial arts fighting (once again, the long shadow of The Matrix casts itself over modern action fare).  Also, the characters rarely seem to have anything much suited to their natures occur.  There is a sequence here and there, but it's mostly straightforward fisticuffs and gun fights, not much room for the heroes to stretch their legs.Most of the acting is first-rate, with the always dependable Connery taking up the lead.  Especially noteable is Townsend as Dorian Gray, who carries himself with a very casual, matter-of-fact air.In the end, LXG ends up not a disaster, but far below what one would expect from the potential of the material.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

OK, OK...this is some adaptation 'ala Blade', '300' etc of some pulp comic or something and we know even the best intentions might not always deliver, yadda yadda yadda... Well... I had just watched 'Walking with dinosaurs', the 100% CGI simulation/documentary about dinosaurs narrated by Kenneth Branagh, and -to my dismay- CGI compared favourably to this movie, with the -small- footnote that this movie (supposedly) is some A+ millionaire production of the year, while WWD is a modest production for the likes of discovery channel. I got a bad feeling when the Victorian building in Kenya explodes, and the explosion is a B A D CGI effect...a glitch I have rarely seen in WWD. Then you get this soup made of Batman-inspired CGI car chases in CGI sepia/Gothic gotham cities and CGI buildings rumbling that make the silliest PIXAR movie look just awesome. Mr.Hyde is another EXTREMELY POOR SPECIAL EFFECT and Nautilus is thin as a book, but apparently inside is as wide as the Taj Mahal...an inhabited by an artistic taliban rendition of captain Nemo that might very well have hard days in an airport these days. Kali-worshipping Nemo with a turban and acting like mr. Miyagi on crack?! Time cop with Van Damme had already brought defamiliarization in the form of modern gadgets in the past, and the angle here is overdone, like in some bad captain America cartoon when he debunks some Nazi conspiracy. The vampire woman reminds me more of Beowulf (with Christopher Lambert ) than Coppola's Dracula. There supposedly is a plot, but I was busy recovering from CGI-inflicted seizures that I somewhat missed it, but something like THE AVENGERS I suppose. Acting?! Well...

It had been better if a bigger part of the movie had taken place during daylight hours. The special effects are rather bad. It's easy too see that things are fake.

You could imagine Seans younger 007 growing older and becoming very similar to Allan Quatermain, the character he plays here. OK it may be slightly silly to see a 72 year old man getting into fist fights and generally running around like Connery did in films like From Russia With Love, but to me thats all part of the fun, and I would much prefer to see Sean do films like this than the likes of Finding Forrester or Rising Sun. Also the rest of the cast are great too, especially Peta Wilson who is absolutely stunning. Shane West does well as Tom Sawyer when you consider his character seems to be tacked on ( which it was ), he should have a t-shirt with Token American on it. Jason Fleming is OK too, although I thought his Hyde was way OTT. I must admit the only thing that put me off this film was that it reminded me slightly of Wild Wild West, a film I thought was very poor. Would love to see a sequel to this but it seems unlikely as it wasn't the huge success it could have been.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
138,extravaluejotter,Alan Moore's Extraordinary Decision,2,23 October 2006,"Alan Moore is a living legend in comic book circles. ""LXG"" is based on the DC comic book series that he and talented artist Kevin O'Neill created in 1999. Since being credited as the film's inspiration, Moore and O'Neill have now disowned it. What surprises me is that they put their names to it in the first place.Here's the pitch - ""Set in an alternative past where technology is more advanced, a group of popular fictional characters assemble to thwart the plans of an evil genius."" OK, when you describe it this way, the premise of the film sounds like it could be fun. Unfortunately it doesn't work out like that. The film is a fine example of a corporate marketing exercise gone badly wrong - with violence toned down to get a Parental Guidance rating and a superfluous American character grafted on to make it more attractive in the USA.One of the problems that the film has is a lack of focus. In one of the first big fight scenes (in Dorian Gray's home) the action has to swap between Allan Quatermain and Tom Sawyer's straightforward heroics, the hokey martial arts of Captain Nemo, Dorian Gray wandering around listlessly stabbing the bad guys and some Invisible Man hi-jinks. In later action sequences, matters are blurred even further by the beastly antics of Mr Hyde. Another problem are the ""provenances"" of the principal characters. Captain Nemo is presented literally as an Indian prince, despite Jules Verne's original having a more cosmopolitan look and attitude. The Invisible Man is presented as a thief who stole the ""formula"", as 20th Century Fox weren't able to secure film rights for the H G Wells original See-Through Scamp and inventor of the invisibility process, Hawley Griffin. Dorian Gray is presented as indestructible, his only weakness the painting that shows his true age and the injuries he has received. Oscar Wilde's original is ageless but there is no mention of Dorian's perfect likeness providing him with any protection from injury.Then we move on to the production design. In a word - woeful. Nemo's ""Auto-mo-beel"" looks like someone sprayed FAB1 (Lady Penelope's pink Rolls Royce from ""Thunderbirds"") white and grafted on some pointless curlicue ornamentation. The ""Nautilus"" is similarly dishonoured, reduced to a battleship hull with yet more pointless squiggles at bow and midsection and a set of daft-looking statuary at the stern. In stark contrast, the interior is remarkably ornamentation-free! Nemo's faux-Victorian vehicles do not compare well the startlingly modern WWI-era tank and fleets of Zeppelin airships, although this may be a deliberate attempt to differentiate between Nemo and the Fantom. The hand-held machine guns are clearly modern weapons in clunky metal boxes and the armoured uniforms of the Fantom's men look medieval compared to the khaki and field grey of the British and German soldiers. The film has no real sense of time or place, as if the production designers wandered through a series of museums and picked out what they thought would work piecemeal, almost scene-by-scene. The original comic book premise works because Kevin O'Neill's design (aided by Alan Moore's research) creates a seamless and cohesive alternative universe. In contrast, the film is all over the place. Drafting Tom Sawyer into the LXG should have worked, but the ""Surrogate Son"" sub-plot with Allan Quatermain is pretty ludicrous. It would have been far simpler to give Quatermain an American wife in his past and thereby introduce Allan Junior as an American hero in the mould of his adventuring father.I don't normally like to compare films to their comic-book counterparts, but ""LXG"" really doesn't do its source material justice. Moore and O'Neill's derivative-yet-still-imaginative ""Steam Punk"" pastiche is already regarded as a cult classic but the film is merely a derivative and miserable damp squib in comparison.Why lend your name and reputation to ""LXG"" and have it removed from the far superior ""V for Vendetta"", Mr Moore? To me it seems to be a Most Extraordinary Decision.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
139,Pavel-8,Yawn. Shrug.,4,5 April 2004,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is my least favorite sort of film to watch. It's definitely not good, but it's not bad enough to evoke the sadistic pleasure of active dislike. It's just there, leaving you feeling as though you just wasted two hours. Based on the British graphic novels, the basic plot is mildly intriguing. In a fictional Victorian Age, a league of literary heroes is gathered to combat a villain set on destroying the world. The concept is similar to ""X2: X-Men United,"" minus the mutant powers. I'd explain more, but that's about all there is to the minimal story. The league consists of Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), a British counterpart to Indiana Jones, as the leader of the crew. Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) finds a place providing martial arts and transportation. Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) is both scientist and vampire. Tony Curran shows up as the always useful Invisible Man. Stuart Townsend is the aristocratic and nearly invincible Dorian Gray. Tom Sawyer (a blond-locked Shane West) has honed his firearm skills, as an American secret agent. Jason Flemyng rounds out the multi-talented group as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Together they face off against a trite and mundane megalomaniac intent on wreaking havoc across the globe. None of the above perform that badly on their own, but they also don't come together to form a greater whole. Part of the problem is that no one keeps up with Connery. Not only does he dominate the screen with his usual presence, but his character is also the most developed, leaving the rest of the cast with the Sisyphean task of matching the veteran actor.
In this regard, ""LXG"" is reminiscent of ""X2."" With so many main characters to follow, getting into any one of them is difficult, as the screen time of each is too limited. Unlike ""X2,"" ""LXG"" lacks the elan that should be present in superhero movies. It didn't provide any enjoyable or likable characters worth rooting for or against, outside of perhaps Connery's all too Bond-like Quartermain. If the heroes and villains of a comic book movie aren't interesting, the movie has no hope, regardless of effects or action.
On those technical fronts, ""LXG"" was merely mediocre. Five years ago, the effects probably would have been amazing, but too much of it now seems borrowed. Mr. Hyde is a cheap imitation of the Hulk; the Nautilus is a cross between a typical movie submarine and pirate ship; and the destruction of a major city has been done in too many apocalyptic flicks to count. Except when the Invisible Man was involved, there was nothing novel about the numerous fight scenes either. Like the rest of the movie, they weren't atrocious, just redundant and yawn-inducing. Bottom Line: ""LXG"" is a forgettable movie that will leave you wondering why you bothered watching it.  3/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
140,Vampenguin,Criminally underrated superhero film,9,13 March 2006,"I guess I should say straight off that like many folks around here, I haven't read the comics. Maybe that explains why I enjoyed this more than most other folks. Everything about this movie comes together perfectly, so perfectly in fact that I consider it to be in the same league with superhero films such as X-Men or Spiderman. Though those films may be slightly better, this is just just as enjoyable. The actors bring these classic characters to vibrant life, I cant imagine any actor playing these parts better. I was rather annoyed with the Tom Sawyer character however, he seemed very out of place. I blame this on the studios ""needing"" an American character. Oh well, Shane West still did as well as he could. I find myself thinking about Quartermain's line about ""American style shooting"" every time I watch a modern action movie, it definitely rings true. The atmosphere of this film is much different than a typical superhero film, and I think that is one of the things that sets it apart. Overall, this is one of the best superhero films of all time, even if the weren't originally intended to be superheros.9/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
141,RickHarvey,Average at best,5,22 August 2010,"The main ingredients to a delightful and successful viewing of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen would be ; don't take it seriously, let your brain switch off and enjoy the creativity and imagination that has been put forward for this film. At best , the film is average but it never boring and moves along at a quick pace.With the story being put into place in the first 15 minutes , the film unfortunately races away to the final credits with no truly exciting moments. The film could of been much better but instead it shallow with no real great moments. But to comfort us through to the end is Sean Connery who as always gives a great performance . The most annoying factor of the film is the fact that i found the super humans hero's to be rather annoying and tedious . The one who was invisible, i just hoped he died early.Overall, it a average film which consists of almost zero great moments, even the action scenes, despite being pulled off decently, never really made you jump of your seat . The acting is decent enough but by the end off it, you'll most likely will ever watch it again",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

143,w00f,An adventure movie in the Indiana Jones tradition,8,16 July 2003,"Sean Connery finally did it... he got to be Indiana Jones!  The Indiana Jones movies are loosely based on the Alan Quartermain stories, and I can see why Connery took on Executive Producer as well as lead actor duties.  He cast himself well as the aging Quartermain on what should be his last adventure.There isn't a deeper story to this movie.  It's admittedly superficial. Then again, it's tremendously good fun, with plenty of well-staged fight scenes, good acting (there are no *great* performances here, though I especially liked Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Dorian Gray), strong special effects, and plenty of Alan Moore's imagination left intact.  It's pure, take-it-for-what-it-is entertainment that doesn't try to be profound, unlike the recent and horribly heavy-handed ""X2"" or the even more insipid and preachy ""Matrix 2: Reloaded.""All in all, just a good, old-fashioned, grab a bag of popcorn and catch an action flick kind of a movie.  I think it compares favorably to the Indiana Jones films, and will probably have a lot of appeal to people who enjoyed those movies.The ending, of course, leaves the door open to a sequel.  Doesn't everything these days?  In this case, I hope they don't make one.  I can only imagine what a botch would be made out of that!  Let this one stand on its own.

Like how they give Capt. Nemo a little background, when in the book he isn't like that. And what about the cowboy? That is also strange. But the film itself never stops entertaining me. Sean Connery may be old, but he's the greatest, he'll forever be remembered as James Bond to me. What also made it worthwhile is that they are portrayed as superheroes. Like an early Justice League, most of them are based great literary works from the early age of science fiction. Allan Quartermain, 20000 Leagues, Dracula, Huckleberry Finn, The Picture of Dorian Gray, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

146,Jexxon,"Well, Stephen Sommers probably likes it...",1,15 February 2005,"The story takes place in a slightly alternate reality where a bunch of literary icons are summoned to help to save the world from masked madman the Phantom.Based on a graphic novel, LXG never managed to get me excited. I could never really accept the premise of these characters getting together in the ""same universe"". They just feel too different from each other. Throwing in Tom Saywer and Dorian Gray in the mix just feels a bit desperate. Surely there must be other fictional characters that could have been better suited for the job as some kind of superhero? With such a plethora of different characters, it takes time to introduce everyone and present them to the audience. In fact, you could say that the first 45 minutes or so are nothing but character presentation. The plot is not much more than a device to get the characters together on film. Take for example the destruction of Venice. In another film, this would probably have been a climax of sorts - here, it has no real function at all, except that it allows for some action sequences.The script would have been better if it just had stuck to the concept of some heroes fighting a bad guy who wants to destroy the world or something. Instead, there are some unnecessary ""twists"" and red herrings that really don't go anywhere. There are also quite a number of plot holes that makes it hard to enjoy the film: everything that happens in Venice, Hyde going soft all of a sudden, and the evil genius' master plan...It's also fairly obvious that the script and budget didn't match. All too often the effects look shoddy. It's not horribly bad, but they should have kept things small (like X-Men) instead of going over the top (like Van Helsing).The acting is OK (Townsend's Dorian Gray actually worked best), but the script doesn't seem to allow for much character development, which is a shame considering that there are some potentially interesting characters here. The first 10 minutes are surprisingly good, but after that things just go downhill. It's not the biggest disaster I've seen, but it's simply too sloppy and boring too be any fun.

147,davidemartin,One helluva good flick,10,12 July 2003,"Spoiler Alert After megabombs like Charlies Angels: Full Throttle, it was refreshing to see a huge budget movie that actually delivered the goods.  Every penny shows up on screen, whether in the script, the production, or the formidable talent in front on of or behind the camera.What's more, this is a movie you want to see with friends so you can talk about it afterwards. It's that detailed and it is that good.The plot really does leave you guessing.  And this is not the ""where the hell did THAT come from?"" questions that plague flicks like the aforementioned CA:FT but rather the ""okay how did they figure that out?"" The mystery aspect of the film does play fair by the rules; everything that is revealed has clues laid out beforehand.  Like the mysterious ""M"" who assembles the League.  My buddy Henry guessed right, while I figured Moore was using the more mysterious Mycroft Holmes.Okay, Moore did rearrange characters a bit in order to make them fit his chronicle.  Tom Sawyer should be in his late 50s.  But on the other hand, a little-printed third Tom Sawyer novel, TOM AND HUCK AMONG THE INDIANS, did give Tom the background to be the character seen in this film.  Mina's condition is simply an exaggeration or a progression of her status in Stoker's book, where she had begun to exhibit vampiric skills (like a mental link to Dracula).  Dorian's invulnerability was an interesting interpolation of the conditions laid forth in the book.  I had expected Mina to jam the painting onto the same sword hilt that pinned Dorian to the wall and thus kill him but now that I think of it, the camera angles wouldn't have worked. And as to someone complaining about him as a hero, wach the movie again. His cooperation is forced by extortion although I suspect boredom plays a small part as well.About the only quibble I have with the film can be summed up by five words---- Deep Rivers.  REALLY DEEP Rivers! When the Nautilus is quietly cruising the Venetian canals, the guy next to me asked ""What if they have to make a right turn?""  And when the villain escaped in the pod, I had to stop laughing at an imaginary exchange: ""Captain Nemo, the Nautiloid has turned down a side canal.""  ""Oh crap, that's it.  We're screwed.

148,MetalGeek,Fun Popcorn Flick,5,11 April 2011,"I've never read Alan Moore's ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" comic book series, but it seems that familiarity with it is not necessarily a requirement for watching this film, as I'm told that it differs greatly from the graphic novel. This movie was hammered pretty mercilessly by critics and audiences when it was released in 2003, but I found it to be a rather offbeat, mostly fun action/adventure romp.The film takes place in an alternate-reality Europe of 1899, and features a number of characters from 19th/early 20th century adventure stories banding together to battle a mysterious supervillain called 'The Fantom' (he's sort of a steampunk Darth Vader) who plans to ignite a world war using previously-unseen technology that he's developed in his top-secret lair. Sean Connery (in his final live-action film role to date) toplines as H. Rider Haggard's Allan Quatermain, who is called out of retirement in Africa by Her Majesty's Government to join the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - a collection of heroes with ""singular abilities"" who are gathered together whenever the world's in peril - and neutralize the threat. The other League members include Captain Nemo, Mina Harker (from Bram Stoker's ""Dracula""), ""an"" Invisible Man (not THE Invisible Man of H.G. Wells fame, mind you -- apparently due to copyright concerns, this guy's a thief who stole the invisibility formula from Wells' character), the eternally youthful Dorian Grey, the tortured Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and a grown up Tom Sawyer (!) who's now a ""special agent"" for the U.S. Government. This motley crew boards Nemo's trusty submarine, the Nautilus, and travels across the world to foil The Fantom's evil plot.The main thing that the film has going for it (aside from the always-welcome Connery) is its lush, atmospheric look. Obviously no expense was spared in terms of costumes and set design, and the special effects (though heavily reliant on CGI) are done well enough. As the League pursues the Fantom and battles his henchmen in various world capitols, there's certainly enough action that the viewer won't get bored. I was particularly impressed with certain key scenes involving Mr. Hyde and the Invisible Man, and the rock'em sock'em final battle at The Fantom's hidden weapons factory deep in the mountains of Asia will satisfy action junkies who've been waiting for lotsa stuff to blow up. Connery proves he's still the world's most bad-ass senior citizen as the two-fisted Quatermain, and Shane West supplies fine supporting work as Tom Sawyer.In the end, it's probably a good thing that I never read the ""League"" graphic novel because then I probably would've spent the entire run time picking apart the differences from the source material. Alan Moore, of course, has disavowed the film version (as he does every time Hollywood adapts one of his works) and Connery himself has said he ""didn't understand"" the film, but hey, as far as escapist, Saturday afternoon popcorn movies go, you could certainly do worse than ""The League."" Fans of other underrated, period-piece adventure films like ""The Phantom,"" ""The Shadow"" and ""The Rocketeer"" should have a blast with it, and perhaps viewers may become curious about the featured characters and head to their local library to discover some classic literature. This is the kind of movie that's got ""cult film"" written all over it and hopefully more people will discover it as the years go by.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

150,clydestuff,A film that deserved a better fate,8,14 January 2004,"Many times film have such bad vibes during production that they are rumored to be a terrible mess before they have a chance to premiere.  Some films that suffered this fate during filming were The Godfather and Titanic.  Both turned out to be box office bonanzas and the trouble they had making it to the big screen was quickly forgotten. Then there are films like Valley of the Dolls and Myra Breckinridge which were legendary for their on the set squabbles and dissension among cast members.  The end product of both of those productions were films that should have won awards for being the ultimate in cinema stinkers.  In 2003, we are given The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which had already become legendary for it's problems between director Stephen Norrington and lead actor Sean Connery. Add to that such disasters as a flood wiping out production in Prague and you have a nation full of critics ready to pounce.  And film critics being what they are in not wanting to waste an opportunity, pounce they did making it one of the worst reviewed films in the past year.  Add to that the fact that Fox made the mistake of pitting it against Pirates of the Caribbean in it's opening weekend and it you have the makings of a box office disaster. Did League deserve it?  No, it's a film that in my opinion is fun, highly watchable, and deserved none of the over the top blasting it took from some critics.  Maybe if it had come out after Gigli many would have looked more kindly on it.League has an extraordinary premise for a fantasy/adventure film. The idea of using legendary figures from literary fiction to combat a madman The Fantom who is out to destroy the world is much more original than the sequel based films such as Tomb Raider and Terminator 3 that we were subjected to this summer.  (League is based on a comic book series that I have not read, nor if I had would not use as a comparison.)  Our team of intrepid super heroes consists of Alan Quartermain (Sean Connery), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), a now vampiress Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), The Invisible Man (Tony Curran), Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), Tom Sawyer (Shane West) and Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (Jason Flyming).  The cast does an excellent job of bringing each character to life.  Connery has been highly criticized for his portrayal of Quartermain, but for those who cannot appreciate his presence I suggest you try watching Richard Chamberlain in the same role in his two films.  That'll teach you.  Peta Wilson gives Mina Harker a strong seductive personality that reeks of sexual tension.  Stuart Townsend manages to make Dorian Gray the most watchable of the characters by surrounding the character in an aura filled with flair and Mystery.  Jason Flyming brings a new characterization of a tormented Dr. Jekyll, who as Mr. Hyde is transformed into a creature Bruce Banner would be proud of.  Shane West exudes a boyish charm as Tom Sawyer befitting his character.  Though seldom seen except in covering makeup, Tony Curran manages to give the Invisible Man an unmistakable personality.  If there was a flaw in the casting I would have to say it was Shah as Captain Nemo.  His characterization is for the most part one note and empty, devoid of personality.The story moves along at a nice even pace.  It quickly introduces the characters so that we are able to get to know their personalities, then moves ahead with the action. Writer James Robinson and director Norrington make equal use of each of the characters abilities so that none of their talents are wasted.  The production design, set decoration and art direction are all top notch, giving us a dark and brooding turn of the century look we haven't seen before.  There are the usual minor plot holes and flaws one could find if they took the time to study this film, but films like this weren't made for film class.  For that you watch Citizen Kane.  Films like League are made for an audience to have a good time while loading up on the popcorn and soda and nothing more.  And I did have a good time.  After the critical blasting League took in the press I steered clear of it for quite a while.  Fortunately, several months later, I gave it a chance and am certainly glad I did.  I suggest you do the same.My Grade B",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

But enough jokingI had high hopes for this movie, but while I did like it, it fell far short of my hopes. Rather than rehash the story, I will just hit the highlights.The Action was great, but the problem is it rarely stays on a shot long enough for you to see anything - especially with Nemo. What glimpses you see are terrific, but it's not enough to really enjoy or appreciate it.Also, I felt like they put all their character development into one basket. It felt like a giant pause in the movie when you begin to learn about the characters. I wish there was some action inserts to keep things feel like they were moving.While many feel the need to criticize certain unbelievable elements in the movie, I must comment ""It's a fantasy! That's the point!"". Who cares whether Nemo's sub should fit in the canal's of Venice. This isn't necessarily our world, remember?In spite of my criticism, I did enjoy the movie a lot. There was a lot of good action and plot twists in the story.

The story was weak and most of the characters were dispensable.  Notable exceptions include immortal Dorian Gray for his interesting backstory and Peta Wilson's female vampire, Mina Harker, for being, well, Peta Wilson.  ;)The worst offender was Shane West's grown-up Tom Sawyer.  What exactly is he doing in this movie??  Every time he showed up, I found myself getting angrier and more annoyed with this movie.  Sean Connery's Allan Quartermain grew quite boring after a while, and it became apparent that his character wasn't needed at all.  The filmmakers just needed a famous face to try and carry the film.

155,wchngliu,"In Spite of Its Flop At The Box Office, This Is Still An Enjoyable Action Romp",7,23 October 2007,"So many people have criticised this film, but whilst it has its flaws, it is nevertheless a good little action flick with impressive special effects and great action sequences thrown in. Sean Connery is known to many of us as the definitive James Bond 007, but since his success as his namesake character his follow-up efforts have been a mixed fortune altogether. That aside, kudos to Connery though for being the only Bond actor to make a successful transition onto Hollywood films, and thus sustaining a film career that spans five decades.In a nutshell, one could sum up 'The League...' as a history/literature lesson laced and fused with superhero and comic book themes and ideas. Alongside Allan Quarterman, his band of merry men and a woman consist of Captain Nemo- a martial arts expert, a young and eager adventurer, Tom Sawyer in ER's Shane West, the Vampire-esquire Mina Harker, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Invisible Man and Stuart Townsend's slightly flamboyant yet 'campy' Dorian Grey.Many of these characters are unknown to many people, particularly myself seeing as so many of us are unfamiliar with the original comics, but this alone didn't prevent me from being engrossed in the film and take an interest in what was going on in the film. If anything, one needn't to have been familiar with the comics, just as long as he/she familiarises themselves with the good verses evil theme, which runs through all action films of this type.A lot of the negativity that this film took was rather unfair I have to say, but as I mentioned before, this is one of those films you either like or loathe. There will be issues as ever with adaptations, and questions regarding its attempt to recreate its original premise and how faithful and unique it is to the comics themselves. Ideally, just put all that aside and enjoy it for what it is, which is as a fun, action-packed romp. The fight sequences are good and the special effects aren't too bad either. Definitely not the best comic book movie made, but if you are a fan of superhero movies, and you are after something slightly bizarre and different all at the same time, from the X-men films, for instance- then give this a try.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Specifically James Robinson, the screenwriter, Dan Laustsen, the director of photography and Stephen Norrington, the director. Toss in the producer, the art director and the editor, just for a good measure.It's incredible how an interesting idea, with all the colorful characters from the most popular 19th century novels, can get developed so poorly and be given such a shabby storyline. The villain the League is pitted against is way below their special skills and traits. That's why they're given very little to do other than bicker among themselves. The way their dialog and exposition is written is frivolous, offhand, tedious and inane, trying to be both goofy and smart. It made me cringe every now and then. The screenplay obviously never made it beyond the first draft and they probably patched it on the set as well.It's even more incredible how bleak and muddled the picture looks. When I think of Victorian era, I think of splendor and vivid colors. The fact that the story is set in a war time and that many of the characters emerge from horror novels doesn't mean that the picture has to be ruined to convey the atmosphere! Here it's mostly gray/black, with occasional yellow overtones during the scenes in Africa, and with one of the worst orange-and-teal filters I've ever seen, when they are at the sea.Even if the picture was alright, the shots have been poorly framed. The camera, for one, is simply too close or too zoomed-in most of the time. Overall experience watching this was claustrophobic. The director couldn't make use of the sets to save his life. Furthermore he hasn't got a good grasp on how to direct action in an epic blockbuster. We're talking about the guy who directed ""Blade"". What he did in ""Blade"" doesn't work here because this is not hi-tech sci-fi flick and the backgrounds are not dark. Too many cuts and illogical camera angles during fights add to confusion and put a strain on the eyes in this setting. It was especially jarring in contrast with the rest of the film when nothing happened and they just walked from place to place and exchanged silly conversations.For those who wonder how an interesting premise could bomb so colossally at the box office, look no further than these basic aspects. There is no elaborate reason here. I'm sure the general public wouldn't mind a nice Victorian fantasy. Maybe not everybody knows who Dorian Gray or Captain Nemo are, for instance, but everybody likes epic adventures. ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was not a victim of a missed concept or public ignorance. It failed because the basic laws of making a watchable film were ignored.Obviously, it was clear to people in charge in Hollywood, because none of the people I named earlier found any meaningful work ever since. And, if rumours are true, ""The League"" does have a future, and maybe the next film crew does it justice.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The heros rush off to various places, various good guys turn out to be bad guys and vice versa, you don't really care enough to wonder why. Absolutely implausible things happen.

The British are not portrayed as fools and there is no disdain for 19th century Britain.Lots of good scenes and those looking for realism are in the wrong genre. This is more comic book type action.  Reminds me of the old films  like Journey to the Center of the earth or the Hammer films.  This is not aimed at teenage computor nerds who are from sheltered suburbs looking for arrogant jokes and gore.  This film requires imagination and being able to lose yourself in the film. Connery is refreshing and fine as the lead and better than Harrison Ford in my book.  I am going to see it again.  The Mr. Hyde take is more like the hulk than the Hulk.  No heavy gore or graphic love scenes so all ages can go. Great to see some fictional famous characters thrown in and this was fun, noble and well worth it.  Imagination is here.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
162,jckruize,Dumb and loud.,4,23 February 2005,"Leaden adventure fantasy features a bulky, badly-toupeed, unconvincingly intrepid Sean Connery leading a cast of young unknowns pretending to be heroes from 19th century literature.Okay, I didn't read the comic books, but I've always had a high regard for writer Alan Moore ever since WATCHMEN. So I admit this is an intriguing concept, teaming Allan Quatermain (Connery) with An Invisible Man (apparently they couldn't clear the rights to Wells' 'The'), Dorian Gray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker from ""Dracula,"" and even Tom Sawyer (whom I understand is not in the comic books but was added to appeal to American audiences). Lots of possibilities here. There's even a villain from Arthur Conan Doyle, Moriarty (but alas not his nemesis).Unfortunately this film wallows in overblown action sequences in lieu of plot and an overuse of CGI that runs the gamut from good to shoddy. Production design by Carol Spier (frequent collaborator with David Cronenberg) is occasionally endearing but too often rendered ludicrous by sheer extravagant scale -- wait till you lay eyes on Nemo's gargantuan submarine Nautilus. Also, for a story set in 1899, anachronisms abound: automatic weapons, ballistic missiles, a car that could compete at Indy, etc.'Based on a comic book' is often a a handicap to overcome, at least in the perception of those in the audience who are not fans. What the filmmakers have done here is cater to the 'kid factor'; you know, the way a 10-year-old boy would think it was COOOOL if, for example, when Dr. Jekyll drinks his potion, he doesn't just become an evil, lust-filled alter ego; no, he turns into the INCREDIBLE HULK! And Mina Harker can morph into a ferocious BAT-MONSTER at will! And the bad guy looks like DOCTOR DOOM! And Nemo kicks butt like JACKIE CHAN! And fruity Dorian Gray is invulnerable to bullets and swords kinda like SUPERMAN! And did you know that you can drive a submarine the size of the nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz beneath the streets of Venice, Italy?

Lots of noise and explosions, hardly serves to entertain, and then easily forget.For those who know the particular canon stories of these mythical characters, it is sad to see the treatment given to them in this film, just plain sad (if you are a fan of some of this characters you may even get angry), and even more sad that this is Sean Connery last movie before retirement, because he deserved much better than this.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

167,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,7,12 July 2003,"Theatrical adaptations of famous comic books are becoming the new trend these days in Hollywood. The major studios are digging out every comic book superhero imaginable even the lesser known ones and so far the films have been successful. So it isn't surprising that 20th Century is stepping up to the plate for the third time this year. Daredevil was a moderate success garnering $100 million against a $75 million budget and X2: X-Men United kicked off the summer season with a bang gathering $210 million against a $100 million budget. Fox is hoping that The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen will be just as successful but it will be a hard sell. The League is a much lesser known comic book mini-series then big profiles superheroes like Spider-Man or X-Men, so there won't be as big of a fan base to rely on. Another problem for the film is the down trend the comic book adaptations are looking to take. Though The Hulk set a new opening weekend for the month of June, the film dropped seventy percent from its opening weekend and was poorly received by both critics and the public. Rumors of fights breaking out between Sean Connery and director Stephen Norrington helped generate bad buzz for the film. The lackluster trailer and television ads have not been helping stop the bad press going against the film. But can The League fight against the odds and rule the box office or will the gentlemen be less then extraordinary?The story centers on the formation of a team of extraordinary individuals that must fight an evil man who has plans for the world. During the year 1899, an evil individual by the name of The Fanthom has gone around the world capturing scientists and causes major catastrophes in order to have the European countries blame each other. This, he hopes, will cause the countries to create a world war and with his advanced military weapons, the European countries will have to buy from him creating a huge profit for himself. The British Empire, determined to avert a world war, calls upon a man named `M' to assemble The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Allan Quartermain, the hero of such tales as King Solomon's Mines, is chosen to lead the team. Other members of the team include Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Mina Harker (Vampire), Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll, and Dorian Grey, each of which holds a special ability unique to the team. Joining along for the ride is Agent Sawyer (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) from the United States. Each individual seems to have a hidden secret and don't get along with each other but they must put their scrabbles aside in order to save the world from the brink of war. The story for The League starts off well enough but slows down in the middle before picking up once again in the end. The dialogue is pretty serious for the most par but most of it seems too comical at times, which hurts the overall effect. Backgrounds on several characters are missing which would have been helpful to connect better with certain individuals but with most being famous literary characters, the film makers probably figure the audience knows who they are already.The cast that makes of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a mixed bag at best. Sean Connery, who takes the role of Allan Quartermain, is great as usually as he seems to really to get into the role. Despite rumors of fights between Norrington and himself, Connery does a fabulous job with the character showing that Quartermain is beginning to show his age but desire to go out fighting. Connery can still kick butt like his young co-stars as his fight scenes show. Tony Curran, who plays the role of The Invisible Man, does as best of a job as he can but this character has its share of problems. The Invisible Man seems to be nothing more then a comedic special effects diversion and seems to just plain disappear for a good portion of the movie with little explanation or care. Jason Flemying does his best with the role of Dr. Jekyll, which is pretty good for the most part, but his character is also a special effect diversion when he becomes Mr. Hyde. Shane West is great as Agent Sawyer, though the film could have done a better job explaining how this care free boy from Mississippi came to be in the secret service but that is a minor squabble. Peta Wilson, from La Femme Nikita fame, does a pretty good job as Mina Harker but there really isn't much presented to the character. What is the deal with her and Dorian Grey? That is never really explained and causes confusion for the audience. Speaking of Dorian, Stuart Townsend is moderate as the character though most of the problems with him involve the background of the character rather then the acting.Overall, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a good film but is really more for fans of the comic book mini-series or those who seriously know their literary figures. Too much background information on many of the characters is missing for most of the main stream to truly understand on where these characters are coming from what and what is going on based on their actions. The specials effects for the films, which seem to be focused on in several scenes in the film, are moderate at best. If you want superior special effects then go see Pirates of the Caribbean or even The Hulk, though with The Hulk you have to endure a very slow story. In that case, just stick with Pirates. The CGI work, especially with the Nautilus is some of the worst that has been seen this summer. The timing for the film seems perfect though the story itself slows down in the middle. The action sequences keeps the audience entertained and that should be sufficient enough for at least one showing. If you really want a film that can be seen numerous times then pick Pirates over The League. But if you just want to see something different for one night then stick with The League. It may not be fantastic but it is worth the price of admission. For a matinee at least.My Rating: ***1/2 out of 5 (Grade: B-)",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

170,tenten76,19th Century X-Men.. Brilliant comic-book superhero film.,9,18 August 2003,"Two things stand out in my mind - the fantastic characters, and superb (non-stop) special effects.Most importantly, this superhero film does everything right: you open with the villain, naturally an enigmatic, scarred mystery man - and he gets the ball rolling.  Then you get the recruitment (always vitally important for superhero films), giving each character a chance to show off a bit of their powers/talents.  Every one gets a chance to shine - as you'd expect - and there isn't really a weak one, in personality or powers - which is very good.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie, but I'll keep trying.After the recruitment, they're off to Venice (or rather Prague), by which time you've seen one of the coolest cars AND the coolest submarine in celluloid history (both of which feature quite a bit).  Stunning effects in this whole sequence, which leads us to.. ..the 'reveal'.  There's a bit of man/boy bonding with Quartermain and Sawyer, but it's not too long-winded.  Overcoming the problem, they then head for the villain's lair.  I'd like to think I guessed who the villain was (certainly the name had crossed my mind), but I'll admit I didn't put 2+2 together until just before we find out.Villain's lair: the heroes split up for different objectives, which always encourages their specialist talents.  I don't want to say too much, other than it (the whole ending) lives up to the previous 70-80 minutes.  Not a real cliff-hanger, but it would certainly lead into a sequel if need be (perhaps even with a couple of new recruits!)Character-wise, Sean Connery is Sean Connery - superb, craggy, dry, capable of some cool moves.  Dorian Gray - my favourite, acting as you might if you were immortal.  Mina Harker - gorgeous, and a sexy strain of vampirism. Invisible man - didn't think I'd like him, when I thought he might just be a cockney comedy turn (and he does get most of the jokey bits), but it's not too bad.  Jeckyll/Hyde - really well done/great concept, especially in the final sequence.  Nemo - comes across as a bit of a ""Q"" figure, all technology and manpower, until you see him fighting and then you think ""wow"".  Tom Sawyer - okay.  Not nearly as annoying as he might have been, but I understand his character was added purely for the father/son dynamic with Sean, with casting likely to have been influenced by some 'teenage girl' aspect.  He doesn't have any special talent (even though this could have been made fundamental to his usefulness, it's not), and although he does manage to shine in a few scenes (plus some funny flirting), I just think he wasn't that necessary.That said, everything in the film screams quality and careful plotting, and nothing is overdone, neither in the production itself nor in the inevitable romance/comedy aspects - all of which work well.I'm not really criticising though.  I love this movie (Did I say that already?  Have you taken that in yet?), and would watch it again right now if I could.  If I could have changed anything, I would have made it longer - not because it needed it, but because I would have liked to see even more.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

So you can understand that my expectations were high when the film came out.My initial impressions when I first saw this were fanboy appreciation. However, 8 years onwards, I catch myself thinking: ""What the heck were you thinking?""Let's start with casting. The perfect: Connery as Quartermain (though the original drug addicted Quartermain would have made the film more interesting), and Shah as Nemo. The rest of the cast is plain forgettable.As for the story, I initially was a proponent for completely following the graphic novel word for word, until I saw Watchmen, and was disappointed. However, that being said, I wanted something more challenging in the script, especially if you are going to turn a complex graphic novel to the screen. Instead, the story is dull and straightforward. There were many counts of spelling out of inferences in this film, insulting the viewer. As for the action, in hindsight, it was really ""Americanized"" with all the wild gadgets and explosions--plain boring. Basically, if you saw ""Van Helsing"", you've seen the action.My recommendation? One watch is OK. It does get trite. But for all those Alan Moore fanboys, dump it, and just appreciate his graphic novels. It will be hard to bring any Alan Moore movie successfully to screen.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

176,henri sauvage,"""The vampire lady has us covered""",4,20 July 2003,"Whatever you think about this movie, this line -- delivered by Sean Connery as Allan Quatermain -- is the saddest indication possible of the decline in this man's career. Though Connery is mostly known as the best of the Bonds, he also has a substantial and well-deserved reputation as a dramatic actor.Watching his performance in this movie, especially the way he delivers lines like the aforementioned, you can see he's lost his enthusiasm.The film itself is not utterly awful, just not all that good. It makes a big deal of its use of literary characters, but doesn't try to remain true to the original authors' conceptions. It promises some interesting interplay between all these tortured souls, but mostly fails to deliver.What it does serve up is plenty of over-the-top action sequences with enough gunfire and explosions to satisfy even Billy Sol Hurok and Big Jim McBob. The steampunk look of the film is generally well-conceived, although there's an almost Gilliam-esque weirdness to the scene where the Nautilus -- in this version, a super-sub roughly the size of the Titanic -- glides through the 17-foot-deep canals of Venice.

179,Welshfilmfan,An Enjoyable film with a troubled Production,8,1 February 2009,"Although 'LXG' doesn't reach it's full potential, it's still a better than average Hollywood Film and a nice piece of escapism - It's loosely based on a comic book series of the same name, It's set in an alternate turn of the 20th Century, where several characters are brought together, Allan Quatermain played by Sean Connery who leads the cast along with Tom Sawyer (Shane West), Captain Nemo (Nasseeruddin Shah), Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran) Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde (Jason Flemyng) & Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend)- they are all brought together by the even more mysterious 'M' (Richard Roxburgh) who wants to bring together a talented group of individuals known as 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' who aid the World in times of need, in this case to combat the threat of the 'Fantom' who is the mastermind behind a latest threat to World peace.'LXG' is an lavish, enjoyable actioner, The set design is magnificent and the script for the most part is very good - Where the problems begin is that Connery had major disputes with the Director Stephen Norrington to such a degree that he vowed never to make another film, Norrington disliked the Studio Interference. The character of Tom Sawyer played by Shane West was NOT originally in the script, the character was added because The studio demanded an American in the Movie and give it some appeal to young audiences, Then the Studio put pressure on the Producers to finish quickly and then the Special FX didn't go to plan and although 'LXG' Had a pretty large budget of $78M, a stonking $17M of that went to Connery, leaving him the only 'big' star the producers could afford and to finish the disasters off the terrible floods in Europe during filming ruined $7M worth of sets. Norrington has vowed NEVER to Direct another film after this troubled production.Taking all that into consideration it's remarkable 'LXG' made it to the big screen at all, and for what it is, it's a really fun thrill ride, but it was a disappointment at the Box Office taking $66.4 at the U.S B.O & $179M Worldwide and it was critically panned (overly harsh in my opinion) with a mere 16% fresh rating Ah well, I enjoyed it and so will You! **** out of *****",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
180,UnderworldRocks,"Good, but not great...",1,24 December 2013,"Good, but not great, and certainly not extraordinary.The film has a mashup of characters such as Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Hollow Man, Vampire Mina Harker, a twisted-but-very-much-unfaithful-to-the-original-novel version of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Dorian Grayinevitably, each character feels a little underdeveloped (unless they make this film 4 hours long), but is redeemed by the wonderful cast including Richard Roxburgh, Sean Connery, Stuart Townsend, Tony Curran It is because of their decent acting that this film avoided the fate of being a piece of plain, cheap, worthless, immediately forgettable Hollywood junk that depends solely on special effects.The sets of the film are well done. Using these sets, the story will do much better, if transformed into a VIDEO GAME where players can experience role-playing each of the characters, become godly shooters like Allan, turn into bats like a vampire, play the Hulk-like Hyde, control the nearly invincible handsome figure of Stuart Townsend that wears a charmingly malignant Lestat's smile like he does in the epic Queen of the Damned, travel across the ocean, from London to Paris, from Venice to Snowy landscapes, come across various challenges The idea of a video game is definitely worth a try. However, not gonna happenPS:I believe the role of vampire Mina Harker could be better if played by Kate Beckinsale.

181,HBeachBabe,"Not Gigli bad, but...",4,15 August 2003,"I so wanted to like this film.  The graphic novel was brilliant.  I am perfectly aware that changes are needed whenever adapted written stories to the screen.  The flaws aren't because the movie didn't follow the book exactly - the concept alone could carry a film.After all the horrible critical reviews I decided to pass until i started seeing positive reviews from 'average movie goers' and I began to wonder if this is just one of those action movies like Armageddon that critics just don't get but people love in spite of it's badness.  So I went.Where do I apply for a refund of my 2 hours?What went wrong?  ""everything"" is too broad.  A few things are OK.  The effects work was good.  Well what could be seen of it.  The editor (taking a bad cue from Michael Bay) cut this film together like a hyperactive 5 year old in desperate need of Ritalin.  It was impossible to follow the action in the action scenes.  Often, this is done to cover up poor direction as I suspect was the case here.SPOILERS AHEADwhy was the Venice scene there?  It served no plot function and winds up being completely pointless.  It is destruction for destruction's sake.  It doesn't even further the villain's goal of causing a world war.  Also, why was Connery even recruited then?  He wasn't going to make any contribution to the villains 'superman' gene pool and becomes only a liability, so why go out of his way to bring him along at all?For that matter, why the whole charade of the League?  M was trusted and could have easily obtained all he needed without the ruse of the Phantom.In short, the entire reason for the story was stupid.  Rather than be an evil mastermind, the villain is revealed to be a moron with Rube Goldberg pretensions.  Why use a steak knife  to cut your steak when you can use a 120 bladed Swiss army knife, right?I won't repeat the continuity blunders like Quatermain's, Jeckyll's and most notably Gray's magically self repairing suits or the absurdity of a ship the size of the Titanic traveling through the canals of Venice - ""There's the Villain!  He went left... oops, we're screwed"" or a naked man surviving for more than 5 minutes in Siberian snow or 3rd degree burns healing without a scar in presumably a few days (the time between a character's death and the funeral).

Every plot turn is more moronic then the last and every special effect is more sloppily done. They must have ran out of a budget after the first 15 minutes.For anyone to think this plot concept could work as anything besides so bad it's good, is rather amusing in of itself.Only see to have a nice little chuckle at all the wrong spots.Oh, and a very, very 'there's going to be a part 2!' ending to cap it all off.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
183,simon-trek,"""An entertaining spectacular!""",6,19 February 2004,"I really thought this was both incredible and interesting. What is really great about this film is the way a group of classic characters from 19th century literature are brought together to become a league of one and save the world. I thought Sean Connery was great in his role as Allan Quatermain who could also be called ""The Indiana Jones of the 19th century"". I thought the invisible man was a great character and had a great Scottish accent. I really liked the way he put white make up on his face instead of wrapping up his head in bandages, so you could actually see his face. But you can never see his eyes so you can never quite tell what he's thinking. I liked the way Captain Nemo was played by an Indian actor rather than an English actor. The reason why he was played by an Indian actor in this movie is because Jules Verne wrote a sequel to '20'000 Leagues Under The Sea' called 'The Mysterious Island' in which Captain Nemo revealed that he was once ""Prince Dakkar"" of India, who was forced into exile when he lost a war with another country and his enemies murdered his entire family. Then he used his riches to built the Nautalis not only to avenge his family's murder but to fight against any nation which enslaved another. As for the Nautalis in this film, it was the most beautiful version of the Nautalis I had ever seen! It was enormous and graceful looking both on the outside and on the inside. To me it was more like a luxury liner than a submarine. I also liked Mina Murray Harker. It was interesting to me that a vampire was using her powers for good rather than evil. I also liked the way she could transform into a flock of bats and attack a large group of men. Dorian Grey was also interesting to me because in this film he was capable of something that Oscar Wilde didn't think of: being able to heal rapidly when shot or stabbed. Tom Sayer was a great American spy and gunman. It was great to me how he was able to have sharpshooting lessons from the great Alan Quatermain.I absolutely recommend this film and I hope it will make these classic 19th century characters even more popular.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
184,johcafra,Tom Sawyer Can't Grow Up,5,15 July 2008,"I'd not heard of, and have yet to read, the graphic novels on which League is based. Yet there are two points that make me enjoy a repeat viewing of this otherwise ponderous flick.First, believe it or not, the acting. Among the huge cast I first recognized only Sean Connery, and barely recognized David Hemmings. But given what is handed to them all the players give their very best. Connery himself is the model of worldly-wise and world-weary restraint, and entirely within character. (If, as reported, he swore off movies because of League, give him his due regardless.)Richard Roxburgh's ham-in-a-masque reminds of an observation concerning the British stage actor Sir Donald Wolfit that The Bard did not write a part Sir Donald could not sing. Jason Flemyng must wear a tonne of prosthetic makeup but still acts through it. You really do start to believe in the ""freaky little darlings,"" and I like to see more of their players.The second point is a bit subtle and likely the real reason the flick falls on its effects-laden face Stateside. True, you are led to believe literary characters come to life. You presumably are introduced as well to Ishmael from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, and are not introduced to H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man (no pun intended).But look and listen real close, draw upon your recollections as a reader, and you should realize each portrayal is WRONG. I'd like to think that a purposive literary conceit, perhaps to underscore the alternate-world tone and tenor, and if so I note that with appreciation for at least the studied effort.With one exception. The Tom Sawyer I know acquires wisdom beyond his years in the hands of Mark Twain, who is for my money America's greatest writer. But seeing Tom a ""special agent"" on assignment for the U.S. Government and a fairly crack shot at that positively wounds. Huck Finn, on the other hand",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
185,pmcollectorboy,Utter garbage,1,20 September 2004,"Man I have never seen a movie more utterly boring and haphazard than this movie. League of Extraordinary Gentleman pilfers many great literary works to give us flat, uninteresting characters that are merely products of their own misinterpreted clichés from the literary versions(i.e. Doctor Jeckyl is no longer a tormented man but a hulking brute who is a slave to his ""drink""). The plot is shallow and riddled with clichés(how many times are we going to get the cliché of somebody accused of being a traitor but it's really somebody else?). The character Nemo, who was a great, complex man in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, is reduced to a laughable character in this film. That was the last straw. If you want to see a retro ""fantasy with technology"" movie, see the infinitely better Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
186,rorymacveigh,I'd rather hoped Sean Connery would retire with a bang rather than a bomb!,2,15 August 2012,"This film truly is a mess, a Grade A, 110% mess, filled with inconsistent characters, useless effects and a story that I still cannot fathom, but the sad part is the first 10 minutes of the film actually gripped me because they seemed rather down to earth.The story begins in 1900 London where Metropolitan Police Officers are confronted by a German Tank which breaks into the Bank of England. The crew gets out and begins to execute the Soldiers and Policemen and steal the gold. One Policeman is left alive to tell the British Government what happened. Meanwhile in Germany, a group of British Soldiers invade a Zeppelin Shed and a mysterious masked man with what appears to be a heavily deformed face behind, destroys the Zeppelins by way of a Harpoon. The chances of war between England and Germany begin to rise dramatically as peace relations between the two countries break down, with both blaming each other for the tragic events.Meanwhile in an African Plantation, as a British Agent approaches the acclaimed adventurer Allan Quartermain, played by Sean Connery. The Agent begs him to return to London to help resolve the ensuing matter, but he is reluctant at first. Suddenly, a group of armour plated German Soldiers break into the building and start killing those inside. After a quick skirmish, Allan kills them all and agrees to return to London. Upon his arrival in London, Allan is met by a British Minister who says that he will be working with the help of a 'Special group of people', where upon he stumbles onto, and I'm really not kidding here, an Invisible man. And the rest I don't care to mention because that one impossible character ruined the rest of the film for me.If there is one way to go from impressive to implausible, this film certainly got it right. As far as I could tell, the rest was filled with story book characters who had not a single shred of faith to their original characters. There's Dorian Grey (who is invincible and ageless due to the presence of his painting), Captain Nemo (who has an impossible boat and looks like something out of the Thief of Baghdad even though James Mason's portrayal was far more exact), Mina Harker (as a Vampire, oh for Christ's sake), Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde (Mr Hyde looking something like a Tank from the Left 4 Dead games rather than the more human looking hunchback that he was in the original story), Tom Sawyer (an American Agent who seems to be the only other Human Available at this point) and do I even have to mention the Invisible Man?Really, this film had so much expectation, so much exactness, so much of a chance to make a film that could have been a good story, stayed within the realms of reality and been historically accurate (minus a few tweaks here and there), but they decided to go and throw it all away so they could have a bunch of storybook characters running around London with Sean Connery. You'd think that after the last miserable film he was in with an Invisible Man he would have thrown the script out of the window and gone to play Gandalf in Lord of the Rings...",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
187,diztorted,An extraordinary film for out of the ordinary people,9,17 July 2003,"Well, as I saw this film last weekend I realized something... Guys theses days don´t know who Dorian Gray was, for them he was just a girly stupid foe, not to say that they had no idea who Alan Quartermain was nor Mina Harker. The awful truth is that almost no one reads these days, well at least not beyond Maxim´s hottest girls of the year.This film based (although not completely) on the graphic novel (a nice way to call a more sophisticated form of comic) by Alan Moore and Kevin O Neal is great. Is a delicious visual and information feast for those who have read and like the works by H G Wells, Bram Stoker, Jules Verne and Lois Stevenson...not even in my wildest dream I had ever thought to see such wonderful characters united, a league that would make Dr. Xavier sweat. Of course, if you have the culture to know what all these Victorian winks mean.Sthephen ""blade"" Norrington, brings us this fantastic extrvanganza, for the likes of some and the hatred of others, but as I say, if the people who come here trashing this film are the same who came out loving Xmen2...then why bother listening to them.Well the first Blade was a major success but in the end it became just a cult classic, this one has the same fate...by the time it gets to DVD it will become one of the most expensive cult movies of the year. But I would like to think that the people who buy it, are the intelligent cult people who can recognize something good when it is in front of them.Now, not all of it is joy and roses, there are certain changes that did not help either the plot nor the development of characters...I´m aware that if Norrington would have stick up to the original comic plot, he wold have ended up with a R rating, so they lowered down some things, added up some action and even included characters and situations not seen in the book. The book is far more compelling than the movie, but still it works as a summer fun extravaganza. That said, enjoy, read a little, and you might understand each of the characters.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

190,nvillesanti,Steampunk at its Best,8,22 June 2009,"I really enjoyed ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" It different and original, but it also has that old school cliffhanger action of the 40s and 50s. I read many reviews that slam this film saying that it lacks of historical accuracy. Please, I didn't know that Dracula and Dr. Jekyll were historical figures. People fail to acknowledge that this is a fantasy/adventure film that combines fictional characters from the 1800 in a unique way. The story is adventurous and brings back characters like Allan Quatermain, (played by Sean Connery) from King Solomon's Mines novel, Mina Harker (Played by Peta Wilson) from Bram Stoker's horror novel Dracula, Tom Sawyer (Played by Shane West) from Mark Twain novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and so on. They are all brought together to form a sort of X-Men like heroes, but set in 1899, to fight an evil villain by the name of M. The plot is quite intriguing, although uncomplicated; it gives the viewer an alternate story of long forgotten characters.The movie has elaborate set design, beautiful photography, and great action sequence. The acting is not over the top and costumes are very Gothic. I have never read the graphic novel, but after watching TLOEG, I definitely will check it out. But what I liked the most was that I could actually watch this film with my kids and not have to worry of any inappropriate language, excessive violence or nudity. Unfortunately, not many people like the Gothic heroes and it looks like this movie has become one of many. Who know? Perhaps it will find new audience in the future.

It's as monotonous and non-compelling can be. Sad but true. It's not worth the roughly two hours unless you have it as background noise while tackling something else.

192,captnemo,Don't listen to the negative talk. Go see this!,7,11 July 2003,"(Spoilers)While there are some continuity problems, and some of the action is a bit over the top, ""League"" is still a terrific film. Less ""taken"" from the Alan Moore comic, it's more or less inspired by it. The IMDB cast list has Roxbourgh listed as Mycroft Holmes, but he's really someone else from the Holmes Canon. Perhaps this is to not give away something. The characterizations are an improvement over those in the book, with Mina and The Invisible Man taking top honors. As a Captain Nemo fan since the age of 6, I cannot complain about him or his ship in the movie. I did prefer them in the book, but they are different here, and serve the film well. Nemo kicks butt here as never before, and that's a big plus. What can I say? This is a terrific summer film, just as good or better than anything else out there. It's set up for another film and frankly I can't wait. Another feather in Sean Connery's cap for this one. The look on his face when M identifies himself at the beginning is priceless.Rating: 7 out of 10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
193,obiwan2005,I love films like this.,9,15 July 2003,"For some reason, this movie reminded me of Alec Baldwin's 'The Shadow'. I think there should be more movies about contemporary comic book characters. 'The League' isn't very true to it's source material. It adds characters and shifts roles as well as takes the plot in a different direction. The filmmakers' thought by instead of adapting the comic book, they'd take the concept of a crime fighting group consisting of classic literary characters into a direction all their own. And I liked that. Sean Connery is always wonderful, and is Alan Quartermain, famous explorer that discovered King Soloman's Mines. He is the main character here for obvious reasons. In the book it was Mina Harker played here with a delightful mysteriousness by Peta Wilson. Additions include Shane West as Agent Tom Sawyer from the U.S.A. I liked his character alot, especially his relationship with Quartermain. Stuart Townsend as Dorian Gray, the immortal. I grew to like this character as well. But for reasons I can't explain without spoiling the picture. The film was good. Action on par and the excitement was tense. The wonder of this film is Dr.Jekell and Mr.Hyde played by Jason Flemying. The way Mr.Hyde was huge and brutish (like the Hulk) but still had a human face that talked intelligently made me gasp 'How did they do that!?!' And keep in mind, I NEVER do that. I'm a big film buff and have grown immune to special effect because of the knowledge I have of how they work and are executed. But that effect baffled me. While the story sags in the middle and the finale is a bit cliched, the movie is still enjoyable. Great summer movie fare.RATING: *** out of ****",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

195,CMUltra,Disappointing in content and style.,5,12 July 2003,"This was one of my most anticipated movies.  I love Connery and the premise of this was great.  A Indiana Jones setting for adventure, six great characters from classic fiction, and a good story.Somehow, these elements were lost in the presentation.  The story is supposedly based on a graphic novel (comic book) by Alan Moore but the departures from the original story are too numerous.  Sadly, not only the storyline is abandoned but the style and flair is as well.The entire movie is far too dark.  I'm so tired of ""dark and atmospheric"" becoming just a vehicle for covering up lousy sets and fx.  The action sequences are fake and choppy as the director decides on fast editing rather than skilled choreography.This is a period piece, set in 1899 but there are a lot of continuity errors.  They refer to the car as a ""car"", for example, though they didn't know what it was.For his part, Connery does fine.  But he really always does.  Connery doesn't really ""act"", he's simply himself each time.  Thus you won't see much difference between James Bond and Allan Quatermain.  You will see a huge difference, however, in the quality of the Connery Bond movies and LXE.The other characters were fun at times, but they either ended up underused, poorly portrayed or just odd.Wilson's Harker character was very confusing.  Was she a vampire?  If so, what of the old mythos about not being out in sunlight?  She walks around on the deck of the Nautilus in broad daylight.  Not sure where all the bats came from either, particularly in the Arctic.I liked Dr. Jekyll best, I suppose.  However, his character left a lot to be desired as well.  He comments early after Mr. Hyde saves the Nautilus not to make a ""saint out of a sinner"", yet the movie does just that.  Hyde is never portrayed as vicious or evil.  He's either running frightened of Connery's gun or eagerly lending his hand to the good guys.  Uhhh...Tom Sawyer as an American Secret Service agent.  Nah, didn't really work. Dorian Gray was a waste as well.  A deep character that they didn't bother exploring at all.  Nemo was terribly underused.In better hands this would have been a much better movie.  It had a lot of things going for it in casting, plot and premise... but they made it stale and flat.  Too bad.5 out of 10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Even though the movie takes quite a few liberties with the characters, if it gets people interested in reading the originals, cool!I don't mind the anachronisms and implausibilities -- a 22-foot car, in that era? Venice streets drivable by same? a palatial submarine? Venetian canals navigable by same? and so on. After all, the works these characters came from reveled in their anachronistic and/or implausible elements. That was supposed to be part of the fun.I'm just hoping that nobody naively assumes the movie versions of these characters were good matches for their literary originals.

198,johnnysugar,Dreck In The Victorian Age,3,22 July 2003,"""From Hell"" was the first film adaptation of the fantastic comics of Alan Moore.  Dark and brooding, it was a stylish and shadowy take on the tale of Jake the Ripper with a star performance by Johnny Depp.  Things boded well for an adaptation of ""League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" one of Moore's more well-known works.  But again, it seems, Hollywood just doesn't get it.The premise of the film is intriguing.  In 1899, a team of heroes taken from Victorian-Age literature are assembled to stop a madman from sparking a war between European nations.  The team includes hunter Allen Quartermain (Sean Connery), American CIA Agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West), the vampiric Mina Harker (Peta Wilson), the immortal Dorian Grey (Stuart Townsend), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde (Jason Flemyng), and the assistant to the Invisible Man, who's stolen his mentor's formula (Tony Curran).  What could have been a fantasticly fresh take on the superhero genre is wasted in a sea of explosions and a stunning disregard for both the source material and the laws of physics.Beginning with the characters themselves, the film makes its first mistake. The addition of a gun-toting Tom Sawyer and a preening, glam-rock-star Dorian Gray to the team (they do not appear in the comic) was unwise. West has no screen presence and I was tired of Townsend's ambiguously bisexual antics halfway through ""Queen Of The Damned,"" where he played pretty much the same character.  Besides this, the producers saw fit to make Mina a vampire (in the comics, she is merely a survivor of supernatural horror) and weren't even able to procure rights for the original Invisible Man.  Not a good sign.  As it is, I take mild offense to Tom Sawyer's addition, as it seems the producers assumer Americans (the main audience for the film) would be clueless as to the other literary characters were.The film itself tries far too hard to be a contender in the summer blockbuster season.  Stephen Norrington may have directed comic book adaptations before (""Blade""), but ""LXG"" is not ""X-Men"", nor should it try to be.  The action is too confusing, the characters only as deep as their unique abilities, and the plot advanced only by the next waste of special effects money.  Had the film been a subtler, dark film (and bold enough to warrant an ""R"" rating instead of pandering to adolescent boys with a ""PG-13""), it would have been much more effective.The performances themselves are entirely hit-and-miss.  With a huge amount of money spent on Connery, there was little left to go around, and fairly unknown (read: cheap) actors filled out the cast.  Peta Wilson does evoke a nice sense of tortured menace in Mina (although you can suspect that the original choice for the role, Monica Bellucci, would have been much more effective).  Richard Roxburgh does what he can as M, the man who assembles the team.  Connery, however, walks through his role, letting his distinctive growl and the fact that he IS Sean Connery do all the work.As for physics and the real world, they don't exist.  Nemo's warship-sized Nautilus sails easily through the canals of Venice, the city itself being depicted as if the producers created it from scratch and didn't think anyone would notice.  While the manipulation of physics and science is common in adventure films, few make such glaring real world mistakes.
Had this film been made as an almost-satire, ala ""Charlie's Angels"", all of these mistakes could be forgivable, and the film would've been fantastic. As it is, the film takes itself far too seriously and, like ""The Hulk"", degenerates into a long, boring, and insufferably dense entry into a summer movie season already heavy with failures and missteps.  3 out of 10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Even the earliest manifestation of that production company dates from 1916, not 1899...As far as the entire ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" goes as a movie... Hmmmmmmm.

Only a handful of famous characters from 19th century literature, that's who. The forming of the league was by far the best part of the movie with the recruitment of Dr. Jekyll really standing out. Then, the league is finally created, the action starts, and the movie falls flat on its face.The action scenes ranged in quality from average to poor and the plot didn't make much sense. I'm still not sure why Moriarty wanted Quartermain in the league. Is he looking to create an army of worldly adventurers? Also, I couldn't understand Tom Sawyer's role. He stood out like a sore thumb. You could tell he didn't belong and he stole the focus away from the other characters. Before Sawyer appeared, Quartermain was an interesting character. After Sawyer appeared, Quartermain was basically Tom's mentor, and little else.The early scenes are great, and the movie is almost worth seeing for the novelty of seeing 19th century superheroes, but if it's good superhero action you want, go see X-Men 2 instead.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
203,kidwltm,"Far From Great, But Could've Been Worse",6,11 July 2003,"""LXG"", as the producers so hipply marketed it as, does at least the basic job of a summer popcorn film; Help people kill time in as least boring or painful way possible.  It provides your basic barrage of huge action pieces, loads of f/x, and a screenplay overflowing with catchphrases.  Alan Moore's concept helps the film break away a little from other popcorn films, in premise at least, not in structure.  It's fun to see all the heroes of yesteryears come to life on the big screen, thans largely to a talented cast including Jason Flemying and Stuart Townsend.  The only real blemish on the cast is Shane West, whose cornball red neck accent is enough to shame any american.  The film tried to inject some emotion into the characters, and it works on a small level, but doesn't achieve a connection to the audience as say that of the ""X-Men"" films.  The dialogue was also mediocre in most places, but some scenes were so poorly written it's borderline ""Batman and Robin"".  Thankfully it never gets that bad.  One thing the film sorely lacked was a strong villain.  The Fantom is pretty much a coward, and when he does fight it's against the 65 year old Connery.  Not very threatening.Norrington definitely got lazy in this film.  Rare is a shot in the film that doesn't feature some kind of digital effect or enhancement.  This can be used to create a great texture for a movie, if used in proper increments, but it's just a complete saturation here.  It's pretty to look at sometimes, but they could have gone old fashioned and achieved a greater result. But, for the most part, the F/X is good.  It's obvious the f/x crew spent a lot of time on Mr. Hyde, as the result was a very believable monster.  Some f/x were spotty, especially those involving water.The action was really a mix and match for me.  Norrington subscribes to the new, frantic editing style of action films, with shakey camera and poor lighting to added on.  It can become rather annoying at moments, but still will satisfy your action jones.so, the screenplay needed work. The action was solid, the cast was rather good, and though the Norrington's style can cause a headache at times, it at least makes the film visually interesting.

204,Adrian Sweeney,Great fun and a treat for the eye,8,30 April 2008,"You know, this film is bloody good fun actually. God knows why I'm bothering to review it as it's been on telly and everyone's seen it already, but I saw the unfairly low rating and had to chip in to correct the balance.Yes, they changed a lot from the comics and inserted new characters. But I was always baffled and disappointed that Alan Moore didn't do with Mina Harker what the filmmakers quite sensibly do with her here. And Dorian Gray is an excellent addition to the mix (and I gather was originally to be in the comic anyway). Tom Sawyer is a fairly gratuitous and pointless addition (and a quite offensive one to Americans, I reckon, the implication being that they as an audience would be unable to identify with a line-up of foreign heroes), but he doesn't grate much after a while, mainly being there to have a quite touching relationship with Connery's Quartermain and provide a subtext about America inheriting Britain's imperial mantle.And there are sequences that seemed aimed exclusively at 13-year-old video-gamers, and action film clichés I've come to loathe - must there always be a traitor within the gates? - although usually handled here with such aplomb they seem natural and logical. But put all that aside. The design, sets, costumes, special effects and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. So too some of the action sequences - some of Nemo's sword moves in particular are a joy to behold. The acting and casting, down to relatively minor roles, is uniformly excellent.This is an enchanting fantasy, wonderful to look on and great diversion for two hours or so. Particularly for fans of the steampunk genre. Why does everything always look so much better as Victoriana than its modern equivalent would?",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
205,illegal_alien51,"Extraordinary Gentlemen... perhaps, but...!",2,15 December 2003,"*Possible tiny spoilers*I saw the trailer in the cinema and went ""WOW!! This is definitely a movie to look out for!!!""Yep...... I wouldn't say that again! Basically what the movie consisted of was the 2 minute trailer copied together about 45-50 times, at least it felt like that - The movie in whole had just as much more to give as the trailer did. The best scene was when Quatermain entered the movie, and his introduction. From there it was going downhill like a 100 wagon runaway train, going down Mount Everest straight into the depths of the Japanese sea!!I must admit, I've not read any comics on this topic, but I'm talking about the film anyway!The film introduced one new character after the other for a while, then developed into a very convenient mega-plot without any big mystery or turns to it.I was NOT impressed by what all the characters represented, whom they were and all that! Also was it very ridiculous to have Tom Sawyer to be working for the US government! I would say, from judging the original book(s) he would have rather been fit to play an arch-anarchist!It was very annoying that whenever there was danger the group came up with some (mostly rather unconvincing and) too convenient way of beating whatever was going on. The award for ""most ridiculous scene for many years"" went to the Venice scene. The timing was wrong and it was just not logically possible what they did....  I guess it's a fantasy movie so it's not supposed to be logical...  or is it? I think it still would have had the responsibility to entangle me with some logic, where ever it might have come from. That fantastic characters were used does not give the movie makers the right to just invent any convenience to beat whatever ridiculous threat! The story of this movie was as flat as melted butter in the sun... The constant action scenes disrupted any kind of story building that would have been able to make this movie better. There was hardly a possibility to connect to the characters and the initial personality boost of Quatermain was destroyed early on.It was predictable: I did actually bet that Sawyer would have to use the rifle at the end of the movie - because of this tragic scene on the submarine where he had to practice shooting! Well, I won, whatever I won. Also... was it said that Quatermain would not die in Africa? Well, practically he didn't and once you're dead you're dead normally... but I guess that topic is open for discussion. I would recommend to put some heavy boulders on Quatermains grave so he can't get up for the sequel!I'm sorry to say that though... because Connery is the only reason why I'm giving this movie 2 out of 10. I hope he had a good time making this movie, that he earned his money but also hope he will never look back.Had the movie been one hour longer and would it really have made you connect with the characters I would have easily been able to enjoy it more myself!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
206,jwhale9382,I loved it! What more can I say?,8,26 August 2003,"I saw this movie with my mom and my best friend. My mom said she couldn't understand how there was enough road in Venice to drive on, or how Tom Sawyer survived the car crash. She also thought Hyde was a cheesy imitation of the Hulk. But my friend and I loved it. I admit the plot was a little predictable, but the action was intense and the League members worked well together: Quartermain leading the team and acting as a father to Sawyer; Harker putting her brain to good use; Jekyll and Hyde providing back-up muscle; Nemo providing their mode of transportation; and Skinner providing comic relief. My favorite part was when we find out who the Phantom really is, what his scheme really is, and about his spy. It's hard to believe that one man could be so powerful and still work in secret. So maybe it didn't have a deep, complicated plot. If you love movies with lots of action and a bit of humor, than this movie is for you. Rent it! See it!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
207,nolanjwerner,Why?,1,11 January 2004,"Why do you buy the rights to a good comic book and make such a terrible movie out of it?They took eveything that made the comic book good and forgot all of it. Here is my short list (There may be MINOR SPOILERS):They added two characters, one completely extraneous and removed basically anything even remotely literary. On top of that they gave the film basically no exposition so unless you were intimately familiar with the characters to begin with you would basically be lost. They redesigned ALL of the vehicles, ignoring Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's meticulous designs, instead creating a phallic cruise ship Nautilus and the ""Nemomobile,"" one of the stupidest vehicles ever. They changed the characters so much that even if you knew who they were going in to the film, you would probably be lost, Alan Quatermain/Quartermain (since he does not even know how to spell his name) is the leader and no longer an opium addict, he is brought together to be part ofSPOILER WARNING---One of the stupidest villian plots ever since of course the good guys are easier to destroy when they are together then they would be if they were separate.The Invisible Man is no longer the interesting Hawley Griffin, the sociopath who murders policemen with bricks and walks around in their clothes ut a ""gentleman thief"" named Rodney Skinner. Now they had a legal battle with the estate of H. G. Wells over that so I can not entirely fault them on this character and he was occasionally interesting. And of course since no American knows about anything subtle, they have to say Mina Murray is a vampire while in the REAL version they only hinted at it.And that is not even mentioning the plot lacunae.It is a rare film where more time can be spent pointing out what was wrong with the film then its actual running time, this is one of those.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

In a moment, I was entranced.This film is one of such that to see it once is a passing fancy, but to see it more times is a thrill ride. The story is crisp and well written, the music is set to the hilt of the story, the designs for characters and devices is well done, and it matches the Victorian era style to which it adheres to ever so nicely.The story is set upon one old hunter who, having long since retired, is called into action along with others, each having a special ability, so it seems, and the group is pitted against a madman set on starting a global catastrophe. While the plot may seem simple, it is actually very lively and well acted out.

And Dr. Jekyll with Mr. Hyde was pretty cool, accept for the fact that he was a good guy in the film.The special effects were amazing in this film, to me it looked very, very real and unique. Because when i go to the theater to see a film, the movie has to be a pretty big deal and at the end of the film, it has to be worth it, or else it stops me from seeing other films and then they are very good.

212,jack_malvern,Dismal,1,27 October 2006,"How can one sum up the pervasive awfulness of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Perhaps it is best to quote some lines from a scene in which the crime-fighting league is reeling from an ambush by the villainous ""M"". A despondent Dr Jekyll suggests that they are finished. ""No,"" responds Tom Sawyer, a rifle-wielding Victorian CIA agent. ""We're alive. If M has any idea to the contrary, that gives us an edge."" Captain Nemo, the bearded owner of a vast and unconvincing solar-powered submarine (I jest not) is unconvinced. ""The sea is vast, he could be anywhere,"" he says. A good point, but Sawyer is unabashed. ""Yeah, well, I'm an optimist, now maybe that's a crime to you twisted so-and-sos but it keeps me from going crazy... Because we'll get out, man... at least, I will. That other agent I told you about was my childhood friend. We were agents together until the Phantom shot him dead. Now you can be done, but I am not. I will avenge his death."" Illuminating exposition as this is, Dr Jekyll is more interested in a piece of East vs West philosophising. ""It's not about any one of us, Tom, it's bigger than that."" Sawyer: ""Yes, it is, Jekyll! The fate for the world is in our hands... the world! So M tricked you. He brought you all together and you walked straight into his trap. But the way that I see it, that's the part he did wrong... He brought you together."" Jekyll: ""He has a point.""James Robinson's back-of-a-napkin script is as bad as anything ever written, but it finds its equal in the quality of the acting and directing. Sean Connery is probably the most charismatic of the bunch, but he delivers one of the blandest performances of his career. His bewigged African adventurer, Allan Quartermain, mainly resembles a fumbling geriatric who looks like he needs a stick to help him walk - until there is a fight scene, at which point he is replaced by a breathtakingly obvious stuntman.The prize for worst performance is a toss-up between Tony Curran, the cheeky-cockney Invisible Man (who would be better cast as the Inaudible Man, in my opinion), Peta Wilson, a vampire who can't see a giant blood spot on her face despite staring at herself in a compact mirror, Jason Flemyng, who is outacted by his make-up, and Shane West, a character supposedly based on the Huckleberry Finn character Tom Sawyer but who shares no characteristics whatsoever.The story, in which a clutch of heroes are banded together to overcome a megalomaniac's deadly plot, is fairly standard stuff. What really nails the film to the ocean floor is the reliance on very, very bad computer-generated imagery (CGI). Why, when the solar-powered submarine appears, does all the water flowing off it disappear half way down the side? Why does no one standing next to it get wet? Why, when Mr Hyde is running across the rooftops of Paris (where he has fled to avoid British authorities and in no way merely to give the characters somewhere new to go), does he not obey Newton's third law?But the worst aspect of the film is that it is a travesty of its source material. It has taken Alan Moore's much-loved and subversive graphic novel and turned it into a bit of froth on a par with Van Helsing. Stephen Norrington, who I see from IMDb has gone back to his job as a make-up artist, should hang his head in shame.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
213,michaeldouglas1,Robert Louis Stevenson Spinning in Grave!,1,17 August 2013,"This movie is so terrible, there's simply not enough space to pan every wretched aspect. This movie was supposed to be a ""blockbuster""? I'm happy to report that it was actually a box-office ""A-bomb""! Okay, I suppose I can see some ""value"" in bringing together a bunch of literary characters who have nothing to do with each other, considering the IQ of today's average audience. Purists of the literary arts might cringe, but in today's ""let's make a quick buck"" off the old, tried-and-true, it's not surprising. But if you're going to take such artistic ""license"" then at least make it worth-while, with a quality script that pays some attention to the original characters themselves. Don't just steal their names and turn them into Saturday-morning cartoon fodder. While it would take too much time and space to go thru the sins committed against each character, suffice to say that their treatment of Mr. Hyde really sums the whole mess up. We not only get the most horrible, laughable CGI I've ever seen, but just what the heck were these ""movie makers"" thinking of, in making Mr. Hyde into an redheaded Incredible Hunk? Can anyone imagine Frederic March or Spencer Tracy being turned into this silly, cartoonish caricature?

214,jeffpk,Sean Connery is so good....,7,3 November 2007,"... he even shines when he doesn't know what he's doing.From an interview I heard with him shortly before the movie was released: ""They offered me The Lord of the Rings, and I turned it down because I didn't understand it. They offered me The Matrix, and I turned it down because I didn't understand it.I don't understand THIS film, but I'll be DAMNED if I'm doing that again!"" Unfortunately of the three films mentioned, this is by far the weakest script. Still, it is not nearly bad as the worst films Connery has been in (Highlander II, anyone?). Even with bad material, Connery always puts in a fine and interesting performance and this is not awful material, its just not great either.Those who are Alan Moore fans will find a lot to love in this movie. It has the typical Alan Moore very imaginative re-imagining of classic characters. (I think the other reviewer who commented on character ""errors"" probably doesn't have Alan Moore experience.) And it has a classic Alan Moore plot twist to end it.All in all, a bit dumb, a bit too predictable in spots, but still much fun as a B movie.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
215,jimmylee-1,Extraordinary Mundane,5,26 September 2006,"Love the idea of comic books coming to the big screen. And loved the original concept of the league of combining literary characters into heroes. Didn't hate this movie, but sure didn't like it.It started out with such great potential. We see Sean Connery at what I assume to be the Explorers Club in Africa, and he makes so many delightful throwaway comments first when declining to come to the aid of queen and country, then while he disposes of the enemy in his casual English (OK, Scottish) way. The enemy, as usual, has its guns set on ""miss Quartermain, hit others."" Charming. I'm ready to enjoy what is looking like a nice solid adventure flick.But there's a foreshadowing of problems to come. With the building being large enough to hold an army division, but the bar itself (which one presumes, in that heat, would be the most important room) only the size of a third of that, what on earth was in the rest of the building? Dorm rooms? OK, I'll overlook that background issue, because so far the movie has been quite entertaining, thanks to Sean's character. We go to London, where the invisible man shtick is a little annoying, especially since his make-up constantly changes (normally, I don't catch continuity issues, but this is ridiculous) - perhaps this will end soon. Then Tom Sawyer shows up. Don't need him, don't like him, find Shane West to be (sorry) a less than able actor here. Find him completely distracting from the story, since he was a boy in the Mark Twain stories and suddenly he's a ""romantic"" young man. I left him back whitewashing Aunt Polly's fence, so his character just doesn't work for me, always trotting about saying something in a lame way. They would have been better off if they used Shane West's namesake.We see the submarine, and encounter some serious perspective issues there. Were we thinking it needed to be the size of Manhatten? How many rooms? Was it crewed by millions, or was it as narrow as a #2 pencil? Good grief. Then Venice. Talk about dark, convoluted, and pointless. Is M going to blame some other country to bring the world closer to war? (Sorry, but once I latch on to the plot, I expect the movie to follow it with me.) OK, yes, after everyone ran through Venice like a bunch of chickens/bats with their heads cut off, Venice still exists, but I saw a lot of buildings fall down, so I'd say it's a tie between M and the league whether one succeeded over the other. Except there is a cornucopia of delight for some special effects team. It's just an endless pile of boulders and buildings flying for me as I wait (forever) for the story to pick up and move on. And while I'm on the subject of the story: I realize that reading the LEG comics is not a pastime, it's a commitment, but the movie plot is just impractical. I could handle that M is really the bad guy (well documented from prior experience in comics), and that Dorian is on the wrong side (urbanity often leads you astray). But M isn't interesting enough as a character for me to really care about that whole blood collecting thing - I found him rather dull as villains go. (Except to wonder where his beard/hair went since only the mask was lying around on tables. Again: continuity!)Then we're off to the frozen wasteland. As before, the scenery and backdrops are excellent - clearly no expense is spared. And the Arctic wear that just pops out of nowhere (apparently a full costume staff is available on board the enormous nautilus - starting to appreciate the extra rooms) are lovely. But now we're just going slap-happy with criminal minions (are armies of bad guys who look alike available at every corner? Is that who was using the extra Nautilus space?) and battles that seem to take place in every room (""miss main characters, hit bad guys and disposable nautilus crew""). Sean is great (I think if he was reading cook books aloud, I would be happy); Stuart Townsend and Peta Wilson are good, but much of the cast seem to be just flopping about like pale fish on land. Maybe the make-up makes it hard to breathe? I realize it's hard to find actors willing to put up with a lot of make-up and special effects, but I had higher hopes that a movie with Connery would be more palatable.Speaking of the special effects, it's starting to be a treat to see real people fight like real people. I understand that Mina had special skills, and I'm fine with that. But I don't think Dorian Grey's clothing regenerated like his painting - after all, he does have to change his underwear (who does his cleaning?). And all that rifle stuff - was every character aiming to miss, or were we as competent at shooting rifles as we were at shooting the movie?I would have been OK with this if the producers were trying to get started with a series, and work the kinks out. But killing off Quartermain, played by the only actor with any serious abilities, was the death knell. The concept for this movie had a lot of potential, but it just wasn't carried out.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Those are the bad things, but this movie for me is timeless. It offers a sense of ""Blade"" like action without all the gore. It's a traveling adventure movie, which I absolutely love. Great characters and a great job for the casting of this movie, all of the characters fit well in this story.

I think at least the first half is pretty entertaining in case one has the discipline to NOT think for a second about the brilliant graphic novel it is (loosley) adapted from. The only original thing that the producers of this rather messed-up adventure kept in the script are the names of the characters (but not the characters of the characters, if you know what i mean). It shows that wanting to do please everybody with a story invented by someone like Moore is a very wrong move. Like i said i don't know anybody who really liked this movie. Sean Connery is annoying as Quatermain (i heard he stopped acting, it was about time), he seems to misunderstand his character totally and gets rid of all the strangeness Moore managed to give it.

221,rorymacveigh-66661,A film with potential... ruined!,2,29 March 2015,"If I was going to go by the first 15 minutes of this film, I'd say it was the foundations of a gripping and exciting period action film. Those introductory moments of this movie had me gripped, only to be botched by the biggest letdown I've ever seen. It's not often I don't watch a movie the whole way through, but this really did go from something great, to something so stupid it just falls into a league of its own! I realise this is based on a comic series of the same premise, but even in those boundaries this movie is rubbish!How does this amazing story start? In 1899, what resembles a British World War I tank breaks into the Bank of England and steals millions of Pounds of gold, the crime apparently being enacted by men dressed in German army uniforms. This is later compounded by a similar attack on a German Zeppelin factory, where British soldiers and a masked figure in a dark cloak destroy a large amount of equipment and kidnap a group of scientists. This results in the recruitment of Allan Quatermain, who is enjoying retirement in Kenya, right up until the moment heavily armed men burst in and try to kill him. Fending them off, he returns to London, whereupon he is confronted by an invisible man......and it's all downhill from there.The rest of the movie is just a chase across the world using ridiculous CGI technology and in the company of idiotically bad representations of icons of folk law and literature, including Dorian Grey, Captain Nemo (and a super-powered Submarine thing), chemist Mina Harker (who doubles as a bloodthirsty Vampire), Tom Sawyer (a US Secret Service Agent) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (who apparently doubles as a weedy nerd and the Incredible Hulk!).Now that I know that these are character depictions of a comic series, I understand why this has been done, but for those who don't (like myself going into this movie), you'd think this was conceived through some kind of fever dream. Sean Connery flies off to the ends of the Earth to pursue a masked baddie, joined by a bunch of misrepresentations about as subtle as a train accident in Piccadilly Circus!For what I saw, Sean Connery was once again the most captivating actor in the whole thing, keeping me glued to every line he said. As for the rest, the problem is they act far too 90's, not in the way people would act in the late-Victorian era. Indeed this is a bit of a personal peeve but it's quite a jarring one as you don't exactly find yourself being immersed. Although the names of Dorian Grey, Dr. Jekyll and so forth are household names from literature, you really don't know much about them at all, it's based entirely on name recognition and that's pretty much it! So many questions, not enough answers, and I found myself being left completely uninterested from the 15 minute mark onwards.Overall, give this one a miss. It's not a film to watch if you don't know the comic, in fact it's not a film to watch even if you do. In general it is a very, very poor display, a sadly humiliating note to end Sean Connery's career on.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The movie drops even a step lower, because it does very little with the interesting concept of literary characters joining into a team; the movie ignores most of what makes these characters unique, and diminishes them into generic action movie heroes.Visually, the film had its moments, but many of the effects seemed sub-par. The DVD extras informed me that what I thought were unconvincing CGI effects destroying Venice were in fact unconvincing model work.

I know everyone has their opinion and that just fine but reading some reviews it seems that people are just taking this movie WAY too seriously.  The movie doesn't take itself seriously so why should the public.  IT'S FANTASY PEOPLE!!!!  You know; not real.  It's not supposed to be the uplifting, heart warming, life affirming movie of the year.  It's just supposed to be fun and that is exactly what it is.With the always excellent acting of Sean Conery as well an excellent supporting cast, this movie is very fun and WELL WORTH going to see at full price.  On a scale of 1 to 10 it gets a 10.  It has tons of action and VERY well done fight scenes.  And of course the special effects are excellent. The story IS great and moves along at a perfect pace.  At just shy of 2 hours, it seems to fly by and doesn't drag at all.  I was even a little sad that it was over and I wanted to turn around and see it again.  Yes it's over the top but that falls under they category or DUHHH!!!!  After all, it is based on a comic book.  They always are over the top.  That's the point.Anyway, if you go into this movie expecting something that will change your life (like many silly critics and other people seem to have done) then you will be VERY disappointed.  But, if you go into it expecting a fun, over the top, movie to get away from everyday life, then you should be very pleased. This movie is just plain fun no matter which way you slice it.

The dialogs were also very interesting, and increased in my opinion the quality of this movie...This movie deserves an 8. and i actually had fun watching it.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

229,paperback_wizard,"So, what?",4,17 July 2007,"I don't care if it was a complete departure from the graphic novels, or if it had anything to do with them at all. As for historical flubs, I could care less if Rasputin or the Axis of Evil itself were mentioned. As for characters that I've never heard of, throw in the most obscure literary characters you can exhume or stuff it with the Hardy Boys. I really don't care.It was simply a bad movie.The plot was simple enough, but apparently very hard to follow. Excuse me, hard for the movie itself to follow. They were to stop a man from taking over the world, starting a world war, stealing their ""powers"", and generally being an unruly scoundrel that destroys what he cannot control. On the other hand, this campy cartoon movie just couldn't keep its eyes on the prize.Departures for subplots I do not mind at all. But if you're going to flesh out the characters, then please give them some actual meat. Nemo had absolutely no character development at all. Allan Quatermain, the Merlin to Tom Sawyer's Arthur, was more the victim of terrible dialogue than he was of Sean Connery's typecasting. I did enjoy Tom's courting of Nina, but it went practically nowhere in the face of Dorian's ""betrayal"" of the entire group. Which reminds me, the red herring in that instance that was Skinner did nothing but keep the Invisible Man off the screen for a major portion of the movie. I couldn't have been more disappointed.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
230,codeE,You see yourself the great john bull,8,6 June 2013,"First off I have never read the comic/graphic novel, so I would not know how it translated. Most of the time book + imagination = better than movie. Secondly, any criticisms of the movie can be simply brushed off with, ""Sean Connery, check and mate sir."" I saw this with the family on opening night so the audience was very much on board. Everyone enjoyed the movie and then on the way home we talked about books! This was an unexpected bonus. The movie is set around the turn of the century in an obvious fantasy word inhabited with literary figures. A secret organization lead by a secret figure is using technological advancements to create and profit from a world war in the most convoluted way possible. So a group, or league if you will, is formed from literary figures each with a special trait or power. An invisible man. Not THE invisible man, but a man who is invisible. A female vampire who is hot, but also strong and smart. A very droll immortal. A shy scientist who changes into a raging beast. Captin Nemo, who has all the transportation needs handled. A young man in need of a father figure. And the ultimate father figure. Sean Connery, a man who has had a long career, seen and done it all, and is ready to retire, plays Allen Quatermain , a man who has had a long career, seen and done it all, and is ready to retire. Both are also grumpy. I fell hook line and sinker for the whole father son relationship between Quatermain and the Sowyer character. All of the characters worked well with each other and the movie is very enjoyable. Fast forward to present day. After watching this and THE AVENGERS back to back, I was struck with just how similar they are. Of course I think Mr. Hyde looks far better than CGI Hulk. Anyway, It is a good movie that you can watch with the kids and serves as a nice introduction to some great literary works.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
231,zzz05,better than the critics gave it credit for,8,20 August 2004,"Of course, I saw this on TV on cable, and a lot of movies are more palatable on TV for free than on the big screen for $9+. But that's mostly true for half-baked comedies, not 'action movies'. Anyway, this wasn't half bad; acting was good, characters were well defined, I particularly enjoyed Capt. Nemo and his high-tech very impressive gadgetry. Even on TV, the action was gripping and crisp, none of the murkiness that often infests similar epics (in an attempt at 'atmosphere', I presume) making video viewing a chore. Extras die like flies, something to consider if you're going to make this 'family night at the movies' and you're not training your kids to be sociopaths.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
232,eddy_currents,Extra ordinary movie,6,25 July 2003,"Snazzy special effects and extra stunning sets dress up an ordinary action movie.The biggest problem is in the direction. There is no subtlety, no hinting so the audience can figure things out for themselves. The plot is bland and uninspired, and predictable, and the director should have caught that. There is an attempt to mislead the audience as to the identity of the spy, but it is never really in doubt, because they so obviously to mislead us.The action is good in some spots, but often ruined by poor editing. Most of the fight scenes were individual close-up takes spliced together in a thoroughly jarring manner. Again, the director should have caught that.I liked the idea of using characters from classical literature, even though they took some liberties as to their abilities. I'm now interested in reading some of their stories. Of course, they had to put in a token American for the American audience, and they had to make him young and hunky for the girls in the audience. The action is good and the effects are quite good, but nothing new. The invisible effects are nice but pale in comparison to those in Hollow Man.The poor direction also shows in the many continuity issues. The story suddenly cuts to catching one major character without showing how they got there. Was there a linking scene that got cut out? When they are on the ship, the water around them isn't moving, yet when the scene cuts away, the ship is moving like a rocket through the water. When Mr. Hyde is underwater, no bubbles come from his mouth as he grunts. When they are standing in snow, no one gets snowflakes on their hair or shoulders.  The invisible guy has to be naked to be invisible, yet he can walk through snow for miles in bare feet without getting hypothermia.Most comic book adaptations try to keep the atmosphere of the comic while still making it seem ""plausible"". This one is not. Too bad, it held a lot of promise. In the hands of a director good with comic book adaptations (Raimi? Singer?) it could have been great.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
233,irishcoffee630,What Were They Thinking????,3,15 August 2003,"I got suckered into seeing this last night against my better judgement. Boy what a bad movie. The premise was interesting set in 1899, the League is made up of literary figures such as Dorian Gray, Mina Harker (Dracula), Dr. Jeckyll, Allan Quatermain, Capt. Nemo, and The Invisible Man who are recruited to stop another mad literary figure from taking over the world. Ok belief is suspended BUT this film is too wacky. For example: Driving a car (in 1899 London) no one on street thinks it is strange. This is just one of many unbelievable things in film. By midway through I was waiting for a television or an airliner to pop up. But the worst thing is the script. Terrible. Worst dialogue I have heard in a film since ""Showgirls"" or ""The Avengers"". I'm serious it is that bad. Also after first 20 min film is EXTREMELY boring and even gets sillier until final half hour. Lame quips and bad jokes do not a movie make. Last half hour was better though. I knew this is was undoubtedly a problem film beforehand since 20th Century Fox really did not promote it very much like other hopeful summer blockbusters. I guess the dismal box office proved that. I give it 3/10 only because I felt sorry for Sean Connery, who I like a lot, he produced this mess besides starring in it.

The movie was more about action and hollywood effects then witty plot and dialogue. If you are not familiar with the book at all then this should be an entertaining movie and should be worth the few bucks to go to the theatre or rent.

Make ""changes"" in a narrow-minded attempt to make a bigger buck!First, let's get rid of their main adversary, Fu Manchu.  (Why?  Political correctness, I suppose.)  And let's write out the ancestor of James, Campion Bond.  (If due to copyright problems, understandable.  If due to 'saving him for the sequel', stupid.)Next, let's adapt the Invisible Man's character (due to copyright), and add the characters Dorian Gray and the utterly useless and inappropriate TOM SAWYER to AMERICANIZE the film!  (How is it Shane West is STILL ACTING??!!! This portrayal is almost as bad as his faux English accent in 'Get Over It') Don't forget to give Mina Harker blatant vampire powers or she will never make a good action figure!For those of us that are even moderately well-read, the cherry on this proverbial pile of crap is the line,""Call me Ishmael"" delivered with such lack of meaning, other than a cheap chuckle, it's insulting.If you can somehow look past all of these factors, you might have seen a half-decent effects-laden adventure a la 'The Mummy' or 'X-Men 2'.  Give credit to the Jekyll/Hyde use of physical effects.  From the looks of it, those were all prosthetics, people; appreciate it for what it is.Finally, the truest tragedy of this film is that, if it had been good, MAYBE kids would have been interested in reading the original adventures of the great literary characters on which the comic was based!

237,lotsafun,a ripping yarn indeed!,10,28 July 2004,"I loved LXG! Oddly enough it seems to have confused some people. They couldn't figure it out at times. I had no problem following this flick. I love fun comic book styled stuff and LXG entertained the crap out of me. I also love the works of Verne, Wells, Haggard, Doyle, Twain, Wilde, and Stevenson. You can see why LXG really flipped my switch. I'm not sure why some people couldn't follow this. Some didn't know what to do with the info that Nemo had been a pirate. It's all been covered by Mr Verne folks. I'm not sure why some didn't know what to do with the info that Mina and Dorian had been an item. That was news to me too, but I didn't find that to be confusing at all. Can't we just learn things about these characters and not have every detail represent an even deeper meaning? This isn't extremely deep stuff folks. Some people seem to need to rip everything to shreds instead of enjoying the experience. This is not the book of Revelation or Citizen Kane.

But LXG has twists after twists after twists, you don't know if the characters in the team is a good guy or bad guy and back again.Will we see a sequel again? it depends upon the execs. but for me, LXG carries on itself solely it doesn't need a sequel.

239,kargaan,Good Popcorn Movie,7,10 November 2010,"OK the first thing I desperately want to get out of the way in this review is addressing the critics. Ebert and Roeper have no idea what they're talking about. Roger Ebert said the movie was ""incomprehensible"". OK what? What can you not comprehend about the movie Roger? It's a fantasy movie. They're not trying to be historically accurate. In fact it tells you at the beginning of the movie that it is set in an alternate 1899 where there was a huge leap in technology. Oh and one more thing Mr. Ebert, There are roads in Venice. Now that I have this out of the way lets get to my review. TLoEG is one of those movies where a bunch of Legendary heroes join forces to take on an evil villain bent on ruling the world. You know, the usual. Sean Connery is, as you'd expect, the Savior of this movie. Without him the movie would be boring and mediocre. The movie certainly looks good but a lot of the CGI effects seem unfinished especially the scene in Venice where the buildings are crumbling. Other than that the special effects were pretty good. The action scenes would have been great if they hadn't of been shot so poorly. The camera is so close in the action that we can hardly see what's going on. And to add to the confusion, that camera makes very quick cuts during the action. The movie is corny and we've seen these kind of movies before but it's fun and refreshing to watch.

I was pleased to see that Captain Nemo was true to the original Verne, as opposed to the Disney Nemo.  Some of the special effects looked a little flat, and the fight between Mr. Hyde and the Incredible Hulk looked too CGish.This one isn't high art, or deep meaning - this is just a fun movie.

I liked the action overall, although several sequences, like the Nautilus and its sets, were simply over the top.Most disappointing was the inclusion of Mina Harker (Stoker must be twirling in his grave, poor man) as a vampiress(!) in the League and as yet another classic female character ""updated"" for the so-called ""sensibilities"" of the modern audience, i.e., she can *physically* hold her own with the men of the cast (do we really need yet another nonsensical Lara Croft/Xena/Buffy fantasy character -- guess so, if one is to appeal to the barely literate modern youth audience). Better to not have had her at all -- why not instead find some way to include maybe a distant *male* relative of Baron von Frankenstein, Greystoke or Sherlock Holmes??I understand that the film is also based on a graphic novel and I have made a note to check it out...But I'm in no hurry to do so...",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
242,stamp1,"Not Perfect, But Entertaining",8,24 July 2003,"After reading the comments of others who say this movie was terrible, I have to disagree and encourage moviegoers to go see this film for themselves. I thought it had a lot of action, great special effects, and an interesting plot. (However you will have to suspend your sense of disbelief like you do with other Sci-Fi & Comic Book movies). It is like the Hulk movie, you have to accept that a man can become a green, raging, giant, monster when he loses his temper if you are going to enjoy it. If you can't accept that point, why are you going to see the Hulk movie? It is the same with this film, LXG, if you can't accept that Victorian characters from classic authors such as H.G. Wells, or Robert Louis Stevenson, or Jules Verne, or Bram Stoker, or Mark Twain or Arthur Conan Doyle, or Victor Hugo get together to save the world & use their unique powers to fight the world's greatest evil fictional character of the Victorian era, THEN WHY ARE YOU IN THE MOVIE THEATER WATCHING THIS FILM? Stay home & watch your reality TV instead!! (I find the people on Jerry Springer Show & the things they claim to have been doing in their sordid lives far more unbelievable than what the heroes & villains of LXG do.)I found that this movie reminded me of the old 1960's TV show, ""The Wild, Wild West"", set in Europe instead of the American wild west. They use an unbelievable submarine to travel around in instead of an unbelievable railroad car. The Tom Sawyer character (who came to Europe from America to help defeat the villain) was very much like the Mr. West character on the show, but blond, younger, and cuter. He was a good shot, took charge, was full of non-stop energy, & a great fighter. (The actor who played him is also a Mr. West (Shane West). Coincidence?) You already know the other characters from your high school (or college) English Literature courses. Brief List: Allan Quatermain, Capt. Nemo (Jules Verne), Ishmael (Moby Dick), Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde (Robert Louis Stevenson, but when he is terrorizing Paris at night, with the giant humps in his back, then he is the Hunchback of Notre Dame-Victor Hugo), Dorian Grey (The Picture of Dorian Grey), The Invisible Man (H.G. Wells), Bram Stoker's Dracula, etc. Just like the WWW old TV series, the evil villain in this movie is a mad, incredibly smart genius who invents futuristic weapons years ahead of their time (such as tanks, flame throwers, huge bombs on timers, etc.) Does this sound familiar to Wild Wild West viewers? Of course it is, it sounds just like Dr. Loveless! So for all the other reviewers who said it is crazy to have weapons in 1899 that didn't exist then, I guess they thought the Wild, Wild West TV show was crazy also. THIS IS SCI-FI FANTASY, IT REQUIRES A SUSPENSION OF REALITY TO APPRECIATE THE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE ASPECT OF THE MOVIE!!! Just like to enjoy Star Trek or Star Wars or Stargate SG-1, you have to accept the writers alternate vision of reality to get into the story!!Anyway, I didn't think the movie was perfect in a year of so many perfect and fantastic movies so far, but I thought it was entertaining for 2 hours, and interesting, and I was impressed by the special effects used. (I thought the Nautilus sub was REALLY NEAT!!) I also thought the Mr. Hyde character was more realistic & believable visually than the Hulk had been. (A lot of people reviewing that movie complained the Hulk wasn't realistic enough, they thought he looked like a silly CGI character and wasn't real enough, so Mr. Hyde in this movie should satisfy those people.) I enjoyed my free popcorn & eating my hot dog & drinking my large soft drink & thought it was 2 hrs. I spent escaping from reality enjoyably.

I haven't read the graphic novel this film is based on, but Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Dr Jekyll, Dorian Gray, Mina Harker & the Invisible Man are the classic heroes that make up the League in this story.Definitely an idea with great potential, but it's executed in this film with no sense of subtlety or substance. What little plot there is has to do with the usual - madman trying to destroy the world, except here he's trying to start World War I, not World War III.Most of the young cast appears to have been selected for their looks, not any sort of acting ability. Watching these pretty, talentless young things deliver their typically moronic action-film lines in a 'dignified' fashion to emphasize the fact that this is all happening 100 years ago (that's what people all talked like back then, right?) is just painful.Sean Connery sleepwalks his way through a role that he clearly has no interest in, & Richard Roxburgh seems embarrassed by the whole mess.Normally the special effects in brain-dead movies like this are a redeeming feature, but I was actually struck by how poorly they were used, & just how unrealistic they looked.

Ms. Wilson rocked, and every single scean she was in she held your attention.What I liked the most besides the interesting story line was that each character gets their own sequence in which we learn something about them individually.

245,DarkLugia1969,A League Of Its Own (I Guess),8,24 July 2003,"-Note this comment may contains spoilers so you have been warned-The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or LXG for short is based on a comic created by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill that consist of British fictional characters: Allan Quartermain (Sir Sean Connery), Mina Harker aka Mina Murray (Peta Wilson), Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah), Doctor Henry Jekyll/Mister Edward Hyde (Jason Flemyng) and Rodney Skinner/the Invisible Man (Tony Curran).  The major differences between the movie and the actual comic is that the movie added two American fictional characters: Tom Sawyer (Shane West) and Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend).  Plus, the original Invisible Man (Doctor Griffin) is in the comic apparently die in the movie (that's why Skinner is in his stead). Why do most directors put their personal spin on any comic adaption movie?The movie overall is very good with a lot of action and suspense.  The Phantom is in disguise an old villian of one of the world's greatest detective (you should know by now).  Another major difference is that Quartermain in the movie is the leader instead of Harker as the leader.

I could try to list the numerous failures, but I don't think I've got sufficient space here (nor the time for it). This waste of money and time (no brains involved) is an embarassment for everybody involved, and I feel ashamed for Connery to act and even co-produce (as executive producer) in something that makes Plan 9 look intellectual.If you haven't seen it, avoid it.

250,RockytheBear,"I actually saw an early premiere screening of this movie back in 99, when its original title was Mystery Men...",3,16 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, or LXG for all you druggies, is a misleading title, because the movie doesn't feature TK Carter, Verne Troyer, or Mr. T.  Instead we get an action flick starring the ever aging Sean Connery.  How he was picked as the lead for this film is the movie's biggest mystery.  Sean Connery is 73 years old, and looks every day of it. Yet, we are supposed to believe when he sails through the air, or leaps backwards from tables firing handguns John Woo style, or jumps out of a moving car and lands on his feet.Sean Connery plays Allan Quatermain, a geriatric adventurer.  He is relaxing in Kenya when an old British chap informs him he is wanted in Great Britain to possibly thwart a world war at the hands of the world's least frightening villain named The Fantom.  He goes, where he meets the organizer of the escapade; a man named ""M.""  Joining Quatermain on his adventure will be U.S. spy Tom Sawyer, the completely useless Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, a vampire who at will pulls magic bats out of nowhere, Skinner the Invisible Man, Dorian Gray the Immortal, and Dr. Jekyll aka Mr. Hyde, a combination of Quasimodo, Bane from Batman, and Vin Diesel.Skinner wears white make up when he wants to be seen, but the amount he wears shifts, depending on how the editors feel at the time.  Mina the vampire not only has a fleet of bat friends (what the hell is that all about?) but also cleans herself in a mirror after she attacks a man. Helloooo!  Last time I checked, vampires and mirrors didn't mix.  And never mind the fact that she practically sunbathes atop Nemo's ship, The Nautilus. And since we're talking about The Nautilus, let me mention that it is about the size of the Sears Tower on it's side.  This immense ship may stay afloat on the ocean, but how it manages to stay afloat and sail on those small little rivers in the streets of Venice is beyond me.As for the movie itself, yes, it's pretty stupid.  I was most interested in the Dorian Gray character.  Dorian turns out to be a traitor, and I thought that was when the movie was going to become interesting.  After all, an Immortal cannot be killed.  But Dorian does have a weakness-- a painting of himself.  Now, if the only thing that could kill you was a painting of yourself, wouldn't you destroy the painting?  Dorian doesn't.  He waits until someone gift wraps it, and keeps it with them for blackmail purposes. And when Mina finally does show it to him, why didn't Dorian just look away or shut his eyes?  He decides to look right at it and study it like it's one of those 3-D eye jumbles at the mall.  Then he dies and it scares Mina. She actually jumps, like she hasn't been seeing death (as well as causing it) for the past hundred years.The movie not only defies logic, but it is directed at a poor level.  The editing is sloppy, the camera repeatedly shakes, and every scene is shot in pitch black.  I mentioned earlier that The Fantom was not frightening in the least.  When his true identity is revealed, he becomes even less frightening.  And what's up with that cornball ending?  Quatermain is tough as nails throughout the movie, but at the end he turns into margarine and dies so easily by a pocket knife to the shoulder.  Then some hokey pokey voodoo dude (ooo, scary) does some abracadabra over his grave.  Was that a hint towards a sequel?  I hate endings like this.  I call this the ""cover your ass"" ending, meaning it can go either way.  If the movie is successful, it can be used as a sequel opener.  If the movie fails, it can be used as a ""Oh, well, he was just a crazy old voodoo guy.""  Actually I hope a sequel is made.  That way, I can howl at the screen at an 80 year old Sean Connery in his power wheelchair fighting bad guys with his colostomy bag.

Leaving little left to attract a winning, big name cast, Sean Connery's $17 million performance is reminiscent of an elder statesman who didn't understand what he was signing up for... and it's not hard to wonder why. An incomprehensible plot, grating dialogue and under-utilised ensemble drag this to the depths of so-bad-it's-bad.

256,Ithorianjedimaster2,Van Helsing was better.,5,21 May 2007,"""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" came out around the time of ""Van Helsing"", which seemed like they were also wanting to bring back all the classic horror movie characters to the big screen, buuuut . . . in LEG's case, it doesn't work as well as it should.You are introduced to Alan Quartermain, a man who was once some kind of great agent in the UK, until he turned his back on them after the dead of his son, but his 'retirement' doesn't last as long as he wanted, because an agent, sent by the Queen, goes to Alan, who is lounging in Africa, and tells him about ""Fantom"", a masked terrorist who wants to take over the world with 'futuristic' weapons, like tanks, for example. Well, Alan joins the hunt for Fantom after an unplanned invitation from Fantom's minions.Alan is summoned to ""M"", who announces that he is now part of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who consists of Mina Harker (who has been changed into a vampire by Dracula, therefore going against the original ending in Bram Stoker's novel), Captain Nemo (from ""Moby Dick), Rodney Skinner (a thief who accidentally stumbled upon the stuff that made the Invisible Man invisible), and shortly after, Tom Sawyer himself (but how a fence-painting, river-boating boy from Missouri end up with a gun and the U.S. government, I don't know.) After introductions, we are then introduced to two more ""gentlemen"" who are recommended to join the League: Dr. Jekyll and Dorian Grey. After another uninvited visit from Fantom and his crew, the LEG set off to stop him from taking over the world, though there is a point of betrayal and even a son/father relationship that builds between Alan and Tom Sawyer.But the LEG is made up of people who resemble horror movie characters, or the low runners from the classic horror movies. When they thought about Mina Harker, I think they thought originally of Dracula, but when Van Helsing took that idea, they decided to alter the ending to Bram Stoker's book to make a character that didn't appease to most Dracula fans, me included. You have Captain Nemo, who is the builder of the first submarine/cruise-liner and the automobile, defiling the history text books. Skinner is an okay character, but he doesn't have much of a role and it's sort of disappointing, especially when the director thought his finishing line for killing someone should be ""Night night!"" Tom Sawyer is another decent character, but when you notice he fancies Mina, you just roll your eyes because of how stupid the idea is. I also am confused as to how he went from a Missouri troublemaker to some 'secret' agent of the government, oh well.Dr. Jekyll, who lets Hyde do all the hard work, is actually another disappointment, because they, first off, make a big and bulky Mr. Hyde like in Van Helsing, but they gave him some characteristics of an ape, like his shriek and just his general movements. Also, Hyde is supposed to be the pure EVIL side of Jekyll, so why is he agreeing to save the world? Dr. Jekyll is, of course, the weak and nearly-worthless addition to the League and he won't shut up about being afraid of Mr. Hyde going on a rampage, when it is clear that Hyde is on the good side and doesn't seem that dangerous. Finally, you have Dorian Grey, the immortal with the aging self portrait that, when gazed upon, will reverse the affect, thus killing him, joins the League because he wants to overcome some personal 'demons'.The acting in the movie is okay, though Dorian doesn't seem like the sly-as-a-wolf guy, more like a Aristocratic jerk, and I also noticed that Mina seems too calm at times and when she tries to act tough, like when she shouts ""Save your bullets! These men are mine!"", I actually laughed at how desperate the actress was when trying to pull off a scary voice. Skinner is fun and Sean Connery, being the expert actor and all, is probably the best performance, though it appears that the experienced actor is surrounded by newbies at times.The plot? Okay, but will they stop with whole ""love interest"" thing that is going on with Tom Sawyer and Dr. Jekyll, who want to get in Mina's pants, because it just a little too out-of-place when it comes to characterizations. I think the reason Sean Connery wanted to be in this movie, because it looks a lot like a 007 movie meeting horror movie classics. You have the masked, fur-coat-with-cane villain who is a genius and wants to take over the world, and you have the experienced agent who wants to stop him. I think he should have stuck to memories of ""From Russia with Love"".In terms of special effects, acting, and the script, I'd give the movie a C-, because there is very little special effects (and the effects that are there are pretty lousy), the acting seems a little low-graded when you see how much more-of-an-actor Sean Connery is when compared with the 'newbies', and with the ""Mina being the love interest of three gentlemen"" and the clique plot twist that I don't want to give away. Van Helsing wasn't that good of a movie, but it looks a little like ""Return of the King"" to ""Alone in the Dark"", when compared with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"".",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Even Dorian Gray, a simple but subtly complex character, becomes a compelling and workable superhero.  Unfortunately, the writers tried to squeeze three movies into one, in an impossible attempt to blow our minds, resulting in a pile of cliches and hopelessly predictable plot twists.

I expect the makers are not really interested in the Academy Awards; it's a movie for fun.With that in mind I enjoyed it. The story line, well the interesting part is I thought that if this was made in 2 years time and the main character name was Indiana Jones instead of Quatermain you probably wouldn't notice. Let's face it, Worlds in trouble, call in the hero's, fight the bad guys who are terrible shots and win.The special effects were good, some of the previous reviews complained but hey everyone is using the same software and how real is real. The real originality was in the characters. The Victorian Hero's with a bit of class and mystery about them. I'd have loved to know who were the previous Extraordinary Gentlemen were, after M's comment to Mina that her old friend was a reluctant member of the previous League. (Dracula?)

I've been waiting for him to return to his no nonsense action roles.  This film wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but one of the better ones I've seen this summer.  Though i'm not familiar with the graphic novel this is based on, I do know they added Tom Sawyer into the movie to add an american touch.  This didn't really hurt or help the movie much though. Overall a good summer action flick with some classic Connery. ... gotta love the invisible man (skinner). :)",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
260,lhseaglerunner,I am Thoroughly Angry and Insulted,1,16 July 2003,"I will be the first to admit that a good movie doe not need to be intellectually stimulating (see last week's review), but then again, one should not expect to go to a show (in this week's case, `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen') and then emerge 100-some minutes later significantly more on the stupid side than he/she was before the movie started?	In the months before the dawn of the 20th Century, the world is facing a massive war, brought upon by terrorist attacks by a masked villain/arms dealer named the Fantom (not a typo). To combat this, a functionary in the British Empire called M (Richard Roxburgh) has assembled a team of individuals culled from Victorian Literature to head off the Fantom's plans.	The roster reads: Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), expert hunter/adventurer; invisible thief Rodney Skinner (Tony Curran); inventor Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah); vampire Mina Harker (Peta Wilson); unstable Dr. Jekyll/Mr.Hyde (Jason Flemyng); immortal Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend); American Secret Service Agent Tom Sawyer (Shane West).	In a fantastical series of explosions, chases and drawn-out scenes of tedium, the so-called `League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' travels from Paris to Venice, to an industrial complex in Mongolia, in hope of adverting war.	Coming into the movie, I was familiar with all of the characters (except for Quatermain and Skinner--but he is explained PDQ) through their original medium (not the graphic novel from which this was adapted), and, to be succinct, I was appalled by the butchery of these great literary figures that was committed within the movie. The biggest atrocities come in the characters of Dorian Gray (who, in Wilde's work, was NOT immortal, just morally corrupt and youthful) and Mr. Hyde (more of a psychological transformation, according to Stevenson, and to be sure, Hyde did NOT miraculously grow to the size of a small house).	Perhaps I could be more forgiving if logic had not been tossed out the window. In the first half of the movie, one can see: an automobile race through the streets of Venice (and there really are NO major streets in that fair city), a 5-story submarine negotiate the Venetian canals (which are certainly not deep enough for the Nautilus), the same submarine, which, on the outside appear to be blade-thin, but, according to the film, is large enough to approximate a cruise liner on the inside (I bet the crews of the Ohio-class submarines would appreciate this type of reality distortion). I could go on and on, but then I'd get too worked up and succumb to a stroke or something and leave this column unfinished.	Perhaps as a concession, I can say that the acting is decent, but looking back, I can safely assume that this was one of Sean Connery's last appearances as the lead in an action film-the dude is getting old and it shows.	I can put up with most movies, but when one that is mediocre to begin with assumes the temerity to insult my intelligence, THAT is unforgivable. Director Stephen Norrington should be severely chastised for this effort (or lack thereof). This movie, for being insulting and seat-twistingly bad, gets a big fat ZERO. (And no, I am not bitter).",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
261,lonicelee,Good movie - not so much!!,4,18 August 2007,"Good special effects but a poorly done movie overall. I was unable to unhook my brain as others have suggested. I didn't know anything of the book it's based on nor the history of Nemo, etc. so I should have been the easiest viewer to impress. I totally agree with another reviewer who said ""the implementation is rather abysmal"". *** SPOILER ALERT *** These people had talents but most weren't that extraordinary to logically survive sprays of automatic gunfire. All of Nemo's fighting scenes looked fake. The only things extraordinary about him were his ship and car. I've never been to Venice but my first thought was how is this ship going to fit in their tiny canals. There are many other moments like this where you think wtf? If it weren't for Dorian Gray, Mr. Hyde and the Nautilus, it would have been a total waste of film. In the DVD extras, Sean Connery said he didn't ""fancy"" the script at first. He thought it was too ""tricksy"". But then he thought about movies like the Matrix and how things were done with special effects so he went ahead. A few changes might have helped but I don't know if this could ever be a good movie since the story is so bad. Some complain that Mr. Hyde was too over the top. He was one of the few things I enjoyed. Just an angry version of Dr. Jekyl would have been as boring as Tom Sawyer's character.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

264,WheezyJoe,"Extraordinary Gentlemen, Extra Ordinary Film.",5,21 October 2003,"Finding it's way from the pages of a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill to the big screen, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is an intriguing story that mixes together some of literatures most astonishing characters of the 1800's. It's a fascinating concept that inevitably craves plenty of action and excitement but above the surface, where it's plain to see, is a thick layer of bad scripts for a disjointed story.Considering the very fabric of this idea derives from classic literature there's nothing lauding or spectacular about it. I had imagined a great tale of intrigue and adventure but found that without a strong story to accommodate all these amazing characters the novelty wears out rather fast. Sadly and unpretentiously director Stephen Norrington fails to enhance the film beyond its grand design and special effects, which are the films only major strengths.Every character is represented with a very tongue-in-cheek attitude that would have worked well if not for the incoherent narrative that accompanied them. The film starts off with a bang using action and its unique concept to entice you. With such a large handful of thrilling characters it's not hard to get excited. It didn't have a lot of work to do to become one of the best action movies of the year with an original concept to spawn a new franchise for Fox. The visual effects, though not groundbreaking, were up to the task and are adequately housed within the ornamented production design. Trevor Jones's score is a major highlight that shows off his strengths when scoring for action with a full orchestral ensemble.The weight of such an uninvolving story is what ultimately keeps the audience from stepping out and enjoying themselves. It's hard to be swept away in a story when all you get is a series of events with no hint of tangibility in sight. Even with fantastical tales such as this it's easy enough to do, just look at X-Men or Lord of the Rings. I'm thinking that 20th Century Fox was hoping this would be another X-Men or their version of DC comics JLA (Justice League of America), but sadly it is not to be. For the first half hour I was really enjoying myself and getting wrapped up in the excitement but inevitably, as time drew on, I also found myself struggling to shrug-off the plot holes and bad dialogue to a point where I ended up just not caring (which thankfully helped to past the time).Score - 2 out of 5",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
265,Will_Scarlet,"Fails to impress, in spite of a marvelous cast, stunning special effects, and promising writers.",6,1 December 2003,"The best thing about this movie would be its cast.  Sean Connery is wonderful as Allan Quatermain, as is Neseeruddin Shah as Nemo, in spite of the fact that his character does very little in relation to the story.  Jason Flemyng as Jekyll/ Hyde works out their battling duel natures to perfection, and Tony Curran ishilarious as the Invisible Man.  Credit is also due to Peta Wilson, StuartTownsend, and Richard Roxburgh.  The movie's weak point is it's script.  Thestory is passable, truly in the style of the detective/sci-fi novels of the Victorian era.  But the dialogue in between is melodramatic and overdone.  Not that itdoesn't have its moments.  The writers have great promise, they write Curran's humorous parts perfectly, and are rather good at handling dramatic moments. Perhaps they are just inexperienced with action movies.  The weakest point of the script is the final battle sequence, during which Quatermain, suddenly, out of nowhere, from no evidence previously mentioned or revealed in the film,reveals that 'M' is ""James Moriarty, the Napoleon of Crime!""  and Moriarty, in the movie's worst line, says, ""That name died at Reichenbach Falls, and I wasreborn!""  It makes little, if any sense.  Another puzzling matter is Dorian Gray and Mina Harker.  It seems the director of the Blade movies can't resist addingvampires to this!  Mina is too much Blade to remind you at all of Dracula's victim, and her explanation of the Dracula adventure destroys some of her character's potential.  Dorian Gray is also overdone, a little too Matrix, and if Mina has only been immortal since Dracula bit her, how would she know Dorian Gray from""way back?""  The effects are visually dazzling, though a little overdone. You do get feelings of what this movie could have been, and it could have beenamazing, had it followed the book more closely.

Hello? This movie has vampires, monsters, immortals and invisible men and the detail that gets on your nerves is the date...? So tell me, Mr. Historian, when was invisibility discovered...?And then there are people saying ""the real Mr. Hyde would never do things that way"". Excuse me? There is no real Mr. Hyde. It's a fictional character. That's the whole point.In fact, most people's criticism of this film suggest they were expecting a documentary. Which ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is not.What it is, is a rather entertaining movie with good acting, generally good special effects and good photography, that will probably get a few laughs out of you. It's a good movie. If the fight scenes were a bit slower and less noisy (what is it with sound these days, are all the sound engineers going deaf, or is it just ""louder is better""?), it would be excellent.It may not follow the original comic book to the letter (apparently it went into pre-production before the book was finished), but it still feels like a comic book, or an animated film (it never takes itself seriously).

There were certainly some pacing and editing problems in the second act, but for the most part, it lived up to most of the hype.  I was certainly entertained, which is more than I can say for a lot of the films I've seen recently.  The literary one-liners were fun, and the plot twists were unpredictable, which was nice for a change.  A lot of the reviewers complained about the car chase and about Peta Wilson's acting, the latter seems nuts, haven't any of these people actually read Dracula?  She pretty much stuck to how I imagined her character to be.  Most of the rest of the characters were the same.  Another major complaint was American secret service agent Tom Sawyer, which definitely was a bit of a dorky addition to the cast, but on the other hand, it could've been a lot worse.

269,sheepie87,I really have to say it: Extraordinary!,10,23 June 2007,"I believe that the box office failure of this film is due to the American Public's utter lack of literacy--I mean real literacy, where one reads all the classics, not just being forced to wallow through Wuthering Heights in high school (don't get me wrong--I love Wuthering Heights. Just what they read around here.). Most people seem very confused, as in ""Who are these people?"" I noticed one person confusedly remarked ""Dorian Grey is immortal?"" Yes, my dear. Painting, hello? Let's all blame Roger Ebert, too--can you imagine if he had a portrait? Ew.Anyway, enough bashing on American tastes: this was an excellent film. I really liked all of the characters--skillfully rethought and redrawn, but still retaining the essentials. Sean Connery-fabulous, as always, but the real standout here is Stuart Townsend and his Dorian Grey. He's made up to look almost exactly like Oscar Wilde (except a bit too short, Wilde was quite tall) and dandily double-crosses with aplomb, style, and (of course!) wit. My favorite line from the whole movie: Phantom's trooper: Who are you? DG: I'm complicated.Love!

271,robastyk,A delightful idea spoiled,3,8 May 2006,"What I found most disappointing about this movie was how profoundly and completely it failed in acting, direction, script, and even art direction. You don't have to be stupid to like it, or even illiterate, but you do have to be challenged in your knowledge of the books from which the character derive and your knowledge of history.The art directors, all 5 of them, seem to have decided that slapping a bit of late-Victorian gingerbread onto some contemporary designs served to indicate period and inventiveness. It failed miserably in both regards. The Nautilus in Richard Fleischer's 1954 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea seemed far more Victorian and more futuristic than the outsized nuclear sub cum battleship of this film. Capt. Nemo's Cord sedan is just an embarrassment as is the situation that asks us to believe that Tom Sawyer, who's never seen such a thing before, becomes an accomplished stunt driver with no practice.Some comic book/movies take us on a ride that, like a good roller-coaster catches us up and keeps our attention as long as it lasts. The original RoboCop (1987) comes to mind in that regard. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen telegraphs its plot and then plods about trying to make its creaky, clanky script come to life but never pulls enough juice out of the heavens to maker it seem like anything but dead meat.Norrington's background in creating special effects is probably the biggest millstone around this movie's neck. He gets caught up in things like the Mr. Hyde battle in the climax that only bog the plot down.The premise is a great one: what if some of the most memorable characters of the literature of the last third of the 19th Century all got together to save the world from disaster? If you'd like to see a movie that does a similar premise well, I'd suggest Herbert Ross' 1976 The Seven Percent Solution or Nicholas Meyer's 1979 Time After Time. Watched in chronological sequence with this film, I think anyone will understand why League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is extraordinary only as a completely missed opportunity.I ended the film thinking that David Hemmings had the best part in the whole movie. His character's done for in the first 5 minutes. He got to pick up his check, go home and forget he ever had anything to do with this failure.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

You didn't need to give them the means to stop you if you were just going to double cross them halfway through the movie. You even left them a recording of your plans just to show how smart you are but you could have had these things already. We know you had Nemo's technology for months, if not years, because you had 8 Nautili in the works.

274,jasonw-5,Never lives up to the capable cast,4,28 December 2003,"It begins with a rather impressive list of literary characters played by a formidable cast of up-and-coming actors and one very established favorite, Sean Connery. An impressive cast gathered for what could have been a stronger film. The story, fictional heroes and villains teamed together to battle an enemy of mother England, has great potential.  And therein lies the problem with the film, it is great potential wasted as too many under established professionals attempt to step outside their comfort zones.Thirty minutes into the film you've been introduced to all the characters and a complicated story of intrigue is about to develop. Unfortunately this is where things get drawn out, cheesy and just plain forgettable. By the end it's a cliché action-adventure with a creative group that ends up trying too hard. For instance, the special effects team goes over-the-top in creating a comparable foe for Hyde ruining the impressive work done up to then.  By concentrating more on story, the filmmaker and his team could have had more pride in creative characters without the crutch of special effects. 
As I write this I still have twinge of interest in the literary characters brought to life for me once again.  If a sequel were proposed they would need to go back to the drawing board rather than trying to improve upon what's been started.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

However, like myself, if you came to this film with no prior knowledge of the comics then it's an enjoyable 00s steampunk action movie.

276,TimeTrvlr03,What a mess . . .,3,12 July 2003,"With such rich backstory, both from the original novels and the modern graphic novel, there was no reason why this movie could not have been a success.  From the beginning, this movie was fraught with problems, not the least of which was the overuse of special effects explosions and rather improbable effects situations (e.g. the Nautilus was enormous, yet managed to easily navigate the canals of Venice).  Even within the bounds of sci-fi, there was just a little too much stretching.Another huge impediment was character development and interaction between characters.  The movie had a frenetic, jerky pace and there wasn't sufficient explanation of the characters and why there were there.  I did some searching before the movie on the official website and only though that was I adequately prepared to understand what was going on in the movie. Not even reading the novels would make understanding the movie easier.  What's worse is that these are all talented actors and actresses and they were sorely misused.  Half the time I felt as if the actors had filmed their scenes independent of the rest of the cast.  The only two for whom the script worked were Peta Wilson and Stuart Townshend.  Overall the movie felt like a series of vignettes poorly strung together into an uneven, barely intelligible mess.Though I realize this was based on a graphic novel, and thereby designed to play out in snappy, quick segments, the writers really should have worked harder to make the scenes fit together as they should have.  They could have dropped the Venice scene entirely and simply focused on figuring out the identity of the Fantom and tracking him to his factory.Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is the butchery of the classic novels from which the characters are drawn.  There are numerous literary quips in the movie that likely won't click for those who aren't well-versed in the Victorian and Regency classics.  Most of the literary references are poorly explained (e.g. John Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes and the real identity of 'M').  And I agree with an earlier reviewer who was disappointed with the treatment of many of the charaters (e.g. the suddenly wussy Mr. Hyde and the rather meek vampire Mina Harker).The ultimate lesson from this movie is that if you are going to make a piece of crap, do it with actors who will draw the bucks to the theater.  Which was the only thing the directors did well.  This movie was a mess and I would suggest not wasting your money.  Rating - 2.5/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

But it's not.It'll be enjoyed by people who like to hear Connery utter such inane phrases as ""The League is set"" and ""The game is on,"" but if these dialogue gems don't get your blood pumping, you probably won't enjoy this movie.  The action is completely over the top and unbelievable, especially some of the scenes in Venice.  Just painful to watch, really.Skip the movie and go check out the books from your local library.

279,soymaid327,"If you liked The Mummy, this will be more guilty fun",5,1 July 2005,"There are advantages to being ignorant, as film noir likes to point out. I read the Lord of the Rings only after seeing the movies -- while my friends moaned to each other about Tom Bombadil, I saw the movie by itself before adding the context later on. I'm glad I did, and I think it worked well here, too.This movie has serious flaws. Its hopes for consistent internal logic, not to mention the insane idea that it is possible in real-world history, are both to be discarded. None of that. When it does something so implausible it hurts (a car racing through the streets in... Venice?), the story is hurt is as well. It is proficient at using the characters' individual strengths, but when in a scene Dr Jekyll's character is supposed to experience actual emotional development, it really, really, really doesn't work. Somebody in writing forgot that in order to make peace from conflict and have it mean anything, this conflict must be visible to the audience, not just a few mutterings inaudible under the tense music.This said, the movie's main flaw seems to be that it is incurably silly, and that is something I (for one) always forgive. I know the concepts each character is based around, but haven't read the novels containing them in so long that other details escape me. As I said before, this is just as well: consistency, if you're going to make Dorian invulnerable to bullets, is neither desirable nor attainable.If you're able to laugh at the ridiculousness of it all (and maybe cringe your way through some of the dialogue), you'll get a passable flick. Not sure why all the hatred -- personally, I like a bit of lunacy with my action, and the clichés (the young buck and old tiger, the woman who sits through the insults and then impresses everyone at a more dramatic time, the betrayal that is pretty obviously not what everyone thinks) are time-honored and very satisfying. Plus, fun to watch just to see Sean Connery finally give up all hope of ever mastering an English accent. Good old Sean.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I know people who like this movie so I give it a 6,for visual effects. Was it because I do not know who is Quatermain, I thought they should have included Sherlock Holmes, I found Nemo not to be as interesting as he should, because they crammed a 2 movie story into one.

283,vaudevillejones,"Good idea, bad execution",3,24 October 2005,"I think the most important thing to say about this movie, having read other reviews, is this: it's not based on the original graphic novel. What they have effectively done is bought the rights to the name and the idea of assembling a league of fictional C19 adventurers. Beyond that, forget Alan Moore. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing in itself. There are deeper themes to this film if one is prepared to look- the political struggles in Europe, for instance. The influence that C19 characters had on our modern heroes. And the design and mood of the film captures the sense of a fin-de-siecle world on the brink of collapse well. The basic plot is not bad for a popcorn film. It's a shame, then, that these deeper themes are hidden beneath layers of rubbish. The characters are wooden and the dialogue terrible. One of the joys of the original graphic novel was spotting subtle literary references- the equivalent in this movie is to have Sean Connery comment that while he arrived quickly, Phileas Fogg would have been quicker (just in case you don't get the reference, he then adds that said character circumnavigated the globe in 80 days). The fictional heroes offer the potential for some amazing character interaction, but become standard Hollywood archetypes- the tough old guy, the devil-may-care young buck, the cheeky cockney and so forth. With a better script, this could have been fantastic. Shame it didn't have one.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

285,stuckfly,Fun Action Film,7,31 July 2003,"League is based on a graphic novel.  To all those viewers who've given it a bad rating for lack of depth and realism and acting: Get A Clue.To increase any of those qualities would require two things.  First, the author of the graphic novel upon which the film is based would have to agree to alter the story utterly, which is very unlikely.  Second, the film would need another hour.  On behalf of my butt, I wish to express relief that another hour was not added to this film.What it lacks in meaningful drama, it makes up with plentiful action. There's a bit of every sort of effect.  A couple things that even comic book addicts couldn't possibly swallow, but they're short sequences.  The story moves very quickly to keep you from thinking.  Just let it happen and enjoy the ride.The characters are all interesting, but there's no time for development. You'll get a sense that backgrounds and emotional depth are stuffed in like mortar, which they are.  Just enough to explain things, but the attempts are a bit distracting.If you expect a grand performance from Connery, you'll be disappointed.  The part does not call for his considerable acting talents.  It does take advantage of his age, charm, and trademark stout Scottish persona. Thankfully, he does not ""carry"" the film.  The members of the supporting cast do very well on their own (except for the American secret agent, who should have been excluded from the story anyway).  Again, none of the parts call for stellar acting.Your eyeball muscles will get a major workout, but hey...no pain, no gain.

286,wessel-1,Enjoyable (Spoilers),9,21 July 2003,"Well, I enjoyed the film, from characters to story. There were only a few things which I didn't like that much:* it wasn't a 1:1 version of the first comic book - the story of the book would have been very nice on screen, especially with a Mina which isn't powerful because she's a vampire but because she's a lady (which even intrigues Quartermain), an Alan Quartermain who is a drug addict (I suppose that would have been too much for Mr. Connery), and other much darker characters (like the things the invisible man did to the girls or what Mr. Hyde did when he ""terrorized"" Paris).* Capain Nemo was rather a disappointment - his beard just looks wrong. He has his moments (like the discussion with Quartermain), but I thought Nemo would be more stern and cynical (especially about the english).* Originally I liked Tom Sawyer, but after I read in the trivia that he was just included so that the americans like the movie more -- I saw his role in a new light which was ... not so good. This would be a very poor reason to include a character in a movie (and in my opinion shameful for americans and their approach to movies).* The Nautilus is just too big - it's a great ship, but it looks pretty oversized for that time. Granted, I enjoy Steampunk and wouldn't mind if they'd use Aether to make ships fly, but the way this ship looked -- it just felt wrong (although the scene is pretty cool when it emerges out of the water). The same thing goes for the car and the rocket (the last thing especially).But besides these points (and perhaps some others I did miss) I really liked this movie. The idea of the comic book was very good and the adaption is in my opinion worthy of the book.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
287,Sergeant Hulka,Connery was right.,1,17 July 2003,"I cannot stress enough what an awful movie this is. It wouldn't even be acceptable for a straight-to-video film. I think most people know about the spats that took place between Mr. Connery and director Norrington. I read a magazine article before the film was released that stated that the arguments were mostly about the fact that Connery had to wait for hours in his trailer to shoot scenes that were being postponed while Norrington was ""experimenting."" Several crew members(who were quoted anonymously)stated that Norrington was too ambitious, sacrificing the respect of his cast and crew in order to wow his audience with special effects and complicated camera setups. Most of these, they said, were beyond the reach of a filmmaker of his level of experience and beyond the grasp of any filmmaker. I believe that it is not wise for people outside of the entertainment biz to choose sides in a fight between 2 or more entertainers, because it is always a ""my word against his"" scenario and the truth is only to be had by those who obtained it first hand. After seeing ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" I can say one thing with absolute certainty, however. Connery was right.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

289,rockdude,overblown,4,16 February 2004,"I went into this as a fan of Alan Moore and came out very disappointed. It started well as it brought the characters together and quite cleverly left some background only hinted at. However, once the characters had been assembled and sent out into the world, the pace became far too fast for the plot. The characters bounce from one place to the next with very little explanation and developments are clumsily and obviously introduced. From very early on it is obvious how the film will end (or at least which characters are bad, which ones bond,etc.) and the viewer is left wondering at the end of the film what exactly happened. After I saw this film, I went down the pub with the friends I'd seen the film with and we discussed the film. One guy seemed to understand it much better than us and explained it to us; it later turned out that he'd slept through most of the film, missing most of the action and only just catching the end.The action is certainly watchable and the characters are interesting with some good performances which are massively let down by the speed of the plot and the unworthy script. One can't help but feel that this is another good idea for a film ruined by the Hollywood technique of sacrificing script for action - with more time and some care, the film could have been excellent.

290,witheld,"Great, brilliant, film!!",10,28 July 2003,"**spoilers**Ignore the other posters.  This was a great movie, head and shoulders above all other action fare for the summer.First, the most surprising angle, at least for me.  When was the last time you saw a movie with an attractive woman and the sex angle wasn't played up?/she kept her clothes on?  Mina Harker is important as a character, not as a sexpot.  Points to the director.The same actually extends to other characters.  They are people, rather than just cutouts used to further the plot (with the exception of the invisible man--but, then, they cut his role because to expand it might have meant following Alan Moore closely and making him a rapist--a move that they just weren't quite ready to go for in a PG13 movie, apparently). Hyde is genuinely creepy.  Nemo is authentic.  Far more authentic than any other movie adaptation of 10,00 Leagues Under the Sea.  Dorian Gray is terrifically portrayed (although the whole 'face the painting' non-continuity really was poor; why not just have her stab the painting?)But, bottom line: all the characters were true to the books.  The dialogue wasn't forced, nothing was forced down your throat.  Some people complained that the plot was 'hard to follow;' do these same people complain when an action film beats you over the head with its plot?  Finally a director who understands subtlety and how to lead a plot so it comes out naturally, and they complain!  Bah!And the plot is complex, believe me.  More complex than it appears.  The way it is naturally expanded and the way it flows may fool you into accepting it as simple, even dead; but it is not.  The richness of the deception, the horrible betrayal (which should be obvious to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of the classics from which these characters come)--it all comes together to suddenly make sense.  Suddenly scenes that were strange, scenes that seemed heroic, even the slightly romantic scenes become different.  Creepy.The action is terrific, and the music is haunting.  My only complaint is that the movie was too short.  Another ten minutes establishing M, another ten minutes of interaction between these complex and rich characters...alas.My only hope is a bevy of sequels.  Characters and universe's this rich and complex deserve sequels.9 out of 10 stars (only because it was too short and they toned down the darkness a little bit for the PG13 audience)",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

295,NoHeadedHershel,I'd be insulted...,3,20 January 2004,"I'd be insulted I wasn't supposed to suspend belief in movies like this.The movie starts off in 1899 with six ""classic"" literary characters joining forces to save the world from the arms race about to be created by the evil ""Phantom"".  To tell much more of the plot would be spoiling it for those who haven't seen it.We start with Sean Connery as Allan Quartermain.  This is a believable character, IMO, as Connery does an aging adventurer quite well. Then we have Mina Harker who, in this version of her character, is still a vampire.  We also have Captain Nemo, who must be a multi-billionaire genius - he's got a submarine with insides that look like the Taj Mahal, and *guided* missiles... all in 1899.We also have the invisible man, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, and Dr. Jekyll (and his famous counterpart, Mr. Hyde).But wait, that's seven!  Tom Sawyer wasn't supposed to be there, he just snuck in somehow.Most great adventure movies, and even B-horror movies that involve historical times at least try to be plausible by fitting in with events that were happening, and not trying to change history.  Indiana Jones is a superb example of how you can include Nazis, even kill Nazis, even meet Hitler, all without changing history.If we believe this movie, half of Venice was blown up and collapsed... caused by a domino effect of destroying one building and having the others follow that is somehow stopped by blowing up one of the buildings before the domino effect reaches it.  If that sounds plausible to you, you might like this movie.Speaking about plausibility, how about a submarine 10 stories tall that pops up off a short pier in England.  I'm sure that small wooden pier had footings 150 feet down, right?  Now take that same gigantic submarine and cruise through the canals in Venice.  Right.I like the idea of joining the literary characters together, but in order to do it they just butchered the finer points of each one.  Mina still a vampire?  Dorian Gray and Mina with an implied history?  It just doesn't wash.  I kept pointing out how implausible and ridiculous things were, to the annoyance of my wife who, by the end of the movie, was pointing out stupid things too.In the end, the movie had two positive things I could say about it: it was a free rental (one of Blockbuster's ""guaranteed in stock"" deals), and it was better than the Hulk (we didn't see Gigli, but I'm guessing it's better than Gigli, too).",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

So you can't watch it twice in the same semester. The acting is good (hats off to Sean Connery), Mr Hyde is quite impressive (although the Van Helsing version of Mr Hyde was far better), Peta Wilson makes a luscious vampire Mina and the Nautilus is an absolute optical miracle.

I didn't watch them until after seeing the movie, but if I had I would have been expecting an action-packed roller coaster ride! No doubt they were made by a company expert in movie trailers. without the lame plot.It has the feel of having been written by a teenager. Not to say that teenagers haven't written some good stuff, but I think it was about as fantastical as a world created by some dude one night in his underwear for dungeons and dragons.That there would be such teamwork (with no promise of serious monetary gain, no less) pushes the boundaries of incredulity farther than I will allow. This was an extraordinarily well-behaved and cooperative (though disorganized) band of criminals. I think the League of Women Voters might have made a more formidable enemy. With no real motivation, they were not only willing but gung ho to do this thing, at all costs. Even Mr. Hyde could be easily sweet-talked into submission.Broken down into its simple elements, there is nothing cunning about the plot. In fact, all I could do was find fault with it. It seems like it would have been easier just to get their samples individually, without assembling them for this pretend mission.No suspense until the second half, but by then I was already wishing it would be over, and I kept wishing that from there on in. In fact, the parts at the end I was really hating.So many things didn't add up. I know it's supposed to be an ""alternate reality"" premise, but things need to at least make sense, or have a plausible explanation.

Allan is persuaded out of retirement in Africa to head up a team of 'extraordinary gentlemen' (yes, I know about Mina, but if she weren't a lady, she certainly couldn't be a gentleman)to stop a super-villain who is planning to start a World War.James Robinson's screenplay successfully walks a line between the characters' literary antecedents and their later comic-book incarnations; the result is reminiscent of the the TV show ""The Avengers"" in its wit and style.

Of course: technology which would have created a sensation in real life passes unremarked by those around it, and a battleship-sized vessel is able to navigate tiny waterways with ease; but this is the comic-book ingredient playing its part. The characters themselves, with the exception of Allan and Tom, are absurdities on legs. Those who have enjoyed both comic books and novels will understand.Visually the film is very satisfying, (think 'Sin City' played by Merchant-Ivory characters), conveying fin-de-siecle decay in Europe, contrasted with the natural beauty of Africa and Asia; the musical score by Trevor Jones does its work unobtrusively and well. The plot twists are there, but not too taxing--this writer had it figured out before the group left London--and good performances are turned in all the way around, with tongues ever-so-slightly in cheek; especially suitable are Naseeruddin Shah as the inscrutable Indian and Peta Wilson as the edgy Mina. Connery has been roundly criticized for his performance, but he is true to the way Rider Haggard wrote Quatermain--the merit of which is very open to separate discussion--and he certainly has nothing to prove to anyone as an actor. He seems to have enjoyed the performance, which also appears to have been the case with the rest of the principals. This writer also appreciated the lack of gratuitous language/sex/gore/political grandstanding which so many movie makers seem compelled to include these days. All in all a great lark.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
304,umainer,Van Helsing's better,3,1 July 2005,"As much as I wanted to like this... as much as I liked the comic that started it... as much as I like the novels the characters came from... it could not help this movie. At 2hrs, it is too long. The CGI effects become too much after awhile (particularly the J&H ones near the end) and some of the actions scenes have so much going on, it is hard to follow all the characters you want to watch.Having seen both ""Van Helsing"" and ""LXG"" recently, I would give the rental nod to VH. More entertaining in the end. I find it interesting the trend continues in Hollywood between competing studios to put out basically the same movie and have some items in each that are nearly identical. Case in point: In both VH and LXG, Mr Hyde's depiction is nearly identical in the Hulk like view of him as well as having him run around Paris when we first see him---in VH as a Quasimodo role and in LXG in a nod to Poe's ""Murder's in the Rue Morgue"".I stayed with it to the end, hoping for it to get better but never got rewarded. Got it on 2 for 1 night so not a total loss.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I selected it as I thought it would appeal to the boys in my life, it did. Aged 44, 13 and 9 they all enjoyed, but, to me, it was a weird mix of historical surroundings, sci-fi, and literary characters. (Although the identity of the American agent as Tom Sawyer was not something I picked up on in film, only realising when I visited this site). The special effects were good (although I wondered about the damaging effect of the ship's wake on Venice), the fight scenes dramatic enough, Dorian Grey, although good-looking, was a tad older than I would have expected , the twist of loyalty obvious. I have feeling that a sequel may be in the offering, if so the boys can go without me!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

You do realize these characters never really existed right? This is a fun movie that doesnt have to have every single plot point explained ad nauseam. Bravo to the filmmakers for not spending 3/4 of the film explaining back history on these characters (NOTE If you are having trouble with this concept...read a book!) This film was ten times the movie that the overhyped Matrix Reloaded and the god awful Hulk was....oh and by the way; Mister Hyde was a much better Hulk than the Hulk was as well.

307,Karpy9,Heavy on Hollywood effects but all in all entertaining,7,11 July 2003,"LXG was entertaining but was a bit too much of Hollywood action, the first appearing of Allen Quartermain (Connery) we see him kill 4-5 men as they all miss killing with machine guns and Connery dives headfirst over a table, his punches in the movie were sensational, Indiana Jones bashes so to speak and was tough as nails in an action mode, he was ""quite the naughty scotty,"" Sean Connery is 73 years young. Yes he carried the movie but he was the Exec. Producer on the film, he gave the people what they wanted, entertainment and action but hollywood style, hard too understand, a bit, a few causes without effects and effects without causes, unfortunate the critics bashed it, I give it 2 and a half stars.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

With all the other interesting charicters I had no use for him. In the end I wanted more of them and less of Connery.

I have one question will the Quartermain live on our is the spirit of him alive through the US agent? We will have to wait to see what the League will do next but be aware that these stars will have much to come from this roll and that these actors and actress are the next generation of Adventure/action/scifi crime fighting. Overall this was a Extraordinary film and it is a film you cannot miss.Other Movies I would reccomend:Pirates of the Carribean, How to Deal, Leagally Blond 2, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship,Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and How to Lose a Guy in 10 DaysMovies I would not  reccomend:The Hulk",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Some complain the ""historical"" characters aren't in keeping with their original source...blah blah blah...why shouldn't Dorian Gray be invincible??? Why shouldn't Dr Jekyll's Mr Hyde be a huge computer-generated monster??The only downside is that the characters won't get the sequel they deserve. X-Men 2 was much better because it didn't have to spend most of the film introducing characters etc etc - LXG 2 would benefit from the same scenarioI enjoyed it - but then I wasn't expecting much from it.If you're gonna take it seriously I suggest you watch something else instead.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
311,boldentommy,Sad sad little film,3,12 November 2012,"Well here I am once again in the video store with my wife, we are just walking through the racks trying to figure out what it is that we want to watch. I have already made my selections and she has done the same, until she runs across this little picture. The league of extraordinary gentleman. Now to be fair I had heard of the title but being a fan of Allen Moore I decided to stay away, mainly because the adaptations of his writings are poor. Now I had heard that this movie was terrible and i should have listened but like a fly attracted to horse dung i found myself wanting to watch it.I think the main reason is because Sean Connery was in the movie. Now what made the comic strip so great was the unique characters and the strange settings. Now what did the film use of these things........nothing. I cant really think of any good points accept that the action isn't really that bad. The director and story writer really just thrown away what made the comic great. Well lets dissect this hunk of garbage. The characters, there are too many there is no room for them to develop, a smaller cast would have been great for this movie. Each person in the movie got about three Min's of screen time per frame. Now the action its OK at best but it seemed a little rushed, what Connery could have added would have been a James bond style of movie with pacing and good story telling. But instead (this is best example) we have at one point in the film a car driving down the streets of Venice trying to cause an explosion to stop an explosion. I seriously felt overwhelmed but the film. You never know which direction its heading is it serious is it funny is it an action comedy. Now the cgi is next. Some of the special effects i thought were good then we get to finally battle and oh boy the crap hit the fan. So I wouldn't waste my time with this movie not unless you need a laugh.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I can say that i did not care for the plot, actually there was hardly a plot worth discussing, but i still enjoyed the movie. Why? I liked the assembly of Odd combination characters and the cgi. This alone is what drove my brain to sit through 2 hours of a meaningless plot. That alone permit me to forgive Nemo's ship for sailing the tiny canals of Venice, Car chases and rocket launchers during the late 1800s. Tom Sawyer? What? This movie is not for people who read the novels. I laugh at everyone who was ""suprised"" Hollywood screwed up another adapted concept. Did you people not watch X-men? It's a visual movie. From the staggeringly awesome, razor-thin Nautilus to those large man-beasts duking it out in the alleys of Venice, it was just enjoyable to watch.

313,bound-to-sanzo,A Good watch,8,11 June 2005,"I thought this film was very good, I don't see why everyone doesn't like it?! The film is based upon the hit book, and that is a brilliant book-a bit dated, but readable. Sean Connery played Allen Quatermain very well, and stuck to the book very closely, so I could picture him doing the things, while I read it. I love how all the characters derive from best-seller books around the Victorian period - that's why the film is set in that era!All of the characters and the special effects were very well done, in so doing: a great film to watch every so often. I loved how they did Dr. Jeckle turning into Mr. Hyde, it's truly fascinating; and Dorian Grey's picture, fabulous!If you liked the film, you must read the book, or the other way round. In the book there are a number of other events that took place that didn't appear in the film, trust me, it's a good read.My favourite character must be Skinner-the invisable man. Tony Curran does him so well, and the the special effects on him, make him seem almost real. A fabulous story, brilliant characters, a wonderful watch!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
314,batocicero,Why is it hated so?,7,16 November 2009,"I see no reason why this film is so hated around the movie fan community. It's certainly not the best of the best, but it's entertaining, and has some nice moments. I also liked the idea of putting fictional novel characters together in an alternate 19th century England. The characters weren't certainly developed much, but either way they are already well known, all they had to do is giving them a reason to join the League. And the general moody environment fits the story well.Pros: a) Fast-paced flick with lots of action b) Cool, well-known characters c) Good chemistry of the group members d) A couple story twists (maybe predictable, but enjoyable) e) Some amazing effects (the Venice sequence is probably the most visually impressive)Cons: a) A few over-the-top moments b) A few bad special effects (the most salient being the ""bad day"" Dr. Jekyll rip-off at the final battle) c) Some plot holes d) Perhaps they could have made Quatermain a bit more likableAll in all, not a horrible movie. Could have been corrected. 7/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

So I believe this movie is a well entertaining, well worth seeing heroic action at all.. So for the others who are jabbering about the movie, I think they do not got anything to do much, shitting on movie by their mouths.. Anyway, this movie can be better, specially with the story. Story is killing itself just in the middle of the movie, so you got nothing else to watch, expected action sequences. No surprise, no thriller. Just see our guys, beating-fighting the enemy at the second half... Even these are not bothering me, cause I was not expecting much more than an action movie. So you do that, and have some nice time with Lxg....By the way, I think movie is a bit low rated. It deserves a 6,5 but not a 7...I voted it 10 just to normalize a little...hehhe",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
316,timskelly,"Moore, biggerfasterlouder",7,12 July 2003,"Other than character names (and not all of those) this film's story has nothing at all to do with Allen Moore's graphic novel. But that's not a bad thing. Both visually and in terms of invention, literally and literary, the film comes quite close to holding its own with the comic book it was based on.The trailers for this film don't even *begin* to show how much is crammed into the movie, including two additional characters. The visuals are even more mind blowing and gargantuan than those depicted by Kevin O'Neill in the original graphic novel, and that is very hard to imagine. Facing an even greater challenge, screenwriter James Robinson managed to spin a marvelous original plotline, even if his characterizations are a bit below par. It was ballsy to keep the concept and completely re-write the story. But, after all, most of the fun of the comic book original is its rewritten history of fictional characters.Given the above, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is crammed to the gills with artifice and action. At a more relaxed pace, it could easily have taken two motion pictures to present in full. But we do not live in a relaxed age, neither the 19th nor 20th century, as the film's opening moment clearly reminds us. This is a 21st century film for a 21st century audience. For better or worse, this audience craves morebiggerfasterlouder, just as it might have 100 years ago. Today just happens to be 100 years of morebiggerfasterlouder later.The film is about a time of radical change, the acceleration of change, and the fears that change conjures in the human mind. Ironically, Executive Producer and star Sean Connery (who has had some rather unkind words for the film's director) seems to share that vision. But his role in this film, on and off screen, is that of a man looking into the past, looking towards the end of things, not their beginning. Perhaps that is why in Moore's version, Connery's character, Allen Quatermain, is not the leader but the led.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
317,FMK,Forgettable and Messy,3,2 May 2004,"Though I would prefer to write a more extensive review of this bad, bad movie, it has made so little impression on me that even now, five minutes after the dvd ended, I remember hardly anything about it. Except, of course, how bad it is. Admittedly, they started out with a terrible script, and that can't have helped. But the acting is unconvincing and flat without exception (and it pains me to say that, because I love both Wilson and Connery). The storyline swerves and buckles thanks to a silly and senseless plot. The effects hardly rise above video gaming level, with the shots of underwater Venice as the sad low. But it is in continuity and editing that the real crimes have been committed upon this film. For continuity there is the - surprisingly brief - Goofs section of this page, but the editing deserves special mention. What were they thinking in the cutting room? How about rhythm, smoothness, visual continuity, or at least sequences that make sense, any kind of sense at all? All in all, a film that deserves to be forgotten. I'm almost there already.

The 19th century British Secret Service call upon Alan Quartermain(King Solemon's Mines) to assemble a team of extraordinary gentlemen, all of which are literary characters.The movie has explosions, a few cool effects, and quite a bit of plot left in the typewriter.I would, however, recommend reading the Graphic Novel first.

Now I have never read the Graphic Novel so I am unable to draw comparisons, but the film version was terrific.The cast delivered fine performances, especially Connery. For a 73 year old he can still trade punches with the best of them. The character of Allan Quartermain was perfect and Connery sold the performance at every turn. Mina Harker, Dr Jeckyl, Captain Nemo and Dorian Gray were all essayed note perfect by their respective actors. I could not fault the casting.The special effects were great and gave the film a real Jules Verne atmosphere. The effects work for Mr Hyde was awesome and the makers of The Hulk should hang their heads in shame by comparison.Now the film was criticised for character dialogue and plot, are they kidding? The script works fine and delivers some genuine thrills and plot twists.Considering this film was written off as a train wreck prior to release due in no small part to the turmoil reported on set, it is amazing how well it turned out.

327,Bennett000,Sean Connery Strikes Again,1,25 August 2003,"I really wanted to see this movie.  My expectations were that it would be horrible.  Quite horrible.  I saw the movie about two months after its theatrical debut.  I cannot express how much I wanted this movie to be good. Great comic series, great premise, perhaps the worst execution of anything since Ishtar.This film was so poorly done that no one in the theater had any qualms about loudly making fun of the film.  There was no level that this movie was enjoyable on.  It was so horrible that it even defied mockery!  I think there were only three instances where I laughed.  This is definitely one of the worst movies of all time.  It's almost as silly as Speed 2: Cruise Control.  Many might say to give it a chance, and that it's not supposed to be realistic.  Well I not only gave it a chance, I went in knowing it was pure fantasy, the historical inaccuracies are only a mild annoyance, its just the overall poorness that gets really annoying.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Here is a list of things the movie did well:1. Dorian Gray is a pretty cool character. 2. Sean Connery has a cool accent. 3. The setting and scenes are really well done aside from the submarine. 4. The roadster is pretty cool.Here is why this movie is so poor.  This entirely excludes historical inaccuracies as this movie is an attempt at fantasy.1. Submarine changes sizes and magically fits into a Venetian canal!! 2. Submarine is solar powered! 3. Submarine's internal design ignores basic rules of physics.  Come on, the submarine has cavernous rooms that are lavishly decorated.  There is even a scene where the sub gets wrecked and to fix it the men merely righted the tables.  Submarines need to be structurally sound!! They're under immense pressure all the time. 4. The CGI of the submarine is laughable.  LAUGHABLE!  But not as laughable as Matrix: Reloaded. 5. The scenes were directed in the campiest of fashions.  Not a good quality campy either.  The actors were all trying to be serious and most of them didn't have enough charm to pull off the camp.  Dorian Gray did a great job though and the invisible man was alright. 6. Sean Connery is amazing; but he's too old to beat people up the way he does in this film.  There are a few scenes which actually make him look really good; but there are so many where it's just far too implausible. None of his fight scenes are as cool as the bar seen from The Presidio. 7. The villain is so weak.  Good superhero movies depend on the villain quality.  Superman/Lex Luthor, Superman/Three Kryptonians, Spiderman/Green Goblin, Bond/Goldfinger, Indiana Jones/Nazis etc.  The villain in LXG is a cross between the Phantom of the Opera and GI Joe's Destro!  He is an arm s dealer with a metal mask who thinks he's some sort of operatic character. There is even a part where he could easily have eluded Connery; but returned for his foolish looking mask!!!  He is the most pathetic villain I've ever seen.  I basically felt sorry for the actor the entire time.8. The action was ridiculous.  Superhero movies are generally cool because the director builds up to the action.  This movie was action non-stop. Instead of having useless fight scenes it would have been a lot smarter for them to develop the characters a little.  It was quite funny because the director expects us to know the characters from nineteenth century literature; BUT changes their personalities and timelines such that we don't really know them.  Dorian Gray was so cool though. 9. The ending scene where `Africa won't let Quartermain die' is perhaps the worst scene in cinematic history!!!!The list goes on and on seemingly to infinity.  I was so bored during this movie I almost cried.  This movie made me feel depressed for the next six hours it was so bad.  It was horrible.Please unless your IQ is less than seventy for the love of yourself do not see this movie.  Trust me on this one.

Why?Two reasons: I'd read the graphic novel, and my IQ is over 73.Just seconds into the film I was already shaking my head. Both in small details and large, they'd managed to completely botch the job. Painful dialog. Embarrassing special effects. Incredibly annoying characters. A script obviously written with dull-witted seven-year-old boys in mind.I'm trying to envision the Hollywood idiots who sat around a conference table and destroyed Alan Moore's witty and intelligent graphic novel. But then I cringe, because by all accounts Sean Connery was one of them. He must be quite a bit dumber than I had hoped.I can't remember which scene first made me say ""Good lord, that's even worse than I dreamed possible!"", but I know I said it more than once.Oh, and ""Venice"". I've been to Venice, and Senator, that's no Venice. The one thing EVERYONE in the world knows is that Venice has no streets, only canals! So what do they do? Have a car racing all over huge, completely non-existent streets in Venice. Why? What were they thinking?So many other things to insult the viewer. A ""graveyard"" in Venice. The enormous Nautilus cruising easily though canals that in the real world aren't 1/100th wide or deep enough to fit it. I can't go on.

331,jswraven,A Great Concept that Fizzles,5,12 July 2003,"I was not familiar with the ""graphic novel"" that League is based upon, but I did find the concept rather intriguing.  Victorian Era literary characters thrown together in an adventurous industrial dawn.  Nice.The movie gives a fine introduction to the concept.  I was interested for the first fifteen minutes or so.  I like adventure--and we haven't seen Alan Quartermain since Richard Chamberlain's closet 80's. But, a great idea with a decent story-premise cannot be held together entirely by Sean Connery's name and Peta Wilson's looks.  The effects are obviously digital, and not often well done--digital fire that looks like digital fire is unimpressive.  The plot takes an expected and pointless turn, then wanders off into drivel.  Even half-way through the movie I figured that I could just watch it for adventure's sake and not think too hard about what was going on... wrong.   After all the characters make their introductions, we get the cookie-cutter moments of doubt and self-demons (onboard The Nautilus), before we again wander into drivel.  While I do not expect ""character development"" in an action/adventure/fantasy movie, I would expect some consistency--I'm thinking specifically of ""Mr. Hyde.""  For a let-down summer movie, I would normally recommend a ""wait for the video/DVD.""  However, I think the shortcomings of the digital effects will be more apparent on home entertainment centers.Disappointing.  I cannot give it higher than a 5.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
332,keenan-1,"Heavens, it wasn't THAT bad!",7,17 May 2004,"I've been reading the comments page in a somewhat bemused fashion.  It seems to be divided between people who don't like the movie because it's not enough like the original graphic novel and people who don't like it because they've never heard of half of the characters that are members of the League.  The latter seems to me to be an unutterably silly reason for disliking a film.  Does nobody read the classics anymore?  Nobody reads Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  I find that difficult to believe.  As to the former--not enough like the graphic novel, in other words--just how in the heck can a screenwriter accommodate the dark and twisted visions of Alan Moore in a two-hour Hollywood movie, anyway?     I don't believe that one can compare anything written by Alan Moore to what ends up on the screen being ostensibly ""based on the graphic novel"". (The same applies to FROM HELL, which is another one most people pan, and one which I think is under-appreciated even though the style is breathtaking.  I don't even want to think about the reaction that will ensue once THE WATCHMEN comes out!)       What seems to have been missed by most people is that this movie is about style as opposed to substance.  It's based on a graphic novel.  That's a fancy way of saying it's based on a comic book.  On that level, the film succeeds admirably.  The characters are archetypes of their literary forbears.  They aren't supposed to be, strictly speaking, human.  Of course the plot is grandiose, impractical, and over-the-top.  Hello?  Aren't most comic books like that?  Good heavens, isn't most of STAR WARS?     I don't claim that this is a masterpiece.  I do claim that's it's fun to watch if one approaches it with a willing suspension of disbelief.  For a couple of bucks shelled out at the DVD rental shop, it takes one to a different world for close to two hours.  On that level, it's worth a rental. It's also worth a rental, once one watches the movie, to listen to the commentary from various actors and to realize just how well these so-called ""unknowns"" do assorted accents that aren't even close to their own.  Plus the golfing anecdotes are amusing.  (And I don't even like golfing.)     This ain't CASABLANCA.  Nor is it TITANIC, for which I eternally thank the gods.  (Now, THERE was an overhyped piece of inaccurate trash that pretended to be history, but I digress.)  But it's kind of fun, anyway, as long as one doesn't take it too seriously.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

For me, it's the best movie i have seen this year, a tie with X-Men 2. Yeah, Matrix Reloaded rocks, but I liked The League better. I know that The Lord of the Rings: The Return of The King and Matrix Revolutions are just ahead, and I know they will rock, but The League will remain forever in my list of favorites. Solid non-stop action, no boring scenes. In one word, perfect. I am a H-U-G-E- anime, manga and comics fan, and I didn't feel disappointed by this movie. The comic book idea is the same, and it's just great, as the graphic novel was. Nothing can change my mind, i give this one a solid 10 out of 10. Awesome.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Every character comes in ""ready to go"" and the relations between the characters aren't really solved.But it makes fun to view all the CGIs and effects and following the ""plot"" from one cliffhanger to the next one.Unfortunately the German synchro voice of Nemo is very close to the German voice of Bruce Willis in the ""Die Hard"" trilogy.

I admit, I viewed it just to see Sean Connery, hoping he would make it better than the critics had said, but it was truly one of his most disappointing roles.  (I wonder if he was disappointed in the result, after having produced it.)  The plot is quite thin, with many holes, and there are fights every few minutes--not very interesting fights--just fights, and I thought it was one of the most boring action-adventure flicks I have seen.  A previous comment that Mr. Hyde looks like the Incredible Hulk was right on--how weird.  I'm glad some found this entertaining, but I just found it boring!

Even though I hadn't expected much, my worst fears were confirmed the moment Captain Nemo started spinning around doing Karate moves. Oh my gosh, I thought to myself, is this ever bad. It only got worse and eventually I found myself laughing...not because the movie was any good but that someone in the industry actually had the audacity to put out something this bad. Not only that, but were expecting to milk a sequel out of this Turkey as well! Careers end over such train wrecks, and to think, Connery quit his Bond gig to do stuff like this? Who the heck at this studio has the job of filtering out bad scripts? Sirens should have been going off in their heads when they read the lines ""And now masked henchmen burst into the library and Captain Nemo starts spinning around doing Judo chops on the villains."" Somebody had to have gotten fired for approving MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to waste on such a dreadful concept.

The whole idea behind it was fascinating and gives them so much scope for a whole series of leagues from varying points throughout history. the effects on Skinner are breathtaking and the CGI for MR Hyde was awesome. not sure what the rating for this film is but i bet my 10 year old daughter and 8 year old nephew would love it.,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
338,kobus666,"Loud, confusing, CGI trainwreck",6,27 September 2003,"I've always admired the kinetic artwork of comic book artist Kevin O'Neill, and the marriage of his artistry with the writings of Alan Moore produced a wonderful graphic novel. The stylish victorian steampunk fantasy setting combined with impeccable research, attention to detail made it a compelling read. What made the book stand out in particular was the strong, and interesting characters and sharp witty writing. The movie fails spectacularly because it has none of these qualities.Moore's comic book version of the heroes were obvious and unapologetic derivatives from established classic fiction, a hodgepodge of fantasy brought together in the mother of all steam fantasy crossovers. Putting together the likes of Captain Nemo and Allan Quatermain, Hyde/Jekyll, the Invisible Man, and more such well-established classical characters would have been an emberrassing fan-fic in the hands of any but the most talented writer. More than a revival or self-serving fantasy, the comic book is a homage to these cherished works of classical fantasy. The movie fails spectacularly because it has none of these qualities.There's just nothing much good to say about the movie, which is utterly average and unspectacular no matter how you look at it. The sound mix is probably the best thing about it, and even that is just average, nothing special.The camera work is sloppy and uninspired, the fight scenes are so badly choreographed and overcut that the action becomes a stroboscopic string of meaningless flashes. The set designs are dull and silly in most places.
Nemo's Nautilus is a quarter-mile long thing with designs in gleaming silver and decorative statues and other such meaningless features bolted on. Suspension of disbelief fails here, it just looks like a very obvious, under-realized and badly designed CGI fluff piece. The Nautilus of Disney's classic technicolor adaptation (and that of Kevin O'Neill's comic book version) were both much more interesting and inspired.The whole Venice subplot was plain dumb, that's about the nicest way I can put it. The car chase was completely out of place, and with the gun fights and  all the explosions and CGI everything it just felt like any other action movie, pre-digested for audiences with very short attention spans - who would not have read the comic book before, and almost certainly would not want to pick it up after seeing this trainwreck of a dull and very unmemorable movie.Oh, if one has to end a review on a positive note, the Mina character was pretty much spot on.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Little funny scenes like putting on the glasses to shoot the bad guy would resonate with people over 40, but would not be visceral for a younger audience.  Also, the Nautilus' first mate's self-introduction was hilarious to our family, but a less broadly educated crowd might miss the humor.I enjoyed the movie very much.

I've read the Jules Verne's books of Captain Nemo and his adventures. I've also read the novel about Dorian Grey and his extraordinary portrait. But this mixture of them added with some elements of Dracula, Jekyll&Hyde and Tom Sawyer is absolutely unique. Although its not rated as a comedy, in my opinion its the best comedy I've ever seen. One somewhat disturbing element was the main character Mr. Quatermine. I must admit that I could not link him to any story I've read or heard.

And neither have disappointed me. The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen sizzled with onscreen chemistry. All the characters just sort of worked. The dialogue was wonderful. A better Agent Sawyer (Shane West) couldn't have been found. As the egotistical, painfully vain Dorian Gray, Stuart Townsend was perfectly evil. Sean Connery as Quartermain was inspired. No one could have played Quartermain with that air of dignified defiance as Connery did. Bravo to Norrington for his efforts in bringing not only comic book but classic characters to life and making then lovable. You can actually care about these characters. You fear for their safety. You want to applaud their victories. In summation, The critics are indeed, and once again, wrong.

344,quinlan_vos,"I read The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and this film definitely ain't League of Extraordinary Gentlemen",3,16 December 2003,"The ""hip"" title of LXG (which has the stink of a marketing department all over it) is definitely more appropriate than the title League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the comics upon which this movie (I hesitate to call this a film) was supposedly based.  This movie was definitely a slap in the face to the fans of Alan Moore, as it took a brilliantly simple concept (a Victorian Era Avengers) and completely botched it in favor of 'splosions and flashy effects.  We can thank Sean Connery in part for the mess that was LXG, as he pretty much took over the editing process in order to make the character of Alan Quartermain (sp) take center stage in what SHOULD have been an exciting ensemble piece.  This film definitely ranks as one of the worst movies of the year, and one of the worst comic book adaptations of all time (beating out Hulk for the top spot, but not by much...of course, that's a whole other rant entirely).",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
345,cheshirekat003,It's Bad,4,15 July 2003,"*Watch out for spoilers* Dear Lord, this movie was heinous. I can't even begin to talk about the ridiculousness of this entire film. First, some old man (Connery) is asked to defend England against world war with a rag-tag team of people with creepy powers/abilities. So, the team is formed: a female scientist/vampire, Dorian Gray, an invisible man who likes to call people ""freaky darlings"", a turban wearing crazy-bearded Captain Nemo, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, and of course, Shane West. Sounds silly? Yeah, it was. So anywho, this mosh of ""extraordinary gentlemen"" go to Venice and try to stop the mysterious Phantom from starting a world war. Then there are some storm troopers. Then Robo-Cop shows up. I kid you not. And then it turns out that the Phantom is actually the guy who hired them in the first place. Really, it makes no sense. In this movie, Shane West is totally Sean Connery's bitch (can I say that?) I feel bad for Shane West, I really do. He is a really good actor who probably took this job because it meant that he got to work with Sean Connery. But really, it was not the greatest move. And it's not his fault. The material that they gave him to work with was BAD. The only other person who was good in this movie was Stuart Townsend as Dorian Gray. He was fabulous, and also a little *fabulous*. He did a really good job with the crap lines he was given to say. He is very Johny Depp-esque, and I admire that. The only good part of the entire movie was when Sean Connery said something to Shane West and Shane West responded, ""Whatever it takes."" And, of course this is hilarious to all Shane West fans because his first starring movie role was in.... ""Whatever it Takes."" Ha! Well, it at least had me rolling in the aisles. The rest of the time I was rolling in the aisle because of the ridiculousness of it all. They left the movie semi-open ended, my guess was, in hopes of a sequel. But, I beg of you, don't go there. There are only 3 reasons why anyone should go see this movie: 1) you are a huge Shane West fan (me!), 2) you are a huge Stuart Townsend fan, or 3) you want to have a really good laugh and mock Sean Connery, which I think is an excellent reason. Woohoo for Shane West!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
346,leyenda61,Saturday Matinee the LXG way.,6,11 July 2003,"Well, I just came out of the theater after having viewed LXG.  First off, I do not think it was a bad movie. While i would not recommend it as a must see movie, I certainly didn't find it to be a waste of my time. Sure, some plot points could have been developed more/better, but hey, I didn't walk in expecting Shakespeare.  Though I haven't read the graphic novel on which the film is based, I have read that both the graphic novel and the movie take place in a reality alternate from both out history and our literary canons; which means that even though Stoker never wrote Mina as turning into a vampire, it's okay for LXG to take the license to do so. And so on and so forth.Yes, it would have been nice to see Connery make his character a little more swashbuckling. But maybe that was the writing.  I almost loathe watching anything with Peta Wilson, but i found here surprisingly interesting in this movie.  In fact, other than Tom Sawyer's character seeming a bit incomprehensible, I think the other Leaguers were pretty interesting.  But what was the deal with the bad guy, ""M""? I thought his M.O. was even more pointless and less fleshed-out out than any of the flattest Bond villains I've had the displeasure of seeing.  It was just a badly written character.
Just a word or two about the Mr. Hyde F/X, the CGI wizards of the Hulk could take a clue. Sure, both characters were CGI rendered, but Mr. Hyde's size carried a credible degree of mass and weight, whereas the Hulk often moved as if mass-less, making him seem too two dimensional.All in all, I give the movie a respectable 6/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

The basic idea of putting together legendary characters such as Dorian Gray and Alan Quatermain along with Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde and the Invisible Man is ingenious in itself, but it could have all turned out so wrong. Thankfully the inspirational casting of Sean Connery as Quatermain and Tony Curran as The Invisible Man, head a wonderful line up. The story line works well, keeping you engrossed and not just relying on fancy special effects to keep the film going, though there are many excellent ones. From the opening scene to the last moments you are taken to a world of legends and a time of mysteries. There are some scenes, like when they get into a car in the  middle of a busy Victorian street and nobody takes any notice that have to be forgiven, but this is not realism its pure entertainment.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
348,Rhife,Flawed comic-book movie is still good if you don't expect too much.,10,12 July 2003,"Billed as ""X-Men meets Literature"", LXG is in good hands. Director Stephen Norrington (Blade) has assembled quite the cast, led by Sean Connery, who is still believable as an action star, even in his early 70's. As far as the rest of the cast goes, performances are good to okay. Shane West as Agent Thomas Sawyer feels unnatural, as he was just thrown in to appease American audiences. Peta Wilson is sexy and leathal as Mina Harker, Dracula's ""bride."" Townsend brings a dark, yet likable personality to Grey, Shah is great as the ninja-like Captain Nemo, Curran provides funny moments as the invisible man, and Flemyng is great as the tortured Jekyel/Hyde.
The action is great. Probably the best part of the film. Especially the final act, which contains some great fight/shooting sequences. The opening is also pretty cool. The movie does drag its feet for the first 40 minutes, but then kicks into high gear and doesn't really let off. Some twists are rather predictable, but it is forgivable for providing great showdowns later on. Mr. Hyde looks great,  and will no doubt be comparred to ""Hulk"" as far as CGI goes, although he looks more real then the Hulk did. Infact, the special effects as a whole are really, really good. Watch the Venice sequence and you'll see what I mean.For the bad stuff. The dialogue was awfully hokey at times, although not enough to bring the film down. Still, a lot of lines feel forced and out of place. I wasn't extremely pleased with the ending-ending, but it works and isn't a bad ending, just not as good as I would've hoped. Some parts are a little slow as well. And any twists that happened were predictable for the most part.Overall, it is definately worth seeing after a slew of dissapointing movies so far this summer. However, if you have to choose between this and ""Pirates"", go with the latter, as it provides more fun overall. I DO reccommend seeing LXG, especially if you're a comic book fan (especially X-Men.)

360,Liljan-2,"Promising idea, disappointing result",2,9 November 2003,"Possible spoilers within.When I went to see 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', I was hoping to see an adventure movie of the old kind, one that does not necessarily depend on explosions every five minutes in order to be exciting  maybe something comparable to the early Indiana Jones movies. The general idea of the movie is to let some classic characters from British and American 19th century literature, such as Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde and Dorian Gray  join together to fight international criminals who attempt to provoke a devastating global war. Another reason why I wanted to see the movie is the fact that Sean Connery, one of my favourite actors, has a leading part. All this sounds potentially interesting, but by and large 'The League' was a disappointing experience for me.To me, it seems that the entertainment value of this kind of movie relies to a large extent on the element of surprise. And there are plenty of surprises as the different characters with their various qualities are introduced at the beginning of the movie. But once this stage has been surpassed, the movie starts to drag. We do not gain any deeper insight into the personalities of the characters; they remain stereotypes throughout  Allan Quatermain is the tough and hardy African explorer, Captain Nemo has a big and impressive submarine, Mina Harker is a vampire who bites bandits whenever the opportunity arises, Dorian Gray is immortal etc. 'The League' quickly turns into another average action movie with plenty of loud bangs and little substance.The settings, including Victorian London, Paris and Venice, could have been a lot more suggestive than they are being made to appear. The depiction of Dr. Jekyll's alter ego is also disappointing in my opinion. He looks like a flesh-coloured version of the Hulk  this is just as unimaginative as it is unfrightening. The character Tom Sawyer appears rather anonymous in comparison with his illustrious compatriots in the league, having no particular qualities except a Winchester rifle and an American accent. The reason for this could be the fact that he was merely added because the studio feared that the movie would receive a cold reception from the American audience unless an American character and cast member was included.Two out of ten in my opinion.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

However, I only previously knew the characters from their original (and far more culturally significant) appearances in classic fiction, not from their appearance in a comic book obscure to all but young Anglo-Americans. Perhaps someone who hasn't read the classics but who has read the comic book would feel otherwise.The biggest problem with the movie is that the action is so predictable that the viewer doesn't need a script to know what happens next. I hope the writers received a sizable discount at Big George's House o' Action Movie Clichés - they certainly added them by the truckload, and the director did not have the deft touch to work them in. On the other hand, the acting is solid (especially Connery, who is fantastic no matter what he does) and the cinematography and set design are both great. There are a few misfires in the special effects, but otherwise the movie is visually appealing.But I can't get past how the characters were mangled and how ham-handedly the action is telegraphed, and because of that I can't recommend this movie for anyone but the most dedicated comic book fanboy. It really is that bad.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
363,Ten98,So bad it's almost good... Almost.,1,30 September 2003,"Everything about this movie is wrong. Even Sir Sean Connery fails to bring to life one of the most diseased and rotting corpses of a movie I've had the misfortune to watch.First of all, this movie is totally dependant on special effects, for the mostpart CGI. The one good use of CGI in the film is when the invisible man is putting on or taking off his face paint, those scenes alone are almost worth sitting through the rest of this garbage. The rest of the CGI looks plain bad. It's obvious where the joins are, and Mr Hyde especially looks like something Pixar knocked up in their lunch break.I don't have the time nor the inclination to go into every single thing that stunk about this movie, so I'll just list the ones that annoyed me the most.The ship. What on earth was it? A super fast submarine boat powered by nuclear steam? And it had some kind of pre-industrial radar. I've never seen anything so ridiculous. And while we're on the subject of anachronisms, the 6-wheeled car was also very stupid. Just where does one get 300 gallons of petrol (that means gas) to fuel it?Tom ""CIA Special Ops"" Sawyer. There was no earthly reason for this person to be in the movie other than to serve as a nice hero type character for American males to look up to. His only superpower was being American, unlike the rest of the team. He gave the distinct impression of only being there to make up the numbers.Everyone gets to use their powers once to save the day, it became so predictable and tiresome I started making up what would happen next in my head while I was watching it, and the sad thing is, that was better than the actual film.Why is it that when someone is invisible, they can't seem to do anything without either carrying an object, banging into something, knocking something over or making something move...Everyone in the League hates each other for no apparent reason.It's called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but there's a woman in it. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for female empowerment and everything, but adding one token woman just for the sake of it is just pathetic.Nobody can aim their guns, except when firing at inanimate objects, then they can hit a tin can floating on the sea from a mile away.Nobody can throw a punch, they hit each other twenty or thirty times and never get bruised or cut.The Invisible man talks like an extra from Mary Poppins.Eventually they stopped making up excuses to have action scenes and just started throwing them together one after the other, until the end which has a slight twist, but by that time you really don't care any more and just want it to be over.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
364,agentmaxsmart,Extraordinary!,10,13 December 2003,"WOW! I just got the DVD & watched this film. I was totally blown away. Non-stop action, great characters, fantastic special effects.

What a breath of fresh air in a sea of boring ""action"" fantasy films that I've been forced to watch lately. Nothing even comes close, this is a perfect 10.

365,admather,So awful its criminal...,1,21 October 2003,"I don't think the armrests in my local multiplex will ever be the same again after I practically ripped them to shreds whilst watching this pish. I'd read bad reviews, heard the rumours and dismissed the warnings of my peers - deciding to go and see it for myself before passing judgement. I wish to God I hadn't. Connery hasn't made a decent film for over a decade, yet he still believes that at 107 he can still be a Bond-style, suave, action star. In the League..., his quips and one liners clunk to the floor like a third-rate Austin Powers whilst he stumbles around the screen with his ego over-blowing the rest of the production. His companions are one-dimensional eccentrics, complete with appalling CGI to take away any credibility they may have actually possessed in the first place (Titanic-sized Nautilus sweeping through narrow Venician canals? Dorien Gray's final demise that actually makes ILM's 'Mummy Returns' ending look convincing.) It's not even as if you can gain any perverse pleasure at seeing how bad this film actually is. Far from the dark subtlety of the graphic novel it's based on, it just seems to follow the standard action-quip-action-quip-action of Terminator 3 or Armageddon. It's a sorry state of affairs for any movie when Richard Roxburgh turns out to be the best thing about it. It's just terrible. How on Earth Terry Gilliam's Baron Munchausen (which had a better script/effects/actors etc...) could have flopped when this piece of trash looks set to bank some serious box office cash is beyond belief. Don't watch the League. Ever. Not even if you want to giggle at how atrocious it is. You'd be better off renting Sewage Baby.BTW, anyone who uses the arguments ""it's set in an alternate universe"" or ""it's fantasy - it doesn't have to be realistic"" to try and justify the Venice scenes should be shot. Could you imagine if Peter Jackson had made his King Kong actually eat the Empire State Building and then used that to explain why. He'd have been laughed out of Hollywood. Thus, the Nautilus cruising the Venetian canals is also ridiculous.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
366,imdb2003,Is there a good word to be said?,1,30 November 2013,"No. There really isn't.Moreso than most, the plot based on Moore's story is a horrible mashup of different story mythologies, and chains disjointed set pieces which make no sense in their own right let alone within the context of the whole, and full of fundamental holes. The technological anachronisms jar - an automobile that with an engine with contemporary grunt at a time when Benz had only just perfected the two-stroke engine, talk of tracking devices - as does the dialogue which leaps between stilted and contemporary modern.Given the money which has thrown at both the cast and the effects - the CGI is state of the art for the time, though still clearly recognisable as such - the film is a lost opportunity.In conclusion the whole thing is just painful to watch.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

371,V.I.D.I.O.T.,"The Load Of Expository Gibberish, or Lots Of Explosions Guaranteed",4,11 July 2003,"For simplicity's sake (and to keep this under 1,000 words) I shall not delve into much comparison to the comic book (go buy it and read it!) - but I must admit that the best moment for me was when the audience broke into spontaneous applause at the opening credit for Alan Moore & Kevin O'Neill. Of course, if I had to find a bookending moment, a nadir for that zenith, I'd have to say the worst moment was the audience breaking into a spontaneous groan when they saw the end credit for ""Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure"", from which footage was apparently purchased for use in this film.  It's not as depressingly obvious as the borrowed footage in ""Impostor"", but is there any better evidence that the filmmakers ran out of money and time, and that what we are left with was not what they started out to make?I often find myself wondering (especially since ""Episode One"") what the definition of a ""film"" has become in these days of one-month shooting and one-year post-production.  If more time, effort and skill is going into the effects and editing than ever went into the actual filming on sets with actors, where is the creativity taking place?  With about 20 seconds of cast credits and 10 minutes of effects crew credits, this film definitely feels like one of the new crop, created wholly in the editing room, utilizing whatever scraps of film they had lying around from this admittedly troubled shoot to fill in the gaps between the effects shots they could easily create in a computer, safe from any meddlesome actors or weather-related Acts Of God.  Now, this approach can, in capable hands, lead to some quality films (see ""Lord Of The Rings""), but ""LXG"" more resembled ""Lost In Space"", ""Supernova"" and ""The Avengers""; films that seemed to be going in an interesting direction until the filmmakers ran out of time and money, ran into studio politics, and had to make do with what they had by the release-date deadline.There is just far too much expository dialogue, explaining things that they apparently never got around to filming.  Picture this:  ""Star Wars"" opens with Threepio and Artoo walking down that corridor, being thrashed about by...  well, by the camera shaking...  and Threepio is shouting about being attacked and being latched onto by a tractor beam, and etc. etc. etc. Picture only that being the opening to ""Star Wars"".  Only the description, not the amazing opening shot of the star destroyer, nor the cutaway shots of the massive docking bay swallowing up the smaller ship.  That's kinda how ""LXG"" feels at times, that people are sitting around describing stuff that you as a movie-goer would really rather see happen.  The middle of the film is especially guilty of this, as we get one long scene where the bad guy explains why he did what he did (via a brilliantly madcap conceit of the director, showing us the villain talking to the camera instead of just a bunch of people sitting around listening to his recorded voice), followed by a big action explosion scene, followed by another long scene in which a League member provides copious (and convenient) amounts of plot-hole-filling.  It's not that the ideas presented aren't interesting, it's just that the presentation is very non-cinematic, feeling more like narration or quick summing-up for those who may have missed last week's episode.  Of course the problem is that there is often only summing-up, because they are summarizing scenes that were never shot in the first place.
The editing is jumpy as well, often dramatically leading up to something and then cutting away to something else before we get there.  As I said, it sometimes feels like these shots with human beings in them are just randomly scattered in as if to justify that it really is a film (""Look!  We did shoot film of actors acting!"") and not a video game cinematic (""Look!  It's yet another beauty shot of the Nautilus swooping by!  And another!  And another! This time it's from the left!  ...Okay look, we're just really proud of this CGI model and we're going to show it off as much as we can, okay?"") And the editing during the fight or chase scenes is pure ""Daredevil"": too fast, too blurry, too much.  Michael Bay may have taken the worst bits of John McTiernan and Tony Scott and turned them into entire films, but now it seems as if people like Norrington are taking the worst bits of Michael Bay and turning them into entire (unwatchable) films...  The very idea of a ""League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" almost writes itself, and it's a bit depressing to be walking out of the theater realizing that someone took this great idea and buried it under a bunch of explosions and fight scenes.Despite these faults, I did actually enjoy the film.  The characters are inherently interesting (Nemo in particular is a delight to watch), and the actors don't get in the way of that enjoyment.  Both Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray are worthy additions to the cast of characters, and each brings something interesting to the story that did not exist in the comic book. Speaking of which, there are a couple of nudge-nudge in-jokes for fans of the comic book, including a poster on a wall that reads, ""Mountains On Mars May Be Volcanos"".  The effects for Skinner (The Invisible Man) work fine, though the best ""effect"" for the character is actor Tony Curran's great voice.  The effects for Hyde vary from passable to excellent, which is thrown into sharp focus by how bad his evil Hulk-ing counterpart looks during their climactic confrontation.  Norrington did this crap before - ending the otherwise good ""Blade"" by having the hero do physical battle with...  a CGI blob...  but at least here it makes good story sense.  The villain's motivation for taking on the League is actually more direct and dramatic than in the comic, though the film doesn't really give this revelation the attention it deserves; one of many very interesting story developments that are skimmed over and not developed.  A shame, since many of these appealing teasers had the audience applauding with glee at what they thought might happen next... and then didn't.  But though the film does feel like a Cliffs-Notes version of the great film it could have been if money and time weren't factors (and hell, they always are), a passable job was done to pull together a coherent film out of whatever was in the can when the money ran out.  At least the key scenes involving the father / son relationship between Quartermain and Sawyer were filmed.  It's nice to see some humanity going on amidst all the explosions.One last note:  at the screening I attended, the film got stuck in the projector right after the end credits completed, and melted away up on screen for all to see.  This may turn out to be a metaphor for the film itself - a blindingly bright explosion of color that is something you've never seen before...  followed by the whole thing dissolving in memory, like whisps of smoke that look like something interesting for a second if you apply your own imagination, but turn out to be just plain old smoke, dissipating quickly in the night air...",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

It's just a movie, and I might add not a very good one.  It is not a horrible movie, not worthy of being added to ""Worst List of 2003"" and certainly not capable of being on anyone's ""Best"" list for any period of time.  The cast, well suited for the parts; the story line, imaginative (if far-fetched); the acting, fair (some times a bit over done); the directing, I am not sure.  I will say this, I left the theater feeling as if I had been subjected to a couple of hours of endless Saturday matinee serial adventures.  The main thing I took away from this theater trip, was a feeling that there are some special effects teams and editors out there that need to find other jobs.Conclusion, if you have an afternoon (so you can take advantage of those matinee prices) and not much else to do, go see it.

374,TheDemko,Extraordinarily stupid...,2,12 July 2003,"That's exactly what you have to be to enjoy this movie. This is the most 'hollywood-ized' comic book movie I've been forced to endure yet. The plot was weak, at best, the research for the movie (that was the Hindu god SHIVA, not Kali - and Italy's 'Festival' doesn't happen anywhere NEAR July) was done by monkeys, and the script and its wooden dialogue sounds like it was written by 4-year-olds. If you can utterly turn off all logic and reason, the eye-candy makes the movie worthwhile. The cast is excellent, and all well-suited to their respective roles (especially Jekyll/Hyde and Tom Sawyer) and given another more talented pool of screenwriters, this could have turned out to be an excellent movie. Unfortunately for us all, it wasn't. Most comic-book geeks will complain that this movie wasn't anywhere near the graphic novel, and that much I'll agree with... but my biggest complaint is all the plotholes, inconsistencies, and just plain out WRONG facts interspersed throughout the movie.Recommendation to avoid, unless you're brain dead and are just going to watch the pretty pictures.2 out of a possible 10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
375,ableape,Disappointing,5,14 July 2003,"By the feeling I got from the previews, my predictions were correct.  This movie had potential.  In its actors, its premise, its setting, and its production.  But it succumbed to the ""Hollywood"" virus that doesn't discriminate what it infects.  Granted, it was (loosely) based on a comic book (calling it a ""graphic novel"" in the credits doesn't give it more validity), but at least the 2 X-Men movies have proved that you can make a decent movie out of one.  Even allowing for the suspension of disbelief (and believe me, my disbelief hung out so long it got eaten alive by carrion fowl) still wasn't enough to ignore the plot holes.   On the positive side, the acting seemed slightly above par, if only due to Sean Connery's compelling presence.  And they do a decent job of hiding the old man's age (what is he, like, 80 now?).  The editing of the action sequences were fast-paced to keep your ADD in check, and the effects were decent.  But there seemed to be too much screen time spent on them, especially Captain Nemo's toys (soon to be found at a toy store near you, possibly in the discount rack).   About 10 minutes could be cut out from the redundant shots of the Nautilus ship alone.  George Lucas said it a long time ago (in a galaxy very, very near), that giving your props as much screen time as your other actors is a mistake.  And especially with the attention-challenged kids keeping up with the lightning-quick fight shots, this can seem like an eternity.   Aside from the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde character appearing hulkily familiar, this movie just tries to put a new ""old"" spin on the X-Men, and comes up short.

379,mnemosyne23,Palatable summer fare,7,12 July 2003,"Comic book movies seem to be all the rage in Hollywood, from the ""X-Men"" franchise to ""Spider-Man.""  This is hardly a new craze - ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" are well-established franchises - but there certainly seems to be a glut of them at the moment.  I mean, ""The Punisher?""  The hell are they doing bringing that old chestnut to the big screen.Ah well.  C'est la vie.  For those who thrive on comics and graphic novels, it's a good time to be alive.  I'm not one of those people, but its amazing to see the range of such material available for adaptation.  ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" based on the work of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, is such a fascinating concept, I'm surprised it wasn't made into a film sooner.  The story unites some of the 19th century's most famous - and infamous - literary characters in a fight to save the world from the nefarious plans of an evil mastermind.  While it's not on a par with ""Spider-Man,"" and nowhere near the league of ""X2,"" ""LXG"" packs enough of a whollop to be worth the price of a matinee ticket.  If you're going to an evening show, I suggest you take a lot of friends and try to get a group discount, because it's just not worth $8.The leader of the League is Alan Quatermain (""King Solomon's Mines""), played by the indomitable Sean Connery, who does a wonderful job as a crotchety old Great White Hunter.  Joining him on the quest is Dorian Gray (""The Portrait of Dorian Gray,"" Stuart Townsend), an immortal, laissez faire aristocrat; Mina Harker (""Dracula,"" Peta Wilson), a vampire;  Rodney Skinner (taking the place of Claude Raines, ""The Invisible Man,"" played by Tony Curran); Dr. Jekyll (and his infamous alter ego, Mr. Hyde), from Robert Louis Stevenson's book of the same name, played by Jason Flemyng; Captain Nemo (""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" Naseeruddin Shah), a pirate; and Tom Sawyer (""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" Shane West), a spy and all-American good ole boy. Recruited by a mysterious figure called M, the League is instructed to stop a wicked villain - known as the Phantom (of ""of the Opera"" fame) - from starting a world war.  On top of that small order, they have to wrap it up in four days.Well.  That doesn't leave much time for a breather for our heroes, nor does it leave the movie much chance to establish any kind of character development.  Each figure is introduced in whirlwind fashion, and their backgrounds are forcefed to the audience in blink-and-you'll-miss-it soundbytes.  Mina's story of being bitten by the man himself, Count Dracula, is told so quickly, you almost don't realize it's been mentioned at all. They're thrown together over the course of fifteen minutes, and begin functioning like a well-oiled machine soon after.  I find it a bit hard to believe that these disparate figures of questionable morality would gel so quickly, but since this is the movies, I'll suspend my disbelief.
Most of the screentime is dominated by Connery (let's face it, it's his movie), West (with Connery), and Townsend (who proves to the world that he can play a smarmy b***ard, but would have been AWFUL as Aragorn in ""LotR""). Interesting characters, yes, but more time needed to be given to the others! Tantalizing hints of a Mina/Dorian/Jekyll love triangle remain just that - hints.  I especially mourn this loss because I would have loved to see this triangle come to fruition: the three characters with the most moral and spiritual corruption, interacting on such a personal level.  The possibilities for drama and character development are staggering.  A slightly more prominent Mina/Dorian/Tom triangle bears a bit more fruit, but the fruit is runty and not worth eating.  Nemo is enigmatic by the end of the film - how good can a man be who worships Kali, Hindu goddess of death? And honestly, I forgot Curran was even in the movie - he disappears (literally and figuratively) for at least three-quarters of the film.The effects were good, but not great.  Nemo's ""Nautilus"" was beautiful, inside and out, and his ""automobile"" was fantastic.  Mina's ability to morph into a flock of vampire bats was impressive as well.  Mr. Hyde - a primarily CGI character - was believable enough, but in a world where Gollum rules supreme, the big brute just didn't live up to standard.  The fight scenes were okay, but not memorable.  The only exception is a knockdown match between Hyde and an uber-Hyde wannabe.You'll hear people complain that there was too much modern technology (eg, machine guns, cars, tanks, etc) in the movie.  Tell them to suck it up and pay attention - that was the whole frelling POINT.In the end, I'll say that most of this movie's ills could have been cured by a few script changes and an extra hour's running time.  Quatermain's father-complex towards Sawyer was written so bluntly, it was almost painful, and many moments that are meant to be climactic and shocking were obvious to me five minutes into the movie.  Flemyng, Curran and Wilson were so underused, it's criminal.  How can you sideline Dr. Jekyll, an invisible man, and a vampire?  It boggles the mind.But perhaps I'm just being picky.  This is a summer movie, after all, and it gives the audience everything they're expecting: explosions, fight scenes, a few humorous quips, and plenty of moody lighting. If nothing else, perhaps this movie will prompt audiences to go out and pick up the books from which the characters are derived.  I, for one, intend to finally dust off a copy of Oscar Wilde's ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray.""  I suggest you do the same.

I haven't read the graphic novel, but the story written for the movie is quite charming.Allan Quatermain is an old hero of England residing in Africa, when her majesty's agent comes seeking his help, asking him to lead a group of ""talented"" individuals against a man trying to start a world war to make profits from selling guns. The individuals include a vampire, an immortal man, an invisible man, Dr Jekyl/Mr Hyde and a man known as Captain Nemo.The first half of the movie consist of character introduction and development.

With all of these 'comic-book movies', there has to be a certain amount of suspension of disbelief.  I mean, chances of someone being bit my a superspider turning into a spider-man themselves?  Slim to none (chances, on the other hand, of them dying of a super-spider super-poison, on the other hand...not so slim...but that doesn't make for much of a movie for kids :)However, LXG kinda takes it to the extreme.  I mean, since when did the basic laws of physics no longer apply? (superman excepted, of course)  A massive submarine that can...maneuver the canals of Venice??  Not only does this movie have cars in 1899...the cars are indestructible?  Men in iron suits deflecting bullets?  (this could fall under the 'suspension of disbelief headline, if there weren't so MANY things like this)  Quartermain is a crack shot...even when he's not actually sighting down the barrel of his weapon?  You get the hint...I could spend hours detailing the things in this movie that are physically impossible.Anyway, it was good for Saturday matinee entertainment, but not exactly Oscar material.

This movie is one of the worst i have ever seen. Sean Connery needs to choose his movies more carefully. Shane West looked wonderful as usual and he acted pretty well.

386,pgeo2286,Not as bad as it seems,6,14 December 2004,"""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is based on a comic book series from the '90s by the same name. With that in mind, it's easier to accept the gross anachronisms and implausible events (like Venice blowing up) that take place within the film. While LXG is nothing more than an action flick to pluck into the DVD player on a dull evening, it provides more than enough entertainment to keep most moviegoers happy. The LXG, an all-star team of classic literature characters, is an fun group to root for. With Sean Connery as Allan Quartermain and aging leader of the pack, Dr. Jeckel/Mr. Hyde, an adult Tom Sawyer, The Invisible Man, and Dorian Grey to name a few it is great to see these characters overcome their flaws to work together and defeat the generic brand of evil they are fighting against in the movie. While the twist in this movie isn't exactly a twist at all, it does enough to keep the movie going to the end. The action isn't half bad either, and the first scene with Sean Connery doing a good old fashioned butt-whupping definitely covered the cost of the 4 dollar popcorn I spent at the theatre. 2.5 out of 4.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
387,Budruss,Had Potential,2,21 February 2011,"WARNING - Major spoilers!The concept behind this movie is quite clever; bring together several fictitious characters to form a sort of ""justice league"" in the late 1800s. But there were problems.Big ones.Turning off my brain and suspending disbelief got me about one-third of the way into this movie. Yes, I can let go of the fact that they recruited Mr. Hyde, a murderer of innocents. Sure, I can overlook the fact that Skinner, having stolen the formula from the original scientist, managed to find a way to avoid going homicidally insane. I could even get past the automatic rifles and guided missiles in an era where cartridge-based firearms were a relatively new invention.All these things are simply a matter of buying into the movie's premise. However, I found myself cringing at a few of the more glaring elements of the writing that rather ruined the entire movie for me. A good place to start is quite a few of the lines that were pathetic attempts to be clever, but simply fall flat on the ground and twitched. Such as: ""And I imagine you must have quite the library, Mr. Quatermain. All those books you must have read merely by looking at their covers."" ""I hoped I'd get to nail you one more time. Didn't think it'd be literally."" Ungh.And worst of all while Skinner is laying on the floor burned and smoking he quips ""I'll never play with matches again."" Really? That's the best they (the writers) could do? Next we have characters that seem to change personalities throughout the movie. One minute Hyde is an indestructible force who needs help from no one. The next he's calling for help from, of all people, Nemo, who he then immediately advises to run when he arrives. Finally, there are the little plot incongruities that seem to blatantly defy the laws of common sense, like the Nautilus fitting through the canals of Venice even though it's been demonstrated to be about the size of an aircraft carrier. Or Dorian suddenly wasting away at the sight of his portrait, even though it had been suggested before that it had been hanging in his house until Moriarty stole it. Didn't he also mention that he had seen it getting older and older while he remained young? And how exactly did he smuggle and plant the half-dozen or so identical suitcase explosives without someone, either a main character or a crewman saying to themselves ""Huh, that's strange. I wonder what's in those boxes with the odd clock-like thing attached to them?"".Though this movie did have a few fun moments as well, for instance the part where Qautermain is pinned down by enemy gunfire and exclaims ""Automatic rifles?! Who in god's name has automatic rifles?"".""Most unsporting."" Agrees Nigel, ""Probably Belgian.""And during the battle between the immortal Dorian and vampiric Mina which Dorian observes as his wounds heal instantly; ""We'll be at this all day.""These, while funny, are simply not enough to keep the film from becoming very lousy very quickly. And in the third act it rather falls apart completely. A sequel was hinted at by the final seconds of the final scene, but lets hope it's just allowed to die.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
388,quickquirk,An Adventure In A League Of Its Own,8,28 February 2006,"For the life of me, I haven't been able to understand why this film has so many detractors. For the record, I love this film. I'll go into why later. However, I would like to correct the misconception that people who like such-films are devoid of brain activity. When I watch a movie, I look for one thing  pure, unadulterated ENTERTAINMENT. And LXG is exactly that. Sure, we all like to be intellectual at times with heavy-going films, but if you're looking to escape from the real world and not going to wonder about the quintessence of life, this movie is for you.What's not to love in this movie? For starters, the pace is brisk and the audience is treated to a bizarre but intriguing array of characters. The characters start off with palpable mistrust of one another, but as the movie progresses and when the true traitor is revealed, they (with the exception of Dorian Gray) gradually develop a sense of understanding and camaraderie between one another, which was very well done. I have to say that while the pace and SFX of this movie were fabulous, the movie's unifying element was the remarkable Sean Connery as the hunter Alan Quatermain, who curiously enough, only seems to get better with age! He was at turns heroic, jaded, eccentric, aloof and vulnerable at once, delivering his lines in his trademark voice with panache and depth. He held the movie together with his incredible presence and charisma. Quatermain later takes Shane West's Tom Sawyer character under his wing and this gives the movie its added poignancy and warmth. West also gave a great turn as the immensely likable and courageous Tom Sawyer, the American spy with the lopsided grin, hip swagger and impulsive shooting approach. In fact, the cast all delivered great performances as their respective characters. Jason Flemyng as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde also presented a nuanced performance as the conflicted Dr. Jekyll. By the way, this is the best movie depiction of Mr. Hyde so far (especially if you compare him with the awful one in Van Helsing). Stuart Townsend was also annoyingly dandified and convincingly incorrigible as the beautiful but damned Dorian Gray. I did have some reservations about Peta Wilson initially, who played Mina Harker, but she ahem, bit into her role with relish and her electrifying eyes truly gave off the bloodthirsty air of a vampire. Equally delightful were Naseeruddin Shah as the mysterious but loyal Captain Nemo and Tony Curran as Rodney Skinner, the irreverent invisible man.All in all, this was, and is, a fun and extremely enjoyable movie. Don't know if anyone realized, but there are certain great movies that can only be watched ONCE. However, there are others that can be rewatched about a million times. LXG is a perfect example of the latter. Watch it often enough and its multitude of hilarious and memorable lines will soon be making their way into your everyday speech. Well, at least that's what happened to me. I still feel as excited during the action bits as I did when I first watched it. So check it out! It's pure escape. And pure entertainment.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Everything is pretty straightforward about it (except for a few things that actually, caught me by surprise, mostly because of all the fake rumors out there) - the character motivations, the plot, etc.  I'm sick of critics bashing something just because they seem to be the only ones that don't ""get it.""

While there were major differences between the characters and the books they were taken from, for the most part it was like seeing old friends, i knew what the various characters would do becuase they kept the proper personalities.  I even figured out who the villian was because I noticed one of the major works of victorian literature that was missing from the movie. And you do not need to have read all of these books to understand the movie, but there is a bit of a lack of character developement that you may find, but my friends who hadn't done the reading also enjoyed the movie.It has great visual effects, some really good action sequences, and a really nice looking car.

Unfortunately the resulting movie is a huge disappointment, with one overblown set piece after another, expecting you to know enough about each of the characters from their books to care about them and understand the interaction.The biggest disappointment of all was Sean Connery who has become a caricature of himself - even the trailer says that Sean Connery leads the league, rather than the character he plays.  He attended the UK premiere - something he has not done in the UK for many years, presumably to save it from near disaster at the British box office.While I didn't enjoy it, I'm sure that they are plenty out there who did, so give it a go, but leave your brain at the door.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

And then someone makes a movie out of it and screws everything up.  Only the germ of genius at its core saves this movie from being another Rollerball or Battlefield Earth.  To those reviewers who enjoyed it, I envy you; both my $6.50 and a great concept were wasted here.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
400,backstr,How to take a good idea and ruin it,3,24 February 2004,"This is not a good movie. In this case, it is especially sad that the movie is bad, since the general idea is so original and good. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is, as many already have pointed out, originally a comic. A collection of characters known from (what we today call) classic literature are brought together to serve the British empire in a time of need. The film makers added a couple of characters to the League, Dorian Grey and Tom Sawyer, and replaced the invisible man from H.G. Well's novel with another invisible man. Dorian Grey fits in, but Tom Sawyer is misplaced and the single reason for putting him there was to put an American Hero in the center. The comic this film is based on is a masterpiece. It is a piece of extremely brutal, depressingly dark fiction from the backyards of the ""glorious"" Empire of England. The recycling of fictional characters, as well as the extensive use of science-fiction technology from the late 1800's gives a nice frame to the storytelling. The story has depth, and at least I hinted quite a portion of social critisism and satire between the speech bubbles. In the comic, there are no heroes - there is no good side - which makes it interesting. In the movie, this is all turned upside down. The frame is the same, but the message is reversed. The story, although the actual line of events show similarities, was diminished to a Hollywoodistic battle between heroes and villains, between good guys with noble intentions and bad guys who are rotten to heart and soul, in the same manner as we have seen hundreds of times before.Now, what I outline above would reduce The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to a standard action movie. Unfortunately, it is not good even when judged as such. There are thrilling events, I admit that, and many parts do tickle the imagination, but the plot really has problems not falling apart. Most of the time, you are left thinking ""why on earth did they do that?"" and ""how could THIS lead to THAT?"" Special effects and acting are OK, but when the rest of the film crumbles this can save very little. To conclude, I can recommend anyone interesting in comic books to get a copy of the League, but this movie should only be seen as an example of how to take a good idea and ruin it.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
401,a-mar,Being American is not a super power.,5,15 July 2003,"No offense to Shane West, who played the part just fine.  But the presence of Tom Sawyer in this movie exemplifies pretty much everything that is wrong with it.  Alan Moore's story has been modified, the studio freely admits, to appeal to a broad (and American) audience.  Not only are these changes annoying, but the idea that they would make the story more appealing to me is downright insulting.It's 1899 - bear that in mind.  The heroes of this story include a legendary hunter blessed by witch doctors, a vampire, a man made immortal by a magic painting, an invisible man, an engineering genius with futuristic technology and his own army, and a scientist who turns into a beast.  And Tom Sawyer. Yes, they made him a secret agent.  But come on, even Paul Bunyan would have made more sense.Bunyan wouldn't have been able to create the same ""youthful American"" image however.  That image is described by Connery's Quartermain as ""fire enough bullets and maybe you'll hit something"".  But of course this style is redeemed, in a scene that begins with Sawyer saying ""wanna go for a spin"" and peeling out in a convertible.  All right, it's Nemo's car.  But still. I take it that was added for my benefit too.The other problem, which also arises from adapting the movie to a blockbuster 110 min screenplay, is trying to make the audience know and care about all these characters.  In that, the movie fails miserably, somehow managing to give both too much and too little information.  During a voyage by submarine that plays about as excitingly as someone reading aloud footnotes from my old history textbook, we learn a little about the background of each character.  This is of course necessary, and it's probably best that Norrington didn't spend a whole movie introducing them (a la X-Men: The First Movie).  Still, there must be a better way to do it. Perhaps he should have excluded irrelevant little bits that couldn't really be follow through - like that Quartermain lost his son, or that Harker and Gray were lovers.As a whole, however, the plot line is interesting enough and the special effects are excellent.  The acting was also commendable - I particularly enjoyed Flemyng's portrayal of Dr. Jekyll. I also liked being introduced to Naseeruddin Shah as Captain Nemo since I don't watch Indian movies and haven't seen his handful of English work.  I only wish they'd been given better dialogue to work with.Overall I would say wait for this movie to come out on video or possibly on TV.  It's the kind of thing you can watch while multitasking on a weekday night.  If you don't pay too much attention to the details, you'll come away thinking it's an entertaining story with great characters in a twisty little plot.Rating:  5/10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

403,AngelOfPolitik,"Hmph, I Enjoyed It",7,14 February 2008,"What can I say? Despite everyone hating this film, I'm in the minority of those who like it. Well, I am a fan of classic literature (And Captain Nemo in particular.) so I was immediately attracted to this film. And even though I had mixed expectations, I actually didn't feel like I wasted my time.Yes, the film isn't much like the comic book. Well, it would be hard to adapt the comic as faithfully as possible into a film and to adhere to a PG-13 rating, now wouldn't it be? Besides, I've seen worse mutilations of the source material. Take any recent adaptation of a work of Jules Verne and this will look faithful. And unlike most total mutilations, this actually worked, at least for me.I must say, the casting was good. Sean Connery did a superb job, and with him on the cast, it can;t be that bad. I can only say that Naseeruddin Shah, while for once correctly portraying Captain Nemo as an Indian, had to have done the worst acting in the film. But I've seen worse, still. The special effects weren't the worst I've seen, except for the Nautilus. Not to mention they totally hashed the design of the Nautilus, to my disappointment. It would be just as easy to stick to the comics or to Verne's original design (If the tentacles would be too hard to render), right? The plot, while thin, was not the worst I've seen. While this film may have been more of a special effects and action showcase, I am easily amused by effects and action. But they didn't need to have Tom Sawyer. Coming from a user who's as American as they get, he seemed unneeded and filler, probably only to attract teenage girls.While the film had it's errors and plot holes and other things (Really, they fail to explain how Dorian is immortal and Hyde is the hulk, when he was a short young man in R. L. Stevenson's works. And how Nemo got serious martial arts skills and more crew than we can count.) I just had to turn my mind off, and maybe turn it on and have fun pointing them out. But there are a few complaints I have seen in reviews that I should clear up:Number one goes along the lines of ""Captain Nemo is British! Why is he Indian in this?!"" Ironically, this film got it right. He is Indian. I advise you read The Mysterious Island or even part two of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and not trust Hollywood and James Mason on Nemo's nationality next time.Another was ""This is the league of extraordinary gentlemen! Why is there a woman?!"" I do realize Hollywood likes to insert random female characters in movies based off classic literature, but Mina was in the comics, and part of the league, and with a major role. Calling this ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and One Lady"" would be stupid IMHO.The one that irks me the most is the complaints about fast cars, submarines, tanks and other cool technology in 1899, when they were years in the making. Here's something; it's an ALTERNATE UNIVERSE! This is where all fiction is real, where you can have fast cars and large submarines before the 20th century. You must hate Jules Verne then, and his literary fantasies way ahead of his time. Besides, I have read in another review that the comic had anachronistic technology as well.Another minor complaint by one reviewer said that the Invisible Man was almost inaudible, but I could understand him clearly. And my hearing is horrifically faulty for your information.While this isn't a flaw, reviewers are saying that you must be under twelve or mentally retarded to enjoy this film. When I saw this, I was over twelve and, like now, had above average intelligence. And my younger brother didn't like it as much as me, to throw some irony at your statement.So this wasn't a masterpiece. Nor would I watch it over and over and over again, but if you are in the mood for action, adventure, or Sean Connery, this is a pretty good choice.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
404,apk2043,Better than many reviewers say.,9,13 July 2003,"(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) First, let me say that I didn't read the graphic novel until after seeing the film, but in my opinion that wasn't such a bad thing. Some may have a few problems with the changes to some of the characters, especially Mina Harker(Murray) and Quatermain, but I felt that the changes were okay for the big screen. If they had done a straight adaptation I believe many, including myself, would have found it too slow and boring. I liked that Norrington went with the fast-paced action style. I felt that all of the actors were perfect for their roles, except of course for Shane West. He delivered his lines a bit to dryly and without emotion. Aside from that I did like the fact that they included the character of Tom Sawyer as a type of protege for Quatermain. Peta Wilson played her character perfectly, as did Connery. Nemo was well done too. I was impressed by how close they kept many of the costumes and designs to the comic versions. Nemo's sub was quite different from the comics, but an improvement in my eyes. Mr. Hyde's CGI was very impressive as was the Invisible Man's. I was simply floored when I saw Rodney Skinner applying the white makeup and turning about. I've heard a lot of others say that Townsend's acting was pathetic, but I found him very convincing as Dorian Gray.While the story was fairly simple and straight forward, overall, I enjoyed the whole experience. It was simply a fun comic book based movie with plenty of action, adventure, and excitement.

Granted it got an absolute slating and the special effects were a big let down, but there were some great points. It was fun and with a swashbuckling story line similar to the classic action films like 'Indiana Jones' and 'Around the world in 80 days' (the original!). I do not think it deserved the bad press from people who call themselves 'critics' and should be watched with an open mind.The Acting was nothing special and the casting of Sean Connery was questionable but the remaining cast were good, all opening up possibilities for more successful roles. Stuart Townsend was certainly one of these as his character (although not in the original graphic novel) made a lasting impression. Not as bad as people make out and a good Saturday night movie all round!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
414,abbyart,Fictional characters are assembled to fight a phantom menace threatening to blow up Venice in the late 1800's,1,10 June 2005,"This movie illustrates everything that is wrong with America, and the American film industry. In it, the characters are secondary to the demonstration of martial skill, and the incoherence of the excessively violent action bespeaks a special effects machine gone wild. I wasn't bothered by the fantasy elements of the plot, but by the callous disregard for the audience exhibited by the film's creators. It was, as others have stated, often impossible to figure out what was going on, and I eventually had to turn my eyes from the omnipresent smoothly rhythmic unfolding of computer-generation. This movie made me yearn for the comparatively adult fantasies of the past, with special effects by Ray Harryhausen. I know that I do not belong to the movie's target audience, being over the age of twelve, but I wonder what sort of child would be attracted to this violent, ugly mess.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

416,Sandor82,Read a book,7,20 September 2005,"I was very cynical about this movie when I rented it. I still am very cynical about this movie. Let us first observe the plot: Several super-heroes of classic western literature fighting evil. That would about summarise it. There are many things that can be said about American cinema in the 21st century, but what we see is this: we have no more stories. An incredible amount of productions have in one way or another leaned on classical stories, comic books or previous movies. This is, in my personal opinion, a very bad thing and I am against this often shallow recycling of the classic stories.Even so, this movie managed to entertain me. Not merely of the amount of explosions and special effects, but also of the way that the characters are presented. Of course, this movie is by no means suitable to replace a lesson in classic western literature, but it does succeed in something else.The characters are laid out in such a way, that one could become interested in them. What stories does Quatermain have? Where did Dorian get his picture painted? Where has Nemo been with his boat? My advice is: Read a book.I agree; the special effects are nowhere near what modern standards seem to be. But they were sufficient and nowhere really the main focus of the production. I did not read the graphic novels that this movie was based on according to the credits, but I wonder how much this matters. What this movie is, is a stimulation for Hollywood audiences to become just a little more curious for the stories that so many movies rely on.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
417,pjdoughnut,Worst Comic Book Film Ever.,1,4 July 2009,"It is no wonder that the esteemed Mr Moore wanted no more to do with Hollywood after this. I will preface this by saying that I saw the movie before reading the comic book so I had no reason to be comparing it. I watched it expecting very little and still with low expectations I was disappointed. The story was rubbish the effects middling the action forgettable. Surely the idea with a movie like this is that it is an ensemble piece with all the different characters having a part. Yet the only one to really feature was Connery's character, who was basically not Allan Quatermain but as always is simply Sean Connery. The end fight is possibly the weakest end/death sequence I ve ever seen and was neither exciting nore adrenaline pumping. Bad guy runs away, Tom Sawyer aims shoots, kills him. Rubbish. There are many other terrible things about the movie only thrown into sharper relief when I actually read the comic book. Having read it I saw no reason why this film could nt have been made closer to the comic - there is plenty of action in it. More than say Watchmen, which was much harder being a lot longer and more complex. I expect it was the desire to make it as commercial as possible that made them alter the characters to make them bland and clichéd- one of the points of the comic was the chance to re envisage classic characters in a new way. This is interesting and would have made for a great and still exciting movie. However I realise that at the time the comic book movie genre was still primarily a family audience pre sin city and Watchmen, so naturally the Hollywood cretins skimmed through the book, took the idea and completely messed it up to make more money. If made today there is every chance that it would have been more faithful but as this movie was such a disaster it will never happen now I m sure. In an interview Stephen Norrington said that he did nt want to make a faithful adaptation, he wanted to make a blockbuster, but even in this he failed for the movie boasted not a single stand out action sequence. It says a lot about a movie when the best bit was an unintentionally hilarious line from Dorian Grey - ""I m complicated."" Pity the film itself was nt. It s also one thing to note that this is the film that sent Sean Connery into retirement and Stephen Norrington into obscurity. While I feel sorry for the loss of Sean( not even a cameo as Indy s Dad could lure him away from the golf course) I have to say Stephen Norrington deserved to loose whatever reputation he had after ballsing this film up so spectacularly.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

It's hard for me to see what all the venom is about.  This was a fantasy movie, pure and simple, with a completely preposterous premise and an absurd plot.  I loved every minute of it.  I expected it to be over the top, and it was. I have read most of the source material (the comic series and about half of the original novels), and I thought this movie did the characters justice. My complaints are few and minor.  Tom Sawyer grew up in antebellum Mississippi, and should have been about fifty years old by the time of this film, and I was disppointed by how Dorian Gray was handled.  That's a shame on both counts, because I thought adding those two characters was inspired, and I wish they had been more satisfactorily developed.

Unfortunately, the movie team seems to have had an overlook at the comic. All the positive strengths of the original story have vanished ! The cast is obviously bad directed, the set are awfully ugly, the special effects cheesy, the music far too trite... And it is a painfully long movie, with pathetic plot twists.

It may be a little odd to people who don't know anything about the characters and their abilities outside of the movie.

Where is Tom Sawyer in the book anyway? I did like him in the movie but why do they have to add characters when they couldn't even describe their original ones well. The only thing that kept this movie going was Sean Connery's acting and the effects. That was enough for me to give it six out of ten stars. The movie was dark and perfect for a comic book type movie and I enjoyed the fight sequences with Captain Nemo and Mina Harker against Dorian Gray. I can see why the critics gave this movie a one star rating, but it's not that bad.This movie also seemed to have too many special effects-don't get me wrong that's a good thing to have but there could have been more of a story then just action.

The dialogue, the characters, all corny. The relationship between the american kid and Sean Connery: Ultra Corny. The dialogue: super corny. The outfit of the Bad Guy: Rediculously corny (he looked like a member of KISS whose face was burned in a fire). The worst character was Nemo. Call me crazy, but in 20K leagues beneath the sea, i dont think nemo was a Karate Fighting, Super Speed Powered, Sword Fighting Middle Easterner. AHAHA .Argh. I just cant explain how corny this movie was.Also, there were some glaring errors in the movie. For one, the bad guy was going to make millions by selling his ultra advanced machines to the world because nobody else had his technology. My question is, if nemo could make the Nautilus, a super advanced giant ship that can shoot giant rockets that can track any target, why didnt they just have Nemo make some cool machines, then the bad guys machines wouldnt sell. Another error is when sean connery jumps out of a car that is going at LEAST 60 mph. He just casually jumps out and lands on his feet and sTops moving! this is impossible hahahah.All i can say is this movie is just plain goofy. Nothing really good to say about it.

Well who cares - It works! I even like it better than 'Wanted' which was spoiled by a silly voice-over. No reason for it to be trashed so much ... I even find it less corny than most bond films. Sure it could've been deeper, darker and stretched out even more but for me it works. The vehicles are well thought out and suitably over-the-top. Locations well-chosen and dramatic.

433,gamgee5273,Goes well with popcorn,8,12 July 2003,"Spoilers AheadI have to admit - I'm a fan of Alan Moore's, but I've managed to miss reading the books for one reason or another.  I'm also sure that the books are better in their storytelling and plot than the movie is.  That said, I think this is a fairly good popcorn movie - strong action scenes, some good jokes, etc.  Having been an English major in college and having read my fair share of Victorian works, I would say that the movie does a wonderful job inhabiting the non-fictional world with fictional characters.The possible sequel threads that can be pull from this are remarkable. After all, if Nemo is alive, it is possible to see his island base from Verne's ""Mysterious Island,""  Fogg was mentioned circling the world in 80 days, there can be trips attempted to the moon, the Victorian utopias that were created at the time could be visited...etc. And, let us not forget, that if Moriarty was the bad guy in this, are Sherlock or Mycroft Holmes (now that's a character to do a study of drug addiction with) too far behind?Norrington, as a directors, was better with ""Blade"" than he was here.  I think he was given a better script for that movie, however.  I also suspect he really didn't put his heart into it at places (except in Africa - he did some very nice shooting there). Again, all of that being said, he surprised me with what he managed to do with the movie (just as he did with ""Blade"") and exceed my expectations.I think a solid 8.0 out of 10 is well-deserved here.

Even if Moriarty is picking the League (and I know he wouldn't pick Holmes) wouldn't Holmes find out about it? And how could you the ultimate crime fighting League without Holmes? * If Moriarty's plan is to get a sample of various characters DNA or whatever, why can't he just visit them himself? With the exception of the Vampire and Mr.Hyde (which Dorian Grey could get) none of them are hard to find or dangerous to Moriarty, until he puts them all together.

Not often am I in the mood for such a movie, but this was certainly one of those rare moments.

It's just another one of those crazy fiction stylization-heavy special effects showoffs with a ridiculous plot constructed entirely of clichés. Well, LXG might even stand out here somewhat, as the number of clichés it contains truly is staggering, I did not know you could pile together THAT many into one movie. The special effects are top-notch, and enjoyable quite on their own. There were plenty of visually stunning scenes, and several moments with great atmosphere. Some of the creativity was actually quite impressive, so that also even stands out a bit. And then, of course, it had Sean Connery. What more can you ask? It is as good as this type of movies get without starting to require a bit of thinking on behalf of the viewer.I can't see how anyone could be disappointed with this film, these people must have had some really outlandish expectations. Because while I knew nothing of what LXG was (I hear it's a comic book?), after spending two minutes at the IMDb and Wikipedia I knew EXACTLY what to expect and the movie turned out to be PRECISELY what I thought it would be.

Anything goes at that point...Action is a lot of fun. Dorian Gray is the best character and most fun to watch.  Though captain Nemo and Mina the vampire are also cool.

Then there's Dorian Gray who does his hitting with appropriate nonchalance, but also not much else. There's the invisible man who uses his talent to walk up to people unseen and THEN hit them on the head. I'm not kidding, this script has not half the intellectual equivalence of zip.

452,blagh,"Cue Cheesy Line; The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Extraordinary Indeed.",8,11 July 2003,"The film is hard to dislike. For all it's flaws, I found it was quite enjoyable.Starring Sean Connery as Allan Quatermain, The League is based on the comic book, or graphic novel, of the same name, written by Alan Moore and drawn by Kevin O'Neill. From the start of the film, one feels as if they are actually IN this universe, seeing these things none have ever seen before (at that time).Many complain about this flick being a fast paced, brainless action flick that summer movie going teenage boys will enjoy, and others will hate. I can easily see how one would say this, because at first glance, it appears to be true. But the people who seem to dislike this film are those who really don't get it. They complain about silly things, like the time period being screwed up, or the fact continuity is ignored, and etc., etc.First off, it doesn't take a genius to see that a lot of the continuity that is supposedly ignore happens for good reason. Example, Dorian's re-appearing clothes. He's a living painting. His damaged image restores to it's natural state each time. It should've been OBVIOUS by the fact while others change their clothes, or appear different, Dorian always has the same attire.Now, the story is quite good. It takes a lot from the graphic novel and tosses a lot out the window. I thought the story didn't have a great many plot holes, like some would say. Any that were visable I must have clearly missed in my viewings. However, I can say some things bugged me. Example, Quatermain jumping from Nemo's vehicle at sixty and landing perfectly still, or Quatermain calling the ""auto-mobile"" a ""car"" in one scene.Aside from those small things, I didn't think the film was bad at all. The effects were great for the sort've movie that was trying to be made. It was intended to LOOK like a comic book, and the whole World of Fiction thing is just too good. There were also many little things scattered about the movie that fans of the comic, AND literature of that time period, could smile about and go, ""Aha! I got it.""All in all, I give the league four stars out've five. Why? Because. I wanted the movie to keep going, to show a little bit more. I wanted some scenes to actually drag on, because they were quite entertaining.But in the end, go see the movie to formulate your own opinion on it. Don't let Ebert or any anal retentive person formulate an opinion for you.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
453,dand81,Outstanding use of mixed imaginations,10,29 July 2003,"There were far too many literary and cinematic references used in this film to name, but if you can imagine one piece of every action adventure, mystery, and horror film ever made then you could get an idea of what thinking went into this.  I have read reviews both on IMDB and elsewhere that didn't speak too highly of this movie.  I disagree.  I was extremely entertained.  Granted, I do have the handicap of being a huge fan of Sean Connery, but one must realize there is a reason he is still making films. HE IS COOL.  It begins with a mission of worldly importance for a motley group of would-be heroes/villains assembled to save the world.  There are some incredible fight scenes, and great effects.  This movie has some great performances, fantastic twists, and edge of your seat intrigue.  I will definitely be purchasing this DVD for my collection, and would eagerly view a sequel.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
454,spar10,Go read the comic.,6,22 July 2003,"An entertaining summer movie. Didn't quite live up to the comic book, but action scenes were good. Visually excellent, except for the Mr. Hyde character. Not much in the way of characterization, predictable plot.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
455,Blackpool34,The Film They Love To Hate,7,3 April 2017,"Like jim Morrison said ""Eric Von Stroheim in the movies. The man they love to hate"". This film is one that critics the world over just love to hate! I first watched it in 2003 in the cinema when it had just come out and thought it was an enjoyable romp of a film then. Iv'e just watched it in 2017 all these years later and loved it, had a great laugh watching it! We are not talking clever, intricate high art here when it comes to comicbook adaptions ( Dark Night Rises, Logan etal), and i know all about Sean Connery's attitude towards it plus the ""dropping"" of the Fu manchu character and the Inclusion of Tom Sawyer to appease US audiences etc, but it's still worth watching. Sean Connery's last big screen performance and he has some great one liners as does the Dorian Grey character. I'd say it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and although Alan Moore hated it, i think it's bursting with kitch fun.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
456,tango23,"hoped for more, but the movie was not up to it, so vote 3.",3,25 October 2003,"(warning: contains spoilers!)First of all, I haven't seen the comics on which this movie is based. Perhaps they are good (Hmm). Still, as I haven't read them, I will simply give the impression of the movie as if it was all by itself.Initially, as I read that the movie will have all the great fictional characters (well, not all of them, but a bunch), I thought that a cool idea.However, the implementation is rather abysmal:1) Jules Verne (the writer who created Captain Nemo) would turn in his grave, if he learned that somebody set Nemo, who hated British for opression and cruelty towards his home country India, working for British government and under direction of one of the personifications of British colonizers-adventurers - Alan Quotermain.2) the only purpose Tom Sawyer has in the movie, is to bring some American influence. The movie coming from Holywood it's not surprising, however, Tom seems to just be out of sync with the rest of league. Hell, he never was made that extraordinary by Mark Twain, he was just a normal boy.The same can be said for most of the rest of literary heroes and anti-heroes. The only one who was made good enough was Dorian Grey. As regards Moriarty, well... you can just remember Conan-Doyle describing him as a quiet professor of maths, a mastermind of crime, sitting quietly in his web etc. Well, here he is NOTHING like that.Probably it is the way the comics were written, and the movie dutifully reproduces it. This, unfortunately, does not make the movie any better.The crown jewel of the irony (which was perhaps even intended by the makers) is when Quotermain is dying in the end of the movie and he speaks to Sawyer to be sort of his heir, on the lines of ""the last century was mine, this one is yours"". I liked that. Sort of dark undertone, empires trading the world.I have the movie 3/10 for the special effects, which are decent, and for Dorian Grey, who is also decent. The rest is rubbish. The pace is supposed to be that of an action movie, yet for an action movie there are too many dumb conversations, trying to appear meaningful.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
457,paulg777,Extraordinary Fun,9,6 August 2003,"If you are seeking an original movie to watch (which is hard enough already), seek no further. This movie has enough characters to keep the whole thing interesting right up to the end. Particularly check out the invisible man's special effects, & of course Jekyll & Hyde was really something. Sean Connery as always is an A+ actor. This guy is just amazing. Watching this in the theater, you feel like you are transported to another time & place.

Other than the fact that the effects were poorly done, the movie had a good plot and the actors played their parts wonderfully. It also had some pretty funny lines and very good scenes.

459,caljeff,9 of 10 for the first 45 minutes...,7,31 August 2004,"I wish I could give different scores for the 1st and 2nd half of the movie. Excellent start for the first 45 minutes, but then it goes downhill from there and the movie wraps up to an unsurprising and unimpressive ending. Sean Connery was great as always, but the ""league"" includes many new actors and gets out of hand for the director to handle. The ""surprise"" at the end was somewhat predictable. Special effects were good until the Venice scene (again, good only for the first half). The DVD does have some interesting footages about how they shot the film, including why Connery accepted this role (he turned down The Matrix and Lord of the Rings before and didn't want to miss out on another potential blockbuster, even though he didn't really get the plot). Overall probably a 7... 9 for the first half, and a 5 at best for the second half... 10 for Mr. Connery's acting.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
460,Calina,not the greatest film,2,3 November 2003,"The idea behind this film was promising...but the execution left a hell of a lot to be desired. In some ways the near comic book quality of the backgrounds, eg Venice and London added to the film, but the acting was, in my humble opinion, appalling. It was just a failure across the board. I'm sorry it cost me six euro fifty to see.It's a pity because so much could have been achieved with it...it just looked like an idea with zero artistic direction. Implausibility needn't be a problem in a fantasy pic but I couldn't identify with any of the two dimensional characters, I am probably too close to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to escape a certain dis-satisfaction with the Nautilus and the list of stuff this film lacked is probably too long for anyone to make it definitive. Some people enjoyed it, I applaud them. For me, it shunts the Cradle Life into second place in the Worst Film I have seen this year, and God knows, that's a bit of an achievement.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Naturally, this resulted in my having somewhat massive expectations for this movie. The universe of the film and the background story is merely presented in the first five minutes, which, in relation to my expectations, was very disappointing.The story in The League of E.G. is so rapidly evolving that there can be concluded no harmony in this element, and it appears that the only reason for such an awkward universe, is the thereof deduced ""Victorian action sequences"". In these, however, the writers lacked as much fantasy, as to center the inventions-sphere on the Victorian age. Therefore we are presented to Nemo's automobile and flare-guided cruise-missiles, and of course the young American CIA-agent (!) knows how to drive as a Collin McRae...The idea for this movie had potency, the finished product is a brain dead, boring action cliche in an overestimated new setting.

I knew that it wasn't going to be a serious, thought provoking mind bender. All said, the movie was extremely enjoyable even though it was a bit light in the middle and lacking in character detail. Sean Connery is to be commended for his role in this film. For an actor of his caliber (not to mention age) to take the part offered to him says a lot for the premise of the film. To all of those who condemned this movie, I say, watch again. Only this time, without doting on every little literary detail.

You wonder if they did it on purpose - surely they knew that the story made no sense, and the amazing lack of continuity makes you think maybe they deliberatly made it this bad? You can see the ""twist"" coming from pretty much the opening scene, but the biggest flaw in this film is that you just don' *care* about anyone. You almost want the world to end just so you can leave the theater. But once the Gameboy-style special effects leave the screen and 2-dimensional characters finally walk away, you can't help but feel they messed up a promising idea.

I myself know a few of them like the invisible man, captain Nemo and Mr Hyde. I didn't know about the others like Alan Quatermain, Mina Harker, Doarian Gray and all the others.

It wasn't the best movie i'd ever seen, but the concept was pretty interesting and it did some things pretty well. Needless to say, like all people who defend this film, I had not read the comic. Having read it now, this movie just looks stupid. Every change from comic to movie made it noticeably worse, and there were too many changes. Extra characters are shoved in, so we none of them get more than 10 minutes of screen time, and this messes up the dates (shouldn't Tom Sawyer be about 60?). The plot is completely different, and somehow managed to travel through time to rip off Sherlock Holmes 2 (I would say it's the other way around, but that was a significantly better movie, and stealing from this would just be stupid), it also adds stuff that really doesn't make any sense (car chases in Venice?) and deletes one of the main villains (Fu Manchu) for no apparent reason (couldn't he have been kept instead of say, Dorian Gray?). One the bright side, this helped introduce me to the amazing comic. Unfortunately, a faithful adaptation would be almost impossible. The comic is an action/satire, and some of the references might be a bit too obscure. The movie was clearly dumbed down to the least common denominator, but that's the only way it could make any money. Also, filmmakers seem to think ""satire"" means ""it'll take itself completely seriously, but also be campy and not at all a satire"". So yes, its a pretty awful movie, but no, I'm not surprised.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
466,vnath_urala,Not a great movie,3,4 April 2005,"Though the LXG is a fantasy based movie of the unreal world, the quality of script and direction lacks to draw the viewer's attention and raise interest. Many of the Captain Nemo's dialogs have very deep meaning,which are at times too much to digest in one sitting. Before we wander of thinking what the character meant, there is another equally verbose dialog. Often there is a lapse of a second or two between two filming takes, which can be easily made out with the little pause of activity and then sudden activity in the switch between two takes. Fantasy! for kids there is too much to grasp and understand, for adults, there is too many directional pitfalls. Moreover, Allan Quatermain who does not seem to have such extraordinary power, as the rest of the crew, is given too much attention and then he is killed. That is sort of an anti-climax, no doubt the tribesmen resurrect him in the end. There is another pitfall which is of sort of genetic engineering related and cloning, with all of a sudden two of Invisible men popping up putting the viewer really in confusion of who's real. Do kids know of resurrection or genetic engineering or cloning? Leaving aside those aspects, how can anybody steal plans of the Nautilus so easily and then start a production center so soon, again fantasy? Isn't it too much!

Along the same lines as a film like Moulin Rouge. On one hand it is disappointing if your expectations are too high. To be fair though the film on paper looks like it should be one of the greatest films of the new millennium. But because our expectations were not met, does that make it a bad film. It does deliver on most of its ideas, with memorable characters. The action is pretty interesting, and the visuals are not bad for early 2000's.

470,sidereal,"Six...No, Seven, Characters in Search of a Plot",1,14 July 2003,"Make no mistake, I have nothing inherently against a postmodern hodgepodge of  well-known literary characters hanging out together and and fighting evil. I'm not so highbrow as to say that the premise itself of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is ill- conceived or some affront to the sources which spawned it. (I hear the graphic novel on which the movie is based is actually quite good.) I'm also a big fan of the increasingly popular ""comic-book movie,"" and was there on opening night of some of the most recent hits like X-Men United and SpiderMan. Those disclaimers out of the way, I would like to proceed to unreservedly pan The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as a movie of extraordinary crappiness.Sean Connery's portrayal of the adventurer-hero Allan Quartermain was more like a lifeless caricature of Ernest Hemingway. Yes, Mr. Connery is growing old gracefully, but grace shouldn't mean a downright sluggishness onscreen. He is often seen throughout the film staring, we are meant to assume in some kind of reverie, perhaps of his lost son or of the lonely horrors of an adventurer's life, but it comes across as a deadening gaze, one without purpose or meaning. The usually remarkable Mr. Connery is decidedly unremarkable here.Most of the main characters and their performances are largely unremarkable as well, which is, in a way, a kind of relief from the singularly awful performances given by Peta Wilson as Mina Harker (of Dracula lore) and of her love-interest Dorian Gray as played by. Mina sounds like a transvestite on valium as she chews up the scenery with her over-the-top drawlings of her (rather stupid) lines, and Dorian, whom we all know from Wilde's novel as a foppish dandy, comes across as some strapping uber-stallion who's tough as leather (and likely to use it). The two of them together generate no heat and no chemistry, as the actors are clearly too self-conscious to make a real connection. Their scenes, both together and separately, are embarassingly painful to watch.Speaking of embarrassing, the CGI used for the Nautilus (nice bling bling on that sub!) and for the change between Jekyll and Hyde is much too opaque for a movie with this kind of budget. And why is Hyde more like the Hulk, anyway? Contrast this sad attempt at SfX with the rather pathetic hairy attachment on Nemo's face that we're asked to believe is a beard. Come on, folks, this is Hollywood, not high school.And then there's the ""plot,"" which I'd mention in detail except there doesn't seem to be any.Cars in Venice? Dorian Gray is immortal? A submarine the size of the QEII in the canals? Run that plan about how to stop the bombs in the piazza de SanMarco by me one more time? What happened to the summit meeting? What exactly were the evil duo (character names intentionallydeleted) planning to do with all the personal effects of the League again? Voodoo?This movie hasn't got a leg to stand on, nor a canal to swim in. I don't mind things being unbelievable if they're extraordinary...that's what fantasy is all about and part of the reason we go to see movies like this. But when the extraordinary turns ridiculous, the only thing that's unbelievable is that I paid $10.50 to sit there through it.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

This cannot be! It *will* be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen!""Unfortunately, it wasn't.Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining way to spend 1.5+ hours. The special effects are good, the ways they dealt with the characters such as the invisible man (rather *an* invisible man... the *the* had died previously) and Jekyll. Captain Nemo I particularly enjoyed. That they created him as Indian was great and true to literature, and the grand scale of his inventions showed more of his brilliance.However, under the fizzle, there is nothing. Besides Allan Quatermain, we really only have inklings of ideas, if anything at all, as to why people did what they did. The movie's major shortcoming was character development and motivation. There was very little that made you feel anything for the characters. Nothing to tie you in, or to make their actions seem merited (or un-merited) because you just don't know enough about them.In the opinion of this reviewer, the bottom line is this: Entertaining for the time, and dissolves when you leave.

478,feebles_,Perhaps one must be familiar with the source material...,9,12 July 2003,"I watched The League of Extraordinary Gentleman last night and I was pleasant surprised by the film.  I was a touch concerned about the quality after seeing the questionable trailers, but I certainly wasn't let down. The film itself is one of the more potentially interesting films to be released this summer, thanks to its unique and fertile source material. Sadly, it does not draw upon the graphic novel as much as it could, but it still was a tremendously pleasing departure from the typically banal manufactured action/adventure films that moviegoers have to tolerate during the summer months.The most disappointing thing about the film is its PG-13 rating.  Not for the content itself, but by making the film so that it will meet the accursed MPAA's PG-13 standards, it damns itself to pretty good instead of great. The graphic novel was identified by its dark and grimy nature.  Alan Moore (the graphic novel's creator) populates his work with dark, troubled and, sometimes, downright wicked protagonists.  The story is rife with paranoia, suspicion and the dark stories are what make the graphic novel so appealing.The film is weak because it does not embrace Moore's dark Victorian Era, but rather makes the film seem much more light and pleasant.  Now, I can most certainly understand not recreating the horror of the graphic novel in the big screen (Skinner's introduction or Hyde's revelry in slaughter), but the film certainly would have been enhanced greatly if it added more of the source materials dark content that it did.  The filmmakers toy with it every now and again, but just when it seems to have becoming pleasantly dismal, it retreats back into well-lit standardized production again.The film is very literary as well and one might miss parts of the flim is they are not well read.  Regardless, the movie is still enjoyable and is valuable for its action/adventure content.  Action films that are actually watchable for more than 20-30 minutes are hard to come by as of recent and LXG certainly is enjoyable to watch for the entire film.  But much like Moore's last adapted graphic novel, From Hell, fans shouldn't expect 100% reproduction.  A lighter and friendlier version is what lies ahead, so be prepared.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
479,adamselene,Loved it!,10,12 July 2003,"ROCKED! It was a bit over the top, the CG wasn't perfect, but overall, it rocked. Take every possible classic fantastic literary reference (from Verne to Melville to Poe to any other you can think of) put em in a blender, add CG and lots of explosions, Mr. Connery doing his thing, generous humor, and you've got the League. They take quite a bit of character liberty, but who cares! If you're in for some entertaining action and some fun fantasy in a late 19th century timeframe, here you go. I'm not a big fan of westerns or noir, so this opens a new window in the period.  However, as my friend Alan noted during the film, it's an atrocious history lesson if you're not aware of reality, and the fictional backdrop for all the characters... but it's great fun at the same time.A little bit of background: It was written by Alan Moore, a pretty well acclaimed, mainly adult targeted, comic book writer. It's definitely a comic inspired movie. The pace is quick, the action is big, the characters are bold. The lulls are VERY short (think two or three comic pages), but just enough to let you take a break from the awesome action.  The characters are all classic literary icons.  Dr. Jekyll,  and Tom Sawyer are some of the more recognizable characters, Quartermain and Dorian Gray perhaps less so nowadays, but still huge.  Hopefully will inspire people to get out and read! =)I can't say much else about the movie without giving it away... the plot is pretty short, pretty obvious, and sewn up nicely in time, with plenty of room for a sequel with or without Connery (at his choice). I hope for one with Connery, but the man is getting too old for this stuff, to steal a line from Mr. Glover. To sum up, a very fun, very funny, grin on the face fantasy action movie.

481,mail-4707,Dire,1,1 February 2009,"Absolutely dire. One of the worst films I have ever seen. Awful, unbelievable plot. Laughable script. Terrible acting all round. I expect Connery is embarrassed by this film now. He is a Scottish nationalist so he must have found it difficult to say the dumb lines about helping England. Maybe that's why he's even more wooden than usual.The rest are no better.It's an absolutely absurd story. I don't care if it's true to the book or not. If it is then the book should not have been made into a film.The sets are often poor too. And yet when looking at some of the extras etc there must have been a fair amount of money spent making this nonsense. Shame.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

483,mcphatty88,People need to lighten up,10,13 July 2003,"This movie is far better than the critics will have you believe. First of all, the characters in this movie that have been presented as ""Super Heroes"" have a certain class to them that our current day super heroes lack. As usual, Sean Connery does a fine job as portraying Allan Quartermain. I don't remember when the last time he missed was. The suportting cast fits together quite well and they don't seem to get in each others' way to let the entire cast shine. I've heard from some critics that they wanted all of the characters to have been fully developed. In a day when movies are getting longer and more difficult to sit through this one would have matched ""Lord of The Rings"" in length. I also thought that the absence of harsh language was a pleasant change from every other action movie that hits the market these days. Another aspect that can be discounted is the camera work. People have said that they didn't like the ""you're there"" angles where the slight shaking of the camera gives you the sense that you're in the action. Well, it was only for the large action scenes and didn't take away from anything. I was very impressed by the vehicles that Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) provided for The League. Both the Nautilous and the automobile were magnificent.As far as negatives, it would have been nice if Rodney Skinner, ""The Invisible Man"" hadn't disappeared for such a long point in the movie. It did however create the ""twist"" of the unexpected that is always nice to have in a movie. Also the movie does hit a bit of a lull in the middle with some of the interactions between Sawyer (Shane West) and Quartermain. It definitely doesn't take away from the overall effect though.All in all this was a very well-done movie in my opinion. I don't think it will disappoint many especially if you like the idea of classic literary characters as heroes. Its not an all-time great but, it definitely warrants an above average rating. 7 out of 10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Besides, any movie with Sean Connery in it is in my own opinion a movie to watch. Sean Connery can take the worst movie script and make it interesting enough to hold the audience to their seats. I thought the NAUTILUS submarine was an interesting design and the first automobile looked like it could do a little 4wheeling.

487,Zombie_Mike,Worst movie of the year!,4,14 July 2003,"""How could a movie by the guy that did Blade be so horrible?"" As I walked out of the movie theater that's what I thought. And it's true, this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time.It starts out O.K., then just gets worse and worse with every scene, then finally when all the ""Extraordinary Gentlemen"" are recruited, I was already ready for it to end. But it kept going.The movie begins with some random guy trying to recruit Alan Quarterman, played by Connery, to help save the world. Quarterman says he dosen't want to help, a gunfight ensues, and then he changes his mind. They go to Europe (Quarterman was living in Africa) and finish getting the rest of the Leuge, after meeting with the aptly named boss, ""M."" Captain Nemo, Miss Harker (a vampire lady), The Invisible Man, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyl (who can become Mr. Hyde) and Dorian Grey are made part of the team as this pointless movie drags on for another half an hour. They all go on Nemo's ship (which looks nothing like Verne intended it to) and effortlessly go through the tiny Canals of Venice to stop a bomber. Quarterman and Sawyer take Captain Nemo's newest invention, the ""Automobile"" and save Venice. (Nemo never had a car).More pointless action happens. One member of the Legue turns out to be a traitor, and the rest follow him to some snow- covered place. More mindless action and the lead madman and the traitor are caught,(I'm not going to say who either are, it'll be a great surprise when you see it. Not) the lead madman was making huge weapons and wanted to start a world war, it's never mentioned if this would have any benefit for him, he just wants to.At the end, two of the Extraordinary men are dead, one of them is the traitor, the other is another surprise.There will then be a scene at a graveyard, where the living Gentlemen (and woman) are burying the dead one (not the traitor, he was ""cremated""), I don't know if this scene will make you as mad as it made me. This is the worst scene of the movie, it's painfully bad.If you want to see a good action movie, don't see this, save your eight bucks. This movie is NOT worth it. If you just want to know who the ""surprises"" are, search around on the 'net, someone will have something about within the week.

493,NeoNimbus,Extraordinary indeed,8,11 July 2003,"I read the critic reviews, and I have come to the conclusion that newspaper critics cannot give an action movie a decent rating. LXG is a really good steady paced movie with a few big Hollywood names and some huge literary names.  I found myself intrigued to find out more information about the names I did not recognize.  Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) makes a strong leader, and although his character was the most developed, I still want more.  The other characters were more  known to me, but a little less developed.  I Must Warn One Thing.  If you bought the book, either stop before page 110, or wait until you see the movie.  There are a few plot twists, and you will appreciate them more if you don't know about them beforehand.  Then, go home and finish the book so you can visualize in more detail.

This project probably started like this, and it sounded so enticing that the studio bosses gave the go ahead, and I went to see the film, but the idea just doesn't work. The result is much less than the sum of its parts. But credits are due to the arts department. The Nautilus was stunning, so was the automobile, and so were many of the settings.

Not to mention the fact that Shane West looked so cute as Tom Sawyer. I never thought he'd look good in blond hair. Anyway, bottom line is that this movie was really good. 3.5/4",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
496,tsiebert,League of Mediocre Gentlemen is more like it.,6,11 July 2003,"Read the comic book.  It's better.But  this movie is getting ripped by the critics, and it's not THAT bad.  It certainly has a ton wrong with it, yet it captures at least some spirit of comic books in general, though not the particular comic book from which it was adapted.Lots of reviews have knocked the performances, but I thought that was one of the best things about it (along with the opening Africa sequence).  I was against the addition of Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer, but the DG character was delicious fun, and Stuart Townsend's drolly dismissive delivery salvaged some bad bon mots.  Peta Wilson was well-cast, though her role was diminished in both narrative prominence and character from the book.  Others have said Connery was on autopilot, and at a couple points he seemed to be, but, (kind of like the movie itself), he had so much good will built up for me in the part that I just went with it and got a huge kick out of him.People also seem to be knocking the effects and art direction, but I thought they were appropriately comic-booky.Despite all the absurdities and lazy inconsistancies -- Giant sub negotiates Venice, vampiress in daylight,evil mastermind's ridiculously overblown HQ in Mongolia, no steam from breath in the cold, etc., etc. -- the thing that bugged me the most was how tightly framed many of the action sequences were; you couldn't tell what the hell was going on!  Never understood that style, though perhaps it's to mask the awkwardness of some actors abilities to fight.The critics are lambasting it, but I would have given it two stars (or a 5/10 on this page).  Plus, the general audience reaction, from what I could tell, was very favorable.  Some people applauded, and the family behind us was raving on and on about it -- mom, dad, kid, they loved it.The one thing the movie has going for it is that it's fundamentally different than almost all the other big releases this summer: It's not a sequel, it's not futuristic (well, maybe retro-futuristic), and it shows people a world they haven't really seen before.  It's certainly more fun than the dreary Hulk.Overall, it's a disappointment and a huge missed opportunity, full of good ideas that aren't pulled off, but it has enough going for it to possibly resonate with the general public.  I enjoyed it, but I went in WANTING to enjoy it, and I stubbornly held on to that view even as the movie got stupider and stupider.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
497,tsiebert,"Guilty Pleasure, but a waste of good ideas",6,12 July 2003,"Look, it's not good, but it's not torture, either.  The story zips along, the performances are extremely entertaining -- Sean Connery, Peta Wilson and the guy who plays Dorian Gray especially -- and the picture manages to capture some of the spirit of comic books in general, if not the particular comic book from which it is adapted.The opening in Africa is the best part, when Allan Quartermain is recruited, but there are other decent action sequences, though too many are shot tight and up close so you can't tell what the heck is going on -- annoying.  All the plot twists are for dummies and there a more holes and inconsistencies than I have space to describe.Still, I'm surprised by the vitriol of the critics; it's sloppy, but not a disaster.  The audience I saw it with applauded at the end and the family behind me was raving about it.It really has nothing to do with the original comic series its sequel, which is currently available and has one more issue to go], and isn't nearly as good.  But the central premise drawing these characters together is a great one, and it sustains the movie through a lot of its problems.

The thought of having all these characters in the same movie just made me cringe. however there were a number of elements that I thought saved the movie.as action scenes go, the movie supplied them with much gusto. almost never a dull moment, I was with anticipation for the next action scene to take away from this assemblage of literary marvels.As for the characters I thought some were explored a little farther than necessary, and others not enough. Dorian Gray (which is an excellent book) I thought had a little too much for my tastes. His character was great and the onslaught of savvy, cool, and ""immortal apathy"" as it were was excellent. I believe that having read the book I understood a little better than most. the fact that the entire background was explained annoyed me.most of the other characters were so so. I have always loved Sean Connery, even in his worst roles. His role as Alan Quartenmain fits the character perfectly. Who other to play on of the written word's best adventurers than James Bond himself.Togther the characters did absolutely nothing to help the movie in my mind. as separate entities I enjoyed them.I hope you enjoy the movie more than I did, but understand where I come from.Also, Correct me if I was wrong, but wasn't Nemo not Indian?",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I being amongst them. Having said that, I did hotly anticipate this movie just confirm my suspicions. I was however finding myself enjoying it.The plot is fairly simplistic in comparison to the graphic novel. As a side note I do see why the storyline was changed from the original; simply because the original is a subtle piece of work which requires much repeat reading, in a film that would just get annoying.Anyway, recruited to stop a madman, the cast who I wont repeat here, do a fairly admiral job of making the ""singular"" individuals shine in one way or another. Each cast member gets his/her defining moment of glory. Connery make Quartermain a man you can believe in, despite the material he has to work with. From the rogish invisible man, to the Kali-worshipping captain, from the awfully arrogant immortal to the dual personalitied Hyde the cast make characters difficult to forget. Even the added extra Tom Sawyer , has his memorable parts to play.Yes there are continuity problems, and there is some strange editing, and why they never change clothes is beyond me, despite the gunfire and knives. Then it occurred to me, this is based on a graphic novel, AKA a comic book. A character is defined by what he wears (or not in the case of the invisible man). The characters are based on classic literature, and so do not confirm to the norms of a person's imagination.All in all a good if flawed film.

This was not a movie that had the intention to be realistic, on the contrary, a movie full of literary characters, is not a realistic setting. So, don't criticize it on that level.

In short, the film is exceptionally well made. So what about my opening comment on story line? Well, a film that includes science fiction/horror literary characters such as Dorian Gray, Jekyll/Hyde, the Invisible Man etc., is clearly a work of true fantasy.

What was so great about the actions scenes were, that they were played out in such a great way, and they were very exciting. What I really liked about the Special Effects is the attention to detail, for example, the scene in which we are introduced to Captain Nemo's ship, and the sound effects that acompanied were awesome. Everyone gave great performances, and the story, which is what I really look for in a movie was interesting, and very emotional. I would actually like to see a Prequel to this movie, as I would like to see the events that happened before this movie, which are mentioned briefly by Allan Quatermain (Sean Connary) himself. My favourite out of the league has to be Captain Nemo, who was played brilliantly by Naseeruddin Shah. His fighting skills were spectacular. I really did enjoy this movie, and I recommend it to any one who is into the Action/Sci-Fi genre. I gave it a great 8/10.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
518,Rcs51998,Superhero movie for the literary lovers . . .,8,2 May 2005,"OK, first of all, to defend the movie against the first comment, Dorian and Mina had met before their first scene together; they had a past relationship . . . obviously . . . (scoff).I loved this movie. Sure the CGI's were obvious and the fight scenes may have been over-the-top, but come on! It is a movie full of these wonderful protagonists that all have defining qualities that add something special and intriguing to the group.Stuart Townsend, um could he have been anymore Lestat? Funny seeing his character act that way and play opposite a vampire.Connery was his usual brilliant self. The Tragic Hero.Shane West was great. Could have lived without his character, but West perfected it.Captain Nemo and Hyde/Jekyl were brilliant! Without their brains the whole group would have been in serious trouble. Hyde would be the Reluctant Hero here.And Mr. Invisible man himself was freaky enough for the freaky lot of them. I loved his character. He had you guessing from the beginning. Where is he? Who is he? Anyway, I know this movie received bad ratings, but I totally fell in love with it and its characters. I know there is room for a sequel, but don't think there will be one . . . sigh . . . but alas, I will always have this one.Makes me want to go read all the books involved in this brilliant compilation of great classics.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
519,Alex_Alexandria,Shocking,1,17 August 2006,"Now I watched this film some time ago, so forgive me if I am little hazy on the details. The one pervading memory I have of it is that it was shockingly bad and a misrepresentation of nearly all of the fictional characters concerned. I have not read the graphic novel so I cannot begin to make a comment on the how far the film strayed from that concept, but, as a fan of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, I feel I am well within my rights to highlight what a travesty of Mr Gray's character the film was. Yes it had him as a ruthless character that thoroughly enjoyed living a sinful life, which is all very well and good, but when it came to his demise I did feel rather let down. As I remember it from the film, Mr Gray was forced to look upon his own portrait at which point he died. WRONG WRONG WRONG. Mr Gray did have a portrait in the novel, but he revelled in looking at it and seeing the physical manifestations of his sins transferred onto it whilst he remained a flawless beauty - he himself stabbed the picture in the novel, which caused his untimely demise. It was painful to see such a beautiful literary creation mutilated for Hollywood profit.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
520,woofhound,Good fun,6,22 December 2006,"I bought this movie on DVD months ago but kept putting off watching it because of all the bad reviews. When I finally got round to watching it I realised that the problem was that too many fanboys out there were complaining that it wasn't the comic. Well it isn't meant to be.The acting is good, as you would expect of the cast, the plot perfectly fine, the action entertaining. On the downside the CGI is pretty ropey.Sure if you want historic accuracy you need to look elsewhere - but here's a point: Allan Quateman did not really exist.If you're a fanboy, avoid this and carry on reading the comics. If however you just want to waste a couple of hours of your life on popcorn entertainment, this'll do fine.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
521,solacesoulless,not so extraordinary....,3,27 February 2006,"Well first off, these guys aren't very extraordinary. I've never read the book but I would imagine the characters have considerably more depth - in this movie they're pretty stereotypical. We have the great white hunter, the hot vampire chick, the narcissistic traitor, the cockney thief everybody naturally suspects of everything but actually turns out to be noble and selfless in the end, the mysterious turban-wearing bearded guy (I don't know if he's supposed to be from India or where - and I don't think whoever wrote this screenplay had a clue either) who is also not surprisingly really good at martial arts and swordplay, the enthusiastic but inexperienced young American (grown up Tom Sawyer?! what the hell???), and a fairly standard rendition of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. Even the best filmmakers would have a hard time getting real depth out of seven main characters with such complicated back stories in the context of an action film, but this thing is just a mess. It tries to squeeze in bits of exposition in scattershot moments of tired flat dialog sandwiched between flashy action scenes and just ends up killing whatever pacing it could have had, while at the same time exposing each character's lack of depth.And the action side of things doesn't exactly make up for it. To me the effects look really fake. Not fake in a b-movie kind of way, but fake in a trying-too-hard, physics-defying way. It looks really slick and nice, and is actually quite visually appealing, but the bottom line is, it doesn't look even remotely real. And the way it's cut together in the scenes with the whole gang makes your head spin - you stop caring what you're seeing anymore, it jumps around so much. Again it seems like with so many characters, the director just couldn't decide who to point the camera at, so he points it at everybody in turn for about a millisecond at a time. It gets better once the team gets split up, returning to conventional action-movie territory in the fights with only a couple of protagonists to focus on. And the one thing that doesn't look so fake is surprisingly enough Mr. Hyde - better than the Hulk, I thought, but maybe that's because the skin tone is more normal, the face not so distorted. Actually I think Jason Flemyng, who plays Jekyll/Hyde, is one of the better actors here - aside from Sean Connery, who I guess you can't really say anything bad about, although he's not exactly what I would call, um, versatile.Then there's the plot. On the surface it might seem somewhat original, but it turns out it's not. Other people have already gone into the details so I'm not going to retread those waters, but I will point out a couple of trivial things that nagged me through the whole movie. When they're trying to catch Hyde and Quartermain is scolding Tom Sawyer for being a lousy shot, are we supposed to have forgotten about the part when Sawyer takes out each of the machine-gun baddies with a single shot in the midst of a hellish firefight? I guess we are, because from that moment on he seems to be a lot worse at hitting what he's shooting at. The other thing that bugged me was when Mina all of a sudden flies up out of the car - of course she doesn't exhibit that ability during any of the previous fights when it might have been useful, it's plainly just an invention for convenience, and to give her some screen-time. And she delivers such a flaccid one-liner to boot: ""save your bullets, these are mine"" or some such drivel. Ugh. Was that necessary? Horrible, horrible stuff.Anyway I suppose there are worse, more boring things you could watch, such as a pledge drive on PBS, but there are many other crappy movies I'd recommend before this one. Even if you like dumb action movies, it might be more than you can stomach. The effects are kind of neat-looking, but no more interesting than watching somebody play video games for a couple of hours. I wouldn't pay to rent it and I laugh at the thought of anyone actually wanting to own it, but if it comes on TV and there's nothing better on, knock yourself out!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
522,Markcooper666,Treat yourself and read the graphic novel.....,1,9 June 2005,"Any fan of Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel of the same name, cannot help but be bitterly disappointed by this film. However, for the sake of balance, and to hopefully avoid being written off as a fan-boy, I'll be considering this one as both a completely unrelated pop-corn action film (which it is in all fairness, given how closely it follows the source material) and as a comic-book adaptation.As a run-of-the-mill action film it is, frankly, pretty average. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is clichéd and hackneyed, the plot is utter nonsense and the performances range from being adequate to poor. Of course, given the type of film it is, all of this is to be expected. However, this film suffers from the flaws that seem to plague many glossy Hollywood pop-corn movies; it's slow moving, overlong and really does drag in places. For example, the lacklustre attempt to flesh out the relationship between Connnery's Quartermain and Tom Sawyer is about as emotive as a bowel movement and only serves to further slow the pace of the film; and when the 'payoff' for this pseudo father-son bonding is finally delivered I, and I suspect much of the audience, couldn't have cared less. So, it's formulaic, predictable and badly acted.Thankfully, it does have a few chuckle-worthy one-liners, reasonably well executed set pieces and plenty of eye candy- Jason Fleming's CGI enhanced performance of Hyde is definitely worth a mention. So, as a stand-alone actioner it's pretty average: 6 out of 10. You won't leave the cinema yelping for joy, or remember any of it in a few days time, but you probably won't be spitting blood either.But if you're a fan of the comic book do yourself a favour and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. The league of Extraordinary Gentleman is a brilliantly written, literary comic. Unfortunately, this seems to have been completely lost on the filmmakers. This film is utterly devoid of all of the subtleties and literary references that made the world of the League of Extraordinary Gentleman so enjoyable and absorbing. To be fair, the sets do make some attempt to recreate the steam-punk super-technologies of the comics; the Nautilus, for example, isn't too bad an interpretation. But set and costume design deviations are not what stops this adaptation dead. The real problem lies with the film-maker's utter disregard for the tone of the books, and the complete deconstruction of what was a cast of interesting and likable characters; the worn-out opium addict Quartermain; the cold and aloof Mina Harker; the brooding, morally complex Captain Nemo; and the completely amoral, self-serving Hawley Griffin (aka The Invisible Man). The only character who even remotely resembles their comic book incarnation (or indeed the literary source material- all of the original comic book characters are respectful interpretations taken from the original novels) is Jason Flemings portrayal of Jeykll and Hyde- although Hyde is still far removed from the sadistic madman of Alan Moore's books. This may seem like pedantry, but the reduction of these wonderful creations to two dimensional, utterly non-descript, action puppets is a travesty. This is compounded by the inclusion of Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer, neither of whom appear in the comics; notably, Tom Sawyer's inclusion seems to simply provide an American counterpart to the other English characters. And while Stuart Townsend's portrayal of Dorian Gray provides probably the only likable performance throughout, neither of the two new characters really add anything valid or redeeming to a predictable, nonsensical plot that bears no relation to the spirit or content of the graphic novels whatsoever.This film feels more like victimisation than homage. It succeeds only as a sad reminder of the crude, brainless treatment comic books regularly receive at the hands of mainstream cinema. The League of Extraordinary Gentleman is a wonderful piece of fiction, but in order to find that out you'll have to read it, instead of just gazing at the pretty pictures. It's obvious no one involved in this intelligence-sapping travesty of a film bothered. 2 out of 10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

On the other hand, I am a great fan of JRRT and carried plenty of baggage into those movies.Essentially, anyone going in to a movie about a book needs to take the movie on its own terms. LOTR was nice in many ways, but lost a lot in the translation. I still like it because it tried. I feel that LXG is similar. It set a good tone, had interesting characters and bits, and was consistent. Unlike something like Captain...and the World of Tomorrow (whatever the rest of that movie title was), which was flat, inconsistent, lacking in character, and generally wasn't much fun. LXG has a good mix of action, character, period fun, and concepts. And of course there's Sean Connery. The other actors a good, although N.

524,james_mcgowen2002,All Right but not as good as the original comics,4,8 July 2005,"My Dad got this film (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) as a birthday present this year, and I had previously read the original comics on which it was based, and even though I thought that it was not as good as the actual comics, it was pretty enjoyable. The film is about a group of actual ""superheroes"" created out of Victorian literature to form a group to save the world from a villain in the same style as with the Justice League and the X-Men. My two major quibbles with this film is (1) The graphic novels were set in an alternative world where all kinds of fictional characters co-existed. The film is not only based in the ""actual"" Victorian world, but got rid of the other references to other characters, by focusing on the major ones.(2) The main characters in the graphic novels were actually based on the actual descriptions provided by the original authors, and they also has some weaknesses to deal with. The film just twists them out of shape, waters them down a great deal, and adds other characters that were not written by Moore and O'Neill.Otherwise, the film was all right, and had some entertaining and humorous moments, and out of all the characters I liked were Quatermain, Mina Harker, Captain Nemo, Rodney Skinner and Dorien Gray.

525,koshka-devotchka,This film ROCKS!,8,13 February 2007,"It's a totally different story to the comic books, which I really like; it's more interesting than watching a version of a comic that's already been written. Dorian Gray was a great character, and I hope he comes into the comics somewhere. The only little complaint I have about the film is that Mina was pushed aside in favour of Quatermain to lead the League, and they turned her from a prim, acid-tongued lady into a feisty, basically horny vampire. Still, the vampire Mina rocked, so who am I to judge? I understood why they put Sawyer in, but he seemed a bit of a pointless character. Nice to look at though! If they make a sequel I reckon they should put Dr Frankenstein in, but not with the monster- maybe before he made it, or whilst he was working on the first theories.On a not-entirely-unrelated note, I want them to make more comics! Seriously, they cannot just leave it where they did! I will go mad, I tell you, MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD! *cough* Anyway, yeah, thanks for reading. Bye.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

527,nicholas1987,missed the point & sexist,3,12 June 2008,"The problem with this film, is that it missed the point of the graphic novel. I accept that films are not always faithful to the original source material, this is not necessarily a bad thing for instance V for Vendetta another film based on Alan Moore's work of the same name (not credited at his own request) changed many things, but kept the spirit and realised the point of the graphic novel and in my opinion even though I'm a huge fan of the graphic novel the film is better. With League of Extraordinary Gentlemen the point missed is that they don't start off extraordinary, they become extraordinary through there actions in the novel. Quatermanine starts off as an Opium addict (kids film questionable whether such addiction would be mention, although the original source material is not for kids with an attempted rape.) The only character who has problems is Jekyll. The sexism in this film is the replacement of Mina as lead character, making her a vampire rather than a strong independent woman.

528,danosu,Sean Connery still has it!,8,14 September 2011,"If you have watched The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, then you know what I am talking about in reference to what Sean Connery adds to a film in terms of star power and the accurate depictions of the characters he portrays. If you have not yet seen ""League,"" and would like to explore more of Connery's work in addition to it, I would suggest starting with Goldfinger (1964) - arguably the best 007 film, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade (1989), and The Rock (1996).Regardless, whether you are a longtime fan or newcomer to Connery's work, yet again with ""League,"" Connery does not disappoint fans of his typical style and panache. I'll be the first to admit that this is no 007 or Indiana Jones caliber screenplay or directing performance, but ""League"" is still memorable to fans of Connery. Connery shines in his depiction of the storied sharp shooter Allan Quartermain from the original folklore of H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines in the alternate reality setting that ""League"" creates, and steals the show.The majority of critics were overly harsh with this film, and were not likely in touch with the alternate fictional universe created by the writers and directors. The film was simply BASED on characters from various classic fictional sources, along with the comic/graphic novel series of the same name, and was never intended to represent those characters literally, so keep that in mind if you are well-read on the classics before watching this film.The special effects are very good, and will not disappoint most fans of action/adventure films plotted within a fantasy setting. Combine the effects with Connery's performance, along with the rest of the cast of characters that are quickly established, a plot that moves right along at a rapid pace, and you have an experience that will keep your attention throughout as the story advances.Despite the box office performance of ""League,"" it truly deserves a sequel with the full cast returning considering the loose ends that are left, which I shall not reveal. Watch the film and be the judge yourself! ""League"" deserved much more fanfare than it received, and is easily overlooked. For Connery fans, it may very well be his last full-feature film where he reprises a leading role. Currently at 81 years of age as of this review, he is certainly not getting younger, but has clearly enjoyed a very long and storied career that spans 7 decades!",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

League is just silly revisionist history, gratuitous violence, and various pathetic attempts at ""innuendo"" - all of which might be excusable if the adventure were...well, adventurous. The addition of Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray into the story is patently ludicrous, and Connery's comment ""You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray,"" only serves to make it more so, considering that the target audience (middle American teenagers) probably doesn't have a clue who Dorian Gray is.

The film never took itself too seriously (that's for sure!) and seemed content to be relegated to B-movie status. But it could have been so much better, had there been more character development and attention to detail (e.g. when Quatermain jumps out of Nemo's speeding car, he doesn't roll on the ground after landing, as physics requires, but instead lands flatfooted as if he'd just jumped off a stair).

539,Anomaly66,Campy and trite but fun nonetheless,7,30 March 2004,"When I first saw the trailers for League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I figured that it would go one of two ways.  It would either be a mediocre action film or it would be spectacular.  I placed most of my money on the first bet.  The fact that the theatrical release came and went entirely without me even noticing did nothing to change my expectations.I just recently had the opportunity to watch it on DVD and was pleasantly surprised.  LXG certainly wasn't anything amazing, but I thought it did manage to rise above complete mediocrity in a number of ways.  The acting was great, considering the source material, and I found I was able to keep my disbelief suspended for the most part.  The writing was decent and a number of lines deserved quotation after the movie was over.  The use of the invisible man as a source of comedy proved quite successful.  A couple of character devices proved, in my mind, quite interesting.  One of which was Dorian Gray's nature (which I won't reveal here), another being Dr. Jeckyll's battle with himself.Unfortunately this movie ends up being largely forgettable.  If only that worked such that subsequent viewings would feel like you were watching the movie for the first time.  There were a number of anachronisms that were obviously intentional but would have been much more impressive if they weren't so common.  Instead of making it seem like the movie was set in a period of history and because of ingenuity certain individuals had particular advantages, it seemed that the movie was set in modern times with a background of archaic spectators.  The tank was impressive.  The submarine was impressive.  The automatic weapons, the car and various other things were superfluous.LXG really needs a sequel.  This movie served to introduce the characters and establish their roles, but what they need now is a movie dedicated to a cause, much as X2 was exactly what was needed to follow up X-men.The bottom line is this:  If you are only going to watch 10 movies this year, LXG shouldn't be one of them.

I am an avid fan of a really broad range of movies, with a particular predilection for action oriented capers, but this one, despite high hopes, sinks effortlessly to the bottom of my barrel.Choppy story flow, underwhelming character introductions, painfully insipid dialogs and (maybe purposefully) cheesy special effects at times mark the debut of this league.  Very disappointing given the caliber of most of the actors on deck.  Sean Connery is a good choice for Indiana Jones' distant cousin, Allan Quatermain.  He, as usual, brings his inimitable persona and strong presence to his scenes, but you can't help but wonder if his rumored outbursts while shooting the movie were not justified.  And he's the character with the most to play with!!!Despite his hulking features, I actually enjoyed the Jekyll/Hyde character. His duality offered some really intriguing possibilities which were never fully explored or exploited.  The same applies to Mina Harker's blood-sucking cold beauty and the immortal Dorian Gray.  Truth be told, everyone does a decent job with their character within the confines of the movie's storyline, but they all end up like the Invisible Man, an empty shell with enough makeup thrown over it to distinguish the character.The writers (and producers!!) should have opted for a few less characters, better special effects in some scenes, and spent more time getting us to want to care about the rich and diverse cast of the league.  Maybe in the sequel, they should all just join Captain Nemo and the Nautilus and stay at 20,000 leagues under the sea, where they deserve to be...",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I love comic book style movies, and some receive poor reviews by people who probably don't generally like the style of these movies. I will buy the best of them to show support if nothing else. Some of my other favorite are The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai in the Eighth Dimension, The Adventures of Barron Von Munchausen, Hell Boy, both of the Spider Man movies and the Indiana Jones series. If you don't really enjoy this type of film, you should find something else to comment on. I dislike musicals, but I don't give a bad review to them, even though I watched them with my wife.

546,penance76,"I loved it, regardless of reviews!",10,13 July 2003,"I really enjoyed the movie, regardless of reviews or other people and their opinions. It was based on a comic book, so of course it was meant to be a little over the top, but I thought the effects and makeup were very well done. Granted, there were a lot of the effects, but none were horrible, I thought. Flemyng did a wonderful job, Connery was okay, the rest of the cast was great, though I was disappointed in Shane West, as it was a predictable move to have him be the 'son' figure to Connery and to include him for the average American audience who could recognize Tom Sawyer, but not Dorian, Mina or Prof. M. (I am from America...so I've polled my friends, etc to see if this was semi-true). I've read the original comic and was pleased to see some stuff come straight from it. I will be buying it when it comes out on video! I'm sorry so many of you didn't enjoy the movie, but really, there are much worse movies out there.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I'm afraid the adjectives in the 'Detailed Rating' columns above pretty much write the review for me.  A poor story, disappointing acting and visuals, and mediocre (at best) direction all add up to a barely redeemable film.  I'm obviously being generous with my overall rating as well - but I would hate to entirely discourage anyone from going to see this film.  We can all use a nice nap from time to time.  Someone may indeed find this film mildly entertaining, however I for one could find nothing 'Extraordinary' in it.  I hate being rude, but Mr. Connery's senility must be starting to creep in for him to have forgotten how incredibly dull the screenplay was between the time he read it and he called his agent to accept.  Either that, or he is hurting for money.  In either case, this film is far below an actor of his stature.  Consider the rest of the ""cast"" as proof of this.  At any rate, this is my first movie review and I must say I did enjoy posting it.  Perhaps the next film I see, I will actually take some notes while watching instead of trying to remember how it was.  Of course, it could just be that this particular film was in no way memorable?

549,BluesBrother03,"Good, but too chaotic",8,13 July 2003,"I was initially intrigued by the idea of a sort of AP Literature ""Justice League"". The idea is unique, and seeing Captain Nemo fight alongside Mr. Hyde was something. The film was just too clustered and chaotic a lot of the time. The graphic novel had a nice flow to it, with solid intros for each character and good chemistry within the team. With the addition of Dorian Gray and Tom Sawyer though, the movie never takes it's time with the story or character introductions. The film goes wrong in thinking that all we want to see is action and explosions, when really we want to see these characters interacting with one another. There is a scene when Allen Quartermain shows Tom Sawyer how to fire a rifle the British way. More scenes like that should have been added. But besides that, the film is good for escapist fun. I also admired the art direction. Some of the scenes are so close to the comic book look that they are breathtaking.

To bad nothing else in the movie backs it up.  This would make a good project for demonstrating what you can do with computers.  The forshadowing for Sean Connery was good, but none of the other important characters received theirs.  Then it suffered from overly fantasimal and improbable events that left you waiting for somebody to invent a terminator without a single weakness.(at least that movie was good)  I gave this movie a bomb rating.

Yes, the action sequences are a bit hard to follow due to the subdued lighting and speed...just sit in the rear rows of the theatre and you'll be fine. And pay attention!The parts described as ""slow"" by others are okay, and an appropriate change of pace. The characters are developed as much as is necessary  for an action flic; as they are already established characters in their own rights so more development is not needed.I enjoyed this more than ""The Hulk"", and give it 7 out of 10.

I have to admit that the basic premise of the film intrigued me greatly. It seemed to me, that with the modern cinematic special effects available, be it cgi, blue screen etc... This movie had all the makings of a winner. The only truly unknown quotient was the script.Boy did this one fail! A fairly talented and reasonably well cast ensemble were left out in the cold. Even the great Sean Connery couldn't save this turkey. The characters were denied any inkling of dimension, and were little more than cardboard cut-outs. The storyline was weak and so overly simplistic, as to make blank pages seem complex.The special effects, and action sequences were quite well done and having since seen the behind-the-scenes special feature (on the DVD) i would say they are quite commendable. It surprised me to discover that many of the best and most incredible scenes were not computer generated as you might expect, but created with painstakingly accurate miniatures,hydraulics and assorted old-school cinematic techniques.Unfortunately movies cannot rely on effects alone, and I am left to conclude that...This has got to be one of the worst films ever.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

You're going to be spending lots of time in the bathroom during this piece of trash, and if you're not the kind of guy who shells out $20 for drinks and popcorn, you're going to wish you were very quickly.The plot of `The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' set in an Alternative Victorian Age in 1899, revolves around the German Army who has harnessed technology of the future and aims to start a global war. The leader of the army, M (Richard Roxburgh), hopes to achieve global dominance by amassing large sums of money through the sale of these advanced tech products to both armies.To stop this from happening, a group of seven humans with extraordinary abilities forms. Led by the hunter Allan Quartermain (Sean Connery), the league also contains a vampire, an immortal, a beast, an invisible man, a spy, and a scientist. Director Stephen Norrington then proceeds to butcher literature by portraying Captain Nemo as a Muslim and Tom Sawyer as a spy.`LXG' soaks itself in action, but it's not the kind of action we want to see. What's the point of watching a battle if we know that every member of the league is practically immortal? In one scene, a solitary league member stands in the middle of a circular room as twenty men point their guns at him. Guess how the insignificant encounter ends.The film also shortchanges the view in the special effects department, with explosions looking more like zits popping. When league-member Dr. Jekyll changes into his alter ego of Mr. Hyde, there are four obvious gaps in the otherwise dynamic transformation process. Why not make the entire process one single shot?The movie cliché count skyrockets towards the midpoint of the film, with a classic subplot. Later, a soldier appears with a flame-thrower. Unfortunately, the movie shortchanges us yet again by not including a robotic ninja training camp in the cliché-filled ending. Definitely one to pass on.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

My least favorite novel character was Mr. Hyde, who came out looking more like the Hulk then Mr. Hyde. In a filmed that lacked quality it was contained too much special effects, which were not original and lagged on through out the film.

So if you're looking for a strictly fun action movie with cool special effects and explosions, it's probably good for you. And that's great.It would also be great if the people behind the story had actually paid attention to the literary characters they were using. I'm an Oscar Wilde fan, so I had a serious problem with how Dorian Gray was portrayed. It's OK that he doesn't look anything like the actual Dorian that Wilde created. It's less OK that they got his personality and most of the details about his life completely wrong. He isn't immortal. He just doesn't age. He can be killed. He's also not quite as aggressively evil as the movie would have you imagine. He's corrupt, idle, hedonistic, immoral, and generally not a good guy. But he's not the sort to be stealing boats and getting into knife fights. Also he's a very complicated character capable of doubt, remorse, and regret. It would have been nice to see them explore any of these avenues of his personality in the movie.I recognize that it's just an action movie.

The movie was only about an hour and 45 minutes long but I think they could have expanded the time slot for more character exposition. It was a bit corny in some parts but overall a 6.9/10.

And it still got worse.",1,22 July 2003,"As a near-obsessive fan of the brilliant Alan Moore and specifically his literary triumph ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", I was elated at the release of a movie by the same title.  Little did I know that the $100-million+ production was actually a secret plot against Moore and his fans, attempting to punish us for our love of witty dialogue and literary references!Director Stephen Norrington was clever enough to assemble a convincing cast to veil the inner workings of his torture scheme.  I am sure I was not alone in thinking ""Alan Moore story, Sean Connery in the lead--what can go wrong?"" Ah, Norrington, well played!  It is as if you hypnotized my own lap dog to attack, not knowing its own evil nature.  The trick is elaborate: the actors are convincing, the sets show the ridiculous sums of money lavished on them, and yet somehow, it is the worst movie ever made!  Magic!The first hint of things going awry is the venue shift from London to Venice, which is not the ""Venice, Italy"" you may be familiar with, but a parallel universe that is outwardly similar but without any logic or reason behind it.  As the story slowly peels away levels of horror like Satan's onion you see that Norrington is scorning Moore's fans by directing them film at the greater audience: total idiots.As each character is introduced, with names that should be familiar to anyone over the age of 12 living in the modern world, each individual audience member is smacked over the head with a baseball bat and shaken vigorously to remind them that these are people from other movies they may have seen, or perhaps favorites from Classic Comix they were forced to read when Mom and Dad forced education on them.So much time is spent establishing who these people are that there would be little time left for plot, that would be, if Norrington had bothered to write one.  Instead he opts for a selection of fight scenes using weapons that span 100 years of technology not yet discovered and the occasional TV-movie side-plot about fathers and sons and relationships that hurt.I believe the movie went on for several hours, although I can't be sure--after they re-located to Mongolia I stabbed my eyeballs out with the spoon-straw in my Icee.  Unfortunately the blood loss was not fast enough to render me unconscious and I had to endure further hours of pained dialog and awkward reminders that these are ""famous characters"" and that somehow this fact should substitute for their doing or saying anything of interest.My companion at the torture session, I mean screening, tells me that the ending involved a dancing shaman, but I think he must have fallen asleep and awoken during an Oliver Stone film.  Either that or the horrors of ""LXG"" sparked a psychotic episode to defend his sensibilities.I look forward to Stephen Norrington's bright future with whatever government he decides to work for.  With torture methods like these in his arsenal he will be a valuable asset to any emerging fascist regime.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Also in Paris where they find Jekyll they use Mina Murray as bait ( prostitute ) to find him. Also Jekyll gets his ear shot right off.There are many ore things that are different from the graphic novel that i would have liked to have seen in the movie. But I'm not the director so i can live with it as long as they make another and bring back Quatermain.

I told everyone I knew about this great comic being turned into a movie. I was subsequently crushed as hollywood worked its magic once again and turned what could have been a classic movie into a vile mess. The addition of characters and the exclusion of seedy addictions really is just the tip of the iceberg as far as flaws go. I was deeply saddened by the poor execution of this movie.

I know I need to back up a statement of this magnitude, but if I wrote everything I hated about this movie I would die typing.  I'll stick to all the things wrong with The Nautilus.  The ship is initially shown as about the size of an aircraft carrier and somehow navigates the narrow Venice canals with their 90-degree turns and low bridges.  One shot of the ship shows a person on the deck and the height could be estimated at about 75 to 100 feet off the water.  It also has cruise missiles on board that are able to target a car that is also owned by Captain Nemo -- it gets better.  The ship is able to travel very fast and leave the people up on the deck with a light breeze on their faces instead of gale force winds.  It's powered by two tiny drill-looking mechanisms that wouldn't work worth a crap (I'm a mechanical engineer and have had classes in fluid dynamics - they could've used propellers at least to make it believable).  What rotates these drill engines?  Why solar panels of course that can charge up according to the Capt. Solar panels cannot charge or retain energy; they only collect energy.  There are no redeeming qualities in this movie.  I've read Ebert's review of this movie and it is completely accurate and in some ways too generous.

570,InTrance,there are worst things to see,3,17 September 2003,"_Not what I expected!_Yesterday, 16th september 2003, I saw LGX. My expectations where quite high. The cast looked good, story looked promising, but that doesn't mean the movie is great to watch obviously!The movie started by immediately letting know that this is a fantasy movie, and that we don't have to expect a lot of scientific-correct things. The movie plays in 1899, and the world is on the edge of a world war, due to ""phantom"", who want's to make a profit of it. We see him, and his army with automatic guns, driving trough London in a tank, and driving into a bank where he steals all the gold.
Then we move to Africa where we meet Allan Quatermain. he is persuaded to help ""the British Kingdom"" and prevent a world war. Allan Quatermain agrees to help, movies to (rainy) London and meets part of his team, that consists out of Nemo (20.000 Leagues under the sea), Mina (Vampire), Skinner (The Invisible Man), Dorian Gray (unmortal), Tom Sawyer and Dr. Henry Jekyll aka Mr. Edward Hyde / The Hunchback of Notre Dame.This movie has a lot of references to other movies/books. Even the bad guy turns out to be a well-known person: Mr. Moriarty (the bad guy in the Sherlock Holmes books/movies). Also there are other references, like a reference to ""Around the world in 80 days"".I guess they tried to make the movie easier to watch, but I don't think they succeeded. The movie was more something put together then one total thing.Besides that, the computer-generated graphics (CGI) were terrible. They used a lot of CGI, but they looked like they were really fake. They didn't seem real at all. The Nautilus is a great example. Even for someone who likes fantasy (like me) it was a bit disappointing! There are many other movies that DO know how to make great CGI imagery... learn from them I would say!My conclusion is this: I didn't liked LXG at all... the crew was good, but it didn't worked! There were to many different identities, who all had to do their own thing. It was too much for that movie. And the CGI imagery, what is kind crucial in now-a-days fantasy movies, was of poor quality. The ending of the movie was also kind lame IMO. When Tom want's to shoot Moriaty, Allen says, ""Take your time"" (reference to the beginning of the movie). Tom takes his time... hoots Moriaty, Tom looks to Allen, and Allen dies.As last scene we see an African funeral... with something that could be a reference to a sequel... do we have to see an other LXG movie soon??

The premise itself seems loaded with potential as did the movie itself. Minutes are spent with the Hyde character and his internal battle with jekel and the horror he might unleash but when he finally does transform (terribly) He turns into a mild mannered retard with paper mache Log arms.

The bad reviews are understandable, but keep in mind that it's coming from people who don't enjoy really good stories (OH they'll insist to the death that they do). I've even seen a split amongst the community of el geekos, but I find it seems to be an even split between the rationals and idealists (the idealists being the LXG/Alan Moore appreciators).Although this film has all of the typical hollywood blockbuster trimmings, it is a diamond in the rough.  Here's the ticket:1.  Read the reviews and have pity on their authors 2.  Go to the movie with someone you like 3.  Sit back and enjoy a supremely crafted story that could only be imagined by a great literary mind. 4.  Don't get all tight about plausibility...This is definitely going to be a classic.  ""Leagues"" better than X-Men, but X-Men was made more for the candy eaters.. LXG OTOH is some good meat...Chin, chinmrgray",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
577,mokeysue,The Year's Best Comedy,4,12 July 2003,"As an avid and knowledgeable fan of Jekyll and Hyde, I found myself at the opening night show of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I must admit, I knew nothing about any of the characters except Jekyll/Hyde. Having read several ""rotten"" reviews on rottentomatoes.com, I had set out to prove the critics wrong. When Hyde was finally introduced, I overlooked the appallingly amateurish CGI and chose to focus on Jason Flemyng's portrayal of the duo Jekyll/Hyde. Flemyng's accent is too low-class for his well-educated character, but physically, Flemyng's Jekyll fits the mold of the exhausted and drained good doctor. Besides the character development (non-existent), the members of the League are given next to no introduction to the film. For viewers unfamiliar with the characters, as I was, piecing together the bits is too much work and could be easily remedied with a proper introduction. After Hyde acts heroically, saving the lives of thousands (since when does Hyde care about saving people) I gave up. Refusing to ignore the string of discontinuities (leaping out of moving cars unscathed, clothing magically restoring from scene to scene), I spent the rest of the film pondering the hilarity of it all. Maybe the film's intent was not to take itself too seriously, but in the end, it comes off looking ridiculous. The film refuses to redeem itself, and ends with absurdly and abruptly. Whether you're a fan of 19th century British Lit or just good movies, this film will disappoint you.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
578,lizabethy,Entertainment purposes only--great escape,9,12 July 2003,"I think this was a terrific movie!  It was definitely not ""artistic,"" though I heard Sean Connery was constantly fighting about the artistic ""flow"" or something, lol.  No, it was purely an escape film.  I was highly entertained.  There was plenty of action, humor, a tiny shot of romance (real romance would have been severely misplaced), visual stunners, eye candy (Connery, of course, and Shane West...even though they're a *cough* couple of generations apart), and more.  There was a lot going on and not a whole lot of plot, but the fast pace was refreshing.  The substance was in the attention to detail, subtle humor, and terrific performances.
My main complaint is the invisible man...he just didn't seem to fit in really.  He definitely had his moments, and seemed to be purely for comic relief, which worked fairly well.  Of course they had to make the jester a hero, but hey, that's why it's called an escape.  The other complaint is the often hokey dialogue.  I mean really...""I've lived long enough to see the future become a past..."" (or something similar--yes I'm paraphrasing). That's not original criticism, I also saw that in newspaper review, but it's definitely not the only example.  I'm just not particularly good at remembering exact dialogue.All in all, a movie worth seeing.  If you're not too excited about it, wait for the video, but the visual aspect of the movie (impressive wide shots, the huge ""ship"") is enough for me to recommend plunking down the $6.50 (or whatever) and going to the theater.  Just sneak in some homemade brownies and a juice box.  :-P",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
579,jedirn13,not to bad..but could be better,7,13 July 2003,"After reading several of the other comments and having seen the movie, i would have to agree with most.  the movie did seem to leave a great deal out about the characters and the action scenes did go to fast to be seen real well. The acting was not terrible, but then not overly great either.  Of course Connery did great as always..of course he could make a Depends commmercial seem exciting. I had just seen the Pirates of the Carribbean the day before and found it a bit more enjoyable.  But I would still recommend this movie to my friends but probably only after the recommending the Pirates first.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
580,amason0623,An Extraordinary Bore,3,15 July 2003,"(spoilers within)It is only extraordinary in its blandness and implausibility.  Scenes that are meant to thrill do nothing but; the packed house of Saturday evening moviegoers with which I witnessed this waste of celluloid sat through the movie with barely a chuckle or a gasp.  One can only suppose this is also a reflection on the ease at which the audience accepted a Titanic-sized vessel successfully navigating the canals of Venice, or a souped-up 1930s automobile meandering through London when it belonged in Shanghai during the opening scenes of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  And the blase acting is more suited to any George Lucas picture of the past 17 years.Watching two hours of Ron Popeil informercials provides more thrills than this so-called ""action-adventure"" movie.  If you have HBO, Starz or Showtime at this time next summer and find yourself unable to sleep, find a channel showing this movie and turn it on.

581,bcat333_99,1 or 2 interesting characters save film,6,14 July 2003,"Guess I'll just put a spoiler alert first off, to play it safe...***SPOILER ALERT***Okay, Not a great movie, but not terrible either, it is rescued by a couple of intriguing characters.  The emphasis of the movie seemed to be on the special effects, which was a mistake, as some of them were good, but some fell VERY short of expectations.But getting past that, the characters are what ultimately sell or sink the movie for me, and thanks to the wonderfully amoral and ambiguous character of Dorian Gray, I was actually intrigued.  I wanted to know more about him, about his history with Mina, etc...  Stuart Townsend gets a huge thumbs up from me for his performance.  And as a result of his interaction with (and implied history with), Mina Harker's character is given a depth and emotional complexity that she would otherwise have lacked.  The two played convincingly well off each other.  Sean Connery's character is pretty good, but the attempted father/son vibe between him and Tom Sawyer felt too forced to be emotionally effective.Had less emphasis and screentime been given to special effects and more to character developement, this would have been an even better movie.  What Stuart Townsend was able to do with Dorian Gray's character had me secretly rooting for him despite the fact that he ended up betraying everyone.  I was disappointed that he died in the end - I wish he'd been able to survive and smirk his way into the sunset.  Despite being amoral and leaning more toward evil, he was the most interesting character of the bunch, and if a sequel is made it's a shame he (presumably) won't be a part of it.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I was surprised when I read the reviews on IMDB . . . after the fact. This is the first review I've written for this site, but usually when I watch a movie I go here and usually what I think is right around what is given to the movie, I give this movie about a 7.5-8. Not as good as Pirates, but still a fun movie, but I never read the books, or comics, but I think people seem to be taking that too seriously. They remind me of 'Comic Book Guy' from the Simpsons. I kind understand the whole book-movie ratio. It never adds up. That's why I don't read.(kidding) Anyway, I have read Spider-Man comics since I was young and can see being critical of anything that might tear that stuff up, but I really enjoyed this film, so don't be scared off by the guys taking it too seriously, it's a good fun film.

However, as I am fond of remembering, these are the same papers whos critics gave Star Wars (the original one) 2 thumbs way down.  I therefore went disregarding their opinions and was very happy that I did.  Full of subtle references to books, authors and movies it was almost like reading a kids ISPY book.  They even threw in a few James Bond things like naming the coordinator of the League ""M"" and giving the turncoat a golden gun as in Goldfinger.

The plot was fun, the acting was terrific, and the action was exciting.I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

Thereby I have no reason to get bent out of shape by that fact.So with fresh eyes to the story I would have to say that Connery may not be at his best, but certainly does a good job at the role. The teen idol who plays agent Sawyer looked and acted too young for me to believe he was an agent. But if you are good at suspending disbelief this is a great summer Sci-fi flick.

This movie was one of the better comic book adaptations I've seen this year (i.e., Hulk, Daredevil, and X-men). I enjoyed the dialog with the understanding that a movie must develop a character. Hopefully, LXG2 will get right into the plot instead of spending too much time on each person. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the Mr. Hyde character the most.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
590,harrygg2,Go League!,8,18 July 2003,"When I first saw the trailers for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, I was both excited and apprehensive.  Being an avid fan of the comic book (by Alan Moore) upon which League is based, I was curious to see whether the film would remain true to the spirit of the comic, or whether Hollywood would just totally run roughshod over it. I have now seen the film and am not just relieved, but elated.  Yes, there are departures from Moore's work, but that's to be expected and is certainly not uncommon (look at the Spider-Man and X-Men movies if you don't believe me).  However, the general spirit of the comic is retained, and the personalities of the characters in the film are, with only a couple of (understandable) exceptions, dead-on in line with those of the book.  Not only that, but the movie does a perfect job of capturing the ""old-fashioned futuristic"" feel of Moore's work, from the settings to the technology.  In fact, my only complaint is that a little too much screen time was devoted to Quatermain (Sean Connery) at the expense of the other characters--a pity, as each one of them (with the possible exception of Sawyer) truly is extraordinary and very much worth exploring in-depth.Overall, I found this film cool, quirky, and utterly enjoyable.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

As for the others - sloppy is the best word I can think of to describe the performance.3.  Special effects - none.  Nothing special happened.  Watching a bullet fly in slow motion for 500 yards ... but other than that, mostly B-movie knock-offs - buildings blowing up but no debris in streets, and so on. Lots of people shot, only one instance where there was blood, etc.4.  Gaffes - plenty.  Windows on walls of submarine when viewed from inside, none when viewed from outside, people jumping from speeding cars and landing flat-footed without any inertial effects, etc.5.  Stunts - only a couple.  About the only neat stunt effect was done with computer when the vampiress jumps up the building from the car.6.  Plot - trite.

595,kjandca,"Great beginning, Overdone ending",8,2 August 2003,"First off, it's always a pleasure to see Sean Connery on screen. As Steven Spielberg once said, Connery is one of the last true movie stars working in the business. His presence, even is a mediocre film, can make it one well worth watching. Such is the case of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". Like John Wayne, Connery is still a credible action hero well into his seventies. The world-weary Great White Hunter Allan Quartermain of H. Rider Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" is a prefect fit for the former James Bond. The reason Connery's Bond is still considered the best is because he gave the impression that really enjoyed getting down and dirty confronting ""unspeakable evil"". That's why Connery comes off so well in this movie, he seems like one who has enjoyed being down and dirty for a few too many years.If everything in ""League"" could have been as good as Connery this would have been one for the year-end ""Top Ten"" lists. For the first two-thirds of the movie, it seems like it might be the case. As a science-fiction film, ""League"" requires a lot of suspension of disbelief.  Unfortunately ""League"" - as well as just about every other science fiction film being released these days - just can't figure out where that line between suspension of disbelief and just plain bad screenwriting lies. For the first hour that "" League"" stays on the ""suspension of disbelief"" side of that line, it's one hell of a popcorn munching movie.Some unemployed code writer in Silicon Valley should spend his time off doing Hollywood a huge favor by coming up with a science-fiction screenwriter's software program. The main feature of this program would be to warn the future Harlan Ellison when he's in danger of crossing the ""suspension of disbelief/bad screenwriting"" line by asking challenging questions like ""OK, I can accept automatic assault rifles, guided missiles, and a 1930's vintage automobile in a movie set in 1899 but how can a huge submarine like the ""Nautilus"" - almost as big as the ""Titanic"" -  navigate the Thames into London, the canals of Venice and upriver into Mongolia, even while submerged? Didn't know those canals in Venice were as deep as they were smelly"".Such software would have saved ""League""  from Hollywood's typical reaction to crossing the ""suspension of disbelief/bad screenwriting"" line - Special Effects Overkill. While reading the ending credits, I lost count of how many SFX firms were employed by the producers of this film. Most of that money and effort must have went into the final 45 minutes of this movie. It's too bad that software to warn film producers where the line between audiences being thrilled and pummeled is beyond ""suspension of disbelief"". The pummeling wouldn't be such a glaring admission of failure if all those SFX weren't something audiences haven't seen many, many times before - this summer. Special effects are easy - good screenwriting is hard.Aside from Connery, two other members of the cast stand out. Naseeruddin Shah is an inspiring choice to play Captain Nemo. Although he probably won't make one forget James Mason, casting the role as an Asian Indian instead of a European is a bold move and Shah portrays Nemo with authority andmysteriousness as opposed to Mason's authority and madness. As WilhelminaHarker, Peta Wilson is not only gorgeous but quite convincing as victimizerinstead of  the victim in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"".All in all, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is not a bad way to escape the summer heat for a couple of hours. It's good points - Connery, Shah, Wilson, the set design, the cinematography, a really cool ""Nautilus"" - just about save it from the bad - the SFX free-for-all in the last 45 minutes, Mr. Hyde's cheesy Hulk impersonation. With a little restraint and another trip or two through the word processor, ""League"" could have been so much more.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

It was a suprise to see him in an action scene.I also loved the way all the characters integrated with each other, as if they lived in a common era and in a common place.

about the negative reviews(some spoilers):There is alot of negative reviews and alot more of ""This movie Sucks!"" on the forums. But alot of people enjoyed this film as well so rarely have I seen a movie with such devided opinions.LXG is a action movie based on the comic book of the same name by Allan More. Allot of critics say the book dosen't follow the comic book faithfully well this is true. But in the movie creator's defence this is a pg-13 movie and in the comic book by Allan more we see the Invisible man raping young girls in a convent, Quatermain dependant on drugs and many other situations that would have made such a movie a rated R movie.The acting was good for an action film, also all of the league memebers are based on charactors from litrature. Sometimes to understand a part in the movie you have prior knowlege of that perticular charactor.
Like Mina (from bram strokers dracula) she is a vampire(in the movie)and walks in day light. But in Bramstrokers Dracula walks in plain day light as well because in  bram strokers dracula vampires are only weaken by the sun not destroyed.Also, the universe in the movie is our own but history is changed, so in this alternet earth the city of Venice has roads next to the Canal and the canals can be deep enghouh to accomdate a submarine, Nemo can have created an automobile...etc etc...Some people noticed similarities with steampunk type games, while not quite steampunk the movie does have some resemblance to the steampunk style.In conclusion, I belive this is a a very good action film and it has to be treated as an action film where the charactors are complex yet the story is simple. This is a movie you watch when you want to see a movie where the bad guy is evil and the good guys are good.8 out of 10",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I know I'm a little late reviewing but I just read an article that stated this film was the reason Sean Connery retired from acting.....if true, douche move Connery.

Half way through the movie I didn't know what was going on, because they never clearly explained anything well, but that's okay, because I didn't really care! It was so boring. I found nothing engaging about it, nothing! I really wanted to like this movie, but it was so hard to! I love Sean Connery, I do, but this is one of his worst performances.In the end, very interesting concept, but don't be deceived! This is a very bad movie.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
614,cmscott27,Cool concept for a movie.,10,5 May 2004,"I think LXG is a very cool concept for a movie. Bringing a handful of Victorian Era characters together into one movie. Instead of having one key character why not have seven characters that play an equally  important role. I remember the last movie that had a handful of key characters. Hmmmm Can you say Lord of the Rings? That seemed to do well with the public. LXG spells sequel regardless if it flopped in the box office or not. Overall ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is a very good movie with a twist in the middle and a typical superhero plot of saving the planet from world domination. Very cool special effects as well. I rated this movie a ten.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

It wasn't even thought through properly and there were numerous mistakes made. I bought it from ""Cash Converters"" for £4.99 on 2 disc DVD and I thought it was hilarious. I would say that it's a bodge job by the director as the graphics, acting and script was absolute batty. Here is a list of all the mistakes that I noticed:1.Since when was Dorian Gray invincible? 2.When Dorian Gray was shot, not only did the bullet holes on his chest disappear but the holes in his jacket also disappeared3.While the bloke poisons himself during the start of the film, the people around him appear and disappear in between shots4.Since when were the bridges in Venice so high?5.How the heck did the ship manage to turn in the Venice Canals?6.Was no one aware that there are no streets in Venice?7.When they make the computer generated invisible bloke, only the front of his face has cream on but you can see when it's the actor when the invisible bloke has cream round his whole head8.You can also tell that they wanted to be simple when they gave the invisible bloke glasses so that they won't have to give the actor terrifying eyes 9.There is a graveyard in a city that is infamous for its burials at sea10.When Quartermain is dead in the corner, he is still breathing and opens his eyes11.When the bloke at the end is running through the snow with a suitcase, it changes from his left hand to right hand12.When the tables on the boat fall to the other side, they are being pulled by strings13.There is a vase on the Submarine and you're not allowed a vase because it will smash14.The workers on the Sub are picking up glasses off the floor which should have been smashed15.At the start the tank breaks through a wall and a policeman actually believes that it will stop for him because he's got a bat in his hand16.When the tank is going through the bank, the guards try shooting the wheels, expecting them to deflate17.The clothes that Nemo wears do not follow with his religion18.That vampire woman's hair changes from curly to straight in between shots19.When that terror Hulk bloke is under water he emmits no air bubbles20.Please Visit """"CASH CONVERTERS""""",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

I wanted to see it because I have read all the books these characters were based on. It's not my favorite movie, but I didn't hate it. On it's own, without comparison to any other book or movie it brought a smile to my face.My 2 biggest complaints were 1. Hyde was such a bizarre shape. Again, the DVD said it based his ""larger than life size"" on the comic book, I based my opinion on the original book. 2. What was Mina doing out in the sunshine? In the original novel Dracula, where she comes from, none of the vampires go out in the sun. But I thought Dorian Gray was exactly as I had pictured him in the book. I guess everything is a matter of perspective. I based my opinion on the original books. I liked the idea of what it would be like if these fictional characters got together.

I guess Sean Connery is getting old, perhaps even desperate for work, to take on this stinker. The Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde character was completely over the top. It obviously had a good budget--the sets were intricate, etc., they just needed to spend more time on the writing: dialogue and plot.

I am a teen and I thought that other than minor flaws, this action packed movie was great! Sean Connery was wonderful, as in all his performances, and Stuart Townsend melted my butter! I could only wish that the relationship between him and Peta (Mina Harker), would have been more captured on screen. I know it's an action movie but I think a little more hot and heavy action would be very appreciated to balance the guns and gore. A little more background info like flashbacks would have helped on knowing who the characters were but that doesn't really happen with other comic flicks so I'm OK with that.My only sadness is that I doubt that they will make the sequel that would fulfill my craving for this movie( I watched it many a time).

I will beat on it because it swims in the same cesspool as so many other big budget action films. The ""action"" scenes are so full of cutshots they are impossible to enjoy. The characters have no sense of reaction. We are treated to Ms. Harker sucking the blood of an enemy. All the men folk do is act slightly put off and then are unconcerned that one of them is undead. Apparently they're fully familiar with each others' exploits (at least as far as Nemo, Quatermain, and the invisible man are concerned) but have never had an inkling that such things as vampires exist. Next they have no reaction when Mina turns vampire again and starts to fly around with her bat brigade whereas when Dorian Gray gets shot up, there are gasps aplenty. How about when the hotel in Kenya gets blown up? Quatermain moans about the people he lost in his life but when the place blows up he doesn't react at all to the loss of the people in the bar whom we're led to believe he was friendly. And we are to believe the Nautilus displaces no water whatsoever when it surfaces or cruises the Venice canals? Just slipshod stuff.I like to have my disbelief suspended, believe me.

Even if you don't believe in the myths involved, if you just sit back and enjoy the fantasy & imagination of the movie -- you will have a great time. I know a lot of people don't think of Sean C. as anyone but 007, but he has a way of taking that character & adding it to all his new ones. Well, he once again succeeded. And the others involved? Well, lets just say I was impressed. The surprise on the betrayal, the change in attitudes of some characters, and the unity in the end  very impressive. Obviously the timing is off somewhat, but who cares? I think the mix & match of it all made the film even better. I have talked to some who think the opposite & even have said that the mix and match makes it too confusing. My question is  how?

However the movie feels slow and uneventful. Characters are not fully explored or backgrounds explained. Watching you feel each character is missing something from their lives, e.g. Dr Jekyll seems to want to find love and Sean Connery character misses his lost son. However the movie never focuses on these aspects, which I found frustrating. It mostly follows the plot of chasing the bad guys around the world. There is no real drama or madness in the plot. It is not helped by having no emotional connection with the protagonists.
The biggest enjoyment was the set designs and style of a British Empire steam punk world. However, this was only noticable due to the uneventful plot.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen

Also, Sean Connery and the guy who played the Invisible man were excellent too! I loved Rodney Skinners character- he brought a 'touch' to the movie. The ending left me on the edge of my chair- what happened? I thought this movie was great and I'd definitely see it 100 times more! Peta Wilson was great- but I don't thinks he really got into her role as much as she could. I must admit- when Grey turned out to be evil I was surprised! It was an excellent twist in the story.

When I want plot, I'll look elsewhere, but sometimes mindless entertainment beckons, and when it does, nothing satisfies like a fun action movie. There was not a whole lot of need for in depth thought with this movie, and the ""plot twists"" were evident enough to make even the most dull of people feel as if they had just caught on to a master plan.This movie was not high art, and was obviously not intended to be.

To stop him, England forms the LXG, headed by Alan Quatermaine. The LXG consists of Dorian Gray (who is immortal), Mina Harker (a vampire), Tom Sawyer (good with guns), Rodney Skinner (The Invisible Man), Captain Nemo (amazing transportation - the Nautilus), and Dr.Jekyll/Mr.Hyde. The story has all these classic characters with a little bit from each of their own stories...like the fact that Africa does not let Alan Quartermaine die, or how Mina Harker came to be a vampire, or the Picture of Dorian Gray, and Mr.Hyde's story...and the movie could be said similar to Van Helsing. There is also a mention of Van Helsing as the co-worker of Jonathan Harker, Mina Harker's father. This is a truly amazing movie and you have to watch it carefully as each dialog is important.

The story is nothing spectacularly original about it especially when compared with Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel of the same name and yet it hits a nostalgic bone in me. I'm reminded of the days of epic stories that didn't have to make the most sense or be works of art, I get to sit back and watch trash at its finest. With mostly decent performances save for a few of the younger cast members and for the time great special effects, the film is well directed and edited, a cliche and mostly forgettable villain ultimately hampers what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable film series. I wonder if the lack of faithfulness to the novel affected the audience reception and if the film had been made with different characters and a different title it would have been more widely enjoyed but that's something we'll never know.

Second: why was Hawley Griffin replaced by Rodney Skinner (the invisible man)? Third: Why is Mina a vampire? She got bitten, yeah, but she was never changed.

I can't understand the people who were critical of this film for the use of non-21st Century equipment, or said it contained too much CGI (can there be too much CGI?) I thought the sets, costumes, script, development of each of the characters and the acting were superb (I especially enjoy the performances of Sean Connery, Peta Wilson and Stuart Townsend). The introduction of Captain Nemo's striking car in the middle of 1800's London, for example, was piquant. I don't very often get the chance, in my busy life, to sit down, put my feet up and watch a DVD - but when I do it is invariably LXG that goes on, even if it just for 10 minutes. I never tire of it. It couldn't have been a easy or comfortable movie for cast and crew to make - especially bearing in mind the worst floods in Eastern Europe in 300 years that shut down production for 3 weeks and ruined most of the sets. And what about the scene near the beginning in Dorian Gray's library, which was filmed in a disused sugar beet factory near Prague, and had a huge pile of rotting sugar beets approximately 20 feet behind Dorian's head when he's sitting down - apparently they had to have a person busy with the air fresheners to make the filming bearable!

I came in with the expectation of seeing something along the lines with ""Watchmen"", but one thing I never could have seen coming, was that this was the worst superhero movie I would ever see. The film starts out like any other ""We must assemble a team of the best"" but soon becomes a cliché mess, as Connery becomes the ""I'm retired"" guy. The rest of the cast is mediocre at best, with most having little to none back story. The bad guy in this movie is just horrible, while having NO back story, is also just a vague parody of bad guys from other movies. The movie also has a plot twist that revolves around The Phantom, but it was so bad, that I began to think that this movie was directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Now, the only reason this movie does not get a 1 out of 10, is the sometimes awesome fight-scenes, and special and visual effects. The special effects are very inconsistent. They can at times be way ahead of their time and other times look like something out of a poorly made 1980'ies B-movie. The script I think is the worst part of the movie. It seems like every line of dialog has to start with a one-liner in this movie and that gets very annoying after a while. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone but action-lovers, as some of the fight-scenes was very well done.

I'm starting to think it that he should stick to sculpture and leave movie directing alone. And Alan Moore, what happened? You wrote ""From Hell"", you can do so much better. I did watch this one again however. On the occasional chance movies on TV can be better then on the big screen. It was.

Unfortunately for me, the special effects were overdone, and the writing too thin.It is one of those movie constructs that probably seemed like a great idea at the outset, but the challenges required to incorporate so many legends into a couple of hours terribly stretched the writers ability to significantly develop any character dimension. (This is almost a crime when working with great actors like Sean Connery.) With the writing so flat, there was a gnawing contrast with the overwhelming special effects, leaving it virtually impossible for a viewer to ever suspend disbelief long enough to buy into the experience.

From the technical point of view, the film is pathetic: a submarine is doing many miles per hour in the open sea and the hair of the actors is as neat as being in church. Fake Venice and fake submarines and fake castles in the middle of a fake frozen Mongolia are no way to be explained. The film does start being mildly interesting but everything falls apart very soon. The best bit: Sean Connery as Quatermain shooting the iron-chested assassin from 900 yards with an old rifle. It remained me of the classical Connery in his roles as Bond, James Bond. Advice: don't buy/rent the film, get the book from any of the characters, you'll have so much better time and entertaining.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
646,anniegoose10,League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,9,3 July 2006,"I really like this movie. Ironically, when I was at Target today, the movie was on sale for real cheap, so I bought it.Much to my surprise, it is on TV tonight. So far, I have seen the last 3/4 of the movie, all the way to the ending, and then it re-started with commentary.Sean Connery is one of my ultimate favourite actors. So, when I saw the movie on sale today, HOW COULD I resist? I couldn't.Since I ended up here before I could see all the actors who are also in this 'extraordinary' movie, I cannot comment, except to say that I like them as well.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
647,yeung169,Surprisingly entertaining,6,26 October 2006,"Having been critically panned by both film critics and fans of the original comic book version, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (which is hardly a league of ""Gentlemen"" considering the presence of a female character) was absolute rubbish. However, despite the flagrant misuse of characters established in classic Literature (Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and especially The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) there is an essentially a massively fun film to be found, made all the more enjoyable if you disengage your brain and just don't question the ridiculous goings on of the alternate Victorian universe the film is set in.So in conclusion, if a night of brainless action adventure fun is what you'r after, then the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is sufficiently enjoyable material.",The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen
