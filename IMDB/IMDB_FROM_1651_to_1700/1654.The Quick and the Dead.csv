0,bkoganbing,A Fast Draw Superbowl,8,27 January 2008,"Although The Quick and the Dead is primarily remembered among film fans starring Sharon Stone as a revenge seeking frontier woman, for me the film stands out because of Gene Hackman. As John Herod, outlaw kingpin and ruler of the outlaw town of Redemption, Hackman is one of the most evil people ever created in any film genre.Sharon Stone has excellent reasons for wanting this man dead, although the truth is the key to the whole film and I won't say. Suffice to say, she's learned the gunman's trade and more than holds her own with any of the male competitors.In westerns about outlaw towns the usual is for the outlaws to respect each other as they are all men on the dodge. That's not what you get in The Quick and the Dead. Hackman for his sadistic amusement decides to conduct a fast draw contest, a kind of fast draw Superbowl. He's even kidnapped a former member of his band, Russell Crowe, who has renounced violence and become a preacher. And his unacknowledged offspring Leonardo DiCaprio is in the contest as well.There is of course a big similarity to the Kirk Douglas/Johnny Cash western, A Gunfight. But in that it was just the two of them staging a contest for both pride and money. That's expanded on quite a bit in The Quick and the Dead.I thought Gene Hackman was brilliant in the Clint Eastwood classic, The Unforgiven. Brilliant and evil also. But Hackman's character of a town marshal in The Unforgiven is a boy scout next to the outlaw kingpin of The Quick and the Dead.",The Quick and the Dead
1,Leofwine_draca,Scattershot western spoof with lots of energy and a great supporting cast,7,22 October 2016,"Sam Raimi does it again with this affectionate and entertaining take on the western genre. It's a light-hearted and simple film, comfortable to whizz along with a witty script delivered by an ensemble cast, and while you won't see anything new here, the wild west staples are delivered with relish and gusto. Made soon after ARMY OF DARKNESS, this is very much in the EVIL DEAD style, with all manner of camera tricks and transformations to mark it out as something standing separate from the rest.I always appreciate a good cast and here's a film that doesn't disappoint. As the heroine, Sharon Stone manages to be fairly engaging, which is unusual considering the rest of her filmography. Still, she's overshadowed by some excellent fellow cast members, including Russell Crowe in his first Hollywood film. What a choice! A youthful Leonardo DiCaprio manages to be fairly non-irritating playing ""The Kid"", and an excellent cast of stereotyped 'bad guy' actors fill out the nefarious roles.There's SAW villain Tobin Bell, trusty stalwart Keith David, good old Lance Henriksen as a sharp shooter and best of all Gene Hackman, lording it up as the arch nemesis who rules his town with an iron fist. Lots of familiar faces (like Gary Sinise and Pat Hingle) also pop up, making this enjoyable just for the cast. But the fun twists and turns in the plot, the various shoot-outs (never boring, despite being so plentiful), and the little touches like the hole in the shadow make this a genuinely enjoyable movie. Good work, Sam!",The Quick and the Dead
2,SnoopyStyle,Sharon Stone attempts to be Clint Eastwood,6,15 September 2013,Ellen (Sharon Stone) is a mysterious gunslinger who signs up for a gun draw competition. Herod (Gene Hackman) is the evil leader of the town who devise the competition to draw out all his would-be assassins. Cort (Russell Crowe) is a prisoner forced to fight again. Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the young buck looking to make a name for himself.Director Sam Raimi has made a pretty simple western movie. There is a bit of a backstory of Herod's history with Ellen. The only interesting thing is that the lead gunfighter is a woman. Sharon Stone really does her best to be Clint Eastwood for what it's worth. The style just isn't rough or gritty. It moves along just enough to be watchable.,The Quick and the Dead
3,classicsoncall,"""Maybe one day your luck will run out.""",8,9 April 2012,"The Western is my favorite movie genre and I've seen hundreds of them. After a while it's difficult to find anything unique about them because it's usually the good guys versus the bad guys and when you get to the end justice is generally served. ""The Quick and The Dead"" combines elements of your typical Western themes, the evil town boss who rules with an iron will, gunslingers out to prove who's the fastest draw, and the no-name stranger who hits town seeking revenge for a past wrong. There's even a former outlaw who's turned to the Bible in an effort to seek redemption, adding some resonance to the name of the town where the story takes place.What I think is cool about this picture is the stylized approach director Sam Raimi brings to the project - not quite parody, but definitely not a straight on revenge Western. Many of the characters are brought to life with their own over the top characterizations, my favorite being the card sharp liar Ace Hanlon (Lance Henricksen). You know he's good as a quick draw artist, you just don't know how fast he really is until villain Herod (Gene Hackman) chews him up and spits him out. Other outrageous characters include Scars (Mark Boone Junior) and Dog Kelly (Tobin Bell) who add some zest to the picture.The twist to the story if there is one is that the main protagonist is a woman, Sharon Stone as the unnamed Lady (until she's named by preacher Cort in their showdown). The Lady's history is told in flashback throughout the picture to prepare the viewer for the eventual finale. So when you see Cort (Russell Crowe) gun down The Lady, it's an instinctive 'Oh no' moment that seems to undercut the basis for the story. Yet it's just another clever ruse thrown in by Raimi to divert our attention and set us up for the final showdown.What Western movie purists will object to are some of the cartoonish elements used to overemphasize a point, such as Ace Hanlon's back flip over his horse to shoot the ace card, or the bullet hole through Herod's head when Ellen gets her revenge. I have to admit I was put off by some of those antics upon my first viewing, but now take them in stride as the kind of excess that bring an element of fun to the movie. That, and the great assemblage of players who appear here, many of whom were yet to hit the big time. Instinctively, I get the impression that this was a blast to make for all the principals involved.",The Quick and the Dead
4,jboothmillard,The Quick and the Dead,6,15 September 2005,"For a western film from director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man), this is quite good. Sharon Stone plays Ellen ""The Lady"", a female cowboy visiting the town called Redemption for a particular reason. Later on, you find out she accidentally killed her father, and she can think of only one person to blame for making her do it, the horrible John Herod (Gene Hackman). Herod is a cowboy who is best known as never losing any showdowns when one is set, and this is the main theme of the film besides her revenge, a shooting competition. Also in the competition are prisoner Cort (Russell Crowe), who originally said he won't fight, and Herrod's son, Fee ""The Kid"" (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has some of the fastest hands in the west. Also starring Saw's Tobin Bell as Dog Kelly, Roberts Blossom as Doc Wallace, Kevin Conway as Eugene Dred, Volcano's Keith David as Sgt. Clay Cantrell, Lance Henriksen as Ace Hanlon, Batman's Pat Hingle as Horace and Gary Sinise as The Marshal. The cast is good, the action is cool, and the western genre seems to still create watchable films like this. Good!",The Quick and the Dead
5,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'The Quick And The Dead',8,11 November 2006,"Like the western ""Wild Bill"" that also came out around this time, this is a pretty wild, almost cartoon-like western. It has many pluses and minuses.GOOD - Great sound, interesting camera angles and very stylishly shot. The visuals and audio make it interesting alone. Add a simple but interesting story filled with wild cartoon-like characters and you have a fun, fast-moving film. Western purists will hate the movie because it's filled with over-the-top characters. The most interesting, I thought, was Gene Hackman as the villain and Russell Crowe as the good-guy ""preacher"" named ""Cort."" Sharon Stone's character, ""Ellen,"" is very reminiscent of the one she played in ""The Specialist,"" a movie which came out the previous year in which - as in this movie - revenge is her main motive.BAD - This is only bad if you are religiously-inclined. The ""preacher"" in here is questionable as such. No real preacher uses the Lord's name in vain which Crowe did twice here. His theology also is not Biblically, more like clueless Hollywood stereotypes. Also, there was a bit too much of the feminist slant in here. Then again, since Stone co-produced the film, it's not surprising. Actually, her character - especially when she begins to soften a bit - is interesting, too. OVERALL - Despite the usual bias, the movie is fun to watch and entertaining.",The Quick and the Dead
6,rmax304823,Nice Cast. Period.,3,20 February 2016,"When it comes to ritualized shootouts in the Old West, you can go too far -- and they have gone it.Sharon Stone can give a convincing performance when she has the chance, as in ""Casino."" But who -- even among the professionals here -- can give anything resembling a performance in this clumsy Kabuki Theater?The director seems to have aimed for an even more highly stylized spaghetti Western than the originals, but the target has been riddled with holes and the intent has finally lodged somewhere in the center mass of a first-person video game for ten-year-olds.A shame to do this to such a competent cast but they're all DOA. Yes. It's a one-way ticket to Boot Hill.The movie isn't worth as much attention as it's gotten.",The Quick and the Dead
7,ma-cortes,Thrilling Western in Spaghetti style in which a mysterious stranger female arrives in a township where takes place a quick-draw competition,6,7 April 2015,"Peculiar Western with spectacular gun battle between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman . The title ""The Quick and the Dead"" comes from the King James translation of the Bible, I Peter 4:5, which admonishes the believer from behaving like pagans, ""who shall give account to Christ that is ready to judge the quick and the dead"" . This violent Western is set on a township called Redemption , the star is a mysterious female revenger , ¨a woman without name¨ (Sharon Stone as Clint Eastwood-alike interloper) who has a secret agenda of her own . It deals about a gunfighter arriving a little town , it has the usual shops and buildings, as General merchandise, Livery stable, boarding house , Hardware , Barber shop, Saloon , Hotel and Church . The western town owned by a ruthless gunslinger (Gene Hackman) hosting an elimination tournament to find the fastest gun in the West , as Lady avenger comes to the aid of embattled citizens as well as searching vendetta . The excitement starts at the duel when the hands point straight up .This offbeat Western contains thrills , parody , black comedy , hilarious set-pieces , and breathtaking duels . This special Western picture concerns upon a deadly gun-battle pits two individualist characters and it results to be an enjoyable as well as hyperbolic homage to the style and vengeance fantasy of Sergio Leone Spaghettis ; as it takes parts from ¨Dollars trilogy¨ : ¨For a fistful of dollars¨, ¨For a fistful of dollars more¨ and ¨The good , the bad and the ugly¨, along with ¨Once upon a time in the West¨. But it has nothing to do with the Spaghetti maestro , the great Sergio Leone . There is also an impressive roaring climax with an amazing final showdown . All of the actors on the set in the gunfight scenes were instructed in the art of the quick draw by a stunt coordinator . The violent gun-play is heightened by a slick , often amazing use of F.X. , plenty of blood and gore . However , the film is pretty well but it doesn't work at all and packs endless close-ups, sluggish scenes , flaws , gaps and many scenes reveal nothing . So many good actors , such excellent actors as Kevin Conway , Keith David , Lance Henriksen , Pat Hingle ,Gary Sinise , Mark Boone Junior , Robert Blossom's last role in a theatrical feature and final film by Woody Strode who appears briefly as a coffin maker in the opening scene . And Russell Crowe's first American feature, he has a hot sex scene with Sharon , but director Sam Raimi decided that it wasn't a necessary part of the story , the scene was not included in the American release of the film, but international versions do include it. The lion's share of the acting meat deservedly goes to Gene Hackman as an unrepentantly nasty . And a very young Leonard DiCaprio is surprisingly effective as a rookie gunslinger .Exciting and fitted to action musical score by Alan Silvestri . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Dante Spinotti .The motion picture was well produced by Sharon Stone . Sharon was given a lengthy list of directors that had been approved to direct this film, so that she could choose the directors she thought would work , Sharon sent back a list with a single name , Sam Raimi ; she said it was because she liked Evil Dead and Army of Darkness , among Raimi's other works.",The Quick and the Dead
8,moonspinner55,"Intentionally over-the-top, but flimsy instead of full-bodied...",5,16 September 2007,"Flashy but flimsy western tries for fantasy-mythic feel but never quite achieves its ambitions. Sharon Stone plays mysterious lady gunslinger who signs up for dueling contest in a tumbleweed town once she discovers her mortal nemesis is involved, the mangy varmint who was instrumental in killing her sheriff father. Spirited, but shallow, artistically-wayward western with tongue-in-cheek. It has some silly flash and sass, but it isn't involving, nor do any of the players (a jaw-dropper of a cast which includes Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gary Sinise) come off looking especially good. Director Sam Raimi sets up some visually amazing shots--but without honest, gritty characters, it's not much more than a live-action cartoon. Stone is flippant and sexy, but she's just relying on her proved shtick and it quickly wears thin. ** from ****",The Quick and the Dead
9,Quinoa1984,"few ways a Sam Raimi western could go wrong, and it only does in one big way",7,22 December 2009,"The Quick and the Dead is director Sam Raimi having a good time in his first non-horror/action movie up to that time in his relatively young career (he was 34 or 35 when he directed this film). He looks at the Western and thinks, 'OK, let's throw in some Sergio Leone Spaghetti fun in here, from the opening ala Fistful of Dollars, and the main crux of the vengeance plot can have something to do with Once Upon a Time in the West- flashback included, of course.' While he thinks this, he's also still making the film his own in a lot of ways, notably in the gunfights. It's mostly a serious film though, not a dark comedy like Evil Dead or silly like Army of Darkness, even if there is a sense of subtle self-parody among some of the actors cast.Oh, a note about the cast: this is one of the strangest but, on the whole, most effective ensembles of the 1990's. You've got everyone here you'd want to see in a ""guy"" movie from the time, with a few surprises: Keith David, Lance Henrikson, Woody Strode (also from 'Once Upon a Time'), Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, back when he was, to the girls, 'Leo', here aka ""The Kid""), Tobin Bell (yes, again, Jigsaw from Saw). But to top it off are two stars at the top of the bill (shared with Crowe and DiCaprio) that is a truly mixed bag. Both of the stars contribute, and take away, from the merits of the story, about a gunslinger competition that is more akin, to anything, of a Gladiatorial competition as it's to the death and run by a ruthless quasi-emperor (you can even see Crowe in a pre-Maximus role here as the Preacher).It's stars Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone that makes this compelling and curiously uninteresting at the same time. Hackman is one thing: he's taking on a role that is far more actually evil (if not quite as scary in his humane way in Unforgiven), as the head of the town who strikes fear into everyone so much that you can feel the chill in the room in blazing hot weather. Hackman's delivery of the dialog is better than any other conceivable actor in the role, and he also is there in one of the movie's best scenes- maybe the one truly genius one all-around- where we see the first time that someone is shot rather gruesomely, and there's a slight pause from the onlookers, and then the most forced-polite applause ever seen. Watching Hackman alone is perhaps reason enough, even if you're not a Sam Raimi fan, to see Quick and the Dead.Sharon Stone, on the other hand, is another story. For all of her glaring looks and her quiet would-be Clint Eastwood vocals, I just never bought her as a gunslinger-bad-ass like she is here. It's not that the part is poorly written (some of the lines of dialog could have been reworked, but such as a Western happens sometimes), but that she can't really carry the role well enough - not compared to everyone else around her, who fill in their roles (even DiCaprio) like it's nothing at all. It's forced work that soon becomes kind of boring, with the only slight saving grace being the final showdown gun battle between the hero and villain. The film might not have been truly great without her anyway, but she's really the one thing, for me, keeping it from being a true must-see rather than just a very fine curiosity.By a 'very fine curiosity' I mean that if you're hanging out on a Sunday night with your Dad (and you know the one, who loves Westerns so much he'll even forgive the crappy ones by John Wayne), possibly with a few brews, and Quick & Dead comes on TV, you should watch it. It's that kind of movie, and a interesting, if flawed, genre departure for Raimi.",The Quick and the Dead

He claims that Hackman is his father. Russell Crowe plays a former outlaw, who got religion and is now forced by Hackman and his group to participate in the shooting.To me, the picture is a typical shoot them up western. The bodies begin to pile up as we finally learn that Stone is there for vengeance.Stone is adept at the part, but I can imagine Jane Russell in her youth doing this role.",The Quick and the Dead
11,sunwarrior13,Simply One Dimensional,8,8 January 2012,"Director Sam Raimi brings his trademark comic book-influenced visual panache to this post-modern Western movie entitled The Quick And The Dead. Sharon Stone stars as Ellen, a mysterious female gunslinger who arrives in the frontier hamlet of Redemption for a contest pitting quick-draw artists against each other together with Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio.The story focuses on ""The Lady"",played by Stone, a gunfighter who rides into the 1878 Wild West town of Redemption, controlled by the ruthless John Herod.The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death.Writer Simon Moore wrote the screenplay.It is dedicated to veteran Western actor Woody Strode, who appears in a cameo as Redemption's coffin maker, his final performance.The event is the brainchild of Redemption's evil,corrupt mayor,Herod, a criminal who has taken over the town and charges a 50% tax on local businesses. The pot for Herod's deadly game has swollen, attracting numerous colorful gunfighters from around the territory. As each battle thins the ranks of players, the pasts of several participants are revealed. Ellen is seeking revenge on Herod for a heinous past injustice. The fast-talking braggart known as ""The Kid"" may in fact be Herod's son. The pacifist Reverend Cort, who refuses to participate in the bloodshed, is the fastest draw in the West and a former colleague of Herod's. After several spectacular slaying, Ellen and Herod stage a final showdown, but not before he has made her an unexpected proposal.The film was simply too one-dimensional.Although it is rarely dull, it is not noticeably compelling either.The derivative offshoot of a derivative genre, it inevitably runs out of energy well before any of its hotshots runs out of bullets as a Western movie.Despite of the talented cast it had,they simply looked bored as there was never a line of Gene Hackman dialogue that didn't sound as if he believed it.Also,the plot was preposterous that one may probably feel disinterested in it except to the actors/actresses involved in it.",The Quick and the Dead
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Nice try from Raimi, but ultimately it creeps just above average.",6,14 July 2010,"The Western is a tough genre to tackle in the modern age, more so when it's post Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven's masterclasses 101. But tackling both these challenges is nothing to the one which director Sam Raimi asks of the audience in his stab at the genre.A female gunslinger is here played by a Hollywood beauty, Sharon Stone, but she isn't right for the lead role. She obviously looks gorgeous and she broods and pouts better than most of her modern day peers, but she lacks a menacing streak, a bit of believable nastiness that just might have lifted the film to better heights. We understand and expect the vulnerability she shows, but to succeed here in the testosterone fuelled town of Redemption, she's going to have to convince as a tough gal. And Stone just isn't up to the task.The film does have good points to enjoy though, very much so. The story, although gimmicky, works well as an entertaining popcorn munching tale, while the cast list reads like a whose who of solid and quality thespers, (Gene Hackman wandering in from Unforgiven to play Little Bill's ghost, Russell Crowe, Leonardo DeCaprio, Keith David, Pat Hingle & Lance Henriksen). Also into the plus column is the always impressive cinematography from Dante Spinotti, and there is no denying Sam Raimi's keen eye for detail, with his zooming shots a real treat during the shoot out sequences - his Spaghetti Western leanings further enhanced by Alan Silvestri's pasta influenced score.Yet in spite of this bravado attempt, and acknowledging that the makers have tried something different, The Quick & The Dead isn't quite quick enough on the draw to outlive the leading lady misstep. 6/10",The Quick and the Dead
13,CinemaSerf,I kept expecting James Garner to pop up somewhere...,6,11 August 2020,"Now I saw this in the cinema in 1995 and had somehow managed to completely forget all about it - until I saw it again just last week and realised why. It's not that it is awful, it's just that it is so very derivative and very, very dependant on Gene Hackman (""Herod"") who walks a fine line between menace and ham in a none too convincing fashion. He is running a to-the-death gun slinging competition - almost like one of the chivalric jousts of old - with the winner having to face him in the final shoot-out for an huge poke. Sharon Stone (""Ellen"") arrives in his dingy town just at the start of the process determined to avenge her father's killer; Russell Crowe is ""Cort"", a preacher who also has a pretty violent past and ""the Kid"" (Leonardo di Caprio) who has the clear belief that his youth and skill make him all but immortal are all coaxed, cajoled and threatened into participating in this game of death. Sam Raimi has all the ingredients of a great little western adventure, but the cast don't work well together at all. Stone is well past her potent best and the usual guy-with-a-grudge theme is now so hackneyed as to render this little better than a series of gunfights with characters about whom I could not care less. The cinematography and some of the photographic styles are interesting, though - the film has a classy look to it and Alan Silvestri creates some tension with his slightly untypical (for a western) score; but the whole is nowhere near the sum of the parts leaving us with something that now, more than ever, just looks like it's been made for telly.",The Quick and the Dead

It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre.Who would have known, Sharon Stone is a believable cowgirl. I think it's fair for me to say that she's the best I have seen in a western. The movie also features both Russell Crow and Leonardo DiCaprio before their days of fame and big Dollars. It's always fun and great to have Gene Hackman in a villain role and he makes this movie an even more pleasant watch. The movie features lot's of other fun and stereotype western characters.The settings and costumes are great and real western like and help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. The great western score is by Alan Silvestri and fits the movie well, even though the score goes a bit too much ""Back to the Future"" like at times.The movie is filled with some unusual but great Sam Raimi like cinematography and tricks.Just enjoy and don't pay attention to the story.

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Raimi, you have got to be kidding...",6,13 December 2004,"It's not uncommon to see a western flick that's boring... it might even be more common among the newer ones(I wouldn't know, haven't seen most of them... thankfully). But when you see a western flick with Sam Raimi's name on the director credit... I mean, this man brought us A Simple Plan and Darkman! Sure, he did Spiderman as well, but I can look past that, since most of the other films he's done are great(from what I hear, at least... have only seen the three aforementioned and, of course, this one). But this film is really a dud. I tried to watch the first ten-fifteen minutes with an open mind, I really did. The film just didn't grab my attention at all, despite the fact that I was serving it on a silver platter. The plot is boring and horribly poorly paced. I almost fell asleep during the finale... only to be awakened by a couple of explosions... apparently thrown in there for fun(much like they were in Spiderman). Maybe Raimi regressed into childhood, and just settled for blowing stuff up for the entertainment of those who are easily entertained; I don't know. The acting isn't particularly good. The characters are all poorly written western flick clichés. The action is derivative of spaghetti westerns, but, unlike aforementioned genre, not even the least entertaining. The humor is lame. The film is clichéd, and seems to have trouble determining if it wants to salute westerns or make fun of them. Only one positive comment comes to mind; some of it is actually nicely filmed. The cinematography doesn't suck exactly as much as the rest of the film does. It's somewhat close, though, as those interesting pans and angles are few and far between. I really didn't enjoy this film, and I'm not going to claim that I wasted time paying attention to the whole thing. I watched with(at most) half an eye open ten-fifteen minutes scattered somewhat indiscriminately over the whole film. I recommend it only to western flick junkies and huge fans of Raimi. 6/10",The Quick and the Dead
16,view_and_review,"Better Run, Better Run, Outrun My Gun",7,23 August 2020,"""The Quick and the Dead"" would've been a better movie if two things were different.1.) Gene Hackman hadn't played a virtually identical role in ""Unforgiven"" (a much better movie might I add).2.) Sharon Stone's lines were better. I never thought very highly of Sharon Stone and this movie did nothing to help that opinion.""The Quick and the Dead"" is about a depraved town run by an even more depraved despot named John Herod (Gene Hackman). All types of unsavory characters were in town for a quickdraw contest being overseen by Herod. Like the Hair Club for Men president, Herod was not only the official of the contest he was also a contestant.Those of note entering into the contest were Ellen (Sharon Stone), Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), Sgt. Clay Cantrell (Keith David), Ace (Lance Henrikson), and Cort (Russell Crowe). Ellen and Kid had very personal reasons for entering the contest, Clay had pecuniary reasons, Ace seemed to have no reason, and Cort was being forced into the contest.There were some good aspects to TQATD: the gunplay and the wide array of characters. Though the movie was hampered by the camerawork (rapid zoom-ins and zoom-outs), Ellen's anachronistic outfit (I doubt they had hip hugging jeans in the 19th century), and Ellen's horrible lines. Not only were the lines weak, the delivery of the lines was equally anemic. Sharon Stone may as well had been a robot. She wore this dour look the whole movie and spoke as though she didn't know what emotion she was supposed to project.I love westerns, old and new, and even though I'd watch this again if it was on--and nothing else was on--I don't rank it that highly among westerns.",The Quick and the Dead

The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod.Herod is also the owner, leader, and ""ruler"" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again.Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ...This little cult classic was unfairly overlooked when released, probably because Stones name was over the title. If you remember, this was a time when she released stinker after stinker, so it's understandable people stayed away. I was interested to see how Raimi would handle the then flagging western genre, and he injects new life into it, thanks to some amazing lighting and camera-work.The story and narrative is simple, but the characters that we have are delicious, and all have their own traits. Stone is okay, as is Crowe and Dicaprio. But Hackman owns this film in a big way. It's as if he's taken his little Bill character and added a pantomime twist to him.He's ridiculously over the top and commands every scene he's in.It's a fantastical flight of a movie, with some fine scenarios and a great final fifteen minutes.

18,Wuchakk,Mythic Western about a radical quick-draw contest in an Arizona town with an all-star cast (sort of),7,5 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Quick and the Dead"" stars Sharon Stone as a grim, nonchalant woman who, curiously, enters a dueling contest in a remote SW desert town ""ruled"" by outlaw Herod (Gene Hackman). A pacifist preacher is forced by Herod to participate in the contest, but he ain't not conventional minister (Russell Crowe). Other notable cast members include: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Henriksen, Tobin Bell, Keith David, Gary Sinise and Pat Hingle.The stunning Sharon Stone was co-producer and was responsible for getting the youthful & skinny DiCaprio in the cast, she even paid his salary (?!). Stone also apprehended New Zealander Crowe with this being his first American feature. When dressed in her tight leather pants Sharon was unable to sit down (lol). Interestingly, she fired her hottie stand-in because she was getting more attention from the crew on set (!). She later confessed that Crowe was her favorite on screen kisser, but kissing DiCaprio was like kissing her arm (lol).The tone is mythic in the manner of those notable spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but with superior production values and obviously seminal to Tarantino Westerns (""Django Unchained"" and ""The Hateful Eight""). While the vibe isn't exactly realistic, the cast members take the material seriously and ham it up with gusto. You can tell they all had a great time. The movie's town bound and comic booky with larger-than-life characters, but it's not campy or comedic, although it's somewhat silly.""The Quick and the Dead,"" the film's title, is presumably taken from 1 Peter 4:5 of the KJV translation of the Bible, which details how Christ ""is ready to judge the quick and the dead."" The phrase also appears in the Apostle's Creed with the same meaning. In both cases 'quick' is an Old English term for ""living.""

20,Mr-Fusion,"Reputation aside, it grows on you",7,8 March 2019,"Not a bad movie at all, but it does take a bit to really settle into. For a while, Sharon Stone is really trying to sell the macho gunslinger with baggage, but she's doing it with her Hollywood looks and pearly whites; she's missing grit. And that does improve later on, but like I said, patience is needed.That said, Sam Raimi is clearly having fun in a sandbox full of Western cliches. The draws, the face zooms, the shots. It looks fantastic. If that's not enough, then it's worth a look for Gene Hackman's performance. No trace of Unforgiven here; dude's a genuine scumbag.",The Quick and the Dead

This story revolved around a small town which had been taken over by John Herod, (Gene Hackman) ""Superman"" who was an evil outlaw and was ruthless and cruel and controlled all the people in the town. Sharon Stone, (Ellen/The Lady), ""Bobby"" played the role of a gal who could handle herself very well with men and was fast with the pistols, a Pistol Pack'n Mama who had her targets on John Herod for something he did to her while she was a child. Russell Crowe, (Cort) ""A Good Year"", becomes friends with Ellen and they decided to team up against John Herod. Leonardo DiCaprio, (Fee Herod/The Kid) plays the role of John Herod's only son who is always trying to please his dad as a gunfighter, but is always being put down by his dad. There is plenty of action and the ending will take you by complete surprise. Don't miss this gem of a film back in 1995 when everyone looked young and great. Enjoy!",The Quick and the Dead

The movie is directed by Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man""), but it fails to come across as anything more than a modern-day cowboy story, complete with fast camera cuts and stylistic shootout tricks. Not really anything special, despite the fact that it could have been amazing. This was Russell Crowe's first mainstream motion picture, and Stone wanted Leonardo DiCaprio in the film so much that she decided to put some of her own paycheck towards his to get him aboard for the project.

24,KineticSeoul,It's like a comic book western,7,8 June 2012,"Now I enjoy western movies and although this doesn't have that traditional western vibe going for it, it's still pretty darn entertaining. This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one.7.8/10",The Quick and the Dead

Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe - the latter two admittedly in the early stages of their careers. It makes you wonder how such a solid cast can manage to put out such a miserable movie. It makes you wonder some more. How was it that the pretty solid cast - well, at least Hackman, since DiCaprio and Crowe were young and Stone was the producer so was kind of obliged - was convinced to be a part of such a miserable movie. Yes, it makes you wonder. How such a solid cast - and even the then younguns have proved that they're talented since - could put on such dreadful performances. It makes you wonder.What I'm saying is that this movie was dreadful. The story was weak, the performances uninspired, much of the dialogue just downright silly, and the director for some reason had some sort of a fetish for close up shots of bad teeth.Yes, it makes you wonder.

26,g-bodyl,Back to the West!,9,8 August 2013,"The Quick and the Dead is a good, if not a bit derivative western. It seems like this was one of the few westerns to come out in the 1990's due to the lack of popularity. This is a good shoot-em-up that has fun gun battles, great acting, impressive visual shots of the landscape, and smooth direction from Sam Raimi.Raimi's film is about a lone female rider who rides into the town of Redemption looking for some revenge. She takes part of a contest held by the sadistic man named Herod in order to make Herod pay for ruining her life.This film features some great acting. I believe it's been proved that Gene Hackman can do anything. This role reminds me of his famous role he had in Unforgiven. Sharon Stone is decent and pretty-looking. Russell Crowe is great as usual as the preacher and young Leo proves he has acting chops in his pre-Titanic days.Overall, this is a fine western even though it offers nothing new. The action is pretty good and there were even a few jokes that produced mild chuckles from me. This is a worthy addition to any Western collection out there. I rate this film 9/10.",The Quick and the Dead
27,A_Different_Drummer,As much happening behind the lens as in front ....,9,6 November 2013,"Yes, I know the critics at the time panned it. But if that was the baseline for greatness, films like Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane would be lost to obscurity. Bottom line, this is a ""high concept"" film that is much more entertaining than you would guess. The timeline is fascinating. In the 1960s, after a half-century run, and massive exposure on the new medium called Television, the classic western started to disappear. But, as they say, nature abhors a vacuum; and at the same time the sun started to set on the traditional western, it started to rise on something called the ""italian westerns"" or re-imaginings of the genre from Europe. This is for example how Clint Eastwood went from forgotten TV actor (Rawhide) to #1 box office attraction. This new genre lasted barely 15 years or so and soon disappeared as well. Yet out of nowhere, 20 years later someone in Tinseltown gets the idea to re-imagine the ALREADY RE-IMAGINED western, this time starring a female. Sharon Stone was past the apex of her career by this point, making the project more of a challenge. The other talent was awesome. A pre-Oscar Russell Crowe, a pre-Titanic diCaprio, and all backstopped by Hackman, I mean, wow. The big question, did it actually work? Answer yes. It was uneven in parts and an argument could be made that Hackman overdid the ""bad guy"" role or, alternatively, the part was over-written. Stone was awesome, proving she had the chops to take on a bizarre role and make it hers. Actually gets better with each successive viewing.",The Quick and the Dead
28,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,16 April 2016,"The Quick and the DeadWomen have showdowns everyday but instead of pistols they shoot glares at each other.Unfortunately, the female in this western will have to use something a little less subtle.In Redemption for the quick draw competition, the Lady (Sharon Stone) attracts the attention of the corrupt organizer (Gene Hackman) and his participants: an imprisoned preacher (Russell Crowe), a kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) with something to prove and a hired gun (Keith David).As the ranks thin, she draws closer to her true goal: killing the man who forced her to shoot her father (Gary Sinise).A visually striking oater with rapid-fire pacing and colorful characters, director Sam Raimi brings his frenetic style to the usually static Wild West showdown with eye-popping results.

29,tabuno,"The Good, Bad, and Ugly",7,20 January 2019,"23 April 2009. This Western is a fascinating cinematic effort that both intrigues and repulses. It combines stereotypical close in and move out shots, varying color schemes and photography along with the usual assortment of characters. The director plays it both straight and fancy, resorting to photographic and directorial Western gimmicks from other Westerns while at the same time inserting a more edgy, substantive screen presence. The effort both excels and fails. There is some restraint of the graphic violence while at the same time depicting further in a few scenes. There is both stereotypes as well as lingering, qualitatively increased depth of characterization through performances and small added dialogue or expressions. There is finally the climatic scene that has drama and emotional gumption. The inclusion of a familiar cast of stars many early in their career also heightens the entertainment value. This movie is both good, bad, and notoriously ugly for its mean characters. 7/10.",The Quick and the Dead

Its soley a female lead movie (shhhh in 2021 females are being heavily oppressed in Hollywierd so much that they forcefully make movies and shove it down my throat).*sigh* Anyways...TQATD is an old western, violentish movie.

31,tomgillespie2002,More fun than expected,5,10 October 2018,"By 1995, the western genre had all but disappeared completely from our cinema screens. Black-and-white tales of cowboys and Indians in America's Old West was the stuff your granddad would watch on television during the day and claim they just don't make 'em like this anymore. They didn't stop completely however, with the likes of Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man making an earnest attempt to infuse the genre with a psychedelic, folksy edge, and George P. Cosmatos' Tombstone turning the events at the OK Corral into an explosive action thriller. Some, like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, while adding a more sombre tone, successfully stuck the traditions of the genre, while others, like Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, simply took an old-fashioned premise and ran with it. If you're looking for revisionism or an interesting take on an iconic time in America's history, then The Quick and the Dead ain't the film for that, but you may just find yourself having a bit more fun that you expected.The town of Redemption was once a thriving community, but it now rests in the hands of the ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod (Gene Hackman). Herod enjoys a nice house while taxing his citizens 50% on any money they make, and apparently relieves his boredom by hosting a quick-draw contest every year. Gunslingers from all across the country arrive to take part - but God knows why, given the obviously high risk of death - including the mysterious Ellen (Sharon Stone), who shares a history with both the town and Herod himself. Also in town is Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), a cocky teenager with a steady hand who also believes he is Herod's unacknowledged son, and a repentant outlaw-turned-preacher named Cort (Russell Crowe). Cort is dragged into the contest against his will by Herod's cronies, and the boss man is seemingly angered at his former associate's new anti-violence stance. There's backstory and melodrama, but it's all just an excuse for a series of stand-offs in a town where it always seems to be high noon.While subverting expectations by enlisting a woman to play the central gunslinger, Raimi may as well have cast a broom in a wig, as Stone struggles to convincingly brood and frown and maintain any kind of interest in her character. Faring considerably better are DiCaprio and Crowe, who were just a few years off Titanic and Gladiator and the global stardom that followed. Their charisma and star quality are as clear as day, especially when they share a scene with the one-note Stone. For a film that boasts a wonderful supporting cast (Roberts Blossom, Tobin Bell, Keith David, Lance Henriksen and Gary Sinise are just some of the familiar faces), they all cower in the shadow of Gene Hackman, who somehow manages to turn some truly atrocious dialogue into Shakespeare. Yet the real star is Raimi's crazy camera lens. Before he was bringing Peter Parker's swinging exploits vividly to life in Spider-Man, he was crash-zooming on the faces of readying gunslingers and capturing daylight through a bullet-hole in the belly. It's silly, outrageous and wonderful. The problem is everything that comes in between, from the dreary central hero to the unengaging backstories.",The Quick and the Dead
32,johnnyboyz,Not quite quick enough for a place beyond the last-eight...,6,12 September 2016,"It is quite remarkable that ""The Quick and the Dead"" hangs together as well as it does. The film, needlessly overly stylised and forced into balancing too many ideas; stories and characters all at once, does not disgrace itself but similarly does not have you walk away from it feeling as if you have seen anything of any terrific substance. We are left wondering as to how a character, who was pronounced dead the last time we saw them, was up and walking and shooting as straight as they always could a mere five minutes later; left unsatisfied at the actually rather fascinating narrative between an aging sociopath and his cocksure son who is looking to inherit the autocratic rule which dominates the destiny of the small Old West town he runs; left underwhelmed at how the potential for romance between said cocksure son and a certain female character is not taken any further than what it was.This is a difficult film to recommend, but an even difficult film to entirely dislike. Its struggles derive from its short run-time and its bloated number of characters: a number of actually really fascinating stories about people who might otherwise have existed some 130 years ago are being told at once, but director Sam Raimi is forced, seemingly, into squeezing each of them into a run-time that constitutes as ""commercial"".Sharon Stone, in the tradition of westerns looking to tear up the rule-book, plays an otherwise unnamed lead (referred to throughout as ""The Lady"") who rides into an isolated Old West town called Redemption for reasons unexplained. She takes no flak from anyone – when one of the town's many grizzled male sociopaths drools ""You're Purty"" to her, she whips back ""...you're not"", which was particularly brave given he had just shot a man in the back and carved a mark onto his arm with a blade.Stone does what she can with the role, but her job is made harder by the film's eagerness to fall into traps of transgression – specifically, a woman is allowed to effectively 'lead' the film but the male audience, for whom the film is made, must be reminded of her 'to-be-looked-at-ness'. Take the opening, which is typical of any western opening with regards to its guitar music and desert locality, whereby somebody is shot off their horse by a trigger happy gold hunter. When it's revealed to be Stone, we are surprised at the fact it's a woman, and the manner about which the music begins to encompass sounds of a whip cracking, on top of the fact Stone has comically shackled the gold hunter to his wagon, suddenly alludes to a certain sexiness or quirky kinkiness she's supposed to embody.Meanwhile, in the town, Russell Crowe's character Cort is having a bad time at the hands of he who runs the place – Gene Hackman's suitably evil John Herod. Herod, a sadist and a psychopath, has dragged Cort away from his existence as a Christian missionary and to a place where people have seemingly been blinded into spitting on religion because here, Herod is God. Cort has some history with the man – they both used to be as bad as Herod presently is until Crowe's character turned away from violence. During The Lady's time in this place, and without giving anything away, it is alluded to that Herod was responsible for the death of someone quite close to her, while complicating matters is Leonardo Di Caprio, who play's Herod's son. He takes a liking to The Lady.These dynamics revolve around, of all things, a gun-slinging tournament, whereby 16 entrants fast-draw every time the town clock strikes the top of the hour – needless to say, most of the fighters are present in the tournament to make up the numbers so that the four that count can come to blows. In the interim, we find out what makes each of these people tick and how they have reached where they are in their lives – the backstories are substantial and often gripping; many would make for fascinating films all unto themselves. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the competition very quickly mutates into a fight to the death, lest the film's title seem misplaced.There is enough to admire in ""The Quick and the Dead"", but equally enough to become frustrated by. I've no doubt of the film's origins – those Italian and Spanish westerns of the 1960's, the likes of which are embedded at the very epicentre of Raimi's piece. The trouble with this is that, during one particularly harrowing scene, we are instantly reminded of the similar fate of a character in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. There are other issues, such as the realism related to whether Hackman's character, having experienced what he did as a boy in relation to his father, would then grow up to bestow upon everyone else what it is that he does.As said, there is too much going on and too many characters and their tales to fit into a mainstream run-time. Three years later, Raimi would make ""A Simple Plan"", which really is a quality film about people; predicaments and the way folks interact with their situations and one another. Needless to say, that film was longer and much better. You could do much worse than ""The Quick and the Dead"", but then if you looked hard enough, you could probably do a lot better.",The Quick and the Dead

How this junk got out to the public I can't fathom. It offered nothing in the way of drama; it did offer, however, some of the silliest 'comedy' which was not intended to be comedy. At least I don't think it was meant to be so. I expected a realistic movie about gunfighters; and got a bunch of overgrown boys playing at being Billy Badass. And Sharon Stone! Gad, this woman needs a new profession. Miscast maybe, or perhaps no actress could do much with such a stupid, overdone role.

That is the core and most original part of this silly cartoon like western. Fortunately great actor's star in this movie, because without these great actor's, this movie would have been a B-film at best, only worth to be released on dvd. But lots of money was poured into this western and all this technical attention for detail, makes it still worthwhile a watch, but please dont expect a serious western, because it is (probably) meant as a sort of cartoon like parody on westerns. But it failed at that too...Every western cliche in the book is deliberately rehashed, emphasized to the point where it indeed becomes sort of cartoon lke funny. But it aint a real comedy either. This western is perhaps best suited for those who want mindless entertainment, with action packed cruel violence.

35,Vartiainen,Thrilling black comedy western,6,8 September 2015,"A passion project for the lead actress and producer Sharon Stone, The Quick and the Dead is something of an oddity. A film of the 90s, where everything was all about masculinity, explosions and cigar-chomping heroes, it nevertheless features a female gunslinger as its main character and is honestly speaking more of a parody of westerns than an actual real deal. Certainly having Sam Raimi as director helped the latter point come into being.Still, it is a very fun movie to watch. Imagine Army of Darkness, only in western setting. Every single character is massively over the top, as is all the violence, making it into a source of comedy. The plot is rather simplistic, featuring the main character riding into town revenge in mind just as a gun duel contest is about to begin, but it is just deep enough to carry from start to finish. And really, the main points of this film are the characters and the parodying of older westerns, so the plot is just complex enough.What really saddens me and keeps this movie from being any better, is that they didn't go far enough, in my opinion. For example, Stone's character is certainly given a proper buildup to be a strong character in her own right, but then she simply fades into the background near the end of the movie and it comes down to two males dueling. Likewise most of the characters are introduced very interestingly, but few of their initial story lines ever go anywhere. I won't say that this ruins the film, because it's still entertaining enough, but it could have been better if the film makers had only taken proper advantage of what they had.Still, the film is definitely worth a watch if you've liked Raimi's other films and/or if you like strong female action heroes. Not the best example of either of those, but definitely above average in its own right.",The Quick and the Dead

37,bsmith5552,Pistol Packin' Sharon?,4,18 September 2001,"The premise of ""The Quick and the Dead"" is a gunfighter's tournament where 16 gunfighters face off against each other in individual showdowns until only one is left. How could this happen you ask?Well it seems that Gene Hackman has taken over the town and can do pretty much as he pleases. He fancies himself as the fastest gun this side of somewhere and sets out to prove it. The Hackman character is very much like the one he played in ""Unforgiven"" (1992) but not very convincing as a ""fast as blazes"" gunfighter being well into his 60s when this film was made. Still, he was the best thing about this film.The most ludicrous piece of casting is Sharon Stone as a pistol packin' gunfighter out to avenge the murder of her father (Gary Sinese) by Hackman years earlier. So, you guessed it, she enters the contest. You don't have to be too sharp to figure out who will be in the final showdown. Even more unbelievable is that being in a town full of low lifes and looking the way that she does, no one so much as makes a pass at Ms. Stone. Maybe they saw ""If These Walls Could Talk II"".Also in the cast in early roles, are Russell Crowe as a preacher with a past and Leonardo Di Caprio as fuzzy cheeked gunfighter named ""Kid"" (how original) who harbors his own secret. Crowe's mind seems to be elsewhere throughout the film and DiCaprio is laughable as a gunfighter.Sharon Stone executive produced this film. What was she thinking?

40,barnabyrudge,"Highly stylized western with visual panache. Sadly, it descends into plagiarism at the end.",6,25 December 2006,"The Quick And The Dead is a highly stylized western made at a time when westerns were few and far between. The entire film exists in a kind of prefabricated non-reality, where the characters are over-the-top, the action totally implausible and the colours deliberately garish and over-emphasised. Only when you accept these stylistic touches can you truly enjoy the film. Those who claim that the film is an insult to ""real"" westerns seem to be missing the point - this film is intentionally spoofing the whole spaghetti western sub-genre, and consequently is MEANT to be stylized and far-fetched (even spaghetti classics like A Fistful Of Dollars and Once Upon A Time In The West were stylized and far-fetched, for goodness sake!!!)In the desert town of Redemption, various sharpshooters gather to compete in a quick draw championship. The winner will be showered with glory and great riches. But there doesn't seem to be much doubt about who the winner will be, since the reigning champion Herod (Gene Hackman) is one fast son-of-a-bitch when it comes to the quick draw. One of the competitors is a mysterious woman named Ellen (Sharon Stone), whose motives remain hidden even though she makes it clear that she has some sort of score to settle with Herod. Others include a preacher named Cort (Russell Crowe) who used to be an outlaw, and a fresh-faced young Kid (Leonardo Di Caprio) who is angry because he believes Herod may be his father. In a series of violent shootouts the contestants are whittled down until only two remain - Ellen and Herod. Only at the point of winning or losing will she reveal her reasons for entering the competition..The film is directed by Sam Raimi, the man who brought us the outrageous Evil Dead. Here, Raimi lets his fondness for quirky humour, disorientating camera angles and choreographed violence run free. His film is intentionally and enjoyably overblown, with some fantastic visual flourishes. Having said that, there are a few negative elements that mar his film. The climactic revelation in The Quick And The Dead virtually plagiarises the closing denouement from Once Upon A Time In The West - it's one thing to spoof a film, but to practically STEAL its ending is a different matter altogether, and totally unacceptable. Also, the actors in this one don't really convince in their roles. It's awfully hard to swallow the concept that Stone's a sharp-shooting wiz with a vendetta to settle. Di Caprio has a one-dimensional role and is in the film purely because of his looks. Hackman and Crowe manage to fare slightly better (mainly because there's a fraction more depth to their roles). However, The Quick And The Dead is intended as an exercise in style and visual panache, so in many ways the shallowness of the characters is both inevitable and deliberate. It's an amusing and entertaining film to watch, and if you come to it in the right frame of mind there's no reason why you won't enjoy it.",The Quick and the Dead
41,hu675,Entertaining tribute to the Leone's movies and Raimi's own stylish moves.,8,26 November 2007,"A mysterious gunfighter (Sharon Stone) comes to a western town with no law. It has full corruption and killers in this place. But this lady is there for a reason but she's unwillingly joins an elimination tournament to win the big prize money. But the town's people are afraid of one man it's John Herod (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Gene Hackman) is a ruthless, rich, fearless, cold-hearted and a killer as well. Many various townspeople and mysterious guests are there for various reasons to win the tournament but this lady is there to settle a revenge that Herod isn't ready for.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, Spider Man Trilogy, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining, if sightly underrated western movie that Raimi lovingly tribute of the Spaghetti Westerns and even his film-making style. Like some of Raimi's better works, this more of a exercise of style over substance. Although Raimi's technique gets to be a bit much at times. But Raimi has a strong cast here including Oscar-Winner:Russell Crowe, Leonardi DiCaprio, Tobin Bell, Robert Blossoms, Lance Herkinsen and more. This picture might plays better on TV and on Video than it did on theaters. The performances are good here, which some of the cast members seems to be having a great time and the production values are first-rate. Despite it's flaws, it's certainly worth a look. Die Hard fans of Raimi's work and Western fans will enjoy this more than others. The late Woody Strode appears in a cameo in the opening sequence, which it is his final movie. Cult actor:Bruce Campbell is credited, although his scenes got deleted in the last minute for the final cut. (*** ½/*****).",The Quick and the Dead
42,drystyx,all the makings of a cult classic,10,17 February 2007,"The first time you watch this movie, you realize it has all the makings of a cult classic, and was obviously meant to fit in that genre. The plot is a basic super powered bad guy (""Gene Hackman) owns the Western town and controls it. As he says ""I decide who lives and who dies!"". He organizes a shooting contest, mostly to show his expertise, but also to indulge in his sadistic fantasies, one of which is to make a former gang member, turned atoning priest, into a sadistic killer like himself. Sharon Stone plays the woman looking for revenge upon Hackman. What makes this so unique and such a cult classic sort of movie are basically two ingredients. One is the theatre of the absurd atmosphere, and the filming techniques. In one scene a character seems to be a super marksman until Hackman makes a revealing testimony, then the camera suddenly cuts and zooms to a gunfight between the two. In another scene, a bullet is seen going through a man's body, and the viewer sees a cardboard cutout of the man with a hole in his chest. There are other well timed bits of absurdity, because this is not meant to be a believable story, but an enjoyable one, as if a pack of liars are trying to outdo each other in telling the events. The second ingredient is the multitude of interesting characters. Many of them at least partly sympathetic. There's the dandy Wild Bill character who loves attention, the kid, the Swede whom the kid wants to have him remember and tell of his exploits to others, the emotionless bounty hunting shootist, and Pat Hingle as a frightened townsman. This makes for exciting movie making. Certainly not to be taken seriously. A lot of people will resent the way it pokes fun at the super powered super sadistic bad guy character. I recommend it.",The Quick and the Dead

If the film was ten minutes long, it'd be fun, but because it's feature length, it's boring. Hackman doesn't disappoint or surprise and Sharon Stone, coming off ""Basic Instinct"", looks sexy with a gun and behaves like furniture thanks to her criminally underwritten role. Raimi has fun shooting holes in people that, via special effects magic, we can then see through, and he uses every trick in the book to pretty up what is a terrible, been-there-done-that plot that he knew would totally die if presented conservatively. He finally got story and style working together in ""Spiderman"" and consolidated his more educated vision in ""Spiderman 2"", so ""The Quick and The Dead"" is the tombstone that marked the end of the second chapter of his ascension to A-list status.",The Quick and the Dead

Well, the plot is much like Enter The Dragon in a western setting and it is about half as good and while this is not a low budget film, it feels rushed, cheap and cartoonish with some really out of place, hammy acting from a lot of the cast, principally Lance Hendrickson, who is one of the finest screen villains of his time is wasted on this production. The lead, Sharon Stone does little to elevate the material and pretty much walks through the film with an uninspired performance, which is surprising as she gave really strong performances in movies where she had a supporting role, she really stood out. In movies like Total Recall, Casino and Basic Instinct, she was incredible. Russell Crowe however did pretty good in his Hollywood debut. Not among his best, but solid and more than holding his own with the character actors and stars of the film. The best thing about this is Gene Hackman's performance as villain here, he is so good in this, he blows away the rest of the cast's, mostly too campy performances. The story and backstory are played out and overall the film was poorly executed, which would put director Sam Raimi at fault. I am sure he probably had the best intentions in mind and I bet he loves the genre, but unfortunately he was not qualified to make one and the film is proof of that. Even so, The Quick And The Dead is decent entertainment, much to the same effect as a low budget direct to video action movie.",The Quick and the Dead

Pat Hingle, Gene Hackman, and Gary Sinise were all mainstays, while Russell Crowe and Leonardo Dicaprio proved to be respectable (I also will say, this is the only film I like with Dicaprio in it). Sometimes funny, sometimes silly, this proves to be a welcome relief in the world of high-tech explosions and gun play.(funny story: My dad, who is an electrician, got to meet Sharon Stone when they were doing their Tucson shooting. He had to upgrade an electrical service because the tanning bed Stone needed was causing the breakers to trip too often.

Explain some of the stuff happening and the little touches that are added to certain characters. I want to see these more fleshed out, I want pulp and insanity, I want it stretched into a series where each week we're given another wild gunslinger to show up and do battle with. There's such potential here for crazy fun and it just doesn't fully get there. It's still fun though, it's crazy and fun for a western. Stone, Crowe, Hackman and DiCaprio are all doing some fun stuff it just doesn't reach the heights I'd like.This is still a solid experience, a great TV movie to enjoy whenever you feel like a little bit of odd western fun.

48,ShootingShark,"Exciting, Dusty, Supercool-Looking Avenging Cowgirl Western With Outstanding Cast",7,9 September 2007,"A mysterious female gunslinger appears in the lawless western town of Redemption, run by a sharpshooting killer named John Herod. Entering the no-holds-barred quick-draw competition, she has a score to settle with Herod dating back to her childhood ...I'm not generally a fan of movies where the star is also the producer, but Stone does a pretty good job on both fronts here, selecting the right people to get the most out of this stylish, latter-day spaghetti western. Although Raimi was a gun for hire (ahem), he fills the film with his uniquely stylish visuals - wild point-of-view shots, crazy angles, wacky whiplash moves, visual puns (at one point Stone has dynamite between her legs) and an extraordinary moment during the duel between Hackman and DiCaprio of eight - count them, eight - dizzying triple-zoom reverse shots in a row. And rarely have I seen a movie so well cast - all the support players are wonderful (especially David as a pipe-smoking gentleman killer and Henriksen as a stylish joker) and the four leads are terrific. Stone is a little uneven - she's better when she's playing up her heroine's vulnerability - but is an iconic and almost unique female western lead (Johnny Guitar is the only rival). Crowe and DiCaprio, both of whom were relatively unknown at the time, are excellent as the reformed outlaw and cocky kid; the latter's tragic and pathetic death-scene is particularly well played. The backbone of the movie though is Hackman, who dominates everything as Herod, one of the most horrible but convincing heavies in any movie; he's thoroughly rotten (at one point he screams at the townsfolk, ""This is my town ! If you live to see the dawn, it's because I allow it !!"") but multi-faceted - he's cultured and intelligent but has a complete disdain for morality, and his attraction to Cort (Crowe) is almost undisguised homosexuality. It's a fabulous cast. There is marvellous photography by Dante Spinotti and a brilliant score by the talented Alan Silvestri, which is a part-Morricone, part-Hollywood mix of lush orchestral tone and jarring percussion. For my money this is one of the very best modern westerns - a traditional tale with a cool gender twist and a story that nicely balances the obligatory set-pieces with interesting, explosive characters. Not to be missed. Shot at Old Tuscon Studios in Arizona, and dedicated to veteran tough-guy Strode (Spartacus, Once Upon A Time In The West), who plays the coffin-maker measuring Stone for size at the start. The title of this movie is a quote from The Bible (1 Peter, chapter 4) and has been used as the title of several other unrelated films, songs and books (notably a 1973 novel by Louis L'Amour).",The Quick and the Dead

It's the story of a female gunfighter who returns to a frontier town where a dueling tournament is being held, which she enters in an effort to avenge her father's death.The trouble is that it's doesn't really work at all .Basically it's the World Cup of gun fighting set over a few days .Sixteen expert gunfighters , of which all winners go through to the next round .The problem is that you know before the gunfights , who's going to win because it's the lead actors .Also why would anyone ever enter a competition where the loser dies especially a gunfighter , who isn't what he's claiming to be ?The other problem I have is that Sharon Stone is never convincing as a woman out for revenge and neither is Leonardo DiCaprio as the Kid because he looks exactly that. He looks twelve .I love Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe. Both make the film worth watching but considering there are eleven gun fights , they do get a bit tedious, although I know Director Sam Rami tried to vary them all.As westerns go , this is a little bit too light hearted despite the death count but I was never not entertained by it.",The Quick and the Dead
50,Samiam3,Raimi goes West,7,16 August 2009,"With The Quick and the Dead, Sam Raimi approaches the old west with a very new/contemporary style. With its brisk energy and competitive characters, the story often feels like a sports movie with lots of photography tricks. If you want a top western, this might not be your film, but if what you seek you is good old pistol-whippin' American fun, this might do the trick.Thanks to James Cameron, since T2, there has been nothing sexier than a woman with a gun. Sharon Stone actually brings a fairly macho 'Sarah Conner' quality to her character. She plays Ellen, a young cowgirl who rides into a mysterious town for a very special event, a gunslinging competition. The mayor of the town is a dangerous fella and one of the most feared gunslingers around. It is this man who Ellen is after. The question is, why? In order to fight him, she must beat everyone else in the competition. There will be blood, for sure.In order to make up for his superficial plot, Sam Raimi has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. One of his most recognizable through his career is going over the top in an amusing way, which he does here too, mostly at the climax. He doesn't make great movies, but he makes clever and entertaining ones, which this is.",The Quick and the Dead
51,triple8,Don't mess with Sharon,7,19 May 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Ambivalence describes my feelings for Quick and The dead. I both liked and didn't like the movie at times, it was a sort of constant back and forth with me. Ultimately though I gave it a 7 for good. It would be a low 7 Though, because there really were times I wanted to turn this off.The good things: Number one is, of coarse, the cinematography. I don't think anyone, even while they may really dislike the movie, could argue with the stunning beauty of the movie in general.I also admired the way the movie was able to build tension. It may have been predictable but that doesn't mean I wasn't on the edge of my seat by the end. That's kind of what a good movie should do and it did that. The movie always smoldered with tension. While I may have wanted to turn it off, I couldn't. I had to know how it ended.Lastly, is the acting. Contrary to many opinions on here, I liked Stone in this role. I thought not only was she good but excellent. She gave her character a toughness and lent her a spirited touch another actress may not have been able to do. I think that Stone is better playing a role like this then the femme fetale, she shows more range as the don't mess with me cowgirl. I throughly and completely enjoyed the performances by Stone and everyone in this movie.Now-the negatives. Or main negative. The lack of ANYTHING. Nothing much happens through the movie-nothing- except daily shootouts.Oh and of coarse, constant close ups of the REAL star of this movie and unsung hero-the clock. Now I know this is a western, I've seen westerns before, but most have more going on then this. I don't think the plot lacked depth but the way it was carried out sure did. Would it have hurt to include a little more dialog? A little more SOMETHING? I actually thought Stone was a bit underused. Such a great cast, great scenery, so little lack of anything except guns and clocks....I think Quick and the Dead was a good movie that could have been a classic. As it is however, it's a moderately interesting performance driven western with stunning visuals and a whale of an ending. Had it's pluses but wouldn't go down as one of my favorites. Thi is however, the best I've ever seen Stone.",The Quick and the Dead
52,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,I blame Clint Eastwood,4,27 April 2017,"The Man With No Name is credited with reviving the Western with the glorious Unforgiven, which starred, among others, Gene Hackman. ''Duck, I says,'' being my favorite line, though ''I don't deserve this. I was building a house,'' is more often quoted because it's followed by ''deserve's got nothing to do with it,'' which has pretty much become an an aphorism. But Hollywood being Hollywood and Gene Hackman desperately needing a backyard swimming pool (I assume) along comes The Quick and the Dead only a few years later. Whereas Director Eastwood made us face the myths of the West, Director Raimi turns them into a cartoon. The whole movie plays like a bunch of pretty-boy Hollywood actors dressing up to play guns. There was more gritty reality in The Three Amigos. Hackman is so embarrassing that his shtick here retrospectively takes some shine off his brilliant turn in Unforgiven. I'd go as far as to say this is the worst big-budget Western of the past 50 years and that includes Silverado, Dancing with Wolves, anything else involving Kevin Costner, anything involving the Gunfight at the OK Corral, and Cowboys and Aliens (or whatever that mess was called).",The Quick and the Dead
53,lemon_magic,"Paper thin, completely clichéd, but still much better than it should be.",7,16 July 2005,"TQATD shamelessly assembles every cliché of the 'Revenge' Spaghetti Western genre and milks them until their udders are chapped. But there is so much energy here, and so many good-to-great actors doing great work, that the movie turns out to be quite a lot of irresponsible fun.My only initial qualm was in the choice of Sharon Stone as the central protagonist for the story, but I need not have worried. The script and the dialog plays to her strengths as an actress - Stone's one-note combination of Barbie Doll good looks and muted, bitter anger fits the character perfectly, and she looks just right under the Stetson. I haven't cared for her in a lot of movies, but she's perfectly fine here.And geez, you've hardly ever seen such a great cast. Gene Hackman, Lance Henricksen, Keith David, Russell Crowe, Leonard Dicaprio, and seemingly dozens of great minor character actors, all give damned near perfect performances that suit the material. And Raimi uses almost all of his now-famous camera tricks and signature zooms to punch up the scenes and keep the visual interest high. Hackman, especially, lifts the movie up a couple of notches, as a villain so gleefully bad and charismatic that it's a pleasure to see him work.So: don't go to this movie looking for original writing, or depth, or anything more that the standard gunfight clichés. But you can expect to get a lot of enjoyment from the vigor and panache that informs all the clichés.",The Quick and the Dead
54,Sandcooler,Ingenious modern western,9,10 April 2010,"I have an undying fondness for westerns, even despite the fact that they are always roughly the same thing. Hell, maybe even because they're always the same thing. Is there a more beautiful shot than the obligatory angel of vengeance standing in a pool of sun and giving us a dreamy look that's filled with regret and melancholia? Sharon Stone may not have been the ideal lead for this movie, but the close-up shots of her eyes are still as effective as can be. Besides, her tough attitude isn't as fake as some have stated, it just isn't on par with the true greats. What I like most about this movie is the incredibly simplistic plot though. I love how the movie actually centers around a gun-fighting competition, talk about no nonsense. No need for excuses to have people shoot at each other, they just make that the central plot and call it a day. The storyline about Herod's past with Cort is very interesting as well, because it makes the few occasions on which good things happen to Cort so worthwhile. The ending is standard fare for the genre, but frankly I wouldn't want it any other way. Raimi pretty much made the prototype of a western for the 21st century, a wonderful homage to the genre.",The Quick and the Dead
55,winner55,doesn't cut it,6,13 January 2009,"The post-modern Western, as a kind of parasitic sub-genre of the Western, began as self-conscious parody of the Western. The precursors were films like The Marx Brothers Go West and Bob Hope's Paleface - films set in the 19th century but including references to events of the 194os. But the post-modern really began to come out on its own as afterthought to the Spaghetti Western, the formula for which included larger-than-life caricatures of the traditional Hollywood Western. The best known of these early Post-Mod Westerns were the Trinity films, but there was actually a more successful American variant from about the same time (early 1970s), Support Your Local Sheriff.Notice that all the films mentioned so far have been comedies. For some reason, the makers of Post-Mod Westerns soon began taking themselves seriously, as heavily ironic commentary on the politics of the day - think El Topo, Dirty Little Billy, Doc. Most of these were failures - El Topo once considered a cult film, is virtually unwatchable now.But the serious Post-Mods did leave a legacy. Since the mid-1980s, a number of films have deployed the same heavy irony, although politics is no longer a major concern. Among the first noticeable of these revised Post-Mods was the 'Brat Pack'version of the Billy the Kid story, Young Guns. This film sold very well, but largely due to the all-star cast involved; most critics did recognize a deeper problem with it, that it was difficult to determine what of it was serious, what comedic, and what just pure self-indulgence, as in the infamous peyote sequence (which, already bad, nonetheless left such an impression it got redone in Tony Scott's abysmal Domino).This problem now really defines the Post-Mod Western. Watching these films, are we indulging in a fantasy, the plot and themes to be taken seriously despite the irony? Or is the irony simply a cheap and easy form of over-intellectualized comedy? The lack of any clear answer is the real lasting impression any of these films leave with us.Sam Raimi is one of the more interesting of our truly independent directors, all the more so because he has remained largely with the B-movie genres and knows them all pretty well. So, especially given such a remarkable cast to work with, has he given us a Post Mod Western that avoids the unsatisfying lack of resolution we find in most of these? Although there are interesting moments in The Quick and the Dead, I'm afraid the answer is a solid negative.It is notable - even annoyingly so - that the best moments of this film are precisely those that easily fit the traditional Western, or even Spaghetti Western, grooves, without pandering to anything Post-Mod - the real pain Stone's character evidences, the beautiful exterior photography of a desolated cemetery, the dramatic confrontations between Hackman and Crowe and between Hackman and Stone.Why didn't Raime realize what he had with these actors? But he doesn't; he is so intent on turning in a stylistic tour-de-force that the great cast here is largely wasted. Ultimately he asks less of them than they have to offer. The drama is drowned out by visual excess, and the absurdities of the plot are pushed to the envelope rather than carefully restrained.It's an okay action film, worth a view. But this has proved not to be the next big thing people touted it as 13 years ago, and for a very real reason - it is pure Post-Mod Western, and frankly, I think we've all grown tired of it.I don't know that the Western genre can ever get resurrected; but it's now clear that it never passed the torch to the Post-Mod western genre as its 'logical inheritor.' Frankly I think we will see Western themes continue to appear in gangster films - The Road to Perdition, Four Brothers, American Gangsters - these have been the real cowboy movies of the past decade or so.The Quick and the Dead doesn't cut it, sorry.(Thanks to johnno for salvaging these mutterings from the wastebasket at work. And I agree about Brothers in Arms, same problem.)",The Quick and the Dead
56,philip_vanderveken,"The good, the bad and the pretty",7,31 January 2005,"Even though I've never been a fan of Westerns, I can name you a few titles in the genre that I really like. All these movies have something in common: They aren't exactly typical Westerns. I mean, it isn't about the poor settlers and cowboys being surrounded by the Indians, shooting those wild and ferocious primitives down like dogs and teaching them some good moral values (The typical John Wayne stuff if you don't exactly know what I mean). No, I like movies that have a story to tell and that don't have to follow that typical ""Cowboys vs.Indians""-rule. Once Upon A Time in the West is my absolute favorite in the genre, followed by The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but I sure can appreciate movies like The Quick and the Dead as well.I have to admit that I was a bit sceptical about it at first. I mean, Sharon Stone has never been my favorite actress, but knowing that you'll see her play a gunfighter in a Western can certainly be called a challenge. So I decided to give it a try and I was pleasantly surprised by it. OK, it may never become a real classic, but it certainly kept my attention. The story focuses on 'The Lady' or Ellen as we will find out later. She's an unknown female gunslinger visiting a dusty town in the middle of the desert. She has a good, but secret reason for showing up, one day before a gunfighting competition will take place in the little town. They will fight for a huge amount of money. One by one the men will fight and die until only one survives and takes it all. But not everybody has come for the money, some seek revenge for a crime that has been done to them a long time ago...This movie is really full of stars, people who you don't exactly expect to see in this kind of movies. Leonardo DiCaprio, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe... They all have found a suiting part in this movie. Even though it isn't always very realistic and although not all performances are always as convincing (I expected more from DiCaprio, but really loved Gene Hackman as the ultimate bad guy), this movie certainly isn't as bad as I expected it to be. I reward it with a 7/10. It's one of the better Westerns I've ever seen.",The Quick and the Dead
57,Gislef,Wimpy Heroine messes this up,6,13 January 2000,"I don't mind a female gunfighter.  I don't even necessarily mind Sharon Stone in this movie.  The problem is they don't seem to have a clue as to what her character is supposed to be, and Sharon doesn't have a clue as to how to play it.Is Ellen a tough skilled gunfighter?  Well, maybe.  It takes her six shots or so to shoot Cort's noose.  But she doesn't seem to have ever _shot_ anyone.  She doesn't want to kill anyone, and even takes her own sweet time shooting Herod (fingering her gun suggestively a couple of time before being interrupted).  How did she become a gunfighter without killing anyone?  And if she did, why is she so reluctant now?  Particularly when it comes to Herod.  Revolvers _ain't_ that precise - are we supposed to believe she never killed anyone (even accidentally) in all the gunfights she has (presumably) had to reach her current skill and reputation?Okay, so she's the sensitive, caring would-be gunfighter that hasn't actually been in a fight before.  But then...ummm, how did she become as skilled as we're supposed to believe she is (and as she demonstrates later when taking out Herod in the final showdown).So half the time Stone is playing a female Clint Eastwood, and the other half a 80's kinda sensitive woman.  It's confusing as all get-out, as you can imagine (or have seen for yourself).Since Stone's character lies at the heart of the movie, we're totally confused.  She is surrounded by some competent, likeable performances and interesting characters (De Caprio, Henriksen, Ketih David), and she even manages to hold her own against Hackman (who has a few character moments despite being the blackest bad guy ever).And yes, Raimi does lots of clever things with the camera.  But it's Stone's character that really bothers me.  The writers just couldn't seem to make up their mind about her, and it shows.",The Quick and the Dead

It's probably better described as a thriller with a western setting, it's easier to enjoy the movie that way.Anyway, i thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it as a decent thriller.

59,MartianOctocretr5,Brutal high-stakes tournament,8,27 August 2009,"A lot of westerns have supported their plot on the legendary test of wills, a duel-to-the-death gunfight. However, few have made multiple gunfights as much of a backbone for the story as this one does.Every character is well developed, and represents a clear metaphor. Look for a battalion of excellent actors: Gene Hackman, Leo Dicaprio, and Russell Crowe are the marquee standouts, although their dominance of the film makes gunfight outcomes easily predictable. It's a bit of a Roman gladiator death match, except with guns replacing swords. It's (literally) a single elimination tournament, where losers (after the first round) pay a rather high price. Winners are not declared winners until they make sure the opponent is no longer breathing. It's puzzling what some of the contestants were thinking when they signed up.Hackman is effective as the satanic character (his name is Herod, of all things), who savagely and brutally intimidates a desert nowhere town. He even has two specially attired murderous guards, a reference to Hitler. Crowe is a fallen angel; a preacher who has compromised his faith, and Dicaprio is Herod's cocky and arrogant son. Sharon Stone as a vengeful wraith gives the only weak performance among the major roles. Even worse than her acting is her woefully poor and unconvincing shooting ability. A person with two broken arms could draw faster and shoot straighter.The final four gunfighters left standing in the competition are extremely predictable, but the film gets away with it. This is due to the strength of the characters, and their interacting relationships. It's also pretty obvious who will face off with whom, and the red herring that is employed is not concealed well at all. It's about as obvious as guessing who is buried in Grant's tomb.Except for a few plot holes already noted, it's written well. It's skillfully directed, and usually well acted. The themes and structure are well managed, and the resolution is satisfying. Mostly good entertainment for western fans or mainstream movie viewers.",The Quick and the Dead

It's a fun western movie that we don't see anymore.  Paying homage to certain Eastwood movies too.If you want to see a movie like this .... it's highly recommended.  Not as serious as say Silverado.  (one of the best movies ever made) but it'll give you your fix. :)  ---- man did Sharon Stone rock in here.  Only problem was I couldn't tell who was the bigger character.

63,TheUnknown837-1,fun and entertaining Western by Sam Raimi,8,15 January 2007,"Oscar nominee Sharon Stone and Oscar winners Gene Hackman and Russell Crowe star in this Sam Raimi Western flick, which I can only describe as ""fun"". It isn't what I would call a ""serious"" Western, but it doesn't get dull or boring. And it has this unique, gunslinger style where all of the characters are smart-mouthed and excellent aims, able to score direct hits while firing at the most impossible positions. Of course, nobody in the real West could fire a six-gun across their shoulder and strike a target over a hundred yards away, but it was cool with Russell Crowe did that with TWO six-guns.The film is about a gunslinger, who turns out to be a woman seeking the man who was indirectly responsible for her father's death. She finds him as the dictator of a town in the Old West. And he is hosting an elimination tournament for anybody willing to enter. He brings a former gunslinger, now turned preacher, and forces him into the contest as well. And overtime, the contest rules begin to unfairly change....Overall, it was a fairly good film. I do admit that maybe the last few minutes were a little bit over-emphasized in certain points and maybe seemed a little bit too eerie. Still, it's compelling and a good watch.",The Quick and the Dead
64,mentalcritic,"The end of Sam Raimi, the innovator",4,6 June 2007,"In 1995, Sam Raimi had become known as the director of a rather quirky and original horror film that, in spite of being shot full frame with terrible actors, displayed a talent for composition not seen in some time. However, he had also given himself a rather large black mark in the form of an attempt to be ""cool"" with a horror-comedy where violence has no visible consequences, and everyone speaks like a reject from a teen soap opera. Individuals singing Raimi's praises will have you believe such was the best thing Raimi had done at the time. Unfortunately, what it really was was Raimi demonstrating that he had run out of ideas that he could call his own, and was now getting his repertoire fed to him by the most disingenuous money-men of the industry. In spite of a heroic attempt a few years later to return to the style of creating characters with The Gift, The Quick And The Dead can be labelled the moment where Sam Raimi, the innovative new voice behind The Evil Dead or Darkman, was gone forever.While it is all but taken as read that a Sam Raimi film will be a hamfest with more clichés than a film-making class nowadays, nobody was quite prepared for how he displayed the fact in The Quick And The Dead. They say that when you put together a film in which the characters are the story, you best have good actors behind them. Unfortunately, with the exceptions of Russell Crowe, Lance Henriksen, and Gene Hackman, every actor in this film comes off as being utterly terrible. Even Lance, who by this time had the making of great characters out of terrible scripts down to an art, comes off as a complete non-entity here. Hence, I have no hesitation at all in placing a share of the blame upon writer Simon Moore. For all of his faults, Raimi at least knows how to salvage a character in the editing process. And when your cast includes the men who played Bishop or Lex Luthor, it is hard to blame the problem on the actors. Henriksen's performance, however, will get the more ignorant placing the blame on the cast.Sharon Stone makes that an easy mistake to make, unfortunately. From the second she enters the town set, she makes it abundantly clear that she has seen one too many Sergio Leone films and thought ""I can do that"". And to be fair, for those who have not seen The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly or Once Upon A Time In The West, Stone appears to be doing a good job. Compounding the problem, however, is that neither writer nor director seem to have any idea which scenes they should not be stealing from. The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gob-smacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end. It was literally the final word. Unfortunately, Raimi tries to one-up Leone's signature scene in a flashback where Hackman forces Stacy Linn Ramsower as the young Ellen to shoot her father dead. Not only is the tone of the scene entirely off, the total absence of any proper lead-up completely undercuts the drama of the sequence.Equally terrible is Leonardo DiCaprio as Fee, or The Kid as he is called during the film. DiCaprio has finally proved in such pieces as Blood Diamond or The Departed that he can act, but after The Quick And The Dead, anyone could be forgiven for thinking DiCaprio came straight from a high school drama. During the entire film, The Kid is only a whiny brat who starts to bawl when things do not entirely go his way. When he meets his end, the scene is so perfunctory, so devoid of weight, that while Hackman lends some much-needed credibility with his totally unmoved reactions, Stone destroys the whole thing with some incredible overacting. It is not entirely DiCaprio's or even Stone's fault, as the script gives them absolutely no development or buildup for this moment. DiCaprio is clearly in over his head playing a character that the writer and director apparently could not give two figs about. The sad thing is that with all the weight Stone was throwing around on the set, it would have done wonders if she had recognised this problem and addressed it.This partly leads me to believe others may be right when they say that The Quick And The Dead needed another hour of footage (or script) in order to accomplish its goals. With more time and development in the early stages, the constant parade of characters both minor and major could have had some impact. Unfortunately, with very few exceptions, and minor ones at that, the deaths in The Quick And The Dead are merely a parade of images. Perhaps The Quick And The Uninteresting would have been a more appropriate title. And when one remembers that this film was put together by the same man who gave us such a haunting, creepy atmosphere in The Evil Dead, or such a horrifyingly real tragic hero in Darkman, it makes The Quick And The Dead such a bitter pill to swallow. Not that we honestly could have expected much more. The Western as a genre has been thoroughly tapped out, and it would take a truly incredible film to give it new life. The kind of film that The Quick And The Dead is not.The Quick And The Dead is a four out of ten film. I have seen plenty of films that are worse, but in light of what its director used to be capable of, I have seen very few that are so incredibly frustrating.",The Quick and the Dead
65,reddiemurf81,Good western revenge film by Raimi,6,17 January 2021,"I saw this on cable way back in the late 90s, before I really paid attention to directors, composers, and whatnot.

Solid 6.5!!",The Quick and the Dead
66,hnt_dnl,Rare guilty pleasure from the 90s!,8,14 January 2012,"Most of my ""guilty pleasure"" movies reside solely in the 80s, the decade in which I grew up. There are so many movies from that era that are simply enjoyable and entertain me to this day. In the 90s, movies started to get ""serious"" again, so it tends to get tagged as one of the best decades of film. I would debate that argument, as I don't think that ""serious"" always equates to ""great"". While the 90s boasts many quality films, I find several of the highly touted ones somewhat overrated. Plus, there are not nearly as many ""entertaining"" films in the 90s as there were in the 80s! But this film, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD (1995) is a rarity, a slip-in-the-crack, rip-roaring entertaining, re-watchable flick from the 90s! While this movie is totally cliché and a rip-off of just about any classic Western one can think of, it is a tale told with 100% flair and has a style and attitude that is sadly lacking in movies nowadays. Interestingly, the main actors playing their roles in a straight, serious manner that effectively counters the over-the-top stylistic atmosphere and tone of the movie, giving the film a so-bad-it's-good quality.Sharon Stone stars (looking absolutely stunning!) is the antihero of this Western. In a role reversal, this movie is an early example of using a female as the hero in a genre that was traditionally reserved only for male heroes. As previously stated, Stone plays it straight, in a similar solemn, somber manner that prior male actors essayed such roles. Stone's character, the mysterious Ellen, is a stranger that arrives in a small town run by the totally corrupt Herod (played deliciously by the great Gene Hackman). Although the cliché, over-the-top bad guy, I actually enjoyed Hackman's villainous Western character here more so than I did in Unforgiven. In particular, Hackman delivers 2 memorable speeches, the first speech delivered to the entire town after they hired a gunslinger to come to town to try to beat him in the tournament (this situation was a total mimic of Unforgiven where the vengeful prostitutes hired Richard Harris' character to come to town to kill the cowboys who slashed their friend's face), but Hackman's speech here is delivered with so much more flair, matching the stylistic approach of the film. The second speech is one he gives to the preacher-gunslinger character Cort late in the movie where he literally foams at the mouth at the idea of taking on the best gunslinger in the territory.The gunslinger-turned-preacher Cort is played by none other than Russell Crowe and another key character gunsmith-wannabe-gunslinger The Kid is played by Leonardo DiCaprio (before they both became Hollywood superstars!). Both actors, while playing 2nd fiddle to Stone and Hackman, who are the stars of this proceeding, still have some really good moments of their own. Crowe's strong, silent-type character was a prototype for future roles that he would excel at and DiCaprio seemed to be having fun playing a young, Billy-the-Kid type character in a flick, a welcome side trip from the more serious movies he was doing at the time.The movie also benefits from being supported by a group of veteran actors who stylishly play a collection of nefarious figures (Lance Henriksen as the braggart gunslinger Ace, Keith David as the snobby gunfighter Cantrell, Tobin Bell as the sleazy grifter Dog Kelly, and Kevin Conway as the scuzzy Dred). The great, reliable Pat Hingle is also fine as the good-natured, but timid barkeep Horace, who, like the rest of the good townsfolk, sadly turns the other cheek when it comes to the antics of Herrod and the sleazy denizens.Sam Raimi (Evil Dead and Spiderman series) directed this movie with a panache and flair that is very infectious. Lots of camera angles, zoom-in-and-out shots, close-ups, and tension-filled music really gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and make the characters seem larger-than-life. The movie itself will remind the viewer of classic Westerns such as Eastwood's High Plains Drifter, and Leone's spaghetti Westerns Once Upon a Time in the West, For a Few Dollars More, and A Fistful of Dollars. There is a lot of dialogue that is in the background, seeming to pay homage to Leone's Westerns where actors were dubbed and Stone's character is very reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's Man-With-No-Name in Leone's spaghetti Westerns.Overall, I actually enjoyed The Quick and the Dead more than the more well-received, acclaimed Tombstone, which came out a couple of years earlier. Tombstone took itself seriously and failed in certain parts. The Quick and the Dead knows what it is, an homage to classic Westerns, with a modern sensibility and self-deprecating sense of humor. I think I'll take The Quick and the Dead!",The Quick and the Dead
67,Bob-45,Much Better Than I Expected,6,8 May 2005,"At times unintentionally funny, with underwritten, over=the=top characters, and all but one of its best scenes stolen from better westerns (most notably ""Fistfull of Dollars"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), ""The Quick and the Dead"" is still worthwhile, thanks most to colorful performances by Lance Henriksen and Gene Hackman, and a really fine performance by Russell Crowe. Sharon Stone holds her own with some genuinely superior talent, giving credence in her scenes of fear and doubt, while gently parodying Clint Eastwood in her more confident scenes. While Stone's identity is known by the town doctor (fine character turn by Robers Blossom), she is the ""woman with no name"" to the rest. The one original action scene in ""TQATD"" is a real corker, standing along side the opening of ""Silverado"" and some of James Coburn's bits of business in ""The Magnificent Seven"" for sheer exhilaration. While the story is not particularly strong or always well directed, Sam Raimi has made a worthwhile, watchable homage to Leone.

The characters were unusual and definitely ahistorical, but it wasn't supposed to be anything other than an offbeat fantasy western, so that was just fine; unfortunately the characters were not only eccentric, but also pretty much flat as a board in terms of character development. It was nearly impossible to really care about anybody in this movie, and it just highlighted the fact that Sharon Stone, while beautiful, is nothing special as an actress. The plot is also, on the whole, very predictable. I really, really do wish though that after DiCaprio went down in this movie it had been just a touch more real and he had never gotten up again--then I wouldn't still be suffering with the rest of his career both on and off the screen.

The person who murdered her father is none other than the ruler of this town and competition (John Herod who is played by John Herod). While this film isn't really that good, there are some great moments that shows the future greatness of Sam Raimi when he does Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Other than that, you get to see a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio who does his best in the role that was given him.

72,bellino-angelo2014,"A different Western, and in a good way",7,21 February 2021,"Sam Raimi is considered one of the greatest directors of horror movies (and also for the SPIDERMAN trilogy) and I liked most of his movies. I heard for years about this movie and a month ago I finally watched it. It just surprised me a bit.A female gunslinger simply known as Ellen (Sharon Stone) comes to the Western town of Redemption in search of John Herod (Gene Hackman), the evil town boss that is also the responsible of her father's death when she was still a small girl since her dad was a sheriff. Herod indicts a tournament every year for elect the fastest gun in town and at the moment nobody has ever defeated him. Ellen participates despite being a woman for the prize of 123,000 dollars. In the meanwhile she meets the illegitimate son of Herod nicknamed The Kid (Leonardo di Caprio) and also Cort (Russell Crowe), a former gunslinger that decided to become a priest after all Herod did. In the tournament many folks die and when only Ellen and Cort are left as the duelists there is a surprise ending: lots of explosions strike the city and when Herod is kinda paralized on the ground Ellen arrives from nowhere and finally remembers what happened to her father and manages to kill Herod finally freeing the town after years of tyranny. In the end Cort becomes the new Sheriff and Ellen leaves the semi-destroyed town.This was a different Western as the lead is a woman that enters a gunslinging tournament and also because is quite bloody in spots (so parents, think twice before showing this movie to your kids as few of the killings turned me off a bit and they even managed to lose a few points for the final score). The script a few times was very unplausible and hard to believe and some might not get it until the very end.The cast is quite odd for a modern Western: Sharon Stone is very good as the female gunslinger thirsty for revenge. Russell Crowe (here in his first American debut) gives a very credible performance and even a then-unknown Leonardo di Caprio shines in one of his first known roles. Gene Hackman is as always a delight as the villain and his performance is a bit reminiscent of THE UNFORGIVEN (of three years prior). The supporting cast is quite a treat: Lance Henriksen (that as almost always dies of a spectacular death), Keith David (with his unmistakable deep voice of his), Pat Hingle, Mark Boone Junior, Roberts Blossom, Gary Sinise (in the flashback scenes), Bruce Campbell and even Woody Strode in his final movie give some of their most memorable performances in their long and respected careers. Sam Raimi directs nicely with his usual slick and stylish cinematography.Worth seeing not only for Western fans despite some very gory death scenes (and I mentioned them above).",The Quick and the Dead

The movie suffers from the fact that it is too serious for it's own good and not too much fun as it wants to be. I think that the story they got here deserved a serious movie . Serious western . Unfortunately , Raimi decided to do a pastiche . It was a wrong move , because there isn't too much fun moments here . The movie lacks heart , despite some real potential . Raimi never allows the viewer to take his moment seriously , so all the serious moments are emotionally flat and wasted . In the end what we've got here is a unconvincing pastiche that isn't too much interesting .

Those wishing a deeper meaning can easily find a satanic - angelic confrontation because it certainly has those features as well. One reviewer even calls it a comedy-western, but I don't see that at all. This is one of the best-acted films I've seen in a long time. It should be - with stars like Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe and Leonardo di Caprio in it. Stone is gorgeous and, of course, on the ""good"" side (the fore-mentioned angel?).

Each of the characters, even Hackman's villain Herod, is so likeable and charismatic that you can't help but feeling sad that a good portion of them will be killed. There is some spectacular cinematography and creatively conceived shots from director Sam Raimi and his team. A particularly memorable shot is the one of the sunlight shining through the bullet hole of the victim's head. In my opinion the two drawbacks of The Quick and the Dead are the thin plot and the relative scarcity of dialogue. With a cast like this it's a bit of a shame that it is underutilized.

I know this is a film by Sam Raimi, who has a penchant for weirdness sometimes, but this is too weird for me, I'm sorry to say. Weird is not always good, as is the case here.The acting is bad, despite the usually good actors. I think maybe the director is to blame or perhaps the writers.

81,DavidSim240183,Stone may be a sharp-shooter. But this is Hackman's show,8,12 June 2007,"I'm not much of a fan of Westerns, but I am a fan of Sam Raimi. The Quick and the Dead came at a time in Raimi's career when he started gravitating to slightly more mainstream fare. Before that, he was known more for fantasy and horror like the bizarre but entertaining Evil Dead films, and the quite extraordinary dark avenger film Darkman.But the Hollywood mainstream genre is not always something Raimi feels at home in. And his output in the mid to late 90s has been a little disappointing. First off was TQATD which was a box-office flop. Then he rebounded with the superb crime thriller A Simple Plan, his best film of the 90s. But then floundered with two hideously dull films For Love of the Game, and the surprisingly boring clairvoyant thriller The Gift, a film that had none of the pizazz of Raimi's earliest efforts. He then regained strength with the increasingly brilliant Spider-Man trilogy.And although TQATD was one of Raimi's less successful endeavours, its actually quite enjoyable. Raimi may have created one of the quirkiest Westerns ever made. Its filled with his trademark dizzying whip-pans and close-ups. And he infuses it with an appealing kinetic energy that helps the film gallop along at a cracking pace.Starring and co-producing, Sharon Stone is Ellen, the mysterious gunslinger who rides into the town of Redemption on a personal vendetta. She has an old score to settle with Herod (Gene Hackman on fine vindictive form), the villainous mayor of Redemption. He holds sway over the townspeople with an iron fist, and he has quite an ingenious method of rooting out his enemies.Every year, the town holds a tournament where the best gunfighters square off against one another for an enormous cash prize. But no one ever wins. Because Herod is the fastest gun in Redemption. And he can out-draw anyone. Ellen intends to change that. So the gunfighters sign up. Including Herod's son, the Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), and a former outlaw turned preacher, Cort (a pre-stardom Russell Crowe).Although TQATD is quite slim plot-wise, its a bit hard not to get carried away by the film. The eclectic cast goes some way towards making the film more enjoyable than it should be. Its nice to see Sharon Stone trying to shake typecasting as a sex symbol. In fact I never thought it possible that someone as beautiful as Sharon Stone could look so weatherbeaten, but it seems it is. Even so, she is an actress with a limited range, and her stolid performance is a fundamental flaw that works against the film.Everyone else in the cast looks like they're having a grand old time. But Stone walks around the set trying to sap the fun out of every scene. And as such, its difficult to root for her as a heroine. Even a burned out wreck like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had a wry sense of humour.Its in the supporting cast where we get some vitality. Gene Hackman steals the film right out from under everyone else as the monstrous Herod. He's clearly having a ball as the lord and master of Redemption. He shoots people with nary a glance. And he loves antagonising Cort.Cort used to ride with Herod's gang of outlaws, but changed his ways and became a preacher. Herod loves making an example of him, putting him on public display, trying to get him to embrace his dark side. Those scenes are reminiscent of Darkman, about another inherently decent man who found himself giving in to his destructive urges.Russell Crowe spends most of the film chained up and dragged along saloon floors and dirt, but its a quietly intense performance on his part. And he knows his way around a shooting iron.And then there's Leonardo DiCaprio as the Kid. DiCaprio is an actor who tends to do best when his enthusiasm and cocky charisma is really allowed to shine. And the slick, trigger-happy Kid is a character perfectly suited to his acting style. He's a real sharp-shooter, who fires off wisecracks just as hard and fast. Although I think his character arc could have done without the subplot about wanting to prove himself to his old man. It makes his death a little odd, and even unintentionally mawkish.But there are other pleasures to be found in the wonderful variations Raimi gets out of the different gunfights. There's some amazing camera angles, like a POV shot through a bullet wound. There are too many to recall, but its a constant source of interest what Raimi will cook up next. And the musical score from Alan Silvestri recalls many a Spaghetti Western.Good ending too with the exploding clock tower, the haunting flashback into Ellen's past, and Herod's last stand. The Quick and the Dead will never be a classic like some other Westerns, but I found it a lot of fun, a nice change of pace for Sam Raimi, and a reaffirmation of why Gene Hackman is one of the finest actors in the world.",The Quick and the Dead

She arrives at the beginning of an extreme gun competition with VERY high stakes. There can be only one winner, and a lot of losers. 2 of the competitors include Cort (Russell Crowe), who is held prisoner by Herod, and The Kid (Young Leonardo DiCaprio)who enjoys his position in the contest. Sam Raimi, breaking out of the shadow of the ""Evil Dead"" series, does a good job with the film (Using a lot of his trademark shots).

83,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Well-crafted, mildly campy Western adventure",8,27 July 2006,"Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead is one of those films that me and my girlfriends set out to watch one night in 1997, when we were all hopelessly smitten with heartthrob Leonardo Dicaprio from having seen Titanic earlier that year. We watched it only for him which was both a foolish and smart thing to do. For one, Leonardo is not in this film for very long but on the other hand, it was a very entertaining Western even without his presence. In fact, looking back at it, I'm thankful that annoying overemoting brat didn't have a bigger part.The biggest part in the film is actually given to Sharon Stone, who plays something of a female Clint Eastwood -- a rough gunslinger who seeks revenge on her father's killer in dirty depressing little Western town where he runs everything. This place, its inhabitants and above all its gunfighting competition are so corrupt that it demands reform, and this is where the, for ONCE, superbly sexy Russel Crowe comes in as Cort, the preacher who is forced to turn back to his violent ways. Sound clichéd enough for a Western plot? This film will surprise you with a little more depth, a few extra story lines and a lot more fun.The Quick and the Dead is well-crafted campy Western fun, but it is cleverly disguised as an action-drama so the dialogue is kept reasonable, the violence realistic and the worst of clichés to a minimum. This means you probably won't be able to laugh at it for sheer camp -- only smile and enjoy its Western clichés and awesome gunfighting duels. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film; it delivers on every level for what it sets out to do and it does so with edge and style.8/10",The Quick and the Dead
84,lathe-of-heaven,"Like many others have stated; a well crafted, stylish film, and a HELL of a lot of fun! Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10",9,4 November 2013,"I truly do not understand the polarized reviews here; with many films I can see why people would be divided in their opinions, and I usually comment on that. However, this movie is pretty clear in it's intent and style and would appear to me to be a straight forward entertaining Western with the added modern touch of Sam Raimi's clever eye and talent. Some here have REALLY slammed him specifically as the director, and I haven't a clue as to why the hell they hate him so much.Like I almost ALWAYS say, if you are going to bother to write a review about a film, PLEASE choose Genres and movies that you LIKE in general so that you can give a fair and informative review to other people who ALSO LIKE the same type of films. I know I've said this before, but for example, I personally have absolutely NO interest in Torture Porn and it's like, BUT I won't come here and p*ss all over films like that just because I don't like them. It would be totally pointless for me to write a review in a Genre that I despise; how the hell would that be helpful to others who DO like those kinds of films and come here to read reviews to give them some idea as to whether they would like a movie or not...???Sorry, I guess I'll just never really understand the people who write reviews here. If you hate Raimi, then don't come here and $h!t all over his films. If you DO happen to like fun, stylish Action / Western films with excellent performances and in my lowly and wretched opinion, AWESOME direction that weaves the entire style of the film together beautifully and effectively, then YES, please by all means come here and write about THAT kind of film and simply tell us whether it is done well or not. Geez...Also, someone else entitled their review 'Splatter Western', which couldn't possibly be farther from the truth. If you want that kind of Western, just watch some of Sam Peckinpah's extremely violent and graphic films. I feel that Raimi was quite restrained considering that he is the author of 'THE EVIL DEAD'; and quite honestly I think that if he HAD gone that route, it would have been a completely different film and in my unworthy estimation, would have greatly diminished the awesome movie that we have here now.So, now that I have gotten that off my substantial and manly chest, please allow me to say that if you like your Westerns VERY old fashioned and not at all messed with or modernized or stylized in any way, then you should give this a pass. BUT... IF you do indeed enjoy your Westerns with a tasteful, stylish, and creative touch that are classy, extremely well put together with all the classic Western motifs firmly in place and executed with TOP quality actors, then you will DEFINITELY have a blast watching this movie. Just check out the comments of people who DO like the film; they REALLY love it!",The Quick and the Dead

I really enjoyed watching this movie, my whole reason of watching it was 1. DiCaprio was in it and hes one of my favourites of all time and 2. A lady gunslinger coming into the town taking up a man's traits in this time had to be interesting.I wont go into the story at all as I dont want to ruin any of this fabulous movie. I really would like to recommend this incredible watch to everyone and even if you're not a western fan, I dont think you'll even notice when watching this, an hour had gone by in no time it should of been 3 hour at least.Great story, great cast...

86,LivingDog,"Spaghetti Western, American Style",8,19 January 2003,"The movie is a mix of typical Hollywood Western (heroes vs bad guys) and Spaghetti Western (artsy/dramatic shots). As such it is similar to the spaghetti westerns but lacking Clint Eastwood and all the action.The story is about a supposed gun-fighters contest for prize money. But in my opinion it is more about the ideals of (so-called) ""good"" vs evil. The ""good"" is the preacher (Crowe) and the ""Lady"" (Stone) vs the evil (Hackman, et. al.).The town is beset by an evil outlaw (Hackman) turned overlord who has even captured a preacher in chains (Crowe) and claimed the power to decide who lives and dies - is Raimi saying this is Satan, and the town is hell? The artsy scenes lend a surrealistic effect to the movie which makes me think ""possibly.""The townspeople are beyond just plain cowards, they have been demoralized and lost all sense of right. Tormenting the preacher as he tries to resist temptation to revert to his old ways and even picking at the clothes of the dead ""contestants.""This is definitely not your standard American Western, so if that's all you want then avoid this movie. However, if your taste is broader than that, then I think you will enjoy this as much as I do (I've seen it 3 times on cable.)Hackman is so brilliant that he has always managed to loose his ""baggage"" from his previous films, thus drawing you anew into his latest flick. I loved watching Hackman control this whole movie - his charcater is pivotal as is his acting.Crowe is good and I enjoyed his performance.Stone only looks the part, but looks the part well.DiCaprio is ""adorable"" as a fast shooter of both his mouth and pistol. In the end he delivers a really good performance.The editting of the gunfights is extremely well down and timed. All the actors appear convincing in their roles as gun slingers simply because of the editting.8/10.ZafoidPS: the word ""good"" is put into quotes since killing another human is in fact evil. The preacher's giving in to his old ways makes the story weak. But this is only a movie, and not a declaration of faith in the Lord.Z",The Quick and the Dead
87,Li_85,My favourite Western Movie..Fun all the way,8,16 June 2006,"The Quick and the dead is my favourite Western Movie. It is just Fun all the way, lots of entertainment. Great violence, with a fairly good plot and a few laughs. I like the idea of a shoot out game of death, deadly but exciting. Among the competitors are Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russel Crowe, Learnado Di Caprio and many more known actors. They all have their reasons of participating. Sharon looks sexy as usual and gives a fine performance as the main lead of the film. Russel is the scruffy hero in a fairly good performance, and the fastest gun swinger of them all. Gene Hackman is great as the violent villain and feared man of the town. Learnado delivers all the laughs and does a good job of it. The supporting cast were efficient, especially Lance Henrikson as the man that claims to be the Best, not before Hackman blanks him. This is a Great Fun movie to watch.",The Quick and the Dead
88,TheMarwood,Raimi's western,6,20 November 2014,"Sam Raimi's first director for hire job is a hell of a lot of fun, even if the film doesn't always work. Raimi directs with boundless energy, with his trademark berserk cinematography, but the film never quite finds its footing. What starts off as a goofy homage or send up of westerns, constantly shifts tones, being broad and silly one minute, then taking its story and violence serious the next. The stunningly beautiful Sharon Stone rides into this small town with an aire of mystery and a vendetta against the corrupt king of the town played by Gene Hackman. Her character and performance work best when she rarely says a word and projects the ability to kick the crap out of any man and the performance and the film suffers when it makes the mistake of trying to add a human element into this thin archetypal character - watching her emote feels forced and phony, as the film seems designed for simple visceral thrills. Hackman seems to relish playing a horrible human and the notoriously difficult actor wisely never hams it up. Raimi has expressed dissatisfaction with the film and while it's not the most ambitious project, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.",The Quick and the Dead
89,flingebunt,Great concept western,7,25 May 2005,"Before you decide you will like to watch this movie or not, you have to understand what a concept western is. There was the Wild West of reality, there was the myth, and then there are certain ideologies and concepts with the Western Mythology.Rather than worry about creating a real situation this movie focuses on the central concept, the gun fight. Each gun fight says something about different aspects of Western mythology.There is the person who creates a legend of himself and can't live up to it. Russel Crowe plays the reformed criminal, now a priest. Sharon Stone is the person seeking vengeance. Then there is Leonardo Di Caprio, looking like an innocent boy as usual. He is the person who tries his best to live up to the ideal of the west.It is exciting as an action movie, but also says other things if you want to look at them.For myself, I have always loved westerns that are high on concept and The Quick on the Dead is mostly concept. With Sharon Stone picking many of the actors and the director for this movie we see her understanding and appreciation of great actors. Especially Russel Crowe who was a complete unknown at the time in America. I hope she becomes a Hollywood producer one day soon.Free your mind and you will enjoy this. One of the few movies that happily combine action and metaphor while ignoring the story. It tends to annoy those who love action or art because neither side can accept both.However it still remains a fun movie, so watch it as a B-movie choose and you will feel OK.",The Quick and the Dead
90,daniewhite-1,Rapid and Decent,5,1 March 2020,"Director Raimi overwhelms his own film with a rapid highlights reel of spaghetti western references and a gender inversion of Clint Eastwood's western persona: a woman with no name played by the adequately sullen Sharon Stone.If you are happy to accept a Hodge podge of things that you have already seen in earlier films given a twist and a tweak by Raimi whilst at the same time suffering from a less than comfortable cast of actors failing to animate themselves then this film contains plenty of fun times. It really does.The strength of the cast on paper belies their collective failure of endeavour in this particular feature but they are all rightfully well regarded from other work. It just doesn't carry over here.'The Quick and the Dead' provides the advertised episodic gunplay and bravado but this plot ploy isn't quite as successful as it could have been in forming a necessary dramatic thrust for the narrative.There were not many westerns made from this period and the mini boom in mid budget and small budget examples of the genre in the early 21st century also seems to be playing itself out a bit as of 2020, therefore I'd recommend that anyone appreciative of this genre check out a relative rarity.I rate a solid 5/10 for a film that fails overall as a production but contains a lot of 90's pep and smarm to gleefully prod at better and more famous antecedents!",The Quick and the Dead

It is not a classic Western great like a John Wayne movie nor a serous drama shoot'em up Western great like a Clint Eastwood movie. Stone beats up and kills men so the lib women will like that. I guess the 'R' comes from the one quick shot/glimpse of Stone's right breast, which they have to shoot with her bending over so the old mammary doesn't sag too much... Hackman plays the evil tyrant of a small town that everyone else in the movie wants to see him dead. He plays his part well.

93,heisenberg12,"Underrated, original, fun entertainment",8,7 July 2015,"If you're not a fan of westerns, you might like this one. If you are a fan of westerns, you'll probably like this one. I felt compelled to write a review of a film like this as I was curious to see its' IMDb rating since I learned a lot of critics picked on it, and I always find it very entertaining whenever I watch it. I also just watched Django Unchained and that reminded me of this in some ways.Any time you get Gene Hackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, Gary Sinise, and several other lesser known but very good familiar faces in a cast, it is always going to be worth the watch as far as entertainment. That alone makes this a good film, but what makes it even better is they are all really giving their all and deliver good performances in this.This is before Crowe became as popular as he did and it's intriguing to see him in one of his first roles. Still, watching this when it came out, I remember thinking that this actor was good even though I never heard of him. Gene Hackman is awesome in this. He really carries the movie. I'm a huge Gene Hackman fan, and if you are too, you'll see he's all in on top of his game here.I thought Sharon Stone was good in this, and the whole plot I found satisfyingly original in that it centered around her character. Most westerns are the usual, but this put a female in the lead role and that was new and different in a good way. Some people criticize her acting/character from what I've read in some reviews, but it didn't bother me at all. I thought she was bad-a-- when she came back at the end.I was too busy having fun watching the shootouts. I found this whole ""setup"" incredibly fun, original, and entertaining. Most westerns are good guys versus bad guys or outlaws versus bad guys, but this is based on a tournament with all of these colorful characters with crazy names and identities. It's just really entertaining and fun to watch.The one thing about this movie is that it's one of those that is supposed to be so serious that it makes you laugh. You have to have a sense of humor for it to enjoy. It's a sick sense of humor thing. For example, Gene Hackman's character is crazy, but it's funny at the same time. There are some aspects (one in particular) that are unrealistic, but they're pretty funny in a similar way.I would mention I liked DiCaprio in this and thought it was one of his best roles. He really played the cocky kid to perfection and the whole thing with him and Hackman's character was good and showed how cruel Hackman was. It's crazy. This is just pure fun entertainment, and it's very underrated. I just saw Django Unchained and I like the Q & D better as far as westerns go. It didn't have as much depth and substance of Django, but that's what makes it great. It is a bang, bang, shoot em up action western with over the top performances.",The Quick and the Dead

95,refinedsugar,... and they said westerns were dead.,7,14 March 2001,"Take a typical western motif and mix it with a huge cast of recognizable faces and you have this genre throwback. Including Sharon Stone doing her take on 'the lady with no name'. With a dark past, she comes into a town gone straight to hell that's run by a nasty outlaw played by Hackman who usurps his power over the townsfolk that equally hate and fear him. It's here where these characters meet for the town's last man standing duel. Where the prize is to die for and of course many will before it's all over. I really gotta talk about the cast compliment. It's the meal ticket. Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman I've already mentioned, but also Russell Crowe and Leonard Dicaprio (both before stardom), Lance Henriksen, Pat Hingle, Gary Sinise, Keith David and a bunch of other bit players you'll probably recognize too. Stone's got her role down pat. Gene Hackman does justice to his mean embittered role almost relishing it. Russell Crowe shows a glimmer of what's to come from him although his character isn't that deep. Lance Henriksen as the slick gunfighter Ace Hanlon is a treat while Dicaprio is given a pretty straight laced role while not restricting doesn't allow him much place to go.I don't think its unfair to say the story is rather predictable, but it's still worth tuning in for. For no other reason - let's be honest - the gun battles. The showdowns. Yes characters and a story go along way, but you want to see people get kablamed too. On that angle this movie performs nicely with fine camera work and direction by Sam Raimi of all people. Using a large town clock with a big 'ol wooden pair of hands that creak when they move was a masterful touch.It's first and foremost action that wins out, but contains enough goings on in the thinking department to be satisfactory. With subplots ranging from hidden agendas, broken pasts and character morality. Some are there to win the trunk load of money, others are there cause they've got nothing to lose. Some are there to prove themselves. May it be to others or to themselves.

And they play a selection of gunslingers from all walks of life: the contemptible, the rogue, the mysterious - all well-drawn, well-written, and well-acted.There's an emphasis on fun over realism (noticeable in its violence) which some may find jarring given the serious treatment to plot and character, but it works. The cinematography is stylish throughout, making the gunfights slick and the landscapes inviting, while Alan Silvestri's score fits the genre nicely.Overall, 'The Quick and the Dead' is a finely assembled piece of work, with confident direction, solid camera work, and impressive cast adding up to an enjoyable experience.8/10",The Quick and the Dead

Almost seems like a parody at times, but everyone seemed to be having a good time making it.Gene Hackman is superb as a brutal town boss. In some ways, this role was related to his ""Little Bill"" character in ""Unforgiven"". Someone with a strangle-hold on power in the town, and murderous in his methods to keep it. He seems to relish the role, and that pretty much makes the movie work.Sharon Stone is occasionally hilarious as a gorgeous, blond, female gunslinger, whose eyes get a workout checking everybody and everything out.

This movie is pure entertainment and I even enjoy Leonardo DeCaprio prancing around and showing off for his (spoiler alert) estranged father in Mr.Herod, self appointed king of the local 'ville'. Fun, funny, and with healthy doses of action. Lance Henricksen is one of my favorites as a cocky gunslinger that enjoys doing aerobics off the back of his horse.

Watching this picture wasn't simply awful, it was painful. It wasn't an exciting western, it was horse excrement. First, a dumb blonde as the fastest gun in the west is stretching the limits of my imagination to the limit, and beyond. Sharon Stone in chaps just doesn't pass muster. Wasn't Tory Spelling available? The ""plot,"" if you'd care to call it one, goes sharply downhill from there, dressing up top Hollywood talent at Western Costume like comedy buffoons, mindlessly shooting one another down like clowns at the Barnum and Bailey Circus.

This time, it's a woman out to avenge the death of her father at the hands of a ruthless gang, headed by Gene Hackman.Flash forward some 30 years or so, and Lady, as Sharon Stone's character is called, has returned to her home town, now living in fear of Hackman's crew, with Hackman now installed as the town's sheriff.Enter a one of a kind elimination tourney to find the fastest gunslinger. Quickly written out is Lance Henrikson's Ace, a quick shooter who eagerly claims other men's exploits as his own. Thinking that Ace is the hired gun that the town has hired to take him out. Instead of being afraid, Hackman's Harrod because even more ruthless, vowing to raise taxes, and even making threats to kill the entire population of the town.The late Roberts Blossom, the veteran actor, is the only one in town who really knows the identiy of Lady, and the reason she has returned to town.Leonardo DiCapio's character is one of the most complicated in the story, next to Crowe's Born again gunslinger. Harrod's son, he is the exact opposite of his ruthless evil father. While much the playboy, Kid is generally a likable character set to prove himself against his father, no matter what the cost.The climax is perfect for the setting, and it really shows what someone will goto, the lengths they will go to to get revenge in the name of family.Now this does contain some rather bloodless, but never the less graphic death scenes in any western in recent memory.

Sam Raimi shows off his craft very well here...and the actors get to really have fun playing archetypes...or maybe spoofs or archetypes.  Sharon Stone doesn't have to do anything but look cool (and sexy when she's under all those furs).  Gene Hackman is virtually the same character he played in UNFORGIVEN, but more one-dimensional...on purpose.  DiCaprio is a hoot (try to remember him before you saw TITANIC and he got overexposed...he was really a fun actor).  An unknown Russell Crowe is moody and handsome, and one gets just a tiny glimpse of the full-fledged ""quiet, tortured hero"" he would become with GLADIATOR.  Lance Henrickson is funny, and all the other characters are totally over the top.  The plot is so simple and straightforward, yet the movie is a lot of fun.  Don't see this movie as an example of a great western...see it if you want to enjoy some great actors having fun with a bit of good-looking fluff.

Plus Russell Crowe gives a capable early performance in a two dimensional role.The Bad: Gene Hackman is still stuck in Big Whiskey playing Little Bill Daggett. The story, an antithesis of Unforgiven's thoughtful study of the consequences of gunplay and the blowhard 'legends' born of it, doesn't amount to much more than a circle jerk for pro gun enthusiasts. I guess in the wake of Unforgiven it was inevitable Hollywood would restore the bullcrap mythology of the the old west and make guns and killing cool again. But the narrative here is weak and the presentation exceptionally cartoonish, and the less than subtle derivations from High Noon to Sergio Leone transcend homage, landing squarely in uninspired rip-off territory. The flashback revelation especially is so derivative of Once Upon a Time in the West you expect the camera to pull back from Stone's and Hackman's eyes to reveal Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson squaring off. It's all only fitting somehow though seeing how Once Upon a Time in the West was itself a rip-off of a dozen or so Hollywood westerns of the 40's and 50's.The Ugly: Sharon Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio make this film nearly unwatchable. If either can act there is no evidence of it here. Stone is pathetic in her tight leather pants and over-the-top duster, trying too hard to ape Clint Eastwood's cool while she swaggers about and snarls some appallingly dull one-liners. DiCaprio is the most annoying and unbelievable element of the piece though, his babyish voice and overdone cockiness just have you cheering for him to bite the dust long before he actually does. This guy is one terrible actor and I'm unanimous in that.Barely worth a look for its good points, this flick is mostly junk.",The Quick and the Dead

It has this kind of a unique concept and feel but at the same time a bit ""Hollywoody"". But in a good mix.

One can actually take the film as a time vessel since it features early, prestardom roles by Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. There's a lot to like about the film. Like its title characters, it moves along at a quick tempo never letting its momentum lag. The quick draws are exciting and Raimi instills many of his trademark camera moves into the proceedings. A shot at a rival gunslinger through an open cavity in a man's chest is pure Raimi all the way. Sharon Stone turns in a fine performance in a somewhat underwritten role as a gunslinger with a grudge to play out.

Its got a lot of cool over the top gun play and the best of the best duke it out in a winner take all scenario (the losers go home in a 6x3 pine box).  Sharon Stone is a good-looking heroine.  I think the character was a little flat and predictable.  Gene Hackman does a nice job as the bad guy running ""his"" town, as he's the fastest gun around.  You see Russell Crowe in a kind of odd role versus what you see him in today; still a somewhat serious character but just not what you would expect in my opinion.  Leonardo is just being Leo - not a lot of depth to his character - and I do wonder how much of a stretch it is for him to play someone young, cocky, and confident. Keith David and Lance Henriksen round out a good supporting cast.Basically, if you're into high-noon time gun fights, or just have a thing for the old western style revolvers the movies worth a watch on DVD or cable (its on every now and then), but there's not rush and if you miss it you won't be hearing about it from all your friends.  At the same time, they won't look at you like you've got four heads if you go out and watch it. So, enjoy!",The Quick and the Dead
108,Soysoy,worth seeing for the 15 first minutes and the general idea,6,29 July 2003,"As most Raimi's movies, this one has for main characteristics: it's fun, it's visually exciting, it has a very good start, and it's finally disappointing.There is a lot of visual invention in ""Quick and the Dead"", even considering previous works with the Evil Dead trilogy. Some shots are stunning.The first five minutes, I was very amused at the way the Western stereotypes were perversely played with, with an even more perverse casting. Sharon Stone trying to play Clint Eastwood is real fun.Sadly, as the movie goes on, it becomes pretty obvious that behind the glossy and clever parody, ""QatD"" is actually an attempt to produce a blockbuster, as it turns into a more pedestrian, average storytelling, and eventually comes to a rather uninteresting development. Collision between two visions: the filmmaker's one, who has a vision and wants to have fun by putting it on screen, and the producer's one, who wants the cash (because that's the way he has fun I guess...).Add to this that the editing is rather inconsistent in places (such a shame as some other parts shows brilliant editing), plus the sloppy post-sync for Crowe's voice, and finally what do you get? Another Raimi movie: partly brilliant, partly awkward, partly independant, partly commercial, and finally as a whole, none of these.What a shame. Raimi, with his visual invention and his crazy ideas, is IMO able to create a really great movie sometime. I'm waiting for it since the time I almost died of laughing when seeing ""Evil Dead 2"". But as time goes on, I'm starting to wonder if I'll live long enough to see one. ""A simple plan"" was a very nice premise, yet I'm sure it's NOT the best this guy could do. Or maybe I'm wrong, and he'll simply forever keep on making half-genious half-crap flicks like this one or ""Spider-man""... Time will tell.",The Quick and the Dead
109,MovieGuyFunTime,Is This a Movie or Psychedellic Nightmare?,5,8 February 2021,"The preposterous premise that a town in the west exists for the sake of willing inhabitants gunning each other down for sport because there is nothing else to do is bad enough, after all, sooner or later you run out of people (and it's already a tiny town). But that's not all! We have crazy-cam and style shots galore! It makes the film less like an old time western and more like a trip through the Looking Glass. And it doesn't work. It is too distracting and jarring... but maybe that was the purpose so you wouldn't focus to closely on the stupidity that IS pretty much the whole film.Sharon Stone does her best female Clint Eastwood (drifter/man-with-no-name) impression and hot of the success of the Best Picture, Unforgiven, Gene Hackman reprises his role as a sadistic one-saloon lawless town boss. There's even a former gunfighter turned preacher (Russel Crow) who is forced to pick up a gun again because of the impossible situation in which he finds himself (gee, where have we seen that before?) Anyone here for the cliche buffet?Through the whole film... or at least as much as I could get through... I kept asking myself ""Why?"" over and over because nothing made sense and it is a giant mess of tough one-liners, non-logic and egos on mescaline.Entirely TOO self-aware and self-absorbed, this film is at first interesting enough, but it quickly starts to run thin and tiresome as the flashy film work becomes too overbearing and fails to distract us from the fact that the story isn't going anywhere and is becoming more and more preposterous by the minute. I mean, how does Sharon Stone's character not get the man-treatment in such a savage, woman-less town?The director would do well for himself to study and emulate the real master of western cinema, Sergio Leone. His film work is intoxicating and mesmerizing without being over-the-top and cartoonish like this irredeemable mess. It might have actually been a more-watchable film if not for the goofy filming techniques.",The Quick and the Dead
110,alexkolokotronis,Advertised As Different Comes Out Dreadful,4,30 January 2009,"Now after a title like that why would I give it even an average rating? The plot was pretty horrible and everything but original. The dialog was pretty corny at times and even the set looked a bit stupid. Still the performances were interesting to watch.Anytime u get see Gene Hackman act like a real mother****** its fun to watch. Hes famous for that and is always enjoyable to watch. Seeing Dicaprio and Crowe in one of their earliest films was the most fun to watch. These are arguably the actors of the decade and seeing them perform at such a young age is very absorbing. Who I found annoying was Sharon Stone. The idea of her role was stupid, the way it was performed was ridiculous and its just not a role to be taken seriously.As I was watching the movie I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie this was or even attempting to be. At times it seemed like a drama or an action flick. At other times it seemed like a parody and sometimes it even looked like it was heading towards the direction of a romance. The bottom line is that this film is confused within itself. In film different either means great or downright horrible and this was lucky enough to not reach the state of being considered horrible.",The Quick and the Dead
111,CaressofSteel75,Standard Western with a Feminist Update,7,14 February 2017,"It's a standard western shoot-em-up done up with a modern feminist twist. Gun fighters, desperados and lowlifes from all over the West head to the town of Redemption for a gunfight competition put on by the town's evil and corrupt leader, Herod, played to the hilt by Gene Hackman.This movie is worth it just for Hackman's presence. He puts on an over the top performance as John Herod who proudly controls the very lives of the townspeople, and he's the deadliest shot of all- a man a lot of people would like to kill, especially Sharon Stone who comes to Redemption to settle an old score. Along the way she meets Russell Crowe, a real deal killer himself who's since reformed into a preacher.Sam Raimi gave this movie his usual great visual style, so you won't even notice most of the time that you're watching what's really an old movie, replete with every stock western character you ever saw.Some have said that The Quick and the Dead is really style over substance, and that's probably true. But if you're a fan of classic westerns, you'll like the fast pace & familiar characters.The only problem with this movie is the final resolution between Lady (Sharon Stone) and Herod. It's not too much of a secret in a movie like this that she finally puts a slug into the bad guy's chest at the end. They set her up as the mysterious gun fighter with an unknown motivation (although the audience gets told what it is), and Herod is the impossibly fast natural born killer that nobody can beat. Their confrontation is inevitable. However, the writers don't give you much to tell you that Lady has any chance in a gunfight against Herod. He should have blown her head right off. They should have set her up as a lightning fast natural with power handed down from her lawman father or foreshadow some type of secret edge over Herod. But we never really get that, so we have to assume she got him with just a lucky good-triumphs-over-evil bullet. If you can overlook that defect, you'll enjoy The Quick and the Dead.",The Quick and the Dead

115,tenten76,"Great film, very entertaining.",9,2 April 2003,"Personally, I think the IMDB rating is way too low.  This movie shines with the golden touch of Sam Raimi; in the almost comic-book visuals, an under-current of comedy, and in the clean, direct (and not overly complicated) story.Paring the Western back to one of its key elements - the mano y mano duel - he's created an exciting tale which doesn't get bogged down in period detail.  The main characters are all larger-than-life (you could imagine a video-game spin-off), and it's easy to guess the ending right from the start - but it's such a fun ride getting there.We get to see a precociously-talented Leonardo Di Caprio (before Titanic turned a lot of people off) and a great performance by Russell Crowe (ditto with Gladiator).  Hackman is pure genius.  If anything, Sharon Stone is the weakest of the characters, but with the ensemble cast it doesn't cause any problem.I have yet to see a Sam Raimi film I haven't enjoyed, but if he's not to your taste you probably won't get so much out of this.",The Quick and the Dead

119,underfire35,"Spaghetti Pastiche, Served Raimi Style........",5,14 May 2005,"During the early 90's, the western genre saw something of a revival. DANCES WITH WOLVES won best picture in 1990, two years later the prize was claimed by the film UNFORGIVEN. Two versions of the Tombstone legend were produced at about the same time, TOMBSTONE (1993) and Wyatt Earp (1994), which varied greatly in tone and success. The trend was towards a revised, and, for the most part, more honest form of storytelling. UNFORGIVEN, Clint Eastwood's bleak masterpiece, attempted to dispel the stereotypes of the ""old west"" and bring to the screen a gritty and realistic portrait of violent people during hard times. This was not a new idea by any means (see Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH), but it was especially pointed coming from Eastwood who, thirty some odd years earlier, became an icon as the ambiguous central character in Sergio Leone's DOLLARS trilogy. It is the style of Leone's ""spaghetti western"" that Sam Raimi seems to take as inspiration for his 1995 film THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. Raimi, at this point, had developed his own style of film making (THE EVIL DEAD films, DARKMAN) and the resulting integration of Leone's ideals results in some of the most satisfying moments in THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. It is also a film that embraces the western clichés, becoming more of a homage to previous cinematic renderings of the time period, which it relies on heavily. This is evident during the opening credits sequence where we see images of the prototypical western (buried gold, dusty landscapes, a graveyard) which sets the tone. Into the town of Redemption rides The Lady (Sharon Stone), who, drawn by revenge, enters the quick-draw competition that is held by the resident warlord named John Herod (Gene Hackman). The contest (and the prize money attached) draws a colorful array of supporting characters: Ace Hanlon (Lance Henriksen), Scars (Mark Boone Junior), Spotted Horse (Jonothan Gill); a hired gun named Clay Cantrell (Keith David); Dog Kelly (Tobin Bell), who has his own score to settle, and The Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a local with strong ties to the town. Herod has also brought Cort (Russell Crowe), a former member of Herod's gang turned preacher, to the event as an unwilling participant. What follows is a protracted series of gunfights, most timed to the strike of a giant clock which serves as a passing bell for the fallen contestants. Theses scenes represent the more entertaining elements of THE QUICK AND THE DEAD: swirling extreme camera angles, fast wide-angle pullbacks, bullet P.O.V. setups; at one point the camera looks straight through a hole in a character's head. The best and, oddly, the earliest major showdown, which occurs between Herod and Ace Hanlon, is the high point of the film. After the final revelation, and ensuing (illogical) climax, the viewer is, however, left with a slick package but very little content.There are moments of development: Observe the scene where, after his daughter has been raped by one of the duelists (Kevin Conway), the barkeep (Pat Hingle) reaches for the man's gun, hesitates, then goes about his business; or the way Herod's hand shakes before one of the gunfights. But in a word, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD is about style. Raimi's vision for the film is helped considerably by several contributors: The cinematography, by Dante Spinotti, captures the dust, rain and the setting sun perfectly. Spinotti also remains flexible, adding his own mark to many of Raimi's outrageous techniques. Alan Silvestri, taking his cue from Ennio Morricone, fashions a score replete with whip cracks, trumpets and flamenco guitar. His work during the gunfight montage is particularly noteworthy. Pietro Scalia's editing (which must have been laborious considering the amount of cuts) and Patrizia von Brandenstein's production design add another level of depth to the story.Gene Hackman can play a character like Herod in his sleep by now, and the film relies on Hackman's persona to backstop a character with limited screen time. He is one of the few actors that can handle a line like ""...you better scuttle your butt out of town..."" and retain a level of humor and menace. As Cort, Russell Crowe (in a very early American film role) also goes a long way with his conflicted preacher in a short period of time. The weakest link is Sharon Stone. Her character is wildly uneven; tough as nails one second, the next, weeping like a child. In all fairness the writing does not help the situation, placing, as it does, almost all of the film's emotional conflict on Stone's shoulders. It would be a hard part to play for anyone, but her performance is disjointed and she delivers many of her scenes far to straight (gender lines aside, an actor like Hackman would have internalized some of the melodrama). The supporting cast, filled in by many wonderful character actors, end up being nothing more than colorful cardboard targets. On a whole, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD does not live up to its lofty influences, but if the you chose to gloss over the film's weaker points, it is an mildly entertaining production in the mold of the western matinée. 5/10",The Quick and the Dead

But the tongue-in-cheek Nineties spin on Sergio Leone-ish spaghetti Westerns is really well done and is occasionally amusing.  It's not a great movie by any means, but Raimi knows what he's spoofing and does so con brio.  The operatic music, the extreme closeups, the vengeance theme conveyed by overwrought flashbacks, all conspire to achieve the goal of honoring, yet chuckling over, the overblown, fly-blown epics like Duck, You Sucker and Once Upon a Time in the West.

At first I didn't know what to expect (not a western fan in any shape or form), then saw the names and thought - let's give this a try.Every detail has obviously been thought through three times, and due attention has been given to pretty much everything in this film, from just about every aspect of production design to smooth, cool, sometimes flashy direction.The sets are as live as you might want them to be, the costumes imaginative and good looking, OTT thought they are. The skillful use of late afternoon or early morning light while shooting (bordering on kitch, but hey, it looks so much nicer) combined with post production, give this film a lovely warm orangey glow throughout, which remains the first thing that comes to mind when I think of it.Because the dialogue is written so competently, with precisely the right balance of cartoon cheese and semi-seriousness, not much effort is needed in the acting department, so the whole ensemble does really well, including Crowe, but most notably Hackman, as the genuinely terrifying wild west small-town bully-baddie (I have a sneaky feeling that he enjoyed himself tremendously during filming). DiCaprio, too, is very good - his death scene made to look genuinely quite moving, to teary teenage girls as well as older folks. The narrative is derivative (obviously), but logical, sensible and clear, and works perfectly within the confines of the chosen genre.Again, it's all in the details, good measure and the beauty of the whole packaging.

It's not because I have any kind of aversion to the genre, it's just not a genre I gravitate to. Sure, I've liked a few in my time like Maverick or Unforgiven, but they were the exception to the rule. Well, I'm happy to say The Quick and The Dead is another exception. This is not only a fantastic western but it's a fantastic film. This film excels because of two things, Sami Raimi's assured direction and the great ensemble cast.This film is pure Sam Raimi, and he directs the film with gusto. There are some great montages of the gunslingers dying in the tournament. The montages wouldn't be out of place in a Spider-man or Darkman film. And there's one provocative image I want to point out, and that's Keith David's death. It feels like something straight out of E. C. Comics. And from what I understand Raimi had to fight the studio to keep that head shot in. And I'm glad he did, that image is awesome. Another memorable death is Gene Hackman's death, where Raimi employs a nice use of shadow. I thought that moment was pretty dope.The film is not perfect which frustrates me. This film could have been a masterpiece if it was not for the casting of Sharon Stone. Don't get me wrong, she's fine in the role, she's just overshadowed by Hackman who steals all the scenes from her. A great actress like Robin Wright could have been great in this role. But hey that's just my opinion. Aside from Hackman and Stone, this film is inundated with a troupe of great character actors.You have Keith David, Pat Hingle, Lance Henriksen, Gary Sinise, and Mark Boone Junior, to name a few. There's also a few rising stars featured in this film like Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The pair of them give great performances.

133,grahamcarter-1,High Plains Django,7,16 May 2017,"'The Quick and the Dead' was directed by Sam Raimi ('The Evil Dead'), and tells the tale of Ellen (The Lady), who in 1878 rides into the town of 'Redemption,' controlled by the 'ruthless' John Herod. Ellen joins a dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death. The names of the lead villain 'Ellen,''Herod' and the town 'Redemption,' were intentional allusions to the Bible. Herod Antipas (20BC – AD40), Tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea, ordered the death of John The Baptist, and the mocking of Jesus. 'Ellen' in Hebrew literally means 'God has answered me.''Redemption' of the first-born son, is a mitzvah in Judaism whereby a Jewish firstborn son is redeemed from God by use of silver coins.The 'Quick and the Dead' is an English phrase originating in the Christian Bible and popularized by the Apostles' Creed, one of the earliest statements of faith in the Christian Religion. Modern writers use the phrase in the secular context, because of the modern English meaning of the word 'quick,' as in fast or smart rather than 'alive.''Once Upon A Time In The West' was co-storied by Dario Argento, who is a stylistic influence on Raimi, and is referred to in 'The Quick and the Dead' with John Herod facing Ellen in the final gunfight. Her identity is a mystery until the end, when we see a flashback As with 'Frank' in 'Once Upon A Time' Herod yells, ""Who are you?"" with the only response being the Sheriffs badge that Ellen throws at him. A trivial link that connects the films is Woody Strode, who appears in both films.Stylistically it could be argued that the film has the look of a western had Argento had the chance to make one; thematically the film has more in common with such classic westerns as 'Django' (1966) or 'High Plains Drifter' (1973).",The Quick and the Dead

If it wasn't evident on the Spidey pics later on it's obvious here. Let's look at the evidence:Gene Hackman is The bad guy.Sharon Stone is a gun-slinger. The film actually revolves around Sharon's character - a hardened (well, kind of) vigilante bent on revenge. But I say ""a"" because the central characters all are.Laughing yet?Leo de Caprio is a smart-mouthed son-of-a-gun.. well that is basically Leo in all his movies but it is still funny here. I can see Sam's eyes twinkle just in the casting.Russell Crowe.. former gun-slinger turned priest who just can't help himself.The plot is about as believable as the Evil Dead. Invitations are sent out to the four winds to round-up all the gun-slingers for a winner takes all contest which allows for a contained experiment in craziness at least equal to any of Sam's other flicks. No attempt at authenticity. This is not really a western. Don't be fooled.The sequences give Sam away: - man gets shot in the head, the back of his head's blown off. - another man gets shot in the eye and does a back-flip with his head as the pivot point. That same man, incidentally, has a clean bullet hole put through his chest and stands there debating whether to fire back with day-light showing through the hole before he takes the head shot. - one man boasts that bullets can not kill him and does an Evil Dead before expiring.I'll give it to Sam though.

It seems that this is a re-make of another film that was made in 1987 I wonder why. Is it because lately there have been too many horrible stories based on true stories, and this one is so preposterous that it is senseless? Perhaps the previous version was not gory enough? What is particular in this production is the collection of absolutely disgusting characters that makes one think that with all the advances in film making, it is good that they did not add actual of smell to this one.",The Quick and the Dead

Sharon Stone does a fine performance as a ""tough"" gunslinger, who turns out to be not so tough after all.  Supporting performances by Hackman, Crowe and even Leo DiCaprio makes this movie very enjoyable, but it could have been disastrous without the star actors.

Spaghetti westerns were all about modern parallels. They were ""post-modern"". Raimi has gone one better and made a satirical pastiche of every western there ever was. Sharon Stone as the 90's feminist gunslinger was an hysterical joke that seemed to go over everyone's head. All of the performances in the film are highly referential and brilliantly pulled off, especially Gene Hackman. Leonardo DiCaprio sticks out as undisciplined. If the film has a fault it's that it's too smart. It's a testament to miss Stone's legendary I.Q. I guess, as she is one of the producers as well.

Well, a maindifference is with Unforgiven and Quick and the Dead is that whereUnforgiven strives for realism and social drama, Quick is waaayover the top.And the brilliance of Hackman's performance is that in this worldthat couldn't possibly be, with characters that have as much depthas a pizza, he makes it all real and shine.Add to that Sam Raimi's dazzling visuals, his best since Evil DeadII, and you got a GREAT flick, even if it does go on too long.Recommended.",The Quick and the Dead

But it was a good shot.Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Gene Hackman are at the top of their game. I personally believe this is Crowe's best film. Sharon Stone does some classic overacting, staying with the whole ""p*ssed off"" vibe throughout the entire movie. Gary Sinise has a cameo as the barely-reckognizable father of Stone (in flashbacks).Good story, pretty good acting, classic avenging-the-death-of-a-parent-against-the-evil-town-leader plot.

It stars Sharon Stone as Lady, the mysterious woman who rides into town to avenge her father's (Gary Sinise, in flashbacks) death at the hands of the ruthless John Herrod (a perfectly cast Gene Hackman), the man who runs the town and ruins it at the same time. Add into the mix a pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio (Stone reportedly gave a portion of her salary up so he could be in it) and a pre-Oscars-winning Russell Crowe in his breakout American role, as Herrod's son and the outlaw-turned-preacher who is forced to fight to the death in a gunslinger tournament.Lots of people don't understand the movie. Some say ""Oh, man, he got shot and DAYLIGHT IS GOING THROUGH HIS BODY!"" It's a convention Sam Raimi uses. The movie wasn't going for an Oscar. What it was going for was a cool modern Western, and what describes Westerns better than gunslingers, booze, fights at a poker game, and vengeance?Check this movie out one day.

This is by no means a real western film but rather a modern twist on one with a full cast of well-known Hollywood actors.

I honestly did not know what to except from it because I have never seen a Western with Sharon Stone. I believed that it may had been an interesting movie, but I was sorely disappointed. This was also the first time that I saw Russel Crow in a supporting role that I think was his first appearance in a United State's movie production in 1995. To continue, I believe that even the concept for this movie was absurd and idiotic! I had seen many Western shoot outs, but nothing like the ones depicted in this movie. In the end came the ultimate Western cliché as Sharon Stone conquers the best draw in town to avenge the death of her brother by the ruthless gangster whom she came to face off and kill in the ultimate showdown.

Really, Leo's character is the most likable in the film and Sharon Stone gives a solid performance along with an early gem from Russell Crowe. Really, I see some of the criticisms of the actors (Sharon Stone is ""Going through the motions"" bluh blah bluh) and it's like, you've obviously never studied character development. If you'd gone through what her character, Ellen, does, as a small child, you'd be a bit wooden and kind of going through the motions. They didn't exactly have psychologists, Prozac, and the assortment of other goodies people today use to get by in the Old West. All in all, I say spot on, and I love this film. If you've seen the way I rate films, you'll know it takes a lot to squeeze anything over a 5 out of me.

151,The_Eighth_Passenger,Sloppy direction and a terrible lead performance ruin a straightforward Western yarn,5,8 May 2013,"On paper, The Quick and the Dead sounds like just my kinda thing as I am a pretty big fan of both the Western genre and Raimi. He is a stylish director, using kinetic, frantic camera movements to both advance plot and visually please the audience. Unfortunately, here he completely drops the ball and is unable to string together the narrative of what is one of the most basic and re-told stories in American movies.Sharon Stone is the lone gunslinger who wanders into town with an apparent grudge against its' head gangster, Gene Hackman. Hackman chews the scenery like he is back on the set of Superman and is clearly having a blast, Stone on the other hand is so woefully miscast that it is just embarrassing. She never for a moment convinces us that she is anything more than a Hollywood princess playing dress up and when she has to square up to Hackman it is like watching a teenager throw a temper tantrum. Stone doesn't realise the director thinks he is making a comedy, which is something she probably should have cleared up with him as she, in her role as producer, hired him. Russell Crowe is underwhelming as the bad guy turned good and he can't hide that Ozzie accent. Leonardo DiCaprio rounds out the key players and he is fine as the young brash wannabe legend, showing that movie star charisma and handsome smile that would define him for a generation of teenage girls a few years later. He is also responsible for the films only real moment of humanity. Lance Henriksen, Woody Strode and Mark Boone Junior are among the supporting players who fail to make any kind of impact due to the lousy script and direction so flimsy the film seems to lunge from one scene to the next with no sense of purpose or vision.The plot revolves around a shooting competition in which the contestants 'draw' on each other upon the strike of the clock tower bell. This gives Raimi plenty of opportunity to showcase some unusual and potentially exciting visuals but he is unable to inject any tension into the proceedings. Leone can make us feel the tension even when we know the outcome, whereas when watching The Quick and the Dead I found myself with one eye on the clock like one of the characters in the movie.Lastly, I'll mention Alan Silvestri's score, which is routine and dull. That comment could review the whole film.",The Quick and the Dead
152,darrell-garrison,It is to laugh!,7,19 January 2003,"I had to laugh reading some of these other user's comments.  It's obvious that today, just as in 1995, people don't get this movie.  They expect it to be a 'good western', or 'art', or a 'Sam Raimi film'.  They are looking for things that simply aren't there.  It's understandable, since this movie was promoted as a straight-forward western upon its release.  But that's the studio suits' fault; not Sam Raimi's.  I'm sure he would say 'Just enjoy!' This movie is not so-easily pigeonholed as some would have you believe. This movie is an homage to spaghetti westerns.  It's a revenge flick. It's good vs. evil.  It's a live-action cartoon.  There is talent at work here, and it's obvious to me that everyone involved in this movie had fun filming it.  This is a true guilty pleasure.  Did you pay to see 'Charlie's Angels' or 'The Mummy' on the big screen expecting 'Citizen Kane'? Westerns these days don't do as well as they used to in today's MTV generation.  This movie is 'Silverado' meets 'Unforgiven' (an overrated western, certainly not deserving of Best-Picture Oscar status that year) in the Twilight Zone! Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone and Russell Crowe all give enjoyable performances.  I didn't know Stone paid DiCaprio's salary; I learned that on imdb.com just now.  But he and the other supporting actors are just as invaluable here as Batman's archvillains.  They fill out this live-action cartoon perfectly.

The story is unique and it's played well, with the flashbacks which remind me of the current TV show ""Lost."" In fact, this movie has that kind of surreal feel, even though it's kind of corny, and it doesn't take itself ""too"" seriously. The acting is great, the scenery is cool, there's not a lot of bloodshed. I am not sure why the movie industry rated this thing with an ""R"" rating.

Preposterous plot and sluggish development of same (you can't make chicken salad out of chicken feed...), the direction seems mesmerized by Stone's undeniable good looks and Hackman's villainous mugging. Absent a convincing story line the plot resorts to endless shoot 'em-up sequences and a blown-to-smithereens ending that masquerades as a an inferno finale --notwhithstanding the fact that the explosion sequences alternate with shots that show little damage to the town's buildings and no casualties among the predictable melange of denizens. The sound track is absurd, climaxing at the end with Stone's steps along the dirt street resonating as if she were stomping on a granite floor, and the music, to put it kindly, mimics Ennio Morricone's early (and better) efforts.

Thus: we'll add a bit of humour, a few larger-than-life characters, and go for laughs; the kind of embarrassed laughs you make at absurdity.

Hell we don't care, let's give the audience a good show. It's only a movie. This one is doomed for endless repeats on some of the more low-budget TV stations.

Like the Evil Dead trilogy the tongue is certainly in cheek with a cast of many well known actors.Sharon Stone may seem to have a confusing character at times but the gun slinging action always has you on the edge of your seat. A great film that is well shot (excuse the pun).,The Quick and the Dead
175,vanToom,A Woody Strode makes no epic movie,5,15 October 2011,"I think someone tried to write the next ""Once upon a time in the west"" according to some references ""The quick and the dead"" obviously take to the story: A heroine that is driven by her past what comes clear in some flashbacks, a villain that is ruthless and doesn't count on anybodies lives, subplots from the past for different characters, close-ups from gunslingers and so on. But one Woody Strode - he has a short appearance at the beginning making some coffins and is one of the gunfighters in the famous opening scene of ""Once upon a time in the west"" - does not make an epic movie. The plot, the score, the dialog, it is all some kind of exerted and does not make up ""The quick and the dead"" for a movie you will remember or you want to see again. I like the actors, the camera and the setting and ""The quick and the dead"" is quite nice entertainment. If you are not too experienced in western, go and watch ""The quick and the dead"", you may like it. If you have seen Leone, Eastwood and others, there is a good comparison.",The Quick and the Dead
176,greenman_99,"Exaggerated, intense, beautiful, silly",10,6 July 2000,"Like all of Sam Raimi's movies, this flick was a cartoon. That's not an insult- his works with the Coen brothers on movies like The Hudsucker Proxy are some of my favorites, with their insanely ""zoomed-in"" quality. This movie was a spaghetti western, it was ABOUT spaghetti westerns, and it was also a weird, wonderful nightmare where your options are limited, you're a superhero, and your enemy is all-powerful. That's adolescent, silly, and totally compelling.Raimi has always done brilliant visuals; I don't know his history, but I suspect he read a lot of pulp comics as a kid. The early scene where Stone gets up (after playing dead) and you see her shadow putting her hat back on, with the obvious bullet hole in the brim, is sheer visual brilliance.Gene Hackman is, of course, great (MST3K line: ""He's good in everything!""). Sharon Stone has gotten a lot of static for doing what Clint Eastwood built a legend on: bad acting, done intensely. (And in Stone's case in this flick, I think, purposefully.) Leonardo D. is well-cast as a cocky, yet needy, ""bad-a** in his own mind"" type. Russell Crowe (who nobody knew at the time, especially me) is great in his role as a survivor of a 12-step program to help fight a dependence on violence, complete with backsliding moments.Do not look to this movie expecting anything like realism, believability, or moderation. This is pulp fiction, eye candy, nightmare surrealism, wanton entertainment. It's trash culture saluting trash culture, and if you can appreciate that, it's a hell of a great ride.",The Quick and the Dead
177,mintchocolatebear,Just Awful,3,17 February 2007,"This film was atrocious. The only reason ""The Quick and the Dead"" gets a ""3"" instead of a ""1"" is because of its A-list cast. The script and cinematography were D-list at best.Had I not known that the actors were taking their lines seriously, or that it was filmed as a serious western, I would have mistaken it for a comedy. Or worse, a spoof. The camera angles were uninspiring and overused, the music was bawdy and clichéd, and the filming tricks belonged in a western-themed commercial for picante salsa. Leonardo DiCaprio alone had me bursting out laughing at the canned dialogue. When Sharon Stone asks him why he's fighting, the long pause and lack of music (both intended for tension and effect) had me shout ""RESPECT!"" at the television. DiCaprio then says, ""I'm doing it for respect."" I might have been a bit sad at the scenes where characters cried, but I was too busy rolling my eyes at Russell Crowe's frequent drop into his Australian accent. Hackman and Stone seemed to stroll through the film as if they were going through rehearsals. Or it's possible they were trying to save their artistic energy for ""Casino"" (Stone) and ""Crimson Tide"" (Hackman), both of which held my attention far longer than ""Quick"". I smiled at seeing Lance Henriksen, Keith David, and Gary Sinise on my television, but then frowned at the horribly small and nearly unimportant roles each were thrown.The flashbacks to the death of the Marshall reminded me of Harmonica's flashbacks to his brother's death in ""Once Upon a Time in the West""; except that the Lady's memories were neither haunting nor mysterious. Rather, they were more an intrusion into an already dry storyline. Removing them might not have improved the film, but it would have at least reduced the amount of time needed to finish watching it.None of the final 20 minutes were a surprise. Though I won't give the specifics of the ending away, it wouldn't be a stretch to call it a ""happily ever after"". So much for a gripping and taut film. I'd call this movie a ""popcorn flick"", but it's not quirky enough to enjoy as an oddity or cult classic. It's just too boring. Utterly, and completely boring.I'll end my criticism here, as continuing would just lead to pointless griping. But before I go, I will say this: ""The Quick and the Dead"" showed that a title can describe exactly how a film can pass through my conscious. The time spent thinking of this movie was ""Quick"", and my interest in it is now ""Dead"".",The Quick and the Dead

I didn't bother to look more than ten minutes at this film and came away with the thought that it was all a waste of talent.

The fight scenes are great, short but intense at the same time. Sometimes besides you can imagine who's gonna be the winner you can't figure how the fight is going to end. And Raimi proves again to be an excellent director. There are some shots that make you recognize him, and a lot of scenes that will make you say ""Wow!!"" (Don't forget that hole in the head... the first time I saw the movie, I had to rewind to watch it again!).If you like westerns, you will probably like this film. If you don't, you may like it too, like I did.",The Quick and the Dead
180,Plectrum-2,A shot just wide of the target,5,12 February 2002,"TQ&TD sits right at Sam Raimi's balance point, both in technique and tone - the quick cuts, fast zooms, and hoky effects of his Evil Dead/shock schlock era, which are juxtaposed with the quiet watchfulness of films such as A Simple Plan and For Love of the Game.Early 21st century viewers like myself will see a host of familiar faces - not only the top-billed Stone and Hackman, but Aliens stalwart Lance Henriksen (as a caricature here), a post-Grape, pre-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio, and the relatively unknown Russell Crowe.Crowe's only exposure to America had been to those who had searched out the limited release of the Oz cult favorite Romper Stomper.  Executive Producer Stone fought hard for his inclusion as Cort, to no ill effect. 
The twist to this take on the Old West duel genre is that it's a woman seeking justice for old wrongs, and as a result the film is charged with emotional fragility.  The hard man is gripped by uncertainty when challenged late in the game.  The good guys vacillate between wrong and right when put on the spot.Stone is a fairly easy read - in turns vulnerable and glib almost to the point of impetuousness - but proves a squirmy center to the film.  The hinge of her performance is provided by the town doctor, who tells her that she's afraid of living.  Indeed, as hell-bent on killing Herod as she is, she could run away just as easily, and ultimately I wondered why not. 
While I found the last third of the film less than mesmorising (there are novel elements, such as the full explanation behind the revenge motive) you know more or less what to expect, and Raimi doesn't disappoint.  What he doesn't do, beside turn the gender tables, is improve on the formula.",The Quick and the Dead

This was a film about a woman protagonist and hero. Of course men don't like it! I just read another review on IMDb by a GUY who said the plot wasn't original. I've never seen or heard anything similar to a story about a little girl who was given a chance to save her Marshall father, who was about to be lynched by Hackman and his crew, by shooting the rope to free him and instead killed him because she didn't know how to handle a gun!! Could any person imagine the guilt a person would carry around if that happened to them? Leonardo DiCaprio had just finished filming Titanic and Russell Crowe was hardly new to feature films. One of my favorite westerns of his was 3:10 to Yuma, but that's another story.Basically, I'm sorry you guys hate it when testosterone isn't what wins the day in a good western, but real history tells the story of many women gunfighters who were as good or better than any man: Cattle Annie, Calamity Jane and many more.I admire Sharon Stone for a good story told with realism of the period. I happen to be a hobby historian about the old west and in real life, the good guys weren't always men and even when they were, they didn't always win, and those popular history paints as heroes weren't as good as people think they were, such as the Earp's and Doc Holiday.Yes, there are thousands of western movies with plots that are similar but The Quick and the Dead has a plot unlike any other I've ever seen and while I haven't seen all of them, I have seen most.",The Quick and the Dead

It is also, perhaps, the most stylish western ever made! And there are a lot of stylish westerns out there. It was also made with respect and affection towards the genre. It's a fresh take that by all rights should've been more successful than it was and continues to be.Consider that it has a female protagonist. Already the film crosses new ground; suddenly the archetype character of the lone gunman is effectively turned on it's head. Also it's shot in a way that pays homage to westerns of the past, but gives the film a fresh, kinetic energy. Also, despite the number of gunfights, it never gets dull.If you're a fan of spaghetti Westerns, keep an eye out for it; you'll never see a better tribute to Leonne-style westerns than right here.",The Quick and the Dead

But this film clearly presents her fantastic acting ability. There are moments in the film where you can genuinely empathise with her and only few actors can project there emotions on to the audience. Also gene hackman delivers an amazing sinister performance that evoke a hateful response from the audience to his character. The acting between the two of them (I feel) makes the film. There are some very tense scenes between him and Sharon which have the audience thinking 'will she, wont she'. Im very surprised that not many people have heard of this film, having asked many people. The editing is fantastic alongside with the music and cinematography. Although the film sticks to the traditional western/ cowboy story lines and it sticks to the stereotypical western genre camera shot I feel it delivers them in a unique fashion that had me enthralled, even though I do not like cow-boyish films.

That is until Ellen ""The Lady"" (Sharon Stone) rides into town, heart set on revenge on Herod- the reason kept secret from us until the climax - and enters into the annual Quickdraw Contest. In a place where women are women and men are men, this surprises our characters, not least Herod's illegitimate son, Fee ""The Kid"" (Leo Dicaprio). In his ill-fated attempts to woo Ellen (along with every other woman in town), we learn that he also has a deep-seated reason to enter the contest. During the opening of the contest, Cort (Russel Crowe) is brought in, an outlaw turned preacher, who vows never to kill, but is entered into the contest by Herod in an attempt to convert him back to his old ways.The twists and turns of this film keep it interesting and superb performances- particularly from Dicaprio, making it definitely one of his best films, and Crowe, a little well-known star when this film was made. Stone plays a convincing heroine with the power to change things and the direction of the film is good- if slightly over-the-top with some special effects- and keeps you in your seat until the credits roll.

Further, the weapons used, and the way the characters use them, seem more in line with 21st century laser assisted Gloks than actual firearms from the period.

205,shadowblade78,A potentially great movie dragged down by Sharon Stones terrible acting.,5,12 April 2007,"!!!Warning. This comment contains extreme spoilers!!! This movie contains some of the absolute worst acting I've ever seen, and some of the absolute best.On one end of the spectrum, we have Sharon Stone portraying a daddy's girl out for revenge against an outlaw gunman who murdered her father when she was a child. Now, that story, perhaps tweaked a bit, could have been good, but Stone absolutely butchered it with her pathetic attempt at playing the role. She plays a young woman with a bad attitude who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. A typical ""mysterious stranger"" type character. The problem is, the role was played so horribly, it's comparable to a high school play performed by a bad drama club full of pseudo-emo kids trying to sound deep.This role could have worked so well, or at least the basic story of ""good guy vs bad guy,"" but thanks to Stone, not only was the role completely destroyed, but the shockwaves of where her performance crash landed very nearly destroyed the entire movie.Now we come to the middle men. Those in the center of the spectrum.First, we have Russell Crowe. He plays Cort, an ex-outlaw turned preacher. Presumanly, Cort is the best gunman in the movie, though we never see a showdown with a worthy opponent. Not a bad piece of acting, but not particularly good, either. Not much to say.Next, we have Leo cast as Fee ""The Kid."" A big-mouthed youth with a fast gun hand, and an even faster mouth. Again, not particularly great acting, but not bad. Not as good as Crowes, though. I feel this role would have benefited more from another actor.Then we have a bunch of other people that don't matter a whole lot.This brings us to the opposite end of the spectrum, as far as possible from Sharon Stones crap-job. Gene Hackman is cast as John Herod. An ex-outlaw that used to ride with Cort (Russell Crowe). Herod is now the mayor of a small town where his word is absolute. The townspeople live in fear, because Herod is pure evil. Gene Hackman doesn't ""play"" the role. He IS the role. This is possibly the best piece of acting I've ever seen in my entire life, and the only thing keeping this movie from sinking into the sludge pit that Sharon Stone set forth. Herod hosts a gunslinger tournament with a cash prize. He is the central pillar tieing together the other 3 main characters.Ellen (Stone) is out to get her revenge on Herod for what he did when she was a kid. She enters the tournament, and ultimately ends up somehow winning, killing Herod in a final showdown at the end.Cort is Herods ex-partner, and has been captured and dragged against his will to the town to take part in the tournament. His fight with Herod is interrupted before it begins, but Herod had one of his toadies beat him up and smash his gun hand before the fight because he knew Cort was too fast for him.Fee is Herods son, who enters to try and win his fathers respect and approval, only to be fatally wounded in the tournament by Herod. He cries and squirms around like a little worm before he dies.These four form the foundation of the movie, but Hackman outclasses them by light years.All in all, this is a decent western dragged down by Stones bad acting, and saved by Hackmans. If you want a deep plot that will suck you in and have you biting your nails, seek elsewhere. If you want a shoot em up and don't care about historical accuracy (which you should be watching documentaries for anyway), go for it.At least, that's my take on the whole thing.",The Quick and the Dead

209,pamtc,Allstar cast struggles with lame script and uninspired directing,3,26 November 2005,"Wow what a cast! But even these superb actors failed to breath life into the characters of this weak script. Everything about this film is sadly predictable, which is in part due to the repetitious nature of the plot. The main theme is a quick draw tournament featuring shootouts in the street at the top of the hour. Unfourtunately, there are no surprises. The director's efforts to generate dramatic tension fail entirely. As you would expect, all of the main characters are still there until the final showdown. On the positive side, there is some clever camera work, and I was pleasantly surprised by Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of the cocky illegitimate son of Herod, trying to earn the respect his father would never give him.",The Quick and the Dead
210,colin_farrell,Fast!,10,9 June 2000,"SPOILER ALERT O.k, so I'm a bit biased as I'm a Russell Crowe (Cort) fan. But, when I first saw this film I didn't like him and I still enjoyed it! I like the way family and lovers are played against each other, and there's a good balance between action and romance (which i usually find painfully boring in films). I also find the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio gets killed an added bonus (sorry to all his fans looking at this film just because of him)! Overall it's great.",The Quick and the Dead
211,BobBish,It's a spoof,10,20 October 2006,"This movie was intended to spoof the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s. I worked on this movie, and that was the stated intent at the time. This seems to get past many people. Critics and reviewers, at the time the movie came out, seemed to miss it entirely. They took it as a serious movie and, as such, panned it.Please see my web site at:http://www.TheQuickAndTheDead.netfor a behind-the-scenes look at the making of The Quick and the Dead.Also, to answer the question in another review, Bruce Campbell did make a cameo appearance in the film, but that scene was cut. His name is in the credits as ""Wedding Shemp"", but the Wedding Scene was omitted.",The Quick and the Dead
212,jbc348,This contains everything I love about movies(spoilers),10,1 January 2007,"The setting is perfect, in which you are allowed to draw in subjects. Thus while you are not necessarily fulfilling the ideal, created by the subsequent fields resulting in the area where the possibility exists that the ideal maintaining thus far is without merit in as far as possible egrets exist out there.The lines of battle are drawn extremely quickly; via the use of familiar actors being used as potential opponents. Thus allowing the moment to captivate the audience. The frustration gathered from waiting, has allowed the actors to establish a general non DOE plumb.",The Quick and the Dead
213,jethro-1,Gene Hackman plays the most despicable SOB ever!!!!,9,3 December 2001,What really makes this movie is Gene Hackman's performance.   He plays the most despicable SOB ever in a film.  He was such an SOB you'd want to kill him yourself.   His performance was even better than his performance in Unforgiven.   He deserved an academy award for it.  I can't remember the last time I ever hated a character so much!,The Quick and the Dead
214,car54way,Sharon Stone sparkles!?,9,6 March 2006,"I am not a big Sharon Stone fan but she sure was very believable part in this great Western nice touch using a woman instead a of a man for the ""avenging angel""could have done without Leonardo DI Caprio(just wasn't believable he seem too corny?!) perhaps Johnny Depp or Henry Thomas would have been a better choice?Gene Hackmans part was typical he has done like westerns uncommon to see Lance Hendricksen in a western (sort of a Wild Bill Hitchcock type) and Russell Crowe as a reformed gunfighter(no accent though) I recommend this movie rent it enjoy it thank you for reading this",The Quick and the Dead

216,stigne,Get past the first 20 minutes and you will enjoy it.,6,24 August 2010,This movie i have seen 3 times so far. I bought it on DVD because i am a huge fan of Gene Hackman and his fantastic ability at acting. I will say that this movie is worth seeing for the cast alone. I found most of it to be reasonable enough to enjoy. It's not as good as Tombstone or Unforgiven but if you like any of these actors then have a look at it. I found the most annoying part to be the first 20 minutes or so. Sharon Stones stupid roll in the early part almost completely ruined the movie.I still have trouble trying to watch this first section of the show. get your self past that and its more fun from then on in. Ithink its worth about 6 out of 10. Gene Hackman again at his finest.,The Quick and the Dead
217,robert-datson,Doesn't quite make it ...,5,12 July 2003,"This film was full of references to other films, notably the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood, and it seemed to lack it's own identity.  An example is the multiple eye shots during the gun battles - reminiscent of 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The plot was completely implausible - where did such a large sum of money come from in such a small town - and how many people are prepared to almost certainly die to win it. The only saving grace was watching the top ranked stars have a little fun with a western. There are too many better examples of westerns for this to get a recommendation to watch...",The Quick and the Dead

219,carney2,An inane piece of crap!,1,7 January 2011,"I'm not sure if this is a ""spoiler."" If so, I apologize, but you have been put on guard.It's bad enough that Hollywood perpetuates the myth of the wild west gunfight with two characters, one in a white hat, the other in a black, meeting at high noon for a quick draw contest to the death. In fact this sort of thing rarely happened. If two men with a ""reputation"" happened into the same town at the same time they generally went out of their way to avoid each other. Now we are to believe that a large sum of money (much of it contributed by a corporation) is offered for a ""single elimination"" gunfight contest. I realize that this is fiction, but c'mon! The dialog is ludicrous, the gunfights ridiculously staged, the ending beyond belief, and the characters are cartoonish cardboard cutouts. A marvelous cast is wasted. With offerings like this it's small wonder that the public no longer flocks to westerns.",The Quick and the Dead
220,mavisre,Any movie that Leo dies in is destined to be a classic,10,20 March 2021,"Every time I watch this, it gets a little bit better. Cheesy the first time, a bit over the top but Gene Hackman is a real a**hole in this film, and Leo gets killed so you have a lot to root for.",The Quick and the Dead
221,feildman1,Waste of time,1,2 March 2014,"Bad movie, waste of video, won't get the time back that I spent watching it. Mistook it for the Quick and the Dead by Sam Elliot(GREAT movie). The only bright light is that DiCaprio isn't doing awful movies like this one anymore.Being a fan of more realistic movies I am glad that other choices exist. In the age of re-writing history and attempting to inject ideals into the past that would have destroyed the past, this movie is a sad example of that.If the ""Old West"" would have indeed been like this movie portrays, we wouldn't have lasted to 1900. This movie should have been built around a different time era. That might have been able to make this movie watchable.",The Quick and the Dead

223,cogenerate,Almost a real good movie,4,19 August 2018,"I wanted very badly to love this movie and it was mostly good. But the main character portrayed by Sharon Stone was simply not believable. And not for any type of sexist reason. I could totally get behind the character itself, it was the acting that continuously broke the immersion for me. While the rest of the actors did a fine job of portraying their characters to the point that I forgot they were actors, multiple times I found myself thinking ""this really isn't Sharon Stone's best performance"". It just felt like she was trying too hard.",The Quick and the Dead
224,kman-norway,Great western with different plot,7,11 January 2007,"Sharon Stone as the toughest cowgirl ever is a great view. But underneath the tough outside she has a painful memory. Gene Hackman is made for the western genre, in this movie he's just as cold as we want him. A young Leonardo DiCaprio may not disturb the ladies either. Russell Crowe also delivers, along with all the other gunmen.The movie delivers great entertainment as we follow a gun contest with a big prize of money. We get to know several characters who wants to win, and it don't take long before we have found out who to support. Guy Ritchie may found inspiration for his character 'Boris the blade' in this movie as we meet a bullet-dodging Indian. A funny one! I think this movie is great because of the superb acting and the different plot with the gun contest. Be ready to be surprised!",The Quick and the Dead
