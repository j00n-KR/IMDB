0,SnoopyStyle,stumbles to the finish line,4,4 April 2018,"Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) with The Right Arm resistance try to rescue Minho from a prison transport train. They manage to steal one car but Minho is inside another car. Minho is taken to the Last City where he is experimented on by WCKD. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) is desperate to find a cure to justify her turn to WCKD and Ava Paige. Thomas refuses to give up on Minho and leads a squad to the Last City.At least, they wrap this franchise up for the fans. This does need a ""previously on"" segment to reintroduce for lesser fans. It's been a couple of years since I saw the second movie and honestly, I don't really remember. The train action is great and the first act is solid. Once they get to the city, I start to lose interest. The plot meanders and rambles. I'm not as invested in Teresa in this sequal as previous ones. This YA franchise stumbles to the finish line but at least, it crosses it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
1,claudio_carvalho,Clichés and CGI,6,15 April 2018,"The end of the franchise ""Maze Runner"" is a film that can be described in two words: clichés and GGI. Too long, with 2h21 min running time, ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" entertains the viewer that enjoys action CGI films and does not think along the story. In this regard, the film is watchable. But if the viewer thinks about most of the scenes, he or she will certainly see the stupidities and clichés of the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Maze Runner: A Cura Mortal"" (""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"")",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
2,nogodnomasters,Follow Me,5,3 April 2018,"Three years since the last film, it would have been nice if they had some kind of flashback to jog our memories. I forgot why they even had a maze to begin with . Oh yea, that antibody thing. Makes for a weak plot. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and a bunch of teens save the world with the help of AR-15s, also my weapon of choice for any zombie apocalypse. If they didn't save the world, it wouldn't be much of a film. Kaya Scodelario was less than convincing, perhaps because she resembles Kristen Stewart so much. A lot of action, faux drama, and mediocre dialogue. Plot Spoiler...OMG They killed Kenny er ah Gally! Of course after 3 years I couldn't remember who was alive or dead. The whole rescue happens because the needs of the one out weighed the needs of the many or few. It was a film I felt I had seen before. It did have some decent action scenes. I felt disconnected from the characters after all of this time. Guide: No F-word, sex, or nudity.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
3,kosmasp,Final run(through),6,12 April 2018,"So the trilogy comes to an end. And it is quite decent, even if it has its flaws. But at least they kept the whole thing quite short. Reoccuring characters and events continue to unfold. So it does make sense to have seen the other movies. Not sure how it is compared to the novels. Probably will not look as good for those who have read the source material.The action and the effects are good. There may be some logical errors that you can decide to overlook or not. But it's overall a fun ride, especially if you have formed some kind of bond with the characters.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
4,jboothmillard,Maze Runner: The Death Cure,6,4 February 2018,"The first Maze Runner was a really good film, the sequel, The Scorch Trials, was good, so I was really interested to see how the third and final instalment would go, I was hoping for a conclusion worth waiting for. Basically Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Newt (Love Actually's Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and Frypan (Dexter Darden) are the last of the free ""Gladers"", who survived the Maze and are immune to the Flare virus that has eradicated most of the world. The three leave their camp, against the orders of The Right Arm resistance leader Vince (Barry Pepper), to rescue their friend Minho (Ki Hong Lee), who was captured by the WCKD organisation to be tortured in the hope of finding a cure for the virus. They head for the ""Last City"", where the WCKD headquarters is located, they are saved from an attack by ""Cranks"", humans infected by the virus, by Jorge (Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar), who join them. Meanwhile, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), who betrayed the group, thinking that what she was doing was right, has joined WCKD leader Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) in the efforts to find the cure, but she is clearly devastated by the torturous methods used. The group reach the Last City, which is surrounded and protected by a large wall, outside people are rallying to be let in, WCKD opens fire at the protestors, while the group are captured by a group wearing men who take them to their hideout. One of the masked men is revealed to be Gally (Son of Rambow's Will Poulter), who survived being speared by Minho, he takes them to see rebellion leader Lawrence (Walton Goggins), whose face is disfigured as a result of the virus. Lawrence grants them permission to enter the Last City through the secret entrance, in the underground sewage passages, Gally leads Thomas and Newt through the city, they see Teresa, Gally knows that she can get them into WCKD headquarters, the three capture her and she agrees to help them, removing their trackers. Thomas, Newt, and Gally escort Teresa inside WCKD headquarters, they find the immune children, Gally looks after them and stays to find a serum that can treat the Flare, while the other three try to find Minho. They are caught and chased by the vengeful Janson (Game of Thrones' Aidan Gillen), leading the WCKD troops, Teresa lets them escape to search for Minho, before rushing to the laboratory with a bandage containing Thomas's blood to test it. Gally takes the serum and takes the immune children to a bus where Brenda is waiting, Gally makes his way back into WCKD, and the bus attempts to escape the troops closing in Thomas and Newt find Minho in the medical wing, they are chased by Janson before escaping, Teresa discovers that Thomas' blood can cure the Flare, she and Ava agree that they must find him. While Frypan saves Brenda and the children in the bus, Lawrence rallies the rebels outside the city before blowing a hole in the city wall, his allies and infected people storm the city. Gally finds Thomas, Newt and Minho outside WCKD headquarters, Newt collapses having succumb to the virus, he gives Thomas a necklace with silver cylinder pendant before passing out. Teresa transmits her voice throughout the city, telling Thomas that his blood can save people if he will only return to WCKD, Newt regains consciousness, but is now a Crank and attacks him, he begs Thomas to kill him while doing so, with no other option, Thomas kills Newt. Thomas makes his way back to WCKD and confronts Ava, she stresses that the intentions of the organisation are good, but she is killed by Janson, who is turning into a Crank. Janson knocks Thomas out and drags him to the lab, where Teresa is ready to extract his blood. But Janson reveals that he and WCKD are only truly interested in curing those whom they please, Teresa turns on him and a fight ensues, it ends when Janson is killed. Thomas and Teresa escape to the rooftop, Jorge and Vince are piloting an aircraft above to rescue them, Thomas makes it aboard, but the rebel attacks cause the building collapse, Teresa falls to her death. The group reunite with the rest of the Immunes and the Right Arm, escaping to a safe haven that Ava revealed, there the remaining population can live safely. In the end, Thomas finds that the pendant contains a note written by Newt, he is still traumatised by the death of Teresa, he reads the note, it tells him to look after himself and everyone else, before thanking him for being a friend, it ends with Thomas writing Teresa's name on a memorial rock for all those who people remember. Also starring Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel as Harriet, Katherine McNamara as Sonya. O'Brien is still reasonable as the brave leader, Clarkson lightens up, but Gillen remains a nasty villain, and the support of Scodelario, Brodie-Sangster, Esposito, Pepper and others is still well done. The similarities of The Hunger Games remain, plus the zombie outbreak plot, the political stuff is still present, and there are many high-octane chase and explosive sequences, the conclusion is perhaps a little open-ended, but its reasonable, all in all it is a worthwhile science-fiction dystopian action thriller. Good!",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
5,view_and_review,Died of Boredom,5,12 February 2018,"As far as teenage dystopian trilogies go, it was alright.The Death Cure wraps up what started in 2014 and was first sequeled in 2015. Now, it's 2018. Do you think I remember what happened in parts one and two? I would if they were interesting enough but unlike a Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars, or Hunger Games even--this series was not nearly captivating enough for me to remember the characters and plot points. I think I watched Death Cure just to finish what I started. I don't want to be known as a quitter.They attempted to make this movie a little more dire, serious, and portentous. Yes, it was all that but I wasn't feeling it. The world is dying, hopelessness is abundant but to me it seemed old hat. I've been here before via sooooo many other movies--other better movies at that. Maze Runner may have been accomplished as a book but there was no magic as a movie.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
6,neil-476,At least it finishes things off,7,1 May 2018,"In the wastelands and ruins of wrecked cities, there are 3 factions - a group of (mostly) young people who are (mostly) immune to the plague which has decimated the human race, Cranks (murderous cannabilistic zombie types who have contracted the plague) and WCKD, a group who remain privileged and protected while experimenting on young people with a view to producing a cure. A group of experiment victims have joined other survivors and are, effectively, at war with WCKD. A key factor is Thomas, once within WCKD until his memories were removed and he was placed with other experiemental subjects in the Maze.Based on a series of Young Adult science fiction novels, the Death Cure brings the trilogy to a close. I have read and enjoyed and more or less forgotten the novels, and that is something of a problem. The first 2 films came a year apart. There was then a 3 year gap before this one appeared, and I have forgotten who everyone was and the details - some of which are important - of the story so far.The film doesn't offer you any catch-up, so watching the other two beforehand is a prerequisite.It is packed with action from start to finish: just as well, because there is not a whole lot of character stuff here other than issues of betrayal and trustworthiness. There are deaths of characters you wished wouldn't die as well as an unexpected re-emergence of a previously dead character. I'd say it was a surprise, except thank you trailer.Juvenile lead Dylan O'Brien remains as anonymous as he was in the previous two, the grown-ups and even the other youthful thesps leaving more of a mark. The always deliciously horrible Aidan Gillan is as deliciously horrible as ever.The visuals, especially the cityscapes, are excellent and the film is moderately entertaining if you know what's going on. A qualified success, then.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
7,trashgang,all action but maybe too long,7,31 May 2020,"A lot of negativity surrounding the third entry into the Maze Runner franchise. So I waited 2 years until the whole fuss was over. It even almost ended the craeer of Dylan.Was it all that bad, not for me, a very good start with the train. And from there on it's all action. Maybe some are right, it could have been shorter the movie, because clocking in way over 2 hours is maybe too long.Effects are good and naturally some love has to fit into the story, hey, it's a teen flick, remember.It's not a movie you will remember, it's above mediocre and that's a good thing.

8,deloudelouvain,Don't need to make another one,6,23 May 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure isn't the best movie in this series, that's for sure, but it's still watchable unlike some other sequels from other movies. That the first ones were better is one point, you had the surprise element, that is all gone now. I think they made this movie to score a bit money from the success the others had. They can call it quits now and leave it like that. The movie is too long and it's all a bit predictable, but like I said it's watchable. Watchable if you're not too picky and have a bit of patience. There is some good CGI's and action scenes, the story is a bit weak though. The acting is exactly what you expect it to be with movies and characters like that, all a bit exagerated and not award winning. All in all it's an okay closure for this series of movies.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
9,siderite,A weak an predictable ending to a saga that no one cared about anymore,5,13 May 2018,"Yes, it's a young adult story. Yes, it's got all the shortcomings of lazy writing. Yes, it's all incredible beautiful teens fighting the evil uncaring adults who envy them their youth. And with all that, Maze Runner had something in the first movie that made me want to watch it. Some sort of story, maybe the acting, maybe the whole thing. I just enjoyed it. So I watched the second movie to see what happens and then this piece of crap from pure inertia. And it was just not worth it. Imagine two hours and twenty minutes that could have been compressed into a five minute How It Should Have Ended animation (which would have been better). Kids are good, WICKED is bad (duh!), bullets kind of care about that because they fly away from the good guys and things just happen to be where you need them to be for them to escape and not kill anyone, not even the bad guys, because they are the good guys. A lot of talk, a lot of talk, then some talk, followed by more talk. The last part of the movie has all the action sequences and they are all Michael Bayish. Bottom line: I don't think they even tried to make it a good movie. It was all algorithmic. Why end a series that at least started interesting with a twist, or some nice action, or anything resembling a story? No. Take any other YA movie and copy paste it over these characters. It's like creativity costs money for these people. It's like it hurts them, like the sun kills bugs. It was so boring that it wasn't even funny.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
10,Hellmant,"Surprisingly intense, and very dark and bleak!",8,2 February 2018,"'MAZE RUNNER: THE DEATH CURE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the dystopian sci-fi trilogy, which is based on the popular YA book series by James Dashner. In this finale, Thomas must lead his friends through one final deadly maze, in order to break into the last city. It was directed by Wes Ball (like the previous two films), and it was written by T.S. Nowlin (who also wrote, or co-wrote, the previous two chapters). The movie stars Dylan O'Brien (in the lead once again), Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Rosa Salazar, Ki Hong Lee, Will Poulter, Aidan Gillen, Giancarlo Esposito, Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson and Walton Goggins. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well (although it hasn't done as well as the previous two installments). I enjoyed it. Thomas (O'Brien), Newt (Brodie-Sangster) and Frypan (Darden) are the last of the 'Gladers' (and those who are immune to the virus). They're desperately trying to save their friend, Minho (Lee), who's also immune and being held captive by the WCKD (in order to test his blood for virus cures). The trio makes their way to the Last City, with the help of other rebel survivors Brenda (Salazar) and Jorge (Esposito). Once there they team-up with an army of infected rebels, as well as another friend that they thought was dead.The movie is surprisingly intense, and very dark and bleak. The action scenes are really well done, compared to your average YA book adaption, and I think it's a quality made sci-fi dystopian genre flick. I think you have to be a fan of the series though, to keep up with all of the characters and their drama. I didn't remember what was going on with all of them, from the previous films (and I didn't read the books either). I was still pretty entertained by the movie though. It's a bit long, but it is action-packed and always exciting. I look forward to seeing what this director does next.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
11,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 July 2019,"Fun and pretty epic action flick. entertaining for one viewing. some great action scenes and good music. some of the emotion hits, some doesn't. some great acting, some good acting, some bad acting. some dumb stuff but mostly things you can let slide. overall enjoyable experience (1 viewing)",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
12,ThomasDrufke,A Fitting Finale,6,31 January 2018,"I'm glad that the filmmakers still found a way to release The Death Cure and not go straight to digital/on demand. It's not that I think this trilogy is among the best post apocalyptic series nor did I really have an ounce of excitement going in, but after Dylan O'Brien had his accident and over 2 years of fans waiting, the ending is here.If I'm being completely honest, The Death Cure actually served as a perfectly fitting end to an above average young adult series. I don't consider myself a fan per say, but if I was, I'm guessing I would absolutely love this film. It ties up loose ends and finds a way to close out the series in a surprisingly emotional send-off. It's much different than say The Hunger Games, which ended the series on a completely sour and disappointingly safe note, The Death Cure takes some chances and didn't have the beat for beat moments I expected from a YA adaptation. O'Brien, who is shaping himself out to be a force in this business, provided another solid lead performance and he's surrounded by equally efficient turns from Kaya Scodelario, Aidan Gillen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosa Salazar. None of them take the material too seriously, something the Divergent series had a problem with, but they found a right balance of heart and humor.It's far from perfect, and for those who don't appreciate a good YA adaptation every once in awhile likely won't find anything here to like, but The Death Cure was immensely better than I expected. Sometimes that's all you need a film to be.6.9/10",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
13,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,It was a disappointment,6,27 August 2021,The first movie was very good and different. I wasn't expecting such a sequel. I haven't read the book. It was a disappointment.,Maze Runner - The Death Cure
14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,16 April 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death CureAdults always chase after teenagers in dystopian futures because they need to know which social media to use.However, the grownups in this sci-fi flick have bigger concerns than cyber stalking.As the Flare virus continues to convert the remaining human population into zombies, scientists continue abducting uninfected youths to find a cure. Fearful that their friend is going to be dissected, maze survivors Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) disobey the resistance leader (Barry Pepper) and head to the Last City.But they cannot penetrate the citadel without help from some unlikely allies (Walton Goggins, Kaya Scodelario).While the initial installment of this post-apocalyptic franchise was intriguing, this third chapter in the adaptation of the YA book series is the complete opposite. Predictable and inert, this last kick at the dystopian can feels contrive.Incidentally, one side effect of injecting yourself with teenage blood is much more angst.

15,The-Sarkologist,Too Long Between Drinks,4,26 January 2018,"Well, it seems as if there was been a lot of anticipation with the release of this film, or at least the youth media has been drumming it up a fair bit. Then again, with the demise of the Divergent series, I had pretty much given up on the final film of this series, but then again I had completely forgot about it until the ads for this last one hit the screens. I guess that had a lot to do with me really not liking the Hunger Games, and becoming progressively more and more bored with Divergent, that I really didn't particularly care about this one.
 However, then it appeared in the cinemas, and that is where the main problem lies - I had pretty much forgotten what had happened, at least in the second movie. Okay, I do vaguely remember them being chased everywhere by zombies, or at least zombie like creatures, but that is about it, so here we are, in the third movie populated by characters that I really had no clue as to who they actually where. Honestly, I'm not even going to bother with a recap.
 Like the previous series that I have mentioned, this is one of those Dystopian post-apocalyptic films where the major characters are young adults fighting against a world that is being manipulated by the older generation. The world has also been struck with a disease that turns people into these mindless zombie-like creatures. In a way it is a little like 28 Days Later but much further in the future. Then again, I preferred 28 Days Later than this one, but that probably had a lot to do with the zombie being in the background rather than front and centre. Anyway, as the title of the film suggests, it is basically about attempting to find a cure for this disease, but it is also partly about how the main characters are attempting to rescue their friends from the claws of WCKD.
 Honestly, I didn't find this film all that great. Maybe it has something to do with me being a little to old too be able to relate to the characters. Maybe it has something to do with having seen this plot time and time again, or maybe it is that I have simply seen much better versions of the same theme. Okay, I have to admit that it was better than some of the other Dystopian Post-Apocalyptic films that I have seen, and a part of me does want to watch it again from the beginning, since I won't end up being as lost as I was while watching this film. Then again, it also has the guy that played Littlefinger in it, and he certainly pulls off a decent bad guy.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
16,Thanos_Alfie,Decent ending...,6,14 November 2018,"""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" is the last movie of the Maze Runner trilogy which starts where the second had finished, Thomas once more leads the same group with which he escaped Gladers on their new and even more dangerous mission than the previous one. In order to succeed in saving their friends, they have to enter the legendary last city which is controlled by WCKD. A new labyrinth is ahead of them and anyone who makes it out alive will get the answers to the questions about the maze and the whole world.I have to admit that I expected for this movie to be even worse than the second but I was happily surprised that it was not. Since I had low expectations for it I would like to say that it was a nice movie to watch and I enjoyed it. It has an interesting plot with some plot twists that I did not expect and an average written script. The direction which was made by Wes Ball was average and not the worst as many reviewers mentioned. I liked the interpretation of Ki Hong Lee who played as Minho and I believe that he was the best, I also liked the interpretation of Thomas Brodie-Sangster who played as Newt. Regarding the interpretations of Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) and Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) I have to say that I expected more.Finally, I believe that ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" is an interesting movie and you aren't going to waste your time watching it. It's not the best movie of this trilogy and of course, it cannot be compared with the first movie but I recommend it to anyone who already started this trilogy.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
17,eddie_baggins,"A fine, if unremarkable series end",6,10 July 2018,"Out of the series of high profile teenage dystopian books adapted for the big screen (Divergent, Hunger Games, The Giver are other such titles) over recent years, Wes Ball's Maze Runner series has remained a constantly solid and often impressive adaptation of James Dashner's story, even if the trilogy petered out slightly box office wise with the late arrival of last year's The Death Cure.Facing lengthy release delays due to it's star Dylan O'Brien's serious on-set injuries suffered during a stunt in Death Cure's production, Ball's film felt like it hit an eternity after the 2nd instalment Scorch Trials was unleashed on our cinema screen's in 2015, yet despite a long time between dystopian drinks, Death Cure offers fans of the film's a fitting, if overly long farewell that makes a solid argument for Ball's trilogy to be considered the best of the teenage dystopian bunch.For a film that's budget is relatively low for such a high-end feature, Death Cure makes the most of the tools at its disposal to become a film that's at its most thrilling and engaging when the action kicks in and from the impressive opening train chase, through to some fiery end carnage, Ball displays an impressive handling of the big-scale to give Death Cure some gravitas and spectacle that's of a high-order, even if the character beats and engagement that was found early in the first film's mysterious setting is largely lost here on its journey to tie up proceedings.Fortunate enough to keep its core cast attached for the duration of the 3 - 4 year process, most performers here could now perform their respective roles in their sleep and Death Cure struggles to do much with its large collection of goodies and baddies with O'Brien's Thomas in particular becoming a fairly bland hero as he looks to stop WCKD from kidnapping anymore of his immune friends as the Flare virus rages on around them.Character actors such as Barry Pepper, Patricia Clarkson, Aiden Gillen, a make-up clad Walton Goggins (looking like a character directly out of a Fallout game) and Giancarlo Esposito all pop up to various degrees of success, but really this is the film led and anchored by the youngsters.The biggest issue with Ball's final entry is the aforementioned runtime, at nearly 2 and a half hours, Death Cure does overstay its welcome and feels like it would've benefited greatly from a tighter edit with all things considered.Final Say - It never reached grand heights, but with The Death Cure ringing in the end to the Maze Runner series we can now safely say this trilogy provided enough thrills and excitement to justify its existence and be regarded as the top cat of its dystopian classmates.3 Walton ""Ghoul"" Goggins out of 5",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
18,filipemanuelneto,"A good continuation, even if it has many flaws.",6,29 January 2021,"After two films, the trilogy is complete with this film, even though I have a feeling that there would be a willingness, on the part of the production, to make a fourth film. In any case, it was with pleasure that I decided to see this film. I still like it, but it was the film with the most flaws and weaknesses in the trilogy (or tetralogy?).In this film, Thomas is still disappointed with Teresa and tries to overcome that. But the desire to save Minho and take revenge on WICKED is evident and leads him to take a dangerous path, which will lead him to the mouth of the wolf, to the headquarters of the organization that, in the name of good and medicine, seems to have totally lost the notion of ethics. It is a film that fits well with its predecessors and gives the trilogy a positive conclusion, if they decide to stop it here. In fact, I noticed the film does not seem to know if it is a continuation or the conclusion of a franchise. I still don't like zombies, I've never been a fan of zombies. The film has good scenes of action and suspense, the ending is really well done but, after a certain moment, drag on and lose the rhythm. I also noticed some flaws in logic and continuity, like the fact that Ava says the virus is aero-transmissible, and it just won't be said or developed later. And, for God's sake, how did so many healthy human people suddenly appear?The cast is generally good. Dylan O'Brian is safe in his character, but there's not much more for him to show us that he hasn't shown before. Scodelario continues to shine and make an interesting character, more complex than he appears to be. Aidan Gillen was a sinister and inhuman villain. Thomas Brodie-Sangster receives additional attention and does his job in an excellent way. Ki Hong Lee disappears for much of the film, although his character is decisive in the plot. Giancarlo Esposito seems to be determined to win a Cavalry medal, because he always shows up to save his colleagues at the right moment. Rosa Salazar practically disappears from the moment the screenwriter decided that her character was not going to fit Thomas.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI. The desert and inhospitable world seems great, and the city of WICKED is futuristic, elegant and of remarkable visual beauty. Infected human creatures, as I said, are the least positive thing and, in this film, they almost disappear from the scene. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. The soundtrack also deserves mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
19,leonblackwood,Watchable movie but not an all time classic!,6,6 June 2018,"Review:
Although I wasn't a big fan of the first 2 movies in this franchise, I actually didn't think that this film was too bad. It's full of intensity from the beginning to the end, and the action scenes were pretty impressive but the acting was awful, especially from the lead character Thomas (Dylan O'Brien). I was also not impressed with the predictable storyline but the whole ""race against time"" element made it a watchable film, especially as it was the last movie in the trilogy. Anyway, this movie see's an older Thomas, fighting against the WCKD to try and rescue his close friend, Minho (Ki Hong Lee), with his fellow Gladers. After failing the first mission, he still manages to rescue other Immunes from a train but Thomas is still determined to go back for Minho, who is being tortured in the ""Last City"" by the WCKD, who are looking for a cure for the deadly virus. During the night, Thomas decides to leave the camp, against the orders of Vince (Barry Pepper), who is the leader of the Right Arm, and he makes his way to the ""Last City"" to try and save Minho. 2 of his close friends, Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and Frypan (Dexter Darden) decide to follow Thomas on his rescue mission but they get attacked by Cranks, who are humans infected with the Flare. They soon realise that they are ambushed, and with no ammunition they have no way to turn, until they are saved by 2 other Gladers, Jorge (Giancario Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar), who also join them on there mission. When they finally get to the wall of the Last City, which protects the city from the Cranks, they come across a group of protesters who are fighting to get let into the city, so they use them to try and get inside. The WCKD start to fire at the protesters, so the Gladers have to run for cover, with many of the protesters losing there life's. They are then captured by a group of hooded men, who are led by Gally (Will Poulter), who is also fighting against the WCKD. He then takes the Gladers to his leader, Lawrence (Walton Goggins), who helps them enter the Last City through a secret entrance. Gally then tells Thomas that he can get them into the WCKD headquarters with the help of Teresa (Kaye Scodelario), who is a former Glader but is now helping the WCKD to produce a cure, using the Immune for experiments. They then kidnap Teresa, who gives them ways to get through the security in the Last City but they have to battle against the ruthless Jason (Aidan Gillen), and his henchmen to get to Minho. When Lawrence realises that the Last City's security system has been compromised, he forms an attack against the WCKD, which makes it difficult for the Gladers to plan an escape. Will the Gladers make it out on time, before the whole of the Last City is destroyed! I know that it sounds a bit confusing but believe me, it is pretty straight forward, especially if you have watched the previous movies. To be honest, I couldn't remember who was who from the previous movies but I still found it easy to follow. Aidan Gillen played the villain well but the Gladers really needed a stand-alone hero, who actually had some skills. I didn't have high expectations for this film, especially when I saw that the whole cast was returning from the previous movies but the action scenes really saved the day. I think I have to watch all 3 movies together to actually get a true feel for the Maze Runner franchise. You can watch this film without watching the other 2 movies but I personally think that I would have enjoyed it more if I knew who was who, and what was what. Anyway, this film is worth a watch for it's action and CGI but from a storyline and acting point of view, it could have been much better. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Wes Ball, who also brought you the Maze Runner and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. As the Maze Runner franchise was his first projects for the big screen, I can honestly say that he achieved a lot, especially as all 3 movies made a profit at the box office but I can't help thinking that it could have been much better if an experienced director and an experienced actor took the lead. With that aside, it certainly went out with a bang, with the number of explosions and battle scenes throughout but I still can't see it going down as an all-time classic. Budget: $62million

20,Tweetienator,Only Any Good If You Are Stoned Pretty,3,28 May 2018,"The 1st movie of the triology got a 7 from me, the 2nd a 5 and the last one gets a straight 3. 
Whereas the 1st movie was no masterpiece but good with an interesting concept and a good shot of suspense and mystery, the 2nd one could not hold the level, but still was okay/solid. 
But this last one is really annoying - action scenes for the sake of action (and badly and plain boring executed) and to fill playtime, and a plot so predictable and boring, well, I never read the original books, but lets say, all the conclusions of the story are so boring and predicable like Ridley's revelation of the Aliens origin is. Better to reveal nothing if you have no idea how to reveal something original. Last note: maybe some scientists could make a survey to examine a possible correlation between the legalization of dope in some states to the downfall of quality in such a many movie productions/scripts. 
Imo writers should quit using drugs or should not write anything (not every writer is a Hunter S. Thompson or sth of that caliber). The simple truth is: everything looks good if you are stoned. But for the not stoned audience such ""fantastic, ueber-creative"" ideas aren't most times. But maybe one day, we, the audience, get some drugs with the tickets, so we can enjoy that s**t too. But in that case who would need a movie anyway!?",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
21,TheMovieDiorama,Maze Runner: The Death Cure is a fittingly epic closing chapter that might just be my personal favourite of the series.,7,24 February 2018,"Another YA franchise completed (let us rejoice...), although 'The Maze Runner' series has actually been pretty decent from the start. A slight misfire with 'The Scorch Trials' but Wes Ball is back on track to get the job done in style. Thomas and the gang want to save his remaining friends from the Maze who are now being stored and tested on in the WCKD tower. They must infiltrate the walled city before the virus destroys all of humanity. I'm going against the critics on this one. Yes, it's overlong. Sure, it pretty much consists of an expositional script. Of course, certain plot points seemed unbelievable and convoluted. But do you know what? This is exactly what I wanted it to be. Epic. What a finale this was! It starts off with what looks like an action set piece from the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, then we go through an apocalyptic tunnel straight out of 'I Am Legend' to a futuristic city scape that resembled 'Blade Runner'. It borrows all these elements to create a satisfyingly entertaining flick. The visual grandeur has never looked so good, the series has come along way in terms of detailing the architecture and modernisation of this dystopian future. The first act starts off well, the second is a bit of a slog...but then the third act arrives. Oh yes! Moody, gritty and some surprising plot twists that made it even more enthralling. Flashing lights and piercing alarms whilst our characters shoot their way out of the WCKD building as a burning inferno rages on in the streets below. The ferocity was conveyed excellently, and the stakes were raised. All the cast members did a good job, particularly O'Brien and Brodie-Sangster's onscreen chemistry. Whilst all the action is taking place, there are moments of sadness. And yet again, I felt the feels. Maybe I'm getting emotionally vulnerable as I get older? Honestly though, I was expecting to hate this, yet I came out loving the series even more. My favourite chapter to date.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

Though it's still got some fun up its sleeves (the directing style and action stuff are especially great), the story and characters are awfully rote, making for an ending that just sort of putters out.

The characters are serviceably likable, the villains feel villainous, the action scenes still have that awe factor to them. And it wraps up perfectly fine.I simply don't feel like it was the right move for this franchise to leave the maze. Everything after that has felt generic and clichéd. The maze was something new and exciting. It was a mystery to be solved. Had there been another maze after they broke out of the first one at the end of the first film, for example, that would have been even more exciting. How many layers of mazes are there? Who has built these and why?Now we got answers to those questions in the second film and they weren't very exciting at all. And now we're reaching resolutions to conflicts started in the second film and it's still pretty... meh.I mean, there's nothing outright wrong with these films.

A pretty good action film, it really pulls no punches. The kind of Mad Max like setting also works too, even though I liked the last two films of this series. Everybody gives a good performance except for Dylan O' Brien, not that he was terrible, some scenes he was good, but others he was kind of bland while trying to be strong, instead looking uninterested.

26,stevendbeard,Pretty Entertaining,7,27 January 2018,"I saw ""Maze Runner:The Death Cure"", starring Dylan O'Brien-Teen Wolf_tv, American Assassin; Ki Hong Lee-Wish Upon, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt_tv; Kaya Scodelario-Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales, Clash of the Titans_2010 and Aidan Gillen-Game of Thrones_tv, The Dark Knight Rises.
This is the third in the series, the first one was in 2014 and the second one was in 2015. FYI: This one was supposed to come out in 2016 but Dylan was injured on set, while filming, so it got postponed. This one takes up after the last one ended, with Dylan and comrades trying to rescue a captured Ki Hong from the evil corporation, WCKD-if you say all 4 letters as a single word, you get wicked. Kaya, Dylan's ex is working for WCKD to find a cure for the disease that is turning everyone into Cranks-it's what they call zombie like creatures. Certain people are immune to the disease, such as Dylan & Ki Hong, and WCKD is trying to find a cure, using their blood. The only problem is, they are draining them dry with little results. Aidan is still the enforcement arm of WCKD and all he wants to do is get his hands on Dylan, alive or dead, he doesn't care which. WCKD has set up quarters in a forgotten city, which I guess is the maze in this movie. Be prepared, not everyone makes it out alive. In fact, one person that was thought killed in the previous movie, makes a startling return. It's a pretty entertaining movie with a satisfactory ending-I don't guess there will be any more in the series.

The final act is far better than the rest of the film and actually gets reasonably exciting, however overall it remains unremarkable.

The ending of this movie is intense, emotional,tragic & epic.The futuristic city looks stunning!!!
The cinematography is beautiful throughout the whole movie.
There's a real sense of danger that hangs over the movie,the characters are always on edge & sense of loss is always there.I love this excellent trilogy,the first film was a clever escape adventure,the 2nd was an apocalyptic-zombie type survival Thriller & this epic 3rd part is a sci-fi action Thriller,but all 3 films are excellent in their own way & that's very rare to have a complete excellent trilogy but they do get better as they go along but i think ""The Scorch Trials"" would be my favourite as i loved the whole ""Mad Max"" style desert wasteland setting & the Awesome Infected-Zombie type Creatures called Cranks.Thomas is nearing the end of his pulse pounding story & he is ready for war,a great character who has gotten better with each film. Also great to have Vince back, played by one of the most underrated actors of all time, Barry Pepper, who gives a good performance as usual & he's one of my personal favourite actors ever!!!Truly a completely satisfying,action-packed,dark sci-fi Thriller that is perfectly directed & acted by everyone on board.

32,kluseba,A spectacular action-thriller to conclude a dynamic dystopian trilogy,8,24 June 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure is the third and last part of the trilogy centered around a group of teenagers immune to a virus that has decimated mankind who are hunted down by an organization that wants to conduct brutal experiments on them. I have read quite a few negative reviews about this film but let me tell you that this movie is very good conclusion to the franchise and if you liked the first two films, you will certainly appreciate this final installment as well.Everything isn't perfect of course. The story is very predictable. Obviously, one could blame the source material here. However, some twists are foreshadowed in a way that anyone will see through them. To give you one concrete example, there is one character who is constantly looking at his arm, rubbing it, sighing, feeling weak and looking around gloomily. When it is revealed that this character is infected by the virus, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone since the foreshadowing was completely overacted.Other than that, the movie is great from start to finish. Some people claim it was overlong but I never felt bored and thought it was entertaining from start to finish. The action sequences are truly intense and make for a worthy Hollywood blockbuster. The special effects are more present than in the first two films but they have the purpose to make for a bombastic finish and especially the final third of the movie is absolutely breathtaking and epic. The acting performances are as solid as in the first two installments and the protagonist has a really strong moral compass as the movie teaches us to never leave your friends behind and always believe in yourself.To keep it short, Maze Runner: The Death Cure might be the most spectacular action-thriller of the year. The special effects and action sequences are extremely strong. The acting performances and the characters are also above average. Only the story is a little bit predictable and simple. If you have the chance to enjoy this vivid film at your local cinema, go for it as it will help you get into this bombastic finale. Another option would be to watch all three parts and see the development of the different characters and the story line. Ignore the overtly negative reviews and enjoy this blockbuster for teenagers and young adults.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
33,adamjohns-42575,"Needs more time spent on it, but a good film to end with.",7,7 November 2021,"What is going on with Gally's eyebrows? They are a huge distraction at times!This is a good third instalment to a good film series, but, even though I haven't read the books, I can tell that there is a slightly rushed element to it and that there is more information to be had. I personally think the best format for stories like these is a TV series, where the authors work can have justice done to it. It needs a true fan of the books to take it on board and do it the credit it deserves in the same way that JJ Abrams obviously loves Star Trek and Star Wars, based on his versions of those.There are no stand out performances and as much as I love him, I'd love to see Aiden Gillen play a different part every once in a while, for me he's still playing Stuart from 'Queer As Folk' with hints of Littlefinger from 'Game Of Thrones'It is a good story and I'm sure that there are lots of teenagers out there that absolutely love it and worship the actors. They are the target audience after all. It's just not outstanding, although it's definitely better than 'Insurgent+'.If the Maze Runner films had been released in the 80's, they would have been all over 'Look In' and 'Smash Hits' magazines.The only big criticism I have is that you can tell how these films are going to end now. Having watched Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Insurgent+, Etc, they are all getting to be a bit predictable. I'd like the authors out there to think about that and for the producers to consider this when finding new projects.706.77/1000.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

Movie Overall: 7.0LIKES:
-Strong Opening
-Acting
-Suspense
-Final SceneDISLIKES:
-No Refersher
-Length
-Serendipity's Intervention
-Reduction of Characters A third installment for a popular book is a challenge Hollywood continues to fight in this modern age. With the Maze Runner, the series has struggled to captivate me the way the books did and thus I had doubts of what the third movie had to offer. Fortunately, the team managed to get a strong opening out into the film, hooking one into the film with the excitement you hope the rest of the movie will have. This tale is only further enhanced by the acting, which continues to grow with each film, and further bring these characters out in the heat of the moment. Watching these characters to develop in this suspenseful tale kept me invested into the story, holding my attention as I anxiously awaited to see who would not survive the ordeals at hand. And after such an exciting climax, the ending concludes the story with the emotional drive and relief you'll need to take you down a few gears, though I would have liked all the answers at the end. 
 Despite all this intensity though, the movie had a few areas of improvement for me. A nice review could have helped get me back up to speed, but this minor dislike is not my main concern. Instead it's the lck of balance this movie had in terms of length and character usage. The movie is over two hours and there were dragged out moment that didn't quite require the extra half an hour to get the full effect. These drawn out chases and heavy banter loaded hold ups just didn't impress me and the serendipity conclusions to these endings were more funny than fulfilling to me. As for the characters, the main cast gets their adequate screen time, but newcomers and key characters are reduced to background moments that were disappointing for me. 
 Overall though, this movie has more positives than benefits and gets extra points for being an entertaining and emotional finale of the trilogy. With the intensity of this movie and all the integration of their key characters, one will find this movie hard not to become engaged in. You just need to have 2.5 hours at your disposable and be willing to except the drawn out moments and reduction of characters you grew to love in the first two movies. This imbalance isn't the worst I have seen, but had this been given another round of editing tricks we could have an even better movie.

35,rannynm,Packed with Action Beginning to End,10,25 January 2018,"This film is full of action from beginning to end. During the production of this film in 2016, Dylan O'Brien was severely injured on set. Because of that, the film was delayed and is just now being released. I'm so sorry about Dylan's accident and believe that the wait was worth it, as I love this movie. This is the third and final installment of the Maze Runner trilogy. Thomas and his friends head to the last standing city to save their friend, Minho and take down the Government Association known as WCKD. I'm quite a fan of the Maze Runner books, so I can vouch for the accuracy of this movie. Quite a bit of the story is different from the book. Even the plot of saving Minho isn't in the book. He is with the group in the book. However, all the major events are still the same as both stories involve taking down WCKD. This movie is fast moving and heart racing. In almost every scene something exciting is happening. The film barely gives you time to rest. I feel like this keeps you on edge and it works. During some scenes I tensed up, with my fists clenched. The action is actually very effectively exciting. There are tons of explosions, and fire and gunshots. And they are all so cool. The special effects are really impressive. This film is a dystopian story. The reason the world ends in this story is an illness known as the ""Flare"" that turns people into zombie-like creatures. The makeup used for the creatures, known as Cranks, is outstanding. Here's a shout out to the entire makeup department. The acting is also really good. Dylan O'Brien, who plays Thomas and Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who plays Newt, have incredible performances. I will not spoil what happens, but one specific performance from them had me in straight up tears. Also, the city where most of the film takes place, known as Last City, has a very neat design. It looks intimidating, yet beautiful. It felt like Los Angeles, but darker. I'm curious if the director, Wes Ball, plans to do the prequels, as there are two prequels.

Other than these two scenes, it was completely predictable. I do want to mention Aiden Gillen is perfectly cast as the pure antagonist in every film I have seen him. The unfortunate thing os he has painted homself into a corner as far as casting goes. He os extremely talented, and I would like to see him cast as a protagonist sometime. Malcolm McDowell (who is extremely talented) began his career thus way, but over time, he has been one of filmdom's greatest actors; he can play anything. The same gies for Willim Dafoe.

38,moviexclusive,"As explosive and rousing a finale as you'd expect from the 'Maze Runner' series, this third and final chapter goes out on a literal and figurative bang",7,25 January 2018,"Next to 'The Hunger Games', 'Maze Runner' is probably the most successful of the numerous dystopian YA adaptations that have come in the wake of that Katniss phenomenon. Part of its success is its willingness to eschew socio-political allegory for straightforward action, and this final chapter is no different. It could dwell on issues of class injustice between those living within the city of gleaming skyscrapers and those living in the shantytowns below; or it could try to make a political statement by linking the massive, heavily fortified walls that surround the city to the current US President's pet project; and to some extent, it does flesh out the ethical conundrum of preserving the lives of an innocent few or sacrificing them for the greater good - but first and foremost, this is a thrilling, at times even rousing, action film charged with adrenaline-pumping and heart-wrenching moments.True to its nature, it begins with a spectacular train rescue indebted to 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. While resistance fighters Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar) distract the train drivers and their back-up air support, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and resistance leader Vince (Barry Pepper) board the train from the back and attempt to de-couple the last five carriages from the rest of the locomotive. As much as they intend to save the young prisoners on board held captive by the evil quasi-governmental agency known as WCKD (pronounced 'wicked'), Dylan's motivation is really his previously apprehended comrade Minho (Lee Ki Hong). Alas the latter is not among those they successfully rescue - turns out he is already at WCKD's imposing headquarters in the middle of the walled-off burg termed 'The Last City', where he is subject to psychological experiments aimed at extracting a serum that would slow down a virus which turns its victims into zombies.Those who recall the previous two chapters will remember that Thomas and his mates had escaped a monster-filled labyrinth known as The Glade, journeyed across a harsh desert wasteland called The Scorch, and had no sooner found reprieve when they were betrayed by one of their own Teresa (Kaya Scodelario). Though she was Thomas's love interest, Teresa was ultimately convinced by WCKD's chief scientist Ava Paige's (Patricia Clarkson) pleadings that these tests on those who have demonstrated immunity to the virus were necessary for the sake of the greater good. Not only has she not changed her mind, Teresa now consciously ignores her inner conscience and participates with Ava in Minho's torture - and although the story gives her the chance to redeem herself at the end, you'll still cheer what eventually befalls her (pun intended, for those who have read the book) as just deserts.Much of the movie revolves around the subsequent daring mission to break Minho out from within The Last City, a protracted expedition that will lead Thomas into the orbit of a gruesomely scarred leader of the infected Lawrence (Walton Goggins) as well as a former Glade frenemy Gally (a delightfully sardonic Will Poulter) earlier presumed dead. What starts off as a low-key operation descends into all-out mayhem as Lawrence himself plans a full-scale revolt which erupts into open warfare even as the WCKD's soldiers, again led by the smarmy Janson (Aidan Gillen), try to re-capture the Immunes and apprehend Thomas and his fellow Gladers. This last hour goes from one action-packed sequence to another without catching a breath, but visual-effects-supervisor-turned-director Wes Ball stages the fireballs, street battles and close-quarter fisticuffs cum shootouts with clarity, confidence and creativity, so that as relentless as it gets, it is consistently exciting than exhausting to watch.Including this one, Ball and his screenwriter T.S. Nowlin have shepherded the entire trilogy from print to screen and their affection for the characters is undoubtable and undimmed. Our personal sentiments for Teresa aside, Ball does a neat job setting up her motivations, complexities and uncertainties, leaving you guessing right till the end which side she will choose. He also handles Newt's arc deftly, and without giving anything away, let's just say book fans will be pleased by how that emotional turn of events is depicted as well as Brodie-Sangster's heartfelt portrayal. Ball deserves credit too for extracting a suitably charismatic performance from O'Brien, which makes Thomas a much more interesting lead than the unequivocal martyr-saint-hero he is in the book. But perhaps the most memorable of the teenage characters here is Gally, thanks to Poulter's perfectly-timed wisecracks, and Ball knows just when to employ him to break up the seriousness of the proceedings with some genuine levity.So as clichéd as it may sound, 'The Death Cure' ends the 'Maze Runner' series on a bang - not just in terms of being a wall-to-wall explosive finale from start to finish but also by giving the characters a proper sendoff. Like we said at the start, this isn't and doesn't aspire to be the sort of intellectual science-fiction that 'The Hunger Games' is, but is in fact all the better for simply being a viscerally exhilarating picture with finely staged action and poignant (male) camaraderie. Unlike the occasionally soporific two-part conclusion of its more acclaimed genre predecessor, this one - to borrow a reference with cheek - indeed does catch fire.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

40,cricket30,In perhaps the most stirring plague-fighting docudrama since . . .,8,2 February 2018,". . . YELLOW JACK, this flick presents a thinly veiled account of the Lone Star State's triumph over Ebola in 2014. (Yellow Jack, of course, is the 1938 MGM vehicle depicting actor Lewis Stone as U.S. Army Maj. Walter Reed, taking on the scourge of yellow fever as America was digging the Panama Canal.) MAZE RUNNER 3: THE DEATH CURE turns the heroic virus fighters of the Dallas County, Texas medical community into a composite character--a research virologist named Teresa (played by Kaya Scodelario). Teresa slaves away like Thomas Edison trying 14,000 different filaments in his quest to invent the incandescent light bulb, as she labors over the blood of dozens of test subjects immune to an Ebola-like malady threatening the human race. Teresa is based in a high rise with distinct Texas architectural highlights (at first I thought I was seeing the one-time Enron headquarters), rising up as the focal point of a metropolis that could easily pass for the Dallas skyline. THE DEATH CURE does a great job of evoking the darkest days of the Great Texas Ebola Scare, when there was palpable panic in the streets amid media predictions of an Armageddon of Biblical proportions. Despite similar distractions, Teresa labors on until she pinpoints a cure for the plague, not unlike her Real Life counterparts did in Dallas. In an ironic twist, Teresa's cure sort of gets lost in the shuffle of THE DEATH CURE's somewhat cluttered ending. Instead of everyone getting the vaccine to quell the outbreak once and for all, a group of folks who are mostly immune already apparently set sail in a derelict freighter, winding up on a placid beach not unlike South Padre Island, Texas, in the off-season. Be that as it may, THE DEATH CURE's Teresa is sure to go down in film history as a portrayal of a Real Life Point of Light, along the lines of the Walter Reed character from YELLOW JACK.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

42,one9eighty,An average end to the trilogy,5,4 February 2019,"If you have been following the previous Maze Runner films, this one finds Thomas on the outside, living with the Rebels, and searching for a cure for the virus known as ""The Flare"". The film features a lot of the faces you've seen in the series so far, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scoderlario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Will Poulter, Rosa Salazar, Patricia Clarkson, Aidan Gillen, et al.Picking up pretty much where the last film, this final instalment in the trilogy is probably the weakest in the series, IMO. Perhaps I've been exposed to too many films but this felt a bit too safe and predictable. Appearance wise it looked authentic enough, the CGI and action didn't look out of place. The delivery of the narrative wasn't awful. The narrative itself however was a bit uninspiring; there was a lot of talk to establish things that had already been established in the first films. The characters motivation didn't seem all that either; sure they were trying to fight the bad guy, but never once did it feel like it was them fighting for the entirety of humanity - there was never any real urgency. For the most part the film followed the book - with the obvious exception, for anyone who's read it, of the final climax in the film. Other 'young people vs the adults' have experienced the same lull in their later movies so it was no surprise that this too troughed at the end of its life cycle too. All in all, an average, yet uninspiring 5 out 10.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
43,bettycjung,"Good ending for the series, but make sure you see the first two.",7,29 January 2018,"1/28/18. This is the 3rd Maze Runner movie that ends the Maze Runner Trilogy. It was a decent finale for the series, with plenty of action and special effects. The story was ok, no spectacular. Because it has been 3 years since the 2nd movie, the interest in this series may have suffered from a lost in momentum and interest. The movie could have used maybe a 10-minute refresher of the prior two movies at the beginning to bring the audience up to speed. That would have made it more interesting to watch.Granted the delay was due to O'Brien's injuries in filming this threequel, I am glad to see he is okay, and he definitely needed to be in this one to bring closure to the story. Worth catching if you have been a Maze Runner fan. Maybe not so much for those who have not seen the previous two movies.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

45,fernandoschiavi,"For a genre that aims to create a discussion, the end of the franchise presents some interesting sequences, but it misses the opportunity to end a cycle",7,21 March 2021,"With the subtitle ""The Death Cure"", the last chapter of the trilogy has a lot of adrenaline, but it pulls the brakes more than in the previous two films to explain why everything that happened before. The motivations end up not making much sense, but the plot ends in a satisfactory and even a little daring by today's standards. This third chapter comes to conclude the franchise with dignity for book fans, but perhaps it will only be on the big screen with history enthusiasts. The film begins exactly where the second, The Scorch Trials, ended. The script does not make much of a point of locating the viewer in the plot and the most overlooked must have difficulty remembering some facts. This is also aggravated by the premiere delayed by more than a year, due to a serious accident that the protagonist Dylan O 'Brien suffered during the recording of the film (the studio was forced to stop filming for about 10 months and postpone the launch for the full recovery of its protagonist).By giving up science fiction - and it is possible to feel it in the first sequence - and embracing action cinema, director Wes Ball makes it clear that he will no longer have an interest in the discussion that the previous films (also directed by him) sought to take on. In the opening minutes, we have a chase of cars, trains and ships that take your breath away with bold and creative camera shots in the middle of the desert and put the actors (and stuntmen) in the middle of the whole operation. Director Wes Ball, who started his career in visual effects supervision, has a special eye for both practical effects and CGI, finding a satisfactory middle ground and bringing the best of both worlds. This sequence goes back to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with touches of Mission Impossible and Resident Evil, the end result is fantastic.Even so, a very high level of suspension of disbelief is needed to accept the lazy solutions that the script gives us. It was not enough for the resolution of a conflict to arise at the exact moment of need (the famous God ex machina), new elements are presented without at least a justification. The plot unfolds in this war between CRUEL and the rebel group and, if the first two thirds of the film flow in an organic way, the conclusion lacks in lengthening the narrative and including a huge number of God ex-machina - the unexpected solutions that appear to save the protagonists. Most of them are caused by the weak villain experienced by Aidan Gillen, who is not convinced by the discourse of choosing between who should and should not receive the cure and borders on the cliché in many parts. The exaggeration of plot twists ends up tiring those who do not know the story through the publications of the author James Dashner.The problem with the production is in its script, which drags the plot too much and leaves the film tiring. The second act is very long, which hinders the progress of the story and leaves the audience tired. The final act, full of frantic action, follows the same path by adding several false endings. It looks like the movie will never end. However, it is necessary to highlight the aesthetics of the film. If the previous film had the desert as its main scenario, in this conclusion of the saga, the action moves to the last city, where the base of the organization CRUEL is located. The design of the city is beautiful, referring to the over-lit urban centers of the cyberpunk universes, and the people who are outside the walls also have a beautiful composition. In the midst of all this, we have buildings and locations decimated by the sun, denoting the contrast with the Last City, bringing that ruined scenery with incredible realism. The color palettes in the photograph are incredible: we have a bluish palette for scenes within the city that refer to 'Blade Runner', and an orange palette for chaotic scenes outside the city that resemble 'Mad Max'. In fact, this film is very reminiscent of the 'Resident Evil' franchise.In addition to being excessive, the script destroys a considerable part of the film's support. Wes Ball's direction, on the other hand, is effective in not transforming the conclusion of the story into a completely abhorrent product. Wes Ball knows how to direct frantic scenes and who knows, especially within indoor settings, how to create interesting visual compositions. In a specific scene, Ball contributes to Gillen's performance, elaborating a situation in which the villain enters the scene through the smoke, creating a sense of maleficence. We have an inconsistency, however, in the tone that Ball gives to some particular, but very important segments. While the director knows how to be as cheesy as possible in dramatic moments, pulling for the manipulative melodrama, he, in contrast, hits on some plans that invoke the despair of the characters, such as when a passed out body is pulled exhaustively on the floor.There is also a certain insistence on keeping the characters poorly resolved until the last act. If on the one hand this brings a principle of discussion, after all, right and wrong are subjective concepts and in a conflict both sides believe that they are fighting for what seems to be the best, the film soon abandons this possibility, making ambiguity just an easy resource for trying to create tension. Thus, the conflict of generation Y (something present in the previous films) gives rise to the rush. People infected and doomed to live like zombies (an analogy that worked very well for the generation of millennials) are also reduced to wallpaper. Their presence only serves to create a false sense of urgency, in addition to an escape scene that is just a badly used cliché.Although there are certain problems in terms of character development, Maze Runner stands out for working well with this gray area. It is not as eight or eighty as most films of the genre. It may even slip at a more villainous moment than necessary - like Ava contemplating the beauty of the wall she built - but it is interesting to note that it does not work with the notion of redemption. People have different and unique worldviews. If Teresa's betrayal in the previous feature had been a big surprise, here the character gains space to show her side.In the cast, Dylan O'Brien who really stands out, with a convincing performance and an evident evolution of character. This time he is more convinced in his decisions, even though he still doesn't seem to understand what his leadership figure means. At the same time, Teresa (Kaya Scodelario, from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge"") remains the most interesting character in the franchise. The character shows the duality of a person who, even understanding the evil he is causing, prefers to sacrifice everything for a greater good. The script is only lost when it prolongs its final redemption. Because it is the end of the franchise, it is difficult to give depth to all the supporting actors that permeate it, but the actress Rosa Salazar, the rebel Brenda, stands out among so many, showing the strength of the character through a solid and coherent interpretation.Lawrence (Walton Goggins, from ""The Hateful Eight"") is a fascinating character with an incoherent conclusion. He appears to assume a role similar to that of Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito, from ""Okja"") in the second film, as the man who is in this situation only for profit. Jorge, however, when he loses his role in the plot, is relocated to another role. Lawrence, in turn, suffers the common consequences of scripts that do not know what to do with characters after fulfilling their roles in the plot, which in this case is to cause the final battle. The ultimate conflict between C.R.U.E.L. and residents outside the city are free, adding nothing to the plot, just reinforcing how much the script preferred to give up science fiction to focus on a grandiose and exaggerated action.This, however, does not mean that there are no good moments in the film. Some of the action scenes are well executed and, even with exaggeration - which becomes a problem when the film tries to take itself seriously -, they create interesting sequences, despite the constant use of camera shake. Between a great chase scene and another, the script delivers some of the answers to the questions asked in the previous films and several plot twists (some very obvious), which end the plot in a very decent way. In addition to the first sequence, we have an incredible jump from a building with the camera following the protagonists, great and tense sequences of invasion of the CRUEL facilities and a final explosive and engaging act.Maze Runner: The Death Cure can even work well with the post-apocalyptic theme within literature, and fans of the literary trilogy will probably have different positions if this has been a faithful adaptation or not, following the desires of a youth-childhood interested in photocopied portrayal of a previously lived experience that cannot be matched in another medium. If it followed the original story loyally, James Dashner's work certainly conveys many negative things to his film adaptation. If not, T. S. Nowlin managed to transform everything Dashner wrote, possibly even a relevant commentary on the society in which we live, into an action film with a generic dystopian-teen story.Perhaps the time for franchises, whether in literature or in cinema, of dystopias that look at the generation of young people who search for identity in a confused and complicated society is approaching the end. ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" chooses to leave aside concepts that were fundamental in its origin and get lost in the basics. For a genre that aims to create a discussion, the end of the franchise may disappoint those who identified with the work from the beginning. What is left is a film with some interesting sequences, but it misses the opportunity to end a cycle.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
46,Anurag-Shetty,Matches up to the first installment in the trilogy.,8,2 February 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure continues with the adventures of Thomas(Dylan O'Brien), Minho(Ki Hong Lee), Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Frypan(Dexter Darden), Brenda(Rosa Salazar), Jorge(Giancarlo Esposito) & the others. Thomas plans to rescue his friends from the clutches of WCKD & also find a cure to the life-threatening 'Flare' virus. Maze Runner: The Death Cure is an awesome movie. Director Wes Ball makes sure that this finale to the Maze Runner series, lives up to the brilliance of The Maze Runner(2014). It makes up for the slightly disappointing, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials(2015). However, the 2014 original is still my personal favorite in the trilogy. The highlight of the film is the action set pieces. My favorites are the train scene & the climax. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is effective, for the most part. Dylan O'Brien is fantastic as Thomas. Ki Hong Lee is brilliant as Minho. Kaya Scodelario is outstanding as Teresa. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is spectacular as Newt. Dexter Darden is good as Frypan. Will Poulter is excellent as Gally. Rosa Salazar is superb as Brenda. Giancarlo Esposito is great as Jorge. Patricia Clarkson is unforgettable as Ava Paige. Aidan Gillen is perfect as Janson. Walton Goggins is mind-blowing as Lawrence. Maze Runner: The Death Cure is a must watch for fans of the Maze Runner franchise.

48,dave-mcclain,"a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, but still not as good as most of the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" films",6,28 January 2018,"""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" (PG-13, 2:22) is the third film (after 2014 and 2015) in the ""Maze Runner"" trilogy, directed by Wes Ball and based on James Daschner's YA novel series of the same name. The long time between the release of the previous film and this one is largely due to star Dylan O'Brien suffering a serious injury on set in 2016, pushing back production almost exactly a year and doing the same to the release date. Before seeing this one, I went back and read summaries of the first two... because 2015 was a while ago... and I found the first two kinda forgettable. But... what about this one?Thomas (O'Brien) is back as the young man leading a group of rebels through a dystopian future in which a corporation called WCKD uses human experimentation to research a possible cure to a world-wide plague which turns people into zombies. Thomas' main goal throughout the movie is to rescue a fellow experimentation victim named Minho (Ki Hong Lee) from WCKD's clutches. If Thomas is to be successful, he'll need the help of his friends (Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Rose Salazar and others) and they'll have to go up against WCKD's leader (Patricia Clarkson), her henchman (Aidan Gillen) and the young doctor (Kaya Scodelario) who was once a friend to Thomas and company.This movie doesn't skimp on the action and the stakes in every scene are high. It's true that you don't have to see the first two to appreciate this one, but it helps... and it makes it more likely that you'll see this for the satisfying conclusion that it is... even if the whole thing still suffers in comparison to the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" films. Still, ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"" isn't half bad. ""B""",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
49,silvermistvio,"It's not bad. As for me, it's such a great film.",10,27 March 2018,"I'm a big fan of Maze Runner series. And I always so anxious to watch it when it's out. I waited very long time for this movie to come out. After I've waited a really really long time, it came out eventually and I watched it so anxiously. Yet, this one can't compare to the previous two films, but it's not a complete junk. At least it is better than Blade Runner 2049 film because it's watchable. As other people say, yes, the story is quite predictable and there's no many adventures. But it still makes a good film. There are four main things I want to say about this film. Firstly, the film is basically great. Not only visual effects and performances are good, but also everything. There are one thing that I don't like that much, but it's still okay. Teresa didn't need to die. When she threw Thomas onto the Jet thing, she could jump before the building collapsed. There was enough time to jump. But they let her die. I guess they just want to show Teresa's love on Thomas. Second, the death of Newt and Thomas's reading Newt's letter are saddest scenes of all. It touched me. So, I even cried. Thirdly, one of my favourite scenes is that the death scene of Jenson. It's kind of a good way to kill him.Lastly, the only thing I don't like is that they didn't explain how Newt got infected. To the end of film, I was still wondering how he was infected. Then I remembered that Dr. Page said that the virus is airborne. So, I guess everybody can get it. If so, I wonder why Dr. Page didn't get it. All in all, it makes a fine film (as for me, it's a great film) even though there isn't many adventures or whatsoever, it's watchable and enjoyable. As for me, it's a great film. I didn't know how time passed.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
50,kjproulx,A Solid Conclusion For Fans,7,29 January 2018,"The Maze Runner films aren't any sort of Hollywood masterpieces by any stretch of the imagination, but I've always thoroughly enjoyed them for what they are. Going into the third film after quite a large break since the second installment, I found myself wondering if it was too little, too late. Happily, I can admit that this trilogy of films stays pretty consistent with one another in the fact that each consecutive film builds on the previous one. If you've followed this trilogy from the beginning, there are definitely some true moments of drama surrounding Maze Runner: The Death Cure and the final act of this film shows that the filmmakers care about wrapping this story up nicely. Here's why I believe you should check this one out, but also watch all three films back-to-back if you haven't seen them.While I'm not going to try and ruin the previous films, I would just recommend seeing the others before reading this quick synopsis. That being said, Maze Runner: The Death Cure picks up right where the second left off, as the remaining survivors of the Maze, along with a new crew of combatants, set off on a quest to gain back their friend in Minho. This is the core premise of the film, and this particular aspect of the film lends itself to a nice conclusion, but it's not the only thing going on. As the film progresses, we also get a glimpse into the corporation known as WCKD and what they've been planning all along. Viruses are wiping out the world, but who's really to trust anymore? This film raises some interesting questions, which keeps the audience on their feet.Once again, Dylan O'Brien proves himself as not only a worthy action star but a true actor in the making. I can't wait to see where he branches off to next because I've loved everything about his portrayal of Thomas from the very beginning. That's also due to some solid direction by Wes Ball. He's not a household name for film fans as of yet, but if this trilogy of films is any indication, he has a very bright future ahead of him. The way he brings out solid performances from the entire cast, with the few highlights being Ki Hong Lee's portrayal of Minho or Thomas Brodie-Sangster's Newt. Minho and Newt were always likeable characters from the beginning, but the fact that they're just as involved as Thomas now, makes the conclusion feel worthwhile.Where the film may lose some viewers is due to its slight long run time. Not to say that movies have to be less than two hours to not feel slow, but there are quite a few moments throughout this film that I felt could've been trimmed down. There are quite a few things that need to be wrapped up along the way, so I can see the need for a 142-minute duration, but it does feel its length at times. There is some terrific action spread out throughout this movie, which is another plus, but that also hurts the movie, because the movie seems to slow down quite a bit in between the excitement, which is something the other two films balanced a little better in my opinion.Without giving anything away, there is an element to all three of these films that are never brought up in this film whatsoever and I personally felt cheated as a viewer. Look, not everything needs to come full circle, but there were a couple opportunities where something could've been written into the movie as a nice bow, but just wasn't. Like I said, I enjoyed the ending to this trilogy quite a bit, but there were definitely some missed opportunities.In the end, Maze Runner: The Death Cure cares about its fanbase and closes this trilogy out on a solid note. A few tears may have been shed, a few goosebumps may have been had, and although there's nothing spectacular about these films, it's nice to see a director getting the opportunity to make all three films in the series and wrapping everything up nicely. The Maze Runner trilogy won't go down as one of the greatest trilogies of all time, but I do believe that the fanbase will expand over time. This is a solid trilogy worth sitting through. I recommend this third installment to fans of the first two and I recommend the trilogy to those who haven't given it a shot.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

52,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,3 February 2018,"The Maze Runner franchise comes to the end with its last installment, The Death Cure. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers move towards a climactic battle against WCKD to save their friends.They will have to break into the unknown Last City, where WCKD headquarters are located. A deadly mission that can finally put an end to all of the unanswered questions that they have since the maze.The YA (Young-Adult) genre is long dead and buried since these films always feel cliche and they are regularly horribly written and directed. However, when The Maze Runner was released, it felt different. It had a mysterious story and surprisingly well-directed action sequences with remarkable acting and a strong lead. Sadly, the ending was awful and it ultimately wrecked the movie. The Scorch Trials had to begin where the first film failed and despite a solid first act, it lost its track midway through, only slightly recovering in the last 15 minutes.That said, I was neither expecting the final movie of a ""fine"" trilogy to be mind-blowing or terrible. I went to the theater hoping to have a nice yet enjoyable end to a saga that I actually like for one reason or another. Truthfully, I enjoyed way more than I ever hoped to!First of all, Dylan O'Brien ... Damn, this guy can act! The production had to stop due to an injury Dylan suffered while filming and that just proves how committed he is to perform his own stunts. He carries the whole franchise and he surely has a bright future in front of him. I hope he gets the chance to star in a huge blockbuster soon because he deserves it. He embodies Thomas and flawlessly leads the film, taking us through emotional moments and exciting action set pieces.He and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Newt) share a lot of screentime together and their characters' relationship is what elevates the movie by delivering the payoff everyone wants to receive. Newt is very well-developed throughout the runtime, but the same can't be said for everyone. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) goes back to being a mere plot device and one-third of an unnecessary love triangle with Thomas and Brenda (Rosa Salazar), something that does not even come to play out.Every actor is pretty good in their own roles, but unfortunately, their characters are not developed enough for me to actually care about them. Brenda might be the only addition to the first film that works, but partially due to the excellent performance by Rosa. Of course, Giancarlo Esposito as Jorge is great as well as Barry Pepper as Vince. On the other side, Aidan Gillen (Janson) has to portray a very dull villain, Patricia Clarkson (Dr. Ava Paige) has a couple of character development scenes but not enough since she is supposed to be a big deal and Walton Goggins (Lawrence) is yet another plot device.I have to give credit where credit is due: Wes Ball has his own trilogy. How many directors can say that?! His movies are not amazing or ground-breaking, but they are way better than the ones we have experienced from the YA genre. Wes confirms the marvelous eye he has for filming action because he thoroughly nails every single action scene. They are exciting, inventive and the sense of urgency and danger feels extremely real. I have never witnessed a more impeccable handling of a shaky cam and the way he elevates the third act is impressive, to say the least.The cinematography is on point, with beautiful shots in the first act (a Mad Max: Fury Road vibe) and a very well-designed city where the second half of the film occurs. The editing is great, it has no major flaws. I can always understand where everyone is in relation to one another and once again the fantastic action sequences are improved by this. The score is really good during the movie, especially in the third act where the soundtrack alone can get some tears out of you.Every other aspect of the film has its ups and downs. The screenplay is able to correct some plot holes from the other movies but I feel that the three films struggle to tell a very simple story. Additionally, not everything the movie explains is entirely logical and it still has a lot of silly YA cliches. Despite the action scenes being awesome, they sometimes cross the line between the somewhat possible and utterly ridiculous, taking me out of the film for brief moments. The ending is also very predictable since the ""cure"" is pretty obvious since The Scorch Trials.The tone and pacing could have been more well-balanced. The first act starts with an extraordinary 10 minutes train assault scene, followed by some more well-filmed action, but then it stops. The whole second act is filled with dialogues after dialogues, which abruptly ruins the movie's great pacing and it is kind of boring. I have to wait for the third act to get my heart pumping again and it all feels a bit convoluted, proving that the film is way longer than what it should be.However, the third act compensates a lot. With all of the story's issues in mind, I was truly entertained by the last half hour. There is so much going on, there is always something in the background blowing up or getting set on fire, so the feeling of danger is almost palpable. I actually love the ending (even if it feels like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with several endings) for what it wants to be, it emotionally satisfied me and it is a suited end to an entertaining yet flawed trilogy.All in all, Maze Runner: The Death Cure is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. Its cast continues to be the standout with terrific performances by pretty much everyone, but Dylan O'Brien is the main reason why these movies work. He is incredible and I hope he gets a chance at one of the big films in the future. Wes Ball adds his own trilogy to his filmography (he directed all three movies) and confirms his phenomenal eye for filming exciting and innovative action. However, this film is JUST able to deliver a satisfying end to a simple yet very flawed story. It contains some YA cliches and it is impossible to deny the lack of logic in storytelling. The second act's boring pacing and the third act's predictability and cheesiness might be too much for viewers to handle, but the lack of secondary characters' development is what brings the movie down for me since I couldn't care less for them.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

The problem is that it is too long. There is a turn on another, there always comes one more thing and it seems that it never ends.
It is a film in which the effects, which are very good, but are too many, with something less would be better.

The ending really felt like a nice closure to the franchise and ends perfectly the film and the trilogy but I do wish for another maze runner film.

66,Ramascreen,More Action-Packed Than The Previous Films,6,17 January 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure is way way way more action-packed than the previous two films. This one is all about jam packing more than its two hours runtime with one big action piece after another and ya know what, most of them are actually pretty damn entertaining, far-fetched and at times ridiculous but still, entertaining. This movie isn't concerned about bringing you up to speed, it's more concerned about concluding the whole saga on a blaze of glory.Once again directed by Wes Ball, this is the third and final chapter of the saga starring Dylan O'Brien as Thomas who along with his fellow gladers friends, sets out to break into WCKD's so-called Last City in order to rescue Minho. This final and most dangerous mission yet will also uncover the secret behind the cure that everybody's after.
Co-starring Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen, Ki Hong Lee, Barry Pepper, Will Poulter and Patricia ClarksonI actually enjoyed the first Maze Runner movie mainly because even though I suck at solving puzzles, I do like watching other people try to solve puzzles and that's what the first movie was to me, the kids trying to outsmart the tricks that come with the glade. The second movie was just an absolute snoozer, it was so boring it almost put me to sleep twice during the screening, the pointless sand dunes journey, a tiresome government conspiracy, and a bunch of sprinting zombies just for the hell of it. And it's kinda weird that they still have Maze Runner as part of the title when clearly a literal maze is no longer involved, unless the meaning of the maze has become much deeper than that now and it clearly goes over my head.This third and final movie however, runs like a speed demon. As I said earlier, it's a series of action pieces, non-stop, one after another. If the characters aren't busy trying to evade the bad guys shooting at them, then they're probably busy rescuing a bunch of kids while attempting a high wire act, or perhaps they're busy trying to survive through the revolt that's happening around them. So much is going on, I repeat so much is going on in Maze Runner The Death Cure, but one can argue that even in the long span of 2 hours and 20 minutes, Maze Runner: The Death Cure fails to give compelling character development, be that as it may, the film keeps me awake. And some of the death scenes are quit glorious for a young adult genre. Throughout the film I get the impression that the people who made this just wanted to get it over with and they wanted to get it over with by tying up loose ends and finishing whatever subplots needed finishing even if it means it all has to come crashing down.-- Rama's Screen --",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
67,DeBBss,"First One, Great, Second, Decent, Third, Average...",6,29 January 2018,"The first Maze Runner was a great movie to start the story, and then there was the second Maze Runner movie that was a decent movie at best, and last 'Maze Runner: The Death Cure'. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as the first two. Maze Runner: The Death Cure felt like something was missing that the first one had. It was inevitable that Maze Runner: The Death Cure wasn't going to be as good as the first, but I was hoping that it would be as good as the second, but it wasn't.Story: 6/10I like the concept of a last city and the futuristic style. The whole idea of the outsiders trying to get in from the dangers of the outside is just an overused cliche, but it is a big part of the story, so I don't really care. There isn't that much issues with the story, but one of the bigger issues is the pacing. The movie is nearly two and a half hours long. Some parts of the story takes too long, and it could be shortened. By the end of the movie it gets really boring, and you end up saying ""When is it going to end"". I was hoping a little more zombies, but the only time it showed zombies was in a tunnel. If they focused more on the zombies, then I feel like the race for the cure would be more urgent. Overall the story is a bit boring with over two hours of screen time and a lack of urgency for the cure.Characters: 6/10The villains are very weak. There was no need or reason to kill the villain except to save Thomas' friends. I can't hate a villain if the villain is trying to save the world, even if he's sacrificing innocent people. The protagonists are pretty weak also, besides Thomas. Most of the characters were introduced through the first two movies, but there hasn't been a Maze Runner movie in a while, so most of the characters are forgotten. If they introduced the old characters with flashbacks from the first movies, then I think the characters would be stronger overall. The characters aren't bad, but they aren't strong. I was hoping for a little more drama when Newt died, it wasn't that dramatic when he died, mostly because Newt didn't really have a big enough part for me to care.Action: 8/10The opening scene when their chasing the train was the best part about the movie in my opinion, it was a perfect way to start the film. I think the action was well done, and there was some cheesy moments. One of the best parts was at the end of the movie. There was so much chaos and explosions, it's very relatable to the poverty in other countries. In some parts in the movie the CGI is questionable, but nothing too bad.Maze Runner: The Death Cure is the worst Maze Runner movie in the trilogy, but it's not a bad movie. The story is weak, and questionable characters. Overall Maze Runner: The Death Cure is an average movie, there was problems that could be easily fixed like the pacing and the forgettable characters.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
68,kermitkid,Satisfying Finale,9,31 March 2020,"I read the books, so I knew what to expect with this one. To be honest, I thought the book was lazy, so I expected the movie to be about the same. It wasn't. It was great! The opening scene alone was one of the best parts of this movie. It really does not slow down. It's intense action, and thrills! There were times where I was on the edge of my seat and felt my stomach drop. (I saw this in my local equivalent of an IMAX, so the screen was bigger than normal, so that may have had something to do with it.) Certain scenes drag out the inevitable ""boo!"" quite effectively. I very rarely jump at jumpscares anymore because they've become cliche, but there was one that actually made me jump. Sometimes the plot was a little too convenient and a little redundant. It seems like the goal has been met, but then the characters need to reach that same goal again. They end up in danger, get deus ex machina-ed, end up in danger again, get deus ex machina-ed, repeat for whole movie. It could have used more variety in the plot, but that's more-or-less how the book was, so I can't blame that too hard. Aidan Gillen does a great job as the villain. He's chilling, yet you like him for his charisma. There were twists and emotional moments that actually made me cry. Bring tissues, because you will cry at the end. (If you read the book, you know what I'm talking about). I'm sad to see this series end, but have enjoyed the journey since the very first one. It's a bittersweet ending, that's still very satisfying. It's the finale this trilogy deserves.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
69,theromanempire-1,lacked the unknown element of the first movies,7,6 February 2018,"If u never read the books u could not tell where the story will go from the first maze runner movie to the second maze runner sequel.
 u could easily mix up the first movie in the likes of a cube movie or of an ""unknown"" movie in which strangers are put together in a place by a madman like jigsaw.
 then at the end of the first movie u get the feeling it's more than that.
 in 2nd movie u get a total different thing. 
 u suddenly realize this is not belong in the genre of the jigsaw or the cube films but in the genre of the hunger games and the divergent movie serials.
 And u get excited as the 2nd film is the best solving a lot of questions and has great and constant action and suspense.
 unfortunately those elements of surprise are gone in the third film which is an extension of the 2nd and it could be also titled........""mino's resque"" as the movie for nearly 2 hours was about that dude's resque.
 fortunately in last 40 minutes or so the movie picked and at least we got an ending full of emotions and the outcome was positive but no way this final outing was better than the previous installments.
 I was hoping they would make also the two prequel novels in to films but now this third outing flopped in America with just 50-60 millions (it will not make above 60 millions) I wonder if they ever gonna make those prequels.
 good thing is the film is doing well so far overseas so if this saves the film then we might get the prequels in to films or we will have to read the books anyways. until last 40 minutes the movie was average with a C+ grade.
 last 40 minutes were very good with a B+ to an A - grade so overall I give this film a B- grade (7 out of 10)
 not a bad film overall and very emotional at the end but not as good as the previous films were mostly due to the lack of the surprise element.
 from the first scene u knew what u would expect from the movie to happen. I just hope they make the prequels too.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I felt that the movie has so much cringe scenes that it makes me wanna gag. We go to WCKD, than WCKD are chasing us, than they take our friend so we must go back to WCKD and that is it.

72,austin0731,A brilliant example of the YA genre done right,6,24 January 2018,"After lagging behind the initial YA novel dystopian films hype due to the lead: Dylan O'brien's injuries the Maze runner series is back in full force. I think I could safely say that the Maze runner series may just be the most solid of all the YA/dystopia series we have gotten recently. Even the one who started it all: ""The Hunger games"" seems to fall a little flat in its two part finale in spite of large going bigger than any of the other YA series ever were able to do so. We also had ""Twilight"", which needless to say was not well received and the ""Divergent series"" which fell so flat it is now turning into a TV series. THere are many other such examples, ""The City of bones"", ""The Giver""......But the gift that keeps on giving is the maze runner series, while never the most amazing films they were constantly very strong in spite of a slight slip in the second installation. I think another major point that was done well by the series is the way that it manages to establish drastically different tones, the first had a mysterious tone, the second a more horror tone while the death cure had a more emotional and sombre tone as it concludes the story and sees the departure of some of the characters.The Death cure picks up right in the middle of action as we are quickly reintroduced to the characters in a brilliant action sequence that instantly puts audiences right back into the story. In fact, the general pacing of the film was quick and high intensity, resulting in the fast paced and exciting end results that never really slows down unless to establish a reflective or emotional moment. Complete with a brilliant teen cast delivering wonderful performances including the aforementioned Dylan O'brien and many more. The Death cure was a wonderful end to a trilogy that has stayed fairly consistent, fun and exciting and is a wonderful example of the YA genre done right, unfortunately it likely also marks the end of the genre.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
73,brunovanael,Dumb,4,25 March 2021,"Great first movie, but downhill with every episode. Not the best choice for a title as there hardly is a maze.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
74,FelipeCarrillo,A maze which may have had many other exits.,6,15 April 2018,"""The Death Cure"" began its commercial run as one of the first offers of the year as it was the month of January that served to enjoy the last adventure into WCKD's roots for long-time fans who were still true and curious moviegoers who wished to overlook the first two films - an unhealthy decision. - Briefly, the film returns seasoned as usual with dangerous-action scenes, two of all them at the level of its predecessor, with some surprising sacrifices plot but with an incompetent and illogical resolution that leaves a rather bitter taste on the world of this franchise. It was supposed to make a big name for itself, which, sadly, did not happen that way. I can imagine screenwriters and executives, avid for more but willing less, sitting at the same table discussing the different - absolute? - closing possibilities to this treacherous trilogy. They were of course conditioned by the book written by Dashner from which they had to adhere their ideas, however, it's perceptible the dependent additive has managed to balance the degree of honesty and divergence with the inspiration source, screenwriters' narrative additions and executives' postulates, in a comparable amount, are even praiseworthy at certain times, but not fascinating and even jarring and laughable. At first glance and although the writers could not move freely at all - although in Hollywood times we see that this isn't an impediment -, betting to go back a place from they just get out seems incoherent, a simple mechanism setting up more action and ostentatious moments, only voided sporadically by tools that blind for a limited time extremely melodramatic lines or melancholic dramatic scenes. The story is commonly designed, that is to say, we follow the fight of the hero, he's defeated several times, but finally wins, the interesting and peculiar thing is that on the way loses important supporters, ergo there are two significant heart-breaking moments that take a vital role in main character's personal development that boost the purpose of destroying WCKD. It's hard to find ways to turn a standard ending into a memorable one, but not impossible, and I don't mean pessimistic conclusions, just, getting something different, something the spectator doesn't expect, sadly, this feature film chooses common solutions, falling into also habitual cinematographic oblivion.It's already a custom that over-the-top set-pieces offer good-approach choreographies, which, although are not at the level of those present in the second installment, excite and provide a dazzling experience as soon as a cohort of infected arises. These moments are acceptable and even enjoyable, however, there are a couple of sequences that go beyond. On this occasion, the first sequence shares the setting of one of the previous installments, with the daring young runners jumping, as if they were superheroes, from the top of a building. The second and personally the best-sketched-and-accomplished sequence is starring Rosa Salazar and an autobus full with innocents, and despite it doesn't get a completely true result, it made my hair stand on end for the fate of the kids in that unstable bus; an excellent moment, the only one I'd say.Aesthetically, it does not become a focus of praise either. Keeping a predominant place for darkness and a little presence of vivid colors, the film becomes a little dull, no different settings or racking focus are used, simply, the camera follows or remains static to the actions of the characters. This doesn't mean that it is lackluster and anodyne, it's just one more rescue in which the colors don't have the role they should, leaving expectant to the spectator by a much better visual splendor. Of course, special effects used to get this futuristic city are fantastic and complex, they never feel synthetic or manipulative, as in the compendium of buildings or whitish laboratories take place two key moments. Thus, the conclusion of film trilogy ""Maze Runner"" at the hands of Wes Ball, the same filmmaker of all the three movies, provides an independent film, endless, but dynamic, laughable but entertaining, cliché about the hopeful fate of its characters. ""The Death Cure"" shows a good handful of set-pieces and won't mean a tortuous or incoherent time for those who decide to buy a ticket, however, for the most loyal fans and readers will be an idea that relegates great opportunities to stick an ideal conclusion, predicted and lack of the surprise factor. Even so, as a whole, the saga, despite being below Katniss Everdeen's tetralogy but far above ""Tris"" Prior's unfinished tetralogy, is worthy of a Sunday afternoon to enjoy run-of-the-mill Hollywood adaptations brimmed with action, where what matters is not how getting out of the maze, but, ironically, looking for a way to get back in.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
75,carlos37andre,Why do you had to force the romance?,5,11 January 2020,"I have to confess, that I'm split while writing this review. I'll try to explain.I love the ""cold opening"" of the movie, I mean, I get that many people will compare with Mad Max and, as you might expect, it's not as good, but, c'mon guys, it's still pretty cool, they did a great job here.I'll say upfront the many things I thought were awesome about the movie. I thought the last hour was (besides some specific 15 minutes - which I will approach later) amazing. Love the actions scenes, love (in a sad way) Newt's end, the whole scene of Thomas trying to get him on the ship, was cool. Anyways, all the action here I thought it was handle in a competent way. It's entertaining and a great ending to the trilogy.Also, I shout out for the producers, the studio and everyone involved in the movie for just not trying to slip one book in 2 movies, it worked with Harry Potter, but we saw that, well, it's usually not a good call (Hunger Games, Divergent...).Now, before I address the elephant in the room I have to talk about some points, I'll just leave some questions, and you could please try to answer them: If they (Wicked) are truly trying just to aka ""save humanity"" with all of this, why leave those other people behind the wall? For that, you may answer ""dude, they are not cool, you didn't get it right"". Ok, then... what is Teresa's excuse then? I mean, she has to know that there are hundreds of people living in such conditions (and apparently not all of them are infected by the virus). But I'll address Teresa in a moment, no worries. Why do they go into the city in that first scene? Couldn't he just say ""hey, dude, your bit*# is on the town, we could use her"". Do they had to risk their lives just for him to see her with a freaking binoculars?But all of this, I can (almost all) ignore. The only thing I can't is how they try to humanize (or give her a... reason?) Teresa. Bit*#, I don't give a damn that she tried to save one girl by torturing Minho! This is not gonna make me like her again. As I said before, if she is that good, why the hell she doesn't say anything about the hundreds of people outside of the city suffering?! She knows (!) Wicked is up to no good. She knows (!!!).I mean, it would be ok, if they do that, and, even with that, I would be ok, and would let it go, only if Thomas also just say ""ok, see ya, have a happy life being a traitor"". But, well, is a teen story, so... of course he would still come back for her even after Newt is already dead! What's the point?! Why would comeback there anyways?! ""Well, to kill them"" you might say, sure, and after all of that, I would still be fine if he did that. But... yeah, he doesn't. Man, wtf, he was almost buying that old jerk talk too. Jesus, dude, what is wrong with you? C'mon.And, yeah, we all know the end. ""I've tried Thomas"". Tried what? What did I miss? Wtf!!! They kiss, of course she makes a sacrifice (cause the rest of the guys wouldn't be that stupid, I assume) and dies (that part was cool, though).The movie would have been, for me at least, a 8/10, almost 9, if they just make Thomas walk off after Newt's death. Littlefinger (yes, I will call him that) could appear there, they could fight, Thomas kills him, and that's it. F# that bit*#. Everyone's happy at the end (which is a great scene by the way, the letter and stuff... until he writes her name in the stone). Anyways, if you read that and is a fan of this type of love teen story, you are probably screaming at me right now (I mean, I doubt that a fan of the movie and the romance would even get this far in the review lol). But, yeah, you are wrong, this romance is bs, it didn't need to happen. I love the first two movies, and I like the end of the second one, mainly because is a mind blowing ""whaaat? She is a traitor! Omg!"". But no, I won't accept that everything was ok, and everybody would forgive her, after that many people get kill because of her. Nop.Overall, is a good movie, there are some great action here, and you can be easily entertain by it. I just hate that 20 minutes in the end, when they try to wrap up the romance when there was no reason to do that. I hate with all the strength I have. I'll just give it a 5, because of the reason I've said early here, those scenes are damn good entertaining.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
76,skpn123,Perfection with flaws,10,5 September 2021,"I have just re-watched this series for the second time and I have to say I do not recall being so struck by its brilliance first watching: Maybe it is the current events and the eerie cross events, may it is the pure emotionality that the young cast are able to emanate without it ever feeling for a minute it is fake or overdone.Dylan O'Brien is the master of emotional scenes and it seemed that the young cast rose to meet him there in stunning and lovely ways. From Chuck, to Newt and even Theresa whose well-meaning intentions but misguided direction remind me of friends of mine as they play out the current global events.I totally loved Gally's redemption - I never saw it coming which made it a really fun twist. And I can't even talk about Newt - way too heart-breaking yet inspiring and hopeful at the same time. The end brings the kind of closure to the story arc while leaving many possibilities open for future spin offs.Please note there are a lot of dark scenes so not for primary age or sensitive viewers.I only hope there are more teen shows of this calibre in the future.

Much of the plot you really had to switch off from and suspend belief. The kids literally are parkour genius's and crack shots and are seemingly able to overpower, outfight and outshoot trained soldiers. The plot made no sense. The nasty corporation actually have good honest intentions and want to save the world. Yes they go about it terribly, maybe if they just explained it to the kids rather than forcibly experiment on them they might actually help out voluntarily. Thomas and co are spoilt brats. Thomas is the cure in the end but rather than honourably save mankind at the end, he decides to keep it a secret and chill out in a hippy commune with his little buddies. Why they also decided to wipe out an entire, post apocalyptic functioning city rather than live in it is beyond me. I could not figure out why they regularly tried to storm the city with loads being shot and killed, rather than use the secret tunnel which they knew about and used to gain access to the city.

Do not expect clever plot twists, intelligent dialogue or original and witty scenes Expect hollywood action movie cliche after cliche and just sit back, relax and enjoy the shooting, running, chasing and stuff getting blown up non-stop for more than 2 hours.

 This movie has done an absolutely excellent job entertaining the target audience, more serious movie critics simply need to come down from their high horses and realize this movie is not to be taken seriously.

I was suprised by how much they changed and altered the first movie. But the second movie I was SHOCMED by then pretty much remaking the story. I was pisses by this change as certai characters are either completely pushes aside or changed. The third one I felt the same way. The only thing I liked about the movies were the guys who played Gally and Chuck. I also LOVED the cinematography and VFX. They looked amazing. But the amazing plots of the booms were totally changed. I have very mixed feelings as I can understand why they did this. Certain things written in the books wouldn't have worked as well on film. They also had to alter certain plot moments to make it more cinematic. But other times they remove really amazing plot elemts from the books and add stuff in.

Visually stunning movie is full of action and 3D works quite well. It is just too bad that they haven't been focused enough to use of it. Stereophonic images is not enough to assert to use of it.Like two previous movie, story is quite simple. Just running from act to act, some action and shooting. Some horror scenes with zombies are okay, but not scary enough. Outright almost two and a half an hour length is just too long and tedious.Visually movie is great to watch, but it is too bad that they haven't focused enough of use of 3D. It is good ending of series, but nothing special. Visuality of the movie makes it worth of a movie ticket. It is best to seen from big screen.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
86,Doublej20005,A Decent Climax for the Franchise,6,30 January 2021,"I'm generally a big fan of YA Films, so I figured I'd like the Maze Runner films, and despite their flaws I definitely do enjoy them. As for those flaws in this one specifically, the dialogue here is really cliché. I was literally whispering the line that I thought each character would say next to myself, and I was right a surprisingly large amount of the time. The visuals are still pretty good, but not as good as its predecessor, although that might just be because of the change in location. The villains are also comically bad, especially Jansen, who is in no way intimidating.But still, from the solid characters, enjoyable action and satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this film a whole lot. There were some great individual sequences during the middle which helped to keep me engaged (although I do think the runtime is a touch too long), and I still just enjoy seeing these characters in these scenarios. The emotional moments weren't perfect or even good, but I think they worked well enough. And overall, even though my film buff brain is telling me that this isn't a good film, I can't help but at the very least enjoy it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
87,valen060,Bittersweet Ending to An Intricate Maze-Running Ride,7,17 February 2018,"Following immediately where 2015's ""The Scorch Trials"" left off, I have to say that after everything the main characters went through in the previous films, it's loaded with so much triumph and tragedy I couldn't even fathom on how they must feel to endure so much.So Thomas, his remaining fellow Gladers, and outside allies are now forced to fend for themselves after their only female member Teresa supposedly betrays them by leaving with the mysterious organization WCKD. It's up to Thomas to figure out the mystery of what makes himself so important in WCKD's true purpose.As thought-provoking as each pivotal moment revealed, it left me even more curious on seeing how this objective would play out. Despite how watered down the most violent and disturbing scenes showed (like already at the boundary line of a zombie film), stars Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Sangster, and Kaya Scodelario delivered amazing performances. Some parts of the plot did fall short on the true intentions WCKD was trying to accomplish with a so-called ""cure"" as well, but what had me stay focused was seeing that the answer would lie where the adventure initially started for the Gladers: The infamous labyrinth. Director Wes Ball definitely made it this far by showing a pathway to how Maze Runner stands out alongside the other familiar young adult novels.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
88,Field78,"An adequate, but not aMAZEing conclusion",6,2 February 2018,"The finale of the Maze Runner trilogy has taken a bit longer to arrive than expected, due to a severe accident involving leading man Dylan O'Brien on set. That can cause all kinds of false expectations, but now that it's finally here, we can assess whether it is the movie that satisfactorily completed a series that was one of the more enjoyable among all those young adult franchises that flooded the cinemas in the last 10 years. And my answer is both yes and no.Let's start with the good: the unwritten sequel rule that each next installment should be bigger and better is certainly followed. The opening scene involving a train chase/fire fight has so much momentum and action that we are immediately sucked into the story, and the rest of the film also features several epic setpieces and grand-scale action scenes. This is a big budget action movie where you can see where the bucks went, which is always a good thing. Like the first two movies, the post-apocalyptic production design is not merely a backdrop, it is shot with so much care that it almost becomes a character in its own right. And all the dilapitated ruins form a nice contrast to the pristine, state-of-the-art city that is the scenery for the second and third act (after all, it's science fiction). A compliment must be made to the special effects department; no doubt plenty of CGI has been used, but to great effect because I can't easily tell when and where.What is really too bad is that after that high-octane beginning, the story gets into a bit of a slump. The second film made it clear that WCKD is bad, and that a group called the Right Arm is trying to stop their nefarious experiments on young people. Thomas and his Glader friends joined that group, determined to help take WCKD down. Unfortunately, not much of that noble sentiment remains in The Death Cure (TDC). Not to spoil too much, but the story doesn't take the most exiting direction after the beginning. While I understand that not every opposition can muster up a Rebel Alliance to take on an empire, this lack of delivering on that promise definitely causes the plot to limp after this development. It doesn't help that we learn of other, even more fanatical groups that openly oppose WCKD. There was potential for an interesting subplot here that sadly remains underused.Our main character Thomas (O'Brien) also gets curtailed by this. He only seems interested in getting his kidnapped friend Minho back. And that's where we see the film's (and arguably the series') main flaw: in all that action and mystery, there never was much time for rich plotting and character development. It didn't matter too much for the first movie, because it had a titular maze to drive the plot; and although some people didn't like The Scorch Trials much, it had some twists and interesting action to keep things going. But TDC feels a bit empty, with its minimal plot stretched over more than 2 hours. Almost the entire first half relies on a rescue mission for someone we barely know or care about, making it a boring affair (save for some strategically scripted zombies) and the movie way too long. The fact that Dylan O'Brien isn't a very charismatic lead didn't matter that much when he was still running for his life, but now we are supposed to relate to him and Minho, and the film falters as a result. It would have made a real difference if either Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) or Teresa (Kyla Scodelario) had been abducted, as they are much less one-dimensional, but they have other roles to play in the story.The second half fortunately shows improvements, with the legitimacy of Teresa's betrayal as one of the more interesting subplots. It arguably makes her the most interesting character in the film, and it serendipitously leads to a revelation about the cure that plays a major role in the end. Both Newt and Teresa's parts in the story give the movie some of the heart and substance that is lacking from the rest. The epic climax is another great sequence where action and emotion come together in a satisfying way, and the epilogue keeps things sufficiently ambiguous.That is not to say that the second half fixes all the flaws in the story. The other movies had a challenge to compensate for plot, and this movie seems to be missing both. The Maze was the obvious test in the first film, the second movie had WCKD, zombies and a very nice apocalyptic landscape doubling for a maze, but the third one lacks a properly challenging environment. The trailer sold the futuristic city as the new maze, but in the movie it is surprisingly easily navigated, and the protagonists have no difficulty getting into anything. The lack of a decent nemesis may also be to blame. Dr. Ava Paige was teased as the main antagonist in the first two movies, but she is so underused here that she hardly seems to matter anymore. We are left with Aiden Gillen as Mr Janson, who falls back on his duplicitous Littlefinger act from Game of Thrones, but his lack of relatable motivation and some questionable actions make him a token villain who is only there to ensure an ending.So in conclusion, TDC wraps up the story of three movies, but it is hard to deny that most of the drama was already used up in the previous two, leaving too little to justify a 140-minute ending. Technically it is well made and enjoyable on the action level, and its flaws are not too unforgivable. But unlike the Harry Potter or Hunger Games series, we never get the feeling that all the set-up of previous movies really pays off in the end, or that its plots and subplots come together in one glorious conclusion. Thank God for that awesome beginning and end, though.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
89,antoniokowatsch,Underwhelming finale,4,7 June 2018,"Yes, I didn't really enjoy this movie. There's no point in sugar-coating it. I had my fair share of expectations for the movie because I enjoyed the first movie so much. Heck, even the second movie had its moments. But not this one.
The story is pretty straightforward; the protagonists try to rescue one of their own while the ""bad guys"" try to find a ""cure"". If you've seen the prequels you already know the power dynamics between the ""rebels"" and the ""establishment"". If you haven't seen any of the Maze Runner movies yet I'd suggest you to watch the first one. It's still one of my favorite Young Adult sci-fi movies to date (and the strongest link in this trilogy).
One of my main gripes with the movie was the fact that almost all the deuteragonists feel superfluous in the sense that they don't really contribute much to the story as a whole. The only exception here is Brenda. The movie does have a lot of action scenes but isn't exactly exploring deep philosophical questions. In the first movie e.g. when the protagonists find out the truth behind the maze we're exposed to an interesting ethical dilemma. A dilemma that at least explains the motivations of the ""bad guys"" and why their actions could be justified. As a whole however this ethical dilemma isn't profound enough to act as a proverbial basis for the entire trilogy. It works for the first two movies but then becomes gimmicky in the third.From a storytelling-perspective the movie makes 3 big mistakes that end up breaking the movie. The first one I've already mentioned; the fact that most of the characters in this movie don't really do anything that's ""important"" is bad writing. But let's not dwell on that fact. The other two mistakes are in my humble opinion even bigger deal-breakers.
In the synopsis of the movie it reads that the legendary last city is protected/surrounded by the deadliest maze of all. Well, don't get too excited about it. Even though that's true we never actually get to see that maze. I know, I was disappointed too. Really disappointed. It would've been the perfect ending for this trilogy. If the movie ended with the protagonists making it through the mega-maze the whole story would've come full-circle. Unfortunately, that's not the ending that this movie showcases.
And last but not least I'd like to criticize the fact that the ""bad guys"" find the ""cure"". Now, normally I would've prefaced this part with a ""Spoiler Disclaimer"" but given the fact that this movie is literally titled ""The Death Cure"" I don't think that's necessary. It's pretty obvious; one might say ""too obvious"". And that is a problem. It's as if they spoiled the movie deliberately. They're literally alluding to the ending by nonchalantly inserting the keyword into the title. And no, there are no earth-shattering plot-twists in this movie. Yes, there are some surprises here and there but they're not enough to save the movie. If the rebels had discovered the cure e.g. it would've made the story more interesting. That way they could've cured the infected and by doing so build an army to rival the obviously over-powered antagonists. It would've leveled the playing field and raised the stakes for the ""bad guys"".",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

This story was probably written by an 8 year old.The rest of the movie follows just one recipe: the characters get into impossible situations and then a friend of theirs comes to their rescue. Seriously, that's it. The main characters take every wrong decision possible and they get lucky. The characters did nothing on their own... so how could I cheer for them? The tag line for the movie should have been ""A bunch of reckless idiots on a suicide mission to save their friend (that nobody cares about) in a high tech city with unrealistically low security systems"".The bad guys sometimes shoot to kill, sometimes they say ""freeze"" just when the directing demands it, so that they luckily escape the bullets or luckily get saved by a friend. Some of the characters die for dramatic purposes. Nobody else but the main girl does any actual work there and luckily she has a breakthrough with the cure. Only the captured friend is treated super badly and coincidentally he is super important for the research. And in the end, only the protagonist was the one with the cure inside him. Wow such great and important characters! Why they threw them in the deadly maze again?The cure was something that troubled me from the first movie and it was as stupid as ever. The cure was gone but that's ok because people can go and live on an island forever happy. How come the rest of humanity living on islands didn't survive, it's beyond me.Good graphics and effects.

I didn't like Death Cure it's not in due of the hype, because even before, my expectations about the last installment were not so high.
The opening sequence reminds Mad Max, it's a good action scene, but then the main story starts being a little boring. It's almost 2 hours and half with the characters saying always the same and doing the same stuff. It would be better if this film was shorter.
There are some good scenes, and a lot of scenes that could be better done, the poor final act is an example about how some scenes could be better done. Even the ""zombies"" (they have a different name in this film) are weak in this film, there is a zombie outbreak and we don't see a lot of zombies.Sometimes, Death Cure looks like a soft Resident Evil or a soft Mad Max for young viewers.

 In 2014, we were introduced to a rogue set of teenagers trying to get by in a maze full of wicked things, until one day a boy shows up to dismantle the maze and to bring down the very government that was keeping them from fulfilling their true purpose in life - survival. 
 In 2015, that same band of teenagers that were stuck in a maze finally gets their purpose to bring down WCKD - the agency that was controlling them and using them to build their own personal army of hybrids to take down the world system. The Scorch Trials would be the undoing of the band of friends, but they came out on top of it all. 
 Now we come to 2018, 3 years later, it's the end and WCKD is back at it again but this time, one girl could change the fate of the way that we look at how we are made. Thomas, the teenage boy who was brought into the maze, the one that helped his friends escape from the maze, now faces the ultimate decision and prize to give up something so precious that it would be the end of him - his blood to change the mutation of the world. 
 In a word: AWESOMENESS! The Maze Runner Series is by far the best dystopian societal movie since The Hunger Games. This movie ends on a high note where the victors come out on top as always. Wes Ball creates this world to the pristine uniqueness and gives us the words off the page all thanks to T.S. Nowlin.

103,rupert-ian,Enjoyable end to the series,7,25 March 2018,"Looking through the other reviews I have to laugh at how many 1 out of 10 or 2 out of 10 reviews there are. I refuse to believe any fans of the first two could honestly think this movie deserves anything near that low. A 1 or 2 out of 10 would be something like Troll 2, not The Death Cure. There were definitely a few scenes where I predicted what was going to happen. Big deal, that happens in most movies these days. It's 2018, I dare ANYONE to write a movie without a scene or two like that. There are only so many possible outcomes to a scene. The love story frustrated me, but I don't really hold that too much against the movie. I expected things to go one way, they didn't. The way they did go is hard for me to relate to due to the character development, or lack thereof in this instance. The action is awesome. The movie is long, but didn't feel that way at all. I have to laugh at all the reviewers with the attention span of a gnat crying about the run time. 
Those people are the reasons we see so many movies squashed into two hour max time limits, which severely screws up a LOT of movies. Well, thank the impatient people that can't go more than 2 hours without checking their social media. Maybe the all theaters need to start having intermissions so all the people with unhealthy phone addictions can get a quick fix. That way we won't have to have all our movies limited to less than two hours by the studios, making many of them a jumbled mess with obvious material cut out?The ending of this finale was fitting, I enjoyed the letter from Newt. It did a great job of bringing you back to their beginning in the Glade and reminding you just how far our first group has come from the minute they were shot up an elevator with no memory or identity. So, if you enjoyed the first two I think you will enjoy this one as well. I am not sure what the 1 and 2 out of 10 reviewers were expecting, but this movie deserves at least a 7 rating IMO. It's pretty close as far as the avg rating goes, even with the ridiculously low ratings by the impatient minds out there. I refuse to bump my rating up to imbalance those who rate movies like a child crying for a candy bar at the checkout aisle.  If a 10 dollar movie ticket is going to make you feel like you broke the bank if you don't end up loving the movie, wait and catch it on RedBox. Don't take it out on the movie with a ridiculously low rating. 7/10, a much better finale than Hunger Games got.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

And then they went and forced redemption and unnecessary romance on us. The action and the pace in the movie were spot on. Not too fast but not lagging. Also the music and camera made it a feast. I was rooting for that ragtag group so much. I really enjoyed their friendships. I even liked the villains. Teresa could have been such an interesting character. Someone doing very bad things with good intentions. I could have somehow lived with her realizing at the last moment that she didn't really choose the best side. I could have even lived with Thomas's conflicted feelings for her. But that terrible so-called romantic moment and that smooch that was so not necessary made me want to leave the cine. At least they didn't ride together into the sunset. That I would have not able to forgive. As good as the action was - and it was very well made, what elevated this movie for me were the relationships. Between Gladers. Brenda and Thomas. Brenda and Jorge. Vince and the kids.

But now it is time for the Maze Runner to come to its conclusion, and after seeing the Death Cure, I can proudly say that this Maze Runner ended...mostly the same as its predecessors.It can be fun at times, sure, but the film still suffers from the usual problems the other Maze Runner films usually have, like a story that is heavily reliant on cliches and has the trilogy's signature predictable moments, characters who mostly feel as basic as they can get, and a mostly slow pace that isn't really as problematic as Scorch Trials, but it doesn't mean much when the film itself turns out to have a longer runtime than that in order to tie up loose ends. Yes, the actors did a great job, but you know they've always had minimal materials to work with, and it can feel like many of them don't want to go back when this is over!However, even with those flaws, it does still have some prominent strengths the franchise is known for, and it even includes some new aspects in order to make itself a minor improvement from Scorch Trials. Just like the other movies, Death Cure is an AMAZING looking piece of eye candy, delivering on great visual effects and selling on the teen dystopia genre in a convincing way with all the sets, costumes, and visual style in order to expand the world it's set in, on top of having thrilling action scenes to quicken the pace. That, and it does get progressively better as the film continues, having an action-oriented and hectic third act full of intensity, tying up as many loose ends as possible, and finishing off Thomas's journey with tears and relief, resulting in an exciting and INTENSE finale that proves that you can still have fun with the franchise.Overall, this is exactly how you describe the franchise.

114,elizabeth-12994,Amazing,10,21 September 2019,"I thought this was an absolutely superb ending to a great trilogy. It was filled with action, adventure, comical moments and some quite sad parts.The acting was phenomenal, especially that of Dylan O'Brien and Thomas Brodie Sangster. I thought the soundtrack was good as well, but it wasn't a Hans Zimmer, but who can be?I think you need to see these films for what they are. I know many people will rate a trilogy like this down because it wasn't as good as the book, or they left out some vital parts. Coming from someone who has also read the books, I know you can't include everything, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. You really begin to feel for the characters. These films definitely deserved higher and better ratings than what it has got, and I'm sure many would agree with me.Another thing is, some people came to this trilogy thinking it was going to be 100% realistic, which it is, but in its own way. It is woven together tightly so is hard to unthread it, but it is science fiction, but people didn't seem to know that when they came to watch it. If you're going to enjoy it, you need to let yourself become engrossed in the movie, like I did.Special effects weren't amazing but they are what they are. They were saved by an awesome plot line. You need to respect these films for what they are to enjoy them, and understand sometimes you need to let your mind drift a little.I recommend watching this trilogy because they are incredible, and very entertaining.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

The 2nd movie was a bit of a coming to age for the cast through the hardships they had gone through, and some great additions to the cast. This last one is predictable, full of action but does hold some genuine surprises. I wasn't so idiotic to walk into these movies thinking they were made for me, someone who just turned 30. The movie cover for the first movie immediately informed me that I was not in the target demographic. This is a teen movie, riding the surf that The Hunger Games created. Once that was in my head I could switch off my brain a little and enjoy the movie for what it was. The same goes for this movie. It does hold tension, but it's very easy to guess the outcome of almost every scene. The one quarrel I do have with this film is the inclusion of some new characters that didn't make much sense, whilst not building up on some of the existing characters that had been introduced in the 2nd movie. Overall I have enjoyed this franchise. It hasn't been the most solid set of movies ever, but once again, I know I'm not the target demographic.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

It's clearly not perfect, but I don't think anyone walks into the last installment of a young adult trilogy thinking is Oscar worthy. It's fun, entertaining and packed with action. The negative side is that is unnecessarily long, especially the last couple of scenes and that it feels quite predictable at times (again, young adult, based upon a book trilogy, we've seen some of these story lines before) Definitely way better that the second part, that movie was truly disappointing.
I also wanted to point out that I've only read the first book and even though the movie is really different I like them both, because the main aspects of it remained intact. I didn't read the rest and by comments by fans of the book I've learned that the writers changed pretty much everything after the first film. I can get why people are so upset.

140,samuellickiss,Umm...there's a film in here somewhere,5,15 April 2018,"*Written from the perspective of someone who has read the first book only and seen the previous films*. First of all, I'm glad I waited until I could borrow the DVD off a friend rather than paid to see it in the cinema. It's a long film, clocking in at nearly 2.5 hours. I'd be lying if I said I sat in front of my TV and watched it start to finish without distraction. The film opens with a big action set piece - Thomas and team attempting a train heist. It's cool - nicely shot with decent enough acting. However, my first distraction came when I realised I had no idea who anyone, asides from Thomas, was. I'd completely forgotten the events of The Scorch Trials (which says a lot about the quality of that film...) so I ended up revising the plot on Wikipedia. There's not really anything of substance in the film. The action set pieces are cool, but they're not Mad Max Fury Road cool (I mean, what is?). The music does the job, but that's all it does. At some point while watching the film I decided to find out who the composer was. I'd never heard of Joe Paesano, and there's a reason for that, because the score is devoid of melody (just chords played on strings the whole way through) and completely forgettable. He's no John Williams or Danny Elfman. The costuming is fine, but not Star Wars The Phantom Menace fine (costumes were definitely a redeeming feature of that film). The acting is fine, the editing is fine, the directing is fine, the story is fine...it's all just fine. To be honest I'm not really sure what the plot is. There's a generic zombie virus that's infecting people (because that's never been done before...) and some kids have special blood that's immune or something. I don't know, it's not clear. The bad guys are experimenting on said kids to develop a cure, but apparently that's a bad thing so a war breaks out. The movie is so desperate to have an antagonist that it has to be manufactured at every possible moment. Littlefinger (or whatever he's supposed to be called in the film) has no obvious motive for anything. He and Effie from Skins plus generic scientist lady sort of do some sciencey stuff and yeah it probably wouldn't get past your average ethics committee nowadays, but this is a post-apocalyptic society with a virus busy killing everyone, so perhaps we can be a bit flexible on this. The problem is that everybody wants the same thing, including Littlefinger, who's the big bad evil, and really that's the problem. I'm still not sure why Littlefinger is the bad guy. I'm still not sure why Thomas is the good guy, either. The film tells us this, but it seems like the whole conflict could be avoided if everyone just sat down and had a conversation about the whole thing. They're trying to kill each other, but why?I've even googled this, and I've yet to find a website that will enlighten me,The film is attempting to go for moral complexity, and fails utterly in this respect. Game of Thrones does moral complexity, and Littlefinger is at the scheming heart of that, but the whole Maze Runner franchise is just confusing. It seems like James Dashner had the idea of a teenage boy waking up in a maze with no memory tasked with escaping it and thought, 'yeah, I like that - that's cool.' And it is - the first book (and film, to an extent) are pretty neat. The problem is, Dashner seems to have realised at some point that he needed to explain why the maze existed in the wider conflict. At that point, Dashner lost all his creativity, because the Maze you see in the first film/book are quite honestly the only original ideas he had. Overall, that's the problem. It's merely passable. It just exists. I'm getting married next year, and I hope to have children of my own. I suspect when they're old enough I'll read the Harry Potter books with them and watch the films. A few years on from that, maybe I'll introduce them to the Hunger Games, but the Maze Runner (and Divergent and a lengthy host of cloned YA stories) will have been long forgotten, relegated to the part of Netflix you have to scroll several pages down to find. There's no longevity here. I don't regret seeing it. As an aspiring novelist myself, it's purely mediocre films like this that tell me a lot about what not to do (that said, I'm guessing Dashner made a fair amount of dosh from it all).",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
141,zadok-332-444684,Two and a half hours of pure boredom,2,21 May 2018,"It's really hard to put into words what this film is about, because nobody makes any sense whatsoever. A bunch of egocentric people on every side fight for vanity, for their utterly stupid version of a good life. Neither could I relate to anybody, nor was there reason to any of it. Those that fight for mankind's survival are the bad guys, but they (like all others) seem to believe violence, ignorance and self-interest the best means to go about it. The ""good guys"" fight, kill and destroy for a handful of friends aparently - at the expense of global civilization. Sadly even that ""love"" doesn't convince: It's just a presupposed facade most of the time. Admittedly this poor excuse for a plot doesn't give the cast much of a chance to convince. Even so it's mostly embarrassing. Not making sense isn't always a problem for a film, but there's really nothing here. It's dull, flat, meaningless AND stupid.If this is what we are at mankind is doomed indeed.

142,Grumphy,This is no cure. This is poison.,2,25 January 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death CureI haven't seen the first two films. Not that it really matters. I just didn't really know what to expect. So I was hoping for some moderately adequate post-apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy film. Boy was I wrong. All I got was moronic garbage in pretty much all the colours of the spectrum. The story was basic, not to say primitive. You want to pretend you can see the future? Go see that film because everything that you think is going to happen, is going to happen. Perhaps books were written better and offered some details that made it readable, but watching it offered me no pleasure, because to suspend disbelief I can look past WHY things are happening on the screen, but not HOW they are happening. For example, I am willing to believe that a kid can take out, with a handgun, from a considerable distance, several trained combat units armed with assault rifles, returning the fire to no success, but there better be a dogdamned reason to show for it. The dialogue is vile and riddled with every kind of cliché you've ever heard. AND seen. Characters shallow and show no real progression. Causality is non-existent, everything happens because the script says so. And this does not even scratch the surface of the tip of the iceberg. The stupidity of the scenes is mind blowing. I'd hate to think that it's so because the film aimed at teens. I can only blame the director Wes Ball for having balls to think this is OK. The film is not even mindless, it's an outright attack against a functioning cerebral process. Which, maybe, for a teen doesn't really matter all that much because they don't know any better. But a film director should. You shouldn't talk down to children just because it's an easy way out. All it shows is that the film doesn't matter. That the film makers didn't care.

The third installment is a justice made to the Trilogy.",7,4 February 2018,"The third and last installment in the series, Maze Runner: The Death Cure takes off with the Gladers - Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) on a dangerous mission to save one of their friends, Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and, of course, the world from a terrifying end. Among the last few to have remained immune to Flare, the deadly virus that has laid siege on a majority of the world's population, the Gladers are running against time to find a cure. As they attempt to sneak into the Last City, they encounter a series of obstacles that threaten their very existence.The actors portray their characters extremely well, especially Dylan, he can truly make the audience feel what he's feeling. Although character development was not a strong point in this film, I feel it didn't need to be. Because if you've seen the other two films, you already know how the characters are and how they feel towards other characters and what they believe is right and wrong. For me, the first two films provided the character development, this was just the ending. There are some very powerful and emotional scenes in this film especially towards the end (I, myself did tear up at one point), and the ending, I feel, was really satisfying.Coming to the cinematic experience, the cinematography was top notch. In recent times it may be the second best to Blade Runner 2049. The Vfx was stainless. Kudos to the cinematography team. The movie though had some loose plots but the pros do cover up these potholes. 
The first half was a bit laggy as compared to the other first two parts of this franchise but the second half kept the audience at the edge of their seats. Second half was very well executed. Although the movie could have been trimmed off 10 mins but the cinematography covers this up. 
All the humor were well placed and the action scenes were fast paced which suited the Story line.

The first half of the film would have you pulling your hair out cause of the lack of momentum in the flow of the plot.When you pass the train of 'boredom' and get into the second half of the film you'll be relieved because the film catches up the necessary momentum without being too slow leading up to the climax.The down side here is that it gets coated with several unintentionally comical illogical scenes. ( specially the one where Janson decides to stare down at Thomas and fellow fugitives who are fleeing with asset without shooting them when he clearly had a pretty good shot)
Having said that I must also compliment the performances..
Specially, Dylan O'Brien who is the highlight of the film with his convincing performance as Thomas yet again..

Overall, it was phenomenal. The soundtrack is good, the action is intense, the sound effects are on point, and there's not a dull moment for the entire time. I only have two gripes that prevented me from giving it a full 10; number one being that Thomas' and Brenda's relationship I don't believe was portrayed accurately from the original book. Any other movie goer would never notice so that's not a huge deal. Number two is that I'm frustrated Dylan O'Brien, who is 26 years old, played the role of a character who is no older than 19 years old according to the book. While if he was opted for a younger actor, it would've caused uproar, it somewhat frustrated me. What O'Brien did prove is that he can act very well and Kaya Scoldelario has also turned herself around from her past few acting disasters. Overall, Wes Ball showed that he's serious about Hollywood and knows his way around a movie set. So far, this is the best film of the year in my book and I can't wait to see more movies not only from the actors who did so well in this movie but Wes Ball, too, as a director.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

When you raid a train, you don't know at what exact point you'll be stopping the train - so your friends can't hide behind the rocks just at that point.
When your raid a train, you don't plan to capture that enormous helicopter.
When you're in the helicopter, you don't stop shooting missiles. You don't land. You don't try to capture someone with a sniper rifle.
If you've captured the giant helicopter, you shoot your enemies.I haven't finished covering the major flaws in the opening scene yet.There are so many plot holes you wonder if there was a plot in the first place. There is so much discontinuity you wonder if someone has actually watched this film to check them. There is so much corniness only a true fan can handle. The dialogues are as empty as the characters' motivations.Why a 4? The Director of Photography did a great job. Even if the camera work didn't focus enough on the surroundings, the post-apocalyptic landscape was beautiful. And the special effects department also did a great job, just like costumes and make-up.A good-looking film missing the ingredients of a good film: an interesting script, good drama and developing characters.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
153,daviddevilliers54,Definitely Not Worth It For Closure To What Could've Been A Great Trilogy,2,11 May 2018,"I'm not going to lie, as someone who is very negative when it comes to young adult films, the first Maze Runner really surprised me as I was entertained all the way through. It had amazing characters, a great plot and it was visually fantastic. I was so ready for the sequel. Then when the sequel came out, I thought it was okay. Nowhere near as good as the first film but good enough. It ended with that cliffhanger that definitely left you hanging for the ending. That's when this came out...This film is extremely bad which really sucks because as someone who loves closure to trilogies, this really broke me. Trust me, closure is NOT worth it. It's best you left your mind wondering what happened afterwards by just assuming the good guys win and picturing your own story. It is a LOT better than what you're going to get. There is SO MANY things that are awful in this film. It is extremely long with so many cliches and unnatural dialogue. There is very hollow, shallow and unrealistic romance in here and so much more. The only good thing I can say from this film is that it is visually good but even THAT is not enough to redeem this horrible film. For many people, they will desperately want some closure and just for that, skip to the ending but even that's not worth it as it STILL leaves you hanging even though this has ended! Like I said, this film is not worth it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
154,gigitville,Surprisingly Enjoyable,6,26 February 2018,"So, I had clear expectations going into this movie. While I loved the first one, and the book series when I was younger, I knew that since the second film deviated from the book, the third one would too, and it would be decent. Not that great, not totally unbearable. Honestly though, most likely because my expectations were low, I enjoyed the film. 
The cons were it was too long and some parts could've been trimmed. Also, I wish they stuck to the books throughout Scorch Trials and Death Cure, including how the Cranks act. I know it's more theatrical to have them essentially zombies, but it was more interesting in the book as just people who had gone insane but could still sort of live for a while. In my opinion, anyway. I also wanted to see them truly go back to the maze instead of just Minho gong back in his nightmares, but Ki Hong Lee did a fantastic job in those scenes. 
The acting was great, the set design and effects were pretty great, and there were some genuinely good parts. Some genuinely tense and emotional parts, surprisingly. And up until the last twenty minutes, I liked it. However, the reason I didn't like the last twenty minutes was because of a different reason that gets me to cry every time because I love Newt and Thomas Brodie Sangster and having to see him act out page 250 and narrate his note for Thomas is totally brutal.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
155,pixfarina,A conclusion that is so crass my jaw dropped off.,4,18 January 2021,"Parts one and two of Maze Runner were entertaining and created a degree of mystery that was propelling this series towards a potentially interesting conclusion. That is what movies are supposed to do and Maze Runner was doing this well. All three films provide a good degree of tension, some decent acting and very well handled special effects. In short there is nothing wrong in terms of production values that is not balanced out by the all round quality of the film making. But..............the conclusion of Maze Runner is so morally cowardly and arrogantly crass that I was left scratching my head and wondering what sort of person though it was a good idea? The viewer gets to make that conclusion because those who made the movie probably never even stopped to consider what they were doing. So I will talk about that because it is important (and timely given the current pandemic that is sweeping the real world).At Maze Runners core is the idea that a select and very rare set of young protagonists are imbued with immunity from a pandemic called 'The Flare', a scourge so deadly that is scheduled to wipe out mankind. And that is a lot of mankind, everyone in fact, except those very few characters who are the stories protagonists. So the set up is these young people are fighting against a system that is trying to exploit them; exploit them to find out what they have that can save absolutely everyone else. The plot takes a little twist to say it is not exactly that, but that is just a plot device to keep the action running and away from any direction that might be thought provoking. So those doing the exploiting are looking for a cure that could help everyone. So what are the supposed heroes doing?What should emerge from all this is complex moral questions, existential angst and soul searching. But this is a juvenile movie about juvenile people written in a juvenile way, so the third installment of the Maze Runner series continues on where two left off, with 'heroic' children fighting and the 'mean and evil' adults, and nothing more. Even beyond the avoiding of complex issues and choices, it is a thoroughly absurd simplification.In the end all this movie involves is the fighting of battles and running about. And where does this all lead? Well that is the saddest part. In the end the supposed heroes, who have not stopped for a second to consider what self sacrifice is or might achieve, secure what they want, which is the exclusivity of their own survival. This small band, genetically immune to 'The Flare' virus, escape the people who are evil (but, would save mankind), and thus leave the rest of mankind (absolutely all of it!) behind to face certain death. At the end, When Thomas, the leader of this small unique band, looks over his shoulder towards his pursuers we are supposed to admire his beauty and celebrate his escape. But he may as well just flip his pursuers 'the bird', because that is what this film does to the audience.The moral of this tale is that sociopathic teens, handsome and physically highly admirable (good candidates for Hitler youth perhaps?), are right to throw mankind under a bus leaving these shallow monsters are to become the future of mankind. Oh dear god. Thus the entire plot of Maze Runner is rendered pointless unless one is willing to endorse a view that genetically superior human beings have the selfish moral right to exclude and replace those they chose to let die. It is that simple, that trite.Creatively the ultimate flaw of the series is its super arc story, one so big that the protagonists within are lost and exposed as unworthy. And in the end an audience who statistically would be a part of the human population that this brave band condemn to death, are supposed to applaud their survival (and it is theirs an no one body else). In short these survivors are not heroes, but anti-heroes, who are a friend to no one but themselves. It is a conclusion that could have been darkly Nietzschean if the film was in any way daring or intelligent. But I doubt that was ever the intention, so in the end it is just crass and stupid nonsense that just accidently stumbles into endorsing a Nietzschean world view that in the real world we generally labor every day to renounce.If the Maze Runner series deserves to be remembered for anything it is mainly because it is maybe first of a subsequent slew of high budget movies based on thin and badly thought out ideas. People ask will there be a Maze Runner 4, and I have to ask why would there be? If it deserves to be remembered for something else if perhaps because it delivers a triumph to a selfish philosophical standpoint that is so reprehensible that we introduced something called the Nuremburg codes to stop it coming to fruition again. And maybe it is an under current of unease among the audience who watched this that has seen Maze Runner fade from memory while other efforts (like Mocking Bird) became infinitely more celebrated.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
156,eliza_gaskell,The final in a Trilogy....really?,5,21 September 2018,"This movie is a typical young adult entertainment movie adaptation, much in the vein of The Hunger Games Series and the Divergent Series, where it is set in a post-apocalyptic future. It is however, a hell of a lot better than Twilight.The plot is actually the government aka WICKED searching for a cure, which turns the population into zombies, very smellier to the Resident Evil movies. BUT the subplot is Thomas and Co. searching for his buddy who is locked in a corporate city/lab, is the actual plot...go figure.There are some good acting and touching moments, like a lost love romance, questions of morally, losing friendships and loved one. What lets this movie down is that there is no emotional connection to the character to even care about them. It's like a soulless juggernaut. Maze Runner: The Death Cure is beautifully shot with great scenes, which you notice like in the church interrogation scene with Gally. The lighting is masterful and the acting is pretty good. Hopefully Dylan O'Brien would go onto greater roles in his character. There are glimpses of his acting ability but the role of Thomas is boring. Thomas never really grows as a character and his remains pretty much the same as he was in the first Maze Runner movie.Trivia note: Wes Ball directed all 3 Maze Runner trilogy movies, which is great because the movie is consistent in it's tone, action, feel and look. The production value is worth every dollar and topnotch action sequences.On a serious note, Dylan O'Brian (who played Thomas) was seriously injured when performing a stunt during the production of the movie, and he was hospitalized. It turned out the injury was life threatening and the whole production shut down for 2-3 months.Overall: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE? This movie is an extremely slow burner, which takes a while to get to the actual point, hence why the plot is stretched paper-thin. It is predictable with awful dialogue. By The way this movie is terrifically filled every movie cliché.MY WHAT THE MOMENT: ** SPOILER**: The beginning of the movie starts with Thomas and this friends hijacking a train car of teenagers who are immune to the Flare. They hitch a train car with wires from a plane they stole from WICKED. These wires are winched up to the belly of the plane. 
At the end of the movie, an injured Thomas and Teresa are at the top of the roof of a burning building. They can't go back and they can't go down, chaos is all around them, then like Bishop from Aliens, Thomas's friends show up with the stolen plane but instead hovering and opening the winch and lowing the cables to help Thomas and Teresa, they open the back doors....There is equipment in the plane like wires, rope, cargo netting etc. to help this rescued attempt. Those who seen the movie would know what I going on about.Would I recommend this movie? Yes whilst it is a lack lustre movie, it is better than the 50 Shades of Grey movie and it would be great to watch if you wanted to fall asleep within 15 minutes of watching this movie.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

The second one was a bit boring and this one offers a fitting finale, like the kind of season finale some series get.This doesn' mean this is a good movie. The main character is an idiot who thinks he can save the world and take on an entire army by himself. It's like he knows the bad guys always miss or wait too long when they fire their guns. Strange. This seems to happen in a lot of hollywood action movies. Luckily our heroes always hit the bonzai when they fire themselves. In a way that's also normal because they are teens who grew up without guns and the bad guys are a heavily armed and highly trained military. It's normal that the latter suck at shooting a gun.The story line itself is basicly action, problem, deus ex machina, action, problem, deus ex machina, etc. It's easy to write a story like this because it doesn't have to be clever or good.But hey, it's a teen movie and I should look at it this way. It's better than other, similar movies so yeah, there's that. It's well directed, pretty good acting and the action music's spot on.

The second film was nothing more than a zombie flick, but I'd invested the time in both films so I wasn't going to not watch the finale.Wish I hadn't bothered. It's 2 and a bit hours of generic science fiction, event after event with no real discernible plot. No twists, no big reveals, no ""oh my god"" moment, just a series of events. Nothing to make me feel sad that the trilogy is over.I would have given it 5, had it not been for the scene where they pick up a bunch of kids in a bus and drop them over the massive city wall. I nearly turned it off there and then.A huge deal is made over Newt, and honestly, I never felt engaged enough by Newt as a character or by Thomas Brodie-Sangster's acting that I was remotely upset by him dying (it was on the cards as soon as he got the virus) nor did I find the letter in the finale remotely touching.The whole is-Theresa-a-goodie-or-a-baddy plot line was dull, and killing her off at the end... ugh. Killing off a major character for the sake of it. It didn't add anything to the story except a slow motion shot of her falling into the fire.I'm honestly struggling to find anything positive to say.

Seems like everything's about teens and twenty-something's saving the world anyway. 
I was pleasantly surprised. So entertained, I went to theater to see the second movie, with leads to the final installment- Maze Runner: The Death Cure. Was I just as surprised?
Picture
Maze Runner: The Death Cure was just as good as the first book. It carried all the intrigue, suspense and action as the previous movies. There was no lag, there was no boredom and there was truly no hope for Thomas, for a while! The conclusion tot he series is about freedom, friends/family and a cure for what ailed the world. Movie three picked up where the second left off. Minho was taken and they had to get him back. In order to do that, they had to make a deal with a crazy ""Crank"", who wanted nothing but to go out, in a blaze of glory, for the cure to the ""Flare"" plague. It takes a great author to write a book series like this. It also takes some amazing screenwriters, directors, producers- the whole lot, for the FX and stunts in Maze Runner: TDC. Unlike other movie franchises, I never grew tired of it and now I'm thinking I may have to get the books after all. EVERYBODY was right! It was amazing and so worth the purchase. So check out Maze Runner: The Death Cure. If you haven't seen any of the movies, you should, but you don't have to in order to enjoy this one. It's an great movie. All of them.

181,werlingjakob,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure is an Okay End to an Okay Trilogy, Very Fan-Pleasing",6,6 April 2018,"When the person sitting next to you at a coffee shop starts up a conversation with you about dystopian movies. The Maze Runner series is probably not what comes first to mind. The now-completed movie trilogy has a history of mediocre box-office earnings and mixed reviews. It is just one of those series that a non-fan could probably enjoy, which is what I'm saying simplified. And the latest and last entry (probably) in the film series, The Death Cure, does not do anything unpredictable. Mostly because it wraps up the okay film trilogy in the most predictable way possible... by being okay. The acting in the movie is on-and-off, Dylan O'Brien and Aiden Gillan do good jobs portraying the characters of Thomas and Jansen, with O'Brien giving his character a tough edge and Gillan giving his character a very sadistic dark side. But other than that, the acting is very cheesy and melodramatic; probably because most of the characters are portrayed by very little-known actors. The action sequences in this movie are very crazy and over the top and destructive, which is how I like my action sequences sometimes. Mission: Impossible has nothing on this. Though the story is... well, a different story (I apologize for the pun), literally! The movie's story is pretty much completely different from the story in the book. It also throws in a lot of random events that were unnecessary. Though the opening sequence is pretty awesome. The music is very formulaic; there is really nothing to be said about the music. The set pieces are amazing though, The Last City is especially mind-blowing. It is amazing that a movie this little-known got such funding for it to make such good set pieces. The special effects are also pretty good too. Though there are still lots of things to complain about. At times the film feels really overly dramatic, almost like a Twilight movie. And then the filmmakers just HAD to cram in a useless, though very very small, love triangle between three of the characters. Some of The Death Cure's acting, its action sequences, its opening sequence, its set pieces, and its special effects prevent it from being a bad or horrible movie. Though its story, its music, most of its acting, its feel, and its character developement prevent it from being a good, great, or amazing movie. Which means that it is stuck at okay. Don't worry though, it will please fans. By a lot actually. Though it probably wouldn't satisfy any one else who isn't familiar already with the books or films.

183,Al-Jaeger,All I can say is: Thank God it's over,1,23 January 2018,Fun fact about this series: When filming for the Scorch Trials Dylan O'Brien stole from the Native American land they were filming on. Later he went on to laugh about it on TV and the studio had to apologise for him rather than he doing it himself. I believe this franchise was cursed from that day... because along with The Scorch Trials this movie sucked!The story it's telling? Lol. Stereotypical AU post-dystopian nonsense. Unnecessary parts to cause reactions rather than to move the plot along or build character. The main star's acting; Dylan O'Brien - it's mediocre at best. Not what it's hyped up to be.It's that of equal to a Transformers movie. Just turn off your brain and enjoy the mindless action.

185,filmexperienced,Lackluster end to a mediocre trilogy,4,18 January 2019,"Given it's troubled production history and considerable delay (by YA standards) between the second and final installements, one could be inclined to be lenient in any consideration of Maze Runner: TDC (as no one is calling it). Yet, whilst the Divergent series remains unfinished and our imaginations are free to soar to the (limited) possibilities as to how that could have ended, this franchise goes out with a whimper. An incomprehensible plot (go where to do what with who now?) with forgettable characters, who at no point feel in jeopardy, despite the bullet and explosion driven special effects chaos which litters the over-extended run time like brackets litter this review. Indeed, other than Will Poulter (stoic/bored) the pyrotechnics are perhaps the only bright spark in the dark post-apocalyptic world - which wastes both other actors (Kaya Scodelario, Walton Goggins!) and the time of talented individuals who contributed to the production design and the visual effects. The mysterious promise of the first movie is never exhumed from where the even worse Scorch Trials buried it, a missed opportunity for the screenwriters who fail in epic fashion to make you engage emotionally with the characters - meaning the climax to the movie also falls flat. In short, not as advertised a cure for death, rather a blandly lazy way to move yourself two hours and twenty-three minutes closer to it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I had to press pause to gather the strength to finish this movie. If you are looking for a continuation of the dystopy we saw in the first part, you should brace yourself because this part feels like watching Spy Kids. The CGI is quite bad and took me out of the ""immersion"" several times. Dialogues are short and nothing we haven't heard before. In the end I wanted them all to get caught and executed, actually I got annoyed that it was always ""halt, don't move""... instead of shooting first, questions later.

I did enjoy some of the action scenes. I do agree with some users that the intent to use weapons by the enemy was terrible. Clear shots for days and not pulling the trigger. Acting was pretty decent for the most part. Plenty of action but the plotholes were noticeable. The love story could have been portrayed better and the kiss was terrible. For that to be the last kiss they will ever have I would be giving it everything. Not a closed mouth peck and a bear hug.I definitely think that the maze runner was a great movie but I have to agree I'm not sure why we are still calling it that now. The last 2 movies were not bad as part of the series. I still had some laughs and some intense moments but I am watching it at home with a projector and surround sound with the subwoofer pumped up high. Definitely impacts movie pleasure.Anyways if your a fan of the series I would watch it. I'm sure you will enjoy it. I really can't see how this movie could be rated 1 star. Come on people.

204,mik_mik_90,Almost lost in the Maze,8,24 January 2018,"Though not nearly as perfect, I love the first Maze Runner movie. I was quite upset with the second one, The Scorch Trials. All those twists and alterations in that movie leave a bad taste at the back of my mouth, and I know that I am not the only one because after I saw that movie I saw some rants from other fans of the books on social media too. Also, the fact that it took a year to release this movie (Yes, I know that Dylan O'Brien had an accident during the shoot) kinda lose my momentum with the series a bit, I have to hurt my head to remember some names of characters and what have happened in previous movies. And their marketing department doesn't help much because it felt like their not promoting this movie hard enough. Nobody's talking about Maze Runner in here. Perhaps they just don't want to burn that much cash because they know the quality of their product? I don't know but we'll see in coming days how would The Death Cure performs at the box office.While I was walking into the cinema to find my seat, I was having this words play repeatedly inside my mind, ""please, don't suck"". But! I got to say that they've done a pretty decent job with this final installment. Though to be honest, I don't have high expectations for this movie after what have happened in The Scorch Trials. Though some scenes may be predictable, I still appreciate the effort that they did to pull it off. And base on the reaction of some audience in the theater, it seems to me that they were surprised when they saw some familiar faces pop up on the screen. Oh! and also there's a lot of explosions in this movie.Now in terms of characters, here are some that I really like in this movie. I think that Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) did a really good job in this movie, it made me realize how physically demanding this movie was and his accident made me appreciate the scenes even more. So thumbs up for that.I also like the portrayal of Teresa by Kaya Scodelario, too bad she's caught in the middle by Thomas and W*CKED but I really felt her genuine sincerity in finding the cure for the virus to save lives without any hidden agenda.Another man of science (or should I say a woman of science) that I really like is Doctor Ava Paige portrayed by Patricia Clarkson, her methods in finding the cure might be plain wicked but you'll see in her eyes that she's compassionate and that her intention is good despite the terrible acts they need/thought to do. I was kinda surprised with Rosa Salazar as Brenda in this movie. I thought she was forgettable in the Scorch Trials but she's quite badass in this one and I really like that. Good for her being cast as Alita, I'll be looking forward to seeing that movie. And is it just me or does Rosa looked like Kaya quite a bit?As for Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), I think that he really is the glue between the bonds of these Gladers and how his character affects the decision Thomas will have to make in this movie but of course, to those who read the books, you already knew it.As for Ki Hong Lee (Minho), I don't have problems with him when he's running or he's fighting bad guys, but when you just put him in a scene where he just sits, I just can't connect with his character on the emotional level. I don't know, perhaps his face acting is a bit flat for me. So I am not that invested with his character that much.Surprisingly though, I find Will Poulter's portrayal of Gally interesting. Poulter's really good at portraying this type of characters.And lastly, Aiden Gillen (Janson) helps elevate this movie being the bad guy. I wished his co-actor in Game of Thrones' Natalie Emmanuel (Harriet) and Braking Bads' Giancarlo Esposito (Jorge) have more screen time because they're such good actors as well. Overall, I think that this is still an enjoyable movie and for someone that read the books I find it satisfying. I got to give Wes Ball a credit for not entirely ruining such good source material and of course James Dashner. Go see it!",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
205,finraziel,"Starts out great, but then nose dives and drags on too long",4,27 January 2018,"I just watched a Maze Runner marathon, the first two followed by the final instalment. Loved the first one, but hadn't seen the second one yet. I have to say, I didn't think that was anywhere near as bad as it was made out to be.
The third one though? Oh boy... Well, it actually starts out really well! Good action and our heroes are able to make a fist against WCKD in a very satisfying way. Unfortunately, the film ends up dragging on seemingly forever. I feel like at least half an hour could have been cut to make it much better. The second half of the film keeps getting more and more boring.
The biggest problem is that several of the most important characters are completely unbelievable. Janson (Gillen's character) especially seems to make no sense at all. 
Then there is a nagging feeling that the whole thing is completely pointless and our 'heroes' are actually wrong! Now that could be very interesting if done right, but the movie is presented entirely as a young adult good guys vs bad guys film and the fact that they may be wrong is not explored at all. If they'd just done nothing, the world would probably have been a better place, but the movie still pretends that they 'won' and everything is fine now.
Also, the motivations behind why these kids were put in the maze in the first place are barely explored. It's implied that the pressure is needed to trigger their immunity to grow (why that would be so is beyond me), but most of the kids just sat in the Glade peacefully for years.
Instead of exploring those topics, the last half hour or so of the movie is spent watching characters melodramatically stare at each other while war rages around them, inevitably dying because they couldn't get over their teen angst long enough to actually save anyone (except Thomas, he has plot armor).
The film just left me feeling like I watched some dimwits that couldn't see the big picture and the survivors now sit on a beach pretending everything is okay (when most likely the infected will just catch up with them and they'll die because they're just sitting there in a couple of beach shacks)...",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

Things can be really traumatizing.Maybe the directors though Maze Runner is something people watch multiple times. Sadly NO. Least someone can do when they start a sequel is to move scenes in a way people who dont remember much about the prequels will understand.

The protagonists are undefeatable and the antagonists are 100% evil guys who will 100% lose, even if the protagonists are a bunch of children and their enemy is a high-tech corporation with seemingly infinite resources. Ending was straight out horrible. The story behind the movie had great potential, to which the first and, to a slightly lesser extent, the second movies lived up to. With misses here and there they managed to pull something out of it and make them entertaining to watch.

The entire movie was extremely predictable and just plain stupid. I don't know if it's accurate to the book and I haven't seen the other parts of the series, but the script was just ridiculous. The ending climax scene just had me shaking my head at how nonsensical it was (let's not bother to back up the hovercraft another foot or two for dramatic effect). And apparently no one knows how to perform basic first aid.. inside of a hospital? The cliche and overdone ""ha you missed.."" ""DID I?"" scene that I saw coming from a mile away. The evil bad man character that is so one-dimensional. Really it seemed like every single scene was a parody of every other teen movie because the script was so poor. And holy hell did they draw out the scenes that were meant to be ""sad"" but just fell completely flat.. one of the deaths stretched on for 10min even though his character was barely in the rest of the movie and had no importance. On the other end of the spectrum the movie killed off a main character for the most ridiculous reason that was entirely avoidable if the characters weren't complete idiots, and no one seemed to care about her pointless death.All in all it's just a mind-numbingly stupid teen zombie movie with a bunch of artificial action sequences stuffed in.

Of course Thomas sets out to penetrate the city, fight through zombies (yeah they are not but there are really no difference) and find Mihno. This is where it all goes downhill.

The team is still consistent of mostly young beautiful people, of different etnic looks and genders, yet a middle age man makes his way there too. The age groups are not that diversified in the team that lives outside the city amoung the main characters. This time we get to see how the group wants to free some that have been captured. They want the person free. They do a semi successful prison transport break, but they get the wrong individual, therfore the quest to break into the city sets off. We get to follow their way there. We get to see zoombies and the apocalypse feel is there. As usual it is with the element of mad scientist's and high tech & people clouded by greed. I found the film good when seeing it, but when trying to do a review I really don't see how. It is a prison break movie really, set in the fictive future of a dystopia. They tried to make it gender equal, but not age equal, even though there are ""older"" people, but the beautiful young people are many and in focus most of the time, compared to some middle age people. So who does this film attract? Maybe people that like Maze Runner type of films. People who like science fiction and dystopia that takes place on Earth. Well, see it, it kept me the edge the whole hours it ran. It most likely doesn't bore the audience, since the pace is rapid.

I hoped 'The Maze Runner' had more books so this amazing journey could go on. It's definitely one of the best movies based on young adult books. For example 'The Hunger Games' the first movie was great, i gave up after the second one, 'Divergent' the first movie was good, i gave up after the third one, but only watched it because it was a cheap marathon and i didn't watch the second one.

From sitting at the edge of my seat to feeling all the emotions one could have since following these characters for so long left be spellbinding.The acting was top notch, there was action non stop, the intensity was constantly there and so much more. I truly can't say enough how grateful I am to have known this series and having it all come to an end. It's both very bittersweet of a feeling and hard to see it go. But may it remain in our hearts and minds as the years go by and see that The Maze Runner truly finished with a well deserve and respectful ending. Thank you Wes Ball and James Dashner for making a story and film(s) come to life. I for one and truly grateful for the memories that it all brought me.

226,bubilica69,DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!,8,10 April 2018,"Everyone has the right to their own opinion. That is true.... But to evaluate this movie as standalone, away from past two, that is simply stupid. This movie, as a part of trilogy, is simply the best issue for past 5-6 years. 
I was a bit skeptical about the third installment of the ""Maze runner"" saga, because, in first place, starting the first movie it seemed to target teenage audience, as was probably right. And considering I had extremely low opinion on Twilight saga, I really thought I will see another lame teenage money grabber. 
If anyone bothered to watch any of my recent movie review, you could see that my thoughts of newest releases are bad, but this movie changed my mind about today's Hollywood.
It's is simple, logical conclusion of maze runner saga, but with much of action, drama, thriller elements, and, I have to say, almost unexpected end. 
When I reached the final 25 mins of the movie, I thought I was watching another conclusion in the stile of Matrix. But I have to assure anyone reading this, you couldn't expect better conclusion than this.
It still remains the fact that this movie is purposely mad for younger audience, and that is my grade a bit lower, because it IS a little naive. But it 's nothing like newest releases in that domain. With previous two releases (which I gave 7 and 5) makes great story, which should, by own means, be watched if You are in need for quality entertainment. 
For the first time in last 5-6 years I really can say that time spent is time spent well.
(I tried not to insert any spoilers, so this might be a bit lame).

I get it, it had to appeal to 15-18 yrs old audience, but sending that kind of message to teenagers is simply wrong.What's the message? ""Adults are wicked, let's kill em all and take matters in our own hands"". There is no other way to interpret it.It does not matter there were not enough people to repopulate (you need at least 10000 to be safe from degeneration and inbreeding), it does not matter they had basically nothing on that island to keep them alive - no doctors, no medicine, no drinking water, no food, no real shelters, and more important, nothing to keep science and culture alive.The false hope they try to infuse in the ending ""this will be a good home"" is the cherry on the top. Anyone with a bit of common sense realize in a couple of generations the island will be populated by a bunch of starving people, with a lifespan of about 40 years, barely capable to talk - basically the ""rational"" version of the infected. But hey! Who am I to judge their version about a good home, right?Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. Unless you are a 15-18 years teenager and have family issues. In that case you will love it. But if your brain is more developed that the average rabbit, skip it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

But during this 3rd episode, I didn't fill any. It looks like ""Blade Runner"" (for the aesthetic of the futuristic city) would merge into ""World War Z"",... during the whole movie we are asking ourselves the reason and connection to the original maze. Characters seemed to me less charismatic than in the 1st episode.
The movie becomes sometimes ultra-violent for nothing. There are parts of the movie which are just like fillers, to make it longer.
Apart from the cascade from the introduction sequence (where even O'Brien was seriously hurted and the film had its finalization postposned from at least 6 months), and a small surprise stunt with a ""bus"", I almost fell asleep during the whole movie.

The damage done by those fuel barrels striking the gates, that was shown soon after the explosion, seemed like as if it was blow from inside out with a lot of strategically placed plastic explosives of high explosive value. It was so perfectly torn from inside out, that showing a truck rushing into the huge gate meant to stop almost everything rushing into it, probably 10 meter thick gates of steel and what not, was way too far away from even damaging the gates.After this event, which in time showed and proved to be the determiner of the end of the story, just ruined everything that came afterwards with insensible choices. Newt's infection was rushed unrealistically as well, in a comparison to many examples we had from previous parts, where people had enough time, but the lame drama build was necessary for the creators to implement here...heck, even Teresa said that Newt still had time, she is professional and knows the estimated time. Assuming that only few days passed(around 1-3 maybe) since Newt showed the infection up to the moment of breaking in.and out of the city. He had barely on his wrist, and in 1-3 days it shouldn't have progressed that fast, since he had it for long time, and it progressed pretty much slowly until the moment he revealed, since then it unrealistically progressed through his body up to his head.He should have been saved, he wasn't required to be dead, he had enough time claimed by professional. Same for the city itself, that gate was supposed to hold off such dumb explosions, but no, lets make unrealistic explosion that breaks not just gates, but some part of the wall as well...and thus resulted in a good city that shouldn't be destroyed, into destroyed. The suspension could have been made without blowing up gate. Otherwise it doesn't make sense afterwards.And the ending when the helicopter was saving both Teresa and Thomas, pilot said he can't get closer...not sure, I saw plenty of room where he could've gotten close to save them both, and in much faster time. Since those propulsion engines weren't taking air from below, but from above, the flames wouldn't be sucked in and damaged engines, so they could have saved the both easily.
Heck, everyone could have been saved, but noo, people just have to be stupid.Basically the score went down because of the gate being blown, it just created a chain of some illogical and unnecessary plot twists, or to some maybe even obvious plot twists.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

The first movie was different from we were use to see and have that mystery around the labyrint. The sequel present us to the ""post-apocalyptic earth"".

The first one was the most exciting, the second one somewhat and the third one from what I remember was zombie, zombie zombie... I was quite apprehensive about how they'd make it work in the movies...
But they did an amazing job! I wasn't expecting it at all, I couldn't see it in my head.
They captured the most memorable aspects of the book beautifully. I always pictured Newt as the most noble character from the book... That was portrayed beautifully in the final letter and the death scene.
The whole concept of Thomas being the cure was confusing enuf in the book... We are lead to believe that Thomas is the key but he'd have to be killed as the brain has to be harvested... Then again even if he was killed, there would be no cure...
But I kind of like the way it was adapted in the movie... I love how they emphasized the character of Thomas as the cure for a disease of the mind... Him being courageous, trust worthy, loyal, a good friend was depicted well in the movie.
And I have a newfound respect for this movie as compared to the first time I watched it when it came because I learnt that filming was delayed due to an accident.
I am so glad that they didn't replace the lead actor. I am so glad he came back to finish this even after the trauma.
I'll probably still watch this trilogy 10 years from now... It just wouldn't be the same if they'd left this incomplete or changed the lead.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

You know, I want to start with that I loved a lot of these movies, the idea's, the acting, scenery, action.But now I am lying in bed and I'm thinking and so much doesn't make any sense whatsoever that I have to write about it!Ok, they want to stimulate the primitive brain to get more ensymes. I get it. But why do they have to make a maze out of granite, 50 meters high for that? And where do the robot-spider-aliens come from? No explanation whatsoever.Why do they have to come from 100 meters under the ground? No logic there. Why didnt they found out about the cure in the blood from the beginning? Before they send him up in the maze? No answers there.It's just like someone smoked a few, came up with some great ideas and let the the story logic to someone who is 10 years old...But ok, you have to accept a lot of crazy ideas and go with it, because it is still a great movie, don't think about it to much and expect to get any good answers!And maybe you can experience this movie as one big metaphor, like a young adult looking at our world, our society and asking questions.

242,lissajoann,"Exactly what I expected, but not really.",6,15 May 2018,"First off, I have no sympathy/respect for anyone giving this movie a 1 because they didn't understand the plot - pick up a book. Also none for those who found it predictable. It's based on a book, of course it's predictable. Now for the movie...The Maze Runner Series is one of my absolute favorites (except The Kill Order - sorry, Mr. Dashner, hated that one). The first movie mostly follows the book, but somewhere from the end to the next movie, the screenwriters lost their way and completely rewrote this story. 
This installment, while a good movie, and better than the second installment, repeats the trend of deviating from the storyline. I like that they kept the ""who lives/who dies"" true to the book, even tho one of the deaths is as difficult to watch as it was to read in the books (it still hurts my heart every time I read it). 
If you just watch with the mindset that it's a ""good movie"" and that it's LOOSELY based on the books, you'll enjoy it a lot more. If they'd stayed closer to the storyline, they'd have gotten a higher rating from me.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
243,nathaliebazinga,"Dystopian heaven, Moral battles",10,26 January 2018,"While staying true to the book trilogy, Wes managed to produce a movie which will be interesting for any fan of dystopia and adventure. The only thing I would mention is that this movie certainly isn't for kids, and for people who were emotionally invested in these movies for the past three years, I suggest not watching if you're not mentally prepared for the sad moments. Now, I get that some people in the reviews were agitated that certain characters died in the movie, but since that is what happened in the books, it was inevitable. At least they didn't die without a fight. Actually, I thought the death scenes were beyond amazing and filmed perfectly! I know we all hoped it wouldn't happen but the story wouldn't be the same then, wouldn't it?Apart from the sad part of the story, from the beginning of the movie there was constant action. The scenery was also breathtaking and the investment and energy these actors have put into this movie is awesome. The fact that the main actor actually did the stunts himself, had a serious accident, yet returned back to finish the movie adds another layer of respect for this franchise.The Death Cure is a perfect concoction of action, adventure, heart and friendship. What is also important is the battle of the moral views on the world. Do we sacrifice these people in order to save everybody else, or do we let them go and leave it to the natural selection?Since many people here are very subjective and giving it 1/10, I will be subjective as well and give it 10/10 stars.

This movie felt very awkward, it's all about saving a friend, even though you lose more friends than you save, he doesn't seem to upset about it. Yay we save Minho, but Newt was better. Just saying then they got to the end and was like oh, we're haven't put in a love scenario yet, let's have her kiss him here. Then the whole 20 second starting scene where she could have got on the helicopter, but got lost in thomas's eyes or some stupid stuff.

249,jcosully,A weak ending to a so-so series,3,27 October 2018,"I really enjoyed the Maze Runner. I liked the Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. I did not like the Maze Runner: The Death Cure. The series has been continuously getting worse. The plots are less and less original, and the movies keep getting more boring. The main problem with these movies, is that they stray way too far from the source material. I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more if it had followed the path the book had, so I could get a visual of what was happening in the book. Instead, the movie goes in its own direction, which usually I don't mind, but if a movie goes in that direction, it has to be good. There really isn't much of a plot here, just a lot of mindless action and when that is stretched into 2 hours and 23 minutes, it becomes a total drag. The movie also doesn't make that much sense, bringing back characters that were killed, which doesn't make that much sense. They don't even explain how they came back, which was very unsatisfying. I also didn't like how there was barley any time spent showing cranks. Those were a major element of the books, and one of the most entertaining parts. In the movie there is only one short scene with them, which kind of wasted a huge enjoyment factor with removing them. Also, the movie is just so long, especially with such a threadbare plot. There are so many boring parts, and so many repetitive parts, which made the movie really bad. There were a couple good things though. The first one is that the visuals are pretty good. If the visuals weren't good, the movie could've been even worse. They are sufficient because they aren't an eyesore, and not distracting. The other good thing was that the fight and action scenes were really well put together. They were heart pounding and interesting to watch, with new elements thrown in. In short, Maze Runner: The Death Cure is just one really long fight scene without a big entertainment or enjoyment value.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

For some reason (sleep mainly), I'd missed most of the second film and it was a total blur.I was a little disappointed in the first film which simply ignored a massive plot point in the book (the psychic connection between the two main characters). As a result, there were a few scenes in film 1 where things failed to work. Unfortunately, this plot point turned out to be even more important in films 2 and 3, resulting in large portions of them not making any sense.The second film takes a few scenes from the middle of the second book but deletes all of the beginning and the end. Literally nothing in the second film makes sense and anything required to move the franchise on to the death cure is lost.This film isn't as good as the first but it's much better than the second because it tries to make at least some sense and tries to retconn the awful writing of the second.

261,daddylovesisaac,Good film...,8,1 March 2018,"I just could not wait until January 28 (despite coming out on the 26th, I'm with my dad on a Sunday) to see this movie since the day it was announced that it was rated 12A (I'm 13 years old). I planned to see it in IMAX 3D at Cineworld Leeds but unfortunately that didn't happen because I had the wrong coat on (it was age 9, it was my brother's) and we had to go back for mine (age 12). So we had no choice but to see it at Cineworld Bradford (the screens there are small) and it was just in 2D. Anyway I was still sort of looking forward to seeing it, it was like my 2nd most anticipated film of 2018 besides Avengers: Infinity War. I went to see it and it was fairly good. There were some good but sometimes memorable-for-being-stupid action scenes like the scene where Teresa rides a bus with children on it (to try and get away from shooters, I think) and suddenly stops the bus to police. After about half a minute she gets back into the bus and the bus gets pulled up by a crane for some unknown reason. At that moment you might think 'So dumb'. The children scream and the bus crashes down to the ground with the message: Out of Service. There is also some cut dialogue from the trailer, like when that woman says to Thomas, who is holding a gun: 'You can save your friends, or you can save us all'. Unfortunately in the film it is cut down to a dissapointing 'You can save us all'. There is also Newt saying 'Three years we spent, trying to break out. Now we're trying to break back in.' But it seems like the actor who played him said that 200 times to get the cut right, and eventually Fox gave up because in the film he's like: 'Three years we spent, trying to b-break behind walls. Now we're trying to b-break back in.' There is a bit of good zombie violence, it would have been better if the BBFC hadn't cut it just to achieve a 12A certificate. However, the main problem with this is how Newt and Teresa die. Tell me about it, you say? Well basically Newt dies when the explosions are happening on the street and everyone's running. Thomas, Newt and Min hao are sat down in an alley next to the street, and Thomas starts to realize that something's wrong with Newt and then he starts to turn into a zombie until he's at his final moments before he dies wailing: 'Tommie! Help!' and he's trying to bite Thomas but he can't control it because he's turning into a zombie. Thomas and Min hao are very sad but continue their journey. There's some more action including the 'You can save us all' part where Thomas puts his gun down and gets down on his knees until the woman is suddenly shot by an evil villain whom I nickname 'The Smiler' because he keeps doing these devilish smiles and he is very menacing. The film, however, ends with a bang. Teresa is on top of this crumbling building and Thomas gets in this helicopter and tries to pull Teresa on as it rolls away. However the building crumbles and Teresa falls as Thomas shouts 'Teresa! No!' accompanied by sad music. He wakes up back at his camp from the first movie as if it were all just a dream and Newt and Teresa are actually fine. However it is not as Thomas and all his campmates gather round a big campfire and remember everyone from The Last City and this man shouts 'Here's to the ones we lost and couldn't be here today' accompanied by the same sad music. Then Thomas reads this letter from Newt saying about how much he misses Thomas and being alive, and how he wants Thomas to look after everyone and thanks him for being his friend and ends the letter on a sad note. Dissapointing ending! If you ask me the only film that counts and should have been in this 'franchise' is the first Maze Runner film, 'The Maze Runner' where they all escape from the maze. The other two (The Scorch Trails and The Death Cure) are just about more action outside the maze. Especially not a third film about two great characters dying. One of the parts I particularly liked in this film, however, was when Teresa was speaking to a hardly-awake Min hao in this room. He just looked so tired out, and then he started shouting 'YOU'RE A TRADER! I'LL KILL YOU, YOU'RE A TRADER!'. Isaac's Parents Guide: Violence and emotional scenes. A man suddenly starts yelling at a woman. Zombie humans attack people in a tunnel. A man turns into a zombie, and dies. A child starts screaming because she is turning into a zombie. A woman falls down from a crumbling building. Many other violent scenes. Profanity like 'shit' 'prick' and a middle finger gesture. Some intense scenes with people turning into zombies and people dying because of the Flare. BBFC Rating: 12A (moderate violence, threat, language).",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

You have no clue what's going on in the first movie, the second one reveals some things, and this one, although being incredibly sad, was probably the most well acted and well crafted out off all three of them, and explained everything. This was a great way to end the trilogy. I think the people who rated this 5 or below didn't finish the movie. Because the ending was very powerful, I was both happy and sad.AND YES...this movie wasn't PERFECT. There were a couple scenes that didn't fit the story and felt unnecessary to the plot, but that didn't make me hate it in the slightest.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I was upset that from all possibilities they had with the maze, they barely even went into it and all it had was one type of monster. But it turned out to be just a setup for a bigger plot. What the first movie did well though was making me care about the characters. I wanted to see them survive through the sequel.The second movie I liked more. It was predictable, but rather enjoyable. I liked how they developed the story, liked the addition of new characters and new bonds. The late betrayal, the set up for a sequel, it all was done kind of well, made me want to see the next movie. Gave that one solid 7.Now the last movie, this one, yes, it was just as predictable as the second one and full of cliche, generic scenes and average acting, but it did well what it was supposed to do. It drew a nice conclusion to a pretty long story. It also played really well along those bonds that the characters have developed over three movies. I liked that. I also greatly enjoyed how the story developed and how it concluded. For that I give this movie an 8.It made watching two previous ones worth the time. Well done.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I see a lot of people thinking they're such intellectuals and unfairly rating this movie too low. Get off your high horses, these movies were made for teenagers anyway. That's something to keep in mind while watching these types of movies.People tend to like the first movies more (then get disappointed in the follow-ups), because they're usually just about the pure, raw survival, keeping the plot simple, and I get it, but there has to be a bigger picture why things happen in the first place or the movies wouldn't go anywhere. I liked the fact that in this movie they showed both sides of the situation. The Wicked wasn't portrayed as black and white as in the previous movies.Sure there were cliches and predictability as expected, but all in all this movie was fun to watch. All of the movies were a bit too long in my opinion. I also didn't really connect with the characters that much, because there wasn't a lot of meaninful dialogue, and we didn't really learn that much about the characters. Most of the new characters we got to know in the second movie were pretty much irrelevant in this one.Fun movie to watch if you enjoy dystopian adventures.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

275,baseballcrw,An Overall Mediocre Conclusion to the Franchise,5,29 June 2018,"I have a lot of respect for Wes Ball. Almost no other directors have stayed with a film series based on a young adult novel series the whole way through (Gary Ross left after the first 'Hunger Games', Neil Burger left after the first 'Divergent', etc.), and Ball certainly has a knack for directing sweeping action sequences. The problem for me is the overall script, but I'll get to that later. Dylan O'Brien overcame a life-threatening injury while working on this film, which shows his true commitment as an actor, and I have to say, he still gives the best performance and has the best character in this franchise. In fact, most of the cast does a great job with the material they're given, and they sell it the best that they can. Back to the script, though. About an hour and a half into the movie, it felt as if the inevitable conclusion was near. I was actually enjoying myself, despite the relatively repetitive nature of the story, and if it had ended where I though it would end, I may actually have given the movie a fresh review. However, the film then proceeds to go on for another hour, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if that damn repetitive nature of the script hadn't continued. I knew where every plot point was going, making the last half particularly boring for me. Although I do prefer this than to split the last film into two parts (that's a shot at you, other young adult franchises), I just can't help feeling like a good 20-30 minutes could have been trimmed off the second half of the film. If you are a fan of the franchise, this is pretty much in line with the previous two films. However, for the rest of us, I just found the runtime on this film to be much too long to warrant a positive review.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

282,mitchellbieds,The end is WCKD!!,9,25 January 2018,"For starters let me say that i loved the first two films. The first offered mystery and the second offered a bit of horror (more or less). I will admit though, the second is the weak link of the three, and the first being the best one (in my opinion), and The Death Cure delivers something that the last two didn't.....tons of action. From the opening scene to the last, the action basically never stops. Although some of the action sequences aren't emotion rich, they are still very entertaining. You will certainly never be bored. I do feel the plot was a bit thin, but that in no way makes this a bad movie, if anything it makes it easier to watch. I just feel a deeper, more complex plot would've added to the drama and action of the film. The actors portray their characters extremely well, especially Dylan, he can truly make the audience feel what he's feeling. Although character development was not a strong point in this film, i feel it didn't need to be. Because if you've seen the other two films, you already know how the characters are and how they feel towards other characters and what they believe is right and wrong. For me, the first two films provided the character development, this was just the ending. There are some very powerful and emotional scenes in this film especially towards the end (I, myself did tear up at one point), and the ending, i feel, was really satisfying. Im still trying to decide if they left it open for a fourth or if this really is the last one, if so, i wont mind at all. I do believe that fans of the books and the first two films will enjoy this film a bit more than just your average movie goer, but it does still deliver even if you're not interested in the whole story.All in all this is a great movie, it delivers on the action and the heart and even has a couple of slight twists and shocks. This was just a satisfying, brilliant and sad end to a terrific trilogy. The end was indeed WCKD!!",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
283,siddheshgarg,COMING-OF-AGE ACTION MOVIE FOR MAZE RUNNER FANS ONLY,4,6 February 2018,"The 3rd installment of T. S. Nowlin's Maze Runner series packs quite a punch with Patricia Clarkson's nearly expressive face. While the storyline is predictable, the live action pieces stitched together bears an uncanny resemblance to Steven Spielberg's Minority Report. While 20th Century Fox did its best to up the popularity factor by casting Lord Baelish from Game of Thrones, there is hardly any espionage or mind games being notably played. 
 Though the crux doesn't deviate from the James Dashner's book The Death Cure, it is quite referential to the current times of unrest between superpowered countries today. The film does take you on a quest of Gladers trying to get inside the Last City and barring a few action sequences, there isn't much other to experience.

The majority of the acting was very convincing and heartfelt, the production values we're quite good, and for the most part the filmmaking made sense. The plot however, did not. As I understand it the movies were a significant departure from the books, and in the first two movies the results seemed adequate as the story appeared to be going somewhere. This resolution proved that this was not the case. The theme of Thomas saving everyone he could was immensly undercut by him allowing an entire city full of people to be brutally murdered, all non immune ""cranks"" to die of the disease that he was the cure for, and basically abandoning the world to go live in Hawaii with his friends. While I understand an attempt was made to imply that the cure he represented would actually just be sold to the highest bidder, this wasn't made clear and didn't justify allowing a whole city to be destroyed. In the end WCKD was correct and their methods succeeded in producing a cure, everyone who isn't already immune dies so it didn't matter, and the characters show no guilt or remorse for letting the rest of the world completely collapse. None of this served a moral lesson for the viewer, as is typical of good dystopian fiction, and it was devoid of any satisfying closure other than the plot ending. The principal goal of the heroes journey was to save Minho, which was successful, but it comes at such cost to the moral fiber of the protagonist that it is questionable who wins the plot.Everything else was passable in the movie, but the story was just so poorly constructed that the hard work of the rest of the production team was wasted.

318,thevincercode,The best conclusion fans of the series could ever have,7,29 January 2018,"There is something about endings that I loathe. The feeling is doubled when I actually know how and when it ends. With The Death Cure as the conclusion to The Maze Runner series, that is exactly what I felt - as if there's a countdown that licks every second in front of my face.If you haven't watched the two previous films then there is no chance that you'd get a grasp of what's happening. They didn't waste time to get catch you up, or remind you if you forget, that the movie was set in a world that is a wasteland and that the whole human race is at the brink of extinction because of a virus called The Flare.In a nutshell, as you may remember from The Scorch Trials, Thomas and the Gladers successfully escaped the Maze but ended up being followed by WCKD at the last part with aide of Teresa. We saw that Minho and most of the remaining teens were taken on a plane by armed men that work for WCKD. They were supposed to be transported to the Last City to be experimented for a Flare cure.This is where The Death Cure continues the story. The film opens with an action packed sequence where Thomas, Minho, and Frypan, along with Jorge and Brenda, try to hijack the train that will bring Minho and the others to WCKD's headquarters in the Last City. Determined to start over again without WCKD's experimenting, the group would face off several challenges along the way including running away with Cranks and getting inside the heavily guarded wall of the Last City. Along the way, they would find and lost friends; a long lost Glader thought to be dead that would end up helping them and people dear to them, respectively. What lies ahead will either bring the immunes a new hope or the only cure the dying world will get: death.I don't know about those unfamiliar with the films but fans of the book and series will get the conclusion they deserved. The producers have been generous enough to give fans 142 minutes for an ending after a 28-month hold.Wes Ball's approach and direction with the three films has evidently developed over the years. However, there is something missing about his vision for The Maze Runner Saga that I am realizing just now - attachment with audience. The films weren't strong enough to claw on the viewers. Character buildup wasn't really given focus on the entire series which makes it hard to form attachments if one haven't already established on the previous films.I like how T.S. Nowlin's screenplay closely followed the book but this last one was good but not good enough to leave a lasting impact even to a fan like me. This is not to say that I hate the film because personally think this is better than The Scorch Trials in many ways and Scorch was already an okay film for me. It's like a parting gift from a lover you won't even beg to stay.Nevertheless, there are many good things I liked about the film that I want to point out.First, the quirky dialogue. I liked how they sprinkled quirky lines on some critical parts of the film to serve as a comic relief. My personal favorite was Minho's ""Is this real?"" comment.Second, the production design and VFX. Props to the team for such good production design complemented with impressive visual effects. (However, I'm not quite satisfied with the sound design during intense scenes because it did not complement the intensity of the visuals.)Third, the good sequences. Although I have to admit that there were parts during the film that I zoned out because of the slow pacing on certain parts, they made several good sequences to compensate: the opening salvo with dangerous stunts on a moving train; the tunnel full of Cranks sequence; a bus full of teens suspended in the air by a crane. My favorite, though, was that emotional Tommy and Newt sequence that I knew was coming. The way they executed that sequence gave justice to that monumental part of the story.Fourth, the Acting. Dylan O'Brien has really matured as an actor. You can see that he's grown out of that goofy acting he's known for in Teen Wolf and that's what I quickly noticed at the beginning. Kaya Scodelario wasn't given much highlight this time, making her a mere eye candy on the background. Sangster and Lee were good actors giving life to such a good support team. Four years with this series made these actors grow with their character. Rosa Salazar was such a surprise to me. She pulled off her character very well and it's no surprise if she'll get roles on action films in the future.Fifth and what really got into me, the farewell letter at the end. I feel like that letter was the best send off they could give the fans. I mean, man I was thankful I got a VIP couch all on my own while I try to wipe my tears. That was a good cookie, I must say.Over all, The Death Cure was such an emotional action film fitting for an end to The Maze Runner series.P. S. could there be a TV series in stored in the future? James Dashner seems to be teasing on his tweet, though.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
319,whats_up_doc-59971,"Terrible script, no character development, big yawn",4,14 October 2021,"The first movie in the trilogy is good. It holds the element of surprise which can't be carried onto the sequels. The scorch trials was enjoyable. Death Cure (ironically named, as there doesn't end up being a cure for death) is 10 steps backward from the first film.They've done well with the CGI and backdrop, but beyond that it's incredibly dull.Perhaps the biggest flaw is the complete lack of character development. Thomas continues with the same repetitive, 'I'll save everyone no matter what and kill a bunch of people in the process' narrative. So much so that he's all about saving Teresa, who is willing to throw him under the bus at almost every opportunity. Teresa herself is one of the most dull characters to come to screen. No emotion, no range, just boring mouth half gaping stares the entire film. Absolutely nothing happens to redeem her villainess character. There's no chemistry between her and Thomas. Thomas' obsession with her can't be rationalised in any way as they simply haven't spent time together throughout 3 entire films, because she keeps back flipping to WKD.The movie doesn't need a romantic element at all in my opinion, but if you're throwing one in there, for gods sake make it believable.I wouldn't watch this movie agains, but I'd happily watch the first film from time to time.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

It's like any other film, where the main characters are still safe and sound at the end. 
Sure, the special effects were good, but the plot could have been better. It was so predictable. I really thought that I could have a little higher expectation for the third part, but it disappointed me.
The character Teresa was really unnecessary and annoying. She didn't appealed to me from the beginning on. Otherwise, the film could have been worse and because of that I would say it was ""Ok"".",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

323,davidbenrivera,Death Cure,7,10 March 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure was a decent ending to the Maze Runner trilogy. Movie starts right where it left off in the 2nd movie.

324,angiemas-82693,"Jaw-dropping, heart-wrenching",10,19 August 2018,"This movie is the most epic and fitting conclusion to a dystopian future story. Every part of the book that sucked was out, including the forced and unnecessary romance, which was replaced by the bromance. This movie is all about the characters that you're already emotionally invested in. You can't expect to be mesmerized by it if you haven't seen the previous ones. It's like complaining there is no character introduction in Avengers Infinity War. Thomas goes to WCKD for Minho and Newt chooses to stick with his friends until the very end and go down fighting instead of isolating himself from humanity. The characters are what create the pain, the hope, the heartbreak and the chemistry among the cast members is evident in the chemistry among the characters, which intensifies the pain the loss and the heartbreak. Especially the heartbreak. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about.Next, the ""bad guys"". I love how this franchise justifies the actions of WCKD and I love their portrayal as scientists dedicated to finding a cure, not as the ultimate psychopaths, except of course Littlefing-ehh I meant Janson. Ava Paige and Teresa are in fact grey zone characters who think they're the heroes in their own stories. That adds to the desparation and regret Thomas feels when he asks whether he could have saved his best friend. Even Janson the Douche at some point says that Thomas was born being the cure, he didn't fight for it and probably doesn't deserve it- which is not true, but undeniably justifiable. That's what I call realistic characters. Not everything is black and white, people. Finally, the plot and the action scenes, which are both exceptional. The action scenes aren't random, they're fast-paced and an integral part of the storyline. Combined with the amazing music, they keep you at the edge of your seat every second. The plot, in my not-so-humble opinion was better that the book's. Fast-paced as well, did the characters justice, made sense and led to this epic conclusion we've all been waiting for. There's nothing better that a final movie that does the franchise justice, and Maze Runner: The Death Cure manages to do just that. It broke my heart, it made me sob uncontrollably, it made me feel the loss, the danger, and the pain. And that's how I can tell it succeded.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
325,narothbo,Always coincidence.,1,29 January 2018,"The early started of the movie, they try to cut the train for help people inside the train but why their team waiting behind the rock at the same place when the rain stop from the head train? Another car keep escape from the helicopter that try to shoot them. When the helicopter stop and walk into the trap. How they can guess it stop and those people walk into the trap? They are genius. At night time near the beach they stay they open the light, just turn off immediately when they hear those people come. Why those airplane cannot notice the light. This movie still keep 2 hours and half cos of Ming Hoo but that is fine as he has many fans. 
Thomas and his friends go to help Ming Hoo and accidentally met the zombies and his friends with another car come to help. Can it be? Even when they come from the shelter in quietly but still those guys come follow them. Logic? They found the city, they try to get in. Lucky he met that ghost face guy and advise him to go inside it. That is great but why they dont let those people that wanna go inside go into the city? And the end why they destroy this city? Cos of jealousy people inside the city? Destroy for what? They are racist. There are many buildings but they can find her through objective lens. They are lucky that go inside the room and try to escape and downside has a pool. They are so lucky again. When the bus try to escape and block my police, that place is the same where the hug waiting. That bus is good quality as the front steel can carry one bus with many people inside it but unlucky it almost broke and lucky again they fall close to the ground. I was wondering why thomas keep saving his fri who is already zombie? He just know what is zombie today or know he has medicine to treat his friend? He spend around 5mn for this useless part. Say the true that Thomas can save the world cos of his blood. The part when they come to the roof top, he almost die because of fire but helicopter come to save him but not that girl? She wanna die by herself or people on helicopter dont want to save her? It is so close and not much different about distance and it should be lady first. Not him.

I hadn't planned to review it, but something caught my eye. While Thomas hesitates to break into WCKD's compound because of his love interest, Newt insists for Min Ho. It struck me that Newt is in love with Min Ho, and that is beautiful. Of course, this is just a pet hypothesis, but each of these character's loyalty is as strong as the others. Disagree if you like, but it gives the scene where Newt loses his temper with Thomas all new meaning. Then he reveals he is a crank to distract Thomas from his real feelings. Watch it.

And first thing I noticed is that during this film they finally reacted fast when they needed to run or act fast. It was a big relief. I kinda liked the pacing and how they created the idea of fleeing with this boat.
But, of course we still needed Minho. At the start I was all against WCKD and was pro saving Minho. However, Teresa, who is btw an otiose character and only serving for plot, started saving lives by using Minho. This made me reconsider if it was really necessary. And I liked it. But after that they just threw it away. It got really cheesy and expected. There were some good scenes but mostly it was too made up. The convenience was so big that the emotional scenes weren't compelling anymore. But I know the plot is mainly fixed so I am not too critical about this.
However, the scenes felt really unrealistic but got carried by the decent to good performances of the cast. And there were still some really good scenes. For instance when Minho was hallucinating and the final scene.Overall, I think it was ok but not good. 6/10.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

It didnt follow the book completly but the main scenes were there. The third book is really good but there are som sci-fi things in it hat i wouldnt want in the movie cause it would simply be too weird. I think Wess did a really good job making the movie more ""realistic"" than the book without ruining the plot. i actually liked some of the scenes from the movie better than the books version. The deaths were more meaningful and emotional than the book made them especially the last death. (you know who). The action was really well made, The actors (espeically Dylan) did a really good job, and the plot was overall good. There was also some good character-developments. i was also more sattisfied with the movieendning than the book. it gave more closure. i definitly recommend watching the first two before watching this one to get a relation to the characters and a better understanding of the plot.

361,arvinjanasis,"Please, Tommy. Please",9,26 January 2018,"Maze Runner debuted in the film industry a little over 3 years ago which was followed by its sequel The Scorch Trials released last 2015 and now almost three years later, the astonishing conclusion to the series is here, The Death Cure.If you have watched both fist 2 films and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this as well. Maze Runner has the action, the story, mystery and the thriller while The Scorch Trials gave us the suspense with more action, The Death Cure is the complete package! For those who have read the book, I daresay that the story isn't that much as same as the book but the story stands for itself. Though the story may lack some plots and twists, overall, this is an entertaining film and a remarkable finish to the trilogy! The film started with intense action of rescue which then continues till the end of the film and has not failed me to be amazed each and every second of the movie. This film adds drama and inspiration but as a whole it delivers what every fan could ask for: the return of Gally, Minho reunited with Thomas, Newt's destiny and the cure itself. What makes me like this film more is the fact that it has shown the importance of friendship and this (with all honesty) is the very first film that made me teared up in a movie theater. The scene of Newt's death till the end with his letter to Thomas crowns all scenes of the trilogy and I must say that this is the best YA trilogy yet (well The Hunger Games is the best series though). This is also (for me) the best in the trilogy. To be fair, I have also noticed some connections between this film and Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 like (a character who looks like Voldemort; Thomas tries sneaks to leave the team in order to find Minho who then stopped by Newt and Frypan which mirrors the scene of Harry leaving before the wedding; an unexpected help from Gally which then mirrors the unexpected help from Neville; an unlikely trio of Thomas, Newt and Minho and some other details) but nevertheless, it's still a great film!As for the film score, it still as great as the first two but I have to say that the final scene's background music(starting from Newt's death) were the bests! Overall, I would rate The Death Cure 9/10 which is by far my highest rating from the trilogy. A film full of surprises, action, thriller, drama, suspense, (some comedy) and basically a very entertaining movie from start to finish! The Death Cure is a must see film of 2018 and surely is one of my very best film experience to date!",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

366,jessye-33097,Tense Action In The Sacrifice Of Life And Unexpected End,8,13 May 2019,"The Maze Runner is a science fiction film based on a novel by James Dashner. The first film tells the world that is infected with a virus and an organization called WICKED that becomes greedy by creating and conducting experiments on a group of humans placed in a labyrinth.The maze runner has three series. The first is Maze Runner (2014), Maze Runner: Scorch Trials (2015) and the last Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018). For this review, I will discuss Maze Runner: Death Cure (2018). The reason I reviewed this film, because this film is highly recommended for fans of action films that like adrenaline. But If you haven't watched the two previous films then there is no possibility that you will understand what happened. So I suggest that you should watch the two previous films so you can be coherent and understand the story.At the beginning of the scene, the action section was started in the arid area and was on the verge of extinction due to the Flare virus. they will attack the WICKED train leading to the Last City to save Ki Hong Li (Minho). In rescue effort it has been described that it will often describe the actions of the attack because the wicked sought more stringent safeguards since the escape of Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) at Maze Runner: Scorch Trials. However, Minho's rescue failed and to save Minho they had to go to the Last City where they would face many obstacles such as having to go through a tunnel full of Cranks (humans who become zombies after being infected with the Flare virus). In this section it refers to adrenaline because it is almost impossible not to pass through the tunnel.Finally they reached the limit of Last City which was outside the wall. To cross the wall, Thomas was assisted by Gally who was thought to have died from the Flare virus. they finally crossed the wall and meeting Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) was a woman who had been loved by Thomas but had betrayed and allied with WICKED as a researcher.On the part after passing the boundary wall of The Last City, the one I like most about this film is because it addresses unusual and struggling actions. With acting Thomas who is full of inspiration and playing a character who is full of courage matches the storyline. Also supported by the same actor Newt who plays someone infected with the flare virus very well and Aidan Gillen (Janson) as an antagonist wants to use the vaccine for his own recovery. from this part it was quite furious and annoyed at Jason's character. And Teresa's good character brought her role, and her acting tried to find the vaccine even though she had to lie to join WICKED and what I like most when rescue missions are structured and have good cooperation. supported by sophisticated transportation equipment such as fighter planes that come unexpectedly to save the bus that holds children ""prisonersthe point at the end of The Death Cure is a relief and ends happily even though there is a sad part of being peaceful",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I can not for the life in me understand all the 1's and 2's this film has received. A 4, maybe, if the less good elements really disturbed you and the good elements did nothing. And I'm not even remotely in the target demographic. Don't expect deep philosophising, don't expect a mibdbending plot.

What happened there? The promised to made it up in part 3. Things will come together and meet the book story line but when will that happen?? This third one is jsut for the kicks.

393,sarah-beck72,"A good movie, if you have an open mind",7,9 August 2018,"First, I will state that this movie is almost nothing like the book. However, if you can look past that (after all, which movies these days are not vastly different from their literary inspirations?) this was a really good movie.The action scenes were packed and interesting to watch, and the slower scenes did a good job of keeping the movie grounded and developing the characters. Some of the actions scenes did strain credulity, but we don't watch a movie or read a book to experience reality. We watch a movie to escape reality, and that is what this movie does. It gives you an escape from real life, while still holding enough reality to make the characters and their actions relatable.There were definitely some plot holes and questions that really should have been answered, that needed to be answered. For example, why did the immunes have to be put through such horrific ""trials"" in order for a cure to be found? Why did Thomas not realize that his blood could save Newt as it had done with Brenda, or that it could at least give Newt a little bit more time? But as with all movies, you can't answer every question unless you want a movie that is four hours long. It also isn't realistic to get all of the answers sometimes. How often are we left questioning things in our own lives? Sometimes things happen without us knowing the reasons why.I also feel like the actors did a really good job at portraying their characters in a realistic way. Dylan O'Brien makes Thomas so real, and you truly feel that he wants nothing more in life than to save his friends and keep them safe. Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Newt, is the reliable right-hand man who follows Thomas' lead but questions him at times to bring him back to earth. And Will Poulter gives a great performance and makes Gally feel like he is still essentially the same character from the first movie, a good guy who did bad things because he was scared for his friends, and now he wants to make amends for what he's done.Some people will hate this movie because it doesn't wrap everything up in a nice little bow, or because it does not follow the book religiously. But keeping in mind that this is a movie trilogy based on a book series intended to be read by TEENAGERS, I think that this movie delivered exactly what it promised. A movie about teenagers meant for teenagers, who don't always do things the same way that adults would, nor do they look at circumstances, reasons, or questions in the same way either. It gives a unique perspective of an imaginary situation and guesses what a group of teenagers would do if faced with those circumstances, and I think that they did a pretty good job of delivering an answer.Overall, this was a really good movie when you look at it as being there purely for entertainment. And isn't that all that a movie is meant to be anyway?",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

395,TTdood45,Not Maze Runner: The Not Zombie Cure,2,16 April 2018,"This is my first review on IMDb and maybe my last but I would just like to selfishly join in on the fun of kicking the dead horse.
Just to be clear I haven't read the books nor am I usually a fan of the subgenre of ""dystopian future saved by young people overthrowing tyrannical rulers"".
I watched the first 2 movies back to back the same day and watched the third the day after. Needless to say the second and third movies are actual trash while the first has it's merits. 
The first Maze Runner worked well enough because it only provided enough information to the audience required as well ASKING QUESTIONS. As soon as the series devolved into ""evil big company is putting kids in a maze for literally no reason so they can find a cure for a zombie virus"" it turned into something a middle schooler got a B- on. That's really sad considering I even got tiny feelings of ""Cube"", a cult classic of sci-fi death maze movies, during the first Maze Runner.With that preface out of the way how about I list off some fun little plot holes and inconsitencies that I could find within The Death Cure with some tying back to the first 2 movies. I'll try and go in order of appearance.1: 6 months supposedly has passed since the ending of Scorch Trials and start of Death Cure but for some reason WCKD is only just now transporting Minho and others from some unknown location to their headquarters.
2: The plane they hijack is alone and lands for no reason when they corner Jorge and Brenda instead of just shooting them.
3: Thomas is dead set on saving Minho, who he doesn't even know for sure is alive, and barely gives notice to Aris or the other people he could be saving. Also Aris and the rest make no apperances besides the first 15 minutes and ending.
4: Minho is being tortured in a simulation, which he doesn't realize is fake for some reason, which begs the question why WCKD wasted massive amounts of time and resources building a huge maze when they displayed and admitted the simulation works. This also begs the question of why they wouldn't just treat the immune people very nicely so they would have no reason to care if they are being tested.
5: Thomas, Fry and Newt drive slowly through a tunnel they are highly suspecting is full of zombies when they could easily have driven faster to avoid them.
6: All other cities have been reduced to rubble but Jorge upon seeing the walls says they are new implying the city was still shining and fine before they raised the walls. If it wasn't shining and fine this implies enough people had resources to rebuild a ruined city to modern comfort.
7: Thomas and other tagged people aren't trackable by that tag until it is convenient for the plot.
8: Gally survived the ending of the first Maze Runner somehow even though he was infected and punctured through the lungs with a spear. This implies people arrived very shortly after Thomas and the others were flown away, removed the spear, performed surgery, and have been giving him serum for a minimum of 6 months. Gally may also be a cure considering a girl later in the movie was only infected for 3 weeks and still turned into a zombie even after serum injection. Nobody turned him over to WCKD for any profit when he was clearly a test subject. This is where I would have left the theatre.
9: Thomas never considered that his blood was a cure 6 months after Brenda was treated because he is a moron. WCKD was apparently also full of complete morons to not realize Thomas was a cure before the events of the first Maze Runner.
10: Gally was correct in that they did not need Teresa to enter WCKD HQ as they only needed her thumbprint. They could have done what he suggested and cut it off and saved themselves large issues while also maintaining her hostage. Thomas stopped him because he still had feelings for her even though she was the direct reason for Minho's capture as well as the deaths of many others.
11: Gally, Thomas and Newt suddenly have WCKD security uniforms supposedly because Teresa acquired them to use but they still insist on bringing her along as well as stupidly removing their masks at one point.
12: They raid the cell block but do not arm the immunes with the weapons of the guards they just took out as well as leaving Gally to retrieve the serum when Newt could have immediately used it upon acquisition. They also do not simply use the helicopter they have to extract the immunes under the pretense of guarded evacuation.
13: Thomas and Newt have the opportunity to incapacitate or kill Janson while alone in the elevator but simply avoid suspicion even though it backfires. Teresa also locks them in later although she could have easily stated Thomas and Newt were in the elevator leading to their capture faster with less incident.
14: Gally leaves to find Thomas and Newt but is revealed to have just been outside the building later.
15: Thomas, Newt and Minho lock themselves in a room with a lock that should not exist, survive a jump from at least 5 stories into a pool they do not know the depth of with no injuries as well as Janson or the soldiers deciding not to shoot them when they have clear shots from a vantage point.
16: The bus full of immunes driven by Brenda somehow makes it to exactly where it needs to be without being stopped as well as not falling soon after being lifted.
17: Brenda and Fry return to the outcast hideout only to sit and do nothing even though the entire city is exploding in the distance.
18: The outcasts destroy the entire city even though they wanted in and it does not benefit them in almost any way. They also could have entered the walls the same way Thomas, Gally and Newt entered earlier but were too stupid to do so.
19: The helicopter Jorge flies in does not get shot down although there is no indication it isn't WCKD controlled. A scene of a different helicopter being shot down is shown later to confirm this could happen.
20: Newt turns into a zombie even though outcasts clearly had access to serum they could have taken with them in case Newt started to turn. He also had the opportunity to disarm himself before turning but did not for no reason.
21: Janson shoots Dr. Paige even though she would be a valuable scientist regardless of affiliation due to her knowledge on the virus. Also the bullet does not pass through her into Thomas.
22: Janson has no qualms about killing either Teresa or Thomas even though they are both now very valuable to his plan of vaccine monopoly. They also do not threaten him with this fact
23: The glass on the zombie enclosement does not shatter when missiles hammer the building but shatters on it's own when an injured Thomas hits it with a microscope.
24: Thomas kisses Teresa and empathizes with her even though she was the direct reason many people were killed as well as Minho's capture.
25: Teresa could have made the jump to the helicopter as she was not injured like Thomas. The argument about the helicopter not getting closer is somewhat defensible due to the massive heat updraft that would surround the building as well as wind splash off the roof possibly disrupting flight stabilization.
26: Thomas carves Teresa's name on the rock although it would quickly be defaced as a portion of the people who died are also carved on the rock.
27: Thomas is the potential cure for a zombie virus that has destroyed almost all of humanity but is now isolated with no evidence shown people have the knowledge to create a cure from his blood.PHEW, and that's just the stuff I could find easily. One of the few positive things to come out of this movie is how NOT to write things. The only reason I gave it a 2/10 is because of how nice some of the effects and sets are even though sadly they are in a trash movie.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
396,baicu91,Enjoyable even if you're not a fan of the series,6,23 January 2018,"You still can watch this, a lot of fast paced action and the story seems solid.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
397,dalton-roslyn,"No action masterpiece, but a film with a heart",8,18 January 2018,"In the young adult movie genre it is rare to find a film that properly explores the grey between 'good' and evil'. The Death Cure does this, and does it beautifully. 
This movie may not have the best paced plot, or the most logical action/escape scenes, but it has a heart. It doesn't follow a group of heroes who set out to save the world; it follows a group of friends who just want to rescue one of their own, and are willing to put themselves at risk to do it. 
The main strength of the Death Cure in comparison to the other instalments is its ability to articulate the moral question at the heart of the whole series: Is it right to sacrifice your humanity in order to save lives? The series provides no clear answer, instead allowing the audience to empathise with both the protagonists' and antagonists' motives. Everyone (except maybe Janson) was just doing what they thought to be right. The scenes towards the end of the film, however, do highlight how disenfranchisement, caused as a result of WKCD's actions, can halt any progress and bring about destruction all the faster (a theme perhaps more relevant to the present day than 'the government is evil, let's take it down' i.e. The Hunger Games). 
Overall the film stays relatively true to the main themes of the novel, with only minor plot adjustments, and is an enjoyable and thought provoking watch. The ending scene is particularly powerful and brought many people in the cinema to tears.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

431,mariacabral-28388,Enjoyable action movie :),7,23 January 2018,"Firstly, I do not think the ""Death Cure"" does follow the stereotype of a teenage basic movie, in which probably a all romance between Thomas and Teresa would happen during the entire saga. Actually, the film creates a strong story meaning of friendship between this entire group that started as strangers that had to learn how to trust eachother. It's not just like any other teenager movie, like the hunger games or the divergent in which this kids are destined to compete and kill eachother. In this movie though, this group of young people fight and look to find a solution (by not torturing teenagers) for a possible real life situation (apocalypse) and a serious problem that the world is dealing with in that moment. Secondly, I understand the point that you think Dylan O'Brien acting is mediocre, however, for an actor who has never been to an acting school, I think he has developed and progressed alot ever since his first role in Teen Wolf. So don't just criticize his acting abilities, for not expressing well, because his role has a very complex persona to interpret (and never forget...he is still learning).",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
432,authorsandysmythe,One of the best YA movies out there,9,24 January 2018,"The Death Cure has gotten a lot of online and offline buzz due to the grave accident Dylan O'Brien was in. For a long time, there was a question mark as to what would happen to this movie. Most importantly, what really happened on that set to cause Dylan's accident and how badly injured he really was, got a lot of people speculating about it. Often indecently, impolitely so, mostly in press interviews.
Fortunately, the actor came out of it, albeit not completely unscathed, as he has been suffering from anxiety ever since and probably must have been doubting his whole career en life challenges at some point. You would for a lot less than that. How he ultimately overcame his fears, is stunning in its own right and deserves a lot of credit.
Whereas many of us would have pulled out of the acting business and just forget about doing anything dangerous, this man actually came back doing in the front of a camera by doing an intense action movie (last year's American Assassin), followed not by a safe romcom, but by completing the movie which changed his life: The Death Cure.
Where Assassin was an R-rated movie with a lot of hand-to-hand combat that must have been physically gruelling at times, The Death Cure can be considered an action-packed movie focusing on stunts, thrilling scenes and some physical fights. It is not that though that makes The Death Cure exciting or different than other movies. It is in fact a combination of things that makes it fun and tense at the same time.
To recap the story: In the first two movies of the series, Thomas and his friends are kept as prisoners inside a huge maze with at first seemingly no way out. When Thomas does lead a small group to freedom, even though at great cost, they discover that they have not really escaped, but were still prisoners of a company called WCKD. The bad guys (but are they really?) have vowed to find a cure to save the world from a fatal disease called The Flare, caused by the sun (basically, the world is screwed). The teenagers trapped in several mazes and later being kept together at WCKD, are immunes whose blood might hold the key to a cure. By testing them in the maze, they are bound to find a solution to the disease. In other words: if you have to choose between a bunch of kids or saving the rest of the world, what would you do?
One of their own, Teresa, feels she needs to help WCKD and betrays her friends, leading to the capture of a bunch of them, including their friend Minho. Thomas then vows to bring them all back.
Cue movie 3, where Thomas is determined to do as he vowed in the previous movie. The movie starts exciting immediately with a lengthy save-the-kids action-packed scene (the one where Dylan got hurt, so for his fans, this must be a bit odd to watch), organized by Thomas and what is left over of his band of brothers. Their attempts fail however, but lead to a place called The Last City, where Minho is kept. The story leads there, to a fancy city with huge walls surrounding it, as if it can protect them against the outside world, where people are still getting sick and are living in poverty.
While Teresa is struggling to find the ultimate cure, Thomas and his gang find a way into the city and do whatever it takes to save Minho. But of course, as it should be, things don't go as easily as they should.
The interesting thing about this story is not whether they get Minho out. That has sort of already been revealed in the trailler and the previews that were all over the internet. The interesting thing is the dilemma that Teresa and WCKD are dealing with: Save the world by sacrificing a large number of kids, was that ultimately worth it all? 
And what about Thomas, his friend Newt and the rest of them: If they are able to save humankind by sacrificing themselves, would they do it?
Death Cure isn't about the action, even though that is pretty cool at times (the bus scene is amazingly well done and funny at the same time). It is about the emotions that are so vividly present.
You can tell that the actors have really put their hearts and souls into this final chapter. Their group scenes and face-to-face scenes are every bit as tense and emotional as they should be. Some people can tell their story through their eyes. These actors can do that. Certain scenes were done with hardly any words but shown through slight gestures, movement or tears.
Dylan O'Brien, what a relief to have this man back. He has been a solid actor since the day he started on a little MTV-show called Teen Wolf, where he stood out from the first episode as the funny sidekick, later on turning quite serious and even evil. During that particular season, he again spoke only with his eyes, showing the good side and bad side of him with a gaze.
Thomas is a completely different character. Sometimes, you have wonder if this is truly played by the same actor, just by the way that the man creates little gestures and tweaks the character's personality. Dylan O'Brien as an actor has grown quite a bit. This is one of his best acting, if not the best, even though what he did on American Assassin (again, those eyes!). The man is only twenty-six and one of the best young talents out there. Let's hope Hollywood is paying attention.
Thomas Brodie-Sangster: An actor who has been a favorite of mine since he played that young, charming yet sad kid in Love, Actually. He stood out in an ensemble movie just by being so adorable. Already, at such a young age, he could act like the best of them. Add to that many great parts, Game of Thrones jumps to mind and here he is today. As Newt, Thomas Brodie-Sangster has portrayed a character that evolved quite a bit from the first movie up until now. In the second one, I personally felt he lacked some good juicy stuff to work with. In this one, he gets plenty of that. Certain scenes where Newt is interacting with Thomas, are intense and chilling. 
Kaya Scoledario is a fine young actress who has been able to work on fun and good movies. Her character Teresa wasn't explored that much in the first two movies, but in this one, the reasoning and motivations behind her decision, are explored and make a lot of sense.
The other actors have done a great job overall too, with ensemble scenes and solid performances. 
The Death Cure is long, but that serves its purpose. You don't get a storyline cut in two parts (Hunger Games or Divergent anyone?) and you get a fullfilling, emotional ending that fitted the story. It is over and done, with no sequels or prequels or whatever.
Wes Ball, director in all three, did an amazing job. Kudos to him for sticking with the movie too after their unfortunate beginning and a stunt gone wrong. Kudos to Dylan O'Brien that they kept this sequence in the movie as a sign that yes, you can overcome what life throws at you and come out so much stronger on the other side.
Go see it, you won't regret it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

437,ivanherrejon,A Predictable meh,1,28 January 2018,"The first movie to this trilogy had an interesting gimmick: a dynamic maze filled with dangerous creatures. When this is removed, you take away the most interesting part of the movie. That is why the sequel performed so poorly in the box office. The second movie could be summarized as a bunch of bland characters walking on a desert. This third and final film is better than its predecessor, but that is not saying much.The plot boils down to a group of characters rescuing one of the friends, Minho, of the protagonist, Thomas, while some people work on the cure for a virus. The virus is of course as unoriginal as possible (it turns the infected into the stereotypical zombie). The plan to save Minho is ridiculous, it consists of putting him and other people immune to the virus in a bus, lift it with a crane from the inside of the city and drop it outside of the walls that border it. Of course, the bumpers must have been incredibly strong since they remain attached to the bus when it is lifted by the crane, plus the immune kids must also be invisible because none of them die or are hurt when the bus falls.I must say I have a couple of questions. Why do mainstream movies have to end with ""epic"" explosions? Why are the main characters always being shot at when they are running, but they are asked nicely to calm down and to surrender when they have nowhere to go until a deus ex machina appears? Why does the bad guy, the one trained to kill people, who has an army at his command armed to the teeth, playing catch up with a bunch of teenagers for 30 min? If the first five times when he almost caught them were not exciting, do you think the next twenty will be? Are we supposed to care about Teresa's death? Didn't the movie spend 2/3 of its time painting her in a bad light? You know, the untrustworthy chick? Where is the character arc? Where is the plot twist? The suspense?Apart from the weak story, the acting is mediocre, and the directing was full of problems too. Instead of the action being fluid, it is shot by sections making it look clumsy and awkward. For example, there is a scene where one of the good guys throws a grenade, but instead of being thrown and it exploding, there a shot of it being thrown, a show of it shown where it lands, a zoom in of the faces of the bad guys looking at each other worried because it is going to explode, it exploding from a different angle, and a shot of the good guys celebrating. This type of editing removes the fluidity of a shot and disconnects you from it. I could go on and one, but I think I made my point.However, if you liked the first and, specially, if you liked the second movie, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this one too!",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

440,dgstewart,"beyond fantasy, simply absurd",1,4 February 2018,"Maze Runner: The Death Cure has strong special effects and many action scenes, but the lack of internal coherence makes it painful to watch. The film is full of absurdities from its first moments. To name only a few, an aerial gunship can't hit or disable a pickup truck, and a Glader somehow gets into cockpit of the operating enemy gunship without the pilot noticing until she points a gun at the pilot. The WCKD are painfully stupid one-dimensional dummies. Their troopers seem unable to hit anything with high-powered weapons. Later, WCKD Troopers with automatic weapons surrounding a bus with vehicles on all sides can't stop it. The Gladers quickly kill numerous WCKD troopers but there are numerous scenes where WCKD has opportunity to kill the Gladers but want them expect them to put their hands up and play nicely until they can overpower and escape. Over and over, Gladers virtually can't be hit or stopped where WCKD are totally incapable. These absurdities dispense of any suspense regarding how the film will turn out. Aiden Gillen, who was an intriguing character in GoT, here is reduced to a kind of Elmer Fudd-like villian, bumblingly stupid and incompetent beyond belief. It's a disgraceful script for a talented actor.The Gladers seemed to have no more ethics or morals than WCKD, and probably less. They had no qualms about killing and no concern for the larger society beyond their group of friends, whereas the WCKD doctor and researchers seemed to genuinely want to reverse the virus and help the citizenry to the extent possible.The hubris of this film's marathon length 2 hours 22 minutes made the series of absurdities excruciating, and it never got better. Whereas good sci-fi and fantasy films have enough internal consistency to engage the viewer, Maze Runner: The Death Cure had so many internal contradictions and problems that I was never able to suspend my disbelief long enough to find any enjoyment.If you aren't a dedicated longtime fan of the series, skip this one.

445,simonegauchinha,"Good movie, but so far to the first one",6,2 March 2018,"The movie ""Maze Runner: The Death Cure"", directed by Wess Ball, is part of a trilogy and presents a new phase. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) discovered the CRUEL plans and, with his friends, they destroyed the rich and protected city made just for a few people. Unfortunately, Teresa (Kaya Scadelaria), the love of his life, died following the end of the city. On this war time, they could save Minho (Ki Hong Lee), but Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) dies. The movie finished in an island, infection free, and suggests the story will continue.
The profile of the trilogy is going down. The first movie, ""The Maze Runner"", have been a good science fiction action movie. It has been the tenth most watched movie in 2014. The second movie, ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"", was terrible, it was such a bad copy of zumbis series/movies, with just 54% of public acceptance. Finally, the third movie got 69% of public acceptance and it is too far from the profile of the first one. The last Maze Runner reminds me of movies for theenager audience.

Third one.. wowI expected an ending. I did not get an ending!THE WHOLE THING WAS USELESS! All this time they tried to find a cure when they FINALLY do nothing happens with it.Why the hell did they blew up the whole city?! There was literally no point of doing so! Didn't they want to get in to be safe?! Why the hell did they destroy it?!?!Teresa could made the jump..And it ends with them being on an island and that's it?? What about all the other survivors? What about the cure?! Such a bad ending! I had high expectations..6/10 just because of the love for the franchise.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

It's hard to enjoy any movie with such high expectations, well nowadays anyway. With so many negative reviews I wasn't sure whether to go ahead with the movie, but with such low expectations, it wasn't that bad!

Minho : aaaaaa aaaaaa ( chain rattling)
Thomas: yep, this is minho, lift it up bois
*at the base, opening the container*
Thomas: where tf is minho? I thought he was with you guys?
The guy that i already forgot the name: He WAS there. (violin screeching and then the scene ends.)Question: How tf did minho got out of that container, he was chained and looks weak alright? and also why would he bail out of the container? (assuming its possible and there's a reason to it, which they didnt explain) there's a few more plot holes/unreasonable scenes that i remember, but this one is the most bizzare to me, oh boy what a sequel.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

From the first 5 min of the movie, the very start, you already know it's gonna be bad, and i liked the first maze runner, and sorta enjoyed the second one.
So why is it that bad ?
Every god damn action is far fetched and obvious, there's no surprise, it feels like it's written by a child...
From the awful enemy's aim that kindly avoid hurting the main cast because they're not allowed to perturb the story-line, to the cliche turn of even, every action leave a bitter taste. 
The story main story might be great, but the detail are poorly written, which makes every scene difficult to believe in, and for that reason, it takes a lot of determination or stupidity to finish that movie.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

456,trentk-04777,For Maze Runner fans,6,12 April 2018,"MR fans should definitely take a look. Others beware. Its a franchise film, the third of its series and derives its plot from teenager book series. The movie itself is well done (maybe the music is a bit underwhelming and generic) and keeps up with any teenie movie of this decade. This of course does not mean it is Oscar material, as you would think people expected to - judging from all those idiotic comments in here.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

It was not boring at all. It did not drag as a lot of people are saying. There were a few scenes that seemed a bit dumb but apart from that, the film In my opinion was brilliant...but sad :(",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
459,hhong-95655,Predictable film with stupid ending,1,15 April 2018,"I mean if you planned to have such cliche and predictable film like this, at least can you keep some more characters alive? I watch this film mostly because of Newt and why the hell he had to die? Not including that the cheesy love story between Thomas and Terresa makes me want to close my eye and vomit. Oh, and let me add up, why they are so stupid that they have to take a whole movie to relize Thomas'serum can cure the flares? Why, just why?",Maze Runner - The Death Cure
460,objectninezerofive,Better meditate than watch this.,1,16 April 2018,"Movie starts with the train scene, where few kids overpower brute ninja force with few handguns, no kids die and they get to steal the train and that futuristic plane. And from there everything goes downhill. There's like 3 of them and they are trying to infiltrate the main town where their friend is held captured. Result - all city is destroyed, like 3.000.000 ninjas are dead, meanwhile there are only 2 ""good guys"" dead. 1. Newt that the main character stabs himself, instead of running away and getting a serum to bring him back to health, he decided to stay and fight his buddy and stabs him in result. 2.That girl Rachel, was it? well it was sort of her own fault, she basically didnt want to get in the chopper. Badly written, badly executed, no twists, no turn, only illogical turn of events that you can sort of predict already from the get go. Seriously if this is based of the book, I don't see how or why it was a best selling novel, I rather go read Hillary Clintons memorandum.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

465,clarebis-68607,What books?,2,27 August 2018,"I have just finished watching all three films in the Maze Runner series.
 Did the maker of the films take the three books and just burn them and make his own movie up. Nothing important in the books were in the movies. Telepathy? Roof? Cranks village? Brenda? The list is endless. The first film was the closest to the book until the end but I'm presuming the budget wouldn't let the real escape from the maze happen.
I'm surprised anyone watching the films would understand the relationships and nuances between characters if they hadn't read the books. Or understand what the hell is going on to be honest.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

I was holding back my pee for close to 30 minutes and the movie just refuse to end. I gave up before the movie ends and peed for a solid 1 minute. I couldn't understand why is it so hard for the movie to end and basically Thomas is just running back and forth to make sure everyone is dead before the movie can finally come to near end.,Maze Runner - The Death Cure

472,sarahbuxton-01227,Enjoyable,8,2 March 2019,"I actually really enjoyed this. It's not meant to be literary, it's a film adaptation of a YA fantasy book series. They didn't make a faithful adaptation of any of the books but I think this one had better acting, special effects and had good general cinematography. One can't deny that it's a very well-shot film. Yes, it's full of tropes and it's not mind-blowingly original, but it does what it sets out to do and I enjoyed it.",Maze Runner - The Death Cure

This movie did not meet that expectation. As a lover of books, and a lover of movies, I understand that there are sacrifices that movie makers have to make in order to ensure the best movie possible. The movie makers made far too many sacrifices, and it's ratings are the consequences.

I found from the 1st movie to Scorch Trials to Death Cure is just entertaining. Sure the characters and backstory and plots aren't perfect, but what is? They all give a glimpse of what ""could be"" in this world after an apocalyptic plague and the battle between the haves and have nots. People are overly critical with reviews as if this franchise was meant to be a masterpiece of filmmaking.

They know nothing that Minho has the strongest cure, They just know that Minho is their friend. Just it? After the y destroy wckd do they have a plan? hmm
