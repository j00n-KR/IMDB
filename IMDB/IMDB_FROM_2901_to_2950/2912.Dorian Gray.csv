0,Leofwine_draca,"Looks nice, goes on a bit",4,7 January 2012,"DORIAN GRAY suffers from the same problems as other recent adaptations of Victorian-era novels (I'm thinking the 2011 BBC dramatisation of GREAT EXPECTATIONS): it looks great, but in the screenwriters's attempts to present relevant themes and concerns to modern day viewers, it loses something in the execution. The result is more often than not a production in which the actors look like they're playing dress up while there's no real heart involved.I've never read The Picture of Dorian Gray, but the central conceit – about a man whose portrait ages but not himself – is a great one. This adaptation is ho-hum, and that's because we don't care about any of the characters involved. The anti-hero Gray is played by Ben Barnes, who was fine as the square-jawed youthful hero of PRINCE CASPIAN but who really struggles to find depth in the part – any male model would have done the same job. Colin Firth is more interesting as an amoral creep, although he's largely detestable. The only character I really liked was Ben Chaplin, and he gets far too little screen time.There are other familiar faces in the cast – not least Fiona Shaw, Maryam d'Abo and Emilia Fox – but they get lost amid a welter of repetitive sex scenes designed to show the central character's descent into moral depravity. Unfortunately, with the overly long running time, the sex bits are repetitive in the extreme and the film goes nowhere with them. The movie is far too Hollywood friendly to ever be really shocking, and the late-in-the-day attempts to make amends just don't hold water (and neither does Rebecca Hall's anachronistic suffragette). It all ends in a CGI bubble of silliness, and you're left wishing for a proper adaptation with real bite.",Dorian Gray
1,SnoopyStyle,Nothing more than a painting,5,3 May 2014,"Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) is a young naive man arriving in Victorian London to live in his newly inherited mansion. Artist Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) befriends the newcomer. The cold-hearted Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) leads him astray especially from his love of sweet young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood). Basil paints him a portrait and he proclaims a deal for his soul.This is a cold stiff unimaginative movie. Ben Barnes is barely a pretty picture but he is certainly not much more. His character is not interesting enough to be compelling. The movie has no excitement and barely any tension. It limps along with as little drama as possible. Colin Firth plays with so much anger in his eyes that I find none of it appealing. If he was charming, then I could see the appeal. Everything in this movie moves at a tired pace. It is moderately watchable... barely. There are problems inherit in the story. Sibyl Vane comes and goes so quickly that their love feels superficial. The relationship doesn't have any time to develop. Rebecca Hall has slightly better chemistry as Emily Wotton. Her character is slightly more complex and most importantly has more time. Overall, the movie just isn't very interesting.",Dorian Gray
2,claudio_carvalho,Enjoyable Version of Oscar Wilde's Novel,8,30 April 2011,"After the death of his grandfather, the naive and pure Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes) returns to the Victorian London, where he befriends the talented painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) and the corrupt Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth). Basil paints Dorian's portrait and gives the beautiful painting to him while Henry corrupts his mind and soul telling that Dorian should seek pleasure in life. Dorian makes a deal with the devil, trading his soul to keep his beauty and youth, while his picture ages and displays the effects of his corrupt life. He leaves his fiancée Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood) that is pregnant and commits suicide and lives a self-destructive life of orgies and drugs. Dorian Gray travels abroad for many years and when he returns to London, his friends are aged while he is still the same. When Dorian meets Henry's daughter Emily Wotton (Rebecca Hall), they fall in love with each other and Dorian wants to revert his life. However it is too late for salvation and his soul that is trapped in the painting is doomed. ""Dorian Gray"" is an enjoyable version of Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. When I was a teenager, this novel was one of my favorites; I do not recall details of the book, but I liked this adaptation a lot that has a wonderful cinematography, great acting and a good screenplay. The relationship of Dorian and Sybil should be longer and better developed, but to adapt a novel to the screen, it is necessary to have the capability of being concise and the screenplay writer never disappoints. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Retrato de Dorian Gray"" (""The Picture of Dorian Gray"")",Dorian Gray
3,nogodnomasters,Don't worry. He's a doctor.,8,1 September 2017,"Dorian Gray arrives in London, young and beautiful, the desire of all the ladies. Young and innocent, he is taken under the wing of atheist Henry Wotton, who spares young Dorian no vice. A portrait becomes the embodiment of his body and soul aging, while he stays forever young.This is about the one zillionth remake of the Oscar Wilde story. I have found this one more enjoyable than most, but not as dark and sinister. I thought Ben Barnes did good in the title role.Guide: sex and nudity.",Dorian Gray
4,kosmasp,Prince Gray,6,29 November 2010,"Since I haven't seen the Narnia movies, I wasn't aware of Ben Barnes. Well not from those movies at least. But I had seen him in Stardust. And I really love that movie (wonder why it didn't do so well). But I can see that quite a few people took a disliking in him in this one. His performance is indeed very bland.And while I do think he just did what the director told him, there is not much charisma floating around. Well his ""mentor"" has some and Rebecca Hall does bring some too (late in the game), but you could be excused for feeling this is very cold indeed.Of course you could argue that the movie does not portray the character as he was intended in the novel. Think about the Sean Connery movie ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" though and you might think this is the best adaptation ever ... But seriously, this will not please hardcore fans of the original novel, but is a entertaining enough for one watch (and the cinematography is really great)",Dorian Gray
5,gavin6942,A Really Excellent Story Told With Force and Vision,7,16 June 2010,"I have never read the novel, I have never seen any of the movie versions... until now. And I must say I loved this one. It was engaging, powerful and sucked me in. Eternal life combined with a growing evil... that's a timeless story, which explains the many adaptations.There is something of a lesson to be learned here, but I'm not entirely sure what it is. Don't mess with the devil? Treat your friends fairly? Eternity has its blessings and its curses? I don't know. Those who are familiar with other eternal life stories (such as ""Tuck Everlasting"") know that there's always a drawback to what may seem like the best of ideas.",Dorian Gray
6,jboothmillard,The Picture of Dorian Gray,5,2 January 2012,"I had seen the original classic 1945 version with George Sanders, and I was intrigued that the famous Oscar Wilde story would be remade, and I knew there would be much darker things to come, from director Oliver Parker (Othello, An Ideal Husband, St. Trinian's). Basically, set in Victorian London, good looking and innocent Dorian Gray (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian's Ben Barnes) has inherited a new house in the city, and he is giving in to the pleasures of the wealthy lifestyle with charismatic but calculating Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth). The young man's artist friend Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) has finished painting his portrait, capturing his youth and beauty very well, and Dorian makes a slightly non serious pledge that he would give anything to stay as young as he is in the painting, even his soul. Soon he meets and falls for Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), he proposes marriage, but Lord Wotton convinces him having children is a bad idea and she drowns herself after hearing that he went to a brothel, and it is made worse finding out from his brother 'Jim' James (This Is England '86's Johnny Harris) that she was pregnant. Jim, her brother, tries to kill him before being taken by authorities, and even though Lord Wotton talks him round again that his life will get better, it doesn't, and he sees from his portrait that it is slowly decaying, and that his pledge has come true. He tells the artist Hallward this secret and is forced to kill him, dumping his body in the River Thames, but he sees a positive to this lifestyle where he can do anything to his body, and nothing will change. Many years later at a party all the guests are stunned to see that Dorian is still looking as youthful as ever, including Lord Wotton, and soon enough the young man gets very close to the Lord's suffragette daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), which her father is not best pleased with. Dorian seems genuinely intent on changing his ways and making a life with Emily, but then Jim returns wanting revenge for the death of Sibyl, and after trying to convince him he is not who he thinks, and a chase in the London Underground, Jim is killed being hit by a train. He is next planning to leave London with Emily, but Lord Wotton is very suspicious about why he has never aged, and looking back at old photographs he remembers the night he was there and he teased the young man about the selling soul concept, so he goes to the house to investigate. The two men have a confrontation in the attic, and the portrait is revealed as hideously decayed, and this turns into a fight where a lit lamp is smashed and the place catches fire, and when Lord Wotton locks the gate, Dorian decides to give into the destruction, his face decaying like in the portrait, and dying in the flames. We see in the final moments the Lord trying to get back into contact with daughter Emily, who was there witnessing her love die in the fire, and we also see that the Lord has the now youthful looking portrait of Dorian Gray. Also starring Emilia Fox as Lady Victoria Wotton, Caroline Goodall as Lady Radley, Fiona Shaw as Agatha and The Living Daylights's Maryam d'Abo as Gladys. Barnes gives a reasonably good moody performance in the title role, Firth is also lightly sinister in his part, the picture is seen as a living entity in this re-imagining, so there are special effects, and a more violent streak with blood and murder, it is a good enough period horror thriller drama. Worth watching!",Dorian Gray
7,rmax304823,Altogether More Sinister.,7,8 May 2011,"Ben Barnes is Dorian Gray, a beautiful, innocent, wealthy young man in Victorian England. Ben Chaplin is Basil Hallward, a friend, who paints his portrait and captures his inner goodness. Another friend is Colin Firth, as Lord Wotton, the cynical guy who keeps coming up with these Wildeian apothegms. In an earlier film he was played perfectly by George Sanders as the flippant, catty gay man he was. But Colin Firth is no simple cad. He's an agelast. His smile is that of a reptile.And although Hallward the artist warns Gray that rotten Wotton often says things he doesn't mean -- such as equating pleasure with happiness, and observing that even what seems like a tragedy is an experience one should undergo -- Gray takes his advice seriously.Gray pursues his pleasure regardless of its cost to others. He proposes to the pretty naif, Sybil Vane, impregnates her, then brushes her off. She does a nosedive into the river. Gray shakes this off and really gets on the hedonic treadmill.In the novel, this is the dullest part of the story. Wilde has Dorian Gray collecting overly ornate art, mooning over moonstones, caressing fabrics, and other michigas. Well, after all, this IS Victorian England, and Wilde couldn't very well write about the stuff we see here on the screen. Gray smokes dope, smooches with women in low places, draws blood (and maybe drinks it), seduces Hallward, and engages in other naughty bits of business.After acquiring a devilish reputation, he travels abroad for years, picking his nose and smoking in public and Lord only knows what lesser sins he's committing. Yet, when he returns he glows with youth just as he always has. Meanwhile that portrait of Gray's early self, secure in the attic, has turned into a pustulating horror.I doubt that this kind of story could have been so successful after Sigmund Freud and the discovery of the unconscious. Neither could ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" These are literary adumbrations of all those buried and unacknowledged libidinous impulses. That's what the portrait represents, of course. And of course we still lie to ourselves and each other -- beginning with ""How are you today?"" -- but not so dramatically.It's impossible not to grin when George Sanders comes up with a line like, ""The only way to conquer temptation is to yield to it,"" but this is a far darker version of the tale, taken quite seriously. You won't laugh when Gray dreams he is breaking the neck of Wotton's now fully grown and quite attractive daughter. When Wotton finds out they've been seeing one another, he doesn't laugh either.It's a very different take on the story from what most people are used to, but it's very well done. By the way, that word, ""agelast"" is pronounced ""AH-juh-list"" and means ""one who doesn't laugh."" It's very rare. I had a heck of a time finding it, and I hope everyone appreciates that effortful enterprise. If they don't, well -- I think I'll just brood for a while and then have to get over it.",Dorian Gray
8,ma-cortes,Haunting Oscar Wilde tale of a young man whose painting ages while he retains youth,6,25 January 2011,"Another adaptation of Wilde's renowned novel about a young man named Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes in the title role) whose portrait ages while he remains eternally youthful . It starts with Dorian who arrives in London to move into the mansion he has inherited . Almost immediately he falls under the influence of rake Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth), leading to a life of increasing vices, excesses and even violence . Through many years Gray stays as youthful visage , while a painting made by Basil (Ben Chaplin) grows old , reflecting his increasing perversion . Eventually the portrait, now secreted in his house, shows worms and a horrible vision . When his true love (Rebecca Hall), the Henry Wotton's daughter, ultimately enters his life he realises he must hide his secret at all costs, even killing . Dorian retains his young-looking as ever while his picture shows the corruption physical ravages of aging guarded in the attic and becomes almost hideous to behold.Modern-day take on of the known story by Oscar Wilde about an ageless, fresh-faced young man whose portrait reflects a life of debauchery and the ravages of time . This features Ben Barnes giving a nicely restrained acting at the beginning and excessive on the final. Good performance from Colin Firth as calculating and amoral Lord and gorgeous Rachel Hurd-Wood as unfortunate actress . Rebecca Hall is particularly appealing in the lead as Emily Wotton . Large support cast is frankly well as Maryam DÁbo , Emilia Fox, Fiona Shaw, Caroline Goodall among others . This rendition not nearly as good as the original classic and contains sex inserts throughout the movie . Although talky and sometimes slow moving , this movie nevertheless keeps you glued to the screen for its nearly two hours running time creating a foreboding sense of terror accompanied by a frightening musical score. Excellent and dark cinematography generating a chilling atmosphere made by the magnificent cameraman Roger Pratt . The motion picture is professionally directed by Oliver Parker , though with no originality . Other versions about this famous story are the following : The vintage version directed by Albert Lewin and starred by Hurd Hartfield , Angela Lansbury and George Sanders ; European version (74) by Massimo Dallamano with Helmut Berger , Maria Rohm ; and TV version by Glenn Jordan with Shane Briant and Nigel Davenport .",Dorian Gray
9,paul_haakonsen,A visually great presentation of a hollow story...,4,14 August 2017,"Being somewhat familiar with the essence and the story of Dorian Gray from literature, but not having actually read the book, then I must admit that I had some expectations for a movie such as this 2009 rendering of the story by director Oliver Parker. However, it is not before late in 2017 that I actually got around to find the time to sit down and watch the movie, despite having owned the DVD for years.I found the storytelling in the movie to be slow paced, actually too much so for my liking, and it was taking a serious toll on the enjoyment of the movie for me. It rambled on and on and took forever to go almost nowhere. And I ended up feeling rather bored and finding the storyline itself to be rather pointless.What made ""Dorian Gray"" bearable for me to watch was because they had gotten together a group of talented actors and actresses to perform in the movie. I am not familiar with the work of Ben Barnes, but he carried the movie quite well and was well cast for the lead role of Dorian Gray. But of course with names such as Ben Chaplin and Colin Firth as well, then the movie was secured some pretty solid acting performances.While the storyline was rather boring and slow paced, then the special effects department really put together some really nice visuals for the movie, and it was a real treat to watch that on the screen. I must admit that I was impressed with the CGI that they had in this movie, and that alone does count for a great deal in terms of making the movie somewhat watchable.I was disappointed with the overall result of this 2009 rendering of the Dorian Gray tale, but I stuck with the movie to the very end. I can't claim to have much of any interest in ever watching this movie again, then I am more inclined to pick up a physical copy of Oscar Wilde's classic and give that a read.",Dorian Gray
10,hitchcockthelegend,How Ominous!,5,30 October 2015,"Another adaptation of the Oscar Wilde story. Film is about Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), a man taken by the hedonism bug shown to him by Lord Wotton (Colin Firth). Upon having his portrait painted, Dorian comes to never age, but at what cost?Clearly not faithful to the literary source, Oliver Parker's film is an interesting misfire. As a sexy chiller it kinda works, having more in common with Hammer Films of the 70s than with Wilde's prose. Yet it often feels like style over substance, blood or nudity for blood and nudity's sake. While strong performances by Firth and late in the play by Rebecca Hall hold the attention, Barnes is bland and apart from being pretty, is unconvincing. Also irritating is Charlie Mole's musical score, it's good, it's just not in the right movie!The makers try to make a Gothic horror film from a Gothic horror novel, but never quite get to grips with the undercurrents of the story. Shame. 5/10",Dorian Gray
11,LeonLouisRicci,Only Recommendation is the Oscar Wilde Witicisms,5,7 August 2014,"Here's the Thing. It is Recommended that Before Watching this Film that is Worth a Watch, Read the Book. Or if You are a Movie Only kind of Person than View the 1945 Version. Only then is it Advisable to give this one a Go.Because the 1945 Film is Infinitely Better and the Book is, well, The Book. This Movie's Watchability is Only So Because of the Witticisms and Cynicisms of Oscar Wilde. Otherwise this Mediocre Movie is Nothing More than a Bad Version of a Good Hammer Film.It Relies on Nudity, Bloody Violence, and Modern Cinema Trickery to make this a Product of its Time and Persuade Current Audiences that this is Hip to the Jive of what Today's Moviegoers Expect. But it is done Without Much Style and is Rather Pedestrian.Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as His Mentor Henry are Adequate Both, But the Film is Forever Pushy with its Ridiculous CGI 3D Painting and Long Sex Scenes that Bury the Story with Excessive Overkill that is Frankly a Bit Boring. The Things that make the Classic Book and the Better Forties Version So Much More Rewarding is Charm and Style. This One has Precious Little of Both and is a Middle of the Road Exercise that should Only be Seen as a Curiosity after Experiencing the Aforementioned Book and or Movie.",Dorian Gray
12,dbborroughs,Good but the central role seems rather bland,6,14 January 2010,"British made version of Oscar Wilde's tale of the descent of Gray into depravity once his portrait is painted. Its an adult updating of the tale with sex and violence out front for all to see. For the most part its very well acted by the name cast that includes Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, Fiona Shaw and Maryam d'Abo. However in the title role of Dorian Gray, Ben Barnes, leaves little impression. He seems to have been cast not because of his acting ability, rather because he looks good. This isn't to say he's bad, he's not its just that he comes off as rather bland and not really compelling even when he's deep in the dark side. Worth a look if you run across it, but its not really something to go out of your way to find.",Dorian Gray
13,grantss,Great adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel,9,30 July 2016,"Set in Victorian London, a wealthy, free-wheeling young man, Dorian Gray (played by Ben Barnes) yearns for eternal youth. He achieves this by making a deal with the devil. However, a painting reveals the cost of this pact.Great adaptation of the Oscar Wilde novel. Excellent plot, as you would expect. Edgy, dark direction, with great CGI and settings.Great performances from Ben Barnes, Colin Firth and Ben Chaplin. Colin Firth is particularly good, delivering all the quotable Wilde-isms with perfect timing and cynicism.

14,neil-476,Adequate without being especially thrilling,6,16 September 2009,"Ben Barnes, best known as Prince Caspian, plays Oscar Wilde's picture-hiding protagonist. Barnes' key attribute is that he is a beautiful young man, which means that he is eminently suitable as the subject of a movie about someone who retains his good looks while his portrait accumulates the visual evidence of the life of debauchery he leads. As it happens, Barnes gives a performance which is adequate, if low key - one feels that he is never quite whole-hearted about succumbing to the sins of the flesh, and he really needs to be.Colin Firth plays Lord Henry Wootton, Gray's mentor in degeneracy, with a languid cynicism.In truth, this movie is essentially a Hammer horror for the noughties, with a much larger budget and some decent production values. It is moderately faithful to the spirit of Wilde's original if not the letter, and entertains well enough.",Dorian Gray
15,AlsExGal,Update is more of a horror film than the 1940's original,5,17 September 2020,"Updated version of Oscar Wilde's story geared to modern sensibilities that would perhaps appeal especially to horror genre enthusiasts.. . It seemed more or less conventional period piece for awhile but about 40 minutes in, an event occurred that nearly killed the whole thing for me. But the acting was so good I stayed.The blood, gore, and sex had to be endured, but thankfully these and other lurid elements were dished out in fairly short segments. The portrait did not merely become besmirched with the increasing decadence of the eponymous anti-hero, it exuded vermin that fell writhing to the floor, to name one example. Purists might want to take on a pass on this but if they like good acting they might reconsider. Ben Barnes (Dorian Gray) appears almost callow at the outset but that perhaps to reflect his early innocence. But he loses that rather quickly and becomes perfectly believable with an appearance Oscar would have approved of.Ben Chaplin (Basil Hallward) very good. The epigrams are often thought of as breezy, mirthful witticisms, delivered perhaps with hauteur but Colin Firth's (Lord Henry Wotton) are stern and brisk, intoned as if to be something to be remembered for the next quiz, highly entertaining and still (if not more) amusing. Dorian learns them well (as we know). Colin Firth is a versatile actor and I like him especially in this vein, the aristocratic bearing with the air of authority and sophistication, not to be messed with. A wonderful screen presence. The star of the show (for me).",Dorian Gray
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Really troubling version of the story,5,5 November 2012,"When a young aristocrat arrives in London and begins to indulge in a life of hedonism and excess, he finds he doesn't age physically despite trying to harbor a deadly secret that will shatter his image forever.This was a dull, utterly horror-less Horror/Drama that, once again, falls victim to that one singular, nearly inescapable aspect of recent British horror films, a dreary pace that drags stuff out far longer than it should by showcasing scenes that have no horror in them yet are supposed to be presented as such. Watching a person drink, smoke, do drugs and engage in orgies with highly unattractive women while everyone around him wonders why he still looks the same isn't horrific, yet that seems to be the entire crux of what passes as horror in the film. That the mystical painting isn't shown at all until the end might have something to do with that, and the total lack of explanation for such an event is also glossed over, and it's not until the final ten minutes that something starts happening, and while it's good stuff with the reincarnated spirit and the grand old-school Gothic burning-down-the-house scenario, it's too little too late.Rated R: Violence, Nudity, sex scenes and drug use.",Dorian Gray
17,gradyharp,'You are the Fire of your Life.',10,22 July 2010,"DORIAN GRAY as adapted form Oscar Wilde's famous novel 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and directed by Oliver Parker is about as fine a transfer of a period novel to the screen as has been made of late. The settings, costumes, and acting are all outstanding and with Parker's 'enhancing' some of the debauchery in the transformed life of this famous character updated to allow for more sensuality and brutality than prior cinematic versions, the tale really becomes dramatic. Dorian Gray (Ben Barnes), an orphaned, abused child who happens to inherit a mansion in London upon the death of his only relative, comes to London as a young inordinately handsome yet shy man. He is immediately seizes the attention of Lord Henry Wotton (Colin Firth) who believes that the only goal in life is to respond to your desires, to your sensual needs. Dorian is introduced to a young painter Basil Hallward (Ben Chaplin) who is attracted to Dorian's beauty and as he paints his portrait he becomes enamored with his model. As the portrait is completed Lord Henry suggests that Dorian could always remain as beautiful as his portrait if he 'sold his soul' to remain ever youthful. Dorian takes up the idea and follows Lord Henry's tutelage to drink, smoke, and carouse in brothels, opium dens, and in the boudoirs of all the middle aged ladies of society. He encounters a beautiful young actress Sibyl Vane (Rachel Hurd-Wood), falls in love only to cast her aside (we later discover that her body has been thrown into the river much to the chagrin of her brother James (Johnny Harris). As Dorian's thirst for lusty and scandalous behaviors increases he causes much harm: the mutual attraction between Dorian and Basil eventually results in Dorian butchering Basil and discarding his body into the river grave. Dorian decides to leave London and travel to exotic places to try to fill his lascivious appetite: he returns twenty odd years later and every one has aged except Dorian. Lord Henry's daughter Emily (Rebecca Hall), born when Dorian departed London, is Dorian's intellectual match and the two are mutually attracted but Lord Henry violently objects, knowing what the real Dorian Gray is inside. Dorian's secret - that he remains young eternally while his portrait ages and reveals the vile aspects of his corrupt life - is finally revealed and the ending is a gruesome one. Ben Barnes, Colin Firth, Ben Chaplin, and Rebecca Hall are all superb in their roles - as are all of the many well-known fine British actors who fill minor roles. The DVD adds comments from many of these actors in a way that focuses on Oscar Wilde's novel, making the commitment of everyone involved seem more acutely aware of the film's purpose. It is a very well photographed, costumes, and lighted piece of cinematography - a truly excellent period piece for this great novel to come alive again. Grady Harp",Dorian Gray
18,trashgang,Oliver Parker let me down knowing his background as actor,5,10 October 2011,"I won't go into the story itself, everybody knows what it is all about and on who's novel it is based. Did I enjoy it, yes on some parts. Did I like it, as a horror buff, no, and that's the strange part of it. It is always available on the horror shelves and be honest. I don't think that an actor like Colin Firth would appear in a horror. But I'm stuck with this flick and the thing I didn't like was naturally the use of CGI. When the face of the painting is shown and is decaying some maggots are running in the face of the picture. Sadly that was done with CGI. There is of course some red stuff in it but don't hope to see the knife going in. That was another let down on my account. Okay, Dorian do get a lot of red stuff on him when he's killing a friend but it's never bloody. On the other hand Dorian do has a lot of sex, again it is never explicit. There is a bit of nudity, a nipple there and a tit here, but not to graphic. So it is clear for me that it was made for the main public. Naturally in these kind of flicks the acting has to be sublime and it does. If you see what Colin is doing, he has a lot of text, well it's normal that he got his Oscar. But if I look purely as a geek in the genre then I thought it would be better. But don't get me wrong. I don't have anything against blockbusters, just look at Dracula or Interview With A Vampire. I liked them. To end, it's so strange that the director Oliver Parker had failed a bit, as a director I haven't seen any of his other flicks but if I tell you that he played Peloquin in Clive Barker's Nightbreed or was in Hellraiser 2 I thought it would have been gorier or at least bloodier.",Dorian Gray
19,siderite,"Nicely done, nicely played, but nothing extraordinary",9,5 April 2010,"If I am to dislike something in the movie, it's the story flow. Some scenes just moved on fast, without any emotional attachment, and that bothered me. However, everything else was top notch. The actors all played well, the story was interesting, the feelings of the characters evoked quite clearly, the music perfect for the task.Now, I knew the story, so I didn't quite feel excitement with the plot because of it, yet the interpretation was nice and made me watch it with interest.On a personal note, Maryam D'Abo, the X-Tro Bond girl, was playing one of the aging noblewomen in Dorian's entourage. I had the biggest crush on her once. How time passes on.Bottom line: it is certainly worth a watch, even if you have to be in the mood to see a film freely displaying emotional cruelty and depravation.",Dorian Gray
20,JamesHitchcock,Pleasure is not the same thing as happiness,8,23 October 2009,"Dorian Gray is a wealthy, handsome young gentleman who is one of the leading lights of London's high society in the early 1890s. (Oscar Wilde probably chose the Christian name Dorian for his hero because of its association with the French ""d'or"", meaning ""golden"", and the phrase ""jeunesse dorée"", or ""gilded youth""). He is befriended by the successful artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait, and the older libertine Lord Henry Wotton. Henry introduces Dorian to the pleasures of the city and to his own hedonistic philosophy. Pleasure, in Henry's view, is the only thing worth living for. Dorian takes this philosophy to heart. He has fallen in love with a young actress named Sibyl Vane, and has proposed marriage to her, but breaks off the engagement on Henry's advice. The heartbroken Sibyl commits suicide, and Dorian's initial grief at her death disappears as he abandons himself to a lifestyle of selfish hedonism. There is also a subplot involving Sybil's brother James, who vows revenge against the man whom he holds responsible for his sister's death.Running parallel with the story of what happens to Dorian is the story of what happens to his picture. When the portrait is unveiled, he says that he would give anything to stay as young and handsome as he is in the picture, and this is precisely what happens. Dorian finds that he never ages and remains ever-youthful, whereas the marks of ageing start to appear on the portrait, which he moves from his hallway to a secret room in his attic. The latter part of the film takes place some twenty-five years later during the First World War. Henry is by now an old man but Dorian, who should by now be middle-aged, still looks as young as he did in 1890. Dorian begins a romance with Henry's daughter Emily, much to the disgust of her father.The film was made by the recently revived British company Ealing Studios. (They seem to specialise in Wilde adaptations, having made ""An Ideal Husband"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", both also directed by Oliver Parker.) Ealing were also responsible for last year's ""Easy Virtue"", and like that film ""Dorian Gray"" stars both Ben Barnes and Colin Firth. In the earlier film they played father and son; here, as Henry, Firth can be seen as a metaphorical father-figure to Barnes's Dorian. (Dorian is actually an orphan who was brought up by a brutally strict uncle; his adoption of a hedonistic lifestyle can, psychologically, be seen as a reaction against the harshness of his childhood).Henry is not only a father-figure, he is also a corrupter, under whose malign influence Dorian's character deteriorates until he is even more monstrous than Henry himself. What partially saves Henry is, paradoxically, his hypocrisy, something normally regarded as a vice. Henry might preach about the advantages of a totally hedonistic lifestyle, but he is never quite prepared to practise what he preaches. It seems clear that his obsession with Dorian's youth and beauty stems from repressed homosexual or bisexual tendencies, but he never acts upon them (unlike Dorian, who has a gay relationship with Basil). Henry realises that Victorian society, although officially disapproving of promiscuity, is prepared to turn a blind eye to an upper-class Casanova provided he remains strictly heterosexual. Henry's disapproval of Dorian's relationship with Emily may seem hypocritical, given that Henry himself has been guilty of corrupting other men's daughters, but at least it shows that his natural feelings are not completely dead.Dorian, by contrast, is prepared to follow his mentor's teaching in full and allow unbridled freedom to his appetites. The changes in the portrait do not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age but also the state of his soul. By the end of the film the face in the portrait is that of a hideous old man, far older than the forty-something Dorian would have been at this time. The message of the film is that pleasure corrupts and that absolute pleasure corrupts absolutely; if one makes pleasure one's sole aim in life, one runs the danger of becoming thoroughly selfish and immoral.I must admit that I did not think much of Ben Barnes when I first saw his wooden performance in ""Prince Caspian"", but he was better in ""Easy Virtue"" and better still here, bringing out the contrast between the naïve young man of the early scenes and the corrupt roué of the later ones. The one performance I did not like came from Rachel Hurd-Wood, who I thought was rather weak as Sibyl, but Rebecca Hall made an attractively spirited heroine as Emily. The star of the film, however, was Colin Firth, on top form as the seductively sinister dandy Henry.The film is visually attractive, especially the interior scenes. Henry and Dorian's London townhouses are both decorated in a luxurious and elegant, but severely masculine Arts and Crafts style, with much dark, polished woodwork. (The late Victorian and Edwardian period did have a more graceful, feminine, aesthetic exemplified by the Art Nouveau movement, but we see little of this in the film). This was perhaps intended to symbolise the misogynistic nature of their philosophy; indeed, Wilde's novel can be seen as very male-orientated, and the liberated feminist Emily (a character who does not appear in the book) may have been invented to balance this.Complaints have been made that the film is not 100% faithful to the original novel, but filmed adaptations of literary works never are, and I found that ""Dorian Gray"" was one that works well in its own right. It is a thought-provoking film with its own moral: that, as Dorian discovers too late, pleasure is not the same thing as happiness. 8/10",Dorian Gray
21,Rainey-Dawn,A Good Version of Dorian Gray,10,26 June 2014,"WOW I cannot believe the rating on this film at IMDb - it's lower than I expected it to be. And several negative comments about it too yet I do find others that enjoyed the movie as much as I did, giving it good reviews.I personally liked this Gothic version of Dorian Gray - well acted out and the scenery and sets are beautiful! As far as the story goes - I very much liked it. I realize there are changes from the book which is nothing unusual. So many films are different from the book and yes sometimes criticized harshly for the changes OR they are praised for it.Ben Barnes is a nice looking man in my opinion. That is just a matter of personal preference as to if you think someone is nice looking or not. Not everyone will agree on who is the perfect man to play Dorian Gray. So those that review this movie and bash Ben Barnes' looks should think twice - and remember that everyone will not agree on who is ""good looking"" enough for this role! The truth is NO ONE is.... NO ONE is so good looking and charming that they can seduce almost anyone -- that's the fantasy and fiction aspect of this fictional story! The movie is very good and should not be dismiss as bad because some people didn't like the film. Simply watch it an judge for yourselves.10/10",Dorian Gray
