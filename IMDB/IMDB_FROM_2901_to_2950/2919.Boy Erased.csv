0,bkoganbing,Here and queer,9,20 November 2018,"Boy Erased is a film concerning the most timely topic of conversion therapy in
regard to sexual orientation. There aren't any legitimate scientists on this planet
who think that conversion therapy is possible or even desirable. But far too many still take their cues from a fundamentalist reading of the Bible. The
consequences are devastating too many who have bought into it.Our protagonist is Lucas Hedges son of preacher Russell Crowe and Nicole
Kidman. The two are from small town Arkansas and when Hedges confesses
he has some unwanted sexual urges regarding men, at least Crowe's duty is
clear. Got to get this kid into some kind of therapy, scare him straight if it be
necessary. In Crowe's upbringing this is wrong, but this just can't be for a
preacher's son. If thry thought about it Hedges was raised in a perfect Christian environment, was apparently never any kind of bad behavioral child,
so how could two Christian parents raise a gay son?It's a failure to think outside the box of fundamentalist religion. Kidman starts
thinking outside the box pretty quickly, she's a mom first. But being the good
Christian wife she defers on spiritual matters to her husband.Crowe's an interesting character. He's not one of those preachers with the
mega churches raking in the bucks. His day job is a car dealership and that is
what he wants to pass on to his son. But if Hedges won't live a godly life as
Crowe's been taught to see it, he can't live there. Like so many he won't think
outside the box and that is why conversion therapy still grips the fundamentalist mind.Director Joel Edgerton cast himself as Victor Sykes who heads the conversion
therapy group that Hedges is sent to. What a snake oil salesman this guy is
with a staff that would have felt at home in the Spanish Inquisition. The kids
sent there are from home's like the one Hedges has and also are conditioned
not to think outside the box.I won't get into the practices that are supposed to convert, but considering some of the stories I have heard if anything Boy Erased was modest in their
depiction.Some years ago I corresponded with a gay man from Cullman, Alabama who
in his 30s had just gotten sick and tired of trying to live his life to please his
fundamentalist community and friends. While he was trying to ""convert"" he
got the cluck clucks of sympathy for the struggle he was going through and
that everyone was behind him. When he decided that what he was going through for other people was nonsense, the 'friends' he had in the town just
turned on him overnight. Out and proud in Alabama is no mean feat.This film will get some Oscars. With 10 nominations for Best Picture Boy Erased is sure to be in the running. Oscars could be in the offing for Hedges,
Kidman, and Crowe, maybe even Edgerton pulling off Best Director and Best
Supporting Actor.One performance that will break your heart is that of Brittan Sear playing
fellow teen getting the 'cure'. Hopefully big things are in store for this
young man in his acting career.This review is dedicated to two people. First off to Mathew Shurka who leads
the fight state by state and locality by locality to ban this cruel and obnoxious
practice. Secondly this goes out to my friend from Cullman, Alabama in the
hopes he's healthy, happy and in a place he can be at peace with himself.",Boy Erased
1,SnoopyStyle,intriguing story but lacking,5,25 August 2019,"Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges) is an all-American boy. He's on his high school basketball team and has a girlfriend. His father (Russell Crowe) is a Baptist preacher. His mother (Nicole Kidman) insists that he keeps his arm inside a moving car. In college, he is raped by his roommate. He goes home to be confronted by the incident. He admits to having feelings toward men. His father sends him to a gay conversion therapy program run by Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton).It's very odd that most of the big name actors come from Australia. They are so prevalent that the location does not feel American. I know it's based on real biography but it needs some feeling of a small southern religious community. Also the flashback construction does not help. It does not help to set up the parents son relationships which is desperately needed. There are some really compelling scenes about the therapy program. The ritualized beating with the bible is depressing. It's depressing in the religious sense where a Godly book is used as a literal weapon. The bathroom scene with the older man watching is rather creepy. The angry-with-your-dad scene almost saves Jared as a character. In general, he's a blank. He is clueless to the point that he lacks agency. The boy started college and I hope that he wasn't that naive. Basically, he needs to be set up as an all-American boy scout. This is where the flashback structure defeats the movie. He needs to be Superman but we're not told about Smallville or Krypton. By the end, the pieces fell into place and the story is fine. It doesn't make the movie good but the story is saved. Overall, there is an intriguing story within the pages. On screen, it's a bit lacking.",Boy Erased
2,Horst_In_Translation,Boy erased - good story created,6,27 February 2019,"""Boy Erased"" (not the greatest tite in my opinion as it feels not fitting to describe what is going on, unless you define the ""boy"" as the love interest, but this surely wasn't meant) is an Australian/American co-production from 2018 that runs for almost two hours and was directed by Joel Edgerton, who is just one of many successful actors that try to make an impact as directors these days and surely he is among the top tier you can say. This was a really good movie and it also speaks for him that in addition, he plays a crucial character and was also in charge of adapting the memoir of the man this film is based on. Edgerton is Australien and he plays the main antagonist and also Australian are Oscar winners Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman and it took really long for them to finally appear in a movie together. They play husband and wife and mother and father to Lucas Hedges' character. Hedges is the only lead actor here. He managed to score a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal in a year where he actually had two strong performances in the awards race. The other is the film in which he plays Julia Roberts' drug-addicted son (Ben is Back). But we talked about that one already, so now let us take a look at this one. By the way, it scored another Golden Globe nomination for a song featured in the movie, but at the Oscars it came short. Edgerton will be okay with it. His film here is about a young man who is sent to an organization that tells people that it will turn homosexual men into straight men again and lead them back on the right path to (religious) righteousness. So yeah, you know what to expect already. I must say the scenes there are really only interesting thanks to Edgerton. And thanks to the reactions of these young men. One talks to his parents about what is going on there and they take him back home. Another eventually commits suicide. Another acts as if their methods are working.But none of them is Jared (who has to find his own way). It is also interesting how initially he was perfectly fine with going there, with having his mind changed because he realized he was different. Of course, this also has a whole lot to do with his upbringing and with being the son of a priest and an almost equally religious mother. He was mesmerized by the ""guru""s charisma early on, but absurd messages change his mind relatively quickly. And rightfully so you can say. I am frequently critical when it comes to talking about films that feel just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood, but this is not one of these movies. The story feels way below the surface frequently (if we ignore the slightly clumsy idea of holding your arm out of the car to feel freedom) and I was at the edge of my seat for quite a while. Towards the end, I even considered giving it 4 out of 5 stars, but eventually I stayed at 3, even if there were some really good moments. One reason may be the talk between the protagonist and his dad near the end. This scene felt so right, so interesting content-wise and it could have been great, but sadly I must say that Hedges while being solid for almost the entire film messed this one up. He has one particularly bad moment of line delivery, but he is absolutely not on par with Crowe for the entire scene and that disappointed me so much. Crowe is really good, you see he is getting older and chubbier now in his mid50s, but still has it all range-wise. Kidman was fairly good too, even if it was a really thankful role with how likable her character is, especially at the end, but also before that, even if she won't stand up against her husband. I must say I did not like her one bit in her younger years, but I have seen several good films and performances from her recently. I hope it stays that way.And finally, maybe the funniest thing about this film, still somewhat tragically funny, is when we read the information at the end that Edgerton's character's real life equivalent left his organization and lived again with a man. Which shows basically that it is really all about suppressing these homosexual feelings and not ""curing"" them. You could say it like that. All in all, this was a pretty good film I would say and I recommend checking it out. There are several pretty heavy moments, most of all a rape scene that is unrelated to the core plot, but still may feel heavy to watch, even if it is over fairly quickly. So perhaps don't take your young children with you when you decide to check this one out. But the latter you should certainly do. I give it a thumbs-up. Positively recommended and it also felt shorter than it actually was, which at this running time is always a success.",Boy Erased
3,kosmasp,Trying to erase,9,26 March 2021,"The fact that people who have homosexual feelings/tendencies ... who are different are being viewed as being ""sick"" by some in society is really something abhorent. And something that one would hope is a thing of the past. But unfortunately, here we are talking about such cases - or one in particular when it comes to this movie right here. <brBecause this is base on a real story and real people. Someone who might be cynical or mean might add that Russell Crowe got in ""shape"" to resemble the actual father he is portraying. But that would as I already stated not be a nice thing to do. He and Nicole Kidman are phenomenal in this movie. As is their ""kid"" - the actor really puts on a clinic of a perfomance - no pun intended. But his performance is quite low key ... throughout, he seems so reserved, so willing to eat up his anger, so not able to actually show what is going on inside him. Of course that is especially the case, because if someone has feelings like he has and has a father who is unable to show emotion (might feel like a cliche but works very nicely here) ... it is inevitable that he also will have some issues of his own ...",Boy Erased
4,lee_eisenberg,...vs. The Miseducation of Cameron Post,7,6 July 2019,"""Boy Erased"" and ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post"" got released around the same time. Both focus on gay conversion therapy, wherein religious institutions try to force children to suppress their sexual orientation. I don't know if the release of the two unrelated movies led to any kind of rivalry between them, but I can sincerely recommend both. This one is based on a boy's memoir of getting sent to a church that tried to force him to reject his natural desires. The people who run these programs are lunatics.Part of why this is important is because this process is still legal in most of the US. Indeed, Mike Pence supported it as governor of Indiana. I recently participated in a rehearsal for a musical called ""Pray the Gay Away"", a satire on conversion therapy. Everyone should see these movies. Make no mistake about it, these programs are a form of torture.",Boy Erased
5,jboothmillard,Boy Erased,5,17 February 2019,"I saw the lead actress talking about this film on The Graham Norton Show, it sounded very interesting, because of the controversial subject matter, and then I realised it was based on a true story, so I went to the cinema to see it. Basically Jared Eamon (Golden Globe nominated Lucas Hedges) is the son of Marshall Eamons (Russell Crowe), a successful car dealer and Baptist preacher in Arkansas, and Nancy Eamons (Nicole Kidman), a self-styled hairdresser. He begins his first day at the Love In Action gay conversion therapy assessment program. Chief therapist Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton, also directing) tells the group that their sexuality is a choice influenced by poor parenting. He instructs them to perform harsh ""moral inventories"" of themselves and their families and requires them not to tell anyone else about what occurs during the sessions. Nancy rents a nearby motel for her and Jared to stay in until he completes the assessment, but the therapy has no set end point, and may require him to move into an on-campus home if he fails to convince Sykes that he has become straight. Jared's life prior to entering the program shows him well-adjusted and happy but breaks up with his girlfriend upon starting college. There he becomes friends with student Henry (Joe Alwyn), and has a brief, romantic, intimate encounter with art student, Xavier (Théodore Pellerin). While staying the night in Jared's dorm room, Henry rapes Jared and tearfully confesses that he has done the same to another young man. Jared is traumatised returns home to recover, but receives a call from Henry, posing as a school counsellor, in order to out Jared and ensure his silence. Jared confesses to his parents that he is attracted to men, after Marshall has consulted with other pastors, Jared reluctantly agrees to attend a conversion therapy his father has signed him up for. Weeks into his therapy, Jared gets to know the other attendees also seeking to become straight. Some are fanatically devoted to conversion, like Jon (Xavier Dolan), who has gone to the point where he refuses to even touch other men. Others are merely ""playing the part"", like Gary (Troye Sivan), who is pretending that the therapy is working until he can be released and return to a normal life. At her insistence, Jared lets Nancy read the program's handbook, which is full of questionable psychology and obvious grammatical errors. After failing an exercise, attendee Cameron (Britton Sear) is humiliated by Sykes in front of the group and intimidated with a fake funeral service. Then Cameron is beaten with bibles by both the therapists and his own family and forcibly dunked in a bathtub in one of the program's prison-like homes. Jared challenges Sykes when the therapist suggests during an exercise that Jared hates his father. He storms out and is able to retrieve his mobile phone to call his mother to pick him up. Sykes, counsellors, and the other attendees corner Jared, but cannot touch him, and Cameron stands up for him to escort Jared and Nancy safely out. Nancy is horrified and ashamed that she allowed Marshall to enrol him in a program without researching its practices. Marshall remains furious about Jared dropping out of the program, for remaining homosexual, and refuses to speak with him. Soon after leaving the program, Jared learns that Cameron has committed suicide while still in its care. Jared becomes distraught, Marshall approaches and tries to console him, but Jared turns away. Four years later, Jared has moved to New York City, he has written an article exposing the realities of conversion therapy. Jared returns home to convince his father to read the article and take accountability for his actions, and the two begin to reconcile. Also starring Cherry Jones as Dr. Muldoon, Madelyn Cline as Chloe, Emily Hinkler as Lee and Devin Michael as Anders. Hedges gives a splendid performance as the young man struggling with his sexuality and the strict nature and pressures of the therapy, Kidman is good as his understanding and concerned mother, Edgerton is reasonable as the quietly menacing program leader, and Crowe does fine as the preacher father. The fact that these (most often religious) therapy programs, retreats and facilities, trying to turn those who are homosexual (gay and lesbian) (also those addicted to pornography, and promiscuous), exist is terrifying, I was expecting this film to feel more claustrophobic and devastating, but it is a sensitive and well-acted story, an interesting biographical drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Revelation"". Worth watching!",Boy Erased
6,CinemaSerf,Penetrating exposé on the things that are done in the name of goodness...,7,21 January 2021,"When ""Jared"" (Lucas Hedges) comes out to his parents, aged 18, his father - a preacher/car dealer ""Marshall"" (Russell Crowe) and mother ""Nancy"" (Nicole Kidman) resort to sending him to an institution where he is put under the tutelage of ""Skyes"" (Joel Edgerton) with a view to ""curing him""... Were it not based on the true reminiscences of the author, this could just be another piece of worst-case scenario gay coming-of-age stories designed to enlighten and horrify. The fact that it is true makes that horror even more stupefying. It brings to the fore the whole nature or nurture conversation that is excellently - if somewhat odiously - exemplified here by (director) Edgerton who attempts to effect profound change on these young men using the tools of a bully; using the tools of shame and of religion. He deconstructs their personalities leaving them riddled with self-loathing and confused in the hope that, frankly, they will admit to having four legs if they are asked. As an actor, Hedges doesn't quite cut it, he is there but is still a bit dead behind the eyes - and neither Crowe nor Kidman really feature much as characters to make any great dent in the proceedings. Much of the potency and emphasis is left to our own appreciation of how families try to cope with homosexual children and how love (of themselves, their families, their God) can lead people to do thoughtless, dangerous and selfish things...",Boy Erased
7,writers_reign,Now You See Him,5,11 February 2019,"It's hard to know who would be the best person to discuss this film - is it someone like me who had never heard of it and, by definition knew nothing about it, or would it be preferable to approach someone who inhabits the memi-monde, someone who may have even been in a program like the one depicted here. Swings and roundabouts probably. In my case I was at a loose end on Saturday night so I drove to a Multiplex with no idea what was playing and asked if there was anything about to be screened. The cashier consulted the time table and said that Boy Erased would be showing in ten minutes. I'd never heard of it, certainly not seen any reviews. All the cashier knew was that it starred Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe so I figured it would probably be half-decent. It didn't take long to discover it was set in the Jurassic Age or, to put it another way it was set in an America where people believe seriously that homosexuality in teenagers can be cured by Aversion Therapy. I don't know if Nicole Kidman and/or Russell Crowe subscribe to this belief but they did lend their names to the film and received star billing although their roles as the parents of a teenage son who has been 'outed' and shipped to a sort of cross between boot camp and military college are peripheral and the film - based on a true account, written by a man who attended a Q and A with his real mother - is little more than a record of the time he spent there. There were about three other people in the cinema, a major multiplex on a Saturday night. All the technical credits - writing, directing, acting, were up to snuff but its only audience may well be the LBGT supporters.",Boy Erased
8,evanston_dad,Boy Erased,7,6 March 2019,"""Boy Erased"" is one of those ""preaching to the choir"" movies. Those who will bother to watch it will already agree that programs designed to erase homosexuality from young people are stupid and wrong. Those that still need convincing will never watch the movie in the first place.So, as one who need not have been convinced, I will say that I was pleased that actor/director Joel Edgerton takes a restrained approach and avoids the sentimental histrionics that might have tempted another director. Lord help us all if Steven Spielberg had gotten his hands on the same material. But perhaps, given my lukewarm emotional reaction, the film is a bit too restrained? A cast of good actors, including Lucas Hedges as the titular boy, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe as his parents, and Edgerton himself as leader of the program (who ends up being a closeted case himself, a development anyone could see coming from a mile away), all turn in thoughtful, intelligent performances. But the film itself stubbornly remains solidly competent rather than something special. I was never bored, but neither was I ever really moved.Grade: B",Boy Erased
9,ferguson-6,what is wrong with people?,7,9 November 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. It has taken two movies this year, THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST and this one from writer-director-producer-actor Joel Edgerton, and I finally understand that the practice of conversion therapy (treatment designed to change a person's orientation to heterosexual from something else) is real ... and it's widespread ... and it's cruel ... and it's absurd. I'll readily admit that my little life bubble has previously protected me from knowing much about the world of conversion.Lucas Hedges has quickly developed into a dependable dramatic actor with his moving performances in such films as MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, LADY BIRD, and MID90S. Here he stars as Jared Eamons, a college aged young man struggling with the inner turmoil that accompanies being a gay man raised by a Pastor-dad in the heart of the Bible belt. Since the film is based on the memoir of Garrard Conley, we can assume much of what we see and hear has been seen and heard by Mr. Conley in his life.Jared's parents are played by Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, and while the parental actions of their characters may confound us, both deliver strong performances. One especially impactful scene allows Ms. Kidman to show what sets her apart ... it occurs in her scene at a table with Hedges when momma finally takes control. Director Edgerton appears as Victor Sykes, the director and ""therapist"" at Love In Action, the refuge program where Jared's parents send him.Over the opening credits we get childhood clips showing Jared was a ""normal"" little boy being raised in a loving household. Flash forward to his awkward date with a girlfriend who asks him ""what's wrong?"". Later, after being sexually assaulted by a college buddy, Jared comes out to his parents. His time in Sykes' program is filled with unimaginable steps. A Genogram is to be completed, listing all of the personal problems and ""dangerous"" traits of relatives on the family tree - the point is to isolate the source of sin. One boy is beaten with bibles by his family in an effort to drive out the demons of homosexuality (nope, that's not a joke). There is also a macho counselor (played by Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers) who gives inspiring manly talks and teaches how to look, act, and stand like a real man. It's all so pathetic and tragic.Rather than focus on Jared and the others in the program, much of the time is spent with his parents and why/how they could make the decision to enter him into conversion therapy. Jared's dad tells him he won't be loved by God ... a message also delivered by Sykes. When Jared's mom (Kidman) states ""our family is so normal"", we aren't sure whether she believes it, or wishes it so - although she leaves no doubt how she pictures a normal family. Of course, it's really Jared's dad (Crowe) who takes the news as a personal affront to his manhood and religious beliefs ... beliefs somehow more important than his own son.Support work is provided by Joe Alwyn, Cherry Jones (as a doctor, and the only reasonable adult), Frank Hoyt Taylor, Britton Sear, and Jess LeTourette. Filmmaker Xavier Dolan (MOMMY, 2014) also has a role as Jon, one of those in the program. The music is provided by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurrianns, and for the most part, director Edgerton stays consistent with his focus on characters - though his frequent use of slo-motion loses impact with each successive use. The film avoids any cheap sentimentality or emotional gut-punches, instead focusing on the daily dealings. Perhaps it's meant to appeal to parents in this situation - those parents who are confused and misguided. We see this film more than we feel it, although I often found myself looking at these parents and asking, 'what's wrong with these people?' When the film ends by telling us 36 states allow for conversion therapy, we quickly realize Jared's parents may be more 'normal' than we thought (incredible as it seems).",Boy Erased
10,gradyharp,A very disturbing but very important film,10,3 February 2019,"BOY ERASED is a true memoir written by Gerrad Conley about his experiences with conversion therapy - that church oriented isolation of gay men and women intent on restoring them back from their sinful ways and Satan's influence. As adapted for the screen by Joel Edgerton (who also directs an plays a very prominent role of the man who is in charge of the conversion school), the film is intense and revelatory about a near cult-like 'business' of correcting the 'disease of homosexuality.'As the synopsis states, This film tells the courageous story of Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges), the son of a Baptist pastor Marshall Eamons (Russell Crowe) in a small American town, who must overcome the fallout of being outed to his parents - his mother Nancy Eamons (Nicole Kidman) is supportive of her husband's response. His parents struggle with reconciling their love for their son with their beliefs. Fearing a loss of family, friends, and community, Jared is pressured into attending a conversion therapy program. While there, Jared comes into conflict with its leader Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton) and begins his journey to finding his own voice and accepting his true self.The sessions in the therapy program dominate the film, with flashbacks of Jared in college and his rare gay acting out episodes with Henry (Joe Alwyn) and Xavier (Theodore Pellerin), misconstrued by invasive research by Sykes and his entourage. The fellow gay people are very well portrayed by Troye Sivan, Britton Sear, Emily Hinkler among others and one of the more realistic - about LGBTQ issues - characters, a Dr. Muldoon, is beautifully portrayed by Cherry Jones.Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe and Joel Edgerton are all outstanding. The jolts of the film are many - including the facts about the characters as they are living now - and it is not an easy film to experience the truths about conversion therapy. But this is not only a fine film but also an important one for the public to learn about a process that still exists in some states.",Boy Erased
11,blanbrn,It's okay to be who you are and be different don't change.,8,26 November 2018,"""Boy Erased"" is a film based on a real life case about a young man who's outed by his conservative religious southern parents for being gay and he's then sent to a church like gay conversion center. This is now a method of hot topic conversation that has caused debate as many see as punishment and the film showed some of the treatment to back that up.Set in Arkansas Jared Eamons(in a good performance from Lucas Hedges) is a young man who's attracted to men and he knows that it's not learned behavior he's born that way his christian and conservative parents the dad a Baptist preacher Marshall(Russell Crowe) and elegant and overprotected caring southern belle mother Nancy(in a super turn from the wonderful Nicole Kidman) decide to put Jared in a conversion camp to change him to become straight.The camp is tough and hard with class and military like talk that involves the right way to talk and a course in manners is given and physical training is done. And it's like the teachers force confessions from their gay students, yet all it really is that of a religious seminar that tries to tech moral reasoning and make each feel guilt as it's like it was a choice a deal that they the students made with the devil. Along the way you see it's mental and verbal torture and some forms of punishment are physical.Nancy, Jared's mom comes to realize and love her son for who he is this film sends a strong message of love and proves that no matter who if a person is different they are still the same with love, emotion, pain, and thought. As it's okay to be different and who you are as fake conversion therapy won't change a person's real heart or real mind. Overall good eye opening film to see and it has you to respect people who are different from the norm.",Boy Erased
12,MOscarbradley,Nicely low-key and very well acted.,7,14 November 2019,"Considering the earnestness of the subject matter, (gay conversion therapy), Joel Edgerton's film ""Boy Erased"", (something of a labour of love; he wrote it and directed it and plays the head of the institute), is a lot more engaging than it might have been, not to mention being a lot less preachy and as you can probably gather from the cast, it's very well acted. Lucas Hedges is the gay teenager outed to his parents, (his father is a Baptist preacher), and then finds himself in a gay conversion programme run by Edgerton.It's the kind of picture that once upon a time would have worn its credentials, like medals, on its puffed-out chest but Edgerton keeps it nicely, and surprisingly, low-key and no-one overplays their hand. Crowe hasn't been this good in ages, Kidman is her typically wonderful self, Hedges fulfills the promise he showed in ""Manchester by the Sea"" and Edgerton is marvellous as the unconventional would-be analyst. It could have been more 'exciting', (maybe it's a mite too low-key), but neither is it exploitative or sensationalist and it's good to see a gay-themed film that doesn't follow convention.",Boy Erased
13,ThomasDrufke,Tremendously Moving,9,1 December 2018,"There were few trailers in 2018 that were as impactful as the Boy Erased trailers. And I'm beyond pleased to say that the movie is just as good as those trailers. What is both a strong character piece about someone in the middle of a family drama and a beautifully touching romantic coming of age film. Joel Edgerton crafts the script impressively and once again proves himself as a more than capable director, especially in such difficult and timely subject matter. The performances are top notch, and I think Nicole Kidman's turn as a torn Mother between two very different points of view with her family, is a thing of beauty and something only an all time great actress can so effectively portray. I was moved to an emotional place that few films have put me in at all in 2018.9.2/10",Boy Erased
14,Cineanalyst,Too Straight,5,7 March 2019,"Had ""Boy Erased"" came out just a few years ago, wherein homosexuality and gay rights were still largely viewed unfavorably even in the West, its sermonizing would've been more relevant, which may've compensated some for its lackluster drama and execution. In 2018, however, public opinion polls have revealed that even a majority of residents of Arkansas, where ""Boy Erased"" is set, favor gay marriage--let alone disapprove of the abusive pseudoscience of conversion therapy, the subject of the movie. This is such a johnny-come-lately message picture that it was released only a couple months after another movie critical of conversion therapy came out, ""The Miseducation of Cameron Post."" Camps trying to turn people straight have long been so transparently ridiculous and evil that they've been parodied by being turned into camp in the media for more than half a generation now, from ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" (1999) to a more-than-a-decade-old episode of ""South Park.""Lack of timeliness aside, ""Boy Erased"" is a rather dreary affair. The colors and picture are dull to look at, the acting is oft overly restrained to the point of no interest, and the flashback structure comes off as derivative and breaks up the dramatic flow of the plot. These problems remind me of another recent PSA-type account with an obvious message and ""boy"" in the title, ""Beautiful Boy"" (2018). While that one was about drug addiction, both are based on the true stories as written by the real-life protagonists. At least, ""Boy Erased"" does do a bit better job than its peer in integrating the role of the author within the narrative. It also has the interesting and potentially self-reflexive subject of actors playing characters who are acting. In this case, the gay kids try to fake being straight. Ironically, though, the only character and performance that holds much interest here is the one who does experience a dramatic conversion of sorts: the role of the mother played by Nicole Kidman.The other ironies here are less appealing. Part of the movie is about the harm such religious sermonizing can do and, yet, the movie itself is a sermon. Additionally, for a movie celebrating queerness, its structure is shamefully straight to the point. ""Boy Erased"" barely offers any moments for us to connect with the characters or the emotion of a situation before proceeding from point A to point B in its didactic proselytizing. Heck, two of the most shocking events in the story (the ultimate fates of a particularly abused kid at the camp and of the camp councilor) are largely glossed over, while depictions of homosexuality are reduced to the polar opposites of hand holding and rape. Had there at least been more moments of the kind that Kidman had, this could've been better.",Boy Erased
15,westsideschl,Balanced?,8,31 January 2019,"For most of the movie I thought it was more favorable in view towards the importance of following the Bible and supporting the family, and whatever it takes to maintain that connection. Then we get into the ""Love in Action"" conversion program which seemed relatively harmless & straightforward at first when it seemed to allow some exchange of thoughts between counselors and patients. But, in this particular program eventually the behavioral modification gets intimidating, if not physical. Programs's basic premise is ""... that you can be born gay, that's not true ... that is a lie."" a viewpoint counter to all medical, genetic research.

Anyway, ""Boy Erased"" tells a true story and does this so well - acting, directing, writing were all excellent as well some good and haunting music.Overall, ""Boy Erased"" is very easy to watch because it is excellently made, but also its kinda hard to watch of the things it shows. That is some great film right here.",Boy Erased
17,ops-52535,wonderful film,9,16 January 2019,"This is just a fantastic movie, the filmography are at times spellbinding,the music are well stitcehed in the play, the fight between the forces are deadly but brilliantly performed by the actors. lucas hedges are really making a deep impression with his acting, and mygod ,he has an overload of potential in the art of acting. russel crowe plays the father character with great experience,and pushes the right buttons at the right spots.lgbtq, god you need a cheating note to remember what it means, versus religion + america=its a tie anyway, and will always be so as long as human stubborness are present. im glad i can stand on the sideline and look at it .its a heartbreaking film and im sure many will cry,many will become even more angry and stubborn,but in the end it gives hope .highly recommended",Boy Erased
18,zkonedog,"Uncompromising, No-Nonsense Story Of Gay Conversion Programs",8,23 November 2018,"For me to speak intelligently about the deeper issues of homosexuality is difficult considering I know very little about the topic. That being said, I do believe in personal/civil rights and am firmly rooted in the simple ""let people choose who they want to be"" philosophy of life. As such, the concept of gay conversion therapy (especially as led by fundamentalist religious figures) does not sit well with me. That feeling was further deepened upon watching ""Boy Erased"".For a basic plot summary, this film recounts the true story of Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges), a teenaged boy outed to his parents as being gay. His preacher father Marshall (Russell Crowe) and go-along to get-along mother Nancy (Nicole Kidman) somewhat cajole Jared into signing up for gay conversion therapy, ostensibly religious-based, led by Victor Sykes (Joel Edgerton). Though at first confused about his own identity and willing to give the program a try, Jared quickly discovers the utter ridiculousness and pure propaganda of the entire situation, but by then he also learns that there truly may be no end date for the length of his stay.""Boy Erased"" is the type of movie that could have easily pandered to its audience and become a sloppy cry-fest. The on-screen material truly is evocative of this type of high emotion, as some of the events/scenarios seen throughout the film are both physically and emotionally disturbing. I'm usually up for that type of high-drama filmmaking, but in this case I think I like the more speak-for-itself approach that director Edgerton takes. Only the events depicted are over-the-top in nature, not the acting, music, camera work, etc. What I'm trying to say is that this type of movie is one that could have gone for the gut punch of theatrics, but instead lets the story speak for itself.Along the same vein, and perhaps because it is based on a true story, the main plot does not play out like one might expect. Though some of the scenarios are indeed cruel, there is a strong undercurrent of hope and change running through the end of the film. Basically, it isn't a ""downer"" all the way through.Even audiences who have little to no experience with homosexuality can still enjoy this film, as at its core it really is a proxy for familial issues like religion, control, and coming-of-age. One line specifically stuck out to me, uttered by Jared's Mom: ""I love God, and I love my son. For your father, it is more complicated than that."". The fact that the parents are played by actors with such gravitas as Crowe & Kidman just add to the relatable ""every-family"" performance.Overall, ""Boy Erased"" is a solid, thoughtful film that I could see garnering some Oscar buzz as the year draws to a close. The acting is spectacular, the story is brutally honest and though-provoking (and not in a manipulative way), and the direction lets the whole piece speak for itself.",Boy Erased
19,howard.schumann,A superbly crafted film with a potent message,10,13 November 2018,"Based on the memoir by Garrard Conley and set in rural Arkansas, Australian director Joel Edgerton's (""The Gift"") Boy Erased tells the moving story of Jared Eamons (Lucas Hedges, ""Lady Bird""), an 18-year-old gay college student and his struggle for self-acceptance in the face of rejection by those whose support he desperately needs. Raised in a fundamentalist religious environment that regards same sex relationships as sinful, Jared has an uneasy relationship with his parents, mother, Nancy (Nicole Kidman, ""Destroyer"") and Dad, Marshall (Russell Crowe, ""The Nice Guys""), a Baptist preacher. When Jared is raped in college by a fellow student (Joe Alwyn, ""The Favourite"") who spitefully informs his parents, the teen is given the option of being exiled from his family or undergoing what is known as ""gay conversion therapy.""Uncertain of his own sexuality and needing his parents support, Jared acknowledges that he wants to change the behavior that he believes to be wrong and is willing to attend a 12-day conversion course that attempts to change a person's sexual orientation by using religion as a justification and coercive techniques as its method. The facility that he is sent to is called ""Love in Action"" and is run by the well-meaning but authoritarian pastor Victor Sykes (Edgerton, ""Red Sparrow""). Like a Chinese re-education camp, those enrolled must follow rigid rules such as surrendering their cell phones and turning over any notebooks they may bring. They are also not allowed to discuss the details of the program with their parents or guardians who stay at a nearby hotel.Sykes believes that homosexuality is a choice and that ""tough love"" techniques are effective in producing results. These techniques include forcing recruits to acknowledge their sinful ways and express anger towards their parents. They are also compelled to draw up a family tree showing which family members were sinful. This kind of borderline sadistic behavior is exemplified by counselor Brandon (Flea, ""Baby Driver"") who, on one occasion, prevents Jared from leaving the bathroom, calling him a ""faggot."" Using shame and physical abuse to intimidate, Sykes zeroes in on Cameron (Britton Sear, ""Unfinished Business""), a quiet, heavy-set boy who will not acknowledge his ""sins,"" bullying him by having family members beat him with a bible and immersing him in a bathtub until he nearly drowns.Fellow converts Jon (Xavier Dolan, ""Bad Times at the El Royale""), Sarah (Jesse LaTourette), and Gary (Troye Sivan, ""The Laundry,"" TV series) support the program or, in Gary's case, just tell Sykes what he wants to hear until it's time to leave. Refusing to condemn his father, however, Jared retrieves his cell phone, calls his mother to pick him up, and bolts from the facility. As the troubled teen, Hedges delivers a sensitive and nuanced performance that has encouraged Oscar talk and Crowe and Kidman provide exceptional support. While Jared is a symbol, he is also a human being and his growth from a taciturn, compliant individual to one who stands up for himself and outwardly expresses his feelings is inspiring. The most compelling scenes, however, revolve around his relationship with his parents.Edgerton is cautious about portraying Jared's dad as a villain and makes clear that the parents love for their son is real even if they have different ideas about what is best for him. In a pair of impactful scenes between Jared and each of his parents that take place four years later, Marshall realizes that a reevaluation of the ideas he has held his whole life may be necessary and Nancy moves from being a submissive echo of her husband to asserting herself not merely as a wife and mother but as a thinking individual who cannot close her eyes to the harm that is being done to her son.Much progress has been made since the time not too long ago when being gay was considered by many professionals to be a mental illness that required drastic treatments such as castration, hypnosis, or electric shock. Even though virtually every leading health organization has denounced efforts to change one's sexual orientation, and reaffirmed that attempts to do so could result in serious health risks, gay conversion therapy is still flourishing and has been banned in only fourteen states in the U.S. In addition to being a superbly crafted film, Boy Erased delivers a potent message that may help these remaining states realize that the only fix that gay people require is acceptance, support, and unconditional love.",Boy Erased
