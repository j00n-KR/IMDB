0,TheLittleSongbird,Daft yet somewhat engaging and fun movie!,8,23 October 2009,"I liked Evolution, even if it is very silly and daft on the most part. But I cannot deny it is a very fun and entertaining movie. The script has some very funny moments, there is some great camera work and some splendid scenery. Plus the creatures were superbly designed and by far the best element of the movie.The acting is perfectly acceptable, with Orlando Jones chewing up the scenery as much as he can, and Seann William Scott at his most dumbest in an appealing way. David Duchovney plays it straight. In fact my only real complaints of Evolution were although it was well constructed on the most part there are one or two slow moments in the plot, and Julianne Moore is miscast.Overall, it is daft and extremely silly to the core, but it is also very enjoyable and likable. And it never fails to give a sense of fun, no matter how daft it initially sounds. I do think this movie is very underrated, by no means perfect, but I guarantee to anyone who gives it a chance that you'll like it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Evolution
1,Leofwine_draca,Tiresome,4,19 August 2019,"EVOLUTION is a typically silly Hollywood sci-fi comedy, a film that lacks the wit and warmth of something like GALAXY QUEST and instead wastes a potentially interesting premise on a series of gross-out gags and juvenile humour. A team of mismatched heroes are brought together to battle an ever-evolving alien life form, but all this means is a near-constant battle against CGI beasties, a la MEN IN BLACK. David Duchovny stars, but there's something stand-offish about his performance that makes him unlikeable here; it's no surprise that a film career never beckoned. Julianne Moore's random slapstick comedy is quite embarrassing, and only minor players like Ted Levine and Dan Ackroyd make any kind of mark. The story goes on and on without end, and before long proves entirely tiresome.",Evolution
2,SnoopyStyle,grotesque and hilarious,8,30 January 2015,Meteor strikes Wayne Grey (Seann William Scott)'s car. Glen Canyon Community College professors Ira Kane (David Duchovny) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones) investigate. Block is working for US Geological Survey. The meteor lands in an underground cavern and they find a blue liquid coming out of the rock. Kane discovers alien life growing exponentially and evolving exponentially. Soon the military moves in led by General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine) with Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) from the CDC.It's a cross between a disturbing grotesque horror and broad comedy. It's a bit unusual because comedies aren't normally that gross. I laughed hard as I squirm in my seat. There is something disturbing and hilarious about pulling an alien fly out of Orlando Jones' backside. I like that the guys are selfish oafs. I even like the forced pratfall from Julianne Moore. This being an Ivan Reitman film. There are going to be some Ghost Busters comparisons. The creature feature is a bit too scary to be as funny as GB. However I cannot minimize how big some of the laughs got.,Evolution
3,gavin6942,"Not the Best Comedy, But It Has Enough Good Parts",6,24 April 2010,"A duo of small town college professors stumble upon a meteor with alien life present. This is great news for them, at least until they find out that the alien evolves and reproduces at a rapid rate, so much that the earth may be devoured in a matter of days.This film's strong point? David Duchovny. While the jokes are so-so and the plot is a pleasant variation of ""The Blob"", it is Duchovny that makes this film watchable. Without him, it would be easily forgettable and probably wouldn't have the underground geek following that it does. I also appreciated the brief appearance from Sarah Silverman.A few years later, the film ""Slither"" came out which once again tackles the idea of an evolving, blob-like life form. I think ""Slither"" is the better film: better effects, much more horror-oriented and still with a healthy dose of comedy. Though I wouldn't say it made ""Evolution"" entirely obsolete -- they are two distinct films with distinct charms that may appeal to different audiences.",Evolution
4,lee_eisenberg,har-har,5,15 July 2006,"When ""Evolution"" came out, many critics asserted that director Ivan Reitman had ripped off his own movie ""Ghostbusters"" and re-worked it to be about an alien invasion. Maybe there is an element of that, but the movie's mostly pretty funny (if completely absurd). Portraying a gaggle of scientists trying to explain to clueless outsiders that a meteor has brought alien life soon to multiply and take over, some parts are kind of predictable, but it's not terrible. To me at least, the only thing that weakens the movie is Ivan Reitman: I lost respect for him when I learned that he backed Arnold Schwarzenegger for California governor.Anyway, it's the sort of movie that you'll find funny if you accept any humor, no matter how low.

5,jboothmillard,Evolution,6,7 June 2006,"I didn't think much of it when it was advertised, but when I actually saw it, this is a pretty good sci-fi comedy. Basically one night practising for his fireman's exam, Wayne Grey (American Pie's Seann William Scott) sees a meteorite hit Earth. The next day Dr. Ira Kane (The X Files' David Duchovny) and Prof. Harry Phineas Block (Bedazzled's Orlando Jones) are assigned to investigate and experiment with the discovery. Then, soon enough, the government and armed forces get involved. Dr. Allison Reed, CDC (Julianne Moore) and General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine) are among the team of people in Ira and Harry's way. Soon enough, even when they can't get into the sight, things happen around the area of Navada. Also starring My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Deke, Michael Ray Bower as Danny and Dan Aykroyd as Governor Lewis. Good!",Evolution
6,Tweekums,A very funny sci-fi,8,6 June 2017,"As would be fireman Wayne Grey practices in the Arizona desert a meteorite crashed to Earth just missing him. The next day Ira Kane and Harry Block, scientists who teach at the local college arrive to investigate. They find the meteorite in an underground cavern and take samples. When these are analysed by Kane he finds that it contains alien single celled organisms by the time he can show Block they have evolved into simple multi-celled organisms. They return to the cavern for a class trip and find that s contains many worm-like creatures. The next time they return to the site it has been taken over by the army and scientist Dr. Allison Reed. It emerges that Kane was previously thrown out of the army after an experimental vaccine he developed for soldiers had some very unpleasant side effects. Refused official entry they sneak in but are caught; Block also has an unpleasant encounter with a large alien insect. It isn't long before many larger creatures evolve and a man is eaten on a golf course and a group of women are attacked in their home. At this point the creatures die after brief exposure to our atmosphere but it isn't long before they have further evolved to breathe air. It is clear that if they continue to evolve at such a rate all native life, including humanity, will be doomed something must be done to stop the creatures but will it be Kane and his friends who stop them or the army?From the opening scene it is obvious that this is going to a comedy with plenty of laughs I was laughing before the alien meteorite even arrived! The laughs continue throughout the film but not at the expense of a solid story the same plot could have been used in a more serious film; it just wouldn't have been as much fun. Given the film's PG rating some of the gags are surprisingly crude; not excessively so but some parents might think it unsuitable for younger children. The cast does a fine job, notably David Duchovny and Orlando Jones as Kane and Block as well as Julianne Moore as Dr Reed and Seann William Scott as Wayne. The special effects are very good with some great looking alien creatures impressively brought to life I particularly liked the 'cute' alien that appeared in a woman's house. Overall this film is good silly fun that fans of films such as 'Men in Black' are likely to enjoy.",Evolution
7,dbdumonteil,rather more and more regression,5,22 February 2004,"In 1984, a film-maker named Ivan Reitman made himself known thanks to a blockbuster: ""Ghostbusters"". All the hopes put in this man gradually turned out to be vain and disappointed. Indeed, you had the right to expect better than comedies with nice and harmless humor as ""Junior"" (1994) or ""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998) testified. This is not this ""Evolution"" that will make things evolve. We always stay on the same territory and Reitman is powerless to go out of the beaten tracks traced by Hollywood. The characters, the situations, the dialogs, the comic: everything is colorless, predictable, unoriginal. Moreover, ""Evolution"" is a rather dramatic story that is told on a comedy tone. Unfortunately, so many hackneyed comical effects end up wrecking any laugh even any interest. Reitman was about 54 years old when he made this movie. He'd better retire.",Evolution
8,Quinoa1984,Another hit for Reitman,6,8 June 2001,"Ivan Reitman's Evolution follows his most famous film, Ghostbusters in the type of formula, but it is not that movie (especially since it's one of the funniest films ever).  But Evolution still is a worthy summer comedy, filled with funny in joke puns and jabs at aliens and a very, very likeable cast. The best gag though in the movie, and I think it's one of the few comic gem scenes in the past year and a half, is a scene where Orlando Jones (who hold most of the films funniest one liners) has a weird Mosquito alien crawling inside of him, where some of the funniest dialogue in a Reitman movie including the following ""There's no time for lubricant"" ""There's ALWAYS time for lubricant"" and ""What type of ice cream do you want"" ""It don't matter, it's for my ass.""  Even Dan Aykroyd has fun in a role that almost seems like a take off of the mayor character from his prodigy Ghostbusters.  Kudos to pretty much everyone; Tippet gets big props (as always) for his ingenious alien creations.  A-",Evolution

They are joined by clumsy Julianne Moore (as Allison Reed); she falls down, bumps into things, and provides Mr. Duchovny (and the film) with love interest.

10,michaelRokeefe,Biology can be dangerous to your health.,3,29 November 2002,"This movie may have had something redeemable if it was not presented as a comedy. A very good idea just seems to melt into itself in order to pass for trash. Two college professors(David Duchovny and Orlando Jones)have their microbiology backgrounds tested when an alien life-form oozes out of a meteor and starts evolving in the Arizona desert. Actually some very good F/X, but wasted on such a flick. Also wasted is the talent of Julianne Moore. Seann William Scott playing a clueless firefighting cadet is hard to ignore. And Dan Aykroyd is the dim witted Governor willing to have his state nuked. A far cry from say TREMORS that managed some how to pull off blending comedy with Sci-Fi.",Evolution
11,hitchcockthelegend,Lubricant and the giant product placement.,7,17 June 2009,"A meteorite falls to Earth and lands right in the desert at Glen Canyon, Arizona. Two college professors, Dr. Ira Kane and Prof. Harry Phineas Block, take it upon themselves to investigate and mooch around. At the site, they discover worm like insects that are not of this world. Thinking they are on to Nobel Prize type history, they are dismayed when the government takes over the site and shunts them out the way. But as the insects start to evolve in the Earth atmosphere, they take on various shapes and forms of alien creatures. Pretty soon the whole place is over run and the government is at a loss in how to stop them. Enter Ira, Harry, Wayne and Allison to hopefully save the day.Directed by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters 1 & 2), Evolution is a zany sci-fi comedy that achieves firmly what it sets out to do. Using the available special effects for great rewards, and lashing it in Technicolor, all that remained was to have a cast happy to be in on the joke itself. Up step David Duchovny (revelling in none serious X Files malarkey), Orlando Jones (getting all the best lines), Julianne Moore (accident prone) and Sean Wiillian Scott (goofball fireman wannabe). Backed up by Ted Levine, Dan Ackroyd, Ethan Suplee and Ty Burrell, pic is well served right across the cast list. Of course they aren't asked to do anything special, but it's not that kind of film. There's enough here for all the family to enjoy, kids will be awed by the array of alien creatures, whilst the adults should be chuckling away at some of the jokes.If you are expecting real science then you have come to the wrong place, Evolution parodies the sci-fi parodies, and then some. 7/10",Evolution
12,jotix100,Who you're going to call? Creaturesbusters!,6,23 February 2009,"Never saw this movie in its original release, but we recently caught it thanks to a cable network. Ivan Reitman, the director of the more successful ""Ghostbusters"" must love the genre. Otherwise, it's hard to imagine what attracted him to this far fetched tale of mutant creatures that come into themselves after two naive geologists from a nearby community college, Ira Kane and Harry Block, decided to take chunks of a meteorite that landed in the Arizona desert. The result of their experiment bring horrible consequences for the nearby city.Ira Kane discovers in his microscope the ability of the liquid taken from the space rock to mutate into million cells rapidly. Suddenly strange reptile-like creatures begin to appear. That is when the Pentagon decides to send the misguided General Woodman to the site to take over the investigation. The only positive thing in the arriving force is Allison Reed, who soon after the arrival realizes the big problem posed by the creatures that begin appearing all over the place.""Evolution"" turns out to be fun for a while, but it is just another predictable movie that in the end relies on special effects, but no real smarts. One thing though, the creatures designed by Phil Tippet are perfectly creepy and menacing. The best sequence of the entire film has to be a fly-like monster that enters the skin of Harry Block and one sees it move under it. The creature moves all over his body under the skin and we watch its shape perfectly. The only way this thing out is to go through a part of his anatomy and involves the use of a device that is too painful to describe. David Duchovny and Orlando Bloom do a good job with their roles. Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott don't have much to do. Ted Levine is perfectly oily and menacing. Dan Aykroyd has a small part as the governor of Arizona.",Evolution
13,Scarecrow-88,Evolution,6,21 February 2016,"Goofy sci-fi spoof set in an Arizona community college desert town has two scientists (David Duchovny and Orlando Bloom) discovering a variety of alien lifeforms evolving into scary monsters at an alarming rate, deciding it would be best to kill them before the extinction of the human race. How to do that? Head and Shoulders shampoo, of course! Duchovny gets to riff his X-Files image and is comfortably relaxed as a ladies' man with a rather unfortunate history regarding his work at the Pentagonwhich a former associate, General Woodman (Ted Levine; Silence of the Lambs, Monk), likes to remind him of. Bloom coaches girl basketball, must endure a rectal removal of an alien ""fly"", and seems to be having fun as Duchovny's wise-cracking sidekickcertainly hard to forget is how Bloom is literally sucked into the anus of a giant alien monster! Seann William Scott, obviously cast due to his Stiffler character from the American Pie movies of the time, is a fireman wannabe who assists the scientists in trying to stop the aliens from evolving into a menace that would destroy all of mankind. Julianne Moore is another military scientist that eventually sides with Duchovny and Bloom after initially being on the side of Levine. Dan Aykroyd is the Arizona governor and Sarah Silverman is a former lover of Duchovny's. As you might expect, Moore and Duchovny (Moore being a redhead has a special irony to it, considering Gillian Anderson was opposite Duchovny on the X-Files) eventually hit it off. The obvious ending Ghost Busters homage is hard not to notice. Some cool special effects giving life to the aliens add substantially to the spoof; this might make a fun companion piece to Mars Attacks. The comedy aims to please and perhaps tries just a bit too hard, but I guess it succeeds more than fails. I thought William Scott was rather inconsequential to the film, lightening up his usual shtick and offering a rather dimbulb bimbo who is all gung-ho to help the scientists. A type of winged dinosaur flying through a mall could be the special effects highlight, but there is an underground cavern that becomes its own alien world which gives it a run for its money. Moore was about to move on from this kind of movie to focus on far more dramatic work. Bloom's asking for his leg to be removed before the fly inside his body reaches his testicles should get a good laugh. There's plenty of winking in Duchovny's performance which signifies that he (nor us should) doesn't take this seriously at all.",Evolution
14,Hey_Sweden,Better than expected.,7,28 September 2020,"A meteor crashes to Earth in the Arizona desert. It turns out that it's oozing very primitive life forms that take almost no time in evolving into bigger, more advanced, and deadlier predatory aliens. Two community college science teachers, Ira (David Duchovny), and Harry (Orlando Jones), are first to make the discovery. Soon, they are getting pushed aside by an aggressive military led by condescending General Woodman (Ted Levine). But Ira and Harry work with a government scientist (Julianne Moore), a goofy wannabe fireman (Seann William Scott), and two of Ira's students to foil what promises to be a full-scale alien invasion.Don't expect anything in terms of real-world type logic and you can have a pretty good time with this one. It's pure science-fantasy, and while one could easily accuse veteran filmmaker Ivan Reitman of trying to relive his ""Ghost Busters"" glory here, there are a pleasant amount of laughs and thrills to enjoy. ""Evolution"" is loud, boisterous, and features some absolutely great creatures. Veteran effects man Phil Tippett was the main visual effects supervisor, so you do expect (and get) a degree of quality and imagination. Not all of the CGI is created equal, but in general, there are some fun visuals to entertain the viewer. The alien ecosystem that develops inside the crater is one such example. Excellent location shooting and a bombastic John Powell music score help to make this a good watch, even if it's not as memorable as ""Ghost Busters"", and not destined to be nearly as iconic.The actors are a delight, with Duchovny getting another chance to show off his comedic chops. Adding to that is the fact that his is a character in need of some redemption and validation. The lovely Ms. Moore likewise endears herself as a character with a potential to be klutzy at times. Jones is lively and engaging, and has one of the best lines in the picture. Scott doesn't have to stretch himself too much, although he does come up with a highly unlikely method of attracting the attention of an enormous flying reptile. A steady parade of familiar faces in supporting roles (including Dan Aykroyd as the governor) is another asset.Overall, ""Evolution"" is amiable fun, with a decent script by David Diamond, David Weissman, and Don Jakoby, and assured direction by Reitman.Seven out of 10.",Evolution
15,poolandrews,Really great sci-fi fun.,8,2 December 2007,"Evolution is set in the Arizona town of Glenn Canyon where two scientists Dr. Ira Kane (David Duchovny) & Professor Harry Block (Orlando Jones) who lecture at the local university investigate a meteorite that has fallen in the desert nearby, they find it in some old caves & take some samples. The results are startling as Kane discovers an alien life form which can evolve & adapt at an amazing rate, soon the Army becomes aware of the meteorite & takes control of the situation as a whole mini alien eco-system is growing at a tremendous rate in the caves. As the strange alien creatures within begin to find their way to the local town a way must be found to stop them before they take over the entire planet...Co-produced & directed by Ivan Reitman I think Evolution is one of the best sci-fi comedies I've ever seen & for that I apologise to no-one. The script by Don Kakoby, David Diamond & David Weissman originally started out as a straight forward & serious sci-fi thriller film but once Reitman came on-board he developed the comedic aspects which makes one think he wanted to do another Ghostbusters (1984) which is easily his best & most successful film to date. Anyway, it has a definite Ghostbusters feel in it's deadpan humour & slimy monsters everywhere but Evolution is a great film in it's own right. For a start Evolution is surprisingly funny, I find a lot of Hollywood comedies to be moronic but Evolution works really well & the light hearted script has a nice balance between the humour & more serious sci-fi side of things. The film is quite epic in scope with a whole town being overrun by alien monsters & an entire alien eco-system trying to take over which I think I might be right in saying is an original concept, can you think of another film that uses it? I thought the idea in itself was clever & keeps all manner of alien beasties coming thick & fast. The character's are also very likable, Duchovny & Jones as the two scientists in particular have good chemistry & work well against each other with Duchovny's deadpan delivery & Jones' more eccentric performance. It moves along like a rocket, the alien meteorite crashes to Earth during the opening credits sequence & from that point the film never lets up. A class film, if there is anything to dislike about Evolution I haven't discovered it. Forget about the obligatory 'this is the worst film I've ever seen' threads on the IMDb message board, every film ever made seems to have one.Director Reitman does a great job, he keeps things moving along nicely & he handles the special effects scenes well. The effects are a mixture of puppet & on set creature effects which are brilliant & the expected CGI computer effects which are also top drawer, it just goes to show if you have literally millions of dollars to spend on your effects then you can achieve some spectacular results. From flying reptilian Dragon like aliens to living plants to alien spiders to alien fish to a huge gigantic walking blob at the end, all the aliens look fantastic & are a nice mixture of the cute & the creepy. I liked the ending too, the way they wanted to be celebrities & as such ended up doing commercials.With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 Evolution was a well funded film & it show's, it looks great with fantastic special effects & spectacular alien monsters. The acting is good from the main cast, I admit I've never liked Julianne Moore in anything I've ever seen her in but she's tolerable in this. To to reinforce the Ghostbusters theme Dan Aykroyd has a funny cameo at the end as the state Governor.Evolution is a brilliant sci-fi comedy & it's as simple & straight forward as that, I loved it. Again this is just my opinion because there's plenty of 'this is the worst film ever' type posts on the IMDb but I honestly think it's a fantastic film from start to finish in just about every respect. Followed by the Saturday morning cartoon series Alienators: Evolution Continues (2001) which ran for 26 episodes & features both Ira Kane & Harry Block.",Evolution
16,zardoz-13,"Sci-fi comedy takes several steps backward with ""Evolution.""",2,10 July 2007,"My totally negative critical opinion of director Ivan Reitman's ""Evolution"" has nothing to do with Charles Darwin. This sophomoric aliens-vs.-humans comedy with ""X-Files"" defector David Duchovny battling carnivorous extraterrestrials never evolves beyond its amoebic humor, its cretinous characters, and its Petri dish deep plot. Indeed, campy 1950s B-movie sci-fi classics, like ""The Giant Gila Monster"" or ""The Killer Shrews,"" deliver more laughs per minute than this feeble, uninspired potboiler. Okay, some of the gross-out gags may prompt a snicker, but you won't split your sides howling with hilarity like you might have done at Reitman's original ""Ghostbusters."" Imagine a ""Ghostbusters"" trio of heroes combating aliens gone AWOL from ""Men In Black,"" ""Tremors,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and you have a fairly accurate idea how wholly derivative and hopelessly predictable this lame creature feature is. Basically, Reitman stages these life and death exploits as if they constituted multi-million dollar ""Saturday Night Live"" skits.The prefabricated screenplay by Don (""Vampires"") Jakoby, David (""The Family Man"") Diamond, & David Weissman opens one night when goofy firefighter wannabe, Wayne Green (Sean William Scott of ""American Pie""), sets an empty shack ablaze in the desert and practices his rescue routine with a life-sized female dummy. Suddenly, a fiery meteor plunges from the heavens, obliterates the shack, hurls Wayne's car two hundred feet into the sky, and crashes out-of-sight in a cavern! Duchovny stars as Professor Ira Kane, a disgraced ex-Army scientist now teaching biology at Glen Canyon Community College in Arizona. It seems the Pentagon gave Ira the boot after platoons of troops contracted dire side effects like diarrhea, blindness, facial paralysis, and hair loss when he inoculated them. Meanwhile, Kane's colleague Professor Harry Block (Orlando Jones) divides his time between geology lectures and coaching the girls' volleyball team. Kane and Block gather asteroid samples. Staring into a microscope, an alarmed Kane watches these single-cell organisms evolve at an unearthly rate. Kane tells Block: ""What took us 200 million years has taken them only a few hours."" Without warning, the U.S. Army commandeers the investigation, banishes our protagonists from the premises, confiscates their research, and summons attractive CDC epidemiologist Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore of ""Hannibal"") who has a clumsy habit of falling down wherever she walks. Gradually, the slimy creatures acclimate themselves to Earth's ecosystem and behave like predators. Despicable Army General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine of ""Silence of the Lambs"") decides to napalm them. Unfortunately, our heroes learn too late these monsters react to napalm like Gremlins to bathing after midnight.Not only does David Duchovny lack Bill Murray's comedic genius, but also he cannot pass up any opportunity to spoof his Agent Mulder persona. Meanwhile, Orlando Jones of ""Bedazzled"" suffers a far worse fate. He submits reluctantly to an anal probe when an alien burrows under his skin, then later finds himself administering a shampoo enema to a gargantuan monster to destroy it! ""Evolution"" really hits rock bottom with its shameless product placement for ""Head & Shoulders!Sci-fi comedy takes several steps backward with ""Evolution.""",Evolution
17,Boba_Fett1138,Fun movie to watch.,6,30 September 2005,"This movie is nothing more than just simple plain fun. Still there isn't much story present which causes the movie to leave a bit of a pointless impression afterward. This movie is nothing memorable or anything but it still is entertaining and fun to watch, for at least once.Perhaps the best thing about ""Evolution"" are the two main characters played by David Duchovny and Orlando Jones, who have a great on-screen chemistry together. It's really believable in the movie that they have been friends for years. Another thing that is great about this movie is the sharp and fun dialog.David Duchovny really plays excellent in this movie. He was criticized a lot I remember, when this movie was just released but that had everything to do with the fact that people had a hard time seeing him playing a character different than Fox Mulder from ""The X-Files"". It's too bad that Julliane Moore doesn't have a big comical talent and Seann William Scott plays a bit of a perhaps needless and just pointless character.The story really isn't about much and that is the main reason why ""Evolution"" doesn't quite work as a movie, at least not as a successful one. The movie is very forgettable and leaves a pointless impression afterward.The movie is nicely looking and has some above average special effects in it. The musical score by John Powell is surprising good and perhaps a bit underrated.A movie that is entertaining and fun to watch, at least once but no must see by any means.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The longest Head and Shoulders commercial ever...,3,29 October 2004,"This movie is pretty much just a remake/update of Ghostbusters, with aliens instead of ghosts. This pretty much proves that director Ivan Reitman can't really do anything but this type of films. The plot is stupid and poorly paced. The acting is pretty decent, but that's also the only good thing about this film. The characters are all clichés and stereotypes. Most of the actors portray pretty much the exact same type of character that they usually do, so I don't know how much it really took for the actors to get into character or act their parts. The humor is childish, cheesy and juvenile throughout. The special effects look hideous. The science fiction elements are poor. The whole thing is just so throughly unfunny and dull that it's hard to put into words. It's boring and cheesy, never particularly funny and never engaging, exciting or interesting. I doubt anyone but the biggest of fans of Reitman or the actors involved would find this even marginally interesting. The whole thing about the shampoo in the end was so stupid I could actually feel my IQ dropping drastically. So, in conclusion, if you are a fan of the newer, apparently popular, one-note childish, juvenile crude humor as seen on shows like Family Guy and (sadly) recent episodes of The Simpsons, look no further... or, maybe, look further, as even that type of humor is better in other films... but, anyway, if you aren't, stay away. Far away. I recommend this to big fans of Reitman or the various actors, and of the aforementioned type of humor. 3/10",Evolution
19,Wizard-8,Blandly made by everyone involved,3,27 June 2020,"It's obvious that producer/director Ivan Reitman was hoping to recapture the magic of his earlier hit movie ""Ghostbusters"" with this movie, but unfortunately the results this time around are a real disappointment. From what I heard, the original version of the screenplay was written in a serious vein, but someone along the line decided that it should be made as a comedy. It's not much of a surprise that the comedy here seems extremely shoehorned in here instead of coming across as natural and belonging to this particular cinematic environment. It might have been okay had this forced-in comedy been funny, but it simply isn't. It's both extremely predictable and without any big spark to it. This may explain why the cast doesn't seem particularly enthusiastic, giving passive performances from the beginning to the end. The movie doesn't even have any good eye candy; the special effects, even for the period this movie was made in, are really below average for a big budget Hollywood movie. They come across as really phony and unnatural. You'd be a lot better off rewatching ""Ghostbusters"" instead.",Evolution

David Duchovny plays a biology teacher and Orlando Jones plays a girls' volleyball coach who answer a call to the site where a meteor landed. A sample indicates that there is an organism evolving at an alarming rate. They are sabotaged when scientists take them to court to gain possession of the research. Although the solution is clever the plot is recycled and dull. It seems that director Ivan Reitman is trying to relive the success of Ghostbusters and failing miserably. Duchovny is basically playing his X-Files role while Jones spouts one-liners as if he was auditioning for a nightclub gig. Julianne Moore serves no purpose than to play the woman. She doesn't even get slimed when things get unbelievably messy. Seann William Scott who opens the film, becomes unnecessary from each passing moment. The special effects will remind viewers of Ghostbusters and while the effects here are good, they are not accompanied with a story worth evolving into a movie to begin with.

A couple of community college teachers (Orlando Jones and David Duchovny) deal with some aliens that evolve after a meteor crashes into Earth.David Duchovny is alright. Interesting to see Julianne Moore in a comedic role - she often doesn't do them. Sean William Scott is his usual dumb character role. Interesting to see a pre weight loss Ethan Suplee.Some of the jokes aren't funny but about half of them are so it's worth a watch.,Evolution
22,SimonJack,Monsters and Moore are the humor here,6,21 September 2015,"""Evolution"" won't leave one rolling in the aisles with laughter, or even chuckling that much. The plot is simple and will seem very familiar. There's nothing special about the script or acting. But it is a fun movie, mostly on two scores. The first is the bumbling and fumbling that Julianne Moore's character, Allison does. The usually serious Moore adds something to this film in her unusual straight-faced clumsiness.The second thing that boosts the film to above boredom is the monster, or monsters. The sci-fi aspects of ""Evolution"" are excellent. The special effects and/or CGI in this film are very good. It's not a scary movie, but one of those sort of tongue-in-cheek sci-fi action films. The terror or fright of a serious sci-fi film is replaced here by a bemusing humor at the antics and attacks of the creatures. Indeed, those will get more laughs than the lame lines of the two male lead characters, Ira and Harry. I wouldn't run out and buy this film, but it's worth watching if it plays on TV or if one can find it somewhere for a few bucks.",Evolution
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,Who was this film meant for?,2,3 November 2005,"I finally finished Evolution, after falling asleep to it like 5 times. I'm not sure who this film was meant for. It had high school type of science with elementary/junior high humor. I'm not sure yet, but I don't think I liked this movie at all. There were a couple parts I kind of went ""hmph"" in a laughing matter, but nothing that deserves a 5.8 rating on IMDb. What's with that by the way? I mean I see pretty decent movies on IMDb that are low, I mean like cute little comedies like Mannequin or Simply Irresistible that just make you feel good at the end. But somehow ""Evolution"" got a 5.8? I'd just like to know how? It's really not that good of a movie. If this was from ""X-Files"" fans, wow. I really hope it's not, because there are more deserving movies of a higher rating. This has no structure, good acting, or actual comedy to it.

25,sddavis63,What A Mess!,2,29 March 2003,"The really unforgivable thing about this movie is that if it had been treated seriously it had some real potential to be a good movie. Unfortunately, director Ivan Reitman chose to treat it not so much as a comedy, but as a cartoon - and not a particularly funny one at that. What we ended up with were one dimensional characters, none of whom were very interesting, and a couple of big names (David Duchovny and Julianna Moore) who surely must have done this for the money because they didn't really seem to throw a lot of effort into it.Too bad. It really was an interesting premise. Alien micro-organisms crash to earth and begin to evolve at fantastic rates. There might have been the opportunity for some interesting takes on evolution, and the potential for human-alien and inter-species communication and it could still have been done as a comedy. But I just didn't feel that it was well put together, I certainly didn't find it funny, and the gaps in logic were too much. In short - I thought the thing was a mess.2/10",Evolution
26,cherold,"Sometimes entertaining, always stupid",6,4 September 2013,"I'm sure between the time of the two Ghostbusters movies and the time Ivan Reitman made Evolution, a lot of people had told him he should make another movie like Ghostbusters. In theory, they were correct, but his attempt to do so is largely a failure.The premise is a clever one. An alien substance has landed on earth and begins to evolve at an incredible rate, going from goo to flatworms to dinosaurs to apes in a matter of days. The best part of the movie is the creature design, which is really impressive.The movie focuses on a couple of college science teachers who investigate this substance.The first thing to note is that these teachers handle this very badly, even though the movie doesn't seem to think so. They don't seem to recognize the danger of a rapidly evolving substance out in the wild for quite a while, irresponsibly telling no one, so when others interfere, I failed to feel the sort of outrage one normally is expected to feel when the heroes lose control of something. In this case, that's exactly what should have happened.The illogic of the script goes beyond the stupidity of the teachers. A central plot point relies on the army to have not done one of the first scientific tests that any idiot would do with an alien substance. Meanwhile, another scientist, played by Julianne Moore, is established early on as clumsy. The problem is, this in no way defines or establishes the character nor is it particularly funny, so it feels like a pointless addition, as though the writers realized that she wasn't very interesting and decided to give her a random quirk.The movie also concerns a wannabe firefighter, and his presence is as extraneous as Moore's clumsiness. He appears to be in the movie only because there were three ghostbusters so Reitman wanted three alien- busters. But you could excise him from the film without losing much of anything.While sometimes amusing and filled with cool visual effects, this movie is constructed so poorly that it never achieves any momentum. Ultimately it is what happened when Ghostbusters devolved.",Evolution

28,bowmanblue,Probably better than it deserves to be,7,13 September 2017,"Did you ever see or hear something and then found that, for ever after, it's impossible to UNhear it? I'll explain I watched 'Evolution' in the cinema and enjoyed it. Then, some time after, I read a review that stated 'It's simply 'Ghostbusters' with aliens.' Now, every time I watch it, all I can see are the parallels between the two films. However, that's no bad thing, as, no matter how apt that summary may be, the film is still good fun. For some reason.David Duchovny took a break from playing 'Fox Mulder' in the ever-popular 'X-Files' in order to film this other 'alien invasion' movie. However, just because he left his FBI badge with Scully, didn't mean that Mulder isn't here in spirit. I know he's attracted more than his fair share of criticism directed at his acting ability (or lack thereof) and I don't want to add to such negativity (as I am a fan, after all!). However, he really just seems to be playing a non-FBI Mulder, only with slightly tinted blond highlights in his hair. In 'Evolution' he plays a scientist who works in a university in the desert, only to discover than a meteorite crashes nearby, containing microscopic alien life forms. Unfortunately, they don't stay that way for long and soon they're threatening to have the locals on toast. So, 'not Mulder' teams up with a couple of other scientists, plus a fireman-in-training to combat this alien menace.'Not Mulder's' fellow scientist is played by black actor Orlando Jones. I only mention his race because he spends much of the movie spouting jokes based on black/white differences. Then there's the government scientist played by Julianne Moore. She's also 'Not Mulder's' love interest and spends most of her time falling over or bumping into things. Comedy gold, eh? Finally, you have 'Stiffler' from the 'American Pie' franchise as the amateur fireman. I won't even bother using the actor's name as he's effectively Stiffler who can drive a fire engine. And, just like 'Ghostbusters' our quartet don't just have aliens to worry about, but an inept military/Government agency who are also apparently hell-bent on impeding their efforts.Now, you may think I'm sounding rather negative regarding a film that I claim to enjoy. I guess I am. There is nothing here that's particularly clever or original. And yet I still enjoy it. I've actually thought long and hard about why I still continue to watch 'Evolution' and I've concluded that the simple answer is that it never tries too hard. If it tried to be deep and meaningful, it would be an abject failure. In the same way that if it tried to be an action movie it would fail. The same goes if it went for a straight comedy. As it is, it's enough of all those genres just to pass itself off as light entertainment. It'll never really win any awards or be remembered as anything other than a sort of Ghostbusters-with-aliens clone, but if you like David Duchovny, or silly light-hearted sci-fi in general, put this on – it's the kind of movie you don't have to think too deeply about and can dip in and out of and still get a nice warm feeling of enjoyment out of.",Evolution
29,dromasca,A Good Science Fiction Comedy?,7,27 October 2001,"Is there such a thing? I do not have a definite answer to this question after having seen this movie. While science fiction literature has produced some remarkable names (Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett) which write something that is simultaneously good literature, science fiction or fantasy and goo humor - I still have to see a good movie that gets the three in one.David Duchovny is good, playing on the lower key of some of the X-Files appearances. The script is not bad but there are too many standard characters acted in standard way and filmed in a standard manner. If you happen to be around, and you can afford easily the tickets and the popcorn, you will not regret probably. Otherwise, do not plan a trip just to see this film.",Evolution

That's like the worst plot that they ever came up with. Involving Seann William Scott was a bad idea joining this since he always makes dirty jokes, we all know that from him being involved with American Pie!I would love if this movie did not exist, it would avoid me even touching it!",Evolution
31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Just plain fun,6,7 May 2004,"It's clear that as long as Ivan Reitman works in sci-fi comedy he will never achieve the greatness he did with Ghostbusters. That movie was a masterpiece of genius. Evolution is nothing but a fun ride that comes nowhere near the class of Ghostbusters. But it's still well worth it.Weird really when you consider that Ghostbusters: Go to Hell, the second sequel in which hell got so full that spirits started spilling out into the real world, was re-written and redrafted that it became this...something completely different. You probably know the story. A meteor crash lands in the desert and the single celled organisms living on it very, very quickly become multi celled and then little worm creatures and then...many other things. The movie repeatedly calls them aliens but since they evolve from nothing on earth and are conditioned by earth's environment they are, effectively, earth creatures. Watching them run riot and cause havoc is the main fun of this film.Ghostbusters had a dry, sarcastic sense of humor, like a fine wine. Evolution has a crude, gross-out sense of humor like American Pie, which seriously lessens the overall quality of the film. The lead trio of actors perform rather well together. Duchovny is much looser and easy-going here than his stiff, X-Files character. Seann William-Scott once again plays a dufus but he's more endearing here than he has been in other roles. Orlando Jones is kind of good but he too often takes his role in the stereotyped 'only black guy in a white movie' direction. Sadly though, Julianne Moore's accident-prone scientist just isn't funny and her clumsiness seems false and forced.But obviously when you judge Evolution next to something better it seems an inferior movie. Judge it on it's own terms and you'll definitely enjoy. The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (though it really could have benefited from a scope 2.35:1 aspect ratio) and is in rather lacklustre Dolby 5.1",Evolution

I didn't think is was a comedy as the trailers had first made it out to be and it seemed pretty weak and disturbing with its humor mixed in with a rather harsh, serious undercurrent of monster horror. As I've continued to watch subsequent viewings of Evolution, I've come to appreciate the movie for what it is. Instead of a relatively light-weight, entertaining hilarious comedy, Evolution is more of a dry humor, characteristic of David Duchovny and similar in tone to the wry humor in Lake Placid (1999) where Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda are confronted with a monstrous allegator menacing the populace of Lake Placid.

35,Floated2,Over the top silly and gross out humor,2,14 July 2020,"Evolution is relatively a simple story and plot wise film. Nothing spectacular or quite interesting of note. The comedy is rather bland and just far too over the top. The lead characters aren't exactly likeable and are generic. Although Seann William Scott steals his scenes as he was the highlight for one.Too much gross out content (from the aliens explosions and such). At first it was fine but as it continued, it became too much. The film does offer an interesting concept but the story doesn't take off as much as it should have. And the aliens weren't appealing to look at. Overall it felt like a mess.With a surprisingly large budget of $80 million and only making $98 million worldwide, Evolution was quite a flop. One reason one thinks is the lead actor David Duchovny wasn't a big enough name draw to bring in an audience. This role was more suited for an A-list actor like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. The other obvious reason is the film wasn't great.",Evolution
36,johnnyboyz,Occasionally smart and funny but doesn't evolve into anything great.,5,13 October 2007,"Evolution is one of those films that, cleverly at times, mixes in humour and comedy with a scary concept to combine it with horror in a very juxtaposed sense. Director Ivan Reitman made Ghostbusters about twenty years before he made Evolution and although it's been a while since I saw Ghostbusters, I can remember enough to suggest that Evolution sorts of feels like a 21st Century version of the now rather iconic, albeit for puzzling reasons, Ghostbusters.Evolution is fast, fun and sort of dumb but it knows it is. It uses some of the oldest ways of both telling a story and how to present characters to the audience; what I'm getting at here is the 'buddy' combination which was very popular and rather successful during the 1980s, coincidentally round about the time Ghostbusters was proving to be such a hit. What I liked about this reference or perhaps 'spoof' at times is that Evolution recognises what it's doing: The white guy named Ira Kane (Duchovny) and the black guy named Harry Block (Jones) are the two protagonists combining for the duration and Block consistently references the way the buddy genre works giving a very post-modern feel to the film. He states that he's 'seen this movie: the black guy dies first' when faced with a could-be dangerous situation; he also falls foul of most of the jokes in the film: The flying bug just happens to get into HIS costume; he has the job of going up the massive alien's anus in order to fulfil the goal and of course, there's never enough time for lubricant whenever the coloured guy's on the operating table  typical.Evolution seemed to have a plan and it stuck to it throughout. The film is a comedy but it's also a rather frightening horror film in the sense we see so many nasty things happen that it's tempting to look away out of knowledge that we have no idea how bad the consequences might be. When that flying bug gets into Block's suit and we see it 'inside' him, it's grim but funny; likewise when that monster comes out of 'a water hazard of the fourth green', grabs a sexually active character and drags him back into the water, it's pretty grim but it's funny because he leaves grassy trails with his fingernails along the pristine putting green: a post-modern touch as it looks like it's straight out of a Tom & Jerry cartoon.Evolution is at its core, a comedy because there aren't as many 'scary' moments once the film's narrative is developed into something more serious. The whole idea about visitors from outer space is appealing and fun with the speedy growth the aliens make also interesting as well as unpredictable: I got the reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey when they mutated into primitive men and were suddenly hostile. Unfortunately, Evolution becomes a very tired film when it enters its final thirty-five minutes or so. There is an amusing if not anti-climatic scene in a shopping mall involving a creature that's a cross between a raptor dinosaur and an eagle that has no bearing on anything what-so-ever and Allison Reed's (Moore) quote about how 'as soon as they (the aliens) take America, we're extinct' is basically two fingers up at every other military any other country has which was disappointing. If Evolution was a house of cards then this quote is the jolt that causes it to sort of collapse a little: the 'race against time' is tired and familiar, the plot point written on the back of someone's T-shirt is bizarre and the whole product placement of a certain shampoo leaves a hell of a lot to be desired.Despite this; Evolution is a good film for what it is exploring some themes such as greed and envy and whether or not if extra terrestrials did land here, how much would it be worth to keep quiet? It's sort of funny, sort of scary and sort of clever but many people will consider this film to be a complete waste of time.",Evolution

In a desperately obvious bid to recreate the magic of Ghostbusters, Reitman tries to trade in Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis & Hudson with Duchovny, Jones, Scott & Moore.

39,Anonymous_Maxine,A worthwhile comedy thanks to Orlando Jones.,7,15 January 2003,"We all know Orlando Jones as the endlessly amusing 7-Up guy, but in Evolution he is given a full-length role and the opportunity to show the world how funny he can be. Here is an enormously underrated actor who steals the show even when he's not onscreen, so we can only hope to see a lot more of him in the future. David Duchovny is perfectly cast as the geology professor at the local city college who is on the scene to investigate a mysterious asteroid that has landed on earth and seems to have brought with it some astonishingly quickly growing and evolving organisms from an unknown origin. His history from the X-Files gives him the perfect mixture of seriousness since he just has that voice that makes anything he's talking about sound mysterious and other-worldly, and at the same time it gives him a great opportunity to make some nice inside jokes about his iconography (`I don't trust the government, I know those people.').Julianne Moore is the place where the movie really trips up. She is a tremendously talented actor, and is given a role that is immensely below her. She is there literally for no other reason than to have a love interest for Dr. Kane (Duchovny) and so that she can, for some reason, trip and fall flat on her face for some completely unknown reason every once in a while in the movie. Seann William Scott, the single reason to watch crapfests like the American Pies and Road Trip, is given a role that reduces him to goofball comic relief spouting bad jokes (`That's like a big loogie!') that are funny almost not a single time in the film. This guy was side-splittingly hilarious in some of his previous films, even the bad ones (which was most of them), and he is a hugely talented comedy actor, but he just had nothing to work with here. Maybe they should have let him write his own part.The aliens themselves are remarkably interesting, given the way they grow and evolve at such an alarming rate and the things that they grow into. There is a lot of creativity there, even though a lot of it goes way over the top and there are occasional special effects that are just not convincing enough. The idea of having the aliens being unable to tolerate oxygen was a good one, because when aliens are introduced from another world, you can't just have them running around killing people, there have to be some rules that the humans can work with in fighting them so that they're not just freaky looking bad guys. An intolerance of our atmosphere gives them character and gives the humans an edge. The way that they conducted experiments (purposely or otherwise) to see what killed the aliens was some of the more interesting parts of the movie, although their weapon against the biggest baddest aliens at the end of the film was a little too goofy, even for a movie like this.Evolution is a very rare kind of film, placing itself among very few colleagues in a genre almost entirely its own, the science fiction comedy. It has the cast to create this kind of film successfully, but some of them, mainly Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott, are simply misused and do not fulfill their entire potential. If a little more work had been put into their roles, the movie could have been immeasurably better.",Evolution

42,hellraiser7,Evolutionary Trouble,9,30 November 2020,"This is an under the radar gem that I really like. The real shame about this film was that it never had the chance to become a franchise there really was a lot of potential; I personally would of liked to of seen a sequel see this ensemble kick some more alien ass. Though there actually was an animated series after the film which you could say is the sequel and was surprising, good and another under the radar gem. Would've been cool if there was some comic book follow up series to this film from ""Dark Horse"" or ""IDW"", what a shame.I like the plotline which is obvious a throwback and slight homage to 50's sci fi film as their film always featured something that came from out of space to our planet. Let alone the fact it's always aimed at the desert locations, in this film it's Arizona.Yeah, it's not a new premise as it's another film in the ""Alien Invasion"" category of the sci-fi genre, but it's in the execution that makes it stand out. The one thing about this unique are the aliens are ones that evolve at a rapid and unpredictable rate which makes them dangerous; basically like throwing and rolling a handful of RPG dice you never know what will turn up.Music is good if nothing that really stand out in my book but a good listen and fits the film. The effects are very solid, most of it done by one of my favorite effect's artists the late great Phil Tipit. I like how there is mix of both practical and CGI effects, the effects hold up especially the CGI effects as there actually done right. Well ok, bits of CGI effects may come off a bit dated but this film was made in the 2000 decade so what are you going to do, but those are details that are hardly noticeable and due to the amount of fun I have with the film I didn't much care.I really like the creative number of creatures in the film, it's a shame there wasn't a toy line for them based on this film. There are so many otherworldly and strange creatures throughout the movie from some dog like monster that looks harmless and cute but of course if you've seen enough sci-fi and horror films you already know they really aren't. A flying dragon like creature, a brutal white ape man, and plenty more alien creature feature.The characters ensemble are really solid along with the humor are both the factors that really power the film, their all the typical underdog ensemble which is all the more why I like them and in movies like this are always the best bets to save your life. There isn't really much to any action in the film, it's really sticky situation this ensemble needs to solve by any means they can.One favorite of mine is when the ensemble which consists of Ira, Harry, and Wayne are in the mall against the flying dragon creature, which was cool, as I said malls are always my favorite battle ground, it's really funny how tries to draw out the creature and the ensemble play a part in this.All the actors do well, really like David Duchovny whom is an underrated actor and yes a fan of the TV show ""The X-Files"", that sadly never really had a whole lot or projects that stand out after both that show and this movie.He plays Ira Kane who is pretty much the same Mulder persona where he's really smart but has that dry wit and slight quirkiness to him. You could for this character it was a small journey to redemption as we hear he was a former government scientist that developed a cure for a deadly disease with unfortunately some unforeseen side effects, though the good news is no one died, so it could have been worse; and as a old saying goes ""crap happens"" Ira is a scientist not a psychic. But I like he's a guy that just wants another chance and you could say this alien invasion is one hell of a chance.Harry Block played well by underrated comedic actor Orlando Jones, of course I remember him from ""Mad TV"" which is cool as that's one of my favorite skit comedies and he was one of my favorite members, also a shame didn't have much afterward.Anyway, I like that his character is also a scientist that's smart but not on the same level as Ira as he's a bit of a slacker, from some of what he says it's obvious he hasn't applied himself as much to the scientific field like he should. However, he's a person with I wouldn't say big dreams but big aspirations as deep down he wants to be a really good scientist, have that big discovery that will put him on the map.Really like the back and forth between Ira and Harry, I honestly wouldn't of minded if this film would have been a buddy buddy film, where it was just these two saving the world but still the four way ensemble works all the same.Wayne played well by underrated comedic actor Shawn William Scott. His character just cracks me up as he's not the brightest bulb, but his heart is in the right place and active.I really like that this guy he's a person with big dreams, he wants to be a fire fighter and help people despite a person on the luckless end of things from his once beautiful car which has been smashed by the alien meteorite, though it's a miracle it still works. And having to work in a country club serving one rich douche bag too many. But of course, as an old saying goes ""his luck's about to change"" in a very strange way.Juliane Moore is good as Alison, she's pretty much the straight-laced person in the group. Though her character is a bit of a klutz which I honestly didn't find that funny and was unnecessary no did anything for the film. However, what made he slightly funny was how she sort of reacted, like any regular human being to what's going on.But also, one of those characters that are people that have followed the rules most to all their life and come to that point where they stop and don't care anymore about them. I like that which is something I can emphasize with, just one day saying ""frak this, this isn't working"" or simply go to the winning team when they realize their wasting their time and potential on the wrong one; and Ira's team is of course the winning one.This alien invasion/creature feature is an evolution of fun.Rating: 3 and a half stars",Evolution

And there is no doubt that there is something wrong with it.. even if slightly.Since its first release, I watched 3 times already. And after the last one, I discovered the real problem of it. It's the nature of its character; was it a comedy with smart irony?, or was it a sci-fi horror with diligent CGI?, or was it something mediocre in between?!Surely it's not Ghostbusters for the same director 15 years ago without the strong cast, the goofy look, or the prospering antecedence. Unlike the old formula: spoof of a spook, then a good laugh, this time it's a real spooky scene, then a tired smile. Actually, here, there is more talking about science, less comedy, and horrible images sometimes; still the moment of that creature at the bathroom scares me highly, deeming it one of the most terrifying!The many sci-fi details were catchy and creative, but not funny. Moments like the rampant blue creature, the gigantic mucus and the climax right up the alien's anus--make the movie's original not-so-visible comedy more invisible and full of bad taste.There are some scenes that you won't find at any comedy; like the huge dead creatures in the valley, which confirms some ambition that this movie just doesn't achieve, or enjoys missing with. So with useless scenes, like the 3 leading men singing in their Jeep, you have to feel that the main script was really a pure sci-fi in the first place, then got a little polishing to be fit as a comedy as well.Sorrowfully, David Duchovny and Julianne Moore didn't make me laugh, didn't enthuse me as action heroes, and didn't have any chemistry on-screen. I even felt that (Duchovny) was younger than his character, not to mention frigid at places (the court scene for big instance). Simply all of that left all the time in the world for (Orlando Jones) to own the charisma, create freely and be memorable.(Evolution) is a mix. Somehow dazzling as a sci-fi, but not as a comedy. And you know what? Both ways, its cast didn't wholly click. I think it needed a bit of rectifying to modify its taste; to be something clearer, or more entertaining.So true that there was a silly unnecessary commercial about shampoo at the end. But there was also a brilliant moment in which finally someone declared it: ""I saw that movie before. The black dude dies first"". As you see, according to this last irony, it gives itself nearly the 6 out of 10.",Evolution
44,jamesrupert2014,Predictable and only moderately amusing attempt to recreate the magic of 'Ghostbusters',5,6 July 2020,"A meteorite carrying rapidly growing and evolving alien organisms crashes down near Glen Canyon and soon strange creatures are popping up everywhere. The films is very similar to director Ivan Reitman's monster hit 'Ghostbusters' (1984) but not nearly as good. Leads David Duchovny (as Ira Kane) and Orlando Jones (as Harry Block) don't bring much to the picture - Duchovny is not much of a comedian and would have been better playing the entire part straight-faced, and Jones just seems to be channeling Eddie Murphy. The third leading male, Seann William Scott (as Wayne Grey) gets the most outright comic material but is more irritating than amusing. The distaff lead, Julianne Moore (as Dr. Allison Reed), doesn't get much to work with. She's the standard 'meet cute' love interest for Kane and predictably switches sides in the third act. Apparently Moore elected to make her character clumsy, perhaps in an attempt to make her interesting as well. The special effects are well done and imaginative (at least in the first half, afterwards the 'creatures' get bigger but stop being very innovative). A number of comic 'set pieces' go on too long, especially since the 'punch-lines' are so predictable you're just waiting for the bit to end. There are some good moments (the opening shots in the metamorphosing cave are excellent and Dan Aykroyd's Arizona governor is great) but not enough to raise this film from being simply a flat attempt to update a winning formula without investing in the talent needed to do so.",Evolution
45,atinder,A lot of fun for the whole family,8,28 December 2010,"This movie is really funny , I really liked how all the Aliens creatures are total different from one and another and the way some of creatures looked were really great special effects.One of one favourite part of the movie, which I can not, not mention is the house full of the those Women and one of the women open door and then appears nice looking creature and one of women say's When did you a get dog""That scene made me laugh so much also most stop breathing and as I on the floor.

46,XweAponX,Fruit-basket for Russel Woodman!,10,12 March 2012,"This movie administers a High Colonic to High Comedy Just to SEE David Duchovny's Butt against Glass mooning Russel Woodman/""Jamie Gumb"" (Ted Levine) is worth any admission fee or rental price. I missed this film in the Theatre, I should have gone.David Duchovny parodies his own Fox Mulder character in this 2001 Ivan Reitman extravaganza- It's Amazing, how every Reitman film follows a kind of formula: Which was laid down in the first Ghostbusters movie. We have the two ""Academics"" - Ira Caine (Duchovny) and Harry Block (Orlando Jones) - Then there are a few kids under their tutelage - Then there is the ""Loser"" (Originally, the Lewis character in Ghostbusters)- Here, that is played out by Seann William Scott. Reitman always has the ""Loser"" character redeem themselves, which Scott does with his ""Bird Call"" and Singing to an air-breathing alien in an enclosed shopping mall.An Asteroid falls to the earth, right on top of Scott's Blow-Up Doll as he practices his would-be firefighting skills in the desert of Arizona. Harry Block is the local USGS investigator, he ""Clicked over to the USGS site while looking at Girls Volley Ball Team Photos""- As he needs an actual scientist to help him figure it out, he endorses the help of his friend, Chemistry Professor Ira Caine who has a sordid past with The Pentagon.They discover some unusual things with the Asteroid, but in true Reitman fashion, the US Army (by keeping tabs on Caine's Computer) moves in and takes over the whole operation.But they are screwing it up, and it is up to Caine and Block, with the help of CDC Specialist and """"Ice Maiden"" Allison Reed (Julian Moore who is an obvious parody of Dana Scully) to set things straight - If not, the rapidly evolving Aliens will soon spread across the world within a matter of days! Reitman films start small- and get Big, and then even Bigger - The Stay Puft Marshmallow man? There is a version of that in this film as well! Reitman sticks to his formula, and it works here.This movie moves fast, so if you turn your head, you miss key information. But it is not that hard to keep your eyes glued to the boob tube in this one. There is some great Location work, and lots of great Character Actors with typically Reitman dialog. Especially from Sarah Silverman who plays Caine's former girlfriend, and who is still wearing his SHIRT - And tries to give it back to Caine in the middle of a restaurant!As a ""Science Fiction"" story, there is an interesting thing about Life Forms based on Selenium. So naturally, which shampoo would you use to kill them? Duchovny pulls out all the stops and no part of Fox Mulder is sacred as he rips The X Files a new belly-hole.Actually this film runs quite a bit like the ""Comedy"" X-Files episodes, like ""Dreamland I and II."" Like Ghostbusters, what begins with two guys (Caine and Block) rapidly becomes a small ""Team"" - First the addition of Scott as a Sidekick and wanna-be Fireman, then Moore adds her expertise, and finally, the two heavy Kids, the football Players from Caine's Chemistry Class join the club - And THEN and ONLY THEN is this unlikely team of heroes ready to save the world as we know it!One More Word - Duchovny Turned Down an opportunity to be in the 2nd ""Prequel"" Star Wars Trilogy Film - And this was a good move on his part, because as low rated as this film is, THIS film IS Duchovny. Just like ""Playing God"" - There are certain movies Duchovny does good in, and this was one. So I give him my HIGH respect for choosing this role over the obvious ""easy money"" role Lucas would have tossed him.After you watch this film - LET'S SHAMPOO US SOME ALIENS!",Evolution
47,Chris_Docker,Unevolved sci-fi comedy,5,30 July 2001,"More monsters with lots of hopefully comic touches. Same sci-fi/comedy balance that Mars Attacks aimed for, but with slightly less success. Gags like acclaimed actress Julianne Moore falling over every few scenes (being a dippy sexy scientist who doesn't look where she's going) fall flat rather sooner than they should. The monsters are fun, and keep ""evolving"", which at least keeps the movie interest above the snooze zone. Go along expecting the rubbish you might reasonably guess this to be and you might enjoy it as better than the awful movie you thought it would be. It's not awful - just hasn't evolved far up the scale.",Evolution
48,jimbo-53-186511,Evolution was probably a lot more fun to make than it was to watch,4,31 March 2020,"College professors Ira (David Duchovny) and Harry (Orlando Jones) decide to investigate a large rock that has plummeted from the sky and crashed into the Arizona desert. At an early stage, Ira and Harry discover that this rock is otherworldly when they find living organisms within it. However, before they are able to carry out any further studies, they find that the government and the army have combined forces and have taken over their project and have stolen their research. Unwilling to give in, Ira and Harry try to recover their research, but they're unprepared for what they've actually discovered which is something far more threatening and imposing than any Army or government...I get that Evolution is a film that's not meant to be taken seriously (despite all the scientific data and theorising that is seemingly integral to the plot). It's clearly supposed to be a goofy 'aliens are threatening to take over the world' type of story and therefore I'm not going to criticise the plotting as it's clearly meant to be a daft bit of fun...Despite all of the silly plotting, Evolution is not a particularly funny film; part of the reason for the film's failings lie with Duchovny and Jones who are both fine on their own or when they are acting with other people, but when they are together allegedly as a 'double act' it is here where the film misfires (mostly this is down to the material, but partly it was down to Duchovny who looks stiff and uncomfortable in the comedy moments - it may have worked better if Scott was the double act with Jones as he is far more natural and accomplished in this territory). Another example of a shortcoming with this film was side-lining a comedy actor like Seann William Scott for so long and worst still not really giving him any funny material to work with. The opportunity to make this funnier was there for the taking, but for whatever reason it seemed to get missed. Another thing that never sat well with me was Julianne Moore's shift in character which never really felt believable.Although Evolution is not a very funny film, it did, at least, have a reasonable story and I also liked the direction that the narrative inevitably took (i.e the little guys taking on the big guys) and what shocked me the most was the team's ploy to overthrow the aliens - it's surprising and original to say the least.In summary then despite some appealing actors and a goofy premise with huge potential Evolution is short on laughs (I think I only laughed a couple of times) and I also felt it didn't get the best use out of its actors. I have to concede that the last 30 minutes was pretty good, but the first 60 minutes was very hit and miss with sadly more miss than hit.Still at least it looked like everyone had a good time making the film.",Evolution
49,arthur_tafero,Crap Royale: Evolution,1,5 December 2018,"As a comedy, this is a complete failure; Duchovny is only vaguely talented in that area. The supporting cast had no choice; they had to be there. Reitman must have thought he was doing a remake of Ghostbusters, a movie that was that was far more successful because it was strictly a comedy with three fine comedian actors. This film has no comedic talent. The one star is for the special effects, which, quite frankly, aren't that good, either. This is the worst film Reitman ever did and it marked the end of his career, as it was a colossal box office bomb. I wish I could find something nice to say about this film; but it is so shallow that the one star rating now looks generous. My condolences to Juliane Moore and Dan Ackroyd.",Evolution
50,lukem-52760,GREAT FUN FROM THE GREAT IVAN REITMAN,8,25 January 2020,"No this may not be ""Ghostbusters"" but it's still a great fantastic Comedy made in that style, i really like ""Evolution"" & think it's very underrated & feels almost forgotten!!!
Ivan Reitman is a fantastically Director & a comic genius that makes really rewatchable feelgood Comedies, I've been a fan since little & watching ""Kindergarten Cop"" & ""Ghostbusters 1&2"" & ""Twins"" & ""Junior"" & ""Stripes"" i mean the man is a legend of cinema.I consider Ghostbusters 2 as my all time favourite film from my childhood & Ivan Reitman is one of my favourite directors of all time.""Evolution"" is an fx filled sci-fi Comedy Adventure with a good cast of wacky characters, even Ivan Reitman regular & friend Dan Aykroyd has a role as the Governor & that's nice seeing Aykroyd back in a Reitman film.
Anyway the cast is all having a good time on screen with Julianne Moore, David Duchovny & the hilarious Orlando Jones & the then big Comedy star Sean William Scott, a great cast & some Awesome Alien Creatures & alot of Comic fun in the very Ivan Reitman style!!!
Two local Scientists investigate a crashed meteorite in the Arizona Desert & discover an Alien invasion, that's basically the story & it feels very ""Ghostbusters"" at times with the scientists Ira Kane (Duchovny) & Harry Block (Jones) who get help from a government Agent (Moore) & a local Trainee fireman (Sean William Scott) & they make a cool team who go up against all different Alien Creatures ro save their town.

Meanwhile Wade (Scott) goes through many amusing jobs and acts as the idiot comedian in the film. I actually did like this film, but it didn't successfully make the humor very funny. The slapstick was Julianne Moore always falling and being accident prone, and that was just stupid. It seems that they tried to save any funny lines for Dan Aykroyd as the Governor, who makes a few amusing appearances.

Ivan Reitman made a funny and engaging film about an impending invasion, making not only a comedy but a cool psuedo-sci-fi film that not only had some cool effects, but some great comedy. I especially loved Orlando Jones in his role as Prof. Harry Block, and Seann William Scott managed to not annoy me for the first time in his career. I especially liked David Duchovny as Ira Kane, which seemed to be spawned from his former character of Fox Mulder. Overall, I would give this film a 6.7/10, simply because their were just too many moments that didn't quite click in this film.

55,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A bit underrated, ""Evolution"" is a solid, humorous Ivan Reitman film in the same vein of ""Ghostbusters"", though not quite as fresh...",7,2 April 2013,"Ivan Reitman's 2001 release ""Evolution"" appears to be a prototype for a potential franchise very similar to Reitman's own iconic ""Ghostbusters"" series. It follows the same sort of archetypal set-up in its assembly of a team, and an otherworldly problem only they can handle, despite meddling and objections from government forces.For all intents and purposes, one could safely call it a sort of ""spiritual remake"" of ""Ghostbusters"" with a focus on Sci-Fi rather than the supernatural.And for the most part, ""Evolution"" works as a fun little film.David Duchovny and Orlando Jones star as Arizona college professors Ira Kane and Harry Block. When a meteorite crashes, they go to investigate, taking samples which show something curious- the microbial alien life attached to the meteor appear to be evolving at a highly accelerated rate- millions of years of evolution in mere hours. As the evolution progresses more and more, turning the site of the meteor into a full- fledged, miniature alien atmosphere and forest, government agents arrive. Lead by a former college (Ted Levine) from Ira's military days, the government locks out Kane and Block, and quarantines the area. With them is beautiful government official Alison Reed (Julianne Moore).However, the accelerated evolution begins to cause problems as the alien life begins to escape and threaten the nearby city. Ira and Harry are forced to team with Alison as well as good-natured by oafish local fireman Wayne Grey (Sean William Scott) to battle the alien menace and save the day.The saving graces of the film really fall to two main aspects: the chemistry of the cast and the superb direction by Reitman.The cast gives generally good performances and mesh together quite well. Duchovny is a joy as Ira Kane and bring a lot of heart, and the obvious love story with the clumsy but ultimately good Alison Reed is fun to watch play out. Jones is good as Harry Block, though he always struck me as being a bit on the cartoonish side. Sean William Scott is hilarious, but again a little too broad as Wayne Grey. But the four together make an admirable, memorable team and function extremely well together on screen. Once together, they create a great heart to the story, and keep you interested as a viewer. Other performances by the likes of Ted Levine and a cameo by Dan Aykroyd are marvelous.The direction is the other strong piece in the film. Reitman has always been a simple but wonderful visual storyteller, and his direction is first class.However, the film does have a lot of flaws. Mainly relating back to the script and comedic set-pieces. There's just a few too many jokes built around... *ahem* ""rear-ends"", and it becomes juvenile. A lot of the jokes are also a bit too obvious and broad. And it moves just a tad too fast for it's own good, making it feel a little forgettable in the long run.But all-in-all, this is a fun little ""semi-forgotten"" film from the early 2000's. It's a great rainy-day movie, and I'd recommend it for some laughs.""Evolution"" gets a solid 7 out of 10 from me.",Evolution

60,TheUnknown837-1,I suppose a proctologist might find this amusing....,5,29 October 2009,"Sometimes we come across movies that take a solemn, serious approach, but when it's all over and done, we realize that it should have been a comedy. That's not the case with Ivan Reitman's ""Evolution."" Rather, this is a comedy that should have taken a solemn, serious approach because as a supposed-to-be-funny movie, it does not quite work. The concept of this movie is one I liked. A meteorite crash-lands on earth and when the scientists begin to investigate it (as they inevitably do in science-fiction movies) they discover a unique organism attached to it. And within days, the organism has mutated and rapidly evolved into a wide variety of creatures that begin to wreck havoc across the frontier of Arizona.As a serious, competent science-fiction thriller, ""Evolution"" might have worked. And it might have worked still as a comedy had the filmmakers taken a different approach to the jokes and humor. I knew ""Evolution"" was a comedy when I sat down to watch it, but I was surprised by one thing. I was expecting a science-fiction comedy that might have an appeal to a microbiologist. But by the end, I realized it was more of a science-fiction comedy for a proctologist. Frankly, there were just too many butt-of-jokes and butt-jokes for my liking. There's a scene where a guy moons another character, Orlando Jones has to undergo proctology to remove an alien infection, and then there's the climax which turned my stomach instead of making my laugh.Apart from the proctology-centered jokes, there was more in ""Evolution"" that just gave me the creeps as opposed to making me laugh. Instead of making me laugh, the alien organisms and their variety of shapes and sizes made me want to gag. And this ties in with how much better the movie would have been if it had approached the subject matter from a more cemented angle. It's at these moments that you realize the movie has an identity crisis and that also gets in the way of any pleasure you might have otherwise absorbed.Bottom line, there are a few moments to the movie that I did enjoy, but they did not outnumber the parts that made me cringe, roll my eyes, shake my head, and wish I had chosen another movie. Perhaps a proctologist would find this movie amusing. Personally, I thought it was kind of repulsive, disorientated, and very, very dry. This is a first-class example of a missed opportunity.",Evolution
61,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's made from familiar parts, but tight direction and a good cast make them fit together quite well",7,12 March 2021,"After a meteor strikes just outside Glen Canyon, professors Ira Kane and Harry Block (David Duchovny and Orlando Jones) investigate it and find evidence of extraterrestrial life. Their discovery continues to baffle the two as what initially starts out as single cell organisms evolve into multi cell organisms within a few hours. While Ira is determined to keep his research a secret, the project is soon taken over by both the CDC's Dr. Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) and the U.S. Military's General Russell Woodman (Ted Levine) after it's been revealed that Dr. Kane has been under surveillance since being forcibly discharged from the U.S. Military. While the military tries to keep the repeatedly evolving alien creatures contained to the impact site, the creatures use the network of tunnels and mine shafts throughout Glen Canyon to escape and slowly but surely become more adaptive to Earth's atmosphere and environment.Released in 2001 to mixed reviews and somewhat disappointing box office, Evolution was largely dismissed by critics as Ivan Reitman attempting to recapture the success of Ghostbusters but using aliens in place of ghosts. While the mixture of high concept sci-fi and comic hi-jinks is reminiscent of Ghostbusters, it's important to note that Ghostbusters was basically a sci-fi update on old haunted house comedies like Hold that Ghost and The Ghost Breakers. Evolution takes more of an inspiration from older science fiction films such as Them! or It Came From Outer Space with the Calfornia/Arizona area being reminiscent of the isolated desert towns in both those movies. Originally written as a serious sci-fi horror film by Don Jakoby inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's The Color Out of Space. The script eventually caught the attention of Ivan Reitman who changed the film with the help of writers David Diamond and David Weissman. Jakoby apparently liked the direction on his script and apparently offered insights as a consultant to help maintain flow and transition. While the movie's mixture of horror and comedy isn't perfectly balanced, Evolution is a reasonably fun comic sci-fi film with some really good gags.The cast is quite good with David Duchovny and Orlando Jones having really good chemistry with each other. Duchnovny in particular is having a lot of fun playing sort of a low key spoof of his Fox Mulder persona from X-Files and it's really a very good point in the film's favor that brings a lot of goodwill with it. Wisely the movie doesn't make any winking nods or X-Files references and it lets the association speak for itself rather than driving it too hard. Orlando Jones is very funny as Harry Block who plays his part with infectious enthusiasm and gets some really good laughs from being the more vocal and energized counterpart to Duchonvy.The supporting cast is reasonably good. Ted Levine makes a good secondary antagonist for the film very much playing up the stubborn military man archetype seen in many alien invader sci-fi films, and while not outright funny he does make a decent enough straight man to the proceedings with his downplayed and stoic delivery. Seann William Scott is decent enough as aspiring firefighter/country club attendant Wayne Grey (even if his justification for being in the movie is tenuous at best), Julianne Moore as Allison Reed is unfortunately not given much. The character is prone to clumsiness (at points) and apparently this was the idea of Moore, I can see why she wanted to bring it in because without the clumsiness there really isn't all that much to her character other than as acting as a foil/love interest for Kane. It really is a shame because Moore can be funny when given the right material (such as The Big Lebowski) but unfortunately Moore isn't called to do much. The best part bar none is Dan Akyroyd playing the Arizona Governor who although the role isn't a particularly meaty one, he goes full force with it and owns every minute he's on screen.The action/sci-fi elements are quite well done. The creature designs have unique variations as they rapidly changed from amoeba like microbes, to flatworms, to bugs, to even dragon like creatures and primates. The creature designs are well rendered with some good computer effects (and isolated usage of practicals here and there), the climax however is somewhat disappointing. Without giving too much away the big bad of the film is basically a purplish-pink blob. How they take it town I suppose is somewhat humorous, but only because of a call back to an earlier gag on a smaller scale that was funnier. There's also a gag built around Seann William Scott's character in a mall which isn't all that funny and has a rather predicable payoff. But despite some floundering gags, there's enough ones that legitimately work and the comedic rhythm is very strong.While Evolution owes much of its existence to previously existing sci-fi/horror comedies like Tremors, Men in Black, and Ghostbusters, it does just enough with its premise to make itself a respectable entry into the sub-genre. The performances carry a comic energy and chemistry among the key players that gives life to scenes in the film, and while the climax is somewhat disappointing there's enough material along the way to make this a well recommended viewing.",Evolution

63,mattymatt4ever,Surprisingly fun!,7,10 June 2001,"I can't say I suspected much from the previews.  I anticipated another lame comedy and a cheap imitation of ""Men in Black.""  ""Evolution"" can be compared to ""MIB"" in certain aspects, but it breaks new ground.I can't give a really scientific review, because quite frankly I was too busy laughing to weigh out the pros and cons.  This is a great popcorn movie!  (Metaphorically speaking, I was eating nachos) There are scary moments involving slimy creatures, so chances are if there are any females with you--they will be clinging onto your arms.  Ivan Reitman is the famed director of the ""Ghostbusters"" movies, and ""Evolution"" has much of the same charm and quirky sense of style and humor. David Duchovny (who really has a good sense of humor off-camera, but happens to get stuck with mostly serious roles) is terrific in a looser role that enables him to flaunt his knack for comedy.  Of course, Orlando Jones is the funniest in the bunch.  He has a terrific scene in which a bug crawls inside his skin and doctors have to get it out...rectally.  I have to say, that was the highlight of this offbeat comedy and had me on the floor!  Julianne Moore plays the clumsy assistant.  I can't say I found her role all that humorous.  Her pratfalls are pretty lame and predictable.  But that minor hint of cheap slapstick didn't ruin the overall experience. 
""Evolution"" is great fun from start to finish (a very interesting finish with an innovative product placement)!  Sure, it's all low-brow, but it works and the crude humor is tamed down to a tolerant level (Well, compared to the average contemporary comedy).  This is not a movie to be studied or analyzed or discussed for hours at a time.  Just sit back and HAVE SOME FUN!!!

64,vip_ebriega,"Giant bugs, slimy aliens. Now who you gonna call?",7,9 May 2007,"My Take: Though derivative, its funny and insanely enjoyable. It's summer and what else could you possibly have in mind? A meteor that's about to strike earth? An unlikely duo of college professors who happen to discover that the military is covering this up because it happens to contain alien life forms? Or what about kicking these aliens' butt when they start getting nasty? Whatever your summer-viewing pleasure hankers, EVOLUTION delivers, even if sometimes you wonder if you have seen this all before. I first watched this in the theaters, then watched it numerous times on TV, and I never got tired of watching it. Lots of laughs, suspense and over-the-top fun, what more can you ask for. The film closely goes with the same line of the genre as in great hit monster flicks like ""MIB: Men in Black"" and the hit ""Ghostbusters"" films. This film is directed by Ivan Reitman, who also directed both ""Ghostbusters"" and the sequel. Reitman once again gifts the film with hilarious touches of humor, and some weird bits of suspense, resulting into a hilarious summer action delight. David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Julianne Moore, Sean William Scott and the rest of the cast don't just bring laughs, they also have the charm which will make you adore their characters. Sometimes, the movie works because the chemistry melds together, and these guys have it. As far as summertime entertainment is concerned, it ain't really about trying to come up with something original, it's really more of how you wave the magic wand to make it work. Reitman may have used his GHOSTBUSTERS formula to the death here (while throwing in a little MIB and an X-FILES send-off, or maybe a dash of reptilian monsters borrowed from JURASSIC PARK), but he has the right magic to make this one work at least one more time.

Director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Twins, Kindergarten Cop) can't seem to make up his mind if he wants it to be a straight science fiction flick or a parody.  The result is a film that is far too goofy to be good science fiction and nowhere near funny enough to be good comedy.A great cast is wasted on a script that lays one unfunny egg after another. The only one able to squeeze any comedy out of his lines is Orlando Jones. David Duchovny and Julianne Moore mostly try to play it straight and Ted Levine plays his part as too much of a doofus.  Seann William Scott is occasionally so bizarre that it is humorous, but mostly his character is more stupid than funny.The one strength of the film is the visual effects.  The monsters are innovative and realistic.  The scene where the flying reptile is terrorizing the shopping mall is particularly good.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the creatures.

76,bregund,Terrible,1,26 August 2005,"Seldom does one see a film so awful. Even Baby Geniuses wasn't this bad. Duchovny's comic timing is terrible, and the witty repartee that one normally finds in buddy movies such as this is completely lacking between Duchovny and Orlando Jones; it's absolutely amazing, watch this movie and you'll see that there is zero chemistry between the main characters. I wonder if this was deliberate.Here's one reason this movie doesn't make any sense: a meteor crashes to earth and a community college instructor and his buddy discover that life is evolving from the meteor. So now that the most astounding scientific discovery in thousands of years has happened right under their noses, what happens? They casually go about their normal routine, taking students on a field trip to visit the meteor, sitting around chatting, basically ignorant of the miracle that is happening under their very noses. It's so stupid, it just wouldn't happen like this unless the main characters were made out to be stupid in the first place, but Reitman doesn't take this angle. He plays it seriously like a black comedy, but then pulls out something stupid like the golf course dude falling asleep at his fireman exam. The characters aren't well defined at all. Why should I care about any of them, Reitman doesn't take the time to flesh them out, he seems to be ridiculing their superficiality while simultaneously starving them of the witty dialogue necessary to pull off a black comedy. The result is a mishmash of facial expressions and clichés mined from one hundred years of comedy and vaudeville, all thrown together in an attempt to get something to stick. It's like taking everything in your refrigerator and mixing it all together and hoping it will taste good.It doesn't.I'll echo the sentiments of another reviewer who said the film lost him when they were taking the mosquito thing out of Jones. If that isn't bad enough, Jones hops up and threatens the doctor never to do that again. So? Next time the doctor will just leave the insect inside of him? This movie is painfully stupid.",Evolution

79,DavidSim240183,Ghostbusters meets Men in Black,8,15 May 2005,"When Ivan Reitman directed Ghostbusters (one of my all time favourite comedies) in 1984, it was the runaway hit of the year. And with good reason. It combined cutting edge special effects with a terrific troupe of comedians from Saturday Night Live, and redefined what mainstream comedy could be all about.But since then, Ivan Reitman's career has been decidedly uneven. With Evolution, he has made a welcome return to form. Although it doesn't come close to eclipsing Ghostbusters, this amiable comedy is an amusing and inventive film, and one of Reitman's more well rounded comedies of recent years.Like Ghostbusters, Evolution is about a group of scientists who take it upon themselves to save the world. But not from the supernatural. This time the threat comes from the stars.Our story begins when a meteorite crashes to Earth in the Arizona desert. Inside the meteor are alien cells. Once they've arrived on Earth, they begin to evolve into all manner of different creatures. First it's just little things like worms and insects. But they start becoming more dangerous and intelligent. Things like amphibians, reptiles, primates, and eventually an enormous blob (don't ask!).The task of stopping these aliens has fallen into the hands of disgraced scientist Dr Ira Kane (David Duchovny) and the kooky Prof Harry Block (Orlando Jones). Two scientists who don't exactly inspire you with confidence, and if truth be told, seem a little half-arsed about everything. That's not surprising, since Reitman never portrays scientists as egg-headed geniuses. More like eccentrics only marginally more intelligent than people you'd meet on the streets. That was the way it was in Ghostbusters, and that's how it is with Evolution.Ira and Harry are joined by a sexy (and clumsy) scientist Dr Allison Reed (Julianne Moore) and trainee fireman Wayne Grey (Seann William Scott). Our hopeless foursome are all that stands between the aliens and Earth's extinction.It's impossible not to compare Evolution with Ghostbusters, because barring the fact the threat is alien this time, the plot is virtually identical. A group of scientists are called in to save the day. CGI creations running amok, and turning into something enormous they have to defeat to save the world.That's not to say its a terrible film. Personally, I don't mind if directors use the same sound ideas, just as long as they find a new spin on them. Although Ira and Harry don't have the crackling chemistry the Ghostbusters had, they do make a personable double act. David Duchovny has a real talent for understated comedy. His dry wit almost reminds you of Bill Murray at times.Orlando Jones is more zany but there are times when he really cracked me up, especially the scene where he has a pair of forceps jammed up his arse to retrieve a pesky fly inside his body. The two actors work well together, and they are rather endearing, so that's definitely a positive.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott. Moore is rather flat, and never comes across as funny. For some reason she thought the idea of being an accident prone scientist would make people laugh. Quite frankly I don't know how Julianne Moore ever agreed to sign on to this project. A great actress like her deserved much better.And as for Seann William Scott, well I've never been a fan of him anyway. He always seems so obnoxious to me, which is why I didn't like the American Pie films all that much. He doesn't really add anything, and his presence was probably just a marketing ploy by the producers to bring in a teenage audience as well.I know I sound like I'm riffing the film, but Evolution does have it's strong points as well. The CGI effects are top notch, and we really do get a colourful assortment of creatures in this film. Personally my favourite part is when an alien dinosaur swoops into a shopping centre and makes off with a shoplifter. Ira, Harry and Wayne's rescue of the girl is one scene that recaptures the spirit of Ghostbusters, and then afterwards when they're on a high listening to ""Play That Funky Music"" it's not only funny, it fills you with a warm fuzzy feeling.It also has a nice line of supporting characters. Dan Aykroyd puts in an hilarious appearance as the Governor of Arizona. He has the self important befuddled politician stereotype down to a tee, and lights up the film whenever he's around. I also liked Katharine Towne as Nadine, one of Harry's students. She only gets a couple of scenes, but she's very funny as a prissy Valley Girl.Inevitably, things come to a head with the aliens coming together to form a massive blob (as I mentioned before). This giant monstrosity is not nearly as memorable as Mr Stay Puft, but at least it gives the FX technicians an opportunity to make the ending look impressive. Our heroes chosen weapon is Head and Shoulders (believe it or not!). That's not as preposterous as it sounds, especially from my perspective, who has used Head and Shoulders in the past, and knows exactly what it can do!Evolution was sadly not the success Ghostbusters was. It's not so surprising really, because Evolution was probably trying to cash in on the success of other recent sci-fi comedies like Men in Black. But Evolution is still an entertaining film, even if you don't root for these characters like the Ghostbusters.One thing I do like about Evolution. The Smiley face logo with the third eye.

It's light, it's gross, it's a little spooky at times and pretty silly other times. It's never actually hilarious but it IS watchable and entertaining. I like the leading lady in this- she's yummy and 'ol Dave from X-files fame is always a good comedic talent smart ass. They have nice chemistry. I guess this is targeted as a family movie you can take teens to but I think some teens have a high potential of being bored by this.

Occasionally our politically correct inclusion of a comedic relief non-threatening black man in a positive role gets about as tiresome as Jar-Jar banks, but Dave Duchovny's quick wit smooths over his occasional lameness.I was annoyed at several moments that revealed a low level of intelligence from the script writers including contrived plot twists with zero logic that kid-gloved what should have been a rather nice chunky and bloody scene. I would have appreciated a little more legitimacy and only using jokes that were super funny. This is overall, a sophomoric movie at best but it's still kinda watchable in a dorky sci fi kinda way.

I thought that David Duchovny wouldn't mix well with Orlando Jones and the whole story seemed pretty weak to me when I read about it earlier in the day. I was caught off guard by this one.Dr. Ira Krane (David Duchovny) and Prof. Harry Block (Orlando Jones) are two teachers at Glenn Canyon Community College and aren't going anywhere. One day, after taking his class on an expedition to a meteor crash site, Dr. Ira Krane makes an amazing discovery. Aliens are slowly evolving and adapting on Earth. Dr. Krane wishes to make more discoveries and experiment with the new life forms but is stopped by the government who is now taking hold of the discovery.But soon the situation gets out of control when the aliens become more hostile and smarter. Now, with the help of firefighter cadet (Seann William Scott) and a nerdy military scientist (Julianne Moore), Ira and harry must figure a way to convince the military that they need to be in control of the project and to find a way to stop the now massive organisms from taking control of the planet.To my surprise, Duchovony and Jones mixed quite well. Jones had some fantastic lines and really held quite a bit of the comedy. Duchovony, knowing him only from his serious role on the X-Files, was surprisingly funny and filled the role perfectly. Seann William Scott, though placed in this for the goofy side of comedy, was able to still fit in making his character believable, he's just stupid though.The special effects are put into the film to be the eye popping but the aren't bad.

88,the amorphousmachine,Lighthearted Comedy! (minor spoilers),6,28 December 2001,"Ivan Reitman, director of 80s blockbuster 'Ghostbusters', creates an entertaining but formulaic science-fiction comedy in 'Evolution'. David Duchovny plays a college professor, Dr Ira Kane, who investigates a meteor crash along with his colleague, Dr Harry Block (Orlando Jones), in the Arizona desert. They discover that the meteor is a life form and is evolving at a rapid pace. The military eventually quarantines the crash-site under the control of General Woodman (Ted Levine) who Kane used to work with. Woodman, assisted by scientist Dr Alison Reed (Julianne Moore), prevent Kane and Block from entering the alien site which is slowly evolving. Although Kane is strangely attracted to Dr Alison Reed, he and Block infiltrate the site after the military steal their initial documentations. Eventually Reed, Kane, Block and a wannabe fireman, Wayne Green (Seann William Scott), work together to battle weird alien creatures as the evolving crash-site spreads into the town.After an awkward beginning, 'Evolution' becomes quite funny in parts, especially during a scene where Block (Orlando Jones) has an alien bug enter his body. Seann William Scott is also quite funny and David Duchovny plays his usual dead pan self, but it works well within the comic context of the film. The visual effects are very cool, with some interesting alien characters appearing throughout the film adding to the comic aspect as well. At times, 'Evolution' feels awkwardly paced and formulaic in it's script, and the romantic angle between Julianne Moore and David Duchovny's characters does not really work! Reitman's 'Evolution' definitely beats out his last two duds, 'Six Days, Seven Nights' and 'Father's Day', but doesn't quite live up to 'Ghostbusters'. It's entertaining to watch and has some genuinely funny moments, but 'Evolution' is not a riotous comedy. The science fiction element is blended well, but it is not a must-see for the big screen as the visual effects can equally be appreciated on video. Worth seeing if you have seen everything already, or if you're particularly in the mood for light-hearted science-fiction comedy. *** out of *****!",Evolution

Duchovny has another alien-busting, sexy red-head to play with, in the shape of Julianne Moore. Orlando Jones is the fourth goo-buster, and provides some of the funniest moments. Dan Aykroyd has a small part, but he can still perform.This is one of those movies the whole family can enjoy, nothing too smutty or sexual, no offensive language. It's not too demanding, and does just enough to keep you interested to the end. Some of the effects look a bit shaky, but some of them are very impressive indeed.

I'll admit that it must take a special talent to spend that on a movie and have it feel like something made by student film-makers.EVOLUTION was originally going to be a straight sci-fi thriller, and it might have been a good one.  Adding the ""comic"" elements just took all possible suspense out of it.  If the three 'heroes' are really uptight about the menace facing them, why are they singing ""Play That Funky Music, White Boy,"" while they're driving?This problem of tone is what sets the whole movie going in the wrong direction.

This time the theme is Alien lifeforms.Just as Ghost Busters 2, this movie is highly under-rated. David Dukovny is a great actor, no matter what people say. The comedy undoubtedly, in parts, was a tad more off-the-wall than in Ghost Busters but the movie delivers a type of experience that I find extremely entertaining. You get both seriousness and comedy, something which most people have difficulty accepting (in the same film).Dukovny's dead-pan delivery also mirrors that of Bill Murray and over all helps to create a very similar feel as in Reitman's previous films. Particularly the scene where the heroic male-trio hunts down the terradactyl-like beast in a shopping mall brings Ghost Busters to mind.Some points of criticism include the rather rushed ending and a slight inconsistency in the quality of the CGI. Reagardless, both a fun and a clever movie.",Evolution
93,HenryHextonEsq,Quite enjoyable - spoiler maybe,6,19 July 2001,"This film did at least take itself less seriously than many of the other recent Hollywood films that tend to make an obsession out of pyrotechnics. It was a reasonably funny comedy-cheap-sci-fi type-film, if one is to sum it up. At times, it was unfunny in the cynical, ""gross-out"" style, but enough laughs were raised through some amusing moments. The idea of having Julianne Moore as a slapstick sideshow was embarrassingly executed, however; not funny, just ungainly, and even less funny when done for the tenth time... Moore does not impress at all here, not judging the comedy correctly at all, and failing to add a compelling straight performance either. David Duchovny hardly gives a great comic performance, but is passable, totally underplaying his role as a questionable scientist. I was quite impressed with Orlando Jones, who did have some grasp of comic timing, and around whom most of the humour was centered. Dan Aykroyd's appearance, and one or two other roles, were superfluous though. I thought perhaps the way it ended was a little too manipulatively ironic and, while the final ""commercial"" is lightly amusing, one didn't expect it to be literalised, when after the film, ""Head and Shoulders"" took the chance to use an outgoing movie crowd as literally a free market for its product. The film is enjoyable stuff for the most part, but I don't suspect it would at all hold up well to subsequent viewings. With the frequency of sexual references and content, I am surprised to see this rated a PG instead of a 12.Rating:- ***/*****",Evolution
94,fjhuerta-2,"Disjointed, not cohesive, too far fetched.",2,24 November 2001,"I wanted so much to like this film. After all, it was made by Ivan Reitman, director of ""Ghostbusters"".I came away from the movie theater trying to justify what I had just seen. And I only felt better when I accepeted the fact that the movie was, well... kind of a failure.First, the good parts. It *is* a tribute to Ghostbusters. How much, you say? Well, it has a ""Slimer"" catching scene (the one with the pterodactyl look-alike), the ending is basically the same, and it has tons of green goo. The main characters are professors at a university. The government agents are, in fact, the bad guys. The list goes on, and on.Now, the bad. Ghostbusters had lots of laughs. This one has lots of forced laughs. When a good director has to resort to flatulence jokes in order to bring out forced laughter from his audience, you know he is way past his prime, or that he couldn't do too much with the material. I think this is evidence of the former. The movie had lots of potential, but it was basically treated as a rehash of a good film.Add to that null character development, in which all of them disappear and reappear on screen almost at random, tremendously unbelievable situations, and way too many jokes that fall flat on their face, and you get a not-so-good movie.And lets not forget the comment of the ""brainy"" doctor, when she observes that ""in 1 week the aliens will invade Arizona, and in a month they will be in all the US, therefore annihilating humanity"". Someone should tell her there is life outside the US border. Oh, well. At least the aliens didn't speak english.",Evolution
95,NJMoon,Theory of EVOLUTION With Apologies to Darwin,5,9 June 2001,"Quick...what's funnier than a fat dumb guy with a bad hair cut???  That's right!  TWO dumb fat guys with bad haircuts!  Director Ivan Reitman constantly sinks lower than primordial slime in order to coax a few meager chuckles out of this sad GHOSTBUSTERS wannabe movie.  Along with the tubby twosome, Reitman adds a bug-eyed black guy (paging Ernie Hudson), a buxom blonde beauty queen, a geeky military guy with coke bottle glasses, anal sex humor, fart jokes, a leading lady with the grace of Gerald Ford, a hardass Army general obsessed with blowing things up, some of the dullest aliens ever to be computer generated, idiotic dialogue, and ""X-Files"" David Duchovny mooning.  And just in you don't get the GHOSTBUSTERS connection, Reitman dumps amiable Dan Aykroyd into the mess.  What Reitman failed to realize is that the formula that made GHOSTBUSTERS and its ilk such a success was that except for the ghosts (here aliens), everything else in the film was perfectly believable - characters and all. In EVOLUTION, reality flies out the window in the opening scenes (Duchovny's college prof gives to losers who don't know a biological cell from a prison cell a ""C"" instead of flunking their fat asses) and never returns.  When Duchovny's back story is revealed, it is so stupid that you'll wanna go out for popcorn and never come back.  At least he has a back story.  Co-star Orlando Jones doesn't even merit one.  Oh, and of course Duchovny and leading lady Julianne Moore have instant attraction syndrome.  I won't tell how the pic ends (duh!) but suffice it to say that Head & Shoulders Shampoo has taken the place of the Staypuft Marshmellow Man. Is it still too late for a bio-pic of Charles Darwin?  Throw in some fat kids, farting, buxom babes, aliens exploding and leads with good tv and teen ""Q"" and it might just be the hit of the summer!",Evolution
96,general-melchett,Entertaining alien comedy!,9,8 December 2006,"I have always enjoyed Evolution - it is a funny, original and exciting film. Though it did kind of bomb at the cinemas, this film has so much to offer - lots of slime and alien beings exploding, lots of idiotic scientists, several big explosions and a fair bit of science. It may not be a masterpiece, but Evolution has never failed to entertain me and I shall enjoy watching it many times more. Whoever had the idea to fuse an alien invasion with comedy should be proud of themselves - this really is sci-fi/comedy. The funniest scene was when Harry Block had to have a bug removed from his backside - who can honestly say that wasn't the best scene of the whole film? Things stay suitably silly throughout, and it isn't horrifically inappropriate or terrifying either - the kids will also find it amusing. Highly recommended. 9/10",Evolution
97,ssvikas,The Funnier side of Science Fiction!,6,8 October 2008,"It is believed that Evolution was to be a movie with a lot of science fiction and alien terror in it. Somehow, the script changed for good and this one turns up as a thoroughly enjoyable comedy with a great dose of science, or at least the likeliness of it thrown in. With big names of serious cinema like David Duchovny of X-Files fame and Julianne Moore of Psycho and Hannibal fame, a comedy of this kind was nice treat for sure.The peaceful town Glenn Canyon in Arizona suddenly becomes a hotbed of activity as a meteorite crashes in the nearby desert. Local science teachers, Ira Kane a disgraced Army Colonel and researcher played by David Duchovny and Harry Block steal a sample from the meteorite and find unusual cellular activity and quickened evolution. Just then, a trainee firefighter discovers strange happenings in the canyon that nearly spook him.The movie’s many comic moments are delivered by Orlando Jones who plays Harry Block and Seann William Scott as firefighter Wayne. The best comic though comes on screen when Ted Livine better known for his role of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs plays General Woodman who leads the Military to cordon off the area and nuke the evolving creatures. He is assisted by a pretty scientist Allison Reed (Julianne Moore).While the movie shows a host of dinosaurs and humanoid chimps that involve a good amount of work with graphics, they are not as scary as a typical Jurassic Park or a Godzilla movie. The fun here is more in the nature of Ghostbusters where ghouls are not really scary and the heroes ward them off. By the time you reach the end of the movie, you just realize that your regular head and shoulders shampoo has new uses too!This movie may have hit screens and gone away without much fanfare but makes a regular appearance on Television. Evolution shows the non-serious face of David Duchovny although he deals with a seemingly dangerous situation on hand. If you don’t plan to have too many expectations with this one, then, without doubt, I would recommend this movie as very funny, yet exciting albeit in an absolutely silly sense.",Evolution
98,peeedeee-94281,Devolution of Comedy,1,13 October 2019,"I don't recall ever seeing this film. I recall the trailer didn't attract me. It looked like a combination of Men In Black, X Files, and Dude Where's My Car.
Anyway, now that I've seen it, I can honestly say I didn't miss anything.
One of the big problems for this film is the comedy. Terrible. Like someone pointed out, it feels like the jokes and gags were ripped out of the 1980s. Late 70s/early 80s era I'd say, but not the good comedies, I'm talking about the horrible ones like Saturday The 14th.
Second bad thing is Orlando Jones. He was okay on Mad TV, but as an actor, he was just not right. He and Duchovny had zero buddy chemistry. Sean William Scott's role in this film was equally puzzling, it seems like it's set up for him to be a part of the majority of the movie, but he actually disappears for much of the first part, and only shows up in the later part to offer up the Fire truck.
What I also didn't like about this film was how Duchovny and Jones' characters were reckless in the way they handled the alien specimen. No protocol for dealing with a possibly dangerous alien life form. They just keep playing around with these things like they're kids toys. But strangely, once the military shows up, Duchovny's character suddenly is concerned about the danger of these creatures and thinks they should be destroyed. Huh? Where did the 180 change in attitude come from? Bizarre.
Also, we see that Duchovny and Jones' community college offices were ransacked and all their notes and specimens were confiscated by the military. But magically, in the late half hour of the movie, we see that Duchovny magically has a specimen (a rather large one too) of the blue goo, which was only there to show how fire made it bigger?!! Where did he pull this specimen from?!
The movie overall just feels it was catering to 12 years old from 1980, rather than a somewhat intelligent sci fi and comedy audience like Men In Black did. I'm glad I missed this one.",Evolution

Hell - even the art direction is weird.Not really bad. Not really good.

102,ivko,a solid premise with missed potential,6,31 January 2021,"Evolution is a decent goofy Sci-Fi movie about an alien invasion that strikes in the deserts of Arizona. A couple of community college professors discover microscopic life living in a meteor that strikes just outside of town. The catch? The life may be small, but it's complex structure allows it to evolve at billions of times the rate that life on earth does. Soon they and the quirky community they live in are dealing with prehistoric critters rapidly evolving up the ladder towards intelligence, and consuming everything in their path as they do so.Tl;dr, the film is decent but doesn't reach its full potential, and not all the humor/references in the film have aged gracefully, but if you can watch it for free on one of your streaming subscriptions it's not a bad lazy Sunday movie.The plot is reasonably interesting for a movie that you've probably never heard of. Part of that is that the movie was released just a few months before 9/11, but even before the national tragedy kind of killed everyone's interest in watching lighthearted comedies for a while the movie wasn't doing especially well. It wasn't bombing, it more or less just broke even in theaters. The problem is it doesn't land its jokes or big scenes very well. I don't know if it's the directing or editing or even the delivery, but a lot of moments that feel like they could have been fun are reduced to a 'meh' feeling.The comedic timing is often off, causing a lot of the big jokes to fall flat or only hit with a fraction of the energy it seems like they could have. Also, some of the jokes that were highlighted in previews at the time haven't aged well, like a scene in which David Duchovny's character states that he doesn't trust government agent types, a joke that references Duchovny's then-famous role as a government agent in the cultural phenomenon show 'The X-Files' . And finally, some of the cast like Dan Akroyd were clearly just doing someone a favor appearing in the movie and feel a little tacked on as their characters only appear in a few narrow scenes and aren't well integrated with the other characters stories.All of which is too bad, because if you get past those issues the plot of the movie is pretty original and interesting in a don't-take-it-too-seriously kind of way. Even when they are turning into monsters the critters are usually brightly colored and cute in an alien muppet way, keeping the horror aspects from overwhelming the comedic. And the CGI, while obviously not anywhere near modern levels of quality, is still pretty decent.The cast is also strong, including many actors who were relative unknowns when the movie was released but would go on to have successful careers. I liked the choice of making Duchovny and Jones scientific wannabees at a community college rather than Ivy league world famous types, which makes their characters more approachable, but I did feel that the movie left Moore a little underused. As the sole legitimate Ivy league world famous type, it might have been more fun to throw the big discoveries about the aliens to her and leave Duchovny and Jones in a more Rosencrantz and Guildenstern type of role, reacting to the big events rather than driving them. I might have also edited out Seann William Scott's role, or at least edited it to make him more integrated into the main characters lives. It seems obvious they wanted him as a third musketeer kind of thing but the connection between him and the professors feels super forced.So it didn't completely bore me, but it didn't blow me away either. In the end it felt like there was maybe a better movie hiding somewhere in it, but I don't regret rewatching it.",Evolution

104,TuckMN,Mindless summer fun.,7,12 June 2001,"This is not going to be a great classic  but if you want broad humour and a silly story  with a few laugh-out-loud jokes  then this is definitely the film for you.  It is always nice to see Julianne Moore and she shows her comic side at its best.  Her portrayal of Alison Reed, the clumsy scientist from the Center for Disease Control, is probably her best comedic turn to date. 
David Duchovny is out chasing aliens again and, in some ways, spoofs his `X-Files' character; he was a good bit of casting.  He has good comic timing and his deadpan delivery is perfect for the character.  He and Ms Moore have good screen chemistry and it would be nice to see them together again.More directors need to think of Orlando Jones when casting films  He really can act and, while the material in `Evolution' doesn't offer too many opportunities to do so, he takes the chances he is given and runs with them. Seann William Scott (Wayne Green) has the not-too-bright good guy' role down letter-perfect.  He has some of the better lines in the movie and, remembering that this is a farce, is probably the most believable character in the movie.The location photography is, at times, dazzling; however, some of the special effects looked very cheesy  very obvious green screen' shots  so obvious that I wondered if they were bad on purpose.  Unfortunately the sound track detracts from the overall end product: it seldom had anything to do with the action on the screen and sometimes was outright annoying.This is a good summer movie:  just go, laugh and don't think too much.",Evolution
105,mgruebel,Cult sci-fi comedy,7,19 February 2018,"Evolution is quite a fun little film. As two college teachers struggle with government agents to get credit for discovering aliens, said aliens rapidly evolve into a menace. Shampoo to the rescue!The main thing I would fault this movie with is that it does not quite get the balance of slapstick humor and character-driven humor right. The CDC director falls a little too often; the mooning scene does nothing for Duchovny's character; and getting sucked into the anus of a cell (whatever that is) might get the 8 year-olds to laugh, but not much anyone else.That said, the film is a whole lot of guilty fun! As a scientist, I was particularly happy to see that they stuck some real science in it, even though things got stretched - a whole lot - to accommodate the zany plot. I saw it again recently while giving my wife a back rub, and even she had to snicker a few times, although she protested when I hinted she might actually have enjoyed parts of this movie. It had aged well, despite the somewhat early-vintage special effects. I think this really has the making of a sci-fi comedy cult classic, with unforgettable set pieces like a snobbish employer of one of the main characters getting dragged from a golf course into oblivion by a gator-like evolved critter. Or the oh-so-cute alien turning out to have a vicious tongue! And of course, the chemistry between the five main characters (three good, one who turns good, and one despicable general) is good - an important ingredient in any comedy worth its salt.So I give this 7 stars, usually reserved for films good enough that I might see them more than once - as I did in this case.",Evolution

The man that did the impossible in making Arnold Schwarzenegger look funny (Twins, Kindergarten Cop) captured my heart and soul with Ghostbusters 1&2, two creative and visually magnificent pieces of cinematic eye-candy that hold a candle even to today's mega-budgeted blockbusters. Obviously, when I heard he was creating a modern day equivalent to the aforementioned duo only with aliens instead of ghosts, my heart skipped a more than a beat. This effect grew stronger upon learning that David Duchovny (aka Fox Mulder from The X Files) is appearing in a comical lead role, corresponding ironically with his serious, moody self from the 1990's hit series X-Files.To tie this all up neatly, the movie itself was everything I hoped to receive  and then some. Apart from top notch comic appearances by Duchovny and Julianne Moore  actors we're used to seeing in much more serious roles, we also get an awkwardly funny Orlando Jones (where the hell did he disappear?) and an embarrassingly stupid Stifler Er, Sean William Scott.So how does the end of the world feel like?

GHOSTBUSTER provided much of the basic format, especially in the early section, while THE BLOB (remake) provided the conclusion. Moore and Duchovny are having a good time not having to be serious. Coming off the filming of HANNIBAL, this must have been a needed respite for Moore.  True, she doesn't really do much in the film but, folks, a movie about hyper-evolving aliens is not the kind of flick where you look for character development.While the flick does stint on the human side, the critters are incredible.  The best way to describe them?  Dr Seuss as re-designed by Hunter S Thompson.  I'd love to have a set of Evolution critters as a toy set.  Yeah, I'd love to see more of the critters' side of things.  That hillside off the housing complex, where the rotting remains of alien dragons lay....  I see that as a scene showing the determination and the tragedy of these critters.Oh, one continuity error--  the critter that dies in the house deflates, but when his remains are examined, he's looking pretty fat.  Of course, the deflated corpse was CGI while the later corpse was a prop, so we can chalk this up to the two departments not quite talking to each other.Oh, and if anyone every gets around to filming McCaffrey's PERN series, I hope they keep these FX guys in mind, as they do a highly believable dragon!",Evolution
114,bernie-122,Just Awful,2,2 June 2007,"I was impressed during the first half, partly because the science was actually almost plausible, a rare thing indeed in any SF film. It showed promise and could have been excellent if the writers had taken the plot in a different direction and there was a less childish director. As soon as the fart and butt jokes started coming, I knew that was it. (Why is the expulsion of intestinal gas regarded with such mirth?) As it was, the movie just got stupider by the minute in the second half, very few of the gags were funny, the science went down the drain and the shampoo commercial ruined whatever was left.Although it is possible to mix SF with comedy, it is very hard to make it actually work. This is a miserable attempt to roll Ghostbusters, MIB and X-Files into one. It didn't just not work, the end product is just embarrassing.If it was going to be merely a vehicle for potty humour, then why didn't they do the obvious and just hire Jim Carrey to do the lead? I can't work out why Duchovny and Moore would agree to be dragged into this career-smearing, steaming turd. The money must've been good.Finally, I would like to comment on all the rave reviews I see here. This is a sad indictment of what this Western society of ours appears to regard as good entertainment. Anybody over 9 years old who finds this funny should immediately do some serious self-examination.I give it a 2, only because the SFX were not too bad, other than the cutesy, Spielberg_esque facial expressions on some of the Aliens.

I guess I never got in on the bandwagon on that one.  I never found it to be as funny as a lot of people (tons of people actually) found it.  I thought parts of it were cool (like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man), but most of the movie was too drab for me, for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution, some of you ask?  Well, it's simple.  The same man directs both movies (Ivan Reitman) and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that, in my opinion, Evolution is better.  Basically, think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens, which I like because aliens, in my opinion, are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff, just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny. Sometimes, when you are expecting a joke, there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.
One last bad note: some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira, if you've seen that movie. There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the ""mouth within a mouth"", a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks alien-comedy, Galaxy Quest (a movie I thought was hilarious).  If you liked Galaxy Quest, and I think most people did, then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is. The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff, so this kind of science interests me.  Overall, I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh, I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7-Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7-Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements (that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining), and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you, this guy is going places.  As for the other actors, they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress, but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic ""walking cardboard cutout"" character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion, please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan, so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year, but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining, not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.  I think it accomplishes its mission.7/10",Evolution

And guess what? Dozens of other movies are infected with the same virus! (Many thanks to Star Wars T.P.M?)SIGH.I love special effects, honestly!!!SIGH.But could they, like, be 'real' ones?  You know, like the effects we saw in Terminator 2, or even Empire Strikes Back?? David Duchovny was miscast in this flick. Every time I looked at him, I kept seeing agent Fox Mulder. Not his fault, however, he's a pretty good actor, and I enjoyed his humor in the X Files. This movie was disappointing. Some of the humor was funny, and the CGI monsters were fine, but the Ending is what ruined it for me. Why can't Hollywood come up with an original End Act for once?I gave this flick 6/10, partly for Mr Duchovny's performance, and partly for my favorite alien: the adorable (!) puppy dog with the huge innocent eyes.",Evolution
119,MrVibrating,"Great fun, good use of CGI.",6,25 April 2005,"The movie's big strengths were it's ""goriness""(a bad word but I can't find a better one)and the use of CGI. The actors were mostly boring and stereotypic, and the script was very silly. The setting is the classic we've seen so many times; A small town in USA is threatened by horrible monsters, this time aliens evolving extremely fast. The concept was surprisingly funny, and good use of CGI made the movie smooth and good-looking. Sometimes I was actually wondering if they'd used a doll or CGI. The jokes and the humour of the movie is a bit boring at times, but the imaginative aliens and the really stupid (and funny) ending balanced it. It was no masterpiece, but it's worth seeing sometime.",Evolution

121,dalton2,Good funny film.,7,13 July 2001,"I enjoyed this film. The special effects are quite good, and the actors do good performances: David Duchovny is ok (as always), Orlando Jones is very very funny (I like this man) and Dan Aykroyd is the funniest one for me. Julianne Moore is ok, too (she already did Jurassic Park 2 and has some experience on films of this kind).The script is well done, too. I could see that the writers had some science knowledge and didn't include senseless elements as in many expensive movies of today. I appreciate that very much, much more than the special effects. Back To The Future (1985) is a good example of what I mean.As a whole, I didn't get bored at any moment and I laughed many times. Don't miss it. 7 out of 10 for me.",Evolution
122,GuyCC,"The ""Ghostbusters 3"" We'll Never Get.",8,10 June 2001,"It seems everyone else has been making the same comparison as well.  Of course, *minor spoiler* our heroes fighting the bird alien in the mall is definitely the scene that makes the similarities seems more than a little coincidental. *end spoiler*.So basically, you have a film about a group of wacky university scientists running around and saving the world when no one seems to be able to.  And while this movie lacks some of the sly wit of ""Ghostbusters"", there were more than a few occasions that I laughed out loud at either a ridiculous situation, or a well-placed comment.  The special effects were really nice looking, and didn't seem out of place (i.e. a noticeable addition onto the frame).  But for the life of me, I can't remember any of the musical score. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it didn't make an impact, whatever it was.Okay, so the fate of the world rested in the hands of a well-placed product placement.  And yes, I thought the movie was pretty silly at times, sometimes too much for its own good.  But I think what pulled it all together for me, was the fact that it had an enjoyable cast (Duchovny and Jones were enjoyable, as was Scott, who was so goofy, it surprisingly actually worked for me), it's more than obvious similarities to ""Ghostbusters"" (one of my favorite film series from the '80's), and you know, this film was a blast to just turn off reality and sit back to have fun with.  I think that counts for something in itself.For all the Hollywood red tape, ""Ghostbusters 3"" may never see the light of day.  So I guess ""Evolution"" takes on a while different meaning, as this is the best (foreseeably for now) that fans are going to get to a sequel.I can live with that.",Evolution
123,Gambitt,theory of devolution,5,11 June 2001,"Evolution starts out promising, but gradually sinks in a sea of bad jokes and bad science.Granted, I didn't expect Bio 101.  Afterall, it's just a comedy.  But as farfetched as a sci-fi comedy wishes to be, it should at least strive for some degree of believability.  **Spoilers**So an asteroid hits, and the organisms start evolving at a rate several 1000x faster than normal.  Okay, whatever, I'll believe it.  The federal government discovers it so they send... the U.S. Army and one CDC representative?  Wouldn't there be a reaction of just a bit more magnitude? As fast as these organisms evolve, they still can't evolve to breathe oxygen.  They can evolve wings, fins, teeth, claws etc, but no oxygen lungs...  until they are already at ""dinosaur"" form. And then it just so happens that Duchovny and Jones happen to be there to witness the first organism that successfully evolves into an oxygen breather.As if the bad science wasn't bad enough, there is a fair degree of plain bad logic as well.  What about that method by which they discovered the magic ""formula"" for destroying the aliens?  All of this plot sloppiness ends up discrediting Duchovny's and Jones' characters as intelligent scientists.**end spoilers**So maybe I am being a bit too harsh and picky with the messy science. However, especially in the latter half, Evolution failed as a comedy as well.  When I saw this movie, a lot of the jokes and lines fell completely flat on a packed theatre of eager and willing movie-goers.  As with many mediocre movies trying to cover their butts, most of the funny moments are shown in the trailers.  By the end of the movie, it has completely degenerated into lowgrade slapstick.Jones' character has some potential to be an original role, but ends up being the classic goofy, dirty-minded, trash-talking black sidekick instead. Julianne Moore' character was pretty flat.  The audience laughed the first 2 or 3 times she tripped, but after that it got old.  The role of attractive, yet clutzy, female works sometimes, but Moore was a poor choice.Some of the visual effects are well done, though they're nothing special in today's movie market.  The cutesy monster was probably one of the most entertaining parts of the whole movie.In the end, Evolution is just cliche and predictable.  I don't mind cliche movies, as long as they are done well, which Evolution isn't.  If you think about it, there really are no surprises.  So my best advice is to try to not think as you watch this movie.  Just absorb it, but don't process it too much, much like those sea-sponges that suck in debris.  This might be difficult to do if you have more than a third-grade understanding of evolution.5 stars out of 10.",Evolution
124,rstef1,Missed Oppportunity,5,16 April 2007,"Wow. What a shame that Ivan Reitman had to direct this. In other hands this could have been a highly effective, and scary, sci-fi flick. The concept of alien organisms coming to earth and rapidly evolving, ultimately threatening all life on the planet, is a powerful and promising idea for a straightforward fright flick, especially when you have this kind of budget and the special effects are good as they are here.Unfortunately, Mr. Reitman decides to try to turn this into Ghostbusters 3, and drops the ball. None of the so-called humor works, and two of the actors, Orlando Jones and Seann William Scott, play it way too broadly for this kind of material. More laughs would have been had if they had played it straight.The first half is nearly intolerable, but picks up in the second half as the alien menace evolves and grows. Terrific special effects and well set up action sequences, like the scene in the mall, almost salvage this mess. David Duchovny and Julianne Moore do their best to no avail. With a better script that relied less on sophomoric humor and adolescent gags, and with stronger direction, this could have been a real winner.",Evolution

I didn't think I could take David 'X files' Duchovny in a comedy role, but he was fantastic and a was a really good start to his career in theatricalmovies (hopefully he can forget 'red shoe diaries' pretty soon). Orlando Jones was Ok in a token black guy role, with lots of funny (some racist) lines. Julianne moore didn't have much to do except fall down a lot.. why?

126,Oberrated,An old favorite of mine. Stupid humor movie but entertaining,5,15 October 2016,"Going in, if you watched a trailer or were aware of the cast or story, you would already know that it is far from a serious tone aside from knowing it is a comedy. While I would definitely label it what I call ""stupid humor"", I enjoyed it for what it was worth... Orlando Jones is by far my favorite part of the movie. Everything he says is comedic, even when it is purposefully meant to be funny or just straight shot. Some of his lines delivered made me laugh out loud when I was younger and even more so as I am older... At a younger age, I can clearly remember not being so critical of actors/actresses but now, quite the opposite, and I stand at an agreement as I always have been on Sean William Scott. He always plays the same character and has always gotten a simple pity laugh out of me as he always has. I can say I have only enjoyed him in 'The Rundown' but the constant stays true; he is the same character, different film.Overall, ignoring a comical dumb plot and some forced ""realizations"" throughout the movie. 'Evolution' is still an entertaining flick for me to sit down and just turn off my mind too. Pure stupid entertainment and fun. Nothing special to go crazy for. Still an old favorite of mine.",Evolution

He's a funny guy. 'Ghostbusters' was VERY funny. I've also heard 'Dave' and 'Kindergarten Cop' are good. Anyway, back to my review. 'Evolution' is a story of a meteor that crashes on to our planet, releasing aliens that evolve (thus the title of the movie). There are some really funny moments in this movie, including references to 'Alien' and 'The X-Files'. The cast is great; David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Sean William Scott, and Julianne Moore are all funny in their respective roles.

The characters were wafer-thin and irritating, although it seemed clear we were supposed to like them from the get-go. Not much chance of that, as they were a particularly vapid bunch.
The rehashed Ghostbusters plot was tired and - most criminally - devoid of anything remotely funny (yes, even the anal probe gags).Even the creature effects looked half-arsed.

But it went haywire when they let the military in and we had a combination of ""ET"" and ""Ghostbusters"" in terms of the way authority is depicted.Better they would have kept this at the community-college level where students come tracking in on a field trip to review the steady changes that are unfolding.David Duchovny clearly was breaking out of his ""X Files"" persona with this one and I don't know that he did himself any good.  He comes off as a likable type better suited for character parts than as a leading man.The problem with movies dependent on special effects is that they rarely know when to ease up.  The best stuff here was in the alien's formative stages with little creatures.  When you push ahead to dinosaurs, it's just ""Jurassic Park"" all over again.  And what was with the blue ape?  If this was a comedy, shouldn't the culminating creature been, well, funny?But then this was a forced comedy.  According to notes on this web site, the film was initially contemplated as a sci-fi thriller and converted to comedy.  Whoops--didn't work.  Julianna Moore as a klutz?  Not funny--just meaningless.But stupidity apparently rules the planet.  Think about the premise here--an alien life form sprouts in Arizona.  No one--not even the academics--care a fig to save it or study it.  It's as if everyone got tired about 2/3 the way through the film.  Ghostbuster alumnus Dan Ackroyd arrives as the imperious governor and all hell breaks loose ala that aforementioned ghost movie.

Enter: Evolution.We meet Dr. Ira Kane, a man whom combines the suave, obnoxious nature of Peter Venkman as transplants it into the brain of Egon Spengler. He, and his partner, Prof. Harry Phineas Block, work at a college, teaching classes. They get a rude awakening when a mysterious meteor slams in to the earth, unleashing an alien organism that evolves at a frighteningly rapid rate. With the help of Fire Fighter Wayne Grey (who is best described as the film's Ray Stanz), they band together to deal with the ever-changing alien menace, against orders from the Government, whom are trying their best to contain and study the situation.Every where you look in this movie, the Ghostbusters influence is heavy: Lots of cutting-edge (For the time) special effects shots, great characters, lots of sarcasm, and a little bit of scary monster movie guff; even Dan Aykroyd makes an appearance to get in on the fun. Unfortunately for us, it just doesn't connect on the same level as Ghostbusters did. The formula is almost exactly the same, right down to the Saturday Morning cartoon, but the polish just isn't there.That's not to say it's a bad movie. I really enjoyed myself, and it's unfortunate the movie tanked - I liked it enough to the point where I'd love to see a sequel, with Ira and his ""21st Century Ghostbusters"" traveling around, cleaning up the leftover evolutionaries.

I liked this movie the first time I watched it, and feeling nostalgic, I rented it again. Boy oh boy, what 6 years between viewings will do.This movie tries too hard. Tries to hard to be thought provoking, sci fi, comedy, and fails massively on all levels. I cannot believe Julianne Moore agreed to this, I guess i've had my palate spoiled by seeing her better movies. Orlando Jones plays a lecherous community college professor/women's athletic coach. The implications of him trying to get into the pants of barely legal college students dominates the movie, offers no plot point or advancement and leaves you with an awful taste in your mouth. Seann William Scott is being, well Seann William Scott. I can't say I was disappointed with him as he basically is playing the same character he does in everything else i've seen him in. This leads me to Duchovny.For an actor who was trying to distance himself from his work on the XFiles so he could spread his wings as an actor and explore different roles he sure didn't go to far. He goes from playing Sci-fi alien butt kicking Agent Fox Mulder to playing Sci-Fi alien butt kicking Ira Kane. The only real difference in the characters is occupation, name and partners (replace Scully with Orlando Jones.) Way to go David! (And no, he shouldn't live that down!!)Here's all you need to know: Aliens are undergoing Evolution at an alarming speed, and threatening to wipe out life as we know it. Enter Fox Mulder, the pervert coach, Stifler, Moore and Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dumb. (2 students who are also volunteer firemen.) Out of all the people on the planet, they figure out how to kill the aliens. And they do, in one of the most laughable, badly done, anti-climatic CGI effect you've ever seen. That being done, Mulder & Moore disappear to get it on in a nearby firetruck. The End. Oh, there's also a big product placement for Head & Shoulders. If it sounds dumb, that's because it is. This coming from the man who brought us ""GhostBusters"", a far superior film in both story and effects. If you're really hankering down for some good Sci Fi or Alien type of things, i'll suggest to you the actual ""XFiles"". There's 9 seasons of them to pick from where you can watch Duchovny in his original alien seeking, conspiracy theorist paranormal investigator role. 2/10 for Moore and for Seann William Scott, who is at least not pretending to be anyone else.",Evolution

There are few jokes in the film, and none where you do anything more but smile (with maybe the exception of scenes with the two fat blokes).  The good and relaxed spirit between the actors saved a lot though.  I think the film should have been longer, with less monsters and more humor.

Orlando Jones is tortured by gross means as has only happened to black sidekicks many times before (and since).

What's worse is that so many of the actors try make bland material seem hysterical. It's a wasted effort and it's almost embarassing to see them try so hard. A good example is Dan Aykroyd, who doesn't utter one funny line his entire time on screen. Clearly someone thought his one liners would be hysterical but they were gag inducing. It's full of cliches, wasted characters (Sean William Scott is a GREAT man to have around in a comedy but he has nothing to do in this movie), and some pretty bad acting all around.

Once you´ve seen the trailers, you´ve seen the funny bits. 5/10",Evolution
151,sarcasm_for_free,Not exactly the 'Evolution' of comedy.,5,15 February 2021,"Evolution is not a particularly good movie, but there's always something to be said for a film where everyone seems to have had a ball making it... both behind and in front of the camera. Sadly, whatever plus points there might be here tend to be overshadowed by the lack of wit and grating silliness on offer, thus dooming the final product to the inauspicious realms of forgettable mediocrity.Here's what you need to know about the cast and director: Ivan Reitman tries remaking Ghostbusters but for aliens. David Duchovny plays an ever-so-slightly more social version of Fox Mulder. Orlando Jones is a stereotypical crazy black guy with obvious jokes to match. Sean William Scott tries to move away from the 'stifling' success of Stifler... and fails. Julianne Moore is a clumsy redhead genius scientist who of course gets a lot more attention for her looks than brains...Yep, this is early 00's comedy in a nutshell... complete with all the PG-compatible butt and sex jokes you could possibly want (or not). I might have my own problems with the censorious age we live in now where anyone can be shut down for saying the 'wrong' thing, but at least we seem to have moved on in terms of the tired old comedic tropes. Mostly, anyway.Another problem here is the outdated special effects... this may have had a budget of 80 million dollars at the time, but now most parts look less impressive than a PS3 cutscene. These aliens aren't lovably goofy or memorably designed, they are just disgusting to look at and uninteresting to watch. Fortunately, we don't see too many of them until the end. Guess that ginormous budget didn't stretch all that far in the end.Oh yes, the ending. Some will find it absolutely hilarious and inspired, others will think it abrupt, stupid and just plain unsatisfying. I, as you can probably guess, am firmly in the latter camp, but considering what came before was not all that shocked to see proceedings conclude on such a bizarre note.Ultimately, despite my above criticism, Evolution is just light and frothy enough to be worth watching once, as a bit of undemanding entertainment. Just don't blame me if you can't recall anything about it a few days from now. 5/10",Evolution

The same federal stupidity, alien stories, with some new computer made effects. Jurassic park imitations are flying around in a store. Also, the best way to be a fireman... is to kill an alien with shampoo. The final scene is dirty, a huge throw-up, which of course hits the ""bad guy"". The commercials in movies suck big time.

Thankfully I'm wrong about this and find myself laughing throughout the movie. That's not to say that this film ranks top tier in comedies of all time, but it definitely lodges itself as a guilty pleasure comedic flick. The story is about Ira (David Duchovny) and Harry (Orlando Jones), two community college professors, who are the first to investigate a meteor that crashed to Earth. The meteor brings with it basic alien life forms. Wayne (Seann William Scott), a want to be firefighter who discovered the meteor, and Allison (Juilianne Moore), a klutzy government scientist, join Ira and Harry to combat the alien organisms that have been rapidly evolving since their arrival on Earth.It is a simple script with not many twists or turns, but the thing that gets me every time is the chemistry between the actors. Duchovny, Jones, and Moore are the heavy weights in this film and they bring great skill to the table. Wile it is a straight forward film with not a lot of surprises the one thing that you can depend on is great situational dialogue. The movie doesn't rely on gross out humor or shock value but rather on well crafted scenes that allow for mature comedic dialogue. And at the end of the day I'm always down to watch this movie once a year just for some good fun.",Evolution

I feel it could have been a little more creative at times but the humour was very good. I just found a few weak points where things could have been a little more fun, like at the ending, they should have have had the fire truck 'rocking' and Duchovny shouting something like 'OMG, did I ever underestimate you!' or something like that. I mean if you're going to get campy then why not go all the way, especially right at the very end!Acting: 10 out of 10 on all accounts - ALL of the actors were great. The chemistry between David Duchovny , Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott, and Julianne Moore really worked and was believable which is hard to come by. And again, all the other actors did great.The overall look (filming) and special effects: 10 out of 10
Nothing wrong here - looked great and special effects were amazing.The Musical score stood out the most to me, I give it a solid 10 out of 10: John Powell hit it out of the park. I used to do music tracks so I know what's involved and this guy is GREAT - and looking at his track record, it's no wonder he's gotten the gigs he has. The score for the whole film is fantastic but the shopping mall score but especially when the elevator comes up from the depths and the ensuing craziness really jumps out.

To see another alien-monster movie of this calibre was certainly a pleasure and a privilege.  Allow me to also state that I rate my movies on entertainment value, not that artistic crap or plausibility (after all, when dealing with alien DNA, what is plausible?). David Duchovny and Orlando Jones starred as a pair of goof-ball scientists (a biologist and geologist, respectively) who wanted to use the meteor fragment (teeming with only microscopic life at the time) as a get-rich-quick scheme. The creatures were very imaginative; everything was incredible.  The movie started off with the asteroid entering Earth's atmosphere and took little time to get the story/plot well underway.  Not only that, but mix in a little humour and action, and the end result was an extremely fun movie to watch and enjoy. All in all, I gave it a 10 because I really liked this movie.  Also, a sequel starring David and Orlando would be fantastic.  A sequel could be possible because after all, the asteroid broke into several chunks.  David and Orlando could then be called into the scene, since they would be known as the foremost experts of dealing with these creatures (I assume that as a biologist and hero, David's character would have an opportunity to study these creatures further).",Evolution

Even Eight-Legged Freaks.... These films have fun with a history of monster b-movies and don't take themselves too seriously. However, do you know what the difference between Evolution and those films is? Those are actually good. Just because something is corny, satirical, and lighthearted does not mean its content is in anyway good. Evolution is terrible. It's not funny in the slightest. Its characters are revolting. It's effects are pathetic. It lacks any cleverness in anything, even in its attempts at satire. It's funny that one of our leads is perving on the underage athletes he coaches, right? It's hilarious that the leading lady spends most of the film being mocked for being frigid, and is subjected to sexist writing, isn't it? I wouldn't consider myself horribly sensitive, but this film was tasteless back in 2001 and it's tasteless now. It relies too heavily on CGI monsters that have no weight and appear in uninspired action scenes. I kept waiting for the film to be funny, but it never was. What's clever about a dragon chasing down a shoplifter we were introduced to a minute ago leading to her swearing off theft altogether? What's funny about a mosquito going in a man's butthole? This film feels like it was written by teenagers for teenagers, rather than by monster enthusiasts for monster enthusiasts.

159,timelord-3,Patchy but reasonably enjoyable,7,11 July 2001,"I really hate going to see movies that do nothing but remind me of other movies.  Now I don't mind the odd knowing wink or sly dig at a genre or series of movies, but when you decide to rip off wholesale what already has been a winning formula and just give it another title that is when I get a little annoyed.Evolution, if you haven't already worked it out from the trailers and publicity, is pretty much a rehash of the Ghostbusters formula.  Which is not surprising considering the creative team behind the two films.So in Evolution we have a group of misfits out to save the world from the dirty aliens.  A meteorite crashes in the desert and begins to spawn off an amazing variety of nasty creatures that seem hell bent on destroying the good 'ole US of A.Our three hapless heroes (Duchovny,  Orlando Jones, Seann William Scott) are the first to make the discovery, which is quickly and rudely taken away from them by some nasty, nasty army intelligence types (Ted Levine).But of course it soon transpires that our underdogs are really the ones with all the clues and the inside line on ridding the earth of these nasty speedily-evolved critters.Evolution unfortunately is not the sum of its parts; a film made up of a series of set pieces that do not really tie together well or even work well on their own.Many of the gags and situations fall flat primarly because of Duchovny's bizarre sense of comic timing - they ar e only saved because Orlando plays such an over the top character that it hides much of Duchovny's faults.Once our three heroes are allowed to shake the movies tendency to play it straight for the first 30 minutes it truly starts to shine.  They initially seem confined by the need to get across the necessary exposition before they are allowed to truly stretch their wings and enjoy themselves; and allow the audience to finally get some good laughs.Julianne Moore as the scientist with a heart of gold is probably one of the most miscast parts this year - she is truly at sea in this film and her characters tendency for clumsiness only makes this reviewer more bewildered about her inclusion other than somebody for Duchovny to eye off.The CGI on the whole ranges from average to good - you get one scene of dazzling work only to be confronted the next scene with some truly ordinary effects.On the whole Evolution isn't that bad - it just could have been a whole lot better.7.5 out of 10.",Evolution

Two scientists from the local community college (David Duchovny, Orlando Jones) get wind of the happening, and on arriving at the scene, discover a few curiosities about the meteor - not least of which is the appearance of alien life.  What's more, it's alien life that's evolving at a dramatic rate.  As ever, Big Brother is watching, and the military's scientific team (including Julianne Moore) get in on the act.  As the army aren't known for their sense of restraint, it all leads to an explosive finale, that'll make you think twice about your brand of dandruff shampoo.One of the things that makes this movie great is that it works, not just as a roaring comedy, but as a sci-fi thriller.  In fact, if half the script was slightly modified, and the roles were played a bit straighter, it would be a real edge-of-the-seater, because the narrative is spot on.  Highlights include Julianne Moore as the rather clumsy love-interest (come on, you know you love slapstick really), and Orlando Jones as the excitable and unfortunate professor/volleyball coach.  Look out for an old-skool comedy star's turn as the state governor as well.

He expressed some of the mix of desperation, anger, but mainly disbelieving shock I experienced when confronted with actors I loved involved in a *non-movie*.I'm really trying hard to find something positive to say. The special effects sometimes were good. In certain action scenes, sometimes there was rhythm. Some brief shots of Julianne Moore smiling were nice.But what is worse than a movie trying to be funny. Sometimes you hear dialog that is perfectly funny - potentially. And somehow, the movie manages to choke it to flat-line. Bad editing, bad directing for the actors: both Duchovny and Moore have nothing to prove... and let's not even recall Dan Ayckroyd also got entangled in this mess somehow.

But it's only a matter of time before the meteor begins to take shape and begins evolving years beyond any normal evolution. Leaving the three men and a government scientist to stop it.The Review: ""Evolution"" was made in the midst of the impending actors strike, which never came to fruition. So the feeling that it may have been a rushed project is fine. The film is the latest in a long line of comedies to feature gross jokes, such as an alien anal probe, mooning, and pulling out a bug where the sun don't shine among many others. It plays off as a kind of ""Ghostbusters"" with a different twist. Mind you, Dan Aykroyd pops up in an unbilled role as a state governor. The special effects are quite impressive involving CGI aliens and creatures. The film is pure slapstick with the sci-fi twist. However, what's not good about ""Evolution"" is it feels half-assed, therefore reitering the point that this film was a rushed project. It feels like it was sped up for the benefits of cashing in but the film flopped at the box office. The ending is capped on and it just doesn't feel satisfactory. But on the other hand, ""Evolution"" is a funny movie because it relies on the chemistry between David Duchovny, giving Fox Mulder a dynamic personality, in which his character moons a government official, and Orlando Jones (The 7UP guy) as Duchovny's spastic best friend, a geology professor who's also a women's volleyball coach.

The script is so absolutely awful (especially compared to earlier films by the director) that I'm incredulous that no one at Columbia pulled the plug on this mess early on, let alone greenlighted the project.  One suspects that only the force of Ivan Reitman's past commercial blockbusters got this picture in front of a camera.The special effects are good, the cast is gallant in trying to get through the dialogue, but in the end the total failure of the material kills this flik so bad it's spirit could be zapped by the Ghostbusters. The thing most missing from this erzatz ""GhostbustersIII"" is the writing of Harold Ramis who, it is very clear to me now, was the true genius behind the best Reitman films (i.e., Animal House, Ghostbusters).I have pretty low expectations when I go to see a mindless summer time comedy; Entertain me a little for my seven bucks.

Actually when I rented it, I was worried it might be some stupid movie with bad acting and bad directing, but I couldn't have been more wrong about it.  Orlando Jones was absolutely hilarious (who knew the 7-up guy could act so well), while David Duchovny added that ""off the wall"" dry humor which blended perfectly with Jones. And then to top it off, Julianne Moore's (from Hannibal) character was hysterical in an offbeat style as well.  As for Sean William Scott, he basically played the same role he usually plays in all of his movies, the ""idiot"", but nobody in acting pulls that off as well as he does.  He's a riot!  Granted, this movie is not Saving Private Ryan or The Green Mile, but for a cheesy comedy that is just supposed to make you laugh, it's at the top of it's genre.The movie deals with an asteroid which strikes the Earth, but it is no ordinary asteroid.  This asteroid brought single cells with it, but for some reason these cells are multiplying at- a high rate of speed.  As time goes on, the cells become more advanced evolving from single celled organisms to multi-celled organisms and so forth.  Don't get the wrong idea though, this movie is more about just being funny, than it is about sci-fi, or even evolution for that matter.  Granted, the cells evolve into much more complex beings, but really folks, it's just a comedy to take your mind off of life for awhile.  If you want something to make you laugh, then I highly recommend Evolution.",Evolution

David Duchovny (forgive me if I mispelled his name) is, surprisingly, a pretty good comedic actor.  He was, for the most part, the straight man in this movie (the guy who stands by and looks on while the comic relief person is constantly cutting up).The only thing I strongly disliked about this movie was the obvious assumption it made that fat people are stupid.  The two students in the college class that were stupid were very overweight, and they were constantly played out to be lazy, stupid, beer-guzzling good-for-nothings. The only saving grace of this obvious stereotyping was they knew where to find something important toward the end of the movie when none of the other characters knew where to get it.",Evolution
185,spazierganger,"Good, entertaining summer comedy",6,9 June 2001,"""Evolution,"" though not the most original movie ever, is still a very entertaining comedy. Although the story uses some cliches, it uses them well, and so it's not really a problem. The three main characters (Duchovny, Jones, and Scott) are fairly typical underdog hero types. However they are all very funny, and some of the comedy is far better that a lot of recent comedies. Going in, you're going to have a pretty good idea how it ends, of course, it's getting to that ending that makes this movie good. For instance, you know that our heroes will come up with some ingenious method to stop the aliens, but in ""Evolution,"" they come up with an idea (which I won't spoil) that is also very funny. The script for ""Evolution"" is far better than many recent comedies. There are quite a few witty conversations between the characters that go beyond the typical slapstick, shock-oriented humor that has become popular of late. That said, the film does occasionally lapse into some gross-out humor (like an extended fart gag near the end), but fortunately there's not too much of it, and there's enough of the more intelligent comedy to make up for it.The acting in ""Evolution"" was also quite good. David Duchovny proves that he can do comedy, and in a way, almost mocks his ""X-Files"" character in this movie. He deadpans many of his lines, but his timing is good, and so this works for great comedic effect, instead of being boring. I was especially impressed with Orlando Jones, who was not only very funny, but proved that he could be serious at times. Jones actually had some of the lines that made me laugh the most. He's one of the few comedians who's acting skills constantly impress me. Seann William Scott is pretty good as well, though he does play basically play the same character he's played in many of his films. He seems like he could be a pretty good actor, I'd love to see him try something different. Julianne Moore is, of course, a very talented actress, and brings as much to her role as she can. Her character is, however, the least developed of the four, and so she doesn't really shine here, but she at least manages to keep her character from seeming too one dimensional.Overall, I enjoyed ""Evolution."" It's not perfect; there's a few plot holes and a few of the jokes misfire. Most of them, however, do not, and the movie manages to become an entertaining, well-acted, summer comedy. And even if you DON'T like the movie, you'll still love the special effects. So go see it...there's plenty of worse things you could do to kill a couple hours.Rating: 8/10",Evolution

The film manages to be funny by taking itself very seriously. Not nearly as good a satire as ""Airplane,"" I'll admit, but still a great sendup of alien infection movies. The only problem I had was the casting of David Duchovny in the lead role; I felt he was trying much too hard to be funny, which is of course the fastest way not to be funny.

194,moonlightreflections,X marks the hole.,6,9 June 2001,"Depending on the degree of a viewer's intelligence, you may find certain words to be included in an opinion of this movie.  In a descending order, they are:ProctologistFlatulenceAssConstipation may also fit somewhere in there.""Evolution"" is a movie that prompts us to question the mentality of the movie-making process.  I figure that there could have been two possible scenarios when the producers were preparing for this movie.  The first one must have involved the idea of rapidly-evolving extraterrestrial lifeforms invading earth;  after the idea was realized, perhaps somebody decided to include a bunch of ass jokes.  Or, scenario number 2:""I want to make a movie with a lot of ass jokes.  What scenario could we develop to fit these jokes into?""""How about aliens invading earth?  The king alien could have a really huge ass and blow everything to smithereens with sheer willpower.  We could then have a couple scientists attempt to clog up the problem.""""I like it!""Fortunately, somewhere along the line somebody decided to make it tasteful, or either PG-13 friendly, so what we get here is nowhere near as crass as most of today's R-rated comedies.  But it still leaves a little something to be desired when jokes revolve in and out around the same idea.Sometimes, the performances of the main characters are enough to salvage a film;  in the case of ""Evolution,"" the main roles give the movie a type of innocent air that luckily makes it both enjoyable and exciting.  David Duchovny plays Ira Kane, a former government scientist who after an unfortunate turn of events became a community college biology professor. Along with Harry Block (Orlando Jones), one of the other resident ""scientists"" of the college, they set out to investigate a peculiar meteor crash out in the Arizona desert.After taking a few samples, they realize that the cells retrieved from the meteor are multiplying at an alarming rate, completing an evolutionary process that would normally take aeons in just a few hours.  They then go back to the meteor crash to pursue their findings, only to find the military involved and casting them out of the project.  So, along with an aspiring firefighter (Wayne Green) and the military's head scientist (Julianne Moore), they head out to expunge the aliens from their planet, no questions asked.The chemistry between Duchovny and Jones is what makes the movie shine, keeping it continuously fresh despite its inherent banality.  There are a few missed opportunities that in the end truly detracted from the overall grade, however.  The first is that during potentially funny situations, absolutely nothing was done to lighten the mood of the narrative;  the first thirty minutes of the film can very well lead you to believe that you're going to be watching a drama if you don't know what the movie is about in the first place.  The second missed opportunity comes in the form of the aliens.  Though featured in more than a couple of scenes, they never managed to constitute a sensation of dread.  Jump-out-of-your-seat scenes, yes;  but there never really was an established danger to humanity to justify wiping them out in the manner that the movie's characters do, unless you consider flying reptiles taking young girls for a stroll in the mall a grave danger.In the end, ""Evolution"" misses the target by a couple of meters.  Nevermind that the characters involved are all caricatures;  it's what this type of movie mandates, and manages to work in really well.  Forget about the cheesy special effects or the lame reactions to the CG extraterrestrials.  The problem here is that in order to work in a few good bellylaughs, the story sets up for them in a ho-hum fashion that incorporates any type of bathroom humor conceivable.  It's enjoyable, but considering how much the stars improved this picture to begin with, a good screenplay could have worked marvels.6/10",Evolution

This tries SO HARD to be Men in Black (in a different tailored suit), only it lacks the inspiration and the humor.

Pretty run of the mill really.Some credit had to be given to the actors. Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott had me in stitches. David Duchovny, whom I've never really seen in a comedy role, was OK. He was very adept at applying himself to the more childish aspects of his role, for instance when he was arguing with his ex about her stealing his shirts, but was completely unconvincing as a scientist or a romantic.The single biggest thing that let this film down was the script. I laughed out loud about twice. Most of the time I was waiting for the next interesting or funny thing to happen. I spent a lot of time waiting I can tell you. Quite frankly, the jokes were thin on the ground and the majority of them expected you to laugh at words like 'loogie' or the fact that one of characters is black so therefore has more rhythm than his white friends by default.This film doesn't cut the mustard as a comedy - there are much funnier films out there. Neither could it be called a science fiction - it has a sort of self-parodying B-movie plotline. The only appeal it has is to those who are easily impressed by adolescent humour, because that's one thing it does have.The market for this film I can see as being largely confined to those of about 15 and under because I would have loved this sort of thing when I was that age.

211,Artifam,Still no Evolution since Ghostbusters,5,22 November 2018,"Coming to Evolution just shy of two decades since its release you have to consider that it is a product of its time. The effects aren't bad, the story-line is fair, there plenty of gags to make you laugh, but the sexism is cringe worthy. You don't need to be a feminist to find the 'locker talk' between Harry and Ira a bit crass. An early scene where student Nadine is flaunting herself to secure a higher grade with professor Harry is a little dubious, but made all the more creepy for Ira's buddy banter afterwards. It's as if Reitman has tried to create parallels to Ghostbusters in Evolution with this scene designed to replicate Venkman's electric shock psychic card game where he cheekily manipulates the game to get a date with the girl with no ability and electrifies the poor chump actually guessing correctly, which is also probably sexist by definition but funny because the joke is on the guy and Venkman's connivance. Back to Evolution though we also have scientist Allison falling over and revealing a sexy suspender through a slit in her dress with no function to the scene and equally Allison has a propensity to fall and bump into things continuously as the bumbling brainy babe with no rationale behind it either. The characterisations feel very dated and there's also plenty of 'Black man' references, which although still perpetuated in films starring Will Ferrell or Kevin Hart for example, just aren't funny in the modern world outside of the US. What's worse is that Harry actually appears to be the only man of colour in the whole film, which makes the gags more poignant. It's perhaps ironic that Ghostbusters, made in 1984, has dated so much better (in a graceful way) and is still sharply funny and hugely entertaining movie. Evolution is still fairly fun to watch, but is a film that leaves you feeling indifferent to having watched it, i.e. neither particularly impressed nor disappointed.",Evolution

Set in Northeast Arizona (in Page, in fact, although this fact was never mentioned once in the movie), the plot centers around the arrival of an alien-microbe filled meteor that crashes near Glen Canyon, whose inhabitants begin to evolve and destroy at an ever increasing rate.Orlando Jones is hilarious as the ""professor"" who relishes the idea of getting credit for the discovery. David Duchovny looks like he wants to be in another movie, however.  As the serious professor who is interested researching these aliens, he seems uncomfortable with the tweaking of his X-Files personae and mostly just looks constipated thru most of the film.
Julianne Moore's role is a throwaway, a humiliating comic scientist whose total ""humorous"" input into the film is that she trips alot.Ivan Reitman has created a lesser film that is nevertheless amusing and entertaining while watching it.  Just don't think about it too much afterwards or the Semitruck sized plot holes will be all too evident.",Evolution

It says in the IMDb notes that Reitman took over the script to make it more of a comedy: he didn't succeed, it's totally lame and not funny at all. If rectal humor is supposed to be funny then I'm out of the loop, happily. The mall scenes are just not funny, the guy singing is just bad and the story is just trying too hard, the heroes just bust into the rifle rack and take over the area while the security guards just run amok, not knowing what to do (they probably read the script), where were the police? The best part of the movie was the actor named Levine, he's quite a screen presence, if you're good you can overcome all sorts of script deficiencies. It's mind boggling to me that the writers thought that a alien with diarrhea is funny and then depict it so descriptively and sickeningly (if they spent more of their time on the story?????). I understand Ducovney took this picture over a Star Wars flick (I know: a big fish in a small pond is better than a small fish in a big pond), bad choice.",Evolution

The cast are all excellent with David Duchovny proving that he is very much capable of doing comedy (as regular viewers of ""The X Files"" will already know), Orlando Jones was great too, a new name to me and probably most people in the UK too! David and Orlando made a great and very funny comic duo and I'd love to see them work together again.Seann William Scott was also cool, playing a role that we've seen him play before but that didn't stop him being funny!

225,0rbita1,"Vaguely entertaining sci-fi spoof, but it's no MIB.",5,10 July 2001,"Isn't evolution just a great idea.  Think for a second - without it, we'd all be a floppy race of fish people, eating plankton and not tuna, in case it used to be a relative.  Charles Darwin truly is the daddy. However, the rest of creation hasn't caught on to the advantages of the idea yet. Personally, I think slugs are just lazy and should try harder to grow arms and legs like normal species.Such an accusation can be aimed at 'Evolution' the movie. A sci-fi comedy in the same vein as the far superior Men In Black, Reitman has simply remade Ghostbusters and replaced the ghosts with aliens. 'No bad thing', you might say. After all, Ghostbusters was a classic of its time and a thoroughly entertaining film. Yet, the second time round, it just seems as though he couldn't be bothered to advance the plot any further and the formula simply doesn't work as well.It's a promising if unoriginal premise. A meteorite lands on outskirts of small town, local scientists with shady past discover it before a government cover up, culminating in much chaos and eventual showdown (pick your 50s B-movie). Yet the plot is laboured and poorly developed, and it takes an age to get moving. Unlike its more illustrious predecessor, 'Evolution' has no 'big scene' until two-thirds of the way into the film, and often has to rely on the charisma of its lead actors to keep it moving. This wouldn't be a problem if Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd et al were on hand - but they're not (Akroyd actually has a cameo late on in the film, just to remind you of what it's missing). Orlando Jones and David Duchovny (not the most charismatic of actors at the best of times) try hard with an inoffensive and occasionally witty script, but are defeated by its sheer predictability. As for Julianne Moore's attempts at slapstick - spare me. Even the effects, one of the main selling points of the film, are nothing special. True, some of the creatures look great, but perhaps someone should tell the FX man from Jurassic Park (on set here yet again) that too many dinosaurs can eventually get a little boring? Despite this, 'Evolution' does have its moments. The Alien gestation spoof is genuinely funny, as is the alien dinosaur chase through the Mall. Orlando Jones is good throughout (though no Chris Rock), and Duchovny shows enough to suggest that he may make it on the big screen after all. Yet, with MIB available for half the price and twice the laughs (and Ghostbusters for even less), it's hard to get too excited about such an average film. Mildly entertaining, but no more.5/10",Evolution

231,Catalyst-3,"Nothing huge, just an entertaining movie",10,1 July 2001,"As a hard-core fan of The X-Files, I was, of course, obligated to see this movie due to David Duchovny's presence.  Although I hadn't been expecting much, I found myself pleasantly surprised--it's fairly funny and has a nicely developed sci-fi plot.Evolution reminds me of a film called Home Fries more than anything, actually.  It's not really a laugh-out-loud comedy.  It's comedy that makes you smile as it keeps you engaged in the relatively serious plot that is the core of the film.  (Ironically, Home Fries was written by Vince Gilligan, who is the best writer for The X-Files, IMHO, and has written many of the series's more comedic episodes--and it's thanks to those episodes of The X-Files that we've gotten a taste of David Duchovny's comedy acting talent before.  I was glad to see he was able to exhibit one of his strengths in this film.)As for the other performances, they were great.  Julianne Moore was hysterical--she's got talent for physical comedy.  Orlando Jones was a little too wide-eyed and wild at times, but other than that managed to credibly play his role (particularly during the insect extraction scene).If there's any complaint I can have, it's that the romance seemed rather tacked-on.  (Just like the final scene of The X-Files's season finale, hmm!) It really didn't add anything to the film, and the two actors involved didn't have any romantic chemistry.  Also, the butt jokes went a little too far.  One was an obvious reference to Independence Day, but it was still gratuitous and over-the-top.Despite its flaws, I think Evolution is a fine film.  It's probably not going to get anyone an Academy Award, but it's good when you want something that is pure entertainment.",Evolution
232,ScarletArmkreuz,Why do people always expect classics?,8,10 June 2001,"I don't understand why everyone on here expects *every* movie to be a classic, intelligently written movie.  After seeing such disgusting 'comedies' (note that the term is used loosely) as Scary Movie, American Pie, and others that my acquaintances around here seem to have loved, I, for one, am thrilled to see a comedy that, while containing some gross humor, isn't mired in the sophomoric humor that has become standard for the day. 
This movie isn't a classic comedy.  Compared to Ghostbusters (as it inevitably will be), it comes out about even in my opinion.  Compared to Men In Black (a comparison that has shown up here, but for the life of me, I can't figure out why), it's better. Men In Black couldn't seem to decide whether it was a comedy or a serious movie, and this movie embraces the comedy. The plot is cliched, yes.  The aliens 'evolution' doesn't seem to follow a real pattern, and some of the lesser creatures were much more frightening than the ones in the later parts of the movies.  The creatures aren't particularly well designed.  But, as far as killing a few hours, I can think of worse ways to do it.",Evolution
233,jayhonk,Funnier than they think,7,10 August 2003,"Alot of people are mentioning Ghostbusters, this movie rates between Ghostbusters I and GBII.  Alot closer to GBII. I gave it a 7 of 10 because it IS a funny movie.  I can't believe one reviewer said they should have played it straight.  The problem with the movie is that the story line of the discoverers vs. the Army kind of flip flops between who is advocating what, regarding what to do with the aliens. In the end, you just roll with it to see what happens.  Any way, David Duchovny and Orlando Jones did fine, Duchovny played his part with a dry sense of humor, while Jones could have used some funnier lines. Sean William Scott did a great job with his part, the lovable goof. Juliane Moore isn't going to make anyones favorite actor list based on this movie, not her fault, the part was kind of lame.  Dan Aykkroyd came on as the governor of Arizona toward the end and spewed hilarious bombast like the Aykroyd of old. I can't believe that some said there were no funny scenes in this flick: the shotguns in the mall was real fun and Aykroyd's scenes were worth the price of admission. Good but not great, I would recommend it.",Evolution
234,aorman,Science-fiction or comedy? Misses as both.,3,15 August 2001,"One can't talk about this film without referring to Ghostbusters (1984). And it's not hard, because a number of elements seem to have found their way from Ghostbusters into Evolution - the strong female lead, the wacky professional scientists, the ""won't listen"" man in charge, and Dan Aykroyd. Ghostbusters was an ensemble piece, three comedians who had worked together for a long time and who could play off one another. Not so with evolution. So much of the friendly banter seems forced and artificial, and Orlando Jones' cliched one-liners only slow the scenes down. Something was wrong with the editing, though I found it hard to put my finger on it - like the editors (both experienced people, I might add) had left a few too many frames on either side of a cut. Other scenes - such as the argument over the shirt between Duchovny and his ex in the cafe - felt like they shouldn't have been there at all. It was clear seeing the end sequence that great chunks of the film had been removed, but whether they were the right chunks you'll have to decide for yourself. The effect is a slow and choppy film. Now, it is supposed to be a comedy, but a little scientific accuracy wouldn't go astray. Not some argument over the atomic weight of Nitrogen, but something as simple as ""these creatures can't possibly survive in our atmosphere..."" We got some of it, but not much, and what we did get left me shaking my head in bewilderment. I assumed that was what Scott's character was there for - to have things explained so the audience would understand. As it turned out, Scott's presence was essentially a plot device. The best bit? Aykroyd's appearance. He waltzes onto the set and out-acts everybody on screen, and looks like he has a lot more fun doing it too. Only Julianne Moore manages to match his enthusiasm. Duchovny's character seems to pull the solution to their problem out of thin air, which grates badly. These characters aren't smart, they're lucky. Disappointing? You betcha. And not just because of the high standards set by Ghostbusters. This film has its own set of problems.",Evolution

236,lloyd219,A Lost Opportunity,6,25 June 2001,"Evolution has one of the strongest Sci Fi plotlines I've encountered in a movie for some time. A premise that had the potential to develop into a truly great film. Unfortunately very little of this potential is ever realised on screen. Instead what we end up with is a Porkys meets Independence Day mish mash that does nothing for the careers of anyone involved on set.Guys if you're going to do a teen comedy please don't use a good storyline like this. Do a Tim Burton and shoot a 'Mars Attacks'. I like others here wonder why Duchovny ever agreed to be in this film. Most of his time he plays the part of a lame straight man while the buffoons around him react to a possible alien invasion by cracking bad one liners and doing infantile sight gags. And the supposed love interest between Duchovny & Moore looked like it was cut and pasted in from a B grade script writing programme.   
In spite of the fore mentioned Evolution wasn't the worst film I've seen this year. It did have it's amusing moments and the special effects were spectacular. I just would have liked to have seen this film made by someone like Ridley Scott.

As much as I love ""Ghost Busters"" I and II, this is a movie I can watch over and over again.The set designs and special effects are fantastic. The music by John Powell is dynamic and thrilling. The chemistry between the characters is delightful, including the two fat guys who turn out to be far more intelligent than the audience realizes. Dan Aykroyd is fabulous as the governor of Arizona. Every line he utters is hysterical. Dan improvised most of them during filming.The film works perfectly as a comedy, but it also works extremely well as a sci-fi adventure/thriller. In fact, the story was originally conceived as a serious sci-fi thriller, but director Ivan Reitman wisely realized that a comic version would be much better. As one of the millions of intelligent people who realize that the theory of evolution is actually just a joke that Charles Darwin never intended for anybody to take seriously, this movie does a fabulous job of demonstrating just how ridiculous it is to believe that complex lifeforms could ""accidentally"" develop from simpler organisms. (Just try demonstrating this moronic idea in the laboratory. Good luck, pal . . . )As a true fan of the best of the 1950s sci-fi films, ""Evolution"" is the perfect ancestor to movies like the Harryhausen classics like ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" and ""20 Million Miles to Earth"", and director Jack Arnold's two best films, ""It Came from Outer Space"", and ""The Space Children"".Ironically, the people who criticize this movie often seem to do so because they object to the fact that the ""science"" is inaccurate. Ivan Reitman states on the commentary track of the DVD that he took great pains to get the science in he story correct, including the use of science advisors. It's obvious that these people's objections are based on their pathetic defense of the totally illogical ""theory of evolution"" (pause for chuckle).It you don't like ""Evolution"", try rethinking your personal philosophies.

Evolution is a movie that accomplishes what it set out to do--make you laugh.  Ivan Reitman wasn't trying to garnish Oscars with this film; he was trying to entertain America for a couple of hours.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  Isn't that what movies are supposed to do?  When we go to the movies we want to escape the mundane trials of life.

OK, I'm a big X Files fan, but Duchovny isn't known for his prowess in Films. I also find Julianne Moore to be aesthetically pleasing. I knew nothing about Orlando Jones, but Seann William Scott is a young actor on the Teen Movie scene. I loved American Pie and Road Trip. Indeed, Evolution tries to use the Teen feel, as the original scenes are based around two college lecturers in an American High School. The ""school"" jokes come thick and fast at the start, but they are are original and funny. On the whole I have to say that much of this film left me in stitches. It's easy humour with Dan Ayckroyd thrown in. Ted Levine (The cross dressing Psychopath from Silence of the Lambs) is disturbing in a comedy role, but he just about gets away with it, in his ""foil"" role in this film, playing the bad guy against the rapid fire wit. Obviously, Duchovny is used to ham up his X Files role, which he does very successfully. It's often hard not to imagine Moore with her kit off in Boogie Nights, but not to bad as the first time I've seen her in a comedy role. On the whole, I laughed a lot. It's a mickey take, it's Caddyshack, it's a teen movie mixed with Sci Fi idiocy. Try comparing it with Galaxy Quest, another film I found to be amusing and thoroughly absorbing.

I went out of it totally satisfied. The team of Orlando Jones, David Duchovny and Seann William Scott were hilarious. Jones especially. He was a scientist by day and a women's volleyball coach by night. Interesting career mix he has there! Throughout the movie those 3 made lots of funny jokes. I'm not going to go over the plot because I'm sure you can figure that out for yourself. In a nutshell, if you're looking for a few hours of entertainment give this movie a look.",Evolution

It's full of great-one liners and is guaranteed to make you laugh more than once or twice.The movie is full of great actors who portray their character very well--especially Orlando Jones as the stereo-typical Black guy. And David Duchovny's subtle jokes that he used to be involved with government will make an X-Phile smile. Evolution manages to reference many great, classic Sci-Fi movies, too, which just adds to the laughter.

If you are reading this for an in depth analysis, let's just first observe the themes in this piece of...ehmmm... cinema: (in the order of appearance) 1. a meteor falling into earth...wohooo, catastrophe, fire and brimstone! wait a minute!... not just yet. but there is a guy with a blow-up doll! 2. ahhh... the years of college, or is that high school, whatever, here we have a guy who is giving straight A's and he's even David Duchovny! This bit kinda bothered me because it was sort of unrealistic, but HEY, that's what the entertainment is here for. 3. Ahhh, and finally: The pinnacle of cinema: ""The black guy"" teaming up with the ""The white guy"". Only this time!!!... it's not some muscle kung-foo marine he's fighting with...it's....David Duchowny!!!! Just insert your usual list of clichés in here. 4. What else is left? Toilet humour and inappropriate sexual references? Well you have them!!! And that's the whole beauty of this film. 5. What!? We also have a generic Idiot to tie the whole plot together. No! there are three of them! Brilliant if you ask me! 6. OK, forget the product placement... 7. Yes, it's Independence Day. Just watch closely. I almost missed it myself.I would say in the end this was not bad at all. Chill out kids. It's just fun. But if you're feeling kinda philosophical, put on some... hell I don't know (if forgot if I ws trying to be cynical or serious). I could have been a better parody if that what it was trying to be, or a better I don't know. All in all it has some rather noble humour in it if you know where to look for it.

It was a good comedy.  Not, bust a gut funny, but funny.  The story was cookie-cutter.  Citizen discovers aliens, government takes over, aliens turn bad, citizens try and save the world.My biggest problem was with the characters.  Duchovny, Jones, and Moore all played scientists and they were either clumsy, dim-witted, or anything but smart acting, most of the time.  Jones did show that besides being funny he can be serious.

I can't express how tired I am of using the anus as a comedic device/locale. Julianne Moore should be ashamed of herself for being involved and playing a ""character"" whose single trait is that she's clumsy and falls down a lot. Har, har.  It isn't just that the movie isn't funny.  It's inept.  There are so many jokes that misfire and die that I was squirming with embarrassment and pity for everyone involved.

265,LeeXX,Is it a thriller or a comedy? Answer...neither!,3,24 July 2001,"A very, very disappointing movie.  It seems to be a lightweight sci-fi thriller, but the makers (in their wisdom?) decided to include some silly one liners, some absolutely ridiculous pratfalls from Julianne Moore and some plain stupid plot devices (Head and Shoulders?) in order to class it as a comedy.  This film is neither thrilling nor funny.  From the outset, the tone of the film is uncertain and remains that way all the way through. It's not often I am looking at my watch after 15 minutes of a Reitman movie. Good special effects and music do their best to redeem things. Julianne Moore is wasted in her role and this film suggests that David Duchovny has a long way to go to convince me that he is a potential big screen star.",Evolution

Duchovny is good, though Orlando Jones is much better!Unfortunately towards the end the movie gets more and more stupid.

""Ghostbusters"" flew because of the VERY funny people involved, not necessarily because it was better written - which it was.

I'd say it was a science fiction with its tongue firmly in its cheek.  When the comedy appears it's very funny and silly.  Particularly the ending.I'd compare this movie to Ghostbusters.

Didn't they bother to employ an editor for the script?The lack of continuity was jarring.  Why did the ""biology"" teacher teach his students the periodic chart.  Mmmm how about a ""chemistry"" teacher doing periodic charts??  Did I have to get jerked back from the willing suspension of disbelief to deal with that poor verisimilitude?  And, couldn't they have spent another 12 minutes on writing the plot to make some of the CDC, army, college, or ANY of the situations the tiniest bit realistic.I could go on and on (like the movie).

Not being an X-Files fan at all I had never really seen Duchovny in anything. I had never heard of Orlando Jones but after seeing evolution I think that I will have to keep my eye out for anything he is in. Aykroyd, Scott and Moore add the finishing touches to what has been one of the best casting jobs of all time.The story is preety simple, Aliens come to earth via a meteor and they are able to, in a  matter of hours evolve from small bacteria into walking creatures (Something that has taken humans hundreds of millions of years). So as you can see the story is fairly different to any other sci-fi movie of today and I think that it could probably beat them.What drew me to the movie (besides my friend) was the director Ivan Reitmen. Reitmens previous movies include Ghostbuster, Ghostbusters II, Road Trip and Twins, all of these being in my favorites movie list. And after seeing Evolution I can see that this 55 year old director still holds magnificent power for movie making.Another factor that helped Evolution move along was it's comic genius. All the way through there was humour shown by all characters and not old humour but new and improved humour. Little gags or puns help the movie move along and also keep the audience entangled and enthrawled in the movie.
Overall, Evolution was an excellent comic sci-fi. Everything from the acting, to the directing, to the comedy, to the inventive aliens this movie had it all covered. I congratulate all involved and award EVOLUTION with a perfect *****.",Evolution

Great chemistry between 3 of the 4 main actors (david duchovny, orlando bloom and juliane moore). Sean wiliam scott plays his regular dumb character.
It's a movie about aliens who aren't friendly, but it's not your 'kill-kill-kill' type of movie.

The designs were quite interesting and effective as alien monsters but did they really have to go and screw up some of them with bad CGI? While most of the CGI is passable, the dragons really look fake and unconvincing. The story is the standard sci-fi alien invasion thing but with some really neat ideas and amusing consequences extensively thrown in. But the entire movie itself is very witty and thoroughly enjoyable. I would thus recommend this movie as a must watch at least once, not just to pass the time. Of course, you should'nt expect one of the best movies ever.",Evolution
274,eklauss34,LOL!,9,26 December 2002,I love this movie.  I've seen it a number of times now and the combined talent of David Duchovny and the rest of actors along with a very funny script really shines.  It's an amusingly sarcastic movie that takes full advantage of Duchovny as a straight man (something he showed he's a master of during the X-Files years.) I think the studio really missed the boat on the way this film was marketed and subsequently very few people ever saw it.,Evolution

I remembered seeing ten minutes of it late one night, then recording it because it seemed amusing. It's better than that for a number of reasons. First is Julianne Moore, but that's another story that would simply betray my superficiality. A stronger reason is the daffy but symbiotic relationship that develops among the three main characters. But most important, the writing is crisp and funny, and it made me forget the outlandishness of certain plot points. Right around then David Duchovny was still basking in the X-Files glow, and since then he has been involved in his share of clunkers. But in Evolution he's Mulder again, smart-mouthed and wry and comfortable in surroundings that demand bemused surprise but never denial. Good stuff...and did I mention Julianne Moore?",Evolution

Only noteworthy for taking the American male obsession with the anal region to new heights of desperation, seasoned of course with enough thinly-veiled homophobia to make it acceptable. This, when combined with what may be a genuinely careful attempt to include an interesting sci-fi premise, makes for a film that manages to be bizarre and dire in roughly equal proportions. It may have been my imagination but you can actually see the growing awareness of the actors' plight dawning on them as the movie progresses, as their faces become ever more strained and their delivery becomes increasingly leaden. A blemish on the careers of all those who participated in it.",Evolution

Duchovny is not mulder, but he is. Plot doesn't matter. Creature movies are good. Scifi movies, where the scary thing is an oversimplification of one reasonably interesting scientific concept, are good. What if the monster kept evolving? Became a microcosm of evolutionary process. That movie needed to be made. It probably already had been.Is it a comedy? Well, yes. It is comedic. But it's like some characters are in a different movie than others. Like a slapstick and a procedural, side by side. Uneasy balance. The mood shifts.Essentially a demo reel for what range of bio monsters you could make with CGI in the early aughts.

280,filmluvr-3,Choke-on-the-popcorn funny!,10,12 June 2001,"Ivan Reitman has made a new classic sci-fi comedy, but that isn't a huge surprise coming from the man who helmed Ghostbusters.  The movie is absolutely hilarious; I laughed harder in Evolution than I had in years. Some of the gags are somewhat overused, such as Julianne Moore's CDC scientist's clumsiness, but the rest of the movie easily overshadows these blemishes.In his first few scenes, Scott's acting seems absolutely awful, but that quickly disappears (and I have no explanation for it whatsoever). Unfortunately I think he is working towards the typecast of young, doofus goofball.  Hopefully he can get around that in the future.David Duchovny gives a very refreshing performance, breaking out of his usually dapper moods as Fox Mulder.  One line about government officials seems to draw from the audience's knowledge of Duchovny's ""other"" role, and received an even bigger laugh for it.Orlando Jones also shines in this movie.  He has come a long way from his days on Mad TV, and has a bright future ahead of him.  Perhaps he will be the next Chris Rock (or Chris Tucker).All-in-all, this is a fantastic movie.  The overused gags and inexplicable temporary acting deficiencies of Mr. Scott pull this movie down to a 9-out-of-10 stars.",Evolution
281,Fincher-3,"""Buggy"" Fun",7,12 June 2001,"When I first read about Evolution, the latest sci-fi scheme to come from DreamWorks, I was interested.  A story about aliens with humor, not bad. Then when I read that Ivan Reitman, the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm, I was thrilled.  I mean, come on, after he was given duds like `Father's Day' and `Six Days, Seven Nights' to work with, isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while (I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of `Junior'oh, I just did)?It begins with the introduction of Scott's character, Wayne Green, a wannabe fireman practicing for his fireman final (questionable at first, hilarious in the end).  Then he gets an unexpected visitor - a meteor, carrying alien organisms hits the heart of the Arizona desert. After a community college science professor, Ira Kane Duchovny, working with one screwed up screen name)and his eccentric geologist buddy, Harry Block (Jones) discover the meteor, they find that the `bleeding' rock starts to create these weird alien creatures and soon they begin to multiply.  Kane's nemeses, Gen. Woodman (Levine) and the military get involved, things get too out-of-control, so it's up to the teaming of Kane, Block, Green and government scientist Allison Reed (Moore) to stop the evolution.If you're a Reitman fan, the plot of this could make you go in expecting some kind of tribute to both `Ghostbusters'.  In a way it is, and is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  If you liked, or even loved (like me) `Ghostbusters', I can bet my clean pair of boxers that you'll get a hoot out of `Evolution'. But of course any film must maintain some distance from the films its being compared too, and `Evolution' does that.  The characters and situations are different, atmospherically.  Duchovny turns in a `cool' performance, by that meaning he wasn't Mr. Badass or Mr. Laugh-a-Minute, he was just, well, Duchovny and that itself is always pleasing to watch.  Jones is his usual funny self, delivering some funny lines. Moore's ability to do just about anything comes in handy here, playing the hottie-yet-clumsy love interest. Scott's acting resembles the other roles he's done in the past, and I've come to appreciate that (that thing he does w/ his eyebrow is getting funnier every time).  Can't say the same for Levine; his cliché performance as the bad-guy-who-doesn't-listen character gets annoying fast.A lot of the film makes me question what it is, and really what it could have been.  The script, penned by three writers, was originally written as a sci-fi THRILLER, not a sci-fi comedy.  There were a lot of laughs, but because of the script's origin, there could have been more.  But considering the script was originally a sci-fi thriller, the filmmakers, including Reitman, did a great job.  Can't say much for the ending, though: the ending looks and feels like a meshed-up result of what-could-have-been, and from that mushiness, the filmmakers poked at and took at least some of the good elements.  Thank god the film is a comedy; if it was its original idea, the ending would have been disastrous.`Evolution' is a overall crowd-pleaser with nice special effects and makeup (those dead aliens looked great).  It's a few laughs and comedic situations short of comedic greatness, but look on the bright side-Reitman is back in his lovable kick-ass form.  He's tapped into the present and how most comedies are made, but he didn't dare forget his roots: there is a sequence in the film where Duchovny, Jones and Scott chase down a flying creature in a mall.  The three, equipped with shotguns, dispose of it in true Ghostbusters style.  And with me being a big Ghostbusters fan, I fell in love with the it, plus its the best scene in the film.

Ivan Reitman directed it, who directed the great ""Ghostbusters"" movies. However, I was very disappointed with the film. They jump right into the action, not even letting there be the least bit of believability to it. There was no setup. What there was an idiot in the desert practising for firefighter school and an asteroid hitting his car. "" It's burnt up, dude."" David Duchovney is NOT funny whatsoever in this film. He's way too boring and one dimensional for this kind of role. Orlando Jones did have some funny scenes, and was the star. That guy from ""Dude Where's My Car"" was absolutley terrible. He had pathetic one-liners that left the crowd silent, acted TERRIBLY, and made me want to vomit. He's no comedian. Then there was poor Dan Aykroyd. What happened to his career? He was the governor of Arizona, and didn't do too great of a job. He's so out of shape now, it's just sad. Don't get me wrong, I absolutly loved him in ""Ghostbusters,"" but he just can't get a good part anymore.I'm sure you can see, I was terribly disappointed. I'd like to say something positive, but I laughed only once or twice thanks to Orlando Jones. I didn't think he had it in him. In a little theater in South Carolina it was $6. In the big cities, I'm sure it is considerably more. So, just wait till it comes to your local video store. You don't want to waste your hard-earned money on this bomb-shell.",Evolution

David Duchovny did surprisingly excellent comedic performance (I liked the quote that seemed to target the X Files something that yes the government hide everything or something like that) and also was supported by great Orlando Jones (his quotes on the Nobel prize were superb) and Sean William Scott. The last I don't know 20 minutes when the movie changed was a fresh way to end such a movie that isn't and doesn't want to be serious sci-fi nor a typical action movie.

I was worried that Orlando Jones was just going to reheat and dish out his 7-Up ads character, that David Duchovny was going to laff it up with inside jokes about X-Files (""I know these government guys""), and that it just wasn't going to be funny.  I was surprised on both counts:  Jones turned out really quite a good performance, hitting high points with comic lines and still pulling off the relatively serious mien of his college professor role believably.  Duchovny, on the other hand, phoned it in.  He seems to have forgotten the difference between acting deadpan, and acting at all. I swear the only time his face moved was when they were singing along to ""Play That Funky Music"" in Jones' character's jeep -- and then, it was only his lips.I'm not a really picky movie viewer.  My one criteria for ""good movie"" is that I don't mentally heckle it until after the credits start rolling.  If it entertains me for the entire time it's on, it was a good film.

By the end, I was amusing myself by looking for continuity errors and other gaffes -- and I'm not even the type of person who usually catches that sort of thing.  I mean, a character can be wearing a different colored shirt from one minute to the next and I won't notice until someone else points it out.  So if I notice that in one scene Duchovny's dripping with shampoo from head to toe and in the next when he's locking lips with Moore he's got a few token drips over the hair but hardly any on his face, it's either a big error or I'm *really* bored.The last thing that detracted from the story was the toilet humor.  Big alien farts and sphincters just aren't that funny to me.  One or two can keep the movie lively.  The grand denouement though, --.  There are probably dozens of 13 year-olds who thought it was the funniest thing ever, but as for me, I thought it was tacky and tasteless.  (I also hated ""Kingpin"" and ""Dumb and Dumber,"" if that gives you an idea of what I think is tasteless.)In terms of content, ""Evolution"" had an okay premise.  ""'Ghostbusters' meets 'Men in Black'"" it was not, but it could've stood on its own with a little more work.  Alien meteorite falls to earth, bringing with it its own creepy-crawlies.  The effects were quite good, I thought -- the little blue ""dog"" alien was so cute that I could hardly blame the Avon lady for trying to pet him (although you know that it was going to lead to no good), the dead flying aliens were realistic, and the insect-like ones were downright neat.  The score was well-done and fitting.I went in expecting to exit the theatre wishing I could retrieve the previous two hours of my life.  I actually came out with a more favorable opinion than I would have thought.  Whether that's a good thing or not is anyone's guess. :)",Evolution

With the enamorous success of ""Double Take"" and ""Say it Aint so"", Orlando Jones is by far becoming the next Dan Aykroyd......who is in this movie and who's role in this movie can only be described as ""unnecessary"". Duchovny and Moore play far inferior to what they are capable of doing, and Seann William Scott is only in this movie to get the younger generation to come to this.....thinking he might do his Steve Stifler routines, I guess....All those who have seen this movie are now dumber for having done so.

Fortunately it seems that he is smart enough for doing this kind of jobs, making some fun of his own character in the Fox series.The movie starts with a very deep idea: an extraterrestrial life form comes to earth and starts a light-speed evolution from the simplest cell structures to the most complex and self-conscious animals. This ""invasion"" menaces to extinct us and any other life form currently living on earth in no more than a couple of months.Duchovny and Jones are really funny in their characters, but Moore is clearly over-acting, trying to be funny and she, simply, looks stupid. Dan Aykroid is great in his supporting role as Governor Lewis, as well as Ted Levine as ""evil"" General Russel.CGI/FX are not something to open the mouth but they're better than other things I've seen around and the producers have put money enough to make some complex scenes, like that in the mall, pursuing the flying monster.It's not a deep movie about life, but a regular blockbuster product, that makes full service for spending Saturday evening on the coach.

All of these concepts are developed to a basic level, and basically left that way through the rest of the film. The script itself was fairly unremarkable, as was the acting.However, as is frequently the case with these films, a lot of basic mistakes can be forgiven for the special effects which, while not exactly groundbreaking, certainly lift the movie at various points. Some of the comedy (when it steered away from the obvious dick and fart gags) was quite good, although not really rolling in the aisles stuff.This is a film you can put on and veg to - I don't think it has anything which will keep you glued to the screen, but it's semi-decent light hearted fodder if you're bored on a Sunday.

But rather than ensuing hi-jinx, Evolution is hi-junk.
David Duchnovy plays the 'Bill Murray wacky scientist' character with alarming comedic indifference. His sidekick, Orlando Jones, is sort of Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson, and Dan Ayckroyd rolled into one annoying character. Ayckroyd himself even makes a cameo, just to remind us we're watching 'Ghostbusters,' only without the laughs, story, characters, script, or direction.Julianne Moore and Seann William Scott round out one of the most wasted groups of talent in recent film memory.

Basic premise of the movie without giving anything away is, Duchovny, Jones, Scott and Moore are fighting off an alien invasion that grows twice in size every time it evolves, if they fail. The aliens will eventually destroy all life on earth. Its a sci-fi comedy. With some surprisingly good chemistry. Jones plays off Duchovny's straight-man so well. And they both play the straight man off of Scott's wild card routine, and speaking of him, this is one of Sean-William Scott's better roles, he's not to over the top, all tho there is this one scene. But I highly recommend it. I give it an A- (94%)",Evolution

336,paranoid-android,Laugh Riot (Minor Spoilers),9,8 June 2001,"This movie is a gut-busting laugh riot. No, it's not terribly original; plot elements were lifted right out of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2. And yes, it's mostly predictable. But that doesn't detract from its enjoyability whatsoever.Yeah, it's Ghostbusters all over again, only with computer-generated aliens instead of ghosts as the baddies this time. But this is a well-acted and funny update to Reitman's classic, not a tired rehash.(Minor plot spoilers ahead, nothing big)Duchovny and Jones play a pair of community college professors who discover an alien meteorite with strange properties. Scott plays the aspiring fireman who was actually on the scene when the meteor hit; Moore plays the CDC official who arrives on the scene when the military takes over the crash site. The two scientists are ousted from the site, and break in to attempt to regain credit for their discovery. Hilarity ensues.Duchovny and Jones are a wonderful comic pair, Jones's wacky brand of humor blending well with Duchovny's deadpan delivery. It was odd (but refreshing) seeing Moore in a comedic role; overall she does quite well but comes off as a little flat at times. Scott appropriately ""Stifler""-izes his role, which is getting a little repetitive, but still manages to be funny here.The special effects augment the movie without getting in the way too much. Don't go into the theater without expecting to be grossed out several times.Funny movie, best I've seen in a long time. Hopefully Duchovny will find more roles like this. (9/10)",Evolution
337,roglewis,"a cookie cutter movie, except the cookies taste awful",1,12 June 2001,"what a complete waste of money. it sucked. dont see it. as much as you may be tempted by the previews: DO NOT SEE IT. many people walked out. the only reason i didnt was the air conditioning. by the end, i regretted that decision.you might think well the special effects will be cool. but they're only in 5% of the movie, so be prepared to talk long and frequent trips to the bathroom to avoid all the useless dialogue and poor character development.then you might think, well at least there will be a big fancy ending. and there was. but it sucks. it sucks a lot. I almost walked out during the ending scene, but i didn't want to give up so close to the finish. although the couple in front of me didn't feel the same and left about 10 minutes before the end.  I'd say the theater was 50% as full at the end as at the beginning.it was a cookie cutter movie, except the cookies were moose-p*** flavored with chunks of human feces.  the actors were extraordinarily underused, the story was shoddy, the caricatured army dufus's were way too over-done. and the science was from ass-land.there was actually a moment when Duchovny's character blatently said: ""Hey, look at that one"" and the camera focused for a money shot of a CG bug crawling around. there was no further mention to the bug, it was simply eye-candy/movie-filler.  too bad after all those filler's it was still an empty movie.the only shining moments were whenever Dan Akroyd's character came on-screen. which didn't happen until halfway through and he's on for less time than the special effects, which already weren't worth it.  I'd recommend renting ""Ghostbusters"" (the original gem which inspired this fugesee): it's a far better film, and you'll have enough money to rent ""Ghostbusters II"" the next night.  and you can watch Dan Akroyd throughout the whole film.",Evolution

341,jjsharshaw,"Good, um, Clean - and Shiny - Fun!",9,28 June 2006,"I have had this DVD for a couple of years and have watched it a lot. Picked it up in the bargain bin at Walmart for half the price or better of a single matinée ticket. But until tonight, I never noticed the soundtrack. Wow! Patty Larkin and her song ""Anyway the Main Thing Is"" was hypnotic and hearing Wild Cherry and their ""Play That Funky Music White Boy,"" was a nice, upbeat guy moment. I'm not usually a credits watcher but a lot of the tunes were replayed over the end. Well worth letting them roll with your eyes closed and the volume up.David Duchovny: Funny. Better than in ""Playing God."" A little inside joking about his ""X-Files"" day's. He looked like he was having fun - as did all the rest of the cast.Julianne Moore, I think plays somewhat against type. I haven't seen that much of her work but what I have seen has been of a more dramatic nature. She was wryly funny and it's fun to see a serious actress just do some bits and have some fun. (Are we detecting a trend here? Fun?)Wayne the Fireman-wanna be. He is an archetype - everyone at one time or another has known Wayne. Everyone has known the blustery, clueless police lieutenant and the witless, large, 'clean and shiny' brothers and Ted Levine as General Woodman, the military bad guy archetype. I've seen some complaints about Levine's performance as simply playing the stereotyped bad guy, but just as he is for Detective Adrian Monk, he was an admirable foil/straight man for Duchovny. I can't really think of who would have been a better General Woodman to Duchovny's Ira Kane.As for the Governor - it was nice to see an older Dan Akroyd do his schtick. His performance was less intense than his ""Bassomatic"" bit but I think Dan nailed the good old boy, get-to-the-point, smooth-but-bossy politician, as only Akroyd could do it (and minus any hint of a Chicago-land accent).And finally, the lamented (in some few comments) performance of Olando Jones: Orlando is Orlando. Orlando playing against type...I can't even imagine that in this movie. This was not the vehicle for Orlando to make a run for an Oscar. I thought, in a sense, he and Duchovny took turns playing straight man for the other and THAT was fun to see. ""Seven Up Yours,"" Orlando. You make me laugh.It is simply a nice, escapist bit o'FUN for an evening when the World seems to be tearing at its guts and I really don't want to have to think about anything other than Ivan Reitman's players in the Arizona dessert, battling something out of this world. Call me irresponsible. I had been plugged into NPR for most of the day. I think sitting down with my 9 year old son and having some good laughs was like taking a shower from the grit and grime of the World's problems. I'll get back to the World's issues tomorrow and that, my friends, will have to be soon enough.So have a nice, thoughtless bunch of laughs; have fun and escape the troubles of this world for 90 minutes, give or take.",Evolution

343,whoisdonovan,"It's No ""Men In Black""",6,31 May 2001,"Having seen a sneak preview of ""Evolution,"" I can guarantee that the comparisons with ""Men In Black"" are going to be non-stop. It's a science-fiction/action-adventure/comedy flick about an alien invasion, starring a white guy and a black guy. However, sad to say, it doesn't quite live up to its genre predecessor. Some of the plot seems contrived at best and downright baffling at worst, as though several important scenes had been left on the cutting-room floor (due to resurface, no doubt, on the DVD). But with that out of the way, ""Evolution"" is pretty good. None of the acting is bad, and the script delivers a few genuine side-splitters. The best part of the movie by far, though, is the creature design-- if they release an art or making-of book, I'll snap it up in a second. All in all, it's not the best film ever made, or even the best of its kind, but it's worth watching on the big screen. Six stars.",Evolution

The high point: Good casting...but what are they to do with a dead script, aimless direction and an idea that should've been scrapped prior to shooting? The jokes are lifeless. Five minutes into the film, you're hit with this really awful sense of ""didn't we see this done better before?"" feeling. You're not alone.It's not even so bad that it's funny, as in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or other mishaps that make it to the cinema, no, this work is just plain _awful_...and nothing can improve it, unless you use the DVD as a coaster afterwards.Leave this one alone, really.",Evolution

It wasn't the best acted, but it was fun to watch. The plot is stupid, the aliens are cheesy, and there are plot holes that you could drive a fire engine through (see the movie for why I chose that metaphor). But, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and therefore if you watch it just for the fun of it, you won't be disappointed. David Duchovny is hilarious, poking fun at his character from the ""X-Files,"" Fox Mulder, and Seann William Scott is what you would expect, although I thought casting him in the ""American Pie"" movies was more appropriate. Otherwise, the actors were listless (Julianne Moore), or cliché (Orlando Jones). But it was worth seeing, and I admit I laughed. I wouldn't consider this classic cinema, but if you have nothing to do one rainy afternoon, go see this funny and enjoyable movie.",Evolution

It has nearly 400 user reviews but no message thread? The reason why I'm looking to add an entry to a message thread in the first place is because I'm surprised that this kind of movie only has 12 trivial items.

With films like men in black that take a little more serious note to 'alien invasion' this film is pure laughs. It would be interesting to see this film with better graphics and a better script! The scenes with the court are at most a 2/10 just because it doesn't add much depth to the storyline or characters. The actors deserve all the credit here. They did the best they could with the script. The ending was completely rushed whilst the beginning of the film was filled with suspense and mystery.
