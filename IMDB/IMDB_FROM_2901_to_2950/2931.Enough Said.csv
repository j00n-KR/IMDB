0,SnoopyStyle,Great all around performance from Julia Louis-Dreyfus,8,10 August 2014,Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a divorced mom and masseuse. She doesn't date and facing an empty nest with her daughter Ellen (Tracey Fairaway) about to go to Sarah Lawrence. She's dragged to a party by her married friends Sarah (Toni Collette) and Will (Ben Falcone). There she meets the fascinating poet Marianne (Catherine Keener) becoming her best friend and masseuse. She also meets chubby divorcée Albert (James Gandolfini) who has an obnoxious girl Tess (Eve Hewson) about to study at Parsons. Meanwhile Ellen's friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson) keeps hanging around taking Eva as a surrogate mother angering Ellen.It's one of the last movies of James Gandolfini and he does a nice job as a likable slob without being a pushover. He's a sweet guy doing a sweet character. The big revelation for me is Julia Louis-Dreyfus. She does a great job not only in the comedic parts but is even more stellar in the dramatic parts. It's probably the first all around role I've seen from her and she knocks it out of the park. The characters from Nicole Holofcener are endearing. The actors do a great job giving it humor.,Enough Said
1,Horst_In_Translation,One of 2013's best romance movies,8,5 January 2014,"""Enough said"" is Nicole Holfcener's newest work and as with her earlier films, she did not only direct it, but was also involved with the writing, here even completely on her own. Her earlier works usually center on female characters during somehow significant periods of their lives and this one is no different. The main character is played convincingly by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for her turn here. Dreyfus has won Emmys in the last two years for her very different work in the TV series Veep and it seems like almost every TV project she touches becomes successful. It's big screen of course, but the same can be said for ""Enough Said"" and this also has a lot to do with the far-too-early deceased James Gandolfini, who plays her love interest here. I think I even slightly preferred his performance to hers, his cute clumsiness of a man in his 50s falling in love was just sugar-sweet and played a huge role for me why I enjoyed this film so much. I wouldn't say the real drama parts (especially the whole part of hurting him by talking about him to his ex-wife) were bad, but the real heart and soul of the film are the romance and, to a slightly smaller degree, the comedy.The story can be summarized pretty quickly. The main character meets a new guy and a new female friend randomly at the same time and quickly realizes how the two were married not too long ago. She hears pretty negative stories about him from the ex-wife to nobody's surprise,but has a wonderful time with him that, by no means, matches the stories. When she realized the connection by seeing their daughter with both of them, she starts occasionally asking the ex-wife about her ex-husband to find things out about her new love interest. Of course the whole plot is a huge coincidence, but if you manage not to think about that too much, it's a very enjoyable one-and-a-half hours.So I'd also like to talk a bit about Gandolfini here. It's so sad he's gone now (and I haven't even seen his magnum opus ""The Sopranos"") and this is his last (or maybe penultimate) movie. He's deserving of all the accolade he's getting and I'm glad to see him in contention for a posthumous Oscar nomination after getting the recognition from his SAG peers. I'm not sure if I would agree with their decision to consider his performance supporting. It's definitely close to a co-lead I'd say, but whatever they choose, I'd be happy if he gets the recognition by the Academy as well. The interactions between his character and Louis-Dreyfus' are are among the year's best in cuteness, warmth and authenticity and their first kiss scene was maybe the sweetest romance moment I've seen all year. The whole audience during my screening was like oooooooh and aaaaah when they liplocked like two clumsy teenagers.There's some comic relief with the lead character bonding so much with her daughter's best friend and you could certainly find some drama in there as well when the real daughter comes into play. This ""proxy daughter"" part was an interesting storyline and worthy addition to the script for sure. It was truly hilarious when the best friend of her daughter enters the bedroom and runs into JLD and Gandolfini's characters and they have breakfast afterward like a real family. ""Enough Said"" is very much worth watching, especially for couples all ages and it also teaches a great lesson on how truly liking someone is much more powerful than all the flaws or imperfections that special someone may have.",Enough Said
2,Prismark10,A fine romance,5,4 January 2015,"Enough Said is a naturalistic, bittersweet romantic comedy drama about two middle aged divorced people who start a relationship. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is Eva a divorcée with daughter just about to go to college.She meets Albert played by James Gandolfini in a party who also has a daughter who is about to go to college. They begin a relationship in a nervous manner but they get on well together.The complication is that Eva is a masseur and one of her client is Albert's ex-wife played by Christine Keener and she always complains about her ex-husband. Eva soon realises that its Albert who she is talking about and instead of keeping her distance is intrigued to hear more about her complaints. The problem is that subconsciously she later carries that negative attitude herself when she is with Albert and he picks up on the negative vibes.This is an easy going film. It will mainly appeal to an older audience, there is a lot of talking, little by way of action and it does feel like that these are natural people interacting with each other. It is a slight film but kudos to the actors for taking a risk with this independent project.",Enough Said
3,kosmasp,True,10,14 June 2014,"James Gandolfini has made so many great characters and shows or movies that it is hard to think he won't be able to make more. Going out with a movie like this though (and with a title like that), is beyond words. While he is not the main character, Julias character is, he is as enticing as ever.Enough said indeed, because as someone else already stated, this might be one of the (if not THE) most adult romantic comedy. And by adult I mean a state of mind. And by comedy, I don't mean laugh out loud, slap you knee kind of comedy. No, this is subtle. And while there are a few coincidences (and a rate of predictability), this still is awesome. With an ending that could not have been better. And characters that are rich and more than nicely defined. I cannot recommend this more",Enough Said
4,jboothmillard,Enough Said,7,18 January 2021,"I heard about this film because it was one of the last performances of the star of The Sopranos. I'd missed it on TV a couple of times, I'm glad I got to watch it. Basically, in Los Angeles, Eva (Golden Globe nominated Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a massage therapist and the divorced mother of her teenage daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway). She has a pretty uneventful life, with annoying clients, including chatterbox Cynthia (Jessica St. Clair) and Martin (Lennie Loftin) who has bad breath. She has been single for a long time since her divorce is dreading her daughter's upcoming departure for college. One night, she attends a party in Pacific Palisades with her friends, married couple Sarah (Toni Collette) and Will (Ben Falcone). There Eva meets fellow divorcee, Marianne (Catherine Keener) a poet, they get on very well and she hires Eva to be her masseuse. During the party, Eva also meets divorced father, Albert (James Gandolfini), a large man who also has his daughter leaving to go back to school back east in the fall. During their conversation, Eva and Albert both state that there are no attractive people at the party, including each other, indirectly. Despite this, Eva is told Albert has asked for her number, and she agrees to go to dinner with him. She learns that Albert works for the American library of cultural history television library, their date goes well, and Eva looks forward to another. Meanwhile, Marianne contacts Eva for a massage, and after taking an immediate liking to one another they become friends. During their sessions together, Marianne mentions her husband and why their relationship did not work out and led to their divorce. Eva and Albert go on their second date, and they end having sex; she later tells Sarah he was great in bed. Eva later goes to Marianne to give another massage, and learns indirectly that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband, recognising his daughter Tess (Eve Hewson). Eva tells Sarah about her quandary. Despite the situation, Eva decides to continue seeing Albert, but she cannot notice some bad habits mentioned by his ex-wife. Eva later goes to dinner with Ellen and her best friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson), Sarah and Will, Eva's ex-husband Peter (Toby Huss) and his new partner. Following the meal, Eva asks Peter about their divorce. After another massage, Eva encourages Marianne to voice her complaints about Albert so she can identify potential problems in her relationship with him. She mentions many things, including his eating habits, having no night table, and throwing things on the floor. Later, Eva asks Sarah if they can do a double date, and they attend a dinner party. But Eva cannot help but point out his bad habits, including some she noticed herself, e.g. not whispering, and picking on his size and weight. Awkwardly, this picking causes Sarah's housemaid Kathy (Anjelah Johnson) to be offended and threaten quitting for Sarah thinking she put something in the wrong place when it was Eva. Finally, at another appointment with Marianne, Albert comes to the house with Tess, Eva's relationship with him is finally exposed with Tess's confirmation. Eva tries to explain that she happened to meet them both at the same party and did not know they were formerly married until it was too late. Albert and Marianne realise that she did not tell either of them when she could have, and Eva leaves in embarrassment. Albert angry at Eva break up with her and refuses to return her calls. Meanwhile, Ellen's friend Chloe has been asking Eva for advice about her boyfriend, and Eva tells her that if she wants to have sex with him, she should. Chloe's mother finds out about this and confronts Eva, and she is further humiliated. Eva and Peter later take Ellen to the airport for her flight to college, and after she leaves, they hug on good terms. A few months later, on Thanksgiving Day, Eva drives by Albert's home and stops in front of the house on her way to pick up Ellen from the airport. He is surprised to see him come outside and she parks the car. They sit on the porch together and say only a few words. Albert tells her he has a night table now, and Eva laughs realising he is joking, and they begin to renew their relationship. Also starring Michaela Watkins as Hilary, Phillip Brock as Jason, and Amy Landecker as Debbie. Louis-Dreyfus is likeable as the woman stuck between keeping her friendship and her newfound relationship, Gandolfini escapes his usual criminal character-type as the overweight slobbish charmer, and there is good support from Keener and Collette. It works as a sweet love story between middle-aged characters, the sticky situation shows that the path to true love is never smooth, it has a well-crafted script, with a good balance of light laughs, getting dramatic when it needs to, it a most watchable romantic comedy-drama. Very good!",Enough Said
5,moonspinner55,Middle-aged contrivances,5,8 June 2014,"There's an ugly undercurrent to this otherwise low-keyed, well-meaning movie from writer-director Nicole Holofcener: a woman makes a mistake, owns up to it (though not at first) but is turned away, unforgiven. Once characters behave in such a way, it's tough to see them in the same light as before, which Holofcener certainly hopes we will do by the finish. The film, about the dating-to-romance course between two tentative, divorced middle-agers (he a television program archivist, she a massage therapist), is charming until Holofcener falls back on the dreaded ""story hook"". Granted, this arc is something that probably helped sell the picture in pitch meetings, but it's manufactured drama aimed at the mass market. James Gandolfini, in his penultimate film performance, is lovely and unmannered, cajoling and sweet-tempered; he makes the film worth-seeing. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is put in the unfortunate position of picking at him (and his weight, which makes her seem like a spoiled sport). Louis-Dreyfuss has a raucous laugh and a bright smile, but too often she's pinched in a 'natural' way, and her relationships with the other characters are fuzzy. The movie would certainly appear to have a big heart, but there's too much dissatisfaction clouding this scenario. It leaves behind distressed feelings and a bad aftertaste. ** from ****",Enough Said
6,tavm,Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini make a nice romantic couple in Enough Said,8,9 March 2014,"Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. Now, I've been a fan of Julia Louis-Dreyfus since the '80s when she was on ""Saturday Night Live"" when that show was a little less memorable than when the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players were on and Eddie Murphy was the only one to truly break out at that time. She did some funny stuff there and then was truly hilarious on ""Seinfeld"" and ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"". Here, she's occasionally funny but also a bit heartbreaking when you see what she's going through here. And James Gandolfini and Catherine Keener also are good in their roles. I really don't feel like recounting what the movie's about, just that I liked the way the relationships between various family members and friends were depicted as realistically as possible. So on that note, I recommend Enough Said.",Enough Said
7,edwagreen,Enough Said Already ***,7,16 July 2014,"Talk about putting your foot in your mouth. Julia discovers that the woman she is giving massages to and has befriended is none other than the former wife of the man she is currently dating. Julia allows her to continue denouncing her first husband, James Gandolfini, without saying a word.You can just imagine the hurt that James feels when he finds out. Both have discovered many similarities in their respective lives. James has quite a snotty daughter and there is a lot to be said about second marriages,especially when the couple meets with her first husband and his wife.Gandolfini is effective here since he is so collective, but forceful when he is forced to.",Enough Said
8,writers_reign,Say No More,8,6 November 2013,"Reading some of the comments posted here it seems I may be the only person in the world who has seen neither The Sopranos nor Seinfeld; I have no prejudice against either show I just don't watch a lot of TV, and that possibly enabled me to watch the two leads - neither of whom I have seen in anything at all - with fresh eyes. I found them both excellent actors and - at least in these roles - warm and likable, which is, I'm assuming, what the director asked of them and given the quality of their acting I feel pretty certain they could play darker if called upon to do so. i was bemused by one comment because the writer complained of too many sub- plots; I find the reverse to be the case with modern movies which tend to lay out a simple A to B line and hew to it. I'm guessing the person who complained has never seen a movie like Casablanca or Mildred Pierce (to pick two at random) which are both rich in sub-plots and all the better for it. As for this I thoroughly enjoyed it and will make a point of checking out other titles by Nicole Holefcener.",Enough Said
9,george.schmidt,Excellent romcom with top of their game acting by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini (in his penultimate role),9,18 September 2013,"ENOUGH SAID (2013) ***1/2 Julia Louis-Dreyfus, James Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Toni Collette, Ben Falcone, Tracey Fairaway, Tavi Gevinson, Eve Hewson, Toby Huss, Amy Landecker, Kathleen Rose Perkins. Excellent romcom with top of their game acting by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini (in his penultimate role) as a pair of mismatched divorcees attempting a relationship that is complicated by the fact that his ex (Keener) is her masseuse client leading to a comedy of errors and a lot of emotional juggling. Funny, real and spot-on dialogue highlight a great screenplay by Nicole Holofcener allowing her leads to sparkle and display some subtle nuanced charms. A winner.",Enough Said
10,evanston_dad,Nicole Holofcener Must Only Know Terribly Unlikable Women,7,19 February 2014,"Julia Louis-Dreyfus proves herself up to the challenge of carrying a feature-length film in Nicole Holofcener's latest, ""Enough Said."" In the film's sitcom premise, she plays a divorced woman who begins dating a man (James Gandolfini), only to find out that he's the ex-husband of one of her new massage clients (Catherine Keener). The problem is that her client's divorce was toxic, and Keener does nothing but point out all of Gandolfini's flaws, which inevitably poison Louis-Dreyfus's opinions of him.Not only does the film have a sitcom premise, it also plays out like one, albeit a smarter-than-average one, complete with happy ending for the new couple. But Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini have a ton of chemistry (who would have thought?) and both have such good comic timing that they're able to elevate the film into something it might not otherwise have been.I don't know who Holofcener hangs out with in her personal life, but based on the movies she makes and the characters in them, they must all be shrewish, brittle, bitter women who are either divorced or in dismal marriages. Yes Louis-Dreyfus's character ends up redeeming herself by the film's end, but oh how unlikable she and all of the other women in the film have to be before we get there.Grade: B",Enough Said
11,ferguson-6,Separating and Connecting,7,29 September 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. A Rom-Com for the 50-ish crowd is pretty darn rare. But then, writer/director Nicole Holofcener doesn't deliver the typical rom-com filled with lame punchlines and perfectly chiseled actors. Instead, James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss come across as real people with the expected defense mode and vulnerabilities as they try to find intimacy and a personal connection.Albert (Gandolfini) and Eva (Louis-Dreyfuss) meet at a party and subtle sparks fly as both claim they aren't attracted to anyone at the party. While at the party, Eva, a massage therapist, also meets Marianne (Catherine Keener), a charming poet who wants to hire Eva to help ease her shoulder pain. Albert and Eva begin dating, and Eva slowly comes around on Albert's grounded and funny personality. Sure he's a bit overweight and somewhat slobby, but he treats her well and adores her. Meanwhile, Eva's massage work on Marianne expose her to Marianne's incessant complaining about her overweight and somewhat slobby ex-husband. Yep. This causes quite the dilemma for Eva because she likes Albert and she envies Marianne's cool lifestyle. Oh and both Eva and Albert have teenage daughters getting ready to go off to college, so the couple also share parent-child separation anxiety.The story clearly centers around Eva, and it's nice to see Louis-Dreyfuss back down a little and avoid some of her sitcom standard moves. We are able to relate to Eva and though we see the corner she is backing herself in to, we also understand how a little bit of poor judgment can spin out of control. Although this is Eva's story, the real heart of the film is delivered by Gandolfini's performance. This is no Tony Soprano ... this is a real guy ... a nice guy ... yes, even a sweet guy.Ms. Holofcener has set her precedent with snippy banter from intelligent characters with her previous films Please Give (2010) and Friends With Money (2006), the former I liked very much and the latter I cared little for. This time, all of her characters and their dialogue ring true and are relatable. Eva's married friends are played by Toni Collette and Ben Falcone (married in real life to Melissa McCarthy) and they have the only hollow sub-plot with their should we or should we not fire the maid dilemma. The two teenage daughters are played by Tracey Fairaway and Eve Hewson (Bono's daughter) and both have scenes that really strike a chord and ring true.Mr. Gandolfini passed away earlier this year and there was the thought that this would be his final released film. However, it's been decided that Animal Rescue will be finalized and released in 2014. It's difficult to watch him and not think what could have been over the next few years, though his legacy is quite secure. His range was much greater than many give him credit for, and I would recommend watching him in both True Romance (1993) and Welcome to the Rileys (2010).",Enough Said
12,gradyharp,'What about us? What about protecting us?',8,24 January 2014,"About writer/director Nicole Holofcener, with 'Friends with Money', 'Lovely & Amazing', 'Please Give' in films and contributions to television series 'Parks and Recreation', 'Sox Feet Under', 'Sex and the City' – enough said. The girl's got talent and a voice of her own that happens to resound very significantly in the middle age generation. ENOUGH SAID is a quiet, gentle, sweet, and disarming little film that is so well written it feels like being a voyeur over the back fence.Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a divorced and single parent of a teenage girl, spends her days enjoying work as a masseuse while dreading her daughter's impending departure for college. Her friend Sarah (Toni Collette) insists she go out to clubs to associate with people other than her massage clients. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) - a sweet, funny and like-minded man who is also divorced and facing the departure of his daughter to college. The two rather nonchalantly enter a romance and Eva gains a new client – famous poet Marianne (Catherine Keener) who unloads her disappointment with the slob she had been stuck with and allows Eva, during sessions, to do likewise. It slowly becomes evident (through the interaction of Eva's and Albert's daughters as well as the complaints of Marianne), that Marianne's slob of an ex is actually Albert. Now enlightened and with a skewed view of her ability to read other people as well as her own misconceptions of what she wants in a partner pries a schism between Eva and Albert – and very wisely on Holofcener's script we are left wonder how things will end or develop.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is brilliant as is James Gandolfini whose interaction is spot-on as far as contemporary relationships are concerned. But the rest of the cast is not far behind – with Keener as radiant as ever and Colette as fine a comic foil as can be found. Not a great movie, but a very moving one!",Enough Said
13,zetes,Not up to Nicole Holofcener's standard,6,19 January 2014,"Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini waste their charm on this mediocre romantic comedy. Shame on Holofcener. She can do so much better. I could use the cliché ""sitcom"" criticism, but Holofcener has directed several episodes of Parks and Recreation, and that sitcom is far more complex than this film is. No, despite the more mature ages of its characters, this could just as easily have been a Katherine Heigl vehicle or something. Louis-Dreyfus plays a recently divorced masseuse who makes a new friend (Catherine Keener) and a new boyfriend (James Gandolfini) pretty much simultaneously. Very quickly she figures out that they used to be married to each other. Instead of being an adult about it and just coming out with the truth immediately, she uses Keener's knowledge of her ex-husband to pick apart Gandolfini's flaws, thus poisoning their relationship. As I said, the leads are so charming that it's far too bad the script is mediocre (or, to be fair, straight up bad). There's a B-plot here that's actually quite good and should be its own movie: Louis-Dreyfus grows into a mother figure for her daughter's best friend (Tavi Gevinson, I believe is the actress' name). That ends pretty abruptly, too (though it works well that way in the film). Really, this is hardly a terrible film - it's perfectly enjoyable in its slight way - but Holofcener can produce so much better.",Enough Said
14,siderite,"Honest film about awkward adults, but that's all.",8,7 January 2014,"If you look at the ratings of this film, not only here, but on other sites as well, you gain huge expectations really really fast. It's a recipe for disappointment. The film is good, but is it that excellent as the ratings indicate? No. I blame it all on Gandolfini's death. It was his last completed movie and he was an actor beloved by everybody.But back to the movie, the main character is Elaine from Seinfeld who is a divorcée with a teenage daughter. Her best (and as far as I could see her only) friend is Toni Collette, who has only a small supporting role. She finds a new female friend and then she falls for some guy, only to find out that her friend and the guy were ex-spouses. The film is all about how adults face their feelings of incertitude and how they build or destroy their self esteem. Ultimately a story about a good person doing a crappy thing almost by mistake.All actors play well. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is almost not funny and looks really human and vulnerable, which is good. Gandolfini plays a great jovial, but grounded person, and it suits him. Catherine Keener plays well the female friend, but her role is kind of empty. I liked the movie, but if the conundrum was how to get out of the situation without hurting anyone, then the connection with Keener's character was really underplayed. I also liked the surrogate mother relationship with her daughter's teenage friend.Overall it was a good movie, a realistic situation featuring normal looking and acting people, which is always instructive, but it wasn't great. It did good exploring the feelings we have when we realize that we are not the good people we liked to think we were. Worth a watch, but don't build your hopes up.",Enough Said

16,StevePulaski,A delightful comedy and a comforting swan song,8,15 January 2014,"Enough Said is draped in romantic honesty and the commonalities of a contemporary middle-age relationship. It focuses on Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus of Seinfeld fame), a divorced, middle-aged masseuse who makes house-calls and tries to look after her eighteen- year-old daughter who is going off to college soon. When she attends a party with a couple of friends, she meets two people, one of whom a poet named Marianne (Catherine Keener) who requests Eva's services because of her bad shoulder. The other person she meets is a pudgy soul named Albert (James Gandolfini), a balding, divorced man with a fellow eighteen-year-old looking towards design school.Despite both Eva and Albert admitting they didn't find anyone at the party attractive, Albert asks Eva out on a simple dinner date, to which she accepts. The date goes very well, with both people talking like they've known each other for several years rather than just two days. The two get each other and that's what ultimately counts. She sees him as a sweet, good-natured companion whose imperfections (IE: his weight, his inability to whisper, etc) only make him that much cuter of a person. He sees her as a much-needed release from his ex-wife and a charming woman he needs in his life.Eva's perception, however, is greatly altered when she realizes that Marianne's ex-husband, who she has to browbeat and almost attack at every chance she gets when talking to Eva, is Albert and every derogatory comment she has made about her ex-husband is against Eva's new boyfriend. Because of this, Eva's perception of her new man becomes tainted, and the flaws are emphasized while his likability is greatly diminished.Writer/directress Nicole Holofcener paints a beautiful relationship in Enough Said, one with charming charisma and one of admirable simplicity. Holofcener clearly understands that middle- age relationships are difficult to pull off, because of things like busy schedules, jobs, and children, and she focuses on two characters aren't your typical, drop-dead gorgeous models like in several other romantic comedies. Just look at the poster for a film like The Ugly Truth, where you have a poster emphasizing the cuteness of Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. Then look at Enough Said's poster, which shows Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus simply sitting down and smiling, both of them not simply standing there and subtly saying ""look how good-looking we are.""Louis-Dreyfus is an actress I hope to see more of, providing her new program Veep isn't too time-consuming for her schedule. She possesses the charm few actresses can, with an illuminating smile and a wonderful way with comedic timing. And for a film that is practically Gandolfini's swan song, this ends his career on a surprisingly calm, humble note. The film shows a softer, more vulnerable side of the actor, rather than his cut- throat gangster image he became known for. This is a delightful change of pace for another actor who died far too young.Holofcener, in addition, doesn't neglect the impact secondary characters can have, as she writes in roles for not only Marianne but Sarah (Toni Collette), a close friend of Eva's who constantly chimes in about her relationship and is the host of an extremely awkward dinner between Eva and Albert but herself and her own husband (Ben Falcone). With that being said, there's a refreshing honesty to Enough Said's persona. A vibrant, easygoing awareness to the demographic of the middle-age who are in relationships but, like all of us, sometimes only see what a person can't give us instead of what a person can give us. This concept, however, is sadly pretty subversive. Starring: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, James Gandolfini, Catherine Keener, Toni Collette, and Ben Falcone. Directed by: Nicole Holofcener.",Enough Said

19,Hellmant,Gandolfini is once again awkward and kind of crude but ultimately very lovable.,9,27 December 2013,"'ENOUGH SAID': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) James Gandolfini (in one of his last film roles) co-stars with Julia Louis-Dreyfus in this romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. Holofcener also helmed such critically acclaimed movies as 2010's 'PLEASE GIVE', 2006's 'FRIENDS WITH MONEY' and 2001's 'LOVELY & AMAZING'. This film also co-stars Catherine Keener (a usual player in Holofcener's movies), Toni Collette and Ben Falcone. I think it's one of Gandolfini's best and most likable performances and Louis-Dreyfus has never been better or more lovable as well. Fans of honest and real romantic comedies should be more than pleased.Julia Louis-Dreyfus stars as Eva, a divorced massage therapist who is not looking forward to her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway), going away to college. She goes to a party with her friend Sarah (Collette), and Sarah's husband Will (Falcone), and meets Albert (Gandolfini). Albert is a divorced father who's also not looking forward to his daughter, Tess (Eve Hewson), moving away for school. Eva and Albert hit it off and begin dating, despite the fact that Eva is not physically attracted to Albert (due to him being overweight). Eva also starts giving massages to a client she met at the party as well, named Marianne (Keener). The two become friends and Marianne tells Eva a bunch of horror stories about her ex-husband. When Eva learns that her ex is Albert things become complicated as she doesn't know how to tell Albert or Marianne that she knows the other.The film is funny but in a very real way; I was really impressed with how much the movie felt so true to life. It has a lot to say about attraction and relationships, as well as family and divorce. Eva and Albert's relationship is the driving point of the film and the two lead performances really make the whole thing work. Gandolfini is once again awkward and kind of crude but ultimately very lovable. It's Louis-Dreyfus that really surprised me though. On 'SEINFELD' she was so self centered and unlikeable (like all of the characters on that show, except for Kramer) so it's really refreshing to see her be so adorable. She's really sweet and so is this film; Holofcener gives the movie the perfect touch once again and proves why she's an awesome indie film director. I really liked this movie and think most others will too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gmBnRGZV8o",Enough Said
20,Robert_duder,"A quirky, lovely little romantic comedy that is very different in style",8,17 January 2014,"One thing is for certain, Enough Said won't be for everyone. One IMDb reviewer called it ""mature"" and that's an interesting word to use because it definitely has this sort of coming of age feel but for a middle aged woman and to a lesser extent middle aged man. Its a big departure for both stars and both do very well in it. There are some underlying themes like ageing, growing up, and saying goodbye. It is hauntingly lovely at times and just a really beautifully done film. I couldn't understand when critics started noticing this film because I assumed it was just another romantic comedy but now I get it because in some ways this has an art-house quality to it but I think its mainstream enough to appeal to the general crowd but especially those 40+ I would hazard to guess and why shouldn't that demographic get a good movie. I still don't entirely get the title but I suppose that doesn't really matter one way or another. While it doesn't fit the typical bill of being a ""chick flick"" it is a mature woman flick in the way that you're watching this woman figure out her life and where she's going and coming full circle to finding herself or beginning to find herself.This is truly Julia Louis-Dreyfus' crowning achievement to date I think. She proves she's not slapstick or just a comedian by giving a heartwarming, often dramatic, emotional performance. I think I enjoyed this movie and her performance more afterwards when I stopped to think about it. She is darkly comedic and her intense facial expressions and dowdy clothing (sometimes) just makes her so down to earth and easy to enjoy. The late James Gandolfini is the object of her affections. They are an odd couple, they don't quite click physically, they're not really each others type and yet they work for the most part. This is a huge departure for Gandolfini and a welcomed one and he is great at it. Their chemistry is really good and their banter in the beginning is terrific dialogue and fun to watch. Its really a love story that feels real. Its not Notebook type passion but its two people making it work and falling in love amidst all the quirks of life, and work and family and friends. The supporting cast were all very good including Toni Collette and Ben Falcone (both of whom I would have loved to have seen more screen time from) as Dreyfus' best friend and husband, Catherine Keener as Dreyfus' client, friend and Albert's ex-wife. Keener is decent but as I usually find with her she's sort of bland in her line delivery and performance. Tracey Fairaway is very good as Dreyfus' daughter. She has some terrific emotional scenes and the chemistry between her and Dreyfus is really good. Tavi Gevinson is also very good as Fairaway's best friend whom Dreyfus clings to in the event that her own daughter is leaving for school.For an average length film there is a lot of content here. Its an emotional roller coaster and I can't tell you how much it grew on me the more I thought about it. When the first finished I thought...""yah that was okay"" and then it stuck with me and the more I thought about it, the more I understood and the more I saw underneath it all and what it was saying and doing. Director and writer Nicole Holofcener unapologetically makes a movie plainly aimed at middle aged women and she does it very well. Its a sweet movie filled with emotions and life changing moments and if you're looking for something different in the romance genre this is definitely it! I'm still not entirely sure that it deserved its Golden Globe nomination but at the very least I understand why they chose her because she is excellent in it (Dreyfus) and the film is one to check out!! 8/10",Enough Said
21,g-bodyl,Not Enough Can Be Said!,9,6 December 2014,"As a young man, I love my romantic comedies to be raucous and sex-crazy, but however I do like my mature romantic comedies every once in awhile and Enough Said is well-suited for that category. Not only I became interested due to the hype, this is James Gandolfini's second-to-last-role, which he completely nailed. The movie reaches sitcom territory at times, but the movie is undeniably charming and even bittersweet. The dialog feels very natural and the chemistry between the two main leads is through the roof.This film is essentially about two middle-aged people falling in love. There is Eva who is divorced and is worried about sending her only child away to college. Then there is the like-minded Albert who is a little round, but seems to be a very laidback gentleman. When Eva becomes a masseuse and a friend of Albert's ex-wife, Eva begins to question her decisions.The acting is unquestionably fantastic. Julia-Louis Dreyfus really need more film roles because she killed it as the quirky Eva who is trying to find some love. James Gandolfini plays a man outside of his type. Instead of a toughened, gangster-like character, his character is more likable and more curmudgeonly. Toni Collette does a good job as Eva's friend and Catherine Keener delivers a fine performance as Albert's ex-wife who always complains to Eva about him.Overall, Enough Said is a charming and surprisingly original entry in the field of romantic comedies. A rom com that is universally loved is a rare sight and this film happens to be one. It's charming, poignant, and even bittersweet. The realistic feeling and natural dialog is also what further enhances the film. I was checking out this film mainly because of James Gandolfini, but I'm glad I was able to watch this beautiful film about middle-aged romance. I rate this film 9/10.",Enough Said

23,secondtake,"A finely nuanced, beautifully acted slice-of-life",7,11 April 2015,"Enough Said (2013)We used to come up with the phrase, ""It's a Nora Ephron movie."" And we knew what that meant, a contemporary ""woman's picture,"" focusing on women and appealing to women viewers. Now there is a slightly more acerbic and less bubbly update, ""It's a Nicole Holofcener movie.""She might hate that idea—Ephron is a great writer but is sometimes maligned for being too glib and feel-good. And that's the pleasure of a Holofcener movie, a more real and delicate slice of life. This kind of aura depends on great acting—and we have that here. James Gandolfini is terrific, and his sometimes flame here, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, is his match. Both are nuanced and deeply engaged in a restrained and very believable way. It's right on.There are no pyrotechnics here, no outrageous turns of plot, no murders or improbable dramatics. Which means that this is not a roller coaster wild ride. It's just some normal people figuring out their lives. But so well done you get involved. It might not seem like enough sometimes, that the revelations of the main characters don't really matter enough, but that's how it is, that's how life is.So, yes, it works as a movie, and is absorbing. It sometimes skims clichés, especially with their children who are not developed as characters. But what it nails, it nails beautifully.",Enough Said
24,cosmo_tiger,I enjoyed it but the most depressing and real romantic comedy I have ever seen. R.I.P. Mr. Gandolfini. I give it a B.,7,3 November 2013,"""I've been listening to this woman say the worst things about the guy I'm starting to really like."" Eva (Louis-Dreyfus) is a masseuse and a single parent who is tired of being single. When she meets Albert (Gandolfini) at a party she is surprised when he asks her out. She has a few dates with him and begins to really like him and tells her new client about him and the client begins to bash her ex-husband. When Eva realizes they are talking about the same guy she is torn as to what to do. I was interested in watching this because my two favorite TV shows ever are Seinfeld and The Sopranos. I also went in a little depressed because being a huge Gandolfini fan I was saddened at his passing and knowing this was his last movie made it a little bittersweet. All that out of the way I have to say that I did like this movie but it is not a typical romantic comedy. Most movie like this are light, mostly fluff and leave you feeling happy. When this ended I felt sad and depressed. Some of it had to do with Gandolfini and some with the movie itself. While this is still a romantic comedy it is very real and that added to the sadness. I'm not saying not to watch this because I did like it but don't expect to have a super happy time watching it. Overall, good and worth watching but the saddest romantic comedy I have ever seen. I give it a B.",Enough Said

26,Reno-Rangan,In a mid life's reconciliation.,9,16 July 2014,"From the director who always portray women's perspective of stories. Sadly, it was one of the final movie of James Gandolfini. He just came and go in his movie that I did not noticed him till 'Welcome to the Riley'. I praised his performance in that flick and again he was so great in this movie, I totally impressed. This movie is about the divorced parents and their second chance to commit in a relationship. Very nicely and realistically told story which had plenty of humor.Eva, a middle aged single mother who works as a masseuse meets a divorced man, Albert at a party. It all starts as a casual meeting, then they begin to find similarities. Especially whose first marriage was broke and now they regret for that. So cautiously move their relationship to the next level who are desperately looking to work it out. In the end, every relationship got faults and how they are going to keep it going patching all the flaws is what the story explains.''I know this sounds corny... But you broke my heart.'' I found it so good. When there are no popular actors, then it must be a B movie or television movie, but in this case it is hard to differentiate. It was top class in all the category. A specially made flick for middle aged people. It was a romantic-comedy, but make us contemplate back to our life. The lead pair was excellent together, perhaps chemistry between them worked out. This kind of low budget with not so popular actors won't do great commercial business, but get appreciated in a small circle gives a fine support for future similar projects.Beside Gandolfini, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as well enchanted with her spellbind performance. She can make a good actress with story like this than being only a television star. She's not too far from taking a fine position like what Julia Roberts, and others doing now. I would love to see her again in a major flicks. This movie is not for everyone and I don't think teens (not every teen) would enjoy it than adults. It speaks about the life, the modern life crisis who faced divorce unintentionally. In one word, it is a beautiful portrait.",Enough Said
27,eddie_baggins,A breezy and enjoyable movie with some touching moments,7,29 April 2014,"It was a bittersweet feeling watching this 2013 drama/comedy due to the fact it features one of James Gandolfini's last roles but upon conclusion of the movie you feel it is also a fine tribute to the great actor in what was a finely written and different role for a man that was usually typecast into some type of tough guy/mobster role. It also helps that the movie surrounding the larger than life figure is also easy to love and warm to as well.Director Nicole Holofcener imbues her film with a warm and realistic charm that makes you feel compassion for almost all of the characters in the piece. Dreyfus who we all know is a fine comedic actress thanks to a little TV show called Seinfeld is a joy as the lovable and sweet Eva, a lady we are never not on side with even when she makes some questionable judgement calls, but Eva would be nothing without the backing up of the charming and sweet Gandolfini (not words you usually associate with the Soprano) as Albert.Albert is an everyman that seems grounded in reality and the film works with him and Eva being so relatable. Dreyfus and Gandolfini share a fine chemistry that on paper would sound just plain strange. It's a credit to the filmmaker behind the project that it works so well and a credit to the acting ensemble as a whole that this drenched in humor and pathos script is funny, realistic and sad in equal measure. Dealing with heavy issues in movies like this is fraught with the danger of being too comedic or to glum and Enough Said walks that line as good as any similar flicks did last year.An easy to like and breezy movie Enough Said is a lovely way to spend an hour and a half and despite not being overly memorable, it's a fine way to witness for what could be your last time the genius that was Gandolfini the actor and a reminder the Dreyfus is one of the best comedic actresses in the business.3 and a half guacamole dips out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Enough Said
28,Red-125,Star-crossed lovers (sort of),9,1 October 2013,"Enough Said (2013) is an enjoyable romantic comedy written and directed by Nicole Holofcener. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is Eva, a divorced massage therapist. James Gandolfini portrays Albert, also divorced, who meets Eva at a party. The chemistry seems to be there, and both Eva and Albert are slowly falling in love.However, ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" Naturally, there are complications. (No complications = no plot.) Both Albert and Eva have daughters who are leaving shortly for college. A friend once told me that students leaving home for college become obnoxious almost by instinct. That makes the break easier and less stressful for everyone. I don't know if that's a universal rule, but both daughters in the film appear to be following it. There's another sub-plot involving a friend of Eva's daughter, who is bonding with Eva, just as Eva's daughter isn't bonding.However, the main obstruction to romance is that Eva has a new friend and, by a very bad coincidence, the friend is Albert's divorced wife. So, Eva is playing a double game--dating Albert, and hearing all the annoying things about Albert that made his wife leave him. That would surely cause trouble and, of course, it does. You'll have to see the movie to find out what happens next. ""It's complicated.""My wife and I really enjoyed this film because it was well crafted, funny, and very well acted. Julia Louis-Dreyfus can act beyond her role in Seinfeld, and James Gandolfini could act beyond his role in The Sopranos. Of course, there's a melancholy cloud over the film, because we know that Gandolfini died soon after the movie was completed.Still, it's a pleasure to see two likable, talented actors making each other laugh, and making us laugh with them. The film will work well on DVD. If you miss it in theaters, be sure to see it on the small screen.",Enough Said
29,leonblackwood,Weak and Predictable storyline! 3/10,3,12 April 2014,"Review: I didn't really enjoy this movie. I found it slow and pretty boring. The storyline is predictable and the main character was a bit of an idiot. After seeing James Gandolfini play a mafia boss in the Sopranos for so long, it's weird seeing him play a quiet heart broken man, but it did touch me because it was his last movie. The comedy isn't that funny and it seemed to drag from one scene to the next. With other big name like Toni Collette and Catherine Keener, I was hoping for some intense drama, but this is more of a chick flick that needed a lot of work. Disappointing! Round-Up: James Gandolfini must have felt out of his comfort zone with this movie, but that just proved that he had a wide range and that he didn't want to be type casted throughout his career. He will be missed. The learning character, whose voice has been used in Planes and The Bugs Life, is more popular for her TV appearances so she isn't that famous in the UK. I certainly haven't heard of her name before so I can't compare this movie to any other performances. Personally I think that there is many other actresses out there that could have played her role much better. Toni Collette, who has a little role in the movie, could have been a much better choice for the leading role, but we will never know.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $25millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/dramas about a masseuse looking for love. 3/10",Enough Said
30,Ed-Shullivan,Listen to your heart...and not to your lovers ex wife's bitterness,8,2 November 2013,"My wife and I went out last night to see a movie that would help us relax after our dinner and Enough Said was perfect for our digestion. If you have an appetite for a light romantic comedy than Enough Said will not disappoint. The two main stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini play a pair of divorced and currently single parents who each respectively have a daughter who is going off to college in a few weeks. Through a chance meeting at an evening party Eva (played by Julia Louis- Dreyfus) and Albert (played by James Gandolfini) bump in to one another and exchange what appear to be a few meaningless words about the dating pool being a bit sparse at the party they are attending. Of interest to some viewers, this was the second last movie appearance by James Gandolfini before he passed away in June 2013 well before he should have. He is missed dearly.A few days later Eva's good friend Sarah (played by Toni Collette) who was also at the evening party suggests to Eva that Albert was interested in seeing Eva sometime. With a little bit of prodding by Sarah, Eva eventually agrees to a first date with Albert, and they enjoy each others company after exchanging a bit of information about their respective daughters, their divorces, and their now ex spouses. We as the audience are keenly interested in how Eva and Albert's relationship will blossom or blow up. Albert has a unique job as a Manager of a television archive library which he truly loves, and Eva works as a masseuse but she is not crazy about having to carry her heavy massage table up and down clients stair cases and listen to some of her customers' blather on to no end. One of Eva's recent new clients is a poet named Marianne (played superbly by Catherine Keener) who she coincidentally met at the same evening party that she first met Albert. Marianne appears to have a connection to Albert that we the audience do not take long to figure out based on Marianne's griping about her ex husband and the father of her daughter. Eva is very fond of Albert but she admits to her good friend Sarah that she is reluctant to make the same mistakes that she made with her previous relationship and her first husband. Even the difference in the way Albert is bringing up his teenage daughter leaves Eva questioning his parental skills compared to her own. These are two very different people Eva and Albert. They have different physiques. Eva is petite, and Albert is a big bowl of jelly who is very comfortable in his own skin and his pajamas. They have different home lives, and different career paths. Albert is definitely the more laid back person in this relationship and he is willing to hang out (sometimes literally without knowing) with Eva without hiding anything in his past life. Eva on the other hand is more judgemental and willing to give free advice to Albert and others but not so willing to be on the receiving end of criticism.Enough Said has many humorous segments and interactions amongst the main characters. The characters are all flawed (as we all are except you the reader of this review of course) and the story line if there is a message is to try and let bygones be bygones and move on with your life and learn from your mistakes. No one is perfect, so if you find a mate that your heart is saying warm and fuzzy things to you, tell your judgement to give it a rest because there is enough said!",Enough Said
31,l_rawjalaurence,A Sharply Observed Romantic Comedy of Manners,9,23 October 2013,"ENOUGH SAID is quite simply wonderful. Its plot is straightforward: a middle-aged woman (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) falls in love with a divorced middle-aged man (James Gandolfini). However the course of true love never runs smoothly, as the woman also becomes friends with the man's ex-wife. This ultimately leads to trouble. Within that straightforward plot, director Nicole Holofcener obtains two absolutely wonderful central performances. Dreyfus doesn't want to fall in love, yet finds herself inexorably drawn towards Gandolfini's shy yet bear-like personality. Physically imposing, he has a basic insecurity both about himself and his relationship with the two women in his life, his ex-wife and his daughter (Eve Hewson). Photographed amid the suburban sprawl of California, Holofcener explores the cracks underlying life behind the closed doors and immaculately manicured gardens. While the plot might seem familiar, the performances redeem the film, which is truly bitter- sweet and spell-binding. This was Gandolfini's last film before his untimely death; it stands as a fitting epitaph to a wonderful actor.",Enough Said
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Strong acting chemistry and raw honesty make 'Enough Said' highly relatable,7,22 June 2015,"Divorce is usually a detail assigned to a character to make him or her more complicated or provide some context for his or her world. Rarely does it play such an integral role as it does in ""Enough Said,"" the latest from Nicole Holofcener. Starring two actors still best known for their star-making television turns, there's a lot about second chances in this story of two middle-aged parents giving each other and themselves the benefit of the doubt.There's something so touching, raw and frankly surprising about the chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini. Louis-Dreyfus is certainly not known for down-to-earth characters and Gandolfini made his name playing a Mafioso, yet what they have on screen is tender and honest. Holofcener really gets them to click and appear so completely relatable.Much of ""Enough Said"" is simply these two navigating each other and their relationships with their children and exes. The only conflicts (though it's a big one) is when Louis-Dreyfus' Eva learns that Gandolfini's Albert is, amazingly enough, her new client/bestie Marianne's (Catherine Keener) ex-husband. Eva's fear that the truth will ruin both relationships pivots the narrative entirely around when Albert and Marianne inevitably find out.The simplicity is refreshing and charming in a way, but also leaves something to be desired. Holofcener sheds a lot of truth on divorced life and what it's like to raise an 18-year-old with your ex while moving onward, and the simplicity of her story allows this to really sink in, but it's not all that challenging. It's real and it connects, but there's no internal struggle for the viewer to have, perhaps because Eva's situation is so unlikely. The consequences of it all, namely the challenges Eva has with her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway) and Ellen's friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson) plus Albert's issues with his daughter (Eve Hewson), create some familiar, smaller conflicts, but they are ancillary at best.Yet it all comes down to Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini making a tangible connection to the audience. Their relationship is raw, awkward – not glamorized like most mainstream films targeting a 40- 60 demographic. In fact, Keener's character, among the least likable, represents that kind of Hollywood-So Cal sheen in a way, perhaps to highlight that distinction. Regardless, ""Enough Said"" strikes some resonant chords when it comes to relationships and not just romantic ones. Any film that can reach that level of depth deserves a wholehearted commendation.

33,Turfseer,Gandolfini's final performance saves film with major plot contrivance,6,28 January 2014,"There is one very good reason to see 'Enough Said' and that is of course the late James Gandolfini's performance. It was nice seeing him in a role where he played a character that was the opposite of Tony Soprano, the part he'll always be known for. Here he's a self-effacing, low key, 'good guy', probably close in temperament to the way friends and family have described him in real life.The film's inciting incident occurs when Eva, a divorced masseuse with a teenage daughter, is introduced to Gandolfini's character, Albert, at a party in an affluent section of Los Angeles. Eva also meets Marianne, a successful poet, at the party and she takes her on as one of her massage clients.The film proceeds slowly as Albert courts Eva. Despite his girth, Albert manages to charm Eva who confesses that she usually isn't attracted to large men but is gradually won over by his sense of humor.The break into Act II, occurs when Eva discovers that her new massage client (and newly found friend) is Albert's ex-wife. The main weakness of the plot hinges on Eva's decision not to tell Marianne that she's going out with Albert. The explanation given is that Eva somehow also likes Marianne and doesn't want to upset her. This, of course, is at the expense of her relationship with Albert.It's hard to believe that Eva, due to her poor choice, didn't anticipate that she would end up in such an awkward position like trying to hide in the bushes, to avoid making contact with Marianne's daughter, who she had met earlier as well as that even more awkward moment when Albert finds her at Marianne's house.The bulk of 'Enough Said' hinges on Eva's bad decision and one keeps wondering why she simply couldn't have been honest with Marianne from the get go. But of course if that's the case, there would have been no movie.As a character, Marianne is unlikeable and one-note, with her constant put-downs of her ex-husband. But she also serves the purpose of putting doubts in Eva's mind as to whether Albert is truly a good catch. Most of the complaints do seem trivial, including Albert's penchant for separating the onions in the guacamole and his inability to clean up after himself. But his rigid insistence that he does whisper (when he clearly doesn't), is a point, which, if I were Eva, would not overlook.Nonetheless, as things play out, Eva does realize the error of her ways, leading to the heart felt reconciliation at the film's climax.'Enough Said' also has a number of sub-plots best described as only slightly amusing. One involves Eva's daughter's friend, who enjoys spending quality time with Eva, much to the chagrin of her own mother.Julia Louis-Dreyfus is most enjoyable when she plays off of Gandolfini's self-deprecating humor. The banter between the two is what makes 'Enough Said' so engaging. Nonetheless, Eva's failure to come clean at the onset, resulting in the plot's complications, is not something I believe most people would have chosen to do in real life.",Enough Said
34,meeza,"Can't get enough of ""Enough Said""!!",10,24 February 2014,"The outstanding romantic comedy ""Enough Said"" is one of the best movies of 2013!!! Enough Said! My review is over! OK, it is not really over, as you know there will be plenty of puns said or written (pick ur poison) in my movie reviews; and this one is no different. Director Nicole Holofcener, who has mastered the art of independent romantic comedy movies, has developed her supreme film in ""Enough Said"". The movie stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva, a middle-aged divorcée masseuse and mother of a teen female on her way to college. Eva falls for Albert; he himself being middle aged, divorced, and a parent of a teen female on her way to college. During the same time of the Eva and Albert blossoming romance period, Eva befriends an uptight Marianne, who happens to be Albert's ex-wife; let's just say that Marianne does not think at all that Albert is a PHAT Albert. Holofcener again does not do hollow work with her expert direction and enigmatic screenplay of an independent movie, but ""Enough Said"" is her best. Julia Louis-Dreyfus had the right touch with her captivating starring performance as Eva the masseuse. The late great James Gandolfini was a hit with his low-key but attention-getting performance as Albert. Holofcener favorite Catherine Keener once again delivered with her supporting work here as Marianne.

Apparently, A.O. suffers from the same condition which plagued Ellen DeGeneres' character Dory the fish in FINDING NEMO: a microscopic attention span. There isn't ONE line in ENOUGH SAID which would make Adam Sandler crack a smile, let alone slap his knee.

She's a regular Iago, goading others toward evil-doing when she's not busy wreaking havoc in the hearts of men herself. It is indeed tragic that a key actor in ENOUGH SAID passed away before its release, putting a Hollywood Halo over this sorry flick. But the Emporer HAD no clothes, and ENOUGH SAID is no DARK KNIGHT by any stretch of the imagination!",Enough Said
36,estebangonzalez10,Provides some closure for Gandolfini's premature death,8,5 February 2014,"""I've been listening to this woman say the worst things about the guy I'm starting to really like."" Directed and written by Nicole Holofcener (Friends With Money and Please Give), Enough Said is a charming middle aged rom com that benefits from an incredible chemistry between James Gandolfini and Julia-Louis Dreyfus and a witty script. At first I had a hard time separating Julia's character from her sitcom roles, but eventually she began growing on me and I ended up enjoying her performance. The true highlight of the film however was the late James Gandolfini's performance. He was absolutely charming and delivers on a completely different range than what he showed in The Sopranos or most of his other film roles. Here he plays a very sympathetic and sweet middle aged divorced father who is having a hard time accepting the fact that his daughter is leaving for college. It was one of his best performances and he deserves all the accolades he's been receiving. Enough Said is one of those rare mature comedies that delivers authentic moments. It's a realistic and warm film that adults will enjoy. People who say that they don't make films for middle aged adults anymore should check this out. I am glad Holofcener is receiving so much love for this film because it's good to have a strong female voice in Hollywood. This is a film for grown ups about second chances and finding love after having failed in the past.Eva (Julia-Louis Dreyfus) is a divorced middle aged mother who works as a masseuse. Her daughter is about to leave for college and so she's beginning to feel the void her absence will cause. After going to a party with her married friends, Sarah (Toni Collette) and Will (Ben Falcone), she meets Albert (James Gandolfini) a divorced father who is going through a similar experience with her daughter. The two hit off pretty well and begin dating. At the same party Eva also meets Marianne (Catherine Keener), and she becomes one of her clients. Eva quickly becomes friends with her admiring her style and good taste, but when she discovers that Albert was her ex-husband who she speaks terribly of, she begins having second thoughts about starting a relationship with him. She continues to date Albert and befriend Marianne without ever telling them about each other while she tries to make up her mind about giving love a second chance.This romantic comedy drama is charming without ever being unauthentic or ringing false. It seems to hit all the right notes at the right time. I loved the scenes that Gandolfini and Dreyfus shared together, especially their first date. The scenes they shared together sitting on his front porch were also very touching and charming. Toni Collette's accent in this film felt a bit out of place, but I enjoyed the rest of the performances and every character was developed pretty well. The film does say something important about the power behind words and how much the opinion of someone we admire affects us in the way we perceive others and make decisions about them. Despite how much Eva liked Albert she let Marianne's perception of him influence her in the way she saw him. Enough Said is just one of those warm films that are hard to resist. Gandolfini truly shines here.",Enough Said
37,yusufpiskin,R.I.P Jim,8,1 September 2020,"James Gandolfini meant a lot to me growing up. I finished my first watch of The Sopranos just months before his death. I was young, and although I couldn't understand what was happening sometimes, I knew that Gandolfini controlled the show. I knew his performance was incredible. That show taught me at a young age that TV was more than just cartoons. It could be an art form. The Sopranos did that for me. So when it was announced that he had died, I was sad. During my life, there haven't been a lot of celebrity deaths that have really emotionally hit me. Sure there was Chuck Berry, BB King, Mary Tyler Moore, Erin Moran and Robin Williams. But James Gandolfini's had a larger impact on me. I knew he was one of the best, and he still is.This film encapsulates Jim as a person. This is truly one of his best roles ever. I honestly think he deserved to be nominated for an Oscar here. The script, for the genre, is pretty on point. It does what it needs to do, and does it right. This is truly one of the most underrated films I've ever seen and the fact that it doesn't get enough traction is criminal.",Enough Said
38,r96sk,A joyful watch,8,6 April 2020,"Very, very good. 'Enough Said' makes for a joyful watch.The chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini is outstanding here, the best onscreen romantic connection I've seen since Matt Damon and Emily Blunt in 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are great together, they raise the film up so much. All of the other cast are rather fine, too.Away from that, Nicole Holofcener et al. do a fantastic job at connecting everything else up. It's well shot, well paced and has strong dialogue, managing to avoid being cringeworthy like some in its genre can be.This is a very nicely made film, credit to those involved.",Enough Said
39,aharmas,Real People's Love Stories,9,19 October 2013,"""Enough Said"" is all about communication. Sometimes people say too much, but most of the time, there is not enough said, and matters get quite complicated. The incidents in the story might never happen, yet the delivery in ""Enough Said"" is so perfect and sweet that we don't mind. There are no fancy anything, except for a couple of restaurants which I supposed appeal to the sense of reality in the Westside of Los Angeles. Also, the maid is Latina, but who is checking? Gandolfini is literally in the middle of quite a messy situation, as the woman he meets has befriended his ex. Circumstances keep his girlfriend from revealing this rather bothersome fact, and unless they deal with the truth soon, it might be too late. We hope for a happy ending, but the clever script keeps us guessing and waiting until the very last minute.Dreyfruss is pretty good as the insecure masseuse who falls in love with a rather imperfect man, who might even have less self-confidence than her. It's lovely to see their interaction, as they discover how to live with their flaws, and the relationship slowly deepens. I liked seeing how almost every aspect of a normal life is explored: their baggage, their quirky habits and more. In here, people work, gossip, get tired, even go to the bathroom, and this is done without unnecessary profanity or resorting to inventing clever languages or situations.The true find, sadly is Gandolfini, who does beautiful work in what turned to be one of his last films. He is big bear of a man, sweet, self-deprecating, anxious to find a chance to embrace a loving woman and have a chance at happiness. He understands the role, and it's interesting to see how he gives it everything he has. His beard is grey, and he, like his counterpart dress the part. The common link for them is the ex-wife, a sophisticated, also a bit insecure poet who radiates her own type of loveliness and has me guessing about her sexuality until her very end. She's not a true villain, but it's the closest we come to it. Her part is to fester the relationship, without even knowing she is causing it, but we can't really dislike her because no one in the movie is perfect. It'll be up to them to make it.""Enough Said"" could easily fit in the 1930's. The only thing that tells us is contemporary is a few references to the habits of teenagers, but we do have families, and people who go to the movies or to a restaurant to eat and talk, though we are reminded that some of these eateries go out of their way to antagonize their clientèle by trying to be too hip, which is another real problem in today's world.This is a film that should be embraced for letting us look at real emotions, seeing in its characters reflections of ourselves.",Enough Said
40,Amari-Sali,Middle-aged romance: comfortable and sexy.,8,14 January 2014,"In one of James Gandolfini's last films we are treated to a, mostly, adult romance film. Which feels sort of rare since usually most romance stories star 20 something year olds, sometimes teens and kids as well. But, with the combination of Gandolfini, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Toni Collette and Catherine Keener trying to explore the complexity of new romance, being divorced with children and the issue which comes from combining the two things, perhaps things may change?Characters & StoryEnough Said focuses on Eva (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) who is a masseuse who has been divorced for 4 some odd years and is now trying to mentally prep for her daughter Ellen (played by Tracey Fairaway) to leave the nest for college across the country. So, outside of getting a hobby, she has decided to go out with her best friend Sarah (played by Toni Collette) and her husband Will (played by Ben Falcone) to a social gathering and what she gets out of this is a new friend/ client in Marianna (played by Catherine Keener) and a love interest in Albert (played by James Gandolfini).Now, though first unbeknownst to her, time reveals her new friend/ client is the ex-wife of Albert and during her massaging sessions, which become general friendly chat, Marianne reveals a lot of Albert's bad traits, which at first Eva doesn't notice because, seemingly, Albert is the first man she has really been attracted to since her ex. However, you see Marianne words poison their relationship as time goes on. Meanwhile Sarah goes through battles with her own husband, of which you constantly think divorce is pending, and while Ellen preps for leaving the nest, as does Albert and Marianne's daughter Tess (played by Eve Hewson), you see both parents, and children, struggling with all of their interpersonal relationships/ communication.PraiseWhat I loved most about the film is that up until the end, you can easily see this movie being stretched out into a HBO series, or mini- series, for it really does come off that good. To start, Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus have great chemistry in their scenes, and though their romance sort of blossoms quickly, you get quite comfortable seeing them together and watching their awkward, at first, conversations. Also, what I liked was that they didn't treat the film like they would a film with 20 something year olds. Their romance wasn't all consuming, but simply a joyous part of their life which still required them to work, take care of their kids, and handle other personal matters like their friends.Leading me to also speak on the people outside of Gandolfini and Louis- Dreyfus who are really the ones who push the idea of a series out there. While watching Collette, actually speaking in her natural accent it seems, with on-screen husband played by Ben Falcone, you see a story within itself, and then when you add the kids of Gandolfini and Louis- Dreyfus, especially Ellen's friend Chloe (played by Tavi Gevinson) there continues to be more and more people in the film who seem filled with a story to tell, but only end up supporting characters.CriticismLike with 90% of romance films, the film employs that usual pattern where the romance starts strong, tapers and then someone does something stupid, or has this secret, which wreaks the relationship. In this case, it is the fact Eva knows both Marianne and Albert which is the hammer which crushes Eva and Albert's relationship. And though you understand, to a point, Albert's reaction in discovering his girlfriend is getting dirt on him from his ex-wife, at the same time it is unfortunate the film decided to follow the usual pattern and didn't stick to remaining different from the rest of the romance films out there.Overall: RentalTruth be told, outside of The Sorpranos I am not too familiar with James Gandolfini's work, but with this movie it does temp me to look into his filmography. In many ways, he looks like a sweet, jolly, giant who has his own charm which compensates for him not having the traditional look of a male love interest. And considering this was one of his last films, of which has a very good cast, and story, that is why I am saying this is a rental. It is cute, may make you tear a little bit, and contains a few scattered laughs. Something definitely worthy of taking up your free time in my opinion.",Enough Said
41,jadepietro,More Than Enough,8,26 October 2013,"This film is recommended.There is much one can say about Nicole Holofcener's romantic comedy, Enough Said. One could start by saying that this is a charming film about mature adults falling in love with the notion of love. It's a small independent film that never seems artificial or manipulative. Enough Said basks in its own normalcy. Its ordinariness reinforces the believability in its well-written characters and their situations, a quality that is usually missing with the rom-com genre. While lovers are often of the mismatched variety with emotional quirks that become off-putting or forced, here the commonness is unusual and beguiling.One can also mention that the director has written a thoroughly entertaining story about middle age affection with substantial wit and insight. Aside from the strongly developed leading roles, she has also created interesting characters that, with some more rewriting, could have become strong supporting characters within their own story lines as their own film subjects. (One small complaint is that some of these minor characters never reach fruition by the film's end.)One can add that Ms. Holofcener has assembled a superb cast of actors who imbue their roles with a natural and refreshingly honest approach to their characters. Julia Louis-Dreyfuss plays Eva, a middle-aged divorcée who looks for love in all the wrong places and finally realizes the error of her ways. Her love interest is Albert (James Gandolfini), an overweight and funny divorcée who happens to be formerly married to Eva's new friend, a poet named Marianne. Obviously, Marianne doesn't share the same fondness for Eva's new beau and ex-husband, a fact which Eva learns and keeps secret from the arguing couple. Her girlfriend, Sarah, try to help her make sense of the dating world and her newly found relationship. It helps that Catherine Keener and Toni Collette play these friends. These fine actresses have yet to make a false impression with this reviewer. Of course, complications ensue. (The plot, after all, still does follow that silly rom-com formula of mixed messages and miscommunication.)One can further state that this is one of James Gandolfini's last and finest film roles. This sense of loss brings a sweet melancholy to his final role. His special persona and wry self- depreciation shines through. The special chemistry between this beloved actor and Ms. Louis-Dreyfus is the stuff that dreams are made of. The intelligent bantering, their precise comic timing, and line delivery, and Holofcner's clever dialog make Enough Said more than enough to admire and appreciate.

42,Movie-ManDan,"It May Not Reach The Highest Heights, But This Is Still A Big Beauty.",8,2 May 2020,"When you look at cinema's most classic shots, some images that come to mind are Marilyn Monroe pulling down her dress in ""The Seven Year Itch,"" the first shot of Vito in ""The Godfather,"" and Jack Nicholson saying ""Heeeeere's Johnny!"" In 2013, another image could be added to those lists: Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini sitting on the steps in the mid-life romcom ""Enough Said."" I know it took years for these images to become timeless, but after seeing the trailer for ""Enough Said"" in 2013, I knew that scene would reach immortality. Say what you will about the movie as a whole, I am saying that just that one scene of two icons will reach the timeless standard.The romantic comedy genre is on life-support. There is maybe one a year and one every few years that turns out to be good. The beauty about ""Enough Said"" is that it is targeted towards adults. This isn't specifically an ""adult film,"" but it deals with adult issues. So many of these recent romcoms are about teenagers and people in their 20s. The age difference is enough to bring originality to the table since not many romcoms these days are mid-life crisis films.Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays masseuse, Eva. Like so many other women her age, she is divorced. Sometimes massaging people really gets to her, but other times it helps her meet people. At a party, she meets Marianne (Keener) and they hit it off with Marianne becoming Eva's newest client. In the same party, Eva meets the overweight but charming Albert (Gandolfini) and they hit it off too. The friendship between Eva and Marianne is something to be jealous about, while the chemistry between Eva and Albert is beautiful. Sooner than later, Eva realizes her best friend and boyfriend used to be married. Uh-oh!One thing I love about the film is it's general look. The flick is beautiful. I know that it is mostly just sunny days and bright colours, but that helps the overall mood.This was James Gandolfini's last movie where he gives his best performance on the big screen. He is calm and loveable like a big teddy bear. He is best known for playing ruthless and violent characters in thing like ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Romance."" Gandolfini could have stared in anything for his last performance and it still would have been great, but I'm glad his final was a change of pace and that the movie was worthy of his talents.While the love triangle and subplots are great, the movie is unable to reach the standards that Leo McCarey and George Cukor set. As part comedy, ""Enough Said"" features some ticklish moments, but no hilarity. As part romance, nothing sizzles. But if these two aspects where stronger, the whole movie would have been timeless, not just the scene on the steps. Luckily, the movie presents so much charm and enchantment that it will make the viewer feel so happy. At least some positivity is elicited.3.5/4",Enough Said
43,raulfaust,Find your love,7,25 July 2014,"""Enough Said"" is a film that surprised me in a good way, due to the unexpected path that the story has gone to. The main actress, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, surprised me for playing a character totally different from what she was used to in ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"", even thought I really doubt she'd be able to do so. After seeing this picture, my considerations for her acting has just raised. The story is entertaining because it deals with everyday subjects, like kids becoming adults, ex-husbands and wives interfering in our lives, among others. However, what makes this story indeed interesting is the extremely embarrassing scene in which Eva gets caught; I don't remember seeing such a embarrassing moment in a movie in a long time, and it felt hard to kept looking at the television. I just wished Eva could've gotten away with murder, which sadly didn't happen. The only aspect that I disliked about this picture is the strange directing/editing; I mean, we can easily see cuts and cuts throughout many scenes, which may demonstrates that director doesn't have faith in his cast-- although the actors seem to be reasonably professional. In my opinion, ""Enough Said"" is another good drama from 2013 that deserves the recognition it has.",Enough Said
44,Sergeant_Tibbs,Charms your socks off.,7,29 December 2013,"Earlier this year we lost James Gandolfini. Although he already left a rich legacy with The Sopranos, it felt like he still had more to give us. I saw an interview with Julia Louis-Dreyfus yesterday and while she put on a brave face, when asked about Gandolfini, you could tell how deeply saddened he was by his death. Good thing that Enough Said is such a joyous and light- hearted film despite inevitably destined to be associated with his death. I'm a fan of The Sopranos and I've never really watched or liked Seinfeld, but it's a genius idea to pair these two actors up in such off-type roles. There was a huge goofy grin on my face when they were on screen together. They shed those past screen images with surprising ease and reveal effortless human beings. That's the beauty in their performances. It's incredibly funny at times and quietly poignant in others. But it's a gentle film in its very casual visual approach and lack of emotionally explosive scenes. Unfortunately the subplots really bog the film down. They don't add to the film's point and are just not up to the same quality. The daughter subplot is the only one close but it wasn't focused enough. However, Enough Said is still a very charming film with a mature look at adult love and second chances.7/10",Enough Said
45,leftbanker-1,"Movies Are Terrible These Days, This One Less Than Most",8,2 January 2014,"This is a story about a neurotic woman who over-analyzes every aspect of everyone around her except herself...a not very interesting woman if the truth be told.Why do romantic comedies always have to rely on some really uncomfortable twist in the plot to progress the story? I have to say that this movie isn't very funny so the word ""comedy"" here is being very generousnor is it very romantic as they make two middle age people getting it on seem pretty dreadful. The uncomfortable twist is that the protagonist learns that she is dating the ex of one of her massage clients. No problem, you just recuse yourself and move on but not in a Hollywood romantic comedy where you need to milk this absurd coincidence for everything it's worth (and it isn't worth anything as a plot device).And then when it is finally known that the protagonist is dating the ex of her client it's the dumbest moment in the history of film and something that intelligent people, intelligent writers would have avoided at all cost. In recent Hollywood romantic comedies this is absolutely essential for the plot development. Why? Why? Why would anyone write this idiocy into a movie script? At this moment she is a completely horrible person unworthy of respect or forgiveness.Furthermore, I wanted to take a bull whip to that horrible woman for the way she treated her house cleaner. People got their heads cut off in the French Revolution for a lot less. I also wanted to take a bull whip to the two daughters who were miserable girls.And lastly, if you don't like bad breath, or listening to inane crap, or lugging your massage table up a few stairs then get a new profession.Even at the end she didn't beg for forgiveness for being such a horrible cow as she should have.So why did I give this movie that I didn't like much an 8? The answer is because I'm over the creepy violence of most American movies. I also liked the fact that none of the people in the film were rich; they were just regular working folks.

48,maurice_yacowar,women lets gossip ruin her affair,8,7 October 2013,"Nicole Holofcener is the woman's answer to the manboy genre that dominates American film comedy. Judd Apatow represents that cycle at its best, bawdy macho tales about men who haven't grown up. Where these films respect women by sympathetically marginalizing them, Holofcener makes women her central characters, their psychology her primary interest and their self-realization her main objective. Of course, that makes her films vital viewing for men -- at least, those who want to have a shot at understanding women. Yeah, I guess it's also good for women to have a voice and a reflectionEnough Said is enough of an improvement over her previous feature Friends with Money (2006) that we can talk about her as a significant auteur. She writes brilliant, offbeat scripts, with prickly, funny dialogue, centered on a circle of close women friends that witness the central woman's descent and resurrection. Her new heroine, masseuse Eva (Julia Louis- Dreyfuss) is an elaboration of Jennifer Aniston's teacher-turned-maid in Friends with Money, a smart, plucky woman who hasn't a strong enough sense of herself to take control of her life. The first film would have been stronger had Aniston and Francis McDormand switched roles, ignoring Aniston's box office clout. Now Holofcener didn't have to make such compromises. Her blue chip cast is perfectly cast.In Enough Said the three central women are all in healing professions, but they are not healing themselves. In fact they're ignoring their own major issues by focusing on the trivial. In addition to masseuse Eva, who heals the body, Sarah (Toni Collette) is a therapist -- healing the mind -- who ignores her marital issues by constantly rearranging the furniture. Marianne (Catherine Keener) is a poet -- healer of the soul -- whose poems speak to the afflicted but she has no interest in the readers who thank her for saving them. Eva is so bored by her self-absorbed clients that she's jolted when one asks about her Thanksgiving plans. Patients and healers are all self-absorbed.Eva's reluctance to grow up is manifest in several ways. She is so dependent on her daughter that even before she loses her to college she tries to replace her with her daughter's friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson). Eva tries to cultivate a girl-friend relationship with Chloe, even advising her to give up her virginity. Only at the end does Eva marshall the self-respect to ask a strapping young male client to help her carry her heavy massage table up his steep stairs. Primarily, Eva lets her new friend/client Marianne poison her relationship with her new lover Albert (James Gandolfini). Eva lets her ramble on about what a terrible husband her ex was, without admitting that he's Eva's current lover. Unable to accept her own feelings for Albert, Eva lets Marianne unwittingly poison her perception of him. Eva buys Marianne's criticisms of him, however trivial. He swirled the onions out of his guacamole, he was fat, he was messy around the house. When Eva sets up a dinner date to get Sarah's professional perspective, she gets tipsy and critical and leaves Albert feeling he's just been on a date with his ex-wife.Marianne ended her marriage and Eva suspends her affection for Albert for the silliest of reasons. Little peccadillos are ballooned into problems. Like Sarah rearranging the furniture, both woman reject Albert because they demand perfection at the cost of a perfectly fine reality. That's Holofcener's message to women: Don't buy the popular culture's delusion that you can have a perfect life by getting the material details right and holding out for some dream man. It keeps Desperate Housewives running but it won't give you a happy life. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Enough Said
49,hall895,Charming comedy tinged by real-life sadness,7,2 August 2015,"Enough Said is charming, funny and enjoyable. For real-life reasons it is also somewhat heartbreaking. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini make for a great, if somewhat odd, couple. You'll love seeing them together. But an undeniable sadness hangs over the film. You can't help but think of Gandolfini's untimely passing, especially as the film makes jokes about his girth, jokes which now seem desperately sad and not at all funny. But this is a great performance from Gandolfini. It is sad that we won't see him on the screen again. But Enough Said is a film worthy of his superb talent, giving us one last great memory of the man.Louis-Dreyfus plays massage therapist Eva, divorced mother of a teenage girl. Her daughter is about to head off to college. Gandolfini plays Albert, divorced father of a teenage girl. His daughter is about to head off to college. Neither Eva nor Albert appear to be seriously looking for a relationship. But at a party they find one another and there is an obvious connection there. Eva, not physically attracted to flabby Albert, hesitates at first. But she finds herself charmed by this man. They become friends. Then they become something more than friends. It's a great coupling. Eva and Albert are great together, largely because Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are great together. This seemingly mismatched couple have great chemistry. Their relationship is charming, their interactions are witty, it's really fun to see. But there are complications.Albert wasn't the only interesting person Eva met at that party. She also is introduced to Marianne, a divorced, and rather pretentious, poet. Eva takes on Marianne as a client and quickly becomes good friends with her. And then things get a little messy. Here the film becomes a little obvious, it's not hard to deduce the plot's secret. But that doesn't really detract from the film, everything is clearly revealed rather quickly anyway. Anyhow, Eva finds herself in a bit of a pickle and she reacts badly, making a real mess out of things. You want Eva and Albert to be together but as you watch things play out you wonder if Eva deserves him. She screws up big time. There is a lot of hurt which will need to be overcome if there is to be a happily ever after to this tale.The situation Eva finds herself in, and the way she reacts to it, does seem a little contrived. And some of the film's initial charm does fade as Eva behaves rather badly. Albert deserves better. But Eva is not a bad person and, portrayed as she is with wonderful vulnerability by Louis-Dreyfus, she is a woman you still pull for in the end. Of course Eva is not the only vulnerable one. Albert has been hurt before. You hate to see him possibly hurt again. And Gandolfini captures the hurt, the pain, the vulnerability so well. It really is a startling performance. There is much to like about this film. It is well scripted, has great wit and some truly funny moments. It also has great charm and tenderness. Maybe it loses its way a bit in the middle there. The character of Marianne, played with icy coldness by Catherine Keener, throws a bit of a wet blanket over the film. But Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini are so good, and so endearing, you overlook any little quibbles with the film. These are two great performers who are absolutely perfect for these roles. You look at the characters and you can't see how they could possibly be a match for one another. Albert, so sloppy and huge. Eva, so stylish and tiny, looking as if she could fit into the palm of Albert's hand. In this case opposites really do attract. And it is good for us that they do. Because these characters, these performers, give us a film so easy to embrace. It is desperately sad that we won't see Gandolfini again. It is an absolute joy to be able to see him here, in a film which serves as a clear reminder of why he will be so missed.",Enough Said

More commendable than the film's capturing of the doubts and imperfections that come with any relationship—an inevitable trait that many movies (especially romances) tend to ignore—is the purpose and inspiration that seems absent when trying to find love long after the norm does. Logic may only have to be suspended briefly in this outing, as even the close-minded viewer will get roped in by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini's performances—sadly, the latter's final leading role.★★★½ (out of four)",Enough Said
55,Likes_Ninjas90,It excels well beyond efficiency to become memorable and even outright touching,8,10 November 2013,"Writer-director Nicole Holofcener and Julia Louis-Dreyfus were born in New York in the early period of the 1960s, with just a year between them. At a young age they also saw the divorce of their parents. Holofcener's stepfather worked as a producer on several Woody Allen movies, which allowed her to become an extra on the film sets. These are interesting contextual details because they filter into Holofcener's inspired comedy-drama Enough Said. The film is Allen-like in its grounded approach to relationships, where divorce is a central theme between several characters. Also like a Woody Allen movie, the film is almost entirely dialogue driven but beautifully written so that every line thematically reinforces the smart observations of Holofcener's own screenplay. The film contains personal observations on the way people lose perspective on relationships and how relationships are often forged with alternate motives. Holofcener creates and breaks down the binary between people's private thoughts and the public sphere of conversation. In each scene the characters often don't openly speak their minds but still want people to change. Sometimes they blindly speak aloud about other people and find that their thoughts can have a personal influence when others choose to listen. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is cast as Eva, who is a masseuse, and in the opening scene she tries carrying a heavy table upstairs while her client watches on without helping her. The purpose of the comedy and the character establishment here is to show how she is too passive and polite to ask for help. The public and private sphere of thoughts and conversations is also humorously and dramatically concurrent in the film's main narrative line. Eva meets a man at a party named Albert (James Gandolfini) who wants her number and they agree to date. What Eva doesn't realise at first is that she is dating the ex-husband of her client Marianne (Catherine Keener), who is a poet. When Eva realises they were a couple, she doesn't tell Marianne. She allows Marianne's grumblings about her ex-husband to manipulate her own feelings about her own relationship with Albert. Marianne describes Albert fat, a loser and awkward in bed and this impacts on Eva's viewpoint. These criticisms give Eva free reign to be insecure and distanced in her relationship because after her own divorce she's tentative about the future. The film makes surprising, poignant observations about generational change and the way people fill the voids in their lives. Eva's loneliness is compounded by the fact that she and Albert are both seeing their daughters leave for college. She starts making friends with her daughter's own friend and spending more time with her, which reveals the way people latch onto other to fill the void in the life. Marianne's attitude is similar but more selective and elitist. She says she doesn't have a lot of friends and fulfils that with Eva's friendship but also remains exclusive about who is close to her. All of the film's thematic ideas are enriched by the performances, which embody the fears, weaknesses and flaws of these characters. Julia Louis- Dreyfuss' work here is brilliant in the way that she makes us forget about her signature character of Elaine from Seinfeld. Her performance is poised by her supreme comic skills and genuine feelings of remorse for some of the mistakes her character makes. It's surprising just how emotional her performance is and she has rarely been better. There's real melancholy in the purposeful casting of James Gandolfini. He strips back a lot of the aggression and anger he brings to his most iconic roles and plays Albert as a nice, ordinary, sometimes scruffy man, who is tired from his divorce. It's sad the way characters comment about Albert's weight, not because it's mean, but because it seems almost biographical now. There's searing chemistry between these two actors because their characters enjoying gently ribbing each other and thriving off each other's honesty, until this value is thoroughly tested. What's also lasting about the film is the screenplay and the way that all the side characters including Eva's friend (Toni Collette in a funny, neurotic side role) further contribute in unison towards the larger themes of the story. A lot of film's today settle for having just a single narrative line. Yet all of the subtext and meaning in the film here is reinforced by dialogue and characters that employ Holofcener's thematic intentions. Shame on the studio then that produced the film's trailer with the bright idea of revealing one of the most critical scenes. Film scripts of this quality are rare today and shouldn't be spoiled so clumsily. It excels well beyond efficiency to become memorable and even outright touching.",Enough Said

You get to see the mistakes of life from many perspectives, and you can relate to a lot of what you will see. This movie takes the idea of knowing better the second time around, and then just sort of twists things up a bit. Gandolfini is a sweet lost middle aged man who just wants to love, and be loved, Dreyfus is just as lost, and going through many of the same changes in her life, and is surprised to find love where she would not have looked, if only she had not just met, his ex-wife, and if only she wasn't just the coolest. I Enjoyed this movie for the most part, it had some good fun, or even funny moments, and there is so much truth, and honesty here that it is enjoyable to watch.

Do overweight people deserve to be loved? This woman clearly was very hesitant due to the fact that he is overweight and could not fully express her affection becoming torn in the process between the poison spouted by his ex wife as well as expecting her circle to approve of him.Interesting, intelligent and heart warming would perhaps be a fitting finale to the great James Gandolfini.",Enough Said

However, I was taken back by how much I enjoyed this film and how easily I got into it. James Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus are awesome together, the story is easily engaging and attention-grabbing, the performances are strong as steel and the characters were terrifically written and felt real and authentic.

61,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Personal Touch,7,29 September 2013,"There's a 90's romantic comedy called MR WONDERFUL not too many people remember – probably because it isn't that good. The plot had Matt Dillon trying to set up with wife with one of many blue-collar workmates so that hopefully, after she marries, he won't have to pay alimony. What does this have to do with ENOUGH SAID, the last movie starring the late James Gandolfini?Well in MR WONDERFUL, James played an extremely sweet and shy man who also had a mysterious quality, making you want more and the scene only lasts a few minutes. That's the first impression of an actor mostly known for his lethal gruffness as a mafia patriarch in THE SOPRANOS. So it's not a huge surprise that James can play a role with subtle charm and cozy humor – one that doesn't entail anyone getting ""whacked"" in the process.But our main character is television staple Julia-Louis Dreyfus, who fares pretty well on the big screen as hard working masseuse and single mother, Eva. Her daughter is soon off to college and her best friend suggests she, like in all rom-coms, find a man. There's only one she kind of likes at a party, although he's got a weight problem and yet something clicks.Gandolfini plays Albert with casual dignity, yet not without a slight edge. Especially after Eva starts picking apart his shortcomings. He can't figure out the sudden change in this woman whose second date in a backyard ended successfully in the bedroom. But the audience knows full well what's going onThe twist and plot line are simple enough: Eva's new client, an earthy poetess who can't say a good word about her ex husband, is also becoming a pretty good friend. It turns out Catherine Keener's Marianne was married to Albert, and after hearing so many gripes, ranging from guacamole dip to sexual performance, Eva takes a second (and third and fourth and fifth) glance at the man she thought she really liked.While not drop dead hilarious, the humor's as subtle as the characters, who fit like an old shoe right off the bat. And while it's not easy picturing them in the romantic sense like imagining somebody's parents ""doing it"" they're a couple who can be themselves together. Which is the best thing ENOUGH SAID has to offer And that's saying something.",Enough Said

Yes, this is a movie that will appeal to an older crowd, especially if you have children or are divorced, and it's unfortunate that the younger sect will likely ignore it. It presents a very accurate perspective on parenting, especially as a divorced couple, and relationships at an older age. The dialog and portrayals of events/situations was very realistic and interesting enough to hold my attention.It would benefit each generation to see movies that realistically address a different generation, to give us all a better perspective of life in general. I personally think I'd have enjoyed this movie even in my 20s, but in my 50s, I loved it. So did those in attendance with me.

I was lucky enough to know Jim the man for 10 years as his close colleague and his pretend life partner, and for many more years as his friend. And it's Jim the man, the very dear man, that I will miss most of all."" - Edie Falco at the Emmy's for James tribute. The story is about a divorced woman thinks she has finally found a new man she can share her life with... the only problem is he turns out to be the ex-husband of her new friend. Enough Said is a lot different then I expected it to be before seeing the film. I was expecting the same romance cliché movie with the long fallout and the women or man start to feel bad and towards the end they both realize that they idiots so they get back together, riding off into the sunset. Enough Said has some of those clichés but took a much different turn and for the best, because Enough Said is both a great comedy, good romance movie and realistic movie viewing relationships and people's chemistry today. Now I already did a tribute to the late great James Gandolfini in my The Drop review but in that movie he pretty much played a nasty mob type of guy that's a little bit like Tony Soprano without the angry problem, but in this his a big heart guy that's so sweet and lovable it makes me sad that James is really gone because James Gandolfini pretty much plays himself, a big lovable human being. James Gandolfini did a magnificent performance in this movie and a performance worth remembering for. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was also great in the movie as she plays the funny, always smiling wife that screw's up a couple of times in the movie, basically real life. It's not like she's the bad guy here (or women if you must) as every time she tries to do something right when it comes to problems she somehow makes it ten times worse and every time this happens I can see the look of destroyed failure in her eyes and that's due to the brilliant acting from Julia Louis- Dreyfus, she really fitted the character so well that she gives her character ark that worked brilliantly. The chemistry between James and Julia was both cute, charming, interesting and straight up adorable. I think the writing and the directing is the real reason why the chemistry worked because every time these two talked they will always have something to make me and probably everyone else to smile at are adorable together. Now for the problems: I don't have problems with the movie to be honest, but I'm not going to give it a best rating I got because I don't really think this movie is on the level of amazing or groundbreaking, but it's still a sweet little movie. Overall Enough Said is a great movie with great performance from everyone and brilliant directing and writing.",Enough Said

66,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Little gem of a film, and a coming of age story for empty nesters",7,18 April 2015,"There are movies and there are films - Enough Said is wonderful little film that focuses on coming into later-adulthood in a really marvelous manner.As with most of independent films, Enough Said is a verbose film that focuses on the characters and their real life struggles in a slightly exaggerated but entertaining fashion.Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a slightly faulted divorcée and single mother, soon to be empty-nester, struggling in the dating scene for the over forty. When she meets a nice man named Albert at a party, played by James Gandolfini, things seem to take a turn for the positive. At the same party, she meets a worldly poet (Catherine Keener) who becomes a new masseuse client and friend. Things become complicated when the degree of separation between these three characters is revealed to be closer than first thought.If anyone has ever told you that a 'coming of age' story can only be for those burgeoning adults facing the real world, they are mistaken. Enough Said is a coming of age story for grown-ups who face the next step of adulthood.Enough Said is smartly written to examine the trials of true adulthood in a comprehensive manner. Topics typically resigned for fleeting character traits are instead used as wholly centered subjects of this film, specifically: parenthood, long term marriage, and divorce. And yet, despite being typically depressing subject matters, Enough Said keeps the film light with smart humor.If a film is to use its characters as a tool for a film, the characters need to be complex, original and endearing. Enough Said fits the bill and Julia Louis-Dreyfus shines alongside James Gandolfini. Neither character is perfect or flawless, but are portrayed with real life complexity.Enough Said is dialogue driven so those hoping to find more action and 'events' might want to skip this film. Adults who want a great film should check it out, as there are only positive things to be said for this little gem.Please check out our website for complete reviews of all the recent releases.",Enough Said
67,shawneofthedead,"A rom-com that's one of the finest films you'll see this year, in any genre.",8,22 December 2013,"Romantic comedies are predictable even for fans of the genre. Beautiful girl meets gorgeous guy. They're clearly made for each other. Invariably, they fall madly in love. But something or other gets in the way – a narrative obstacle that's serious enough to break them up but not drastic enough to keep them apart forever. Cue tears, misunderstandings, tantrums and more, until the inevitable happy ending trots along to wrap everything up neatly. It's all so painfully predictable that fans of romantic comedies now feel the need to qualify their taste in films: ""I know they're terrible/predictable/silly/unrealistic/etc, but I like them anyway!"" In other words, we're a long, long way away from the heyday of the romantic comedy in the 1930s and 1940s – when screwball ruled Hollywood and the films being produced were the finest in any genre.Fortunately, every once in a while, films like writer-director Nicole Holofcener's Enough Said happen along – films so warmly romantic, funny and realistic (after a fashion) that they prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there's life, quality and potential yet in a tired genre.Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a divorced massage therapist about to send her grown-up daughter off to college. She meets Al (James Gandolfini) at a party, and strikes up a sweet, tender relationship with him – without realising that her newest client Marianne (Catherine Keener) is Al's bitter ex-wife. Instead of coming clean when she first makes the connection, Eva remains friends with Marianne, picking up details about Al's greatest failings and foibles along the way.A sillier, more farcical version of Enough Said could easily have been made – one that plays up the more ridiculous nature of this unusual love triangle: one side love, one side hate, one side initially blissful ignorance (on poor Al's part, at least). It would have, invariably, wound up on the ever-growing trash-heap of today's rom-coms: bland, silly, forgettable.Instead, Holofcener has crafted something far finer and wiser: Enough Said is a sunny, charming comedy of manners, deception and relationships that cuts surprisingly deep. The film is startlingly powerful as an examination of the ebb and flow of a relationship: the way in which it can shift, deepen and curdle with the simplest of gestures. Eva and Al's courtship unfolds in the gently awkward way real relationships do, as they test each other's comfort zones and senses of humour. The connection between their characters feels genuine and not forced.There are no outrageous, contrived twists breaking Eva and Al up: it's all on Eva, as she stumbles through her awkward friendship with Marianne towards inevitable disaster. Eva's slow, agonising betrayal of Al's trust – for that is what it is – is treated with maturity and intelligence: it's something we can imagine ourselves doing in her situation, a complication wrought by human curiosity and error rather than the typically ludicrous twists that break couples up in more traditional rom-coms.Louis-Dreyfus, radiating charm and sunshine, is a huge reason why Holofcener's film works as well as it does. She makes Eva enormously sympathetic without ever suggesting that she is anything but a normal human being with her own pile of issues to sort through. In Louis-Dreyfus' skillful hands, watching Eva puzzle through her feelings towards Al in light of Marianne's complaints proves enlightening rather than alienating. It might be reprehensible, but it's also understandable, rich with insight into relationships, secrets and trust.Enough Said is, tragically, Gandolfini's final film – and one of his handful of lead roles on the silver screen. It's a fitting farewell to an excellent actor, one that sees him eschew the histrionics and drama of some of his more flamboyant supporting roles. Here, he inhabits Al's burly frame with teddy-bear sweetness, lending him a quiet dignity as he finds himself increasingly, eerily reminded of his ex-wife with every day he spends with Eva.Perhaps most impressively of all, Enough Said takes all the tropes that you've come to associate with rom-coms, and gives them a little spin for the better. The boy and girl here are a man and woman who have lived through their share of life and heartbreak. They meet, and fall in love: not in a saccharine-sweet montage of horse-drawn carriages and kisses atop the Empire State Building, but in long conversations and through meeting each other's daughters. There's even a sardonic best friend who provides comic relief, except here, she's a woman who feels frustratingly suffocated in her marriage, played with an undercurrent of sadness by Toni Collette. It all adds up to the finest, sweetest, deepest romantic comedies in years – a film that glorifies its genre while being so good that it comes rather close to transcending it.",Enough Said
68,inframan,Elaine & Tony meet kewt...,1,24 April 2015,"I was really looking forward to this film, mainly because I really liked director Holofcener's previous efforts, Walking & Talking & Please Give. However this to me came off as a trite, predictable sitcom episode guest-starring Dreyfus & Gandalfino doing their usual shticks. Hahaha.Particularly irritating are Dreyfus's constant mugging & over-acting to every situation in every scene in order,I guess, to please to her fams. Gandolfino mostly shrugs his way through his part, looking bored & maybe even a little embarrassed & never upstaging his co- star but never being very funny, either.

The script just seems to be making little gestures in the direction of interesting topics (marital compatibility and compromise, empty-nest anxiety) without really exploring them, and the premise is pretty flimsy—Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character, Eva, can't bear to tell her awesome new friend Marianne (Catherine Keener) that the guy she's dating is Marianne's detested ex (and vice versa). That might be enough to sustain a sitcom episode, but not a whole feature film. And seriously, if you were dating a guy with a very weird job—like curator of a digital archive of classic TV shows— wouldn't you be inclined to share that fact with your new BF? Guess I don't like movies that raise questions that have answers like ""If she did, there wouldn't be a movie."" I couldn't even see Catherine Keener and Gandolfini (!זיכרו לברכה) as incompatible exes (it's not the pudge factor— Kate and Oliver Platt made a great married couple in ""Please Give""). The other mildly quirky characters (Toni Collette and her ditzy maid and her dorky husband...) can't do much to fill in the background, and JL-D's forced to fall back on comical moues and mugging.

72,mcjensen-05924,Despicable Elaine,2,2 September 2021,"JLD cannot or will not abandon her persona as Elaine. Her facial expressions and manner of speaking are pretty much the same in every role she has taken. In this movie it doesn't work. Her mugging for the camera becomes very tedious early on, and while the dialogue is sharp and witty at the beginning saidy it isn't maintained throughout the duration of the film. The coincidences in the relationships pile up to absurd levels, and many characters aren't needed here for any purpose. Toni C. Is an example. There's a horrible scene where her and JLD are talking where the camera goes back and forth with closeups of them. Poor editing and annoying. The ""kids"" do a decent job although as typical in movies they're portrayed as far more mature that their years. JLD's character morphs into a very insecure and shallow person, and nobody in their right mind would want to pursue a relationship with her. If two people didn't deserve to end up together it was the two in this film. The only relatively likeable character is the lead man, who was funny and down to earth and you could relate to him. Catherine K. Was given a role where she just constantly nagged about her ex, who coincidentally was who JLD was seeing. Right. Changes are ridiculously low of that ever happening, but when JLD just takes everthing she says to heart and rips him apart at a supper party you wanted her to catch on fire. She was horrible, all the time overacting and making those weird facial expressions. The ending was sappy and unsatisfying. This is why so many of these movies fail. Hollywood really thinks regular people act and behave in reprehensible ways because that's how they are in their own sheltered world. But if you like happy endings where everyone wears nice clothes and drives new cars and lives in modern quaint homes this will suit you fine. When adults sit around arguing like children squabbling about inane stuff if just doesn't add up to a pleasureable viewing experience. There's a side story about Toni C.'s maid that goes nowhere and is just plain idiotic too. Could have been something special if it didn't slip into formalatic overdrive.so early on.",Enough Said
73,herbqedi,Seinfeld for the Fifty-something set - Disappointing,5,14 February 2014,"I was looking forward to what had been described to me as an offbeat and whimsical independent romantic comedy. What I got was more Thirty- something dramedy with Seinfeld-ish quirky mocking humor (at least they spared me the ugly baby jokes), self-conscious direction and camera- work, and no real plot. JLD's Eva was very similar to her characters such as Seinfeld's Elaine and Old Christine, a pretty woman with a nice smile whose pettiness and annoyance with everything undermines her aspirations to make her life better. Gandolfini is perfectly cast and delivers a solidly nuanced performance in the male lead. Side note - Toni Colette is one of my favorite all-time actresses but she's horribly misused here in a character that starts out being mildly eccentric and is consistently photographed in close-ups that make her big head seem enormous. But what was really disconcerting was the way her Australian accent filtered in and out, mixed with something else, but not at all sounding like her natural Australian self in her early movies. Just one of many examples of missed opportunities with the talent at hand. One thing the director is obviously trying to do is show us the good and bad of all her characters. This is admirable, but like the camera-work, alternately jarring and brilliant - but more former than latter. The attraction to the creators of doing an independent film is the ability to express yourselves artistically bu doing jarring things different from the norm. As Keener's Marianne alluded with her poetry, art is open to interpretation but only idiots don't get her poems. I think the filmmakers may feel the same way, As art, draw your own conclusions, as entertainment, there was enough enjoyable and thought-provoking here to watch it all the way through, but not enough to enjoy doing so very much.The movie is not without its interesting insights. Some reviewers saw Keener as one-note; I vehemently disagree - she got the nuances of her talented poet character whose only other friend was Joni Mitchell very well. Nothing is universal but poets tend to be prone to introversion and depression. They feel misunderstood by the masses. The scene where she is obviously unmoved by the adoring fans who recognized her and tell her how their poems changed their lives is perfect. Keener could not have been more dead-on with her portrayal - more interested in witching about how her ex-husband was uncouth and couldn't get her poetry than noticing how uncouth she was being with young women whose lives she had affected. That's what's so frustrating about this movie - it has wonderful moments such as this but focuses more on the dysfunctional way Eva runs her life. Building resentment from what she's not wants but is not getting without knowing how to give - except to equally dysfunctional women such as Maryann and Chloe (another subplot that went nowhere). Interesting observations that stop short of being insights and turn out to be more frustrating paths leading nowhere than entertainment for the viewer. Back to the Seinfeld comparison, in the end, this is a movie about nothing. It has some witty humor but more ridicule humor and misanthropy. In the end, Enough Said leaves its characters pretty much in the same place where they started. Enough said about Enough Said.",Enough Said

75,Bravesfan17,Nicole Holofcener Puts Together a Nice Romantic Comedy,8,28 September 2013,"I got to watch this new romantic comedy from writer-director Nicole Holofcener. I always find myself interested in seeing what women do behind the camera, and Miss Holofcener does a nice job with this cast and script she wrote.Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a masseuse who spends her days going to her customers' houses and gives them their massages while hearing them talk about their lives. At the same time, she dreads about her daughter going off to college. She goes with her friends Will (Ben Falcone) and Sarah (Toni Collette) to a party where she meets some new people, two in particular. Marianne (Catherine Keener), a poet who becomes a new customer for Eva. Eva also meets Albert (James Gandolfini), who is a TV historian. At the party, Eva says that there is nobody there she is attracted to. Albert says the same. Later, Eva finds out that Albert is interested in her, so they go out. Eva is very happy with the date and the two become romantically involved. Shortly after, she keeps giving Marianne massages regularly and the two become friends. The only complaint Eva has about Marianne is how she rips on her ex-husband too much. Albert also complains about how terrible his ex-wife is. After, Marianne complains about one specific detail regarding her ex, Eva realizes the man she is hearing about is Albert. After finding out that it is him, Eva is doing everything she can to balance being a girlfriend to Albert, and being a good friend to Marianne before things go wrong.Nicole Holofcener does a very nice job as a director and shows a talent for telling this story that she also wrote. She does a nice job at keeping us interested in Eva and how she manages to balance her life of knowing this couple while worrying about her daughter's impending move. Holofcener creates a funny, witty script that also stays interesting throughout. She also does a nice job directing the cast she has put together.Julia Louis-Dreyfus does a great job at the front and center of this ensemble as Eva. For Louis-Dreyfus, this is a nice departure from the sitcom world. While this role shows Louis-Dreyfus doing some good dramatic work, she is still funny in the role. She makes the role work really well as the hard working single mother who wants a new romance and to help out her daughter and friends. James Gandolfini is also very great as Albert. As Albert, Gandolfini shows us a man who has a big heart and really likes Eva. Gandolfini also does some nice drama and comedy work here as a guy who cares. Catherine Keener is good here as Eva's new friend and customer who shows a good side and bad side to Marianne. Ben Falcone and Toni Collette are funny as the married couple who bicker a lot.",Enough Said

It popped up on terrestrial TV and after watching for a few minutes I did not want to stop.The two leads are two of my favourites and it is a fabulous pairing. I was wholly engaged and fully believed in the characters. It is warm and gently emotional romantic tale, very well written and apart from one of two bum lines, it came across as authentic.

78,ligonlaw,Mid-Life Romance,8,14 November 2013,"The story of two mid-life divorced people, coping with their character flaws,is a well-told and directed by Nicole Holofcener. The lead characters are played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini. Strong performances by supporting characters all around make this film feel like an ensemble cast, not just the story of two people. Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a divorced masseuse who schleps her massage table around town, rubbing her clients' sore muscles and half-listening to their monologues. She is the invisible servant. She meets Albert (Gandolfini) at a party a moment after she tells her friends that there are no attractive people at the party. They have things in common. They both have daughters who are heading to college. They are both divorced. They fall into a comfortable pace with each other. Life has bruised them but they are comfortable with themselves. The script has many great lines and brings us some unexpected delights in the conversations we overhear. Louis-Dreyfus plays a character which is not unlike her character in the television series ""The New Adventures of Old Christine."" She is always torn. She is co-dependent and has difficulty drawing boundaries in her life, but she is very likable. Louis-Dreyfus is extremely charming in this role. She could be nominated for this performance at awards season.This is Gandolfini's last performance. He died after the film was completed. As TV's Tony Soprano, we have seen him play the thug with a lot of problems. Here, as Albert, he is a sweet slob licking his wounds from the divorce. He is comfortable with himself. Gandolfini will surely win an acting award for this performance. His Albert is a complete character, and we believe him. Gandolfini makes him real.Both characters convey the sense that they are attracted to each other because they can truly be themselves together, Pretense is not necessary. The story puts Ava in a most difficult position when she meets Albert's ex-wife. Romance in middle age is sometimes very uncomfortable because of the onset of physical decline. The story explores some of the uncomfortable problems. This is a warm, gentle film about adults who don't have their lives together. See it.",Enough Said
79,themissingpatient,Mature & Honest,7,14 January 2014,"Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a masseuse named Eva. She meets two people at a party that she becomes very close with. Catherine Keener is a poet named Marianne who just happens to be looking for a masseuse. James Gandolfini is Albert, a big-hearted big guy interested in Eva. Eva and Albert connect through a shared dread, a great fear of coming loneliness, as both of their teenage daughters are leaving soon for college.This begins are your typical indie dramatic romantic comedy. It's sweet, full of genuine heart but lacks delivering any real laugh-out-loud moments. The best of them put us in the shoes of it's characters, as this one does. Middle aged, divorced, with kids and dating. It's not the story that keeps us watching, it's the characters.It almost seems Nicole Holofcener wrote this role specifically for Julia Louis-Dreyfus. James Gandolfini is great playing a single father of a teenage daughter. It's different from what we usually see him doing, it's refreshing.Enough Said doesn't deliver an unforgettable story but instead gives us real-life characters in very dramatic situations.

81,Kicino,Interesting story but weak script and too many distracting side lines,6,8 February 2014,"I really like Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) in Seinfeld and I thought Enough Said would be a heartfelt romantic comedy. While the storyline is interesting, the execution is quite weak with great room for improvement. I did not expect to see another Elaine but Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is just another Elaine except she is older – a divorced masseur who has a college-bound daughter. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) at a party who is also a divorced parent with a college-bound daughter. They go out a few times afterwards and it seems there is some attraction going on.At the same party, Eva befriends Marianne (Catherine Keener), a poet and a potential massage client. After a few transactions, they become very good friends and Marianne begins to pour herself while Eva shares her excitement with her new date. Very soon Marianne starts to badmouth her ex-husband.The interesting part begins here when Eva tries to get some insights of her new dates and finds out his identity. I can sympathize with Eva that she wants to learn more about Albert from other people, but as a modern woman and a fellow divorcée, she should be smart and rational enough to filter what she hears from his ex, which is susceptible to be biased. I can't help but feel sorry for her when her judgment and hence behavior become clouded by his ex's comments and hence her behavior could be hurtful to Albert.That's about it for all the interesting and positive part of the movie. The supporting cast are more enjoyable to watch than the main actors. Marianne play excellently as a bitchy, snobbish, and rich single mom. Toni Collette plays the role of Sarah, a therapist and a very supportive friend who is obsessed with firing her domestic helper. What a waste to put her in such a minor role.In addition to being another Elaine, Louis-Dreyfus's acting is too exaggerating and superficial. Albert seems to be quite a boring character although he is trying to appear to be a relaxed and carefree slob who has good sense of humor. But I really cannot find Albert attractive in spite of his figure. His sense of humor could make up for it but his jokes are not funny either. I also do not see any sparkle between the couple although they say they like each other. So it seems a double disaster (bad acting and script).On the script, there are also too many sidelines – Eva's relationship with her daughter, daughter's friend always hanging around, and Sarah's relationship with her maid and husband etc – all of these have very little to do with the main plot and serve no purpose (bad plot and script). Sometimes I wonder what Woody Allen would do for the same story. The writing is way weaker than Sex in the City though the poster compares these two works together.On the whole, I find the story development too bland, the plot too unfocused or too ambitious and the humor too lame despite the interesting storyline with good intention.",Enough Said
82,Aristides-2,Deal Breaker,5,8 February 2014,"When Eva learns from the unknowing Marianne that Albert was her ex and doesn't tell her right there and then about her relationship with him, my sympathy with her went down the drain. Finding out early in a beginning-to-look-serious match something so serious, doing nothing about it and continuing the friendship with your new friend and your new lover is a romantic deal breaker; anyone who behaves this way has a seriously dented character. It was an awful thing to do to a person you were falling in love with. (The wit displayed between Eve and Albert, before this, and the fine acting of Ms. Dreyfus and Mr Gandolfini kept me from giving the movie the '1' rating it deserves.)",Enough Said

I made it more than halfway through, which is an accomplishment, I guess. This is a pretty typical movie about a bunch of -frankly self absorbed- middle aged divorcees who are overwhelmed by parenthood and modern life, and are looking for a blissful relationship.The dialogue is intended to be ""adult"" but really comes off as whiny and entitled. These characters think that life owes them something. Their discussions seem petty and trivial.(I realize that's the whole point. If you enjoy this sort of thing then you will probably like ""Enough Said"".) I hate to be that guy, but Catherine Keener plays the same frumpy, typecast best friend that she plays in almost every movie.

Thankfully it wasn't.You never really know how good an actor is until you see him (or her) do something completely different than what you're used to. Gandolfini was incredible in this role, making you forget Tony Soprano or anything else he's done. He completely loses himself in the role.Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I haven't seen since Seinfeld so I'm not as familiar with all her talents but this character definitely wasn't Elaine Bennis.

86,mamalv,Sweet and wonderful adult romance.,8,21 January 2014,"To say that I love this film would indeed be an understatement. I found it to be sweet, poignant and just wonderful. This shows us what a loss we have in the death of James Gandolfini. His portrayal of the divorced father who for the first time in a long while feels he can open himself up to love is one of the best ever on screen. No mushy scenes, no status quo lines, just a real sense of adult romance. Julia Louis- Dreyfus is the perfect choice here. She is also sort of lost not finding anyone that she also can open up to. When they meet, they both say they haven't found anyone attractive at the party. But she takes a date with him any way and finds that he is funny, and sweet, and decides to give it a try. She is content until she meets, without knowing, his ex-wife and she finds she can't stop listening to all the negatives about him. It is like being in a train wreck but you can't stop. All this interferes with the relationship, until she too, starts to berate him about everything. He walks away, and when she goes to see him about it, he says she hurt him. This is probably the best scene in the film, showing us again how he could go from a mob boss to an ordinary guy, with apparent ease. Gandolfini deserved all the accolades he received for this film. He will be missed.",Enough Said
87,TheMovieSnob247,A fantastic feel good film and criminally underrated!,9,27 August 2014,"Five minutes into this film, I knew I was going to love it; this is clearly a hidden gem. It's a charming yet hilarious comedy about middle age romance and second chances. James Gandolfini (The Sopranos) delivers a very unique, subtle and gentle performance that is the complete opposite of Tony Soprano and the kind of characters he was known for. And you know what? I love it! Together with Juila Louis Dreyfus (Seinfeld, Veep), they have undeniable chemistry on screen and are very convincing as a couple who are discovering how well they go together. Dreyfus also steps out of her comfort zone with some touching moments as a mother that make it clear she can do more than just comedy (this was news to me to be honest).Both actors take a step her outside of their usual roles and are so effective that it really elevates the film. It also had some interesting takes on how sometimes we can sabotage relationships because of our own insecurities. I put off watching this knowing he recently past away as I thought I'd be bummed out, but it was the complete opposite. This is the kind of film that is hard not to love because it has so much warmth and contains a fun, whimsical soundtrack. Ultimately, in the end, this is very much a feel good film. As one of Gandolfini's last roles, this is a fantastic performance to remember him by. One of the best of 2013 and highly recommended. Don't miss this!Was my review not horrible? Awesome!

88,LordJiggy,"Funny, honest, smart, and bittersweet.",7,30 January 2014,"Bittersweet, of course, as it was one of James Gandolfini's last films before his sadly untimely death. Melancholy, too, as his sweet, smart, and gentle portrayal of a fundamentally decent guy was spot on, and such a lovely departure from the brutality of Tony Soprano. For those of us who had watched his career, we knew he was capable of more (see his sensitive enforcer in ""Get Shorty,""), but despaired of him being typecast as a heavy. Those morose reflections aside, this is a funny and honest film. Some of the honesty is wince inducing, especially when showing the stupid things we do to keep from being hurt or compromised in a new relationship. Ms. Louis-Dreyfuss for the most part did a good job, but a few times the character seemed to verge on a slightly saner version of Elaine from Seinfield. Still, it was a good character piece, a rom-com for the romantically jaded, middle-aged person with both kids and baggage. Well worth your time.",Enough Said
89,cinemaniac2002,"Brilliant writing, directing, acting",10,8 June 2014,"I am a big fan of director Nicole Holofcener's work, as well as actors James Gandolfini, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Catherine Keener and Toni Collette - but I put off seeing this film as it came out right on the heels of James Gandolfini's death. I did not know him, but know people who did - so it felt ""too soon"" to see it. I knew I would see it one day - and that day finally came last night. ""Enough Said"" is one of those films I knew I would like; after seeing so many movies - you kind of know when something is going to be worth watching. In this case, the body of work of the director and players really speaks for itself, so I was confident that I would enjoy this film. What I didn't know, however, was just how much.While billed as a ""romantic comedy,"" this film is far more than that. It is an exploration into middle aged life; the maturity that goes along with having ""been there, done that,"" but it also contains a great deal of wry humor that only can come from that experience. Thus, the film richly details the lives of two people who clearly have their own personal priorities - though the film doesn't concentrate much on them. Instead, the story focuses upon how these two interact with both those around them, as well as themselves.This film is also written sans the obnoxious, in your face humor that seems so prevalent in today's American film comedies - which is one of the reasons it is so charming and smart. However, Ms. Holofcener demonstrates how acutely aware of the (often lack of ) manners and morals of the self-involved middle class of the West Coast. For instance, the attention paid to the various vanities and hypocritical antics of the characters exemplifies how their privileged existence defines their apathetic complacency, as well as passive aggression. And yet, it is easy to still care about all of them, because they are not so ridiculously written as to be entirely mean spirited.The brilliant Julie Louis-Dreyfus approaches the Eva character as a real woman, who is a caring mother on a journey of self-discovery and a new life that is to begin as her daughter goes off to college - something that she has in common with James Gandolfini's Albert - also a parent on the brink of empty next syndrome. Eva faces various emotional challenges throughout the film, many of which are pure comic genius, without being over the top.Unlike most other movies I see, I did not want this movie to end. I wanted to see how these characters continued on with their lives - ever hopeful that love would develop and prevail.Part of the irony of this film is that it is James Gandolfini's last and that one gets the feeling that this role - unlike the many others he has played to perfection - is more like him than any other. In this film, he was able to show the softest side of himself that few would have otherwise ever seen. Acquaintances I have who know him has described him as very caring and playful, delving into intensity when necessary to ""get to where he needed to go"" (as he himself said on ""Inside the Actors Studio""). Of course, this all speaks to his innate, natural acting ability - a remarkable gift that was never lost on him - though his friends and family, as well as the public will surely feel the loss.",Enough Said

It's a pleasant enough way to spend the afternoon but you won't remember this film in ten years' time. It is the story of an early forties woman Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus from Seinfeld) who falls in love with the much bigger much less attractive Albert (James Gandolfini from the Sopranos in one of his last ever roles). Despite the fact that Albert suffers from self-confidence issues, he is warm, funny and very easy to love. Eva is not sure and it is fun watching her fall in love with him anyway. It is an unremarkable story with scenes that so far from the dazzle of Hollywood and so ordinary that you feel like the characters are just friends of yours and you are simply watching two friends fall in love. There are some interesting subplots as well. It's a unique feeling watching things on screen that you see in very day life and I did enjoys this movie.

92,TimMeade,Enjoyable Middle Aged Rom-Com,8,14 November 2013,"Enough Said is the latest occasional cinema offering from writer and director Nicole Holofcener whose mainly television credits include Six Feet Under and the witty Parks and Recreation.It is a middle-aged rom-com centering on a budding relationship between two fifty-something divorcees Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and Albert (James Gandolfini). Eva, an unfulfilled masseuse finds a common bond with the overweight and slightly slob-prone Albert, a television librarian. Both are struggling with the realisation that their respective daughters are soon to leave home and State as they go off to further education. Eva shares her experiences and details of her incipient romance with a coterie of friends, the therapist Sarah (Toni Collette) and successful poet Marianne (Catherine Keeler).The film's comedy though pretty firmly rooted in safe, white bread territory is nonetheless both funny and nicely played. There are some very enjoyable set pieces and the dialogue between all the protagonists flows nicely – the characters are well drawn. There is distinct chemistry between Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini, in his penultimate screen performance. Eva's slightly down-trodden persona matches nicely with Albert whose perceptive nous is perhaps under-rated by those who judge him on his physical appearance.The twist, when it comes, relies on a previously latent and unknown familial relationship – a fairly common device for a rom-com. But, unlike the similar twist in Crazy, Stupid Love this one is both believable and within the flow of the film's story.The film's main strength lies in the high quality of acting from the two romantic leads who are ably and well supported by Catherine Keeler and particularly Toni Collette. Gandolfini is given the strongest role by Holofcener – a wise decision, giving the film better balance with he being the only non-peripheral man in the piece.The main criticism to be made is of the sub-standard editing which jars several times and is distinctly off-putting. The musical score is nothing to write home about either. But both these minuses need to be put into the context of an amiable and pleasant film which, whilst not delivering anything new, is well paced and engaging – it has no pretensions to be avant garde. It knows its niche and sticks to it.Last year, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel defied the mainstream critics and became a success as it found an audience who enjoyed the sight of people far from the first flush of youth who had not given up on love or the idea of sex. I believe Enough Said might enjoy support from a similar audience. It deserves it.",Enough Said

After the movie ended, I watched the theater empty and I am pretty sure I was the youngest viewer in the theater, and I am 40.In my unqualified opinion, the best praise that I can heap upon it is that it as as funny as a funny American movie (As good as it gets), and as thoughtful, real, cute and hyperbole free and full of memorable characters as a French movie, where KISMET plays a big role (Amelie, Happenstance, etc)!It is not truly intended to be a comedy movie, where they try and set up comedic scenes and load it with over the top characters, yet the parade of jokes was endless, usually courtesy of back and forth banter between the two lead characters. Everything about this movie felt real and even though I don't know if some tangible benefit can be gained, but simply the thoughtfulness regarding how people react to each other and feel things differently can help everyone.There is lot to feel in this movie as well, parent's anguish over children moving out, couples' disappointment in failed relationships, wondering about what it could have been, how couples who are able to make it work react to each other, etc. Which is why I wished more young people or any young people could discover this movie, as they would understand their parents better courtesy of this movie.Finally, a sweet romantic thoughtful comedy would no be so joyous, had it ended on a negative note.

Written and directed by Nicole HolofcenerSometimes a movie will follow you wherever you go. At work as I'm cleaning up, James Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfuss sitting on their porch would peer upon me. As I was on the plane travelling to the labyrinthine Big Easy, I wanted to rid myself of this movie's desire to inflict itself on my eyes. So how was it, you ask?It was a light, breezy film. The dialogue flows off of their tongues and the chemistry that James Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfuss have is extraordinary. They just seem like they are naturally made for each other. They seem like such an odd pairing at first and the movie addresses this. They have their quirks and their past which plays an integral part to the story. Eva(Julia Louis Dreyfuss) meets Albert's ex wife at a party mere moments before she meets Albert(James Gandolfini). Eva is a masseuse and she takes on the ex wife as a client and they quickly become good friends. While the problem with this is that the ex wife complains to her friend about her ex husband. She doesn't know they're dating and Eva doesn't want to ruin this friendship. It is quite the dilemma.It feels like a real relationship. You like this people. You want to see them succeed at happiness. They are lonely and their children are about to leave the house for college. The empty nest syndrome is strong in this regard. They are hitched to their children and their jobs. But they need adult companionship in life. They find it in each other. They find that but it's held together by a little bit of deception. This deception begins to poison what they have.Eva latches onto the negative aspects his ex-wife tells her. She begins to see these things as irritants because her friend saw them as annoyances. They were not things that bothered her before.This was a really sweet film. You want them to succeed in their careers and in their love with each other. I give this movie a B.",Enough Said

Here she has given Julia Louis-Dreyfus that role, with excellent results. She has written a sympathetic character, who feels insecure in her own judgments, always seeking input on even the most trivial matters from women (and girls) whose judgment she values more highly than her own; we as the audience get to watch the results as they happen, which is kind of like watching a very slow velocity train wreck, and is pleasantly excruciating.

98,motezart,"Great acting, stupid movie",5,13 October 2013,"I went to see this film for two reasons, because it got great reviews and because of James Gandolfini. Unfortunately, the reviews were wrong. Great performances by Dreyfus and Gandolfini are forced to cohabitate with a terrible, mundane plot. This makes it impossible to feel sympathy for the characters or their lives. It seems as if the characters are purposely depicted in a way as to evoke pity. This is enraging because these characters are not pathetic in the least. I tried really really hard to empathize with the them, but it was impossible. They are just not realistic and therefore impossible to care about.Julia Louis Dreyfus' uninteresting character egomaniacally brings on all her own misfortunes. We see her make bad choice after bad choice. It is no wonder that she ruins all her personal relationships. She's an idiot! But Dreyfus' acting is fantastic. What a paradox!The most enraging thing is that this film was advertised as a humorous drama. I left the theater post-film, fuming at being misled. I felt I'd had been taken like a sucker into thinking this was some kind of quirky little indie film, something Squid and the Whale-ish (even though I don't like Squid, I like that genre). I would have accepted the film more openly had it at least been a romantic comedy, but Enough Said is a full-on romance. It has some hilarious parts, but they are single handedly the result of Dreyfus' spectacular performance.This film snubs us unlucky people by declaring that it is in fact our own fault that are we live screwed up lives. But we unlucky people don't want to be told it's our fault. We like to blame the world for our problems, and we like to see charters on the screen that fall from grace not because they fly to close to the sun, but because the sun explodes and engulfs them in flames.I can name on one hand the romances stories I like, so perhaps by not being part of this film's target audiences I am negatively biased. Whatever it was the film's producers were trying to evoke in me, they failed at it.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",Enough Said

I'm sure there are many more purported 'real life in LA' movies.Do I care about any of these people and their lives and dilemmas? Are their lives and personalities and goals and efforts anything like the many people I know where I live? Most people I know are involved in the arts or music or progressive community activism or families, and sometimes even churches.Frankly, the world of The Simpsons and Family Guy (and even South Park) are closer to any reality than most of these movies. People (like Catherine Keener) who make a living writing poetry and are ""best friends"" with rock stars?--Get real! Wish-fulfillment sex with the hottest girl or guy in high school and then somebody learns a life lesson, or (alternatively) hilarity ensues! Yeah right--just like my everyday life, eh? The best depictions of real life in LA (and I do have many friends who live there) is maybe the writings of Charles Bukowski. In films, I'd say Steve Martin's LA STORY--a great and funny film about ""real life"" there in 'lala land"".I felt let down by ENOUGH SAID--the characters weren't real enough and the plot was too artificial and contrived for me. --A massage artist who ends up in a huge metro area with her boyfriend's ex-wife for a customer? --coincidences like that are a plot cliché older than Shakespeare. Maybe in a small town, but in LA?--seems kind of unlikely to me.And then at the end everybody has to ""learn a lesson about life and acceptance"" and become improved people.""--Yeah right.

I simply loved this movie. I didn't hear much about it before it came out, and honestly when I saw the poster last week I wasn't that interested (I know, a bad way to decide whether to watch a movie or not)! I read some of the reviews on IMDb and found out that the writer and director was Nicole Holofcener who also did Lovely and Amazing and Please Give, both of which I really enjoyed. I then also saw that she directed some episodes of Six Feet Under, Sex and the City, and Gilmore Girls all of which I love! Anyway, I went in with high expectations, but I have to say I was blown away. This movie was smart, funny, touching, and a bit sad at moments. The acting and chemistry (although sometimes awkward) was great between Dreyfus and Gandolfini. I believe this is Holofcener's masterpiece, and this was a true blessing that this was Gandolfini's (unknowingly) last role that he would ever play. We saw a different side of him through his character and he was superb. Dreyfus, as always, was funny and right on point. I loved these characters and the plot of this story. I don't know if the actors actually read these reviews, but I hope they do. This film was a true gem in a time when quality movies are hard to come by.I hope you all take a chance on this movie and I hope you love it as much as I do!",Enough Said

I was not disappointed at all. I thought it felt like a very ""real"" film, and those who have commented that they found it to be too much from the female perspective need to get a clue. I'm sorry, but women really do talk about their ex-husbands/husbands/boyfriends, so I didn't find the premise of this too far-fetched. The only thing that is pretty unlikely is that in a city as large as Los Angeles, the women would happen to be talking about the same man. But, hey, I live in San Diego -- the sixth largest city in the country, and I can't believe how often I run into people I know.I think if you want to see a nicely done, intelligent romantic comedy for the slightly older crowd, this is your movie -- and at an hour and a half, just the right length so as not to wear out its welcome. My husband commented as we were exiting the theater that he was really glad a small film like this can still get made -- they are few and far between, it seems. The only thing I would change was the soundtrack -- the edgy, stupid sounding crap that is omnipresent these days didn't seem to fit. But, hey, that's a small nit to pick.",Enough Said
103,hhg2,Agonizing for Non Lifetime Channel Fans,4,16 June 2014,"So many terrible characters, so much time to wallow. There are films where the protagonist is a flawed, but basically good person, so that we can appreciate their journey, whatever it might be. Not so here. Eva (Julia Louis- Dreyfuss) is a confused and bitter divorcée with a daughter to raise. That she is a good and caring mother is her only virtue. Generally she is shallow, entitled, and almost everything a massage therapist is not supposed to be: positive, supporting, and joyous. Most of her clients, as seen through vignettes, are either self-absorbed, non courteous, or are halitosis-challenged.The story follows the web of conceit and duplicity of Eva as she inadvertently finds two new people to add to her inner circle: a new client (and friend) and love a interest. The twist: both were once married to each other, yet she tries to keep the secret from both of them, out of fear, insecurity, and general horrible judgment. The tension builds as her web collapses on her. The problem for me was that most of her supporting friends are vapid caricatures and largely unpleasant. I hate to use the sledgehammer term ""chick flick,"" but unless you are interested in this type of pseudo-sophisticated dysfunction, you will be clamoring for the theater exit or the ""off"" button on the remote.So, why four stars? Both main characters were well-played but given rough story lines to deal with. I was interested in James Gandolfini's role. We all know him from his gangster or ""heavy"" type of roles, and I found it endearing to watch him play a much softer role with such aplomb.",Enough Said

You fail to understand how could you have been so crazy about such a boring, charmless person. Guess you are not alone. Actually nothing really changed about this person and neither much changed about you. It's just time and with time you start paying attention to details and devil stays in the details.

During all the relationship stuff the movie still ties in the daughters and their teenage attitudes, their married friends and their issues.

The characters are real: flawed, struggling with self-esteem, likable, human. The script is well written. I have never been a Julia Louis-Dreyfus fan, but her expressions and awkwardness and painful mistakes as Eva are embarrassingly real. James Gandolfini is both vulnerable and tough enough that he's not going to be walked over. This role in particular underscores the loss to all of us of such a multi-faceted actor. I thought Catherine Keener was good, though I find that she tends to play all her roles the same way. Toni Collette, besides being one of my favorite actors, is perfect in her role as a ""must rearrange the house because I can't sit still with my life"" woman. But it's the script that gives the actors the tool for their wonderful performances. It's tight, and realistic and not the least bit melodramatic. The three girls: Tess, Chloe and Ellen are all wonderful. Tess, because we can see immediately the insecurity beneath her arrogance, Chloe because of her borderline inappropriate neediness, and Ellen because of her simmering anger at her mother for almost replacing her before she had packed for college. Because of the nuanced performances, this is a move I will watch again.",Enough Said

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a divorcée working as a massage therapist and getting ready to send her daughter off from California to Sarah Lawrence College. At a party she meets two people, a man she starts dating (played by the late James Gandolfini) and a poet who becomes her client and her friend (Holofcener regular Catherine Keener). To say more would constitute a spoiler, but nothing seems contrived or manipulative. It's the dialogue, hilarious and touching by turns, and the superb acting that sell the story. Holofcener is an immense talent as both writer and director, and Louis-Dreyfus is marvelous in the lead.

It is also about perspectives and pettiness, which in the absence of grander scheme of things, take hold of our lives.The performances are top-notch.

There were no big plot twists save one, and the lack of the film's complication made it highly palatable. No art school new wave film here, that's for certain.And yet, the movie reeks of charm, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus countering the late James Galdolfini for lead character. Julia's character meets James's character at a party, where Julia also meets James's ex-wife, a well-established poet who she takes on as a massage client. She does not know until very far into her highly gossip-driven massages of this ex-wife that the ex-husband her client gripes about constantly is Gandolfini's character, who Julia L-D has started seriously dating. Instead of coming clean to both her client and her significant other, she chooses to preserve the seeming peace that listening to her client's highly negative gossip while sleeping with her client's ex-husband on the side provides. This proves to be a mistake, and everyone involved gets a little hurt in the end. The couple puts distance between themselves; meanwhile each of them is busy sending their now-adult daughters to their first semester of college. So there is a shared emotion of loss and adjustment, as well as a sincere interest in each other, that brings them back together.What I found interesting and a little unrealistic were the portrayals of relationships each adult character had with their exes. They were all able to sit together at a table for dinner, and there was shared interest in their growing children, general civility, and even concern of the exes for the new wives. In what universe do these non-talk-show-worthy interactions between divorcées occur?? The only relationship between exes that seems plausible to me is the one between Gandolfini's character and his ex, Julia's massage client: there is hostility, bitterness, defensiveness, and resentment, and all the things that tend to come with a divorce. Were it not for this dynamic amidst the quasi-sickening peace between ex husbands and ex wives, the film would not hold up under the microscope.As can be expected with JG and JLD, the film was incredibly well acted, and each one of them exudes a comfort and comedic confidence that makes the film's dialogues unfold organically. I have always respected Jim Gandolfini, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is one of the funniest women on screen today, and has been since the 90s when she played Elaine on Seinfeld. An interesting side-note: I notice that Julia tends to always drive a prius in her recent work, particularly on this film and in her former sitcom The New Adventures of Old Christine. She clearly endorses this product or else there is a huge coincidence.Pick this film up if you want something lightweight, sharp, simple, and touching, but like I said, don't expect any hidden subtext.",Enough Said

There is no rough tinted humor, it is not the target of the movie, but rather a subtle humor so close to reality and recognizable in some real world situations. The story is a bit special due to the relations of Eva with the ex-wife of her boy friend and that brings us some awkward moments. In fact, these situations are quiet good treated and brings some debt in the story for those who give it a thought. We have some heartfelt situations between people who are on the same wavelength, but not body attracted, providing sweet and mellow feelings.

I admired how he depicted his vulnerability and limitations so openly and honestly without trying to be anyone else or emulate anyone else. Truly unique and uncompromising in his own right. I never warmed up to his Tony Soprano character but he was an absolute gem in this one. Julia Dreyfus just moved to the top of my awesome actors list. She shows her frailties and limitations and potential for human expansion in such a beautiful way. I hope she gets an award for this. The story is around her seemingly mundane life wanting more and looking for love but in a real way. She is willing to explore all her shadow parts of herself without sparing others in the process.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus's character is really not likable at all, not to say plain annoying.At first, it looks like the story is about the insecurity many people deal with after a divorce and the reluctance to start a new relationship, which seems to affect the main character, Eva, as well. The man she falls in love with is no prince charming in the classical sense. So far, so good. But then another story line is added, about prince-not-so-charming's ex-wife who becomes friends with Eva and does nothing but talk nasty about him, which results in a lot of lying and stupidity, almost as if Eva wants to mess it up.

There were maybe three lines of dialogue in this movie which could be classed as mildly humorous, and ditto for the 'drama' content.

126,aglowery,Disappointing,6,19 October 2013,"It's a shame that Enough Said's status as a posthumous movie will reel in certain audiences who wouldn't normally go for its female-centric genre. James Gandolfini's premature death will invite fans of The Sopranos but guys, this is a chic-flick and although it's refreshing to see Gandolfini bear a different kind of role, his turn as a sluggish and overweight single parent is far from meeting the supremacy of Tony Soprano.Enough Said is the new romantic comedy from writer/director Nicole Holofcener (Friends With Money, Six Feet Under). It tells the story of Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a masseuse and single parent as she steps cautiously into a relationship with Albert (Gandolfini). On the same night as she encounters her new companion, Eva also acquires a new client Marianne (Catherine Keener) who, during their sessions, does little besides complain about her pathetic loser of an ex- husbandYes, you got it. Before long, Eva works out that she is in fact talking about Albert.As harsh as it may sound, given the escapism element of cinema, it's quite easy to overlook the fact that an actor has passed and to just savour the performance as being their last. Sadly, this is not the case here. The late Gandolfini appears weighty and unhealthy, but the ""comedy"" goes out of its way to ridicule the size of the screen legend. Jokes about calorie books and being squashed during acts of intimacy offer constant reminders that the superlative Soprano is gone; needless to say, this infringes on what should have been a sincere experience.Enough Said follows the conventional Hollywood mode of storytelling and in that vein, renders itself predictable. It claims to be a comedy and its plot loosely mimics that of Bridesmaids in where the emotionally unstable female breaks the gentle guy's heart, right before she realises her own shallowness. Given its half-hearted attempt to rework the narrative of Paul Feig's hit female-Hangover, it's almost as if Holofcener fed her cat the script to Bridesmaids, waited for the fur ball to be coughed-up and then slapped her own title to it. Where Holofcener's reputation sees to it that she makes movies that are easy to slip into, there's something awkward at the heart of this portrait of middle-aged relationships that prevents it from growing as a successful rom-com.Louis-Dreyfus is comically able and a radiant centrepiece. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense) and Catherine Keener (The 40 Year Old Virgin) are also amongst the rich acting talent that help keep this potholed script afloat. The last word is reserved for the great Gandolfini whose dedicated performance as a character far from his comfort zone sees the perfect way to round off his illustrious legacy.For Jim.

127,buzzbruin-650-409183,A warm wonderful film,10,30 September 2013,"Another reason to thank independent filmmakers. After seeing Prisoner I felt I needed an antidote to its poison. Here is a great film which proves beyond any doubt that great drama can come from ordinary working-class people. It also shows that our movie culture is still surviving the awfulness of mass audience films. The loss of Mr. Gandolfini is very sad. His acting style, his genuine persona, his warmth and his utter lack of fake acting are to be missed. Imagine a man beloved even though he is a murdering thug (in the sopranos) gives one some idea of his genuine talent. The film also dealt with the sometimes hatred of divorced people and men and women. But in a super-intelligent way, theses issues were dealt with seeped in reality and honest truth. The writer is a genius as proved by other films of hers that I have seen. Finally Hollywood needs more women in the industry behind the camera and as writers and Directors. (DUH!) All of my hatred of Prisoners was washed clean by this beautiful sensitive movie.",Enough Said
128,vixstein,This was a comedy?,4,15 April 2021,"I watched this because it had a fantastic cast and I wanted to see an actual adult love story. But...it was the same tired story we've seen a million times before. Couple gets together, misunderstanding happens, couple gets back together-ish. The characters behaved in a way no nobody ever would and really weren't relatable. There was no character development at all. Amazing cast though and they did the best they could with what they were given.",Enough Said
129,C_pa_cool,One of the best rom-com of 2013,8,15 June 2014,"I watched Enough Said expecting a casual rom-com, a feel-good movie like we've already seen thousands of; but oh god was I wrong, it is much more than that!The story focuses on two late 40's, early 50's characters and that's what makes the difference. Just like Nancy Meyer's It's Complicated, these characters have kids, already been married and are just trying to prove that love life doesn't stop after 50. There too few movies which show 50 something adults struggling with love and life in general. I find it very refreshing.Enough Said is a very charming movie. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a fantastic actress when it comes to comedy, her sarcastic personality is very funny to watch and she shows lots of vulnerability which makes you identify with the character of Eva, even if you're not over 40 or divorced. James Gandolfini shows a totally different facet of what we are used to see in The Sopranos, he shows here a very soft and fluffy side of him. He was a tremendous actor, never doing too much, and he is greatly missed. The supporting actors brings the story even more colorful touches and they are all perfect in there own role.All in all, Enough Said is a very enjoyable comedy, highly recommended. Very refreshing, for the ones who are getting tired of the early 30 something girl looking for love in NYC.",Enough Said
130,MorgothsReach,A Solid and Satisfying Send Off to the Great James Gandolfini,7,30 October 2013,"The late and great James Gandolfini will always be Tony Soprano. No doubt about that. Although he never garnered the kind of roles and acclaim that he undoubtedly deserved on the big screen, he will forever be remembered in the halls of TV history for his iconic and powerful portrayal of the troubled mobster. Following Gandolfini's tragic and untimely death in Rome earlier this year, the most that fans could look forward to were the final films he had been working on. One such film is Enough Said, the story of a divorcée's relationship with the ex-husband of one of her massage clients and the obvious, resultant complications arising from this. The good news is that the great actor's final screen performance is, deservedly, an appropriate farewell. Eva (Julia Louis- Dreyfus) is a single divorcée of ten years about to watch her daughter go off to college. With no romantic social life to speak of Eva whiles away her time as a masseuse, forced to persevere with the bad breaths and incessant chattering of her clients. At a party, however, Eva meets Albert (Gandolfini) and though mutually agreeing that they aren't attractive to anyone there, something seems to click between the two. Things only get better as they begin dating with Eva succumbing to Albert's charms even though, as she repeatedly remarks, she was initially put off by his overweight appearance. There is only one problem. And quite a big one at that. At the same party where she met Albert, Eva bonded with Marianne (Catherine Keener), a divorcée like herself, who decides to enlist the assistance of Eva's massage skills. If you didn't see it coming, or if you haven't seen the numerous trailers which give it away, it transpires that Marianne is actually Albert's ex-wife! As Marianne continually disparages Albert during their massage sessions, Eva increasingly finds herself torn between her own affection for the new man in her life and the character she is building in her mind through her client's appraisals. Enough Said is a nice, pleasant indie rom-com which won't get you thinking much after the ending. It is helped by the great performances and on-screen chemistry of its leads as well as from a sharp and witty script. Director, Nicole Holofcener, also deserves credit for giving Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus plenty of time during scenes to assert themselves as their characters, making it hard not to crack a smile during many of their exchanges. Dreyfuss is great as the funny and intelligent Eva who jeopardises her relationship through an all too willing ear and her own insecurities. The film feels like it is missing something however whenever Gandolfini is off-screen. It is hard not to associate the large, bear-like frame with the patriarch of the Soprano family but Gandolfini proves why he was chosen not only to play a mafia don but also a therapy-driven man struggling with his overpowering emotions. Combining wit and charm, Gandolfini brings an added sensitivity to the good-at-heart but slovenly and overweight Albert who expresses only confusion and sadness when he discovers the truth behind Eva's misgivings. It is a subtle performance truly worthy of one of the actor's final films. Additional, good support is provided by indie regulars, Toni Collete as Eva's friend and Catherine Keener. While some scenes may feel repetitive like the numerous comedic moments squeezed from the issue of Albert's weight, and the inevitable complications arising from it, this is still an enjoyable, light hearted film which is a satisfactory send off to the great life and career of James Gandolfini. https://sites.google.com/site/drunkprojectionist/",Enough Said
131,divinemsh,Most realistic dialog I've heard in ages,8,9 December 2013,"I saw this movie this past weekend, when it FINALLY made it to a local theater. The fact that I found a lot of kinship with Julia Louis Dreyfus' character helped push it up a notch or two. Like her character, I'm a divorcée, and my only child, a boy, went off to college this past August. Fortunately, I'm not as needy, and would never think of inviting one of his (younger) friends to live with me after he went off to school. :-) All in all, very realistic dialog (it's not easy dating in your 40s/50s), and I think this captured an empty-nester's mindset very well. Great acting by all, but James Galdofini's performance as Albert was charming and bittersweet.",Enough Said
132,khorasanimgn,It cant be my favourite,4,29 June 2019,"Enough said is a 2013 American drama movie written and directed by Nicole Holofcener and stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Eva and James Gandolfini as Albert. Eva is a divorced masseuse who takes part in a party with her friends and meets a funny man (Albert) who is not physically attractive at all. However, they go on a date which goes pretty well and they start a relationship. Then, Eva figures out that Albert's ex-wife is one of her clients and friends.Therefor, this fact causes some complications in their relationship.The movie is an entertaining one which presents a comedy story about dating in middle age after divorce and difficulties that the couples may face. It can also be about making some mistakes that are impossible to make up and hurting people you love.The actors presented great performances and Gandolfini was wonderful in his role as a clumsy and carefree man. Also, Dreyfus was completely believable in her role as a compassionate mother who is terrified by the thought of her daughter's departure and loneliness.Nevertheless, the film, irrespective of presenting an adult romantic comedy, their solitary, their need and fears which are wise concepts, contain nothing new and as soon as I started watching the film, I felt I had watched the same story before since the plot was totally similar to many romantic dram movies that a couple starts a picture- perfect relationship, copes with some difficulties in the middle and almost breaks up and finally in the last moments of the film, they renew their relationship.Although, the film can not be one of my favorites, it is definitely worth watching once as it propounds a new idea.",Enough Said
133,eamonnshadokarafferty,Just not for me,4,14 April 2014,"Eva is a divorced masseuse. When she attends a evening event with friends, she meets poet Marianne who ends u hiring her for her skills and her friend Will introduces her to Albert. The two of them hit it off for having similar senses of humour.While Eva begins dating Albert, when she starts taking Marianne on as her client, she begins to learn annoying details of her ex husband, which she connects together that Albert is the ex.Well the overall plot is simple, Eva meets Albert, starting seeing Albert, all the while she meets Marianne, Marianne becomes her client and she starts bad mouthing A lot about her ex husband, eventually Eva connects the two together and tries to keep the relationships intact. The problem I have, and maybe it's still a realistic portrayal, is that Eva listens to every word Marianne has to say about Albert as gospel which takes the second half of the film to generic road once Eva realises that Albert is the ex husband.I like the actors in the cast here and for a romantic drama spin, it's nice and different for a change that we're focusing on the flaws of the female characters in this, from Eva using the words of a judgemental ex- wife and eats it up to make her own judgements of Albert to using her daughter friend to fill the void of her daughter leaving for college. Eva is needy and shallow throughout the film and particularly comes into play at the dinner scene with Albert, Will and Sarah. Julia tries her best in the role of Eva but I didn't particularly like the character, Toni Colette is underused in her role as Sarah but I do enjoy the sort of comedy value her and Ben Falcone's Will in the bickering between the two. Catherine Keener literally plays the role like she could've done it in her sleep as you think it would be a big role, considering the connection to the characters, but once the reveal is out in the open she just disappears. James Gandolfini is the only person in this that you can at least root for in this film and is a kind character.Some nice performances, in particular from James Gandolfini, but for the exception of Gandolfini's character Albert, I didn't like any of the rest and the story, for me personally, I found boring. Maybe if I come back to it in a decades time I might appreciate it more, but for now I don't feel like I'm missing much.",Enough Said
134,arbyuu,"good script, sabotaged by a huge casting misstep...",1,2 January 2014,"This movie had potential. A good and credible storyline, and a fine performance by the late James Gandolfini. In a story about two wounded, lonely hearts who find connection, Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a disaster in the role of a somewhat awkward middle-aged woman who has been hurt before, but who is willing to risk hurt and rejection for the chance of new romance. Louis-Dreyfus corrupts her character into a needy, unbalanced, self-absorbed nut-job (did I say unbalanced?). Instead of that warm romantic feeling we're supposed to have for these two, I found myself screaming at Albert (Gandolfini) to run like hell! The tragedy is that Gandolfini is well cast in his role and that he does an excellent job drawing us into his character. The movie is a bitter-sweet romantic drama, but Louis-Dreyfus plays it like an episode of Seinfeld. So sad that this was James Gandolfini's last movie. Enough Said, Indeed.",Enough Said
135,drewman-3,Excellent Film!!!,10,4 January 2014,"Sadly, the late great James Gandolfini's last work, however, certainly one of his best. His portrayal of Albert here is spot on. Very subtle but revealing look at the character's idiosyncratic life after divorce, and his somewhat insecure relationships with women.Julia Louis-Dreyfus really nails her character Eva too. A hard working mom, struggling with her daughter's departure for college, and desire for meaningful relationships. She tries too hard to please everyone, and it eventually comes back to hurt the main people in her life.Director and Writer Nicole Holofcener did an outstanding job as well. Realistic, efficient dialogue and camera work, with no wasted scenes. The lives of long term married couples and divorce is very accurately explored with this film.

137,ahalida132,A beautiful comedy full of liveliness!,7,6 December 2017,"What got my attention about this movie was firstly James Gandolfini – an actor whom I admire and respect. He passed away few years ago, but he left behind so many unforgettable characters and this film is a sweet note before his untimely death. His movies always touch my heart and one of the reasons I watch him acting is because of his great and rare talent. Now about this movie. It's very entertaining to watch. Rest assured that your time will not be wasted. You'll have a good laugh as the movie has very funny moments. Perhaps younger generation will avoid watching it, since it's more fit for older generation to watch. Many would say that this movie appeal to older crowd. The realistic conversations and situations will definitely hold your attention. The movie deals with a daily life of middle-aged people who have a lot in common i.e. kids who leave for college and both have gone through divorce. They meet at the party and by co- incidence the man she pursues to date turns out to be her new friend's ex-husband. I would address this movie to all people with different ages as this film will give you a better perspective of life in general. If you're tired of all this new fantasy, sci-fi, Hollywood action blockbusters, this is the movie for you! Actors completely lost themselves in their' roles. Acting was really great! Charming and sweet! This movie will stay in your memory for a long-term. The script and cast is so marvelous that you'll love every scene of it. I rate it 7/10.",Enough Said

I'm so fed up with always seeing men portrayed as A-holes so it'e s welcome change.In the movies people always have such well-defined careers and they're all home owners and doing quite well. They just have this 'relationship' issue and it's the only thing that isn't sorted out yet. Then they meet someone, fall in love, someone screws up big time, then there's forgiveness and all is well in the end. Real life just isn't like that. In real life, women make you feel like crap, then they move on to the next guy and they keep doing that until they end up with enough money that they don't ever have to actually do any work. I guess that wouldn't make for a very interesting movie though.",Enough Said

It was just a good, smart movie about life made by smart, caring people. We saw it at London Film Festival premier and also had a chance to participate in the chat with the director and Julia Louis Dreyfus. They are both funny and witty women and it seems like together they created a fun, meaningful movie, which was very pleasant to watch. Late James Gandolfini was also amazing in his role, a much different guy than his famous Tony Soprano portrayal. Very sad we lost this wonderful actor.

It's a romantic comedy in the sense that it's about two people who begin dating. But there's more heart and sentiment in it.Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Eva, a middle-aged divorcée. At the same time, she begins a friendship with a poet named Marianne, and begins dating Albert, a burly man, also divorced. But the twist is that he's the ex-husband of Eva's new best friend.The movie was released after the death of James Gandolfini, who plays Albert. Gandolfini was so good; his character had a bear-like essence, but was still a sensitive guy. The fact that the movie is s so good and so funny makes it hard to watch all because Gandolfini rarely ever played a character like that and we'll never see a performance like that again.It's funny, it has heart, it's a sweet movie, and it's not like any sappy romantic comedy ever made.

This movie was missing perhaps the most important element. If there isn't at least one character likable enough to make the watcher interested in finding out what happens to them, then what's the point of continuing watching.This movie not only didn't have a single stand out character, but it contained an endless series of painful emotional scenes, followed by a ho hum ending. The divorcée, who the movie centered around, behaved poorly consistently throughout the core of the movie. She possessed inadequate personal charm or redeeming characteristics to make the watcher want to forgive her poor choices.We watched it because of the ratings it received and a recommendation.When it finally, painfully, ended, we felt that we had more than wasted our time.Obviously, people who enjoy this sort of time filler are fundamentally different than us.",Enough Said

Both leads break from their typecasts and the chemistry between them is delightful. Louis-Dreyfus plays a warmer character than usual; less intelligent, less cynical, much more likable. Gandolfini's performance is amazing. Humble, sweet, gentle... Nothing like Tony Soprano. I always get a little sad watching this as it was released not long before his death. It's bittersweet though, because he left us this gem as a legacy. As Soprano he was infamous and legendary. Though likable at times, there was always the threat of violence present. As Albert, he shows us a more approachable side.OK, this has gone on too long. Basically: unlike every other romcom, this doesn't feel contrived or corny. Great cast, direction and script. The key to its success is that it doesn't put on airs. It doesn't try to be funny all the time. It's two real people falling in love.",Enough Said

It was way too pointless to be a drama but i suppose it may have been a weak romance.James Gandolfini does well portraying his part but that alone was not enough to make the story worthwhile. Unfortunately his character was the only character that I found interesting.The plot was weak but it was a romance story, I think, and I suppose it was hoped that this one could survive on very little else.

Jokes apart, I watched Enough Said on a Sunday evening on TV, and it took me just one scene between Albert and Eva to fall in love with it. For days following that evening, I watched every single video from the movie on YT and as if that wasn't enough, I ended up buying the DVD. And I haven't bought a DVD in, I don't know, six years maybe. What I like the most is the absence of unnecessary drama. The whole thing is so real, so natural. But the best part about the movie would be James G (bless him), and his portrayal of Albert. Through the course of the movie I remember saying out loud a lot of times that I wished I had a dad like Albert. Kind, sensitive, funny, loving, not to mention so cuddly.

A huge fan of hers, I think she is one of the most talented actress right now. And was I glad to see this movie. The movie is carried forward beautifully by its leading cast of Dreyfus and James Gandolfini who unfortunately had an untimely death. The supporting cast too was stellar. The chemistry between the couple felt natural. From the laughs to the awkwardness, it didn't feel like you were watching a movie but seeing it real before your eyes. The story is a simple one. A divorced lady falls in love with a divorced guy with whom she shares a good vibe. The problem being she is friends with the divorce guy's ex wife with whom she is getting along well only to later realize that she is his ex wife. There are few subplots involving the two daughters respectively although not a lot of attention was paid into it but still this is one of the most mature romantic films I have seen for a long time and it deserves the applaud its receiving.

There are no surprises, no twists, no adversary, no suspense. It's like watching your parents sit around and talk on a Sunday afternoon. They tell the same stories you've heard a hundred times and you sit there bored out of your mind, wishing you could escape.

Despite the obvious ending (well, maybe I just was more into an unhappy ending), the story flows in a very calm and enjoyable way. Middle-aged relationships with all the issues around them is a common theme but it came out as nice one. The funny scenes were pleasant and added something to the movie. As negative, maybe the ""mom and both daughters triangle"" could have been skipped because it didn't add much.

And my opinion of Dreyfus after watching this is that she just is not the caliber of actress to tackle dramatic film roles.Besides the lack of chemistry and Dreyfus being far outperformed by every other actor in the movie the script is just thin and silly. The premise is the equivalent of a half hour sit-com misunderstanding. Where if the main character had just done what any normal person in real life would have done there would be no movie.I found myself wondering if maybe Gandolfini had died during filming and so the script had to be rewritten to salvage a movie from what footage they had.

After seeing every episode of VEEP, and most of The Sopranos. I finally geared up to watch this film, on HBOgo. But, I failed to do so once again, always thinking I'd put it on when I couldn't decide what else to watch. Failed two times.
Now I did finally watch this film, this past week in fact, on a flight. This says nothing to the quality of the film, as it was among some amazing film choices. What does speak to the quality of the film is how engaged I was throughout, on a ten inch screen. The acting and casting in this film is impeccable, to say nothing of the script and direction. I found myself tearing up a few times in fact.
I won't bore you more with plot synopsis, except to say how refreshing it was to get a film about second romances, all the while losing the fantasy aspect of most romantic comedies. Having Julia Louis-Dreyfus assuming the ""male"" character I thought was genius. She and James have great chemistry that builds throughout the film.

Julia and James had excellent chemistry. The constant bickering among the couples was real and uncomfortable to watch (as it is in real life). Toni Collette and Catherine Keener were great too. And James...oh James...its just such a shame that we lost him before his time. He was so real, funny, lovable and self deprecating in this role. He was perfectly cast and I could have seen him going on to star in many leading comedy roles. I'm sure this kind of movie won't do well in the theater (no action, killing or blood), but hopefully people will see it on DVD. Well worth it.",Enough Said

I think the whole scenario didn't make a real point in the end, and without giving spoilers, I think it really shows how USELESS and bad behavior doesn't get punished in the end. In short, the scenario takes you on a boring ride and at the end, I didn't get what I was hoping for, no in fact it all comes down to the beginning again. The filming was horrible. It was a standardized style which make the movie even more cold. And the absence of real locations bugged me. So to wrap this up, I was bored, I think the movie was Cold, it does not identify with real live, dialog do not contribute to the viewer his life or to the movie plot etc.So why three. Gandolfini! For me he really brings some warmth in the film and tries to his best. His acting performance was good. Although I don't understand why he signed for this script anyway. Because I will repeat myself, this was one of the most boring movies I watched in a long time. Because I couldn't even laugh with it at the point it lost my interest.",Enough Said
157,richardwhelan17,"""Enough Said"", witty, wonderful and grown-up!",9,29 September 2013,"When I see a film and are still thinking about the characters the next day, I know I liked it.""Enough Said"" is one of those films..A quality script that the all star cast brings to the highest level. The dialogue is so subtle, intimate and at times evasive that I could easily see the work on a stage. It has a modern day Pinteresque quality to it! The bitter sweet note is that as James Gandolfinos' last role, before his untimely death, it is his best. It seems like he was just starting to feel his potential as a diverse actor and ""Albert"" is a character we have never seen him in. Julia Louis- Dreyfus continues to amaze us with her portrayal of ""Eva"", a California single mom masseuse. I have always enjoyed her work especially in ""Veep"" but I think we will be delightfully surprised in the future with the range of characters she creates. Catherine Keener and Toni Collette who I would watch and listen to read a phone book, round out the cast. Go see it if you are in the mood for a ""grown-up"" film. Enjoy!",Enough Said
158,dandtw1964,Enough Said Aptly Titled,4,5 October 2013,"In ""Enough Said"" we meet Eva...a divorced, needy, aimless and apparently frustrated middle-aged masseuse. She spends her days performing a job which brings her little joy while simultaneously parenting her college-bound daughter, Ellen (Tracy Faraway). At a dinner party, where she plays the role of third wheel for another couple, she meets a new client, Marianne. Marianne, played by a sleep-walking Catherine Keener, is a famous yet isolated poet who needs a new friend. Eva is happy to oblige. Meanwhile, at the same party Eva is introduced to Alfred who will become her love interest. Like her, Alfred is lonely and has an ex-wife and a college-bound daughter in tow. Unlike her, he is slightly more fulfilled in his job as a classic television program restorer and cataloguer. Cue the hilarity.Okay...NOT! Billed as a smart ""romcom"" for adults, Enough Said is at best a ""rom-drama."" Now, this isn't to say that there aren't moments of humor. There are. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an expressive face which serves up several chuckles in the first half of the film. However, once the oh so predictable plot twist finally occurs...and keeps twisting for the remainder of the movie!...humor is cast aside. Instead, it becomes a squirm-inducing marathon as the audience watches Eva mismanage every relationship in her life.Meanwhile, along the way we meet other characters who are part of way too many sub-plots. Eva's best friend Sarah (well played by Toni Collette) is a therapist who at home is locked in a tug-of-war with her husband over whether or not to fire their maid; Ellen's friend Chloe (Tavi Gevinson)is misunderstood by her own mother, so Eva steps in to fill the gap; and Alfred's daughter Tess (Eve Hewson)is alternately snotty and sympathetic. Confused? I was too. By the time Enough Said ended, never have I been more surprised when I looked at my watch. With everything going on this movie, I'd though it'd been much longer than its 1 hour 33 minute run time.Now, ""Enough Said"" isn't without some commendation. For his part, James Gandolfini...in what was sadly his last role...did an admirable job with his character. Alfred is sweet, patient and clumsily kind. We can't help but root for him. The same can be said for Sarah's husband, Will, played by Ben Falcone. But unfortunately any bright spots that illumine this film are overshadowed by a darker than expected plot, poor editing and a plodding music score which only adds to it's general heaviness.In a moment of uncomfortable small talk during the film's opening dinner party scene, Eva blurts out ""only ugly people here."" This sentence foreshadows what comes after it, 1 1/2 hours of ugly behavior and blurred relationship boundaries. Combine that with the aforementioned editing problems and a bleak musical score, and what we have is simply a mess. Enough Said.",Enough Said
159,redcoolchilly,Cant get enough of Enough said,10,25 February 2014,"Simply effortless portray of immaculate acting by both the leads. The story line is not out of this world , what makes it special is the pace with which the story proceeds.I happen to start watching this movie quarter to midnight expecting to collapse in an hour or so... but let me be honest here the characters grip you tight all the way long. The expressions ,the comic timings just put a bright smile on your face no matter what time of the day you are watching this.Strongly recommend this movie for a Sunday brunch watch.I am going with 10/10 with 9 for the acting and 1 for the story-line.The main leads steal the show all the way.",Enough Said
160,fbsta-anajr,funny and refreshing romance film to watch,8,16 June 2014,"If not for Julia Louis-Dreyfus, I would not have made plans to watch this film, but since I admire her performance in Veep so much, I decided to give this one a shot. I kinda liked how this wasn't over the top unlike other romcoms and still be able to keep me engaged for 90 minutes. I was smiling and laughing for most of the time. The film also has its touching moments which made me a bit of emotional (even teary- eyed). I liked it because it made the film balanced. Overall, I think I made the right decision to watch this film. It was nice, entertaining and refreshing for a romance film. I would definitely recommend it to people who want to have a good time. :D",Enough Said

162,danijela_vujovic,"pure, raw emotion...",10,3 August 2018,"Such an amazing movie, great story but what makes it so great is James Gandolfini and the way he made you feel about the storyline, the character he was playing... he made it all feel so real, and you just feel every emotion that the character is feeling. One of the best actors. Cried so much at the end because he has left us too soon. Rest in peace beautiful soul and thank you.",Enough Said
