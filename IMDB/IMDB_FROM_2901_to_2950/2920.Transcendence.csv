0,bkoganbing,Creating God and in our own image,8,30 August 2014,"Transcendence is one of those films that will really get the gray matter churning over its implications. Hard to believe but Johnny Depp the kid from Crybaby who later became Captain Jack Sparrow is now a scientist exploring creating artificial life that is not carbon based.Those Captain Jack Sparrow films bring in the money for the poke allowing Depp to essay an incredible array of parts. He can certainly add his role here to that list.Depp, his wife Rebecca Hall and best friend Paul Bettany are all researchers into computer science. They've got nothing less than the creation of self aware artificial intelligence as their goal. But there's a group of terrorists out there, not unlike extreme right to lifers who are so adamantly against this direction of science that they're killing all who are involved.Depp is wounded, but his wounds will prove fatal as they've been administered with bullets containing radium poisoning. Knowing his physical body is dying, Depp gets his mind transferred into the super computer of his design. He also has a holograph image projected mostly for his wife whom he still loves despite his existence in cyber space.After that Depp know just human intelligence in a computer starts doing some amazing things. People who are frightened easily want to bring the supercomputer of Depp down.Is this indeed the nature of God? A reasonable theory. Is what he does the nature of healing our environmentally wounded planet? Could be.Depp has a most difficult role to deal with, his character has been artificially enhanced so he's beyond human kind. But he still has some human feelings. Has in fact he made himself God and has dominion over all living things on planet earth.There was a film in the Seventies called Colossus The Forbin Project which also dealt with two super computers who take over dominion of life on earth. But those two didn't have the human face of Johnny Depp. Nor was the science sufficiently evolved.I think there was an inside joke here when Morgan Freeman was cast as a scientist. If you'll remember he played God in a film once himself.Transcendence is a fine film with credit going to its producers and star for bringing us a film that will be making you think weeks after seeing it.",Transcendence
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than expected...,6,28 October 2016,"I wasn't expecting to like TRANSCENDENCE very much, and that was based on the plot summary alone. Johnny Depp as a computer genius whose mind is uploaded into a computer? It sounds like an old-fashioned and predictable kind of story, one of those ones that require a huge suspension of disbelief and test the acting performances of those involved. Having just finished, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, which is no masterpiece but is pretty interesting and good in places.I'm not a fan of Depp and never have been, but you're not supposed to like his character here so that doesn't matter too much. The computer stuff is more interesting and the film incorporates some CGI effects work that was later borrowed for the villain in TERMINATOR GENISYS. Of course it all gets over the top and rather unbelievable, and that old cliché of fixing things with a computer virus is wheeled out once more (remember INDEPENDENCE DAY?).Still, I liked the direction and cinematography makes for a bright and colourful movie, better than the usual grey and dreary offerings. The supporting cast is excellent and includes Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Paul Bettany, Kate Mara, Cole Hauser, and Xander Berkeley. They're all fine if underutilised a bit. The one who stands out like a sore thumb is Rebecca Hall; nothing wrong with her acting, but her character is one of the dumbest ever which makes her a truly despicable protagonist. I don't mind characters acting ruthlessly or with moral ambiguity in films but when they act really dumb then I can't help but feel that it's the scriptwriter at fault.",Transcendence
2,SnoopyStyle,doesn't really work,5,29 January 2015,"Max Waters (Paul Bettany) lives in a world where electronics don't function anymore. Five years earlier, he is hoping to cure diseases with the help of Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) and his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) who are researching Artificial Intelligence. Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman) leads a government group in Livermore. Bree (Kate Mara) is part of an anti-technology terrorist group that launches simultaneous attacks on AI scientists. Joseph loses his team and Will is shot. FBI Agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) investigates the attacks and Will's PINN Project. Will is mortally wounded from radiation poisoning by the bullet. Evelyn convinces Max to help her download Will's brain into the PINN computer before he dies. Bree kidnaps Max to help her group take down Evelyn after she unleashed Will into the world.This movie works at times. Sometimes it almost works as a thriller. A lot of times, it kind of works as a horror movie. It's taking on a lot of big subjects and I really want it to be better. Coming into this with so many bad comments, I was initially pleasantly surprised by its watchability. It has some elements of horror in the middle but the movie struggles in the last act. It would also be great to find a lead to follow. Rebecca Hall would be the natural lead for a good horror movie. However the movie tries to be too much. It just doesn't really work.",Transcendence
3,Hitchcoc,Must We Accept the Science?,6,24 September 2014,"This is certainly a provocative movie. It deals with the idea of human emotion being combined with ""infallible"" scientific production. As soon as Johnny Depp's character gets inside the cyber-world, all that he is, his strengths, his weakness, his passions, his unending lust for knowledge become off the grid. How is it possible to have so much knowledge and not see yourself as the arbiter? As will possibly be the case--if we don't destroy ourselves some other way--there will be overseers who must view things from the fringe. It is not terribly different from the way we look at military or terrorist threats right now. The kicker here is the the Depp character is so far ahead of everyone, that it's as if his opponents are throwing sticks. What must ultimately happen is to appeal to the human side of Depp's Will Caster, because once the machine becomes too powerful and Caster loses his human connection, it is curtains for us poor idiots. This theme is handled reasonably well, but I just felt empty. I'm not doing spoilers, but the beginning of the movie pretty much derailed my interest.",Transcendence
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Interesting approaches, but finally too self-aware and scientific",4,16 September 2014,"This aims to be another ""Inception"", but clearly comes short. It is the first film of Christopher Nolan's Academy Award-winning cinematographer working as a director. ""Transcendence"" is written by Jack Paglen, who is also fairly new to the writing branch. This does not have to be bad as many writers can convince right away with their maiden project and frequently never reach that level again in later years. The big star here is obviously Johnny Depp. I wish it was the story though. Depp probably still has the talent to carry a film like this, but his recent works all seemed too self-aware and this one makes no difference. Here and there, you can actually find a moment of greatness during these two hours, but it is simply not enough. I did not see Depp becoming his character, I did see Johnny Depp acting, sadly.The film also has, away from the scientific science fiction aspect, far too many stereotypical scenes which became occasionally cringeworthy: Kate Mara as a blonde femme fatale in the pub having a drink would only be one of them. It was so bad it was almost funny. Pretty much everything that included her character was a weakness for the film. She is a young woman that leads an underground organization. She is the one with the gun in her hand that changes everything at the end. Of course her organization ends up working with the government. Everything involving her character just was not credible.Johnny Depp's character is a genius scientist, a unique man who will probably never appear again. Well.. what can you say, it is Johnny Depp after all. Bettany's character does not help much either. He is interested in Depp's wife, but she only has eyes for her husband, even when he is long gone. Once you go Depp, you'll never want anything else, right? And why is Bettany's character fighting upfront like a soldier with longtime experience in the military. There were just so many things that did not make sense sadly and those did not even necessarily have to do with the concept of transcendence.I just wish Depp would, at some point, take more risks. These films will always lure people to theaters, but they are just no success quality-wise. He needs to do something like Di Caprio did when he played Calvin Candie. Just do a movie where he is not the complete center hiding behind a huge story or massive makeup and costumes. He needs to do something more raw and essential at some point.Rebecca Hall and Morgan Freeman shine occasionally, but even the latter just feels too stereotypical: the old mentor who everybody looks up to, including Depp. I liked Freeman's and Hall's scene together with the little note he gives her. The animation with everything growing up quickly was done nicely too and another thing I liked about the film is that there is no clean-cut good and evil, no black and white just the way it is in reality. The concept was actually an interesting one and they succeeded in displaying how we are scared of new technical achievements as they are not examined properly yet. They may or may not work, but consequences, if they won't, may be drastic and painful to many. Unfortunately, the movie sometimes got lost in all the technical and scientific inclusions. You'd probably have to be a scientist to understand properly everything that was going on.Finally I would have liked the film to end when they arrested Hall's character and told her that Transcendence was over instead of when it actually ended. This way it would have been a bit of an unexpected point of time to roll in the credits, but instead they went for the showier ending, the one that had more visual significance than story significance. Style over substance sadly is a statement which describes many of Depp's recent works including this one. They easily could have cut 15 minutes or even more out of the film and it would not have gotten worse, probably even better. This way, I would possibly even have recommended watching it, but the way it turned out I can't. Skip.",Transcendence
5,claudio_carvalho,People Are Afraid of Things They do not Understand,5,27 July 2014,"In New York, Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is one of the three most brilliant scientists in the research of Artificial Intelligence. He works with his beloved wife and also scientist Evelyn Caster (Rebecca Hall) and his best friend is Dr. Max Waters (Paul Bettany). Dr. Caster is forced to go to a lecture to raise funds for their research but a group of anti-technology terrorists attack him and the two other authorities in the field of AI. Dr. Caster is poisoned and has only one month of life. When Will is near to death, Evelyn discusses with Max the possibility of transferring his emotions to the AI and they decide to try. They seem to be well succeeded, but they are attacked by the terrorists commanded by Bree (Kate Mara) that destroy the facility and Evelyn releases Dr. Caster's ""soul"" in the Internet to save him. Soon Dr. Caster controls the worldwide system and with his increasing knowledge, he changes human biology and the environment becoming an omnipresent power. But people are afraid of things they do not understand and Dr. Caster is considered a threat to the world that shall be destroyed.""Transcendence"" is a sci-fi film with a promising premise, great cinematography, good performances and special effects but with a poorly written story with messy characters. Bree, for example, is a terrorist responsible for the death of Dr. Caster and his colleagues and for jump the gun and release Dr. Caster in the Internet by Evelyn to save him from her direct attack. In the end, she works with FBI Agent Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) and Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman). A subject of this magnitude should have been discussed by the Powers that Be, and not by a simple FBI agent, an outmoded scientist and a terrorist. I could write many other inconsistencies in the story, but better off let the viewer conclude by himself (or herself). My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Transcendence - A Revolução"" (""Transcendence – The Revolution"")",Transcendence
6,nogodnomasters,I THINK THEREFORE I AM,6,21 October 2018,"The film starts out in Berkley and there is no electrical power...anywhere, perhaps. It then flashes back 5 years as there is a clash between ""neo-Luddites"" and those that want to create artificial intelligence. Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) has the last project that wasn't destroyed...although he himself took a bullet laced with radioactive polonium and is now dying.Will's wife and colleague Evelyn (Rebecca Hall) has the idea of sticking an electrode in Will's brain and uploading him to the computer. Will connects to the Internet and unlocks secrets of nanotechnology. He wants to use the knowledge to cure the sick, clean the air, clean the water, regrow forests, and create an army of followers with brain implants. He would become a ""God"" which scares a whole bunch of people.The special effects were decent, but not overwhelming. Johnny Depp was lifeless in his role, as are too many science fiction characters. The film asks several questions to ponder, such as how will we know when a computer has consciousness? What are the limits we will allow robots to control our lives?The film utilizes nanotechnology, perhaps beyond its limits. There is a new generation of devices coming out using new substances such as graphene which will make everything we own obsolete. BTW, Government facilities such as depicted in the film utilizes iris scans in Top Secret areas and not simple card swipes.This is a slow paced cerebral science fiction film that is not for everyone.Parental Guide: No f-bombs that I recall. No nudity. Brief covered sex scene.",Transcendence
7,kosmasp,Subtle look into the future(?),9,15 September 2014,"The movie is obviously not everyones cup of tea. It's very subtle and its very understated performances leave room for speculation most of the time, which when resolved might disappoint some viewers. It doesn't make this less appealing for those who like to have food for thought, rather than just some flashy action scenes and thrilling set pieces/scenes with no substance.There is a thrilling aspect here and things do happen. But it might not be what people expect and therefor the result will probably disappoint. Nevertheless, the movie itself is more than a great ride. It's an experience, which asks and answers question. Not all of them, but enough to make you think (if you want to) and wonder how you'd react in a similar situation ... and would that be the ""right"" choice?",Transcendence
8,Sleepin_Dragon,A good film with awesome special effects.,7,26 September 2017,"Transcendence is quite a difficult film to review, I left the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed, I suppose my expectations were so high, but having rewatched at home I feel I was too harsh. When you break down the film and start to see what they were trying to do, it makes more sense, the simple study of a human relationship, and the lengths people will go to for love. The special effects are dazzling, you can see a lot of bucks went into its production. Well performed, Johnny Depp is as always spot on, Rebecca Hall and Paul Bettany both perform well also. It does a good job in raising the question of human evolution, and playing on the fear people have over it. At times the script and it's delivery seem a bit clunky, very little to hate, but hard to love.Underrated 7/10",Transcendence
9,lee_eisenberg,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.",5,5 August 2014,"""Transcendence"", the directorial debut of Christopher Nolan's cinematographer Wally Pfister, is one of those movies that has a good plot but isn't executed as well as it could be. Although I like Johnny Depp, I thought that Morgan Freeman's character was underused. In general the movie comes across as plodding; maybe Nolan would have done a better job with it. If the movie has a redeeming quality, it's the part about electromagnetic radiation. The World Health Organization does qualify said radiation as a carcinogen, and an electromagnetic pulse could cause all electricity to suddenly stop working.So, it's an OK movie, but when it comes to artificial intelligence, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains the best one. Another interesting one is ""Eagle Eye"".",Transcendence
10,jboothmillard,Transcendence,6,23 October 2014,"I saw the trailer for this a few times in the cinema, with a good cast list and great special effects it looked like it could be a cool film, I knew bits and pieces about the plot as well, so it was definitely something I wasn't going to miss out on. Basically in New York, foremost Artificial Intelligence researcher and scientist Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is working to create a sentient (conscious) machine combining everything ever known in collective intelligence with the full range of human emotions, his highly controversial experiments have gained admiration and made him famous, but he has also become prime target to anti- technology extremists. Following a murder attempt by suicidal ""Revolutionary Independence From Technology"" (R.I.F.T.) member James Thomas (Witness's Lukas Haas), Caster was shot by a polonium laced bullet, in hospital he is given a month at most to live, so he gets the wheels in motion for the quantum computer, what he calls ""Transcendence"", his desperate wife Evelyn (Dorian Gray's Rebecca Hall) uploads Will's consciousness into the system, and soon enough Will dies from poisoning. Will's best friend and fellow researcher Max Waters (Paul Bettany) knows that the technology is there to bring Will back, but the question remains if it should be done, both for emotional and scientific ethics, but Will's consciousness survives in the experiment, he requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge, Max is not convinced that the computer intelligence is not the real Will, but Evelyn continues regardless. Slowly though it becomes apparent that this Will is thirsty for knowledge, he is evolving more and more as Evelyn follows his instructions, his new-found vast intelligence is able to build a technological utopia of satellite dishes, solar panels and other machinery in a remote desert town called Brightwood. But Will's intelligence spreads also into groundbreaking new technologies in the fields of medicine, energy, biology and nanotechnology, for example he is able to bring dying flowers back to life and cure a man of his blindness, Evelyn amazed by the power Will has conjured will not listen to the reasoning of Max, until of course Will displays the ability to connect to and control the minds of people, she questions his motivations. Evelyn agrees with Max, FBI agent Donald Buchanan (Cillian Murphy) and government scientist Joseph Tagger (Morgan Freeman) that Will must be stopped, as he is spreading to all computer systems across the world, with R.I.F.T. a computer virus is developed to delete Will's source code, this will kill him, but as a consequence a technological civilisation will be destroyed, all are forced to choose between uploading the virus or risking assimilation into Will's Transcendence. Will is aware of this plan and tries to sway Evelyn, presenting her with his ability to reemerge in physical, but the activists nearby fire upon the Brightwood base, Evelyn is mortally wounded, Will has to decide whether to save her taking her mind like she did for him, and in doing so upload the virus, after hesitation chooses to spare the people, the virus kills both Will and Evelyn, global technology collapses and blackout occurs, three years later in the non-technological civilisation Max does notice that remnants of Will's nano-particles remain to cleanse and heal. Also starring 127 Hours' Kate Mara as Bree, Cole Hauser as Colonel Stevens, Clifton Collins Jr. as Martin, Battle: Los Angeles's Cory Hardrict as Joel Edmund, Falk Hentschel as Bob, Josh Stewart as Paul and Xander Berkeley as Dr. Thomas Casey. Depp is charismatic both in real and digital form, Hall does well as his vulnerable wife, Bettany is suitable as the morally conflicted colleague, and Murphy and Freeman get just enough time on screen to do their stuff, this is a most intriguing premise, in the world there are concerns that technology may be taking over too much of our lives in many forms, so this works well as an ""imagine if technology took over"" scenario, I agree the philosophical and playing with God stuff wanes a little in places, but the fantastic special effects really bring it to life, all together a watchable science-fiction action thriller drama. Good!",Transcendence
11,rmax304823,A Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Set Free.,6,6 March 2015,"That Rebecca Hall is a paragon of pulchritude is unarguable. She has this endearing overbite that lends her sibilants a lisp, so that ""space"" comes out ""thpathe"". Love it.The imagery -- that is, what is seen on the screen -- is magnificent. No kidding. Raindrops in slow motion. Sunflowers opening and closing. Dark laboratories (too dark) and splendid vistas of landscapes that go on to infinity. Crisp closeups of glistening teeth and watery eyes. Applause for the photographer, Jess Hall.Sadly, much of the story makes no sense. It begins coherently enough. Johnny Depp is a scientist who has his brain uploaded just before he dies. Then, in a quest for more power to do what he thinks is good for the world, he demands that his electronic brain now be permitted to take over the internet, and once that's achieved, the rest of the electricity in the entire world. His image appears on monitors and TV screens. He performs miracle cures with nanotechnology. He's going to save the earth.So far, so familiar. We've been in this territory before. There was HAL in ""2001"", the movie ""Frankenstein,"" the runaway zero-toleance computer in ""Collosus: The Forbin Project"", and other examples. It's kind of interesting, although drawn out and inexplicable to the ordinary mortal.Then it shifts gears and pits a gang of Luddites against the neurologically altered community that Depp has created for himself and his wife, Hall, in the middle of some desert wasteland. These myrmidons are without emotion and evidently immortal. You shoot them down but their wounds heal in a few seconds. This too is familiar. There are the pod people from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" the zombies from ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and countless others.There is a big shoot out at the end. During this, the story leaves any familiarity behind and reaches for Terra Incognita, for the stars, for the galaxy.It becomes utter nonsense with no explanation given for the events, not even the usual scientific-sounding mumbo jumbo you get in B movies: ""Captain, we've activated the parabolic node of the epsilon warp indicator."" ""Some kind of nuclear power, I suppose."" These little CGI wisps rise up from the ground and into the clouds and then pour down as nanotechnologically ripe drops that fall on everybody and everything. The nanocytes reproduce like a virus. But what the hell difference does it make? Nothing happens anyway.There's a final scene in which the now dead Depp describes the earth of the future, ""water so pure you can drink from any river,"" and we're treated to a cinematic tour of landscapes that have no freeways and no McDonalds. But what does this sequence MEAN? Depp is defunct, and the uploaded virus has killed all the programs, if that's the word, that he's created.It looks like a thoughtful movie but I don't know what it's trying to say because it seems to be suffering from expressive aphasia or else I'm too dumb to understand it. Maybe it's a different language. Martian, maybe.",Transcendence
12,Tweekums,A solid enough sci-fi,7,17 April 2016,"Dr Will Castor is a preeminent scientist in the field of artificial intelligence and he is working to create a self-aware supercomputer. However it looks as if the entire field of AI is going to be set back years after neo-luddite terrorists kill many of its leading experts; Castor is shot with a bullet coated in polonium; it didn't kill him outright but he will die in approximately a month. Ironically this forces his wife, Evelyn, to radically accelerate his work and upload his conciseness into a computer and then onto the internet. Here his intelligence increases exponentially and he is able to create new technology that could take mankind to the next level of evolution or enslavement. Castor's friend and colleague, Max Waters, is kidnapped by the terrorists and must decide whether to help them and Evelyn must decide whether the AI is really her husband or something more sinister.This film has some interesting if not particularly new ideas. The story is told in a solid fashion that kept me interested from start to finish without delivering any real surprises. The cast does a decent enough job although the film's big name, Johnny Depp, doesn't really get a chance to shine as for most of the time he is just a face on a computer screen and a voice on a speaker. Rebecca Hall is more memorable in the roll of Evelyn. For the most part the effects look good and first time director Wally Pfister tells the story well; I wouldn't be surprised if he goes onto better things. Overall a solid enough film; worth watching if it is on TV but probably not one to seek out unless you are a fan of the genre or of one of the cast members.",Transcendence
13,sunwarrior13,Visually Stunning,8,23 March 2015,"Transcendence is the directorial debut of cinematographer Wally Pfister ,who normally works in collaboration with one of the great Hollywood directors,Christopher Nolan.This film presents the premise of the possibility of human beings being capable of having artificial intelligence.It stars Johnny Depp together with Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany and Morgan Freeman. Dr. Will Caster is a scientist motivated by curiosity about the nature of consciousness and the foremost researcher on the field of artificial intelligence.He works together with a team that includes his wife and fellow scientist,Evelyn.They are working to create a sentient machine that combines collective intelligence that is capable of human emotion as well.Unfortunately,their experiments have made them targets of anti-technology terrorists.One day,Will was shot with polonium that give him only one month to live.In the process,Evelyn and his fellow researcher,Dr.Max Waters made Will the catalyst that enabled them to succeed in their research as they were able to use Will as a participant in his own transcendence in their artificial intelligence project.Events follow as they face threats from the terrorists;Will manages to obtain omnipresence and power similar to God; and soon the morality issue as they question themselves as to whether continue with it or not.In his first directorial debut,Pfister has succeeded in making it a visually stunning film.The visual effects are definitely wonderful and marvelous.Too bad that the screenplay written by Jack Paglen came up empty especially with the questions regarding the issues about technology that were presented in the movie.It also was boring in some parts as it fails to tackle the issues about technology due to its simplistic and somehow incoherent dialogues and it fails to provide answers with conviction about it.What's worse,it also added implausible events in the plot that would somehow confuse the viewer.Too bad that the talented cast that included Depp,Hall,Bettany and Freeman have to do with everything that the screenplay provides as their performances were limited by it.As for Hollywood superstar Johnny Depp,this is another not-so-good film that he made after being in the extremely boring and Razzie winner,The Lone Ranger.Overall,it was presented as a sophisticated movie that came up short due to its lack of substance.",Transcendence
14,Scarecrow-88,Transcendence,7,9 January 2015,"Fascinating science fiction film about the possible dangers (and limitless possibilities) of artificial intelligence if someone's consciousness were ""uploaded into the internet superhighway"". Johnny Depp is such a scientist murdered by members of a ""terrorist"" cell with an agenda to halt the use of computers and how their tech might ""go too far"". Evolution through nanotechnology and how Depp's genius (who dies after a ""poisoned bullet"" enters his bloodstream) can ""repair"" the human body (after someone who works for Depp's company is badly beaten, he is ""made whole"", while another man, who is blind, is ""fixed"" to see), clean the atmosphere (from pollutants manmade), and make things grow (like trees and foliage) among other amazing accomplishments is focused on this film. Rebecca Hall is Depp's lover and soulmate who shares his ambitions but her own dreams are perhaps on the horizon thanks to what he is doing within the framework of the internet where travel and input are available to him. What this film does is state that death might separate two from each other physically but maybe through the use of technology they can still communicate, work together, and even share experiences (through the use of nanotech, Depp can use the bodies of others as host organisms for his own consciousness). Depp seems to be the man Hall remembers but something about his use of other humans and how through the nanotech's evolving state (it keeps humans from dying, provides them strength, and allows them to get right back up and do as Depp wishes) it can even rise into the clouds, and rain ""dna rewriting tech"" onto all humankind, ""perfecting them of what they lack"" concerns her. An entire globe of Depps is feared by Kate Mara and her team of ""anti-Depp"" infiltrators, needing the support and insight of his old scientist pal, Paul Bettany. Bettany refuses at first, but he sees their reasoning as evolving tech's dangers (a globe of Depps) are very real. With Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and Cole Hauser as eventual adversaries of Depp due to how frightening his presence is and could further be, the cast is solid top to bottom. You can see both sides and why the technology could be viewed as good and bad according to whoever is asked. Hall's moral dilemma and drawing away from Depp is a key dramatic component of the film, and the question about how far should technology be allowed to go is addressed compellingly. Not a bad little sci-fi film, and it has food for thought.",Transcendence
15,LeonLouisRicci,"Singularly Dull, also Disappointing and Dumbed-Downed",4,24 August 2014,"In the Early Days of Sci-Fi Cinema there were these Low Budget, Absurd Movies about Brains and how to Keep them Alive After Death.

16,CinemaSerf,"Decent concept, poor execution.",6,24 September 2021,"This is quite a good looking and stylish sci-fi thriller with Johnny Depp (""Caster"") as a cutting edge scientist in the field of AI. As you'd expect, his success is met with plaudits from some, but with threats for others - threats that lead to a complex scenario playing out that proves there is a fine line between a benign id and power-hungry megalomania. The storyline is interesting, and the writing - though really pretty clunky - sets out to tell us a story that is engaging and thought provoking. However, it all just gets bogged down in a rather obvious procedural delivery that really only allows Paul Bettany (""Max"") to offer us anything more than routine on the characterisation front. Morgan Freeman, Rebecca Hall and Cillian Murphy are all here too, but they are not really - their efforts are contrived and unconvincing, as are many of the rather underwhelming visual effects. At two hours, it could have been better constructed - we linger too long on tangential issues, take far too long to get going and then when we do - there are simply no surprises. Shame, could have been - and should have been - better.",Transcendence
17,zardoz-13,Depp In The Machine,7,21 April 2014,"The new Johnny Depp thriller ""Transcendence"" is a smart, intelligent, often lackluster science fiction epic that doesn't stoop to cheap tricks. The predictable but entertaining story unfolds at an unhurried pace, and it reminded me of the late Michael Crichton's novel ""Prey"" because it deals with nano technology. I don't think mainstream audiences will embrace it because it makes you think rather than scream and holler. Incidentally, ""Transcendence"" is a ghost in the machine melodrama with a strong cast and interesting ideas. After he is wounded with a poisonous bullet by cyber-terrorists, Dr. Will Caster learns that he has about a month to live. A genius in artificial intelligence whose goal has been to invent a machine that boasts sentience and collective intelligence, Caster manages to launch his entire brain into a computer with the help of his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall of ""The Town) and his closest collaborator Mark Waters (Paul Bettany). Things go awry for our hero who only wants to make life better for everybody. Eventually, Marks is captured by the cyber-terrorists and they turn him against Caster. Meantime, our hero resides on the Internet and has a vast complex both above ground and below ground that contains his genius. Gradually, Evelyn begins to have doubts about everything that her husband and she have spent their lives working on. The ending is something of a surprise.",Transcendence
18,grantss,"Intriguing, then silly, then tedious",5,7 May 2015,"Intriguing, then silly, then tedious.Transcendence started well and with a lot of promise. Good set up and initial plot development, which should have made for an interesting and possibly profound second half.Unfortunately, no sooner are you thinking this than the movie falls apart. Script becomes silly, with tangential departures from the plot, sub-plots that come out of nowhere and are mostly quite ludicrous. The intellectual premise is replaced with randomness and then your generic action scenes and superficial emotional scenes. Once the silliness set in it becomes quite boring, quite quickly.Even the acting talents of Johnny Depp and Morgan Freeman can't save this.",Transcendence
19,george.schmidt,Downloading Depp,6,19 April 2014,"TRANSCENDENCE (2014) ** Johnny Depp, Rebecca Hall, Morgan Freeman, Paul Bettany, Cillian Murphy, Kate Mara, Cole Hauser, Clifton Collins, Jr., Xander Berkeley, Lukas Haas, Wallace Langham. Scattershot sci-fi high concept suspensor with Depp as a tech genius whose passing is superseded by downloading his intelligence into the Internet (or some such nonsense) to create a new, better world at any cost in the progress of mankind. For Wally Pfister (Christopher Nolan's longtime cinematographer making his directorial debut and his boss as an executive producer) the production overall is stellar but the flat-footed script by Jack Paglen (also his first work produced for the big-screen) and misplaced talent (i.e. Murphy is wasted while Mara's hard-eyed villainous terrorist is implausibly laughable) fail to elicit much interest, sympathy for the devil or even an illegal download.",Transcendence
