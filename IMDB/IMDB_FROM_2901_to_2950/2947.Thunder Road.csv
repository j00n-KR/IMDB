0,evanston_dad,Astonishing,10,6 September 2019,"""Thunder Road"" had been sitting on my Netflix queue for quite a while. Then I saw that it was one of the options on a flight from Phoenix to Chicago. I didn't end up having time to watch the whole thing, but I just wanted to see what kind of movie it was, so I watched the first few minutes. Anyone who's seen the film knows what those first 10 minutes or so are like, and probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that I immediately moved it to the top of my queue so that I could see the whole thing.""Thunder Road"" may seem simple; it's practically a one-man show. But it is quietly astonishing in the way it's written and especially acted by Jim Cummings. He plays a man at a crisis point in his life, trying to hang on to a daughter during a nasty divorce while watching his career as a police officer crumble due to his unhinged behavior. He's a man who means well and wants to do right by himself and those around him, but can't control himself from messing up in both small and major ways. The film is hilarious, but it always walks that knife edge between funny and uncomfortable. This kind of dark humor is a tight rope act to pull off, but Cummings is expert at it, and I was absolutely fascinated by him and his performance. I didn't really want the movie to end, because I wanted to keep on spending time with this guy, even though he's exhausting to be with. That's the sign of a truly gifted actor.You know, lately there has been so much complaining about white males and how everything has always been told through a white male perspective and that now it's time for women and people of color to take the stage and tell their stories. I embrace all stories and love seeing the world through the point of view of people who are very different from me. But ""Thunder Road"" is an example of how stories about and told by white men can still be interesting too, and we'd be making a mistake as a culture to just outright decide that white men's stories are no longer worth listening to just because we've been hearing them for so long.Grade: A+",Thunder Road
1,deloudelouvain,For Jim Cummings alone it's already worth watching.,7,23 May 2019,"To be honest I never heard of Jim Cummings before, not as an actor nor as a writer, nor as a director, but after watching Thunder Road I will remember him in the future. This movie is a strange mixture of drama and comedy. You never completely know if it is sadness or laughter they were looking for and that's all credit to the excellent acting of Jim Cummings. I never saw a grown man crying so much in a movie and still be funny due to his facial expressions whilst crying. I truly enjoyed Thunder Road and I'm sure plenty of others will do also. An easy to watch story, with mixed emotions, but in the end better than I thought it would be.",Thunder Road
2,westsideschl,Cheap (Look at the budget.),3,14 December 2018,"First sign of a cheap to produce and distribute production is that the DVD has no menu in the beginning (e.g. chapters, specials), and most importantly no subtitles for the less proficient English speaking or those w/hearing issues. Enunciations & audio were OK, but not good enough to compensate, not that it mattered as nothing of value is said anyway. As for the script you have an acts weird/bizarre, needs psychological help, cop that you ask yourself how he got the job and is still on the job. To make matters worse some of his fellow cops are also a little bizarre and not the ""right stuff"" for the job. Not good image making for the people who have that tough job. Was there suppose to be humor in his antics? Not even close unless you are into drunks who act & say anything. Very forgettable (and wasted) 90 min.",Thunder Road
3,nairtejas,Molecule Review: Thunder Road (7 Stars),7,5 January 2019,"In Thunder Road, director Jim Cummings carves an almost perfect study of a character going through an emotional breakdown after the death of his mother. So much that together with Cummings's superb performance and a somber soundtrack that drives melancholy home, it is perhaps the very reason why the dark comedy drama is one of the best films to come out in 2018. There's so much to look and think about in Thunder Road, in some scenes, I just could not feel I had a bowl of popcorn in my hands. It's splendid and you need to watch it right now. TN.",Thunder Road
4,imseeg,Cops are only human too. Tragic portrait of a cop loosing his mind after a death in the family...,7,27 February 2020,"Quirky, sad, funny, unique, strangely fascinating.Directed, written, produced AND acted by Jim Cummings. A personal portrait about loosing one's mind after a terrible loss in the family. It's not a tearjerker and although it is certainly not a straightforward comedy either, it still has got enough comical scenes, which make this sad portrait easily watchable.The good: it's very personal and honest. A good, subtle character portrait. Delicate balance between absurd and sad behaviour, which confused me, but fascinated me as well.The bad: the cop who is distraught by grief never really becomes someone who I could really sympathize with, because his behaviour (although caused by grief) was so outlandish and bizarre, although it was still understandable. Not suited for the casual movie goer, because this movie is quite odd and dark at some moments. But it has definitely got enough charm and originality to fascinate anyone with an open mind about stories about psychological pain.",Thunder Road
5,joiningjt,"Sorry mr Cummings this TOTALLY misses the mark, extremely negative film!! No fun!!",1,24 December 2020,"The wolf of snow hallow was so good and was directed,Written and starring mr Cummings so when I read about this film I thought no brainer. It starts out decent then just pounds and pounds negative dialogue and story. Some is ok but give us some humor some normalcy but this is relentless negative dialogue and acting. I finally had enough after 1 hour and turned it off. I rarely turn any movie off but my wife and i couldnt take anymore it was like getting beat up we raised the white flag!! Trust me this is a total miss highly suggest you watch something else like the wolf of snow hollow. This movie is like watching the news!!!!",Thunder Road
6,valleyjohn,A brilliant one man movie,8,6 October 2020,"This is what you the term Hidden
Gem was made for . Originally a short , this was written
, directed and acted by the brilliant Jim Cummings and if it wasn't a film from two years ago it would be one of my favourites of 2020.Jim Cummings stars as a police officer from Texas who deals with the death of his mother while giving a heartfelt eulogy at her funeral. Inspired by the music of singer-songwriter, Bruce Springsteen.There have been many good films ( and bad) about someone having a melt down. It's kind of heartening In a sick way to see it happening to someone else and not yourself but this melt down is unlike any other I've seen on screen.It's funny and sad at the same time and the performance from Jim Cummings it amazing .
Jim Armand is a man who's life is collapsing around him. He's very angry but he's not a bad guy , in fact he's a nice guy , so subsequently his anger is almost apologetic.
Cumming's has written some wonderful dialogue here and because he's acting it as well , he absolutely nails it.
The emotional scenes are funny and cringeworthy and you can't help but root for Jim.The first ten minutes is an eulogy to his mother at her funeral and it's breathtakingly brilliant .
Thankfully I don't go to many funerals but if I did , I want them to be as entertaining as this one!Highly Recommended",Thunder Road
7,fmwongmd,Not too funny,4,20 May 2019,Cute but not sustaining comedic story. It just wasn't funny anymore after the opening eulogy scene,Thunder Road
8,martimusross,A Film Without A Hero,5,8 December 2019,"Thunder RoadUp to a point I enjoyed this movie but ultimately it could not rise above its subject matter.Jim Cummings as Jim Arnaud gave a brilliant portrayal of a man who was distraught following the death of his beloved mother and then just kicked down further and further by life and his disability to predictable destitution.The redemption of this movie followed the accidental overdose of his ex-wife, an unpredictable event to pivot the plot on.There was an irritating freneticism to this movie that stemmed from Jim Cummings interpretation of his disability that was unvarying and became tiresome. This was a movie without a hero and as such lost all focus.",Thunder Road
9,muamba_eats_toast,Tragic but hilarious,8,2 April 2020,Sometimes the subject was so dark I actually felt bad that I was laughing so hard at it but if you're into your dark quirky comedies like me you're probably going to like this. If you take it to seriously you may leave more traumatised than happy however.,Thunder Road
10,MadamWarden,BLUNDER ROAD,3,12 June 2020,"Honestly, I really wanted to like this. An Indy movie giving it a go. But.... I struggle to get a grip on it. Was it a comedy? Not funny. Was it a drama? Too far fetched and unrealistic. Satire? No message.Most unsatisfying",Thunder Road
11,spookyrat1,But Seriously Folks ...!,5,10 June 2020,"I can understand why Thunder Road has an IMDB rating of 7.1 (at time of writing) and an even higher Metacritic rating, but that doesn't mean I feel a need to join in the fanfare. I also love a good independent film, made on a tight budget, which through the strength of its story, is able to show up many of its higher-priced Hollywood cousins churning out extravagant, unoriginal generic pap. But here's the thing! Thunder Road, based on a short film of the same name, has no real story. It's like a series of semi-related and totally unrelated sketches, jumbled together in the vain hope that viewers will make some sense of what follows and appreciate the travails of police officer Jim Arnaud, as he negotiates his mixed up life, whilst coming to terms with the death of his mother.Really what has the episode with the female high school student driven home got to do with just about anything? She disappears from the narrative, only to be (we gather) scoped out by Jim, in a long , uncomfortable scene, after he drops his daughter at school, much later in the film. What does this say about Jim? A character OD's late in the film, but it just seems like a convenience thing to provide a half-downbeat ending, instead of a full blown one. There's been nothing to occur earlier, that suggested this might happen. Jim has a meeting with his sister late in the movie and she's about the only person you feel, he's somewhat close to. And you're left wondering, given his myriad of conflicting issues, why he waits so long to contact her. There is little continuity in Thunder Road. It's entirely episodic, like an unfunny variety show.The humour (and this movie is promoted as a comedy drama) is without exception, of the awkward variety. In other words if you are the sort of person who gets the giggles from watching people screaming/crying/having a tantrum/taking their clothes off at an inappropriate moment, or continually saying the wrong socially acceptable response to questions, this is indeed the movie for you. Others be aware. There's not much to look forward to.You will note I'm giving it a 5. The film does have some merit. I was impressed with Jim Cummings acting and I appreciate the work he has put into the production. Besides taking the lead role and being in most scenes, he has written the screenplay, composed the music and co-edited the film. Definitely a man for all seasons! I'm surprised he wasn't manning the candy bar in cinema foyers. So in Thunder Road, he does reveal his potential, But unfortunately does this, in a messy, bleak, often cringeworthy affair.",Thunder Road
12,brankovranjkovic,Thunder Road - Never quite breaks down but is on a constant knife-edge,9,7 June 2019,"Indi film - Considered a comedy but with deeper themes.Jim Cummings is the writer, director and lead actor who has produced a deeply emotional film with mental health at its core.The lead actor (Jim) is a decorated police officer, but who is treated with suspicion due to his potential to fly into a rage. The film starts with a funeral, and an uncomfortable eulogy, which is delivered by Jim, the deceased son. This is a difficult scene to watch due to his deeply emotional problems.He is having to simultaneously deal with several stressful situations, Divorce - mother's passing - daughter miss-behaving at school. Everyone can relate to something, Jim is on downward spiral of self-destruction, he never quite breaks down but is on a constant knife-edge.Highly recommended.",Thunder Road
13,SameirAli,Awesome.,9,29 August 2021,"One of the best indie films of the recent times. Being the lead role and directing the movie is not an easy job. But, Jim Cummings done it so well.",Thunder Road

15,ronakkotian,Jim Cummings: An up-and-coming talent,8,23 September 2020,"There was a lot of buzz surrounding this film in the indie circuit so I decided to give it a watch on Netflix and considering its limitations, Thunder Road turned out to be a great film.Thunder Road follows a police officer who tries to connect with his daughter whilst struggling with his divorce and mother's death.What really stood out to me about this film was just how well made it was. I searched online for the budget and found out it was $200,000. This really impressed me as I thought the film had a budget of $1-2 million. There are so many brilliant scenes in this film that are very demanding and a ton of praise has to go to Jim Cummings. He wrote, directed, edited, did the music and even played the lead character. I loved the risks he decided to take. Most indie films with low budgets like Thunder Road wouldn't attempt to do long takes, with a lot of action taking place, that go on for 4-5 minutes. There are multiple scenes where we see Jim Cummings deliver lengthy monologues that demand a lot of emotion from him and imagining how many takes it must have taken to get it right tells me the amount of skill Jim Cummings and the rest of the crew possess. It's these scenes that elevate the quality of the film and show how much care was put into it.Another aspect I really liked were the way characters interacted with one another. The dialogue were well thought out and the dialogue delivery from the actors made it feel very natural. The performances were really good. Jim Cummings honestly did a fantastic job as the flawed but likeable police officer. The monologues demand a lot from him and I thought he did a great job conveying those emotions. The only part of his performance I'm conflicted about is his crying. It seemed a bit forced instead of flowing naturally. Child performances worry me but Kendal Farr, who plays his daughter, managed to play her character well.Whilst I think Jim Cummings did a great job acting, directing, writing and editing, the music wasn't up to the level as those four. The score wasn't particularly great which is why I think Jim Cummings should work with a professional and experienced musician for his future work in order to improve the quality of the music.Aside from that, Thunder Road was a surprising venture. It amazed me what Cummings and his team were able to create despite their low budget. This film shows how you can make great films regardless of your budget. I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for Jim Cummings' future projects as I believe he is an up-and-coming talent that can achieve a lot.",Thunder Road
16,Rendanlovell,A bit showy but great regardless,8,29 October 2018,"I really liked this movie. The star is obviously writer, director, and leading actor Jim Cummings. The movie consists of a ton of impressive one takes that really show off how talented he is both in front of, and behind the camera. He's magnetic on the screen switching effortlessly from sobs to anger to remorse. Which not only made for an engaging performance but a compelling character study. Our main character is both horrifically unlikable but incredibly sympathetic. The movie opens with an insanely long scene of him having a full on melt down at his mom's funeral and from here his life gradually falls apart. It's a simple but engaging story really anchored by great writing and competent filmmaking",Thunder Road
17,jackgdemoss,Jim Cummings is a triple threat,8,2 July 2019,"Raw and potent emotions. Thunder Road strives due to Jim Cummings portrayal of how humans in the real-world display anger, confusion, sorrow, and thrilled excitement. Until now, I was yet to see a film properly show that feeling when you are so excited that you tear up a bit and hold an ugly but genuine smile. A majority of Thunder Road is actually just long shot monologues by Cummings' character, but it is performed so well that it works without boring the audience. There really was not rising or falling action because it was so grounded in reality, which rarely has such a pattern. This 90-minute watch is worth every second of the time spent.",Thunder Road
18,daoldiges,Really Good Moments Here,7,5 November 2019,"I have to say I was expecting a bit more comedy/humor when I decided to check out Thunder Road. While it didn't deliver the quantity of laughs I expected it did provide some touchingly laughable moments. There's an overarching feeling of sadness this film delivers for me. Both are deeply felt thanks to the genuine and powerful performance by Cummings, he really is very good here. The film does feel a bit uneven at times but in general worth checking out.",Thunder Road
19,mosquitobite,TISM this is serious mum not a comedy,8,7 June 2020,"Great effort here by jim cummings of a man struggling, was quite fascinated by him in the role and loved watching him.. seemed a weird sort of easy narrarive ""out"" killing off mom, would have preferred a more uplifting unravelling of the situation that involved personal growth where pain was healed and people ""grew up"" etc that kinda reduced its power and influence",Thunder Road
20,Ziglet_mir,The Newest Triple-Threat,10,26 December 2019,"""Thunder Road"" is a film that beautifully portrays the spectrum of emotions and tensions that arise from the routine struggles of life. There are subtle traces of comedy beneath the high-energy, raw performance we get from Jim Cummings, who has also proven he can write and direct with the best of his craft. ""Thunder Road"" is a strong debut that covers the heavy topics of divorce, mental issues, drug problems, and the very layered relationships that are within all families (mother & son, father & daughter, sister & brother, etc).I highly recommend this film. Sometimes you watch a drama and feel good that you watched it, and sometimes you watch a drama and you feel you're emotions have shifted a bit inside. The latter is the experience one gets from ""Thunder Road"". Maybe it'll hit you differently as perspective certainly matters because as a new father there is something that rings with so much truth from Cummings' performance as Jim Arnaud. At times he seems lost and out of control, but we see time and time again that he has a head on his shoulders and is capable of handling what life throws at him, even when he feels he can't. We see him articulate his thoughts nearly perfectly, and yet, he still can come across a way he did not intend. Sometimes life is overwhelming, but we just have to get back up.So far it's the best I've seen from 2018.",Thunder Road
21,RMurray847,"Really, really strange, different and exhilarating.",7,22 March 2021,"THUNDER ROAD begins at a funeral. Actor/director/writer Jim Cummings plays Officer Jim, a cop who comes to the front of the church to eulogize his mother. This scene is one of the most amazing and unexpected scenes I've ever watched. In a few minutes, Officer Jim veers wildy from moments of light humor while recollecting his mom, to unstoppable tears, to deeply inappropriate dancing to, frankly, a total, emotional breakdown unlike any you've seen. This guy just looses his cool, but in a way that feels unique and organic. He's all over the place, and we laugh and then we're just appalled for him. It feels real and specific and is very moving and yet uncomfortably laughable at the same time. I've not seen anything quite like it. (Apparently, this scene was originally a short film Cummings made and used to scrounge up enough funding to stretch this character's experiences into a feature film.)The scene is probably the best thing in the movie, as we move out of the church and spend more time with Jim and, in particular, his young daughter. The girl's mother is a mess...Jim cares for her and is deeply angry at her at the same time. In fact, Jim is subject to fits of rage. He is clearly carrying around a lot of grief and confusion, and he doesn't really have an outlet or anyone to ""talk to"" about it. He's a proud man who doesn't want to admit he's hurting. His temper is sometimes comical and sometimes terrifying. He is, in short, a mess. But you've never seen a character quite like this or a mess quite like it either. Cummings, who is not necessarily the most gifted actor ever, has a quality about him that I've not really seen in another ""star."" We can laugh with him and at him, and be infuriated by him yet root for him deeply. His brand of ""messed-up-ness"" is singular and we feel like we're seeing a real person break down.But, despite the mess that Jim has become, the result of the movie (and it's string of odd incidents) is a feeling of hope and uplift. Life is never going to be perfect, far from it...but perhaps Jim learns to appreciate the little joys and victories it brings. We suspect he'll always be a bit of a mess, but we also see that he might be pulling his act together at least a little.The film will be off-putting to some. It's low budget, and that often shows. It swings wildly in tone, often within scenes. It's tough to describe the emotional impact (is it a comedy with some drama, or a drama with some comedy, or is it even a drama that doesn't realize how silly much of it is?). Cummings has made one other film (THE WOLF OF SNOW HOLLOW) that also plays around with similar themes of anger and inchoate reaching for manly self-improvement. If you can manage it, I'd suggest a mini-film festival, with THUNDER ROAD first and then SNOW HOLLOW. While the film(s) are far from perfect, the best thing I can say is that I still can't wait to see what Cummings comes up with next. Unique!(PS: If you have the blu ray, watch the extras about how the film was funded. Crazy stuff!)",Thunder Road

23,suripat,Worth watching for an actor's performance as this,6,17 April 2019,"This movie did make me very uncomfortable at every new scene this guy played. The script wasn't of my taste either. Too dark. But, the performance of this main actor is really that good. Just watch it.",Thunder Road
24,rhmacl,Spell-binding performance,8,14 July 2019,"Jim Cummings' performance will be tallied as one of the years' stand-outs. He simply carries the entire story, pace, heart and soul of the entire production. The story is a heart-breaker; all-American middle-class white male collision with class, gender, marital, professional, generational, educational, social disasters that are cleverly combined into a believable progression which forms the framework of a story that describes how we can be slowly - or rapidly - become challenged by mental health triggers. Even more gut-wrenching is how easily the viewer identifies with the main character, or conversely, the parade of enablers who are impacted one way or another and fail to effectively intervene until it is too late, too much loss has occurred, and the proverbial rock-bottom is hit; when the hero starts the long process of reclaiming his own circumstances. Bravo to Kendal Farr who's keen acting, or capacity to be artfully directed, adds to Cummings' stellar achievement. As a father, the distance she puts between her and her character's father at the end of the opening scene when she rejects his need for closeness, and the horrified look on his face as he tries to contain the grief, sadness, love, and emotional trauma during a moment of pure need-for-affection just ripped me to shreds. You might laugh through the film, you might cry. Whatever, it will be a memorable experience whether you get caught up in the story, or just revel in Cummings' comprehensive directorial/acting tour de force.",Thunder Road
25,ianwagnerwatches,Beautifully performed and directed,8,26 September 2019,"Jim Cummings really wowed me with this one. His performance in the film and the very severe tonal shifts captured the severe highs and lows that real loss puts a human being through. The extremely long takes and shockingly low budget of this film is artistically admirable. I have been to several intimate screenings for films with a similar budget that were, in all honesty, garbage. This film is well-beyond what it has any right to be. It felt real, and it broke my heart, then pieced it back together... Mostly.I highly recommend Thunder Road to any and all fans of cinema, and I suggest they keep an eye on this creator.

27,sarathpillaijl,Short review,7,23 June 2019,"This movie definitely portrays the complex human phsycology. The amount of stress people go through after a problem. But in the end this movie also gives us a feeling of serenity that everything is going to be alright.
The direction and screenplay is ok.
The cast is wonderful although a change of cast for some roles might have improved the movie more. The lead actor is talented and perfect.

28,kevandeb,Competent effort,6,11 November 2018,"As somebody from the U.K. critiquing a US drama it is a difficult job, especially when nuances, way of life and local daily life is so difficult to encapsulate for somebody who does not live and breathe life in a certain country, state or even town.
Again, whilst I found Jim an anomaly of a character, somebody I do not recognise in the U.K. per se, I embrace that this could be normal in small town America. I did not dislike it, in fact the acting and pathos ran well with a viewers affection for the main cast and I always welcome a film that feels strong enough to omit (sometimes annoying) background music. That said, anything named after a song by the 'Peoples Poet' and one of my all time favourite songs I would like some reference to it and perhaps for it to be a backdrop to the film. Now I could be missing a trick here that the song was never played for a deeper meaning, but it would have served the film better, in my opinion, if this was a haunting backdrop to the crises being played out.

Jim Cummings is a master, and the worst part of it all is how, having written, directed, and starred in this movie that this has absolutely got to be, at some level, auto-fiction. Cummings delivers some of the best writing and acting that I've seen in some time. In short, I thought it was really a magnificent movie. Do more things, Jim.",Thunder Road

Once you get the rhythm even tragedy has absurd moments",Thunder Road
39,uberdonkey6,"Unusual, uncomfortable but good",7,2 November 2018,"Some of the scenes are uncomfortable as it shows this main (policeman) character as slightly pathetic, overly sensitive and embarrassing. The story revolves around this characters ability to cope with his mother's death, divorce and his difficult daughter. Any male that has gone through a divorce with children will sympathize with the plight of this man. However, the spin is that the main character is trying to constantly repress his emotion and 'be a good guy' even though at times he breaks. Unfortunately the plight of the modern man (where anger gets you arrested, not being angry prevents you being listened to). That sense of powerlessness that he portrays and how deeply it affects him is prominant without playing on your emotions in a predictable way - indeed the guy is not particularly likeable even though we can sympathise with him. Not a comedy, but an emotional journey that examines male friendship, divorce and separation from children, and how modern man constrains his emotions in an attempt to be acceptable to society. Possibly profound, but if it is, it's profound in a way we don't yet realise. Overall enjoyable even if a little uncomfortable. P.S. this is not for action movie fans, but probably 40 something and older men will enjoy it.",Thunder Road

But some displays of raw, unbridled, imperfect, but awesome talent demands appreciation. Some are the break-out directorial projects of great imaginations like M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, Denis Villanueve's Incendies, or the Coen Brothers' Fargo. Actor-Directors like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, or writer-actors like Sylvester Stallone in Rocky. Triple threats like Woody Allen, Charlie Chaplin, or Spike Lee. Can you imagine a fellow film-goer saying any of these in their quintessential works ""suck,"" or deserve 1 Star? Thunder Road can stand proudly among the greats.

41,embmw,Doesn't deserve the hype,1,22 October 2018,"I love dark humor in trying situations but the humor in this supposed comedy/drama is more appropriate for a Kevin James sitcom than what is apparently intended to be an emotional film. Moreover, the protagonist is unlikable, so it's difficult to have empathy for his situation (which becomes ridiculous anyway). The entire movie is filled with angst, but it has no heart. So instead of being drawn in by the characters you wind up wanting them to just go away.I usually hang on until the end in hopes a bad movie will get better, but I only made it halfway through this one and I still want my 45 minutes back. How this is rated as high as it is escapes me, unless the voting is rigged. If you want to see unstable cops acting out just watch an episode of ""Reno 911!""-- it's better than this tripe and it'll be over sooner. It you want to see dark humor done right, watch ""In Bruge"". But don't waste your time on this mess.",Thunder Road
42,MrLucasWarHero,A Wondrously Bizarre and Uneasy Dark Comedy,8,8 August 2019,"A wondrously bizarre and uneasy dark comedy about a man struggling to work through his emotions.
Thunder Road has a difficult task of measuring up to its short film predecessor (which is easily the greatest short film I've ever seen), but stands alone as an impressive first foray into feature filmmaking by newcomer Jim Cummings.
With a narrative that feels more like several chronologically linear vignettes, Cummings is able to help the viewer try their best to empathize with a character that we might have previously written off as just another hot headed cop. The humor is awkward and meanders, but when it lands its punches it really packs a blow.
Made on a shoestring budget, the performances are marvelous and impactful and help drive this film. It employs a clever use of long takes in its cinematography, although perhaps relies too heavily on them at times.
All around a great first run for Cummings and I think we should expect to see many more with his brilliantly odd blend of humor in the coming years",Thunder Road
43,Smallclone100,Shouldn't work. Does.,7,23 October 2018,"It's not often I enjoy a film with such constant tonal shifts throughout, but I did with this one. The film essentially made me laugh, made me emotive and made me think - which is all a viewer can ask for really. Right from the extraordinary opening monologue, the film grabs the viewer and reels you into the heady mix of comedy and tragedy. Some are going to hate this movie because of that. There are moments of black comedy placed into scenes of real drama - which shouldn't really work. But it does. For me at least.The focus is on single parenting, life, stress, happiness, anxiety, mental health, love. Jim Cummings wrote, directed and starred in it - and you can tell he totally believed in this project by the performance he puts in. Although he can possibly be accused of overracting at times, he is quite brilliant at others. There are some flawed moments - some real ""wtf"" scenes with a potential dealbreaking third act.The placement of comedy is the talking point in many places. But overall I would recommend this movie for those who are suckers for an indie dramedy. 7.5 / 10.",Thunder Road

I watched the trailer and assumed it would be heavy, but the trailer doesn't do this film justice. Its more than that. It's about a decorated police officer who is literally going through the worst time of his life. Losing his mom, divorce, shaky child custody and who is also having a hell of a time at work, so yeah, it's heavy. But fortunately it's interspersed with comedy in places you wouldn't expect it. We laughed aloud so many times. We also teared up. It's a beautiful story about a fighter who is falling apart but still not down for the count (""If you see me wrestling an alligator. . . help the alligator""). Themes of family, loss, and coping are prevalent. The film shows that it isn't so much about winning the game of life as it is about just making it through it with someone you love. I went through every emotion, but when the credits rolled there was a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. Too bad we live in the era where ""Black Panther"" and ""Get Out"" receive obligatory Oscar nods, and the days AND The Academy that nominated ""The English Patient"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" are long past, otherwise, this humble little movie would've OWNED Oscar night.",Thunder Road

I feel as though it's a testament to the human experience. Life can hit you hard, over and over again, and you have to get back up, that's the message I gleaned.

Nope. No such so. I should have known from the opening scene. (No spoilers). The camera rolls, unedited, for over six minutes, in one room, focused on one guy.
Cringeworthy. Boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. And that sets the pace for the whole flick. Every scene is too long. The camera just lingers, and lingers, as the lines of sparse dialog
are dispersed by a writer who apparently thinks they are funny, or somehow profound. They are neither.

Jim Cummings writing, directing and staring in this is incredible on its own. Many of the most striking scenes are filmed in one take and the performances are wild mainly from Cummings himself. Everything about this just worked really well while also being so strange and unexpected. Also the cinematography is very crisp and the overall look of the film was great.

61,mb-cunningham,This is why independent film exists.,9,25 October 2018,"If you have read the other reviews, then you will know that this movie is being judged for all the wrong reasons. Jim Cummings put his heart and soul into this film and because it is listed as a comedy and a drama, some have decided to deride this film because of it. It is what most would call a Black Comedy. I saw the official trailer for it, and anyone that saw the trailer would know that this is more drama/tragedy with dark comedic elements, but there are pedants here in internet land that wish to harp on about this film not being properly categorized. Get over it and watch the movie, because it is brilliant!
If you have ever experienced loss, then you will connect to the main character's myriad emotions. Jim Cummings does an excellent job as the beleaguered protagonist, and the film moves along at a stride that fits his circumstance, culminating in a third act that is a bit surprising, but fitting. I also loved Macon Blair (Blue Ruin), as Crystal's teacher. Independent films are not for everybody, and many of them are poorly executed, cast, or directed, but Thunder Road is the reason why I watch them, because, otherwise, all we would be presented with are big studio, unoriginal bombastic gunfight and explosion filled sensory overload. I like those movies too, but sometimes, it is a treasure to see a finely crafted and emotional character study.",Thunder Road

This portrait and character is unlike any I've seen before. The details, dialogue, and long takes provide so much realism and serve to ground the film in reality. Despite its low budget it maintains the quality of a high budget film. Thunder Road is a perfect black comedy, bringing me to the brink of tears only to have me abruptly snort in the midst of it, with its quirky, painfully awkward, and completely sympathetic lead.This is a great watch and I highly reccomend it.",Thunder Road
64,timoryhanenart,When everything goes wrong,9,20 October 2019,"The movie aroused some thoughts for me. Like when you grow older you are not ashamed to cry publically and we accept negativity and misery as part of life. The director was very convincing and I kept wondering how much of the acting was based in real life difficulties. The whole concept of making a movie must be a financial disaster as well as a very unlucky thing to do to most directors today. I thought that how people usually fail in their own goals if they even have any and how great it felt that this movie came out and it depicted a failure in the cops life. My uncle lost his whole family and he was a police officer so he must have been one of the unluckiest persons on earth. And the movie made me think about how helpless we are when everything you have is being lost and how that cycle feeds itself into the path of unlucky events until you somehow are able to put some pieces of life together. And it all happens in silence and out of reach, alone and helpless. And no one understands the downward spiral and how it makes you behave. And you realize that you are the only person who can help yourself and that is just how the world goes on without you. Then you feel lucky about the fact that no one cared and at least you were not too much of a burden to other people.",Thunder Road
65,upthetoshy,A polarizing 'comedy-drama',8,23 October 2018,"This film is obviously not for everyone, and if you're expecting a 'rom-com' you might find yourself disappointed. That said, 'Thunder Road' delivers its somber-toned narrative with nuanced humor and finesse. This was my personal introduction to Jim Cummings (who wrote, directed, and starred in the film), and in spite of the many reviewers' complaints that his character was unlikable, I must say that I was duly impressed (having experienced an unusual mix of empathy, pity, levity, and bemusement in response to his performance). It seems pretty apparent that Cummings wrote the role of 'Officer Jim Arnaud' with himself in mind for the part, and for that reason was uniquely capable of so adroitly navigating that ambivalent tight-rope that is the comedic drama (or dramatic comedy... or what-have-you).To those reviewers angrily contesting the categorization of this film (as 'comedy') I would ask you to think back to the tragicomedies of old and to remember that all is not black and white.",Thunder Road

I was stunned to see that the budget was so limited, but it has the feel of someone aiming to hit real hard. Surprisingly intense lead acting, not seen for a long time, i was really thirsty for something like that. The story and writing takes a fresh path, that takes much appreciated unexpected paths. Cinematography was all the way i enjoy it. I'll recommend this to my peeps. The mixture is just right. Keep up the great work!

His mother just died and his estranged wife plans to move away with their daughter. Though he pretends everything is fine, he has difficulties to cope with the situation, his unpredictable reactions making things worse. Alternating between tragedy and comedy, « Thunder road » explores human vulnerability and celebrates male sensitivity. The issue of toxic masculinity is implicitly addressed, the question being: how can you deal with your emotions if, as a man, you have always been told to repress them? Jim Cummings gives a strong performance. Despite overacting at times, he succeeds in making his character endearing. The most touching moments are the ones he spends with his daughter, trying his best to take care of her. This low budget movie is a very good surprise. I enjoyed its quirky atmosphere.

76,AlexAtkinUK,Not a comedy but I feel a lot of people are missing the point here,7,18 June 2019,"There is nothing funny about seeing someone having a breakdown, so I really don't understand why this is classed as a comedy, even a dark one. Especially when a child is involved, there's nothing funny about that.However as an almost documentary of just how messed up people can get when having a breakdown, I think he nailed it.People are complaining the main character is not likeable, well of course he isn't, nobody is fun to be around when they are having a breakdown, that's the point. Its not who they are, its just how they are in that moment, when utterly broken. But look around the sets carefully, especially the house, there are clues all over that before all this he was a good father and it all went badly wrong. He loves his daughter but is completely unable to cope with the situation he has found himself in.I think the real flaws are leaving it up to the viewer to pick up on this, likewise we don't really understand what his wife is actually like, so its hard to know what to feel as things play out. But I think the idea is that neither is ""the bad guy"", they are just humans trying to cope in a messed up situation.That opening act sure is hard to watch but you absolutely need to watch this right to the end and watch carefully, to really pick up on all the details. The way every character in the movie is flawed is perhaps too realistic for some people, I can understand that, but I don't think it makes it a bad movie. It just expects you to go in more with an open mind, to think for yourself rather than having all the details spelt out for you. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression, having made some pretty messed up decisions (they didn't feel like something I had control over at the time) in my own life, I am able to understand what its like to feel like you have no control over your actions or life and have no idea what to do next.I wouldn't want to watch it a second time, its too depressing, but I do not regret seeing it once.",Thunder Road

Officer Jim is at a stage where this pressure can only be released by caving to into wild, knee-jerk reactions that can be suppressed no longer! I felt like this was a cathartic purge for and on behalf of other conscientious and fragile citizens. An allegory to remember to practice some self-care :)",Thunder Road
85,simonrosenbaum-11970,Undermined,4,9 September 2020,"It's a real shame because this could have been either a good comedy or a heartfelt drama. It wants to be both and ends up being neither. As with a lot of films made in the last few years there is no sense of proportion. The main character has problems as does most people but for some reason he behaves like no person on earth would ever do. This puts him at a distance from you because if a character behaves in an unbelievable and irrational way then the film is undermined and loses all credibility.
Maybe a better actor would have made it work but as talented as Cummings is he isn't Sam Rockwell. The only scene that worked for me was the very last one that was the only one that was real.",Thunder Road
86,chaouachiyoussef,Do not watch this movie. Do not even think about it!,4,14 January 2019,"I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this movie.
I dont see how people can love this movie : there is no story and no comedy in it.
Do not do the same mistake I did by watching this thing. Instead, you can do a lot of things in 90 minutes.",Thunder Road
87,ethancarmanmoore,Great directorial debut,9,16 May 2019,"Thunder Road is a 2018 movie that I only found out about recently and I'm glad I checked it out. Its director Jim Cummings' first feature. He also wrote, starred in, and scored the film. The plot is basic enough, a down on his luck guy who is trying to fight for his daughter's custody but what makes this film different from other forgetful messes is the filmmaking foremost. The direction, acting, shot composition, cinematography and writing are almost masterful which is extremely impressive considering this is a debut film.A 13 minute long take showcasing Cummings as Jim Arnauld eulogizing at his mothers funeral starts us off and I was immediately in it for the long haul. The humour is awkward, you pity our subject, while also feeling for him and his situation, but he just keeps digging himself in deeper - it's like watching a train wreck that you can't take your eyes off. While watching this opening I kept thinking ""Man, this scene would have made a great short film"" and it would you look at that - the film is based off of Cummings' previous short which is the same set up. The movie is made up mostly of long takes which gives a feeling of realness to the events taking place. Its also always nice to see them done well in a debut film because it can really give the cast moments to shine by showcasing their talents - on screen and off.Jim Cummings' performance is one of the best, and my favourite, of 2018. His character is this flawed yet comical cop who is striving to better his life and it's mostly himself who always gets in the way. That is not to say that his surroundings aren't contributing to his struggle. Cummings' plays this character with the right amount of heart and cringe. His interactions with other people, and even with himself, are hilarious yet within the same scene you can end up really feeling for him. The interaction between his goals and his own character is one of the most interesting aspects of the film. He's not some generic picture-perfect guy who is being oppressed by the people around him which results in his endeavours. No, there are plenty of situations in which he makes it worse through fault of his own shortcomings. He's really just an extremely entertaining character to follow and it's all thanks to the great performance and writing.The film is funny, endearing, cringe-worthy (in the best way), and above all great. A good debut film is usually something that has hints of the inexperienced filmmakers true talent but is not anything exceptional. This inkling of talent reveals the director's potential. The director will often expand on what shone through in their debut film and get rid of what didn't in their future films. Thunder Road on the other hand is already so impressive that if Cummings' tops himself next time I will be blown away. It does not feel like a low budget first time director's film. The shots, direction, writing and acting all feel so calculated as if he's been filmmaking for an entire career. Watch the trailer for this one and you'll immediately know if its something you're interested in watching. I highly recommend it.",Thunder Road
88,betyouarejunk,"A unique film that I wasn't expecting (some spoilers, noted before each section)",10,5 December 2018,"I had no prior knowledge of this video. I usually do not watch Indie films. I had read a brief statement about it and thought it was going to be funny so I decided to watch it. It starts out somewhat funny and has funny moments but it's much deeper and more dramatic than I expected it to be. I cried multiple times through out this movie. Though the character is a male and is going through different things than I have gone through, I could still feel his struggles, his pain, his inner fight, and his inner fight giving up. It was a story line that could, in a way, happen to any one of us. A series of things happening that are out of our control that build upon one another until we are no longer ourselves as our sadness is turning into anger. For anyone going through such feelings, please speak to someone. It is not good to bottle these things up and can cause a lot more trouble for you in the end than you are dealing with in the now.This movie seems slow. It does not have a lot of dramatic music moving it along and informing the viewer of the speed. It seems very melancholy. This is how it is suppose to feel. Some of the dialogue seems kind of odd but it seems more realistic than a lot of scripts. In real life we do not always word ourselves properly and sometimes we say things we probably should not have. Sometimes when we say what we are thinking, it comes out differently than what we were thinking. We are not a perfect script. Also, there were a couple of scenes that seemed to play absolutely no role in the story line and did make it somewhat creepy and kept me wondering how it was going to play out but it never played out.Overall, I recommend this movie a lot but I think everyone needs to go into this movie knowing exactly what to expect. It seems that many of the negative comments are from people that were expecting a full blown comedy and this is far from that. Yes, it has some comical moments but it is not listed strictly as a comedy. It is also listed as a drama,**SPOILER**
The soon-to-be ex-wife's death leads us to the conclusion that she was abusing drugs but I do not feel that that was alluded to anywhere else in the movie so it was a bit confusing. During one scene she does come off a bit trashy but not drug use. We do not know if Jim was aware of her drug use. At the end, it seems like he was not but at one point, after losing custody, he spoke to his sister about how the lawyer wanted to go after the soon-to-be ex-wife's character like they had a lot to use against her but at the first hearing he told the lawyer that he did not want full custody because he wanted his daughter to have a mom and the lawyer looked really confused. He spoke highly of his soon-to-be ex-wife.As I said, I cried a few times during this movie. The friendship that Jim has from his partner made me cry multiple times. His partner really just wanted to be there for his friend and wanted his friend to talk to him and get help. Even after Jim attacked him and accused him of ruining his life he still went over to his house for a planned poker night and when he saw how bad off Jim was he stayed and drank with Jim for a while. He truly felt Jim's pain and told his wife how much he loved her and when she picked him up, he was hugging on her.**SPOILER - BREAKDOWN**
So, the story is about a police officer who is going through a divorce when his mom passes away. He thought he was going to pay tribute to his mother at her funeral, which his brother and sister didn't even show up for, with a dance to Thunder Road by Bruce Springsteen, but his CD player did not work so he decided to go through with it without music and it became a circus. He is in his police uniform and immediately leaves the funeral to pick up his partner but it turns out that he was not suppose to be on the job. He was expected to take some time off to grieve but he did not want to. He was doing everything to avoid his feelings. His relationship with his daughter is awkward and she appears to not like spending time with him. His soon-to-be ex-wife files for full custody of his daughter and half of everything. She was also planning to move away with her new boyfriend. He sells his mom's dance studio that he was wanting to remodel and reopen to pay for an attorney to fight his soon-to-be ex-wife.During all of this, the trauma is weighing more and more on him but he refuses to open up about it even though his partner has been a really good friend to him and has tried to help him. His partner even through someone's phone in a lake who had recorded the scene at the funeral home. Unfortunately, that did not get rid of the video and it was shown in court to show Jim as violent and out of control. The judge took gave full custody to the soon-to-be ex-wife he went off and blamed his partner but it was far more than that. He was finally addressing everything. He lost his job because he did this at the police station and had pulled out his gun. While he was never really a threat during these moments of going off, here and during a parent-teacher conference, and he would even try to be polite while going off, he was still unstable. He then appears to give up on life. His partner stopped by his house for a poker night and found it a mess. He instead just had a day of the two of them drinking and just hanging out, which seemed to help them bond better. Jim then packs a bag to stay with his sister for a bit but seems to feel that he is an intrusion and does not ask to stay. His sister tells him some things about his mom and he learned that his mother hid her feelings and problems as well. He then goes to the cemetery and talks to his mom's grave.Towards the end, Jim is pulled over and gets out of his truck yelling telling him that he had not been drinking and asking why he was being pulled over. The cop tells him to check his phone. The banter goes back and forth as Jim is confused and the officer does not know the details. Jim had locked his keys in the truck when he jumped out. He tried punching the window out but it did not work. He asked the officer for a stick and seems very aggressive making it seem like he was about to hit the officer but he hit the window. He finally busts it open to find his phone is dead. In the mean time, the officer had been trying to get details and tells Jim an address, it is his soon-to-be ex-wife's address. The officer drives him to the home where he runs up to the door and his now ex-partner his holder his daughter as he's coming out of the door. He asked what happened, the ex-partner opens the door, Jim looks inside, and they close it back up. He finds out his daughter called the police and told her she did good but was sad that she did not call him. He has the daughter go with the ex-partner and he goes in. She had overdosed on drugs. He tells her how this hurt him the most out of everything she did and everything that was happening. He kissed her hand to say goodbye for him and his daughter then slapped her for all the problems she is going to have in the future.His ex-partner took the girl to an ambulance and when Jim came out of the house he told him that the chief was speaking with child services and giving a good reference so that he could take her home. He started to walk away and turned around to give him a hug. He goes and sees his daughter and decided they needed to get away. He asked her if she wanted to run away with him and she said yes. The final scene is Jim and his daughter going to see a ballet, his mother was a ballerina, and she's complaining that it will be lame. During the show she appears extremely interested in the ballet and Jim is happy.",Thunder Road
89,jamesedcollyer,Hilarious and Utterly Bleak,7,2 May 2019,"This movie manages to dance along a hair-thin line of goofy comedy and heavy drama with an amazing amount of skill and purpose. Tears of laughter can turn into sobs within a single scene and neither tone lessens the impact of the other, if anything the juxtaposition ends up making each more impactful.The film is both reserved and manic, funny and sad, dreamlike and intensely realistic and it pulls off each masterfully and with great purpose.The entire experience is held together by an incredible performance by Jim Cummings, a flawed yet endearingly genuine man who tries to keep his life together as everything important to him is taken. Cummings manages to make a unbelievably tragic story both profound and hilarious and he deserves every ounce of recognition he's getting.Unfortunately the other performances in the film were not quite at the same standard, and while the vast majority of the movie is following Jim, I found that many of the scenes featuring other characters had nowhere near the same impact as those featuring Jim on his own. Not to say that any of them were terrible, but any issues they did have were thrown into harsh relief by the performance of the lead actor.All in all this is a film that punches way above its budget and has shown Jim Cummings to be an incredible talent both behind and in front of the camera. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next.",Thunder Road

Just from a technical standpoint, it's a good tragic.On the other hand, it seems very odd to me that this would be classified as a comedy. I have read theories that this was done purely for marketing, which would be understandable. But I have read reviews of people describing the ""amazing cringe comedy"" and how they ""couldn't stop laughing"" which is just bizarre to me. There is a great number of ""comic"" scenes, in the meaning of ""weird"". A few of them are lighthearted and I can see someone cracking a smile during those. But most of them present real life problems that people with mental illnesses, such as the main character depicts, encounter and struggle with.To me, those scenes just added to the tragic: showing how intolerant society is towards people who don't completely fit the norm. But the frustrating thing is that apparently, this is in no way exaggerated from real life. Apparently, viewers also find it funny to laugh at characters who stand out in their struggle to live a normal life.",Thunder Road

This movie is a drama and is meant to pull the heartstrings. It does this pulling well.... eventually (read the rest). Most of the movie seems to be a show of how the main character has it going against him. The movie does, eventually (and I mean a long eventually), shows how the main character becomes the hero of the story to what's important. With that out of the way...Every character in this movie is gutter trash in one way or another. Enjoy the movie as a time waster and a, again extremely long eventual, heartstrings puller. The hero, the wife, the child, the boss, and every character in this movie, expect the dead mother, are all extremely horrible to each other.Horrible comedy, even as a dark one. Abysmal drama tbh.
