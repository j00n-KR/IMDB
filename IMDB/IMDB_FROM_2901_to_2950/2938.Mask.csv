0,MartinHafer,"""The movie is based loosely on Dennis' life, with most of the scenes and dialogue altered for dramatic purposes""...Wikipedia",7,21 June 2020,"One thing I sometimes avoid are Hollywood bio-pics. This is because rarely do the filmmakers ever allow the real story to come out but instead they embellish the crap out of it because they simply don't trust the truth nor the audience. This is definitely the case with ""Mask"", a film which is only very loosely based on the later years of Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz), a young man with a rare medical condition, Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia. Instead of just telling his story, they sanitized much of his life and made him inspirational...something very formulaic but which also take away from the guy's humanity. As a father with two disabled daughters, I take exception to this and just wanted to know the real Rocky and his life. What we do have is a nice inspirational film...but not exactly a true portrait (especially when it comes to Rocky's mother).The story is set in the last year or so of Rocky's life. He's in his final year at middle school and he has many of the typical problems a teen might have in addition to his medical condition. His mother (Cher) is loving and very appropriate in some ways...and a train wreck in many others.So is it any good? Yes...very much so. Despite playing fast and loose with some of the facts (such as having Rocky NOT being legally blind like he was in real life, never mentioning his brother and much more), the film is enjoyable and will keep your interest. Stoltz is quite nice in the lead (though Cher received top billing). He seemed to be able to do quite a bit as a young actor despite being under tons of makeup and prosthetics. The makeup by Michael Westmore and Zoltan Elek was pretty amazing and earned the Oscar for this category. And, the direction by Peter Bogdonovich was also lovely. No major complaints about anything other than the film taking too many liberties with the facts.",Mask
1,TheLittleSongbird,Achingly moving movie,10,15 October 2011,"I saw Mask because I like Peter Bogdanovich's films, and also it was on a subject that I identified with. I had been told so much about Mask, how moving and how great it was. And after eventually seeing it, having been behind with my movie watching, it fully lived up to expectations. Mask is a wonderful movie, very moving and Bogdanovich's second best movie after The Last Picture Show. Mask is beautiful to look at, with crisp cinematography and evergreen and autumnal images. The soundtrack is memorable and is careful not to be overpowering in key moments. The scripting is touching and honest, and the story has a subject that will resonate with anybody with a disfigurement, knows somebody with one or neither. More importantly, none of the film feels forced or in your face. Bogdanovich's direction is superb, and he sensibly focuses on mother and son's strengths and weaknesses. The two leads are superb. Whether it is her best performance or not is up for debate, but regardless Cher's performance is wonderful. That's not to dispute Eric Stoltz either, he is just heart-wrenching as he struggles with his disfigurements and faces death. Overall, Mask is such an achingly moving movie, and sadly one of the the 80s most overlooked films. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Mask
2,SnoopyStyle,wonderful sentimental inspirational movie,8,29 July 2015,"It's 1978 Azusa, California. Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz) has massive facial deformities. His biker single mom Rusty (Cher) registers him into the 9th grade. He's a happy well adjusted teen who dreams of riding motorcycles with his friend around the world. She's a force of nature. He excels in school academically. The surprised principal notices his tutoring jobs and gets him a counseling job at Camp Bloomfield for the blind. He falls for blind girl Diana Adams (Laura Dern). Gar (Sam Elliott) is a fellow biker who is in love with Rusty.This is a wonderful feel-good movie. Eric Stoltz is utterly charming. Cher is a great momma bear and Laura Dern is angelic. The puppy love is heart warming and heart breaking. The story is an inspirational tale and the actors make the movie even better.",Mask
3,mark.waltz,The mysteries of life never ceases to amaze me.,6,7 March 2019,"One of the biggest mysteries is why children are made to suffer, and hopefully in eternity we will find out that answer. Here, it is truly a great kid, Rocky Daniels, played with great compassion by Eric Stoltz. Rocky Daniels in real life suffered from a rare condition of an enlarged skull that was life-threatening and somehow, Rocky survived past day age of life expectancy, showing that had he not had this disorder, he would have grown up to be an incredible adult in spite of his family situation. Living with a single mother who prefers partying over providing, he nevertheless has an incredible attitude towards life and makes friends in spite of is presumed monstrous look.Research into the life of his situation, I have read various sources which described his mother, played here by Cher, as quite different than she is portrayed in the movies. But there is some evidence that he managed to learn something and that in spite of her flaws, his mother did something right. She is obviously a biker chick, hanging around with a tough motorcycle gang who in the screenplay is given multiple dimensions to avoid showing them in typecast manner.While he does not have the presence of unnatural father, Sam Neill is there as a father figure, going through several or deals in his efforts to win share back. The three of them deliver outstanding performances, with Cher look highly resembling what she would do upon her return to the pop charts over a decade later. Estelle Getty and Richard Dysart are briefly seen as Cher's parents and the antagonism between Cher and Dysart explains why her character became a bit of a rebel. Then there's Helen Hunt as the blind girl Rocky meets while working in a summer camp, giving him a case of love and shows how real love is not influenced by the physical.The film has more elements of a television movie then a big screen feature film, but then again so dead box office hits ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Steel Magnolias"". The theme of the human spirit being greater than the importance of physical beauty is a timeless one, and perhaps a better than average screenplay is why this made it to the big screen directed by Peter Bogdanovich. A confrontation between Stoltz and Cher over her personal life is quite powerful, as is Cher's reaction to his fate. It's a tough film to completely love because the main adult characters aren't personally appealing, but as for the real ""Rocky"" (Ray) Daniels, he gets a standing ovation today, nearly 40 years after he was given eternity to go anywhere he wanted to.",Mask
4,lee_eisenberg,face booked,10,30 September 2008,"Some articles or short biographies about Peter Bogdanovich that I've read assert that his career has not amounted to as much as it could have. His 1985 masterpiece ""Mask"" should disprove that. It tells the story of teenager Roy L. ""Rocky"" Dennis (Eric Stoltz), who suffered from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia that left him with an enlarged face. He and his biker mother Rusty (Cher) do what they can to live their lives normally, understanding that it will be an uphill climb.One of the impressive parallels is the relationships that they develop. Rusty is involved in a relationship with fellow biker Gar (Sam Elliott), and they're pretty much the same kind of person. Rocky attends the camp for the blind where he befriends Diana (Laura Dern); she can't see what he looks like, but she accepts him for being a nice person.So this is definitely one that I recommend. It not only shows the triumph of the human spirit confronting adversity, but affirms the talent of all parties involved. Really good.Also starring Estelle Getty, Richard Dysart and Harry Carey, Jr.",Mask
5,jboothmillard,Mask,7,26 November 2007,"If the lead actress was going to win an Oscar, it could have been for this, not Moomnstruck, because I preferred Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction much more. Anyway, this is the true story of Roy L.'Rocky' Dennis (a very convincing Golden Globe nominated Eric Stoltz), who suffered the extremely rare disorder Craniodiaphyseal Dysplasia, commonly known as Lionitis due to the disfiguring Cranial Enlargements that it causes. Obviously the story sees his journey through all the things a normal boy of his age would do, except it being with a not completely normal boy. Throughout the film, he collects cards, goes to school and achieves three graduation diplomas for his great skills (another thing that made him different), volunteers to help people in a camp, where he meets his true love Diana Adams (Laura Dern), and much more. His mother Florence 'Rusty' Dennis (Cannes Film Festival winner, and Golden Globe nominated Cher) is one of the problems in his life, she is a no nonsense mother with a drug habit and prostitution that sometimes stops him getting anywhere and can cause arguments, but he is happy when she is tender, protective and hanging out with her true love and good friend, Gar (Sam Elliott). Oh, in the film Rocky suffers many horrible head aches of some kind, and this is probably what killed him in the very sad ending. I didn't see the very ending, but I got the idea of how tragic his death was to his mother. Also starring Estelle Getty as Evelyn, Richard Dysart as Abe, Micole Mercurio as Babe, Harry Carey Jr. as Red, Dennis Burkley as Dozer, Lawrence Monoson as Ben, Ben Piazza as Mr. Simms, L. Craig King as Eric, Alexandra Powers as Lisa and Kelly Jo Minter as Lorrie. I can kind of associate with the story, I have a social problem called Asperger's Syndrome, it may cause problems in my social life and skills, but I do like the fact that in one of my schools, I became a student known by almost everyone in my final year (11), and the film story seems rather similar to mine in places, and it is a very good film. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm award for director Peter Bogdanovich. Very good!",Mask
6,ccthemovieman-1,Memorable Story But I Don't Like Cher,6,16 October 2006,"This was a heart-warming story of a teen with a deformed face. The story chronicles his life at school, and with his biker mom and her friends.The language in here and rough edge with Cher playing the mom all turned me off, even though the mom was soft inside. Sorry, but I don''t like hard women and Cher never appealed to me. Speaking of tough people, the obvious attempt at the making the Hell's Angels-type bikers as good-hearted softies were a little too much. Come on! It's almost as laughable as how Hollywood always portrays hookers as sweet, beautiful ladies. There are some really good-hearted Hells Angels, I suspect, but not as much as in here.Eric Stoltz is great as the kid with the lionesque face. There are many tender moments and difficult ones to watch as people either are wonderful or cruel (school kids) to Roy 'Rocky' Dennis (Stoltz).",Mask
7,moonspinner55,"Failed attempt at an old-fashioned, inspirational story told in a modern idiom",5,24 November 2002,"Woebegone dramatic true story of a young California boy with a rare disease which has disfigured his skull, his home-life with a hell-raising mother, and their biker-friends who provide moral support. Unattractive role for Cher as the stouthearted mom purports to show off her sass and charm, but there's no honest character there and Cher falls back on shtick (she's no Meryl Streep, but even Streep would struggle with this part). Despite being unrecognizable under the make-up, Eric Stoltz gives a forthright performance as the teen-aged Rocky Dennis; still, the picture is ready-built for tragedy and one almost gets defensive when heartstrings are jerked so early on in a two hour-plus film. Probably the oddest bit of casting: Estelle Getty as Cher's mom (!), also Sam Elliott as an aw-shucks biker with mustachio. Nobody here looks comfortable with what they're doing, and the cutesy undermining (courtesy of director Peter Bogdanovich, out of his element) is distracting. Yes, those biker boys are really just charming guardian angels, aren't they? What a lot of hogwash! ** from ****",Mask

9,evanston_dad,Even the Most Jaded Movie Goer Has to Choke Up at This One,8,8 April 2008,"Ugh, what a gut-wrenching movie this is.Peter Bogdanovich avoids the maudlin histrionics that could have marred this story about a young man suffering from a fatal disease that leaves him horribly deformed. Eric Stoltz is remarkable as the young man, Rocky Dennis, and it's entirely thanks to him, and to his charm as an actor, that we fall in love with Rocky and are heart-broken to see him die at the end. Cher is equally as good as his mom, who sees nothing ugly in her son and feels nothing but ferocious love for him.I will always remember a wonderful scene in this movie, in which Rocky is trying to explain colors to a blind girl (played by a lovely and young Laura Dern) and does so by giving her items to touch -- a hot potato for red, cotton for white, ice for blue.Grade: A",Mask
10,Aaron1375,Enjoyable movie chronicling Rocky Dennis and his last few month or so of his life.,8,30 October 2010,"This movie is the true story of a teen who is deformed named Rocky Dennis. I do not know how true it is, they usually change a lot of things around in Hollywood, but I am willing to guess a good portion of it is true with a few indulgences here and there to add some extra drama and stuff. I am guessing his friendship with the blind girl was made out to be more than it was. The make-up job was really good here as I saw a picture of the real Rocky Dennis and it is fairly close. The story follows Rocky through some events as you see how his daily life is up to a point. Nothing more to it than that really, you see how he is a rather smart guy with a likable personality. His mother, played excellently by Cher is a woman who loves her son, but it is thanks to her drug use that he was possibly born this way. Rocky tries to get his mom off the drugs using not so subtle means. Sam Elliot plays Gar, I believe his name was, a guy who is sort of a friend of Rocky's mom and a guy that Rocky seemed to look up to. The movie has some humor here and there and some drama too and quite a few scenes to make one feel a bit sad. A rather good film with generally good acting throughout the duration.",Mask
11,Sylviastel,Cher's best performance to date!,10,27 August 2002,"It's sad, depressing, and inspiring to watch this movie about a disfigured teenager and his wild mother played by Cher. It is the teenager who acts more like a parent to her. He is smart, brilliant, kind, generous, and has no many qualities lost by the tragedy. Cher's is untouchable and deserved to be nominated for an Oscar for this role. Even though there are times of sadness and tears, this movie will lift your spirits. There are also wonderful supporting performances by Estelle Getty who plays Cher's mother, Laura Dern who plays his blind girlfriend in one of the most touching love stories in recent film history, Sam Shepard as Cher's boyfriend in the film, Alexandra Powers, but one of the most moving and touching performances is by Eric Stoltz who is unforgettable in this movie. He should have been nominated for an Academy Award along with Cher. This film is truly a tear jerker. So bring your hankies!",Mask
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""This is beautiful""",9,9 September 2004,"Seriously, I did cry, but this wasn't an overly sappy film. I read in most of the comments that it was too sappy for some viewers. Yeah, you might cry, but rightfully. ""Mask"" is an excellent story. Rocky is a teenager who is very horribly disfigured. But he keeps his spirits up and just wants to fit in with the rest of the world. Cher plays his mother who is a biker chick. She loves him to death. And Rocky makes wonderful friends on the way through his life. It's a wonderful movie. I thought the story was very good and the actors were great. If you enjoyed movies like ""Powder"" or ""Huntchback of Notre Dame"", I think you would like this. I would highly recommend this film. Don't be afraid to cry.9/10",Mask
13,sddavis63,Deeply Moving And Wonderfully Cast,9,24 May 2008,"An excellent portrayal of the last year or so in the life of Rocky Dennis (played by Eric Stoltz), a teenager who lives with a hideously deformed face as the result of a rare disease. This is a movie that you cannot help but be pulled in by. It's funny in places, emotional virtually all the way through and bittersweet at the end. Rocky clearly had challenges to overcome - and not all of them revolved around his face. His mom Rusty (Cher) has a drug problem and has a poor relationship with her own parents, and he spends his time hanging out mostly with a rather tough looking group of bikers, at least some of whom are also into drugs. And yet, this is his world, and - for all their problems - these people are his family; they're the ones who accept him and love him unconditionally and look out for him. Seeing this relationship with the bikers (and especially the voiceless Dozer, played by Dennis Burkley) is almost as fascinating as anything else in the movie. Rocky has been told he doesn't have much time to live, but he does have dreams: a bike trip to Europe with a friend, and he wants to fall in love with someone. It's almost as if the dreams keep him going. He goes to a summer camp for blind children as a counsellor, and falls in love with Diana (Laura Dern) - a beautiful but blind girl who's able to see the beauty inside him. But then he goes home, and it all falls apart. His friend moves to Michigan, and the dream of Europe is gone; his new girlfriend's parents don't want her to have anything to do with him, and his dream of love is gone. With his dreams shattered, there's not much left for Rocky to look forward to. The shattering of his dreams is perfectly depicted by the scene in which he pulls the tacks off the map of Europe where he's been marking all the places he wanted to visit. You know it's happening, but the scene when his mom goes into his room and finds him dead in bed still can't help but put a few tears in your eyes.Director Peter Bogdanovich took a chance on casting Cher. She really didn't have much acting experience in 1985, but she pulled the part off very well (although given the circumstances in which Rusty lived, I thought Cher looked a little too good for the role.) Stoltz was convincing as Rocky, and Laura Dern was completely believable as the blind girl who falls head over heels in love with Rocky. Overall, though, I thought perhaps the strongest performance was Sam Elliott's as Rusty's sometime lover Gar. He looked the part, sounded the part and acted the part brilliantly.Apparently the movie takes a few liberties with Rocky's story. From what I understand, Diana didn't actually exist (although some think she may have been a composite of several girls in Rocky's life) and, while touching, the closing scene, where Rusty, Gar and Dozer visit the cemetery and Dozer puts flowers on the grave, is also a creation - Rocky's body was donated for medical research. There is no grave. Still, you can't help but be deeply moved by this absolutely engrossing story. It's well worth 9/10.",Mask
14,StrictlyConfidential,"Stoltz' ""Rocky"" Saves This Biker Gang Soap Opera",5,11 November 2018,"Without question - It was actor, Eric Stoltz' sincere portrayal of the American teen, ""Rocky"" Dennis (a boy whose face was grotesquely disfigured by ""lionitis"") who single-handedly held this seriously floundering picture together.Yep. Without Stoltz' solid and convincing performance (along with some truly excellent make-up effects) 1985's ""Mask"" was just a messy, little ""biker gang"" soap opera where Cher chewed up the scenery, threw idiotic tantrums, and, basically, played a total b*tch at every possible opportunity.And, speaking about the ""Turks"" biker gang - It really killed me how the whole lot of them were portrayed as being such good-hearted, little ""softies"" that they, literally, put the likes of the Boy and Girls Scouts of America to absolute shame.... Ha! Spare me!",Mask
15,ElMaruecan82,"The boy with the golden-heart, the mother with the steel character...",9,25 May 2020,"'Persona' is the Latin word for 'mask', conveying the paradox that what we are hides something about us more than it shows: this couldn't have been truer for anyone but Roy Dennis aka Rocky.""Mask"" is loosely based on the real-life story of a young boy affected by a face deformity coined by a complicated medical term while ""I look like a lion"" is the way he'd put it. But the film isn't much about the handicap than the way a teenager learns to deal with it at a time where boys his age think of having fun, discovering the world and meeting girls. The film is directed by Peter Bogdanovich and stars Eric Stolz and Cher as the central protagonists in performances so touching and authentic that I was wondering why the film only got a nomination for Best Make-up (that it won). ""Mask"", if anything, is a heart-warming, moving and absorbing story about a boy and his mother.Now I don't want to reduce Rocky Dennis to his handicap, but it is only too visible to sugarcoat it or pretend it doesn't exist, and that's what elevates his romance in the summer camp with the only person who could genuinely fall in love with him: a blind girl, played by a young Laura Dern. The romance gives its full meaning to the mother's words ""you're the most beautiful person inside"". Any mother would say that but from the interactions between Rocky and Helen, we know it's true and also because we know the mother isn't the right-way rubbing type. On that level, Cher doesn't go for the melodrama made-for-TV tearjerkers as Eleonor aka ""Rusty"" Dennis, she has her personal issues and an addiction with drugs that cause a few tantrums, in fact, she has a life of her own.Her character-establishing moment is a 'Mama Bear' rant right after the school principal objects to the admission of Rocky Dennis in junior high school suggesting one that would meet his 'special' needs'. In one brief but punchy little monologue, she says she knows her rights, insisting that her son is a good student and she has a good lawyer. But notice that the scene doesn't end here, the point isn't to inspire comments like ""yeah, way to go"" ""take that, principal"". The scene goes on with Rocky gently telling him that that he knows he looks weird but it'll be all right, and politely says goodbye. So, we know the stuff Rusty is made of and we realize that Rocky is not your typical rebellious teenager who'd answer to rejection in fatalistic misanthropia. And you can tell the principal sensed that immediately.And that simple moment sets a pattern that governs most encounters and interactions, people get quickly used to Rocky's looks. Some don't and they get 'rewarded' by Rusty's hangout friends, a group of bike-riding and rock-and-roll loving bikers, among them Gar, played by a charismatic Sam Elliott, the closest to a father figure to Rocky, and to a husband to Rusty. It gives a sweet irony that people who are regarded as hoodlums give Rocky that affection he needs, as it could only come from social outsiders. But the film is beyond the social comment and the leather-and-bike element is just to show the environment where he grew up, far from the suburban comfy lifestyle but certainly the protective shield he needed,We first see Rusty's friends kicking out one of her lovers after he couldn't hide his shock when he discovered Rocky's face. Later, the biggest biker (who never speaks ... until the emotional outcome) hears some students leaving a few wisecracks on Rocky's back and give them the walk of scare. Later, Gar gives a death glare to a carny who didn't want to give Rocky his ticket for the bumper cars. These moments show that for all the defense mechanisms Rocky built over the years like 'pretending to be an alien, self-derision, making his students laugh, there are people over there who won't miss an opportunity to reduce him to his face, and the worst part is that it doesn't just come from immature bullies but well-educated citizens.Indeed, one of the saddest moments of the film occurs when Rocky meets Helen's parents and has a direct taste of the rejection his condition immediately inspires, especially from upper people. Later, where he's got one joke too many, he grabs a student by the collar, pushes him on his locker saying ""I will take my masks off if you tell yours"", even his good nature can't endure more than what it can take. ""Mask"" doesn't preach a hymn for tolerance but invites us to appreciate people beneath their façade. It's a film that deeply resonated in my mind as a kid because I used to be scared by abnormality, burnt faces, handicaps, I couldn't stand images of suffering and watching ""Mask"" was quite a challenge.After the first five minutes I stopped watching Rocky as the face but as the kid who collects baseball cards, listen to rock music, studies well in school and plans a road trip in Europe. But I remember the TV teaser that only showed pictures and his voice in voice-over, I didn't know what the film was about and I think that Ebert and Siskel were right in criticizing the attitudes of the studios that advertised the film without showing the face, making it an object of curiosity à la ""Elephant Man"", they almost defeated the purpose of the film: to see the mask first only to realize that personality is what matters.Because that's the power of the story, once you get to know Rocky, his face ceases to get in the way of your personal appreciation, he's just a brilliant, smart, easy-going, good-mannered and sweet kid with one hell of a mother.",Mask

17,sol-,My brief review of the film,6,25 September 2005,"There are a number of interesting things in this film, and enough to bring it well above average, even if not enough to fully compensate for all of its problems. The characters are often seen via mirrors, which are devices for filtering reality and perceptions, such as what is perceived as beautiful. The film also says some things about perceptions with the bikies, who are depicted as loyal and caring, rather than the typical violent image that they carry. Eric Stoltz's performance is interesting, if not brilliant, as the makeup limits his facial expressions, so he has to use his voice and body for most of his acting. Our perceptions of his character change during the course of the film, as we become more accustomed too his face. However, his character is far too likable to be realistic, and even if based on true events, his superior intelligence and pure optimism feel like devices for causing us to like him, in spite of his 'lack' of beauty. The film goes through the motions, with nothing much that is not predictable. In the end, it also goes off on a tangent with a ""love conquers all"" message overtaking what it has to say about perceptions. The love interest in the film also prevents it from reinforcing ideas about overlooking beauty on the surface. There are at least a few more things that I could pick on here, but there are also a few more things that I could praise. In short though, 'Mask' is a good film despite its drawbacks. It is by no means perfect, but there is a lot of interest going on in it.",Mask

22,eric262003,A Truthful True Story Throughout,9,22 September 2008,"It's easy to point out that this story is based on actual events once the cameras start rolling. It is also backed up by excellent performances by Cher and Eric Stoltz. ""Mask"" is a tender, heart-warming story of a young teenager named Rocky Dennis who is very intelligent and emotionally sensitive as well. However, he is scarred badly due to a rare disease that has disfigured his face since he was born. As always people who pass him by or approach him a first glance feel slightly intimidated by his deformity. But by not letting these fears get to him, he becomes well over with his peers as they learn to accept him for who he is, not by what he looks like. Rocky also gets a boost of confidence from his mother, Rusty Dennis, played with sheer excellence by Cher. Rusty is a gorgeous, single mother with problems of her own too. She spends most of her time hanging around with biker gangs, she drinks, smokes, is addicted to drugs, but in spite of her problems, she continues to love her son and will bend over backwards to defend him from anyone who puts him to a lesser degree. For example, when the school principal who recommended that her deformed son be placed in a ""special"" school and how she told him off to his face that he will thrive with the normal students and threatened to sue him, shows that her love for her son will always be first before her. But with his progress and his strong academic showings, Rocky graduates as valedictorian of his class.Ever since he was born, Rusty delivered tough love towards her son, not to the point where he'll suffer a nervous breakdown, but just as way to keep him motivated and to blend in with people his own age like as though he was a normal child, without taking advantage of his deformity. And Rocky continued that legacy, from the morning he wakes up to face the world, inflate his self-confidence, keeping the glass half-full and just be happy with the world around him in what little time he has on this Earth. And eventually through tiring persuasion to get his mother to clean up her act, the audience finds more ways to love Rocky for what he really is. You love him because Rocky is a kid who loves people back which to this day is a precious commodity that you rarely see these days.I have seen ""Mask"" many times and every time I watch the movie, tissue paper is never behind. It is a coming-of-age story that deals with triumphs and failures of having an incurable disease and is handled in a believable and sensitive approach. But the great center in the story is not entirely centered on the kid's physical illness, but the bonding between a mother and her son.",Mask
23,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A timeless movie with a powerful message,9,24 December 2014,"Rocky is your average teenager; he loves baseball cards, dreams of traveling and has a loving mother. His mother's name is Rusty and she's a member of a biker gang. She's a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails woman but the exact opposite when it comes to Rocky; he's everything to her and she wants him to have every advantage to enjoy life even if other people just don't care. And one more thing... Rocky's life is supposedly on the line because he's severely deformed, with a facial skull deformity... so maybe he's not exactly your average teenager but he's no less of a person. He's extremely intelligent and kind towards everyone, and he loves his biker gang friends. After being enrolled in high school, this movie shows his complicated and dysfunctional yet adventurous and fun life, until something tragic happens that makes all people who were helped or affected by Rocky realize just how special he was.Mask is what movies today should be. When I walk past the movie theater and see titles like The Hunger Games (ugh, The Hunger Games is cr*p), I think back to powerful movies like Mask and wonder where they went. These days movies are all about cheaply making some fast cash, not telling an amazing story. Mask had actors like Cher (Cher is a singer also known for her roles in movies like Silkwood and Mermaids). Eric Stoltz did an outstanding job, one of the best acting jobs I've seen in some time (although my favorite actor is William B. Davis from The X-Files). It can't be denied that the plot of Mask is imaginative, with an original plot that movie producers today would probably just overlook. The soundtrack was great; it's not that annoying pop or dubstep music and it fits the movie's story.Anyway, please don't pass this movie up for some other garbage like The Hunger Games or Frozen, because Mask is a movie with a message that everybody needs in life: don't judge a person based on outside appearances, have a look inside their life first and then reevaluate your own life, see how much you take for granted every day. This is a movie everyone should see at some point and I'd stick by it over the crud coming out in theaters now any day.",Mask
24,Howlin Wolf,Meet life head on.,10,27 June 2007,"I happen to believe that Peter Bogdanovich is an astonishingly undervalued director. Those who feel it worthy to mention him at all usually hand out praise to ""The Last Picture Show"", but his output since that milestone - such as this and ""The Thing Called Love"", for example - undeservedly gets lost in the shuffle.In each of his films I have seen, Bogdanovich displays an extraordinary level of intimacy and comfort with his characters. We get drawn into their struggles because they are shown to us as fully fleshed-out human beings, not because manipulative elements like the score instruct us how to feel, at what time. He is able to draw our attention neatly to the vulnerability that exists inside everyone, regardless of external appearances. Such an ability is crucial to ""Mask"" and its overwhelming success in making us care about what happens.Particularly good is how deftly the fierce bond between mother and son is illustrated. As I was once a disadvantaged child myself, I know that what makes a good parent isn't always signalled by a cheerful disposition, but instead security comes from the knowledge that you have always been loved. Whatever may be on her list of faults, you are never allowed to dismiss the love she has for her kid.So, if you're looking for a journey over sometimes bumpy terrain that never forgets about the joyous qualities in life, then ""Mask"" would be it. It's amazingly affecting and is further demonstration of Bogdanovich's wonderful artistic gifts.",Mask

Sam Elliott turns up as her on-again boyfriend and surrogate father to Rocky (he doesn't really have to act, he just has to be a gruff, masculine presence), and a very young Laura Dern is the blind girl who loves him; the special-needs camp at which they meet is such a paradise it's hard to accept. You know where it's going, and it's a bit too heart-tugging for its own good, but I did stay with it, for over two hours, till after 3 a.m. The sentimentality is well placed, at the right moments, and a rocking soundtrack helps.",Mask

Considering that some of the movies in the 80's about people suffering from different kinds of sickness were good (""Rain man"" , ""My left foot"") I decided to give it a shot. It was a good decision.This movie never becomes too sentimental , too sappy or cheesy . It never tries to manipulate viewers emotions . It doesn't offer you empty optimism or pointless depression. ""Mask"" feels like a real life. It's bittersweet . Everything here seems natural , just like you're not watching a movie , but real life. Our hero has problems , yes , but he faces them without fear and with a bit of humor.""Mask"" balances humor and drama really well . The scene with the mirror is simple , yet very effective . This movie teaches us to treat people like Rocky just normal human beings and not to judge only by appearance. The uplifting message feels right . Sure , life is hard , but it shouldn't stop anyone from having dreams , ambitions and feelings- from living , no matter how short our life is.Good performances from Cher , Eric Stoltz and Sam Elliott . Watch out for Steve James (""American ninja"") and Andrew Robinson (""Cobra"") in small episodes as doctors and for Estelle Getty (""Stop or my mom will shoot"") as Cher's mother.

29,Isaac5855,A Feel Good Tearjerker...,8,24 December 2008,"MASK is the 1985 comedy-drama based on the true story of Rocky Dennis, a sensitive and highly intelligent teenager who, because of a debilitating disease, has a severely disfigured face that has made him an outcast outside of his family and the social circle surrounding them (basically a biker gang, who are savagely protective of Rocky). The film focuses primarily on Rocky's relationship with his mother Rusty (Cher), a free-spirited independent woman whose history of drug and alcohol abuse and sexual promiscuity has been such a concern to Rocky that it's sometimes hard to tell who's raising who in the Dennis household. The film is basically unfolds as a series of vignettes, highlighting the ups and downs of Rocky and Rusty's relationship, which seems to rise above everything else that happens in their lives. No matter what Rocky and Rusty go through, their love for each other rises above everything and makes all their fallacies fade to the background. Peter Bogdonovich's evocative direction is a big plus here, knowing where to mine the laughs and the tears and the film contains plenty of both. Cher gives the performance of her career as Rusty Dennis (even better than her Oscar winning turn in MOONSTRUCK) and an unrecognizable Eric Stoltz hits all the right notes as the soulful and intelligent Rocky. Sam Elliott is solid as Rusty's on-again, off-again boyfriend Gar and Laura Dern shines as a blind girl who Rocky falls for. Mention should also be made of Dennis Burkley as a slow-witted family friend and of Richard Dysart and the late Estelle Getty who register in one scene as Rusty's parents. Don't miss this lovely emotional drama that perfectly blends laughter and tears to maximum effect.",Mask
30,oOoBarracuda,"""You take their money, you gotta take their $hit""",6,27 May 2016,"If you need a dose of ""take no crap from anyone"", then Mask is the film for you! Cher is splendid alongside Eric Stoltz in the story of a boy with a serious facial deformity navigating his way through life, in spite of his appearance, with the constant albeit unusual support of his single mother. Leave your expected notions of a campy 80's movie at the screen; despite the film's 1985 release date, Mask is a beautiful story of self-love and acceptance with director Peter Bogdanovich able to avoid all classically cheesy 80's film clichés. The film's tough talking, pull no punches mother Florence 'Rusty' Dennis (Cher) has a son that she is, from a distance, extremely overprotective of. Roy L.'Rocky' Dennis (Eric Stoltz) was born with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, a sclerotic bone disorder leaving his face badly disfigured. Rocky was able to overcome his disability with a positive disposition and by using his intelligence to his advantage. Using his good sense of humor and positive outlook on life along with his mother's motorcycle companions protecting him, Rocky made friends and was a standout at school for his academic pursuits. Rusty is determined to meet every naysayer with the proof that her son can do anything any other child can do if given the chance; and she will ensure that he is given the chance. Based on a true story of overcoming prejudice and accepting the self, Mask is a beautiful film that would benefit all to see.I had never before seen a film starring Cher, I didn't even know she had acting credits, so watching her in Mask was an interesting surprise. She mastered her role with such grace. She perfectly executed her characterization of the gruff protective mother in such a believable and endearing way that you couldn't even be mad at her for doing drugs or hiring a hooker for her son. Rusty was the only ally Rocky had that had been there with him from the beginning, making Mask a perfect edition to mother month. The Grandfather of the film reminded me of Jack Nance, and I so wish it was him. Being a big fan of David Lynch I wish he was in more things; although I was pleased to see that Laura Dern had a role. This was a good film to see at this point in my life. Still reeling from my recent breakup, I can see the clear distinction in the change of character from before Rocky became interested in love to after he had been afflicted by love. Maybe the purpose of the movie is that a mother's love is the only love you need; somehow, I doubt that's the message but that's what I'll stick to while I continue to nurse this broken heart.",Mask

It's as if someone simply took a camera and filmed a slice of life.  Yet incredibly, the film avoids the ""feel"" of a documentary.  Also incredibly, the film somehow avoids making Rocky Dennis' deformity the central theme, and shows how someone with a severe and disfiguring disability can live very much of a normal life, given a good attitude and some positive hopes and dreams.Acting performances are incredible all around, but for one exception: Laura Dern.  How and why she's still acting is beyond me.  Both Cher and Eric Stoltz turn in absolutely incredible performances, especially Cher. Generally I dislike her in movies, but this one was the exception.If you haven't seen ""Mask"" and you enjoy movies about the good and the bad in everyday life (e.g. ""Ordinary People""), ""Mask"" comes highly recommended. 9/10.",Mask
36,supermaggie,The true wonder,10,22 March 2020,"This movie is one of the clearest examples of how awesome Hollywood once was (and the 80s were, sorry, yes, everything was better in the past) when it was still focusing on stories and characters instead of political propaganda. A film in which one is simply blissful / watched blissfully until the horribly sad, even if not surprising and realistic, end, because this is really food for the brain, the heart and the soul. And fabulously played by everyone, and of course particularly by Cher, which I also found stunning in Moonstruck, but which also shone here and in Silkwood - with all her shortcomings: having a mother like that is a dream, and also having friends like these. And because I read this in a review: yes, a seeing girl would have fallen in love with Rocky as well, because he has a wonderful character, like his mother never gets tired of pointing out. Therefore well-meaning but terribly lame modern-day films like Wonder (the comparison suggests itself) can only blush. And it is also great that there is no need for a real villain, no single student is exposed to hatred as the bad bully, but instead a memorial to (besides Rocky of course) the love and strength of the friends and the mother is established - this is how a statement of tolerance and against prejudice is set, so the movie is political in a way, but in a natural, positive way, that's how it is / was done - unfortunately I think such times will never come back again. Such film art was the true wonder.",Mask

Eric Stoltz also gives a hell of a performance as Rocky Dennis, the teenager who's head is a weird shape because of a growth problem. When Rocky finally gets accepted into a school and does really well, his Mom and friends give him a massive cheer and applause! Touching stuff. Sam Elliot gives great support as Rocky's mom's fella. Rocky later meets Diana, a beautiful blind girl and romance blossoms. When Rocky teaches Diana how to 'see' through touch she is delighted at her new way to see and this has to be one of the most beautiful scenes ever committed to camera in a movie.

43,dav07dan02,good story about a boy's disfiguring disease,7,16 August 2005,"Director: Peter Bogdanovich, Script: Anna Hamilton Phelan, Cast: Cher, Eric Stoltz, Sam Elliott, Laura DernThis is a film that I well remember from the 1980's but not one I think about when I am out buying DVD's. I just happened to come across a director's cut at our local Hastings store. This movie is about a boy or young man really that was born with a congenital cranial disease that resulted in him having a severely disfigured head and face. We are shown some of the prejudices he had to face and how he copes with his disease. The actors give a very strong performance in this film. The acting and the sound track are among the reasons why this film has stayed with me after 20 years. Bogdanovich does a good job bringing out emotion in his actors. He also does well in creating the 'blue collar' feeling in this film with bikers,canned Shlitz beer etc. It was all this that helped keep this from being a sappy film. I have read that Bogdanovich and Cher did not get along during much of the filming of this picture. It all worked out in the end because Cher gives one of if not her best performance as 'Rusty', Rocky's mom. She is portrayed as this drug using, beer drinking, biker mom on welfare(probably,the film doesn't actually tell us) that she pulls off very well. Even though she doesn't exactly live a conventional life style, she really does care for her son and treats him as if he doesn't have a disease. Eric Stoltz also did excellent as her son 'Rocky'. I heard in the commentary that it took some four hours each day to put all the make-up on. He actually wore this out in public so he could get a real idea about what the real Rocky had to endure. Laura Dern, in an early performance, played a blind girl by the name of Diana. Rocky meets her at a camp for the blind that he worked at as a counselor and they fall in love only for him to be a victim of prejudice by her parents. This was a very early film for both Stoltz and Dern. We cannot forget the ever cool Sam Elliott as 'Gar'. A tough biker and Rusty's old flame and father figure to Rocky. The DVD that I have is a Director's cut. It has some scenes that were not in the original theatrical release. The biggest difference however is in the soundtrack. Songs by Bob Seger were substituted with Bruce Springsteen. Apparently, this was the original idea but they were not able to use Springsteen's music originally due to royalty conflicts with the songs publisher (I guess). Bogdanovich and Springsteen are friends so when they were preparing for a new DVD release, they were now able to use Springsteen's music. Also, the real Rocky was a Springsteen fan. I do like Bruce Springsteen but I thought Seger's music was more suited for this film.",Mask

50,Cherubin,one of the most profound movies ever made,9,23 February 2001,"I have been wanting to write a review of this movie for a long time because it made a major impression on me. Although I heard that there were many differences between the real life Rocky Dennis and his movie counterpart and in spite of melodrama and some cloying touchy feely cuteness , ""Mask"" often feels like real life , which can be both comforting and disturbing, especially considering that real people can and did have the disease presented in the movie (with frighteningly realistic makeup). Nevertheless, the movie really does go the extra mile. Cher and Eric Stoltz give the impression that they actually BECAME the characters. I almost disbelieved it was them although I saw other movies of theirs. The characters were three dimensional and the script was simply great, offsetting the heaviness of its subject matter with a surprisingly effective sense of humor. Rocky´s problems, social, physical and otherwise, were presented in a well balanced context that never wallowed in the problems but did not trivialize them either. In the end, it delivered the message that your problems are only as big as you make them as long as you never give up in pursuing your goals. To be sure, Laura Dern here is as mousy and awkward as in most of her other movies and Sam Elliot is mostly just there to look cool but all in all, this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10. It is sad on a macro level, cheerful on a micro level, and all around unforgettable.",Mask
51,gunslinger861,movies like this don't come around very often,10,13 January 2010,"I saw this movie when i was 15. it just absolutely blew me away. from the amazing acting,to the beautiful score by bob seger,even down to the make up effects.Having seen pictures of the real rocky dennis,the make up job was absolutely dead on.The movie concerns rocky dennis. A boy who despite being born with a disease that has left his face horribly disfigured,is an extremely intelligent,kind,and outgoing young man. Rocky lives with his mother who is a hard living biker. Yet through her troubles she genuinely loves her son. There is also gar,a biker who treats rocky as if he were his own son.At the beginning the odds are stacked against rocky but through love and perseverance,he emerges as an inspiration to all around him.This film is an absolute triumph. However it is a major tear jerker. i think sometimes we need those kinds of films ,and a reminder that nothing is impossible. That no matter how high the odds are stacked one can emerge on top. I really related to his relationship with gar. i have always considered myself an outsider,but when i was 14 my step dad came into my life and took me as his son despite my flaws,much like gar did with rocky. Rocky also falls in love with a blind girl who even though she is blind,she loves rocky for who he is. the film is flawless,and the song by bob seger at the end credits is just perfect. I love this film and think everyone should see it. Also for the fact that it makes us look at ourselves,much like the elephant man did 5 years earlier. Instead of us looking at how we treat those who are different,it makes us look at ourselves in a much different way.That everyman has his burden to carry in life, regardless of if its mental,physical,or spiritual we all do. That appearance means nothing, beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder and if rocky dennis isn't a shining example of that then nothing is. Fair warning however. As wonderful as this film is the rocky dennis face could be frightening to small children. Great story with a great message. 10 out of 10",Mask
52,Vancity_Film_Fanatic,A triumph in storytelling.,9,19 February 2005,"Definitely one of the best films made in 1985; Peter Bogdanovich's ""Mask"" is an engrossing character study on the life of Rocky Dennis, and the somewhat tumultuous but always loving relationship he shared with his mom Rusty. Tragic, touching, inspirational  the movie succeeds in proving the importance of maintaining a positive attitude despite life's adversities. Bogdanovich masterfully draws stunning performances from all of the principle players. With several noteworthy scenes throughout the film where Cher shines, it's no surprise she won the best actress trophy at Cannes for her role as Rusty; effectively depicting a loving mother who is incredibly strong willed, yet also lost and vulnerable. No other actress would have made the portrayal so gut wrenchingly real  it's a shame she wasn't awarded the Oscar as well. Eric Stoltz, Sam Elliott, and Laura Dern are also magnificent. The incredible acting by everyone involved really makes this film such a rewarding and worthwhile experience, with the viewer being taken on an intimate journey through the lives of every day people facing extraordinary circumstances. If possible, see the original version with the Bob Seger soundtrack  the re-release DVD contains only the Springsteen soundtrack; which one would have expected a Director's Cut edition to have both choices. Having seen the original so many times, I opted to hunt down the now out-of-print original theatrical release by Image Entertainment for my collection. Not to be missed by anyone with an interest in true life stories. Highly recommended  a 9/10.",Mask
53,croutonsofdeath,Mask is a rare gem of its genre.,9,27 February 2009,"There are lots of these films. Generally, these ""Feel good/inspirational films"" try so hard that they end up making you feel sick. Often they go above and beyond the reality and overplay something so insignificant, its hard to relate to it. Mask does neither. Mask is grounded in reality. Yes, some of the facts are skewered, but it lives in the real world. It feels realistic and it feels relatable. Another thing Mask does differently is how it spreads its ""Inspirational"" message. Many of these films just give the message straight up, with no spice or seasoning to make it interesting. Or they might just toss it in your face at the beginning and forget it, letting it sit in your face throughout the movie, often making it more uncomfortable than inspiring. Mask uses subtly and lets the story itself unfold its message. The direction is tight and conveys this beautifully. There is a scene that always touches me- when Rocky is looking in a fun house mirror. At first we do not see what he sees, but he goes to get his mother. She looks into the mirror, and the fun house mirror shows Rocky but without his facial disorder. It's a beautiful, somewhat haunting, scene.The film is the true life story of Roy ""Rocky"" Dennis, a boy born with a disease commonly known as ""Lionitis"" that deforms the cranial growth. His mother, played surprisingly well by Cher, is short tempered and morally questionable, but is ultimately determined to help Rocky live as good a life as normal.The ultimate message of the film is not to be shallow. It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside, it's what is inside, what is behind the ""mask"" if you will, that counts. The movie conveys its message well, and Rocky's character does a good job of delivering that message. Rocky was intelligent, nice, funny, and caring. Sure he has his faults, but once again thats the film actually staying in the realm of reality. Rocky is a likable- if not lovable character despite his originally off putting appearance.Mask is something we don't see in cinemas anymore: An ""inspirational"" true story that doesn't force it and ultimately, succeeds in making you feel good and even tugs your heart strings a bit. So many films try to do this but fail, but we should be thankful we have Mask. One of the most beautiful and touching films ever made.",Mask
54,gordon-31,A fine film about disability.,8,24 June 2000,This is a fine film about disability and how people around the disabled person readily accept him into their group. Casting is excellent and Cher is superb. A very thoughtful film.The film portrays a motorcycle gang and it shows that tough people can be very considerate and kind too.,Mask
55,dukestwinpack,Cher in a wonderful performance,10,7 December 2000,"Eric Stoltz plays Rocky Dennis, a teen afflicted with a horribly disfiguring disease. He lives with his mom, Rusty (Cher), a sometime junkie who pals around with a gang of bikers.Between coping with his mom's antics, dealing with the prejudice he encounters and the debilitating migraines he suffers from, Rocky still manages to win over his teachers and classmates, becoming an inspiration to them.While the story initially seems to be about Rocky, it's also about Rusty. She wants everyone to see her as the tough biker chick who can handle anyone and anything that comes her way, including Rocky's disease and the strangers who stare. This is her mask. She's really scared to death for Rocky and turns to the alcohol and drugs to help her cope.A great film based on a true story, Mask will convince you that sometimes the most unlikely people become heroes.",Mask
56,tctill,"Almost ruined in the middle, but bounces back",6,6 February 2005,"I was relieved to find that Peter Bogdanovich's 1985 film ""Mask"" was in no way the ultra-depressing somber fest I envisioned it to be. Paying only vague attention to the movie when it began to air oh-so-creatively on FX one day, I quickly grew absorbed in the life of Rocky Dennis, the extremely deformed (his skull is large and mishapen due to ""lionitis"") teenage main character (wonderfully portrayed by Eric Stoltz) -- a very likable and easygoing guy who hardly let the rudeness that came his way affect him. Hence, most characters in the movie liked Rocky. Nobody made a freak show out of him, which was relieving and a definite plus!I even tolerated Cher in the first half hour or so (she plays Rocky's tough, drug-struggling mother Rusty) and her motorcycle-gang pals. The biker character Bulldozer, who ""doesn't like to talk"", was very appealing. Sam Elliott was also quite good as a love interest of Rusty and father figure to Rocky. I enjoyed seeing Rocky interact with this special group of friends, and I grew excited with him when he planned his trip through Europe with another teenage boy. Cher's Rusty just had a strange appeal in the first part of the film; the way she didn't take any ""b.s."" from the principal of Rocky's school (who tried to condescendingly suggest he go to special school) was admirable and root-for worthy.However, in the middle of the movie, when Rocky started to develop an interest in girls -- and more specifically when Rusty turned to drinking and drugs -- ""Mask"" took a turn for the worse. I regret to say that the Rusty character became very boring very fast, and that far too much time was spent on her. That first time I watched it, I couldn't even make it to the end of the film. It literally put me to sleep! BUT ... one day, when I noticed that ""Mask"" was once again playing on FX, I decided to give it another chance. I tuned in just as Rocky was going off to a camp for blind kids, and, thankfully, discovered that ""Mask"" lifted itself out of dullness as soon as its main character was the focus again and not his mother. I don't usually think Laura Dern is some genius actress like many seem to, however the romance portrayed between her character Diana and Stoltz' Rocky is very sweet. I especially liked the scene when Rocky taught Diana colors and textures in a camp kitchen, using a hot potato for ""red"" and some cotton for ""billowy."" Diana's parents turn out to be the ones who treat Rocky the worst in ""Mask"", but their discomfort IS admittedly realistic.If you get bored by the middle, hang in there. All in all, ""Mask"" is a film worth watching! I haven't seen it in awhile, but I look forward to seeing it again... particularly after becoming acquainted with Jens Lekman's song 'Rocky Dennis's Farewell Song to the Blind Girl', which is an absolutely beautiful love song and a perfect companion to this film.",Mask
57,dtburr,A Real Classic,8,24 July 2005,"Casablanca. Gone With the Wind.Mask? Well, Peter Bogdonavich isn't exactly a no-name director. Give him a great screenplay and you might just be surprised. I am no big Cher fan, as applies to her acting, but in my opinion it was her best performance ever. Same with Eric Stoltz (Rocky). Stoltz has been doing his thing for 30 years and I have never seen one of his characters that wasn't believable. The guy is ""uber-talented"" and a true professional. This was tough role. He didn't act from *behind* the mask - he had to act *through* the mask. That requires acting at another level of complexity.Sam Elliot (Gar) was believable for me as Cher's (Florence's)love interest and a biker leader. Some may say that all that biker stuff was over the top. I found it convincing. Bikers can seize on a cause with the jaws of a pit bull and be relentless in their support. This was, to me, a really believable situation.The Diana character (Laura Dern) was very welcome and sweet, but I do have a hard time believing that she had not been exposed to some of the concepts that Rocky worked on with her (colors and shapes). She came across as too smart for this stuff to have been a new concept, especially after seeing her parents, who did not seem to be idiots. At the same time, the parents were TOTALLY unbelievable characters. Their daughter, who they obviously love, has a disability, but they are totally repulsed by Rocky and his. It rarely works this way in real life.I do have to sum up with this: If at the end of the movie you did not cry - with real, liquid tears that you could feel with your hand, then you need to call the police right now and turn yourself in as at least a potential (if not actual) serial killer. Just sit on the steps of the front porch and wait for them to get there. Unless you're a certified something-or-other, is simply NOT POSSIBLE to watch the whole movie, and see the ending scene where Cher comes into Rocky's room after finding out he wasn't at school, and not get swept up into that emotion.",Mask
58,dakki78,A touching tale,9,15 March 2006,"I saw the movie ""Mask"" for the first time when I was only about 10 years old, but already at that tender age the movie really moved me. A story like no other, the story of Rocky Dennis is one that everybody should see or read if you are a bigger fan of books than movies.Now I once again saw the movie some 15 years later, and even though many years had passed I still remembered almost every detail about the movie. That in my book really explains how great this movie is. I am very careful when it comes to calling movies masterpieces, but this one indeed is.I loved the movie when I was a kid, I love it now as an adult. So in other words it is a movie for all ages, and I truly believe that you don't have to be a fan of drama movies to enjoy this one. It has that something for everyone!",Mask
59,Pookiebooz,"Very sad, very uplifting, very good movie",9,14 September 2005,"Watch this movie. It is great. And it is the only ""Cher"" movie I like (well, I kind of enjoyed Mermaids too). Cher's character can be very unlikable, especially when Rocky is trying to read his poem to her and she is just trying to get ready to ""go out"" and ignoring him and being a rude bad mother. But for some reason for the most part you still like her. Eric Stoltz is awesome! So is Sam Elliot (I wouldn't mind riding on the back of a motorcycle with HIM!) I'm sure the real Rocky Dennis put up with more abuse from his peers than portrayed in this movie but the point wasn't to show all that all the time. He was well loved and a great person. He was stronger than a lot of us. I also thought it was interesting that this movie has no musical score whatsoever, the only music you hear is what the characters are listening to(I also love that Bob Seger music). I highly recommend it.",Mask
60,ecspringer-84759,An Excellent Performance For Every Cast Member,10,22 August 2021,"Mask is a very touching story about a boy named Rocky Dennis, and no other actress could have pulled off playing the mother of this child but Cher.Cher had only done a few movies up to this point, she had been very successful on The Sonny & Cher Show, which combined music and comedy, with big celebrity guest stars, but Cher had done movies as I previously mentioned, but this was the film that really shows Cher's dramatic side, and she pulled it off quite well!Sam Elliot was one who hadn't done very many movies himself, but this film showed he could play not only a tough gut, but a tough guy with a heart of gold, his character Garr basically shows he was really the only father Rocky ever had. Garr is just as important to the film as anyone is in it, and Sam Elliot played well off of Cher, making them a great team!Eric Stoltz deserves the most credit, since he portrayed Rocky Dennis. Eric's performance is not only touching, but memorable, and makes you fall in love with this high school kid who dealt with many obstacles in his life, but makes it seem so effortless, because his mother in real life wanted Rocky to have a normal life.This film should be shown to those who have handicapped children or to classmates who have a classmate(s) with special needs, because it is important that we realize that they want to be treated like a normal person, and that people who have defects or handicaps are much more beautiful on the inside, this film did a wonderful job in showing us what this amazing boy was about.Mask can certainly leave you crying if you have never seen it, but it has points of humor mixed in with the serious topic and it's a very triumphant piece of work, and every actor and actress in the film, no matter how big or small the role was, was just as much of a champion for their contribution to the film.It's not exactly a family film, due to serious topics about drugs and alcohol, and the film uses harsh words at times, bit it's certainly one a parent should discuss with their child or children before watching it, I wouldn't suggest it to kids under 13, also this film teaches acceptance, which is something older kids 13 and up need to learn, and this film certainly would be a great teacher for that.Mask is a great piece of work, it will leave you wanting to see it again and again!",Mask

62,Space814,Recipe for waterfalls...,8,26 November 2005,"Ignore the fact that Cher is a leading character, because people either love or hate her as an actress - there's almost no gray area. She works in her role. Deal with it.No matter how much you might want to dislike the movie or thinks it's ridiculous, you can't. It hits right to the soul and tugs at every heart string and tear duct. I cannot listen to the last line of the movie without submitting to a fit of sobs. Never has a closing line captured the emotion of a completely movie as well as the last line of this movie:""Things I dig....the sun shining on my face....things that are a drag....the sun shining on my face.""Crap, I'm getting choked up again.",Mask
63,vincentripol,Continuously Inspirational,9,2 August 2014,"Although I'll probably consider ""The Last Picture Show"" as Peter Bogdanovich's greatest film, ""Mask"" is such a close runner-up, it's almost a tie - along with ""Paper Moon"". What's more surprising is the gap between those two early Bogdanovich classics and the mid-80's ""Mask"", making it a sort of comeback for the inconsistent director.It's a true story, and although it's been Hollywood-ized, it still rings true. The relationship between Cher and Eric Stoltz as mother and son is what anchors the film, and it's one of the most unconventional family dynamics ever portrayed, even in the era of the alternative single mother raising a unique child. Cher and Winona Ryder would come close to matching that chemistry in ""Mermaids"", but perhaps because ""Mask"" involves an only child, the bond is stronger and more focused than what Cher later achieved with Ryder and Christina Ricci.The supporting cast also is excellent, and includes ""Golden Girl"" Estelle Getty as Cher's mother, as well as Laura Dern as a blind teenager. Such great work all around helps the typical dramatic elements feel more natural, and highlights the real-life accomplishments of Rocky Dennis in an entertaining and inspiring manner, no matter how many times you see the film and know its outcome. Among many great scenes that were successfully incorporated for dramatic effect, the amusement park fun-house mirror is one of my favorites. I can't say enough positive things about this wonderful movie.",Mask

If you have children and want them to learn a valuable lesson about not not judging people by their appearance and treating others with kindness and heart then have them watch it. The acting down the line was fantastic and Cher was born to play this part. Eric Stoltz was masterful at conveying a young man dealing with the struggles and pain of a young man living with a life threatening disfigurement while keeping a great attitude. My only complain is that they never play this movie on tv.,Mask

It tell of the story of Rocky Dennis who suffered from a condition called that makes calcium build on his skull. At first I will admit, it was hard to look at Rocky but as you watch the movie, you see the real person. You see that he had a heart of gold. I also think this movie is one of Cher's best by far. I seen an interview she had done, where she said she went to visit the real Rusty Dennis. The director wanted to make Rusty ""family friendly"" but Cher said no. She wanted to portray her as close as possible to the real woman. The director was about to not give her the part because of it. I admire the fact that she wanted to portray someone as close as she possibly could. This movie also brings tears to my eyes, every time I watch it and I have seen it several times.",Mask

It has humour, action, sorrow, sarcasm, you name it it is in there. It just shows that sometimes the good guys don't always win, the ending is SO sad. The predudice is handled well and sadly we still have the same predudices present in our society today ( will we never learn?)

The role of Rusty is so powerful ,she makes you feel, think and live through her life. The way that she takes care of her son is so strong and brave, she doesn't stop with the fight for her son's life for a second. Once again I have to say how AMAZED I am with Cher, just look at the way she (Rusty) talks, walks, smokes... It's so clear that Cher got in to this role 100%. Also I have only good to say about Eric S. (Rocky) he handled this role so good! While I was watching the movie I could feel the love between Rusty and Rocky.

Mask teaches an important lesson about life: it doesn't matter what a person looks like, its what is inside that counts. i only wish that rocky could have lived longer, to achieve everything he wanted to. the fact that the story is actually true makes this film all the more poignant and profoundly moving. i would urge people who haven't seen it already: rent it out, or buy it. it will soften even the hardest of hearts.",Mask

She was a prostitute who, while Rocky and I we were in the hospital, was busted for turning tricks in Rocky's hospital bed, stealing drugs, needles, selling drugs, and stealing other patient's personal belongings. The hospital, being charitable, decided not to have her arrested; she was placed on a ""guarded list"" which meant that in order to see Rocky she had to be escorted by a guard who never let her out of his sight until she was escorted to the parking lot. The movie makes her out to be a concerned mother who was a saint. That is pure rubbish. She was such a ""good"" mother that the county considered putting Rocky in foster care. She would disappear for weeks at a time and Rocky would have to fend for himself living off the goodness of neighbours who fed him. He was a brilliant young man.

Anyway I love Mask!! No matter how many times I watch it, it always makes me cry. I know how it feels to be different & have everyone stare at you cause i was born with Spinal Bifida. I think The actors /actresses in Mask did an awesome job portraying the real life of Rocky Dennis. They couldn't have chosen a better woman to play his mom than Cher! She did great & really brought the emotional feelings to life in this movie!! Mask is my favorite movie & always will be!!!! God Bless Rocky L. Dennis!!!! I suggest that everyone should watch this movie at least once. Roy L. Dennis (Rocky) was a great kid & he was brave, strong, smart, independent & responsible. No matter what happened to him in life he never let it stop him from doing things. He was always there for his mother. He knew his life was going to be shortened, He always made new friends once they got to know him they loved him. Just goes to show you that you cant judge a book by it's cover. Rocky really was a wonderful guy & we should all be so lucky to meet others like himself with a great personality like his. We could all learn a thing or two from him & his story. So I recommend that everyone watch this movie even if u have to rent it. You can still rent this movie or specially order it through Borders Books Stores.",Mask
