0,SnoopyStyle,beautiful but lacking,5,24 January 2017,"Lonely Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) feels neglected by her often-absent doctor husband William Winthrop (Richard Coyle). Sotheby's is auctioning off the Windsor Estate including his abdication desk. She falls in love with their romance. She's desperate to have a baby and tries IVF. In flashbacks and in daydreams, King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and his love American divorcée Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) come to life.This Madonna project is beautifully costumed. She was probably meticulous with the designs and costumes. Her directing and writing prowess is another matter. The historical romance lacks a certain heat. It does have an upperclass comfortableness but it feels cold. With his abdication and their rumored Nazi connection, there should plenty of drama to work with. Madonna is stuck on their romance for a little too long and the drama is bled out of it. The performances of the royals are cold. The Nazi connections are papered over as Madonna is obviously making it a case of victim of falsehoods. It's fine to have a point of view but one has to pull it off. As for Abbie Cornish, her role has some big melodramatic moves. Overall, Madonna may have bit off more than she could chew.",W.E.
1,blanche-2,a directing/writing effort of Madonna,6,6 June 2017,"I suppose there is the germ of a good idea here, and 2011's ""W.E."" is not unsuccessful. As a directing effort by Madonna, it's okay. And you have to give her credit since she had to know everyone would be gunning for her.In 1998, the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor goes up for auction. One person particularly interested in it is Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), who is very taken with the love story between Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor, and particularly Wallis' life and other marriages. The film takes us through the courtship and marriage of the Duke and Duchess as well as Wally's disintegrating marriage to William, and then her relationship with the Soviet security guard she meets at the auction house.Personally I've never found anything romantic or sympathetic about Wallis and David. I think Wallis was a great excuse for David to duck responsibility and heap it onto his stammering brother. And neither he nor Wallis thought about what they were going to do once they were married. And what did they do? Roamed the world, showing up at a location when it was in season, and making friends who would write books about them after they died. By the time the couple realized what they had done, it was too late. No breaking up the great romance.Nevertheless, as many times as their story has been told, it's still fascinating, and much more interesting than the marriage of Wally Winthrop and her husband. Not to mention, there is a fantastic performance by Andrea Risborough as Wallis. As Edward, James D'Arcy is incredibly dashing and attractive. It's really the stronger story, and Madonna might have been better off just telling their tale, using a different point of view than others have in the past.The moral seems to be to take a risk and go for happiness. It's a fine moral; I'm just not sure I would use the Duke and Duchess of Windsor as inspiration. Was theirs a great love story? I'm sure it was, and no doubt the Duke's death hit the Duchess very hard. But they were human beings who undoubtedly fought, took one another for granted, and had some misgivings. And that's the big problem with idealizing any romance - in the end, the people we idealize are too much like us.",W.E.
2,ferguson-6,Let's do the Twist,4,25 February 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. The true story of Edward abdicating the crown for the love of his life transcends romance or history. It is even more interesting than the story of his brother's reign in his place ... as documented by Oscar winner The King's Speech. To think this man surrendered the power that comes with being King, lost his family, and was outcast from his beloved country, all because he chose this woman ... well that's what dreams are made of.This particular presentation is brought to us by director Madonna, who also co-wrote the script with Alex Keshishiam (the director of Madonna: Truth or Dare, 1991). An attempt is made to correlate a modern story featuring a Wallis and Edward obsessed Abbie Cornish, and a Russian security guard played by Oscar Isaac. This weak story line intertwines with the original story of Wallis Simpson and Edward. Guess which story is WAY more interesting than the other? Despite that, much screen time is wasted on Cornish and Isaac.Andrea Roseborough is outstanding as Wallis, the American twice-divorced spirited woman that Edward (James D'Arcy) falls so hard for. The only issue I had was that her speech pattern and tone reminded me of Rosalind Russell every time she spouted off another tart line of dialogue. Still, the sparks were evident between between these two despite the sometimes horrendous camera work. Which leads me to the biggest problem ... this is a poorly made film and it doesn't do justice to such an intriguing true life story.On the bright side, I found both the film score and the costumes to be spot on, and of the highest quality.",W.E.
3,phd_travel,Stylish and fascinating,9,28 July 2012,"Madonna did a good job - surprise, surprise! The directing is good. It is stylish and yet clear. There are romances in two eras, a modern ex- auction house employee played by Abbie Cornish who looks quite lovely here and the greatest love story of the 20th Century - Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. The blending of times as in Julie and Julia, is well done. It could have been confusing but it isn't.The modern story has a bit of a moral. The connection between the objects of the Duke and Duchess and their story is quite fascinating.Most of the main elements of the Duke and Duchess's romance and difficulties are portrayed quite thoroughly. For those who have seen the older miniseries with Edward Fox or the TV movie with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews, you will find most of the main things summarized here. Just the dialog is different and the story is more sympathetic to Wallis.The casting is mostly good. Andrea is very convincing Wallis and quite convincingly plays her. The casting of Edward wasn't as good. James D'Arcy isn't as regal as Fox or Andrews and he is a bit slimy looking. Afterall he is going to play Anthony Perkins in the new Hitchcock movie.Overall worth a watch for sure.",W.E.
4,gradyharp,"'Darling, they can't hurt you if you don't let them.'",7,8 May 2012,"The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera. That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well. In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorcée Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for 'the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer). The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again. The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.Everyone connected t the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done. Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love. In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director. Grady Harp",W.E.
5,malcolmgsw,Feeble Attempt To Rewrite History,4,21 January 2012,"I wont bother to comment much on the abysmal modern story since it has the effect of inducing sleep.a welcome state given the nausea inducing photography.Madonna has clearly decided that the much derided Duchess is really innocent of all charges leveled at her.So maybe she could have a go at the story of Diana Mitford and her love for the flamboyant Oswald Moseley,.Or she could plump for her sister Unity Mitford who tried to commit suicide on the outbreak of war over her unrequited love for Adolf.On the other hand Madonna could stick to warbling her melodies and not try to spread her talent,such as it is,rather too thinly. To you who think it is a masterpiece i would just ask why after one week on release in London has it virtually disappeared from cinemas?Clearly this should have gone straight to video.",W.E.
6,lasttimeisaw,"Madonna's vanity project? Yes, but it is exquisite.",6,7 April 2014,"Madonna's second film as a director, after the little seen FILTH AND WISDOM (2008). W.E. is her much more ambitious venture commingles Wally (Cornish), a modern woman's self-liberation from a dead water marriage and the scandalous love affair between American divorcée Wallis Simpson (Riseborough) and King Edward VIII (D'Arcy) which causes a constitutional crisis in the history. Shot with fluent confidence, this paralleled stories adeptly crisscross each other with two time-lines, with occasional but vital crossovers in the same frame as Wally's imagination goes wild. Voguish furnishings, exquisite reconstruction of the period flair with notable locales, it is glaringly Madonna's vanity project (who personally invested in most of its estimated $15,000,000 budget), even Evgeni (Isaac), an immigrant security guard of Sotheby's (he is the E in Wally's storybook), lives in a commodious penthouse and is also a dexterous piano player, that is to say, there is no grassroots trace in Madonna's notion of finding your Mr. Right. One can not deny the film has a certain cinematic register which is quite charming, primarily in Wallis and Edward's affair, probing from Wallis' viewpoint, the tenor is to see the sacrifice she has undergone for the romance although we may all assume it is contingent upon Edward's decision to favor this woman to his own kingdom. Andrea Riseborough is intrepidly intense to interpret a woman who merits such an accomplishment and what a heavy toll she takes for it, a career- defying role for her; and James D'Arcy, his royal temperament alone can be killingly fetching. As for Wally's narrative, it is a predictable damsel-in-distress situation, she is a trophy wife of an unfaithful husband (Coyle), who is a successful shrink, but not her prince-charming. Wally's insistence in IVF is met with harsh rebuttal and domestic violence ensues. Excessively loses herself in Walls & Edward's legend, and again predictably, his prince Evgeni is not what she expects. But the chemistry between Cornish and Isaac is comparatively tepid and more contrived, Abbie Cornish is habitually apathetic and Isaac seems to be too proud to patronizing his character and his love-interest. W.E. is a conventional fare to present Madonna's strongest suit in accentuating women's own volition in determining their fate, all the bells and whistles aside, it is an average output considering her submergence in the showbiz for all those years, an opportune deviation of her career-orbit is a smart maneuver. W.E. is slightly above my expectation, and adding more of her own pizazz, she could be on a par with her confidant Tom Ford (A SINGLE MAN 2009, 8/10), at the very least.",W.E.
7,secondtake,A fantasy with realistic (and historical) roots...well done!,7,29 October 2012,"W.E. (2011)Don't even think about who directed this. Think of it as a multi-layered, multi-era epic centering on the marriage of King Edward and his American love, Wallis Simpson. He's the English king who abdicated for love. But this is the story of the love, Wallis, the woman who gave up as much as the king did, or so the thrust of the movie suggests.It's rather good! It mixes a bit of fantasizing with a contemporary woman, Wally, finding her obsession with the Wallis of history (1930s) is more than coincidence. The narrative flips between several parts of the royal story before WWII and the contemporary version, which includes a budding relationship with a guard at an exhibition of Wallis Simpson memorabilia.Whether you find either story convincing doesn't matter. One of them is of course based on history, and is interesting if you don't already know the facts. The other is an echo of the same, with the woman having to become strong and independent just as her earlier namesake did. What is most interesting is the way the two stories are inter-spliced, including some scenes where the two times zones are mixed (apparently in Wally's head, but it's very real to the audience). We start to see how often and completely women are stuck in situations they would not choose if they knew ahead of time. It's about independence, yes, but also failure to be independent and the consequences. And maybe it's about learning a little from history.The director? Madonna. Yes, the singer from Michigan. The director of the terrible bomb ""Filth and Wisdom."" Here there is some real cinematic intelligence. It's a good movie. Flawed, a bit longer than it needs to be, a bit forced in the layering of stories, but well acted and conceived.",W.E.
8,l_rawjalaurence,Irritating Take on the Edward VIII/ Wallis Simpson Story,5,14 July 2013,"The romance of King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) has been retold many times before, most notably (for me at least) in the TV series EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON with Edward Fox in the title role. Madonna's version of the tale juxtaposes the story with a present-day tale involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), her violent husband William (Richard Voyle) and a Russian intellectual employed at Sotheby's in New York, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac). The parallels are obvious enough: Wally identifies with Mrs. Simpson and contrasts her own mundane existence with that of the royal lover. Eventually she comes to realize that she has the kind of life-choices denied to Mrs. Simpson. Shot in rock-video style, with fast cuts preventing any real identification with the characters, W.E. actually seems like an attempt by director Madonna to make sense of her own life as a singer/actress/celebrity. The settings are well drawn; the performances competent (even though D'Arcy looks nothing like the real Duke of Windsor). However the narrative tends to drag a little as it moves towards its predictable end. The film has certain incidental pleasures, notably the appearance of Turkish actor/star Haluk Bilginer as Mohammed Al Fayed.",W.E.
9,aharmas,Pretty Impressive,9,27 April 2012,"Someone did her homework! Going in a different direction than the vastly overrated ""King's Speech"", Madonnas has put together an interesting film that tries to explain the mystique and mystery of one of the greatest love affairs in modern history. As perceived by a modern character, we see the development of the intense relationship between the royal and the infamous Ms. Simpson, a woman who is still shown as a human being; yet she is portrayed as someone with a special spark, so we can see how the prince would even consider his drastic decision.Lavishly photographed and with excellent production values, we travel back to the crucial years of the romance, and with the leads' performances, we can see both the emotional core of the relationship, as it reaches its dramatic highs and lows. Whereas, the emphasis was on the clever use of words in the other British drama, this one concentrates on the humanity and flaws of the characters, exposing the raw nerves, without the theatrics.Whatever the public's impression might be, the film is never boring, and by showing the different time periods, we can capture the essence of the earlier ones. It's romantic, charming, and most of all, a lovely piece of cinema.",W.E.
10,dierregi,Wallis & Wally - better than expected,7,28 May 2012,"I watched this movie because I am fascinated by the period which nowadays is known as ""between wars"" but at the time was the roaring Twenties and Thirties.I was never a Madonna fan, and did not expect much from her as a director. Turns out, this movie was rather better than I expected. Two stories run parallel, with perhaps slightly too much time given to the less interesting story set in modern times. I watched Julie & Julia soon after W.E. and they both suffer from the same problem of original stories from the past interesting enough without real need to paste them into a modern environment.Told in non-linear fashion – which is quickly turning into the stalest device of cinematography - we follow the meeting and falling in love of Wallis Simpsons and future king Edward VIII. He seems a weak character who needed a strong woman to straighten him up from his debauchery. Unfortunately, Wallis was not quite the right person and she was also very much married when they met. The stress is made not only on the fact that Edward had to give up his empire for Wallis, but also on the fact that Wallis has something to lose from hooking up with the soon to be ex-king. Besides being despised by the whole Commonwealth, living up to the romance of the century must have been at times quite tiring.Modern days Wally is a less interesting person. She is a housewife trying to conceive (boring -all these reproductively-challenged women),only to discover that her husband is not so interested. Therefore, she has to resort to finding something else to fulfill her needs. The connection between the two stories is that modern days Wally and her family were obsessed with Simpson, named her after her and she used to work at Sotheby's before her marriage. The gallery is holding the auction of Simpson's stuff, so Wally keeps going there, perhaps also to have a chat with her ex-colleagues, as her husband is never around.The controversial scene of Simpson dancing at the sound of Pretty Vacant is for me a way to say that the life of Wallis and Edward was also pretty vacant. Once Edward (David, for family and lovers) gave up his title, he was officially unemployed for the rest of a life spent in golden leisure. Anyway, the scene fits very well with the atmosphere of the movie, which is of loss and uselessness more than romance and happiness.",W.E.
11,saadgkhan,bad direction and weak men of the movie makes it tedious,4,1 August 2012,"W.E. – TRASH IT (C+) W.E. tells the story of two fragile but determined women - Wally Winthrop and Wallis Simpson - separated by more than six decades. In 1998, lonely New Yorker Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) is obsessed with what she perceives as the ultimate love story: King Edward's VIII's abdication of the British throne for the woman he loved, American divorcée Wallis Simpson. But Wally's research, including several visits to the Sotheby's auction of the Windsor Estate, reveals that the couple's life together was not as perfect as she thought. Weaving back and forth in time, W.E. intertwines Wally's journey of discovery in New York with the story of Wallis (Andrea Riseborough) and Edward (James D'Arcy), from the glamorous early days of their romance to the slow unraveling of their lives in the decades that followed. Madonna's movie lacks a good direction and most importantly a good screenplay. Most of the times the movie becomes very tedious especially New York's scenes. Madonna was unable to find the balance between the both stories and in the end Abbie Cornish's story seems unsatisfied & unreal. Both the women Abbie Cornish and Andrea Riseborough are strong but the men of the movie are very week especially Oscar Isaac. He doesn't have romantic bone inside him and his expressions seem more aggressive than romantic. Abbie Cornish is a beautiful tall woman and he looks like a petite in front of her. Abbie Cornish's performance is great as well as Andrea Riseborough. Though personally I found Andrea Riseborough very pale and boring. I saw her for the first time in Resistance which is I think not a movie to judge an actor but still she looks the same even if she is playing the royal. She has this constant look of sympathy, she looks like a woman who is never happy and always lives in pain. James D'Archy is alright but I just couldn't found that love and chemistry between Andrea and him. Natalie Dormer plays a small role of Soon to be Queen Again I think it's in her destiny after The Tudors, W.E. and recently in Game of Thrones. W.E. has a good production value but bad direction and weak men of the movie makes it forgettable, even Abbie Cornish & Andrea Riseborough's performances cannot save this tedious venture.",W.E.
12,napierslogs,Dizzying efforts to unsatisfyingly relate a modern-era Wally to scandalized Wallis Simpson,5,7 April 2013,"""W./E."" opens with a depressed Manhattan house-wife in the 90s and Wallis Simpson marrying a husband in the 1920s. It's hard to say which era we were in since the film cut back in forth through time at a dizzying rate. The protagonist (if that's what she's supposed to be) is Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) named after the infamous Wally Simpson and living in a time she doesn't belong in.Her husband comes straight from the men's club-era husband of the 1950s where he makes the money and she just has to accept his beatings. She seems to also think that they're living in the 1950s and she unhappily resigns herself to living the role of his wife. As if women nowadays have no other options. It's a very backwards place to start a film from.The beginning is enough to make anybody sick with the rapid-fire cuts all over the place between the two eras, shaky camera work, and the modern-era Wally putting herself in ridiculously disastrous positions. The romanticists out there can probably get past that because the film will eventually get to the historic love affair between Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) and King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy). So well acted and reasonably accurate that their story is entertaining and informative.The film also eventually does a better job with splicing the two stories together. We actually spend full scenes in each era and then making some timely edits. The modern Wally is still a pretty insufferable protagonist but she may find love after all; however, the reveal of Wallis Simpson's life after marriage number 3 and British exile shows that the modern Wally picked a hero with very little to look up to.",W.E.
13,Quietb-1,Half bad is not good.,4,3 February 2012,"It's one on those two story stories. A classic love story about the king that gave up his thrown for the women he loved and a more modern story about a woman who channels her, while having a ""do we really care"" fling with a Russian security guard from the action house that is selling the original couples trinkets.The Wallis and Edward story is interesting as it takes the Simpson point of view about being the most despised women in the world. Who really gave up more, Edward the thrown of England or Wallis Simpson, who gave up her private life and became the most hated women in the world? It was fun to get another glimpse of brother Bertie who took the crown when his brother quit.Madonna has a written and directed by credit which explains why it's too long. The movie didn't know where to end. The old story was far more interesting and you wanted to stay in that period and sighed when it switched to the modern story.Good performances, clothes and music are a highlight but that isn't enough of a reason to see a movie. Skip it.",W.E.
14,TheSquiss,It's been directed by a biased fan with all the subtlety of a rampant sledgehammer.,2,16 June 2012,"It's very popular to bash Madonna. She did the unthinkable with American Pie, recorded what many regard the worst Bond theme ever (personally I'd give that status to Jack White and Alicia Keys) and starred in the barrel-scraping of Guy Ritchie's career, Swept Away. That's pretty damning evidence before we even begin to look at W.E.Conversely, she deservedly won a Golden Globe for Evita, remains one of the greatest, ever-evolving and most recognizable pop icons this planet has ever seen and has recorded some fantastic, of-the-moment albums that have maintained their brilliance years, and even decades, later and sold 300 million copies and counting.But, no, we can't escape the fact that she co-wrote and directed W.E.Purporting to tell the story of the romance of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII from the point of view the most hated woman in the world, W.E. dallies with her first marriage, ponders her second and deliberates over the third and final that brings about the abdication that rocked the Empire he ruled. It's a story that should be told. Focus is usually given to all that Edward renounced in order to marry the woman he loved and Madonna has decided to set the record straight. Unfortunately, her McGuffin is a latter day story about a Wallis aficionado, played by Abie Cornish and named after her heroine, who finds love with a security guard at Sotherby's while viewing the multitudinous lots in an auction of the couple's possessions. Yawn.It's not a dreadful film but it certainly isn't very good. It's been directed by a biased fan, rather than an impartial or enlightened expert, with all the subtlety of a rampant sledgehammer. Too much time has been spent on attempting to amaze with beautiful shots (a long sweep over the embracing couple that continues all the way up the never ending trunk of the tree they are leaning against) and clever juxtaposition that absolutely does not work (Wallis dancing to the Sex Pistols, anyone?).The music is overpowering and inconsiderate of the performances it drowns out in a Nicholas-Cage-in-pretty-much-everything kind of way. I'm sure that was a decision rather than an accident but it erodes any favour the film might otherwise gain from the deafened audience.At the heart of W.E. is a beautifully measured performance by Andrea Riseborough as the woman who would never be queen. Her presence is a resolute flower of quality in the midst of a period piece demolition site and her quality cannot be diminished by the inadequacy that surrounds her. It's good to see Richard Coyle back on the big screen in a role that will hopefully remind casting agents he exists but Lawrence Fox is a weak pastiche of the stuttering Bertie, particularly after the lauded portrayal by Colin Firth in The King's Speech.It's a mess. Other than Riseborough, the highpoint is, ironically, Madonna's song over the end credits but I'd give it a listen on YouTube rather than ploughing through W.E. to reach it.Another film review from The Squiss.

15,daniel-mannouch,Vacuous,2,21 April 2020,"Where to start with this one? I do not know what Madonna saw, or should i say did not see, in an aristocratic love affair between two fascist sympathisers, but here we are with W.E from 2011, one of the most insipid and surface level biopics i have ever seen. There is no real weight to any of this film's drama and nothing feels truly consequential or historic.On top of that, we have literally zero sympathetic or engaging characters. We have a selection of the absurdly rich, the obnoxiously entitled and domestic abusers, and Oscar Issac. And Oscar Issac alone was not enough to make this film tolerable.Whether it was sex pistols playing over decadent rich scum getting high or the Oliver Twist depictions of the working class, the screenplay reveals constantly how it has cherry picked from a complicated and somewhat scandalous period within British history in order to rework it, awkwardly, into a red lipstick feminist fable.Why out of all the other historical examples of empowered females that Madonna went with a high class socialite that contributed very little to the outside world is beyond me. But here we are and the film's message is nothing but feckless trashwater because of it.In conclusion, W.E is simply terrible. Apart from some good costume design, the film has aimless cinematography, mediocre acting and just, utter, trash framing for it's message of female independence that only serves to illustrate Madonna's own vapidness. If this film had not bombed incredibly at the box office, the damage it would have done to feminism would have been more than all the 4 chan users could ever hope to achieve in their wet loli dreams. Terrible movie. Just stay well clear.",W.E.
16,Chris_Pandolfi,The Year's Most Glamorous Melodrama,5,18 December 2011,"Madonna's ""W.E."" is one of the slickest-looking misfires of recent memory. As a contemporary melodrama – with high romance, deep tragedy, and a manipulative plot that completely bypasses the roadblocks of plausibility – it doesn't really deliver. As a showcase of costume design, makeup and hair, and art direction, it's a triumph. Every frame drips with sophistication and glamor, as if made to resemble a photo spread in an issue of ""Vogue."" Hagen Bogdanski's cinematography is beautifully theatrical, perhaps even dreamlike; he seems especially enamored with the snow white face of actress Andrea Riseborough, who, even through the fine mesh of a veil, looks as positively radiant as a Cover Girl model. I wouldn't be surprised if the film's striking visuals are noticed when award nominations are announced.""W.E."" could arguably be mentioned in the same sentence as Nora Ephron's ""Julie & Julia,"" as both are historically inclined and tell the story of women who share a connection despite being separated by era. This time around, the catalyst is Wallis Simpson, the American socialite whose third husband, England's King Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in 1936 to make their marriage possible. This was, in its time, quite scandalous, and to this day, Simpson remains a source of much speculation and controversy. One could also make a connection to last year's Oscar-winning ""The King's Speech""; it told the story of Edward's brother, Prince Albert, who was forced into becoming King George VI when Edward relinquished the crown. In no way should you think of ""W.E."" as a sequel, a continuation, an expansion, a branching off, or anything along those lines.Unlike ""Julie & Julia,"" one of the stories told in ""W.E."" is not based on a real person. In fact, were it not for the costumes and the modern era in which it takes place, it could have been transplanted straight from the pages of a dime store romance novel. The year is 1998. The place, New York City. Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) is the wife of a successful doctor named William (Richard Coyle). In public, he's a beloved figure of the community; we see him at a gala event being praised by his associates. In private, he's a distant, abusive alcoholic who regularly works late. Do I need to explain what that really means? He refuses to let her work, and he has complete control over their finances. In spite of his obvious lack of interest in his wife, Wally is eager get pregnant and repeatedly tries to make advances. When you're forcefully dragged out of the bathtub by your hair and thrown on the floor, perhaps it's time to consider an alternative method of conception.She obsesses over what she perceives to be the ultimately love story: That of Simpson and Edward. It just so happens that Sotheby's will soon be auctioning off several items of the Windsor Estate, and she grants herself several visits to do nothing but stare at the collection and tearfully daydream. We do know that she once worked at Sotheby's, although that doesn't explain the ease with which she gains access. Never mind. Keeping an eye on her is a Russian security guard named Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), who we eventually learn was an intellectual and is still one heck of a pianist. As the days pass, he bends more and more of Sotheby's house rules for Wally until such time when, yes, they fall in love. But then Wally flies to France and visits the estate of a man who has a collection of private letters written by Simpson. It seems her love life wasn't the fairy tale Wally made it out to be.The film frequently intercuts between 1998 and the early twentieth century, at which point we witness the various stages of the romance between Simpson (Riseborough) and Edward (James D'Arcy). When first introduced, she's forcefully removed from a bathtub by her abusive first husband and kicked in the stomach. She was, of course, pregnant, although the blood that spreads across the tiles tells us that a baby is not in the cards for her. We then see her during her second marriage to Ernest Aldrich Simpson (David Harbour), who seems remarkably calm and gentlemanlike when divorce becomes apparent. Indeed, she gets along splendidly with Edward. The two bounce witticisms and flirtatious comments off of each other like tennis balls.During these segments, Madonna revels in an atmosphere of pure high society, with lots of cocktail mixing, double cheek pecking, and gossipy chatter between young women in formal attire. And let's not forget the cigarette smoke. The curious thing is that most of the smoking is done by the men. In all their important scenes, Edward and Evgeni puff away like steam trains (we will eventually see Edward as an old man hooked up to an oxygen machine, which only goes to show). I don't think there's a name for it, but if you pay attention to the way they hold their cigarettes, you will have the uncanny feeling that you have reentered Hollywood's Golden Age, during which movie stars somehow made smoking seem elegant. I think I've just pinpointed the failure of ""W.E."": It's about an image when it should be about a story.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",W.E.
17,mrcibubur,A Well worked Movie to Tell the Alternative Love Story of WE,7,10 May 2012,"Just imagine if someone decided to tell the alternative love story of Charles and Diana or even Antony and Cleopatra, what would the public reaction be? i have a lot of respect for Madonna as a singer actress and director. i can see how much of a statement Madonna wanted to make with this movie, perhaps by casting herself indirectly as both Wallis Simpson and as this much criticized protagonist Wallis Wintrop.Madonna, as I recall, has a passionate life embracing of children and though she has children of her own, I think she adopts from overseas as well (Malawi if I am not wrong). My point is in in the desperation of the protagonist to show a woman who wanted to have children but was denied by her abusive partner. Pretty much the same one could say for Wallis Simpson in her relationships with two husbands and then with Edward Windsor.I disagree with some of the comments. The Script is perfect for the film and it is wonderfully directed by Madonna with great sensitivity and interpretation. there is nothing trashy about this movie. Compare to Angelina Jolie debut movie 'Milk and Honey"" and that is pure trash compared to this. Jolie could learn a lesson or two from Madonna.Yes the film is a short of spin off from Kings Speech but this is much more than a love story.There are indeed some careless errors in the final release which are absurd in truth but don't let these spoil your enjoyment of the movie as a whole",W.E.
18,grumpy-3,why and how can this get made,1,1 February 2012,"i only managed half of this very tedious film. where to start, a totally rubbish script, about two completely uninteresting women, who really have nothing about them. endless shots of crockery and tables and glasses and basically nothing. half an hour into this i felt as if the film had been going on for hours, so half way through i bailed. i feel angered that money and distribution can be gained for something this bad just because the perpetrator is Madonna. this would not have seen the light of day if written by an unknown or a jobbing writer. the 1998 story(if you can call it that) was so unbelievable and ridiculous, about a woman so utterly not connected to any form of reality, you begin to wonder wither Madonna has any grasp of the real world. i went into the film giving her the benefit of doubt, and thinking that the critics were unduly harsh because of who she is, but now i see it was even worse than the reviews made out.",W.E.
19,wruzek,Engaging but confusing,4,25 May 2021,"Both my wife and I were confused from the beginning as scenes alternated between the 1930s and current times so I think the distinction needed to be clearer. Other scenes regressing to the past were also confusing time wise. All this had a negative affect on the clarity of the stories which were intriguing. Last, I deduct for the single slur of the name of our Savior that Madonna and Hollywood find so necessary.",W.E.
20,DJRMewzique,Don't pass judgement on this one until you've seen it.,8,18 February 2012,"""W.E."" had one hell of an uphill battle. Not only is it a period piece, but the film is also written and directed by the one woman in the world that makes people pass judgement before even experiencing her work. That woman is Madonna.The film tells the tale of the infamously scandalous affair of King Edward VIII (aka David) and Wallis Simpson for whom, in the 1930s, he gave up everything for, even abdicating the throne of England. Being a twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson was a woman the monarchy would never accept, and because of that, David left everything behind for love. The film concurrently takes us back to 1998 and Wally Winsthrop, a woman who was named after Ms. Simpson by her Wallis-obsessed mother and who also finds herself in a marriage that is not living up to the magic she expected it to be, a fact which is brought more to life by the flirtations of a Russian security guard she encounters at an auction of the Windsor Estate at Sotheby's.I can honestly say that, despite being an enormous fan of most of Madonna's artistic endeavours, I was not sure how this film would play out. But you know what? It's a good film. First of all, it takes the perspective of Wallis Simpson in telling the first story, which goes against the norm. Secondly, the interweaving of the two completely different time periods is extremely well done, incredibly edited, and manages to keeps you invested in both stories equally. And most surprisingly, it was an entertaining history lesson: Not only do you learn of this hugely publicized affair but the film, in a way, is almost like a prequel to last year's powerhouse, ""The King's Speech,"" as that film focuses on Bertie, David's brother, who had to take over the throne once David renounced it.The film is not perfect, but as Madonna's second attempt at directing, you have to give her credit. Something many critics just refuse to do. No, the script is far from genius, but it's far from awful. The film is visually beautiful to watch and the integration of regular filming and documentary-style graininess makes for an interesting watch. Then there is the exquisite costumes for which this film is nominated for an Academy Award...and has a good chance at winning. And the performances, all of which are good. Andrea Risborough (""Made in Dagenham,"" ""Happy Go Lucky"") gives a strong turn, if not slightly off kilter at times, as Wallis Simpson. James D'Arcy is at times whimsical yet stoic as the terribly handsome King Edward. Abbie Cornish (""Limitless"") is close to heartbreaking as the suffering Wally Winthrop and Richard Coyle (""Prince of Persia"") gives a great performance as Wally's emotionally absent husband. And then there is Oscar Isaac, also in the Oscar-nominated ""Drive,"" as the incredibly handsome and sweet Russian who perks up each time Wally is around.No, ""W.E."" is not brilliant, but it's far better than you might expect, Madonna proving to be a far better director than anyone might give her credit for. And if you just love her for her music, the Golden-Globe winning ""Masterpiece"" plays along the closing credits. Although I have always preferred her musical endeavours over her cinematic attempts, this attempt is one she can definitely be proud of.",W.E.
21,DebraIonaVogel,Far better than you may think,7,29 December 2020,"It has its moments. A lot of them.This is a story about two women: Wallis Simpson and a contemporary women named for her by ""obsessed"" mother and grandmother.Their lives collide when Sotheby's holds an auction of the former King and Wallis's belongings and our protagonist visits obsessively.It's beautifully shot, lavishly even. The casting and costuming are superb. The scoring was simple, purposefully, and haunting.The story, from Wallis's perspective was interesting. Having just watched, ""The Crown"", I was familiar with the fall-out but not the falling in love. Fascinating.Our modern Wallie has a predictable and overdone story, no subtlety whatsoever. But, it ends well and who doesn't love a happy ending.This was a successful movie and it was only when the credits rolled thst I saw Madonna. I give her points for not casting herself as Wallis Simpson, I'm sure she was tempted.",W.E.
22,rodrigoalderete,Artistic sensibility or super ego reflection?,1,16 January 2015,"I have to describe this movie with 3 words.BORING.- This movie is all about the abdication of king Edward the 8th, (A Nazi follower perhaps?) to be with the love of his live Wally Simpson. The Spanish DVD title: ""The Romance of the century"" Please, give me a brake. PRETENTIOUS.- Is this the Madonna's artistic sensibility or her reflection of her super ego? This movie is a huge intoxicating display of glamor. So nauseous.PATHETHIC.- Madonna glamorizes a political crisis. At the end of the movie, when Prince Edward is old and dying, he asks to Wally: ""Dance for me"" and she dance the Chubby Checker's Let's Twist Again. I couldn't't stop laughing, is so pathetic. I don't want to watch this movie again.",W.E.
23,Koceny,Love story and drama,9,27 May 2021,"This movie is both classic and modern love story. It is a story about a young women Wally Winthrop from New York, living ""perfect"" life with her ""perfect"" doctor husband in a perfect upper town apartment. Underneath all this polished and perfect surface, she is unhappy and constantly daydreaming.What about? About one of the most famous love stories ever- between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII.Madonna draws the parallel between those two stories, constantly switching the story between past and present, between happiness and love on one side and unhappiness, disappointment and loneliness on the other. Story is unwrapping from there.Movie is easy to watch, and the characters go right under your skin from the start. It is very nicely directed, the cinematography is great. Casting is also very nicely done. Andrea Riseborough is very good choice for the role of Wallis Simpson, not to mention Abbie Cornish perfect for the role of young polished New Yorker.I would definitely recommend this move.",W.E.
24,castlekc4,Loved it,9,24 September 2020,"I had no idea this movie was tied to Madonna until I read the reviews . Well she did an amazing job..... this film was beautifully shot, the musical score was superb , and the story was heartbreaking. Bravo!",W.E.
25,socialmedia-437-956449,For dreamers and romantics,8,15 August 2012,"Madonna's second feature as director begins in 1998, where lonely Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed with the story of King Edward's VIII's abdication of the British throne for a woman he loved, the American divorcée Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). Wally's personal life is on the cusp of a dramatic change. On the surface, her marriage seems solid; her husband William is a successful therapist and the couple is envied by friends and relatives. But in reality, miscommunication takes the lead during our first encounter with the doctor at a dinner in his honor. Wally is not sitting beside him; and he either doesn't notice or acknowledge her presence. As she says, William is a smart manipulator, ""he can use my words against me"". He doesn't want her to work, but doesn't want children either. Wally tries to overcome her bitter reality by daydreaming about images from history.Wally ends up spending her long and lonely days at a Sotheby's auction house, looking at objects from the royal estate in Windsor and researching the doomed affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. The parallel lives meet through the imagination of Willis triggered by an object, a letter or a photo and sometimes an accessory she wears herself. On many occasions, she becomes one with her idol, getting inspired by her strength against all odds.The film cuts between Wally's self-discovery – which is noticed by a widowed Russian intellectual working as a security guard at the auction house – and the glamorous early days of King Edward and Wallis Simpson's relationship. The past and the present accentuate the similarities between the two women; one punished for being loved by a king, and the other punished by her insensitive husband.Last year's Oscar winner ""The King's Speech"" gave us a glimpse of the relationship between King Edward VIII and Simpson, casting Guy Pearce as the beleaguered king. ""W.E."" develops this section. This is by no means a historical film, it's like a poem narrated against background music. One notable feature of the film is the omnipresence of music, but it certainly isn't harmful.Andrea Riseborough's performance elevates her above the act of impersonation to reveal the character of a woman condemned by history. Her powerful acting is worth mentioning, making her one of the most promising rising actors in Britain today. Similarly, Madonna's directing shows a cinematic maturity previously unseen.If you're a dreamer who is questioning why a king would give up his throne for a woman, or if you just want to let go with a memorable love story, then this film is your answer.",W.E.

In parallel, a modern-day Wally is trying to reconcile her own ""perfect"" romance.Modern-day Wally admires the Wallis Simpson collection up for auction at Sotheby's and each piece returns us to the past to see the item in use. The clothing and set design and production are amazingly gorgeous.This film was photographed BEAUTIFULLY, wonderfully scripted and the cast provided award-nomination-worthy performances.

27,mad_mandonna,"Almost, yet not quite.",6,28 January 2012,"W.E. is one of three biopics I have seen this year, after The Iron Lady and J Edgar. Of the three I think W.E. is probably the best, but all three tread the path of the mediocre. What W.E. gets right is Wallis Simpson, Riseborough is fantastic in the lead role and has great chemistry with James D'Arcy. The biggest problem with the film is the the second tier of the romance with Abbie Cornish's Wally Winthrop, though the romance picks up momentum around the one hour mark, it slows down the pace of the Wallis Simpson segments.The script has high and low notes, the romance at times is reduced sappiness, but these are forgivable even when they are at there worst. What is probably the biggest weakness in W.E. is the often used close up hand held camera shots. The occasional one works nicely, but these shots are put in far too often and take you out of the story. In most cases the camera work could have been more simplistic, it too often feels erratic which isn't good in the more tender moments of the film.The music in W.E. is beautiful and the addition of ""Masterpiece"" in the credits is a lovely song to go side by side with the film. However sometimes the music is a little over powering, once again just a case of less is more. The much discussed and derided scene with Wallis dancing the Charleston with a tribesman to The Sex Pistols ""pretty Vacant"", I really liked. I felt the scene was a fun and good way to show how frivolous the character could be, using the modern day Wally's imagination to keep the scene from feeling alien.Undoubtedly the best part of W.E. is the costume and lighting. The attention to detail in this department is incredible. Every costume looks stunning and is meticulously put together down to the nearest diamond, and the lighting makes the landscapes almost feel like paintings it really is stunning.All in all W.E. is a great attempt from Madonna to craft a stunning looking film, though the storytelling can be muddled and the film takes around 40 minutes to really get going, its once again forgivable. Historical inaccuracies put aside would have made this film a 7, but not exploring the Nazi element could have made this so much more interesting. The negative reviews of this film aren't looking at it from fair perspective and anyone with half a brain can see though not amazing, W.E. is at least half decent and for a directors second film pretty damn good.",W.E.
28,italo505,Who's story is it anyways?,7,10 April 2012,"Wally's story goes like this: set in 1998 NYC, a woman recently married finds herself pretty much alone in her nice condo while her husband goes to work and hardly ever comes home to bed. The newlyweds don't have much in common to begin with, she apparently marries him for convenience (perhaps?) and he obviously owns her as a trophy wife and soon he begins an affair behind her back. It seems that her only escape from her reality is to visit a museum where Wallis and Ernest's (or W.E., for short) items were to be auctioned. She feels a connection to Wallis Simpson in particular and begins to wonder how much did she also have to give up to be together with her love, the King of England. During her frequent visits to the museum she meets this handsome security guard (Oscar Isaac) and they begin a friendship that leads to something more... That's the only problem I have with this film, as in 2009's Julie & Julia: why do the secondary characters take over the story? You wanna know the life of a woman who revolutionize French cuisine for all Americans and the world (Julia Child) or the woman whose blog becomes popular because of Julia Child, the blogger Julie Powell? Same thing happens in W.E where we begin to see Wally's screen time increase as the movie goes along while Wallis's tragic story of love and sacrifice diminishes towards the end of the film.﻿Who's story did Madonna want to tell? Are we supposed to follow both women equally in their journeys? Why not spend more screen time with Wallis Simpson and the exiled King Edward VIII who had to give up his role as King in order to be with the woman he loved, later to be forced to live in south of France, away from the Royal Family and his homeland to avoid the scandal and criticism from marrying a divorcée? Or would you rather see an unhappily married woman search for herself in the artifacts of Wallis and Edward? At one point you're not sure where to invest your whole attention to and the movie loses precious momentum that could have be spent developing King Edward and Wallis Simpson' story a bit deeper than what meets the eye.Don't get me wrong: W.E. is still visually breathtaking and one thing I must say about Madonna is that she's an expert in the details, from the wardrobe to the make up to the hair style, and Andrea Riseborough as Wallis Simpson really shines through. Every time I saw Wallis on the screen I was captivated by her confident inner beauty, she was obviously the purpose I came to see the movie and it made me think of Madonna's Evita Perón. Madonna's muse fleshed out a beautiful performance that will be hard to forget. Andrea Riseborough is W.E.'s real star power and deserves her first Oscar nomination for Supporting Actress (or is it Best Actress, I'm confused here) and her performance is certainly worth your hard earned dollars.

30,Braindead09,Its too easy to dismiss this one has a Madonna vanity product,7,21 January 2012,"Interesting feature film directorial debut from Madonna who shares script writing duties with Alek Keshishian.The film refreshingly tries to tell the story of Wallis Simpson from her side concerning the lead up to and the aftermath of her romance with the Prince Of Wales. The selected highlights meshes into 1998 and parallels the failing marriage of a young New York woman who conjures up Wallis in her mind as she spends days visiting Sotherbys where artefact's related to the late Simpson were on display.The film goes straight for the belly and does not sway from marital abuse that both woman will have to endure and immediately made me remember all the newspaper headlines associated with Madonna during her marriage to Sean Penn. I don't know if this aspect of the film was intentional.The production values are very good and Madonna uses an interesting device early on showing archive footage of the main characters and then cuts to the actors. It helps the viewer jump the common cliché that X don't look like Y. The let down is the use of the 'Pretty Vacant' during an embarrassing pill popping session, one can imagine Madonna had a field day choreographing that dance session especially the black extra who looked more like an extra from Superfly than a member of the ruling class elite.The modern sequences shows a lonely woman and lonely man in a chalk 'n' cheese coupling convincingly falling for each other and Madonna tracks how that relationship develops and with one character how the marriage dissolves. Again this viewer began to look too deep and wonder how much of this stuff is autobiographical.Its too easy to dismiss this one has a Madonna vanity product, she obviously has a future ahead of her as a filmmaker. Shame it took her 50 years to reveal this talent.",W.E.
31,TinyDanseur27,Visually rich and very moving: a new perspective on Wallis Simpson,8,25 June 2013,"I love period films, especially British period films, so I knew I must see W.E. I think that there's always been some mystery surrounding Wallis Simpson. What kind of woman was she that could make a man renounce his throne? I think history paints her in a very bad light. She was a ""Nazi sympathizer"" or a ""manipulator"". Madonna aimed to tell her side of the story with this movie. I can't help but wonder how true it is, but regardless, I really enjoyed it.An interesting aspect of this movie is that it not only tells the story of Wallis and Edward, but it also tells the story of a woman named Wally Winthrop. She's a woman in the 1990s, trapped in a failing marriage, who lives vicariously through the story of Wallis and Edward because she believes that theirs was the great romance of the century. Her story is interesting, not only because Abbie Cornish's acting is heart- wrenchingly moving, but also because she represents a modern-day woman's struggle with the same issues that Wallis herself may have experienced. There were many parallels between the two plots. I think that having the two stories made what could have been a typical bio-flick into something much more interesting.I must mention the actors who played Wallis and Edward, Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy. Their portrayals of the characters were so multidimensional. I kept changing my mind about how I felt about them. They were also just so committed to the roles. I watched the special features after the film. The actors talked about all the time they spent training with voice coaches, dance instructors, riding instructors, etiquette coaches, and even a bagpipe instructor. They really immersed themselves into these two people. I really love that about bio-flicks. The level of commitment it takes to become another person is extraordinary. When actors take the time to do so, the result is magical, hence why I love Daniel Day Lewis so much.Anyway, I wanted to write about this movie because it really moved me. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it was the woman's perspective, maybe it was the visual richness created by the costumes, sets and makeup, or maybe it was the fabulous acting. Who knows... I loved it. I recommend it to anyone.",W.E.
32,mrocco-1,"Worth watching, esp in 2020",8,21 September 2020,"I always read the reviews before watching, usually the more negative ones to get a clue if I don't want to bother. I almost never don't finish a movie (or book) no matter how bad, so want to avoid that torture if I can. I just want a good story with no cliffhanger endings, doesn't have to be sophisticated or mind blowing lol. One of the negative reviews said something about no resolution so I went in with trepidation. I'm so glad I watched it, completely entertained. The story of two women from different times who share a first name and some similarities in their lives (something like Julie & Julia). Everything felt 'resolved' so to speak. I would say it's a romance of sorts, with the idea that there is no such thing as pure fairy tale endings. Maybe the moral being one's ability to make changes to alter your destiny, with lots of undertones on what fame and celebrity can do.If you're looking for some entertainment that isn't about any of the social issues going on in 2020 AND no commercial breaks, add it to your netflix list :)",W.E.

I am NO fan of Madonna and frankly I am shocked she had this movie in her. It is complex, beautiful and an experience not to be missed. I only watched it because the music is my favorite composer but based on the reviews I didnt expect much. The costumes were outstanding as was the set design.

34,soph_ia,Go away Wally,6,26 February 2016,"If I were to review this movie aesthetically it would be an 11/10. It is a nice movie to look at. The Edward/Wallis scenes in particular were pure eye-candy, especially for a period drama lover like me. The score of the movie was also great. It was actually one of the movie's tracks (""Dance For Me Wallis"") that introduced me to this movie and made me want to watch it.Sadly, as beautiful as this movie is, it falls rather flat where its story is concerned. The entire Wally storyline should have been omitted altogether. The only good thing about it is that it has Oscar Isaac. This movie would have been great of it was just about Edward and Wallis. I actually thought that was the case and that Abbie Cornish and Oscar Isaac's characters were museum/auction people of sorts and that Edward and Wallis' story would be narrated through them.To start with, Wally is a boring character. She does not deserve to be the protagonist of this movie and we as an audience do not deserve to have to go through her boring life when we could be watching a much more interesting story; Edward and Wallis'.Wally and Evgeny were supposed to mirror Wallis and Edward which I frankly found stupid because they really didn't have that much in common? You are hardly creating a parallel just because the characters' names start with the same letter. I also found Wally's name cheesy, much like the explanation behind why she's called that. I get that it was a big part of the film that she's obsessed with Wallis but I think they could have easily made that point even if her name was Jessica or Sarah. Her being called Wally was something you'd expect from a story written by a twelve-year-old, not professionals.Another problem with this movie is that although it is a romance the actors don't really have that much chemistry with each other. Oscar Isaac is an actor who I think can be charismatic even next to a cactus but I still did not find Evgeny and Wally's love story particularly engaging. James D'Arcy and Andrea Risenborough are somewhat better together but I still didn't feel like Edward and Wallis' love was so grand and strong as the movie wanted us to think. I actually find that they have more chemistry in pictures (like that promotional picture of them on the beach) than they did in action.All in all I think that if they omitted the Wally storyline altogether and kept it about Edward and Wallis only (but still found a place for Oscar Isaac in that storyline because he is frankly too awesome) this movie would have been a lot better.",W.E.
35,shoshanim,Worth your while,8,18 October 2021,"This glimpse into the affair between Wallis Simpson And Edward is an interesting take from a questionable aspect. But I think the whole movie would have been even better without the contemporary woman's part.A young woman named after Wallis, (as her mother and grandmother were somewhat obsessed with Mrs. Simpson), is going through a painful life transition, and begins to fixate on the experiences of her namesake. To my mind, the two women don't seem to have much at all in common, and I feel it is distracting from the better story in the film: the actual tragedy laying beneath the King's and Mrs. Simpsons love affair.The film is exquisitely shot, and utterly beautiful throughout. The writing and characters kept you engrossed. I say, well done, Madonna!",W.E.

Still there are absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever. The movie totally misses it's mark. No passion, no sex, no feelings - nothing. You missed out on this one Madonna. I a movie are to show us how true passion is bigger than everything - yes, there has to be passion involved. And another thing - spoiler coming - in the contemporary story a woman are married to a cheating husband, who also abuses her - still SHE ask HIM: ""Why won't you have sex with me"". Come on... please! Why would she be stupid enough to want to have sex with a cheating and abusing husband? This movie really sucks and i would not recommend it to anybody.",W.E.
37,davebest2001,Confused and cack-handed,3,23 January 2012,"Stories about royal scandal are usually surefire hits. The stories are there to be told. With a decent screenplay, nice costumes and some good actors, you should be able to create a decent film...unless the direction and concept is as cack-handed as this. I am often annoyed by films that move forward and back in time without chronologically telling the story. It's often a cover for poor editing. This is very much the case with this film. My head was spinning from all of the location and date changes. Another problem I had with this film were the supposed parallels between the modern day Wallis and Wallis Simpson. The links were very weak indeed. I was waiting for the scene that tied up both women's stories and it never came along. James D'arcy was a ridiculous choice for the part of Prince Edward. He is about 6' 3"". The real Edward was around 5' 8"". They looked nothing alike. Archive footage of the real Edward VIII intercut with the actor made the whole film look ridiculous. It was like a spoof scene were the stuntman looks nothing like the actor being punched. Overall this film was only watchable really for the acting of Andrea Riseborough, who looked very like Wallis Simpson and was believable as well. Not a film for repeat viewing. Overlong, boring and nonsensical",W.E.
38,SusanShop,Lovely job by Madonna,8,26 February 2012,"This film interested me because it, in part, tells the story of Wallis Simpson and Edward, Prince of Wales who gave up his place as King of England to be with the woman he loved. It is one of those modern day fairy tales, we love...there are so few !! The juxtaposition of a parallel love story adds a new element to the Wallis/Edward story. I wouldn't call it a chick flick, but definitely a date movie. Wallis, our heroine, named after Wallis Simpson uses that connection to help her explore the Wallis/Edward story and answer questions she has about her own life and marriage. I think Madonna has done a credible job writing this film. I recommend you see this film, and enjoy the fairy tale.",W.E.
39,sissyneck23,I've seen worse,6,22 February 2020,"Not half as bad as everyone is saying.

40,zoerobe,Better than I expected,7,15 July 2012,"Madonna's ""W.E."" is the perfect movie for people who watched ""The King's Speech,"" and liked it, but thought it could totally be improved by adding a little rock-and-roll to the montages, rather than stuffy old Beethoven. If you thought ""TKS"" took a rather harsh view of the Romance of the Century by focusing on the less glamorous characters of King George VI and his family, while portraying the Duke and Duchess of Windsor as irresponsible, party-hardy, Nazi-sympathizers, than you'll appreciate a more soft-focus version of their relationship. Never fear, it's all here.The film moves back and forth between the present day in which Abbie Cornish plays a depressed woman whose marriage is crumbling and who spends her time visiting Sotheby's, where an upcoming auction of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's property is about to commence, and the past which traces the Duchess's (Andrea Riseborough) life from her marriage to the abusive Win Spencer through the abdication crisis with the Duke (James D'Arcy). Cornish's character, also named Wally, is fascinated by the woman whose story of sacrifice in marrying the Duke is much less known than vice versa. As the present-day Wally comes to face the truth about her marriage, she finds solace in a Russian security guard at Sotheby's and gains the courage to move forward with her life.It's probably a cheap pop-psychology analysis to guess that Madonna may identify with a celebrity who was widely reviled in her time, although possessing a great deal of style and panache. ""W.E."" is not Oscar-bait, except perhaps costume-wise, but it's surprisingly enjoyable, as long as you take it for what it is: entertainment, not a profound meditation on Serious Issues.",W.E.

42,peter-1850,Ghastly piece of rubbish,1,5 November 2012,"Slow and pointless. Strangely it manages to be confusing too, jumping between various yanks, all notable for being loud and unpleasant.I hadn't realised that Madonna was involved with this project. It makes sense, though. It's loud, brash and empty.I thought that I was doing a favour to my wife by getting what looked like an entirely girlie film - awash with anti-male prejudice. Sadly she didn't like it either.What a waste.I can't imagine who would want to watch this sort of rubbish. It must appeal to somebody or, presumably, the time and money wouldn't have been wasted on it.",W.E.
43,Greigx3,"pretty, awful.",1,25 January 2012,"There have been a lot of mixed reactions to this film. There's a reason  for that: it's both good and bad. I didn't enjoy it but  staying away  from the obvious tendency to judge this film based solely on the fact  it's Madonna who's directed/co-wrote it  there are some diamonds in  the (very) rough.  The film tries to take two story lines which are set in completely  different times and places, and merge them into one film. One of these  plots are really good, the other really bad. The good one is the story  of Edward VIII who abdicated from his place on the throne in order to  marry a commoner, Wallis Simpson. The bad one is the story of an  ordinary New York woman who's in the process of leaving an abusive  relationship. The second story is trashy, melodramatic pulp. Any  relation between these two story lines is contrived and every time it  cuts between the two, it feels very awkward, forced, meaningless and  confusing.  It's a real shame, because the story of the Edward VIII is an extremely  interesting one. There's so much there to write about: his  controversial lifestyle, marriage to Wallis Simpson, abdication,  relationship with George VI and the rest of the royal family  not to  mention his alleged Nazi sympathies and friendship with Adolf Hitler!  As a straight historical drama, this story would be truly riveting and  I personally think it deserves a big budget treatment. It could even do  well as a glossy romantic drama or a gritty political drama  or a  mixture of both.  I do appreciate that Madge has tried to tell this story (which has been  done in film and TV before) from an alternative perspective: through  the eyes of Wallis Simpson. This is a credible idea but the film  doesn't focus enough on it. Instead, it's needlessly confused by a  boring, ambiguous plot featuring a deluded and emotionally erratic  protagonist nobody can relate to.  The film is occasionally historically inaccurate and utterly bizarre in  places. There is a point where a news reporter states that Edward is  succeeding King George III, when it is in fact King George V (the  former died more than a century before). There are also several  absurdities and moments of sheer bad taste, most notably a scene where  Edward and Wallis are popping pills at a party as they dance to the Sex  Pistols in the 1930s! The fact Madonna chose the song 'Pretty Vacant'  is probably more fitting than she'll realise. There is a consistent  stream of these absurdities which cause serious detriment to the film's  tone and coherency  as if it wasn't already hard enough to understand.  There is no conclusion to this film either. By the end nothing is  resolved, everything becomes wholly ambiguous and no explanation is  given as to the meaning or core purpose of the film. Just before the  credits role, as the camera pans up from nothingness to yet more  nothingness, you're left thinking ""what was the point in all of that?""  Credit where credit's due though: the film has some nice  cinematography. The fashion and costume design is great too. It's  visually very good and you can tell there are some people working on  this film who know what they're doing, but it's all wasted on a rotten  script. The film seems to concentrate on fashion, materialism,  aesthetics and stylistic elements more than telling a compelling story.  It's just superficial.  For me, the bad outweighs the good, and W.E. appears as nothing more  than an opportunistic derivative of a sub-plot from the King's Speech,  with potential that would never be realised here. Madonna's film is  brash and contrived at best, random and pointless at worst.",W.E.
44,BrendanBakos-1,W.E (2011 ) Hmmmmm,5,4 January 2020,"Okay this film is Madonna's second film she has directed , released in 2011 . But made a year later l have to agree with another user review here ! This film is sort of hit & miss ! There's one scene with the lead characters were is moving around & around & around not effective in my opinion . It's a love story yes & showing us that love is important to some than power money or leadership when you really love someone you will sacifives all most anything ! Madonna's daughter Lola did have a small part that Madonna deleted out of the film before it was released in 2011",W.E.
45,josemedeirosforsenate13,One of Madonna's best films so far!,10,29 February 2012,"I finally got to Watch W.E this week and really enjoyed watching the movie. I myself never knew that King Edward VIII abdicated the throne of England for the love of a woman prior to watching this film, and this movie did a great job explaining just how much King Edward VIII must have loved Wallis Warfield Simpson to give up such a position that he was destined for. Little did I know that his brother was King George VI, who Colin Firth portrayed in ""The King's Speech"", also a very good movie about a king who stutters, and has to over come his speech impairment during the bombings of World War II, to inspire and give his people hope, in one of the most difficult times in England's history! Although I very much enjoyed the movie, I hope that Madonna makes a few changes in the DVD when it's released, such as adding the year at the start of the film, and the year during the transition from past to present when we first see Wally Winthrop played by the very beautiful Abbie Cornish. I also noticed that some of the transitions were cut to short, and may have been deleted to keep down the film length for the theater or the film was damaged and repaired for the Projector at the theater I watched it at, (I couldn't tell which ), but I would like to see the additional footage in the DVD release. I also really enjoyed watching the making of the movie on You Tube, and since the theater that I watched the movie in lacked a DLP projector, The vividness of the landscape and characters filmed in HD, just did not do this film justice watching on an old theater projector.",W.E.
46,markgunston-197-661169,Style without substance,3,9 June 2012,"This was a frustrating film to watch for me as I felt that the modern sub plot running alongside the historical one did not seem necessary and padded out a very thin story. Very little actually happens during the film. The sub plot seems contrived and the main drama is a series of parties and the odd radio announcement or newsreel to provide exposition.Though the 2 leads are well cast as Wallis and Edward we feel at a distance from them and never really get to know what drives them. Abdrea Riseborough as Wallis comes across as quite an unsympathetic character and I do not think that was the intention of the director. We never really get to know why she was so attracted to Edward and the movie feels like a collection of functions and events without getting into the soul of the characters. Abbie Cornish as Wally Winthrop in the modern sub plot comes off as a far more endearing character playing someone who could be viewed as slightly barmy and obsessive. She has a very appealing screen presence and I would tip her for major stardom in the future. She oozes femininity and has great poise. Madonna keeps inserting shots of her walking slowly and seductively away from camera which do not seem to serve the story but are there because they look good. I felt that Oscar Isaac as the Russian security guard was a serious piece of mis-casting. I am sure his character was intended to be an intellectual man with great humanity but he looks more like a gangster.The film has great costumes and art direction as expected. What makes this very slow moving film quite watchable at times is the score by Abel Korzeniowski which envelopes and drives the action, in fact papering over the cracks. A rather sterile movie going experience.",W.E.
47,sahlawi,"good job, story is informative, but poor ending",6,10 February 2012,"Well, here is the thing, as the first Madonna movie, its a good movie, the score in the movie is nice, costumes from that era are well presented, and the overall acting is not bad. This is the first time that I watch anything about Wallace Simpson, and I almost watched everything on the British history and British royal family, so in that regards the movie is well informative about her and the story from her side. Its not all glamorous and fun times to party with a king/prince. The movie showed the struggles that Wally faced in her relationship with King Edward the eighth. What I didn't like, and that I will have to blame it on the director, is the way the climax and the ending. The movie had a number of climaxes, they were all important but they came in at different times as oppose to have them all come at once, which would have been more thrilling for the audience. The movie also seemed to have numerous endings and they kept prolonging it although it was given and obvious what will happen at the end. Every time a scene ends towards the end of the movie I was getting ready to exit the theater, and then get surprised with another scene, I at least did that 3 times. I gave the movie a 7 because it was not well presented, the overall experience was nice and very informative in my point of view. You will definitely learn something new about King Edward and the British royal family, and you will defiantly learn much more about the women involved in the lives of powerful men (will that be a king, a doctor, or a military officer). I would say go watch it.",W.E.

49,cgc668,Beautifully crafted - much depth,8,5 May 2012,"I thought the film was brilliant. Certainly, there were a few historical inconsistencies but, if you watch the movie simply for what it is - an intriguing love story, and the woman obsessed with it - you can clearly see the beauty of it. *There might be a very slight spoiler below*. Visually, I thought it was greatly stimulating - and the music was very moving. I loved the way the film intertwines the two women - Wallis Simpson (the Duchess) and another woman (Wally) in 1998, who, also, seems to be living the perfect life to the outside world, but is not. Wally is in an emotionally neglectful, abusive relationship with a man who provides everything for her (materialistically), but is never home. She becomes obsessed with the story of the Duke and the Duchess - and the fact that the Duke abdicated his throne for the woman he loved. She longs to understand that kind of love - and delves into their story (all the while, developing her own story). Throughout the movie, we are taken back and forth from the story of Wallis and Edward to 1998, Wally. During many moments of the movie, the two women interact(metaphorically). At one point, Wallis Simpson is walking through the streets in a seemingly happy mood, when she notices her affair with Edward being negatively cast on the front pages of newspapers. She rushes into a nearby building, upset - when she sees 'present-time' Wally, watching her. She stops for a moment and looks at her. Then she says, ""Get a life."" In another scene, Wallis is crying in bed over the fact that she and the Duke have basically been exiled - and the 'present-day' Wally, sits beside her and tries to comfort her, stating, ""At least you have each other."" Wallis, then, sits up and slaps Wally, saying, ""Wake up!"" In which, Wally is immediately woken from a dream.The movie certainly had depth - and there is much in what is not said (facial expressions, simple words - actions, music). One of my favorite movies is 'The Hours' - and I would say, in regards to tone and depth - this movie is similar. I loved it.",W.E.
50,kathyshalleck,Amazing,9,22 May 2012,"I thought it would be crap (re: what the reviews I read had indicated), but I loved it. The actors are so pitch perfect for their parts - especially Wally and Wallis. An interesting take to see what Wallis gave up as versus what King Edward did(and the trap she ensnared herself in). The costume design - the clothes alone were worth seeing this film. Sometimes the going back and forth between different time periods can be disconcerting - but it worked in this movie. And I really loved the scene on the park bench where Wally hands Wallis the gloves she bought at the auction at Sotheby's. ""M"" (as all the actors address her in the behind-the-scenes) is a better director than she ever has ever been an actress (well, let's say ""thus far"" - as she is always reinventing herself). I think I have to own this film.",W.E.
51,misterjiggy,Aesthetically beautiful but just a bit predictable in Direction,6,10 August 2013,"This movie obviously had a tremendous budget and no expense was spared in their sets and quality of costumes and locations which are superb and the real 'star' of this movie. It appears that the director really took great pains to ensure authenticity with regard to Wallis Simpson's wardrobe as well as the Royal's wardrobe and their lifestyle. I was quite mesmerized with the laissez faire life that Wallis and what was to be the future King had created and this movie if to be believed portrays it very well. The parallel story in this movie whilst interesting really does not add anything to the already complex and intriguing life of Wallis and Edward; therefore, had the director focused more on W.E., this movie may have been more successful.You can sort of discern in this movie that the Director is 'thinking' out loud to themselves in the way some of the scenes are shot. The director has her actors over emphasize actions in order to convey an emotion that the director thinks is subliminal to the audience when in fact it is just too obvious that the director is a bit immature in their direction. Had this director allowed emotions to develop sincerely without the obvious conjecture of 'set-ups', then again this movie would have been dually successful.",W.E.
52,almax-28716,Almost awful,2,7 August 2020,I wish they just told the story of Willis Simpson and Edward. Andrea Riseborough is absolutely brilliant and really shines. The modern part of the movie needs to be flushed in a toilet - so pathetic and awful!,W.E.
53,EvelinaDim,Powerful and feminine...,7,26 January 2014,"On a winter Saturday evening with tea in hand one wants to watch a nice story, a romance perhaps. Browsing through the film options on that genre W.E would perhaps feature under the apprehension, guilty pleasures not high expectations category and with Madonna under the directorship comes with a condescending feeling of poor cine plot quality and a mainstream story line. Curiosity, a good cast and movie was rented...Two hours later the deceiving nature or preconceptions was confirmed...The storyline based on Wallis Simpson and King Edward's relationship, excluding the public and royal element, is another one of an affair, however of a great romance and the uncompromising need of a man and a woman to share their lives. Hardly and innovation. However, the palindromic movement between past and present and the similarities in the female nature for mending, preserving, enduring well acted by Abbie Cornish as Wally, a contemporary woman trapped in a dysfunctional relationship and Andrea Riseborough (Wallis) a historic figure but mostly a woman in '30s being bigger than the mediocrity of her marriage. Madonna, delivered a fairly satisfactory result following the historical facts of the relationship, however the angle of which the relationship was viewed from is more important than the historical accuracy.The film explores the different ways the two women deal with their quest for true love, and the power in trusting their instincts. Wally's need for escapism, identity and a point of reference to relate to, lead to an infatuation with the tales of Wallis Simpsom. Abbie Cornish gives a good performance portraying the journey from sadness, insecurity and self depreciation through the train of hope to a place of contentment and that collarbone of most movies of such genre that always something happens that enlightens you and you know what the right thing to do is. She is transformed from the wife hidden behind plain dark outfits to a confident woman in tailored Diors.The photography is very eye pleasing and smooth; combined with the sharp and couture costume designs appropriate to the strength of the characters of the leading figures, make a strong screen visual outcome.Maddona delivered a good movie, one for many women to see themselves in, to relate to and be inspired, to trust their wants, and persevere for what they believe is right which may not be in agreement with the society's consensus. Overall, a very promising directorial debut and one to watch.",W.E.
54,Imclueless1,Mixed emotions on this one may contain spoilers,5,23 June 2012,I really enjoyed the part of the movie from the past but dreaded when it went back to the present. The wonderful love between Wallace and David was so intriguing and the contrast brought on by the present Wally and her dreadful husband was disheartening. It was pleasant and unpleasant.I also felt it dragged and I welcomed the end. I guess I expected more from the creative mind of Madonna. I would probably enjoy a version of this where the present parts were eliminated. One thing you can get up go get popcorn or use the washroom and not miss much. I hope if Madonna releases another film she watches it first. My only salvation was it only cost me a buck in the Redbox I would have been upset if I had to pay for this in the theater.,W.E.

Some parts the lighting was a bit off but thats me knit-picking at it.Personally, I thought it was bloody marvellous overall.

The film is visually stunning, and the performances are all convincing and powerful, though never over-the-top as might have been expected. Madonna has put together a great screenplay with just the right emotional highlights, and then she executes the overall picture in the best way possible.

57,craighepworth,What are the critics thinking? A very strong film,10,20 January 2012,"I Just watched the film and really enjoyed it as did my partner, the critics have clearly taken a swipe at this to jump on the Madonna bashing band waggon (luckily a few critics have been able to be subjective). Whilst it's not perfect (15 Min's could be cut easy) it's a very strong effort and the performances are fantastic. I thought i would hate the modern day story but it actually worked for me, it took awhile for the modern story to take off (they could have got the point much earlier) but when it did it was very charming.Some critics have bashed it for scenes when the 2 women talk to each other, i thought these scenes were very strong and made total sense, Wally is going through something terrible and replaces living life with obsession over this story, it makes sense that she talks to her. The links between the 2 women (again despite what the press say) works, it helps that Wally is written as someone who grew up with the legacy of Simpson through her name. The moment she realised that her life would not go the same way as Simpson's did was brilliant and quite moving, in fact the whole scene where Wally read the letters was superb, every aspect of the film worked so well together in that moment.Some of the shots Madonna has chosen are wonderful, sweeping shots taking you high above the trees to end the Simpson scene and coming back down from the sky to ground level to start a new scene worked extremely well. The fight scene between Wally and her Husband was heartbreaking and violent but shot with such beauty, the same with the opening scene with Simpson's horrific attack. Her eye for visuals is very clear and the camera choices and movements should be applauded. It did not look like any film I have seen in a long time.For a film with only a 20 million budget it looks fantastic, the attention to detail is wonderful and the costuming is some of the best of the year (sadly I'm sure it will be overlooked come Oscar time). The score of this film is also magnificent.Andrea is giving one hell of a performance, James Darcy and Oscar Issacs are also great. Cornish does well but her role is a little underwritten, but on the moments she is given to shine she really does.I feel some of the modern day stuff could have been cut down to give more time to the Royal story line, but as for it debunking the film as some critics have suggested well that is just silly. The auction house is a perfect setting to take us back in time and to allow Wally's obsession to thrive. I would have liked to have seen more of Simpson and Edward falling in love as it was quite brief and in the modern story that they showed just how brutal the Husband could be before the big attack scene.However for me this was a strong film by all involved, you can tell much love has gone in to the project, especially from Madonna and Andrea. The critics have got this one very wrong, and should not be critics if they cannot review fairly (my job is as a theatre critic so i don't hate critics, i just hate when they use their power for attacking).Watch it for yourself, i think this will be a film that in a few years from now will have a very different reputation.8/10",W.E.

60,mad_men,"Different, Clever, Stunning",8,7 May 2012,"Normally, I don't like writing reviews but I feel this is an underrated and misunderstood film. It contains a few small spoilers.I guess it is almost impossible to watch it and review it without taking in consideration the director. Madonna.Let me start by saying that while I don't hate Madonna, I detest her as an actress and I watched this film with lots of skepticism and with very low expectations, after reading a few professional reviews. But it was a nice surprise, for sure.I found it to be a very different film to what the big studios are putting out. It's not completely fiction and it's not a straight-forward history lesson. It has both, and I find that's very original. It's much more of a concept film, than anything else.This film employs a plot device similar to the film Julie & Julia, but that's where the similarities end. I knew this before I watched it and I had already made up my mind that it was a cheap trick to connect with the audience, but this film takes it much further than the aforementioned film.The story has moments where the fictional Wally Winthrop and the real Wallis Simpson interact on the mind of the fictional character. That's where the conceptual aspect of the film lies, it is a film about ""celebrity"" and our obsessions with it. How we turn to them to love them or hate them and how they can be a reflection of our lives. Wally is completely obsessed with Wallis. In this film Madonna ""defends"" a female historical figure who was misunderstood and hated by a lot of people, it takes no genius to figure out that's how Madonna must feel at times herself. So at the same time, it is obvious the director feels a bit obsessed with Wallis as well. You'll notice how much of Madonna's words are uttered by Wally Winthrop.A great aspect of the film, is that it has many scenes that are quite shocking, and I won't list them here but it certainly shows difficult aspects of both women's lives in a very brave and bold way, especially those concerning abuse and child conception. And these matters are not only difficult for these women but for all women and can be truly felt by anyone with some humanity in them.The movie is probably a bit too long and some scenes towards the second half of the film could've been left out, but it's not such a big flaw. I completely disagree with reviewers who think Wallis Simpson should've been the central figure and the fictional side should've been cut to 15 minutes, that would be a completely different movie and not how this movie was intended to be to portray its ideas. A scene that stands out involves an elderly Wallis Simpson dancing for Edward, and it's very endearing. And while Andrea Riseborough is completely amazing as Wallis, not enough people are commenting on Abbie Cornish who made us feel for her character and her troubles, some scenes must have been a real challenge to film.To finish my review I have to talk about the most praised aspects of the film, and certainly what makes it stand out the most above the rest: it is absolutely and breathtakingly stunning, both the image on the screen and the soundtrack. The different cameras used and color palette, among other things, are both classic and modern. I feel the balancing of both is perfect in this film like in no other. The soundtrack is mostly based on classical pieces but in one of the scenes Wallis Simpson dances to the Sex Pistols. This is so we don't forget we are looking at this from the perspective of the fictional character, a modern woman.It is obvious a ton of work and thought has been put into every aspect of this film. It is no vanity project. See it and judge for yourself and I promise if you focus on what you're being shown, you will at least enjoy it.I loved it...",W.E.

The fact the couple spent most of their time in Paris France is not surprising, as the English population at that time were not to forgiving, and of course in today time. this activity of marring an American commoner would not even make the news.

If, say, you have tonight no embassy ball/film premiere to attend, then a trip to your movie theatre to see this will fill the void.If the genuine theme is misplaced love for celebrity, then Wally's is a (half-satisfying) story of redemption (ie with pregnancy she looks forward finally to a real future of her own); if instead it's about the Duchess as wronged heroine, it's a hearty effort but the sympathy that's generated for the dim but 100% non-evil prince (in this portrayal dotty, kind... and many other things the real David/Edward may not have been) makes the case hard to make.The world's been long littered with (famous and totally not) adventurers who played with dynamite once too often, and few will feel much for a pair who persisted in material splendour as the Duke and Duchess, for all their troubles, plainly did.Re. the modern story, I agree that it is overlong, and it slows down the whole thing towards the end, although not, fortunately, nearer the start.

I have to honestly say that is it is probably my favorite Madonna project besides music ever. Everything about this film impressed me from the costume, the lighting, the cast, but most importantly the the accuracy of the story and how Madonna was able to show a different side of the story. As a fan of The British Monarchy i had read a lot about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor but i never bothered to see the Duchess's side of the story and just what she had to go through, what she had to give up. Everyone always thinks about what King Edward VIII gave up, but they never take in consideration the hell she went through and that is what W.E. did for me it made me think and see it from her point of view. Once again Madonna has impressed me with her work, and honestly i don't care what the media says she did a great job directing this film. I am very proud to be a fan of such an intelligent, intellectual, brilliant, and talented artist who never cease to amaze me.",W.E.
68,ouatvagan,Madonna wasn't made for Directing. At all,6,2 March 2020,"I don't have a lot to tell, but I can convince everyone that this film does not have any reasons to be watched by someone unless you love the music of Abel Korzeniowski, it's really FABULOUS. Maybe, even better than in Nocturnal animals.",W.E.
69,fanfilm63,a 5 star out of 10,6,8 February 2012,"I have to disagree with most of the critics who have trashed this film. Overall the movie is not that bad. It is a half decent movie. However Madonna had missed the opportunity to make a very good period movie if she would have focused only on Wallis and Edward's story. It is quite fascinating the way she describe it and Andrea Riseborough lights up the screen entirely every time she is on. She could have been even more magnificent if she had more meat and she could have been nominated for awards, she also reminds me of Marion Cotillard in La vie en rose. The film is absolutely stunning during the period movie, the costumes are splendid to every details, the cinematography is grandiose and the score is beautiful but a bit overwhelming some times (again less is more). However, the problem is the modern part, which could have been another film entirely. I didn't really see the links between the 2 stories, other than Wally was named after Wallis and if she was fascinated by W.E. story and Abbie Cornish is not really convincing in the role, day dreaming through the entire movie. The connections between the periods were often not clear and pointless going back and forth all the time and not leaving enough time screen for the period movie. The modern part is also full of clichés, abused woman who wants to get pregnant who gets saved by her Prince Charming and become pregnant. Really Madonna, I would have expect more from you, it was a bit reductive. The scenes were Wally and Wallis meet are also a bit awkward. However Madonna has definitely a eye for filming, but the next time, please have someone else write you a very good script and please remember less is more because movies have to leave something to the imagination.",W.E.
70,laterdanish,Love conquers all?,10,25 October 2011,It's incredible to believe that this is the first major film Madonna has directed - and it's a real labour of love. 3 years have been spent making the movie and all the effort and hard work is right there in front of your eyes when you watch it.An amazing story and stunning performances - particularly from Andrea Riseborough as Wallis Simpson.The cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes and the costumes are wonderful. The piano led soundtrack is also another nice touch. I can still hear it playing in my ears now! It's ultimately a feminist statement about love and power. The entire production is stunning and Madonna's touch can be felt all over it.,W.E.
71,mignonwolf,Best version of this Romance,9,13 May 2012,"I am not a fan of Madonna, her music and previous film stints do not do it for me.But I bear the greatest respect for her, she has gone where angels fear to tread,she is a pioneer of women, and she makes me proud to be one. I do not understand why this movie got such bad reviews. I found it well directed, casted and filmed. It is wildly romantic and thoroughly worth your time. The costumes are stunning and the dialogue intriguing. Perhaps all the reviewers with negative comments were male? It has happened before, but this is no ""chick flick"". My husband really enjoyed it also. Well he is in touch with his feminine side, but like Madonna he has balls the size of butternuts",W.E.
72,TonySago,Not for everyone... but definitely for the open minded.,10,29 November 2011,"Last night I was fortunate enough to attend an advanced screening of the Madonna directed ""W.E."" and surprisingly loved it. What Madonna lacks as an actress, she more than makes up for as a director. ""W.E."" is a far cry from the ""cookie cutter"" biopic, drama or love story. It's all of those things and so much more. The visuals, the music, the cinematography, the acting... AMAZING! It's raw, passionate filmmaking at its best. One of the lead actresses, Andrea Riseborough, was there for a Q&A and received a much-deserved standing ovation from the audience. Her performance is definitely Oscar worthy... as is the entire film, including direction, cinematography, costume design, and score. I just hope all audiences (and critics) see this movie with an open mind, instead of with prejudice toward its iconic director. This film proves that Madonna has more to offer than controversial music videos and reinvented looks. P.S. The credits role to a new Madonna song called ""Masterpiece""... and it is!",W.E.
73,Thestart1,"Fantastic, compelling...",7,5 December 2011,"I will not be revealing any spoilers. I just want to highlight the fact that I can now confirm for myself that critics are jaded and they will write off anything Madonna does in the film business. That is not to say most of her previous works weren't dismal at best, but I always felt they weren't as bad as critics bashed. However, we're here to discuss W.E. A film that Madonna does not star in and that may just be the brilliance of it all. I screened it last night after winning a contest and I must say, as a Madonna fan, I walked in with the assumption that I wouldn't like the movie but I would search for little things that I could enjoy and emphasize those things. That had to be the last thing in the world I did once the film commenced. Even in the same room with Madonna and other fashionistas, celebrities and artists, I completely forgot where I was and I soon found myself captivated by the story.The intertwining of the old and new, historical loosely based romance with a modern romance, music old and new was brilliantly executed by Madonna. The film really emphasized how the general public scrutinize public figures and demonize others without a clear understanding of who they are and how politics can destroy the chance of love and how King Edward would ultimately not have that.Intertwined with the modern tale of a New York City woman who's fascinated by the story, there are flashbacks that go through the delicate history of the royal family in the particular time that Wallis Simpson, then married, met King Edward.. It is not a fact-by-fact story. It is an attempt to take a look at things from a different perspective because after all there are two sides to every story, if not more than two sides. Although set design, location and costume design were unbelievable, I will not speak further on it because critics said that that was the only thing good about the film so I'll let that speak for itself.Every character was played and executed brilliantly and it was just a captivating story from beginning to end. I take pride in my love for Madonna but I also take pride in my love for film and I walked in knowing I wouldn't lie to myself. If I liked it, I liked it. If I loved it, then so be it. If I hated it, oh well. Fortunately, I found that everyone in the audience was pleasantly surprised, almost as if they were cheering on the fact that it will be seen for what it is. That no one has to defend it. Leave it to the film-goer to make that desicion.The camera work was beautiful, slow but intermixed with a haunting score and pivotal performances. I really hope people watch it with an open mind and forget Madonna directed it. At least until the credits roll and her new song Masterpiece begins and you remember why we love Madonna in the first place. Her music is profound and the song Masterpiece is a beautiful closer to the film.After the film, everyone was energized and the buzz carried out into the halls where people stood discussing the film. I can't wait to re-watch it with my friends on Friday for its limited release and then once more at opening night on February 3rd.I will be buying this film for my DVD collection. It's worth it and that's more than I thought I'd ever say about it.***1/2(out of 5)",W.E.
74,mathewwillman,loved it!!!!!!,10,8 August 2013,"Wonderful film! I consider it to be one of the best, if not the best, film of 2011. I saw it on Redbox, read a brief summary, and decided, ""Oh, heck, I'll go with it."" And boy, am I glad. I am a huge fan for British films, romances, dramas, and tragedy's. The score is beautiful! The plot, I found fascinating. I loved how Madonna worked in the past and future of this story. I so much loved how she had a poor woman who's in a struggling relationship, to find comfort in a famous love scandal, despite her current circumstances. For I know, when I was in hard times, and not knowing where to turn, I was able to find comfort, security, and a way to escape life, if only for a little bit, in a simple story. So, I can connect with her on a personal level. The romance is beautiful, the plot, fascinating and intriguing at the same time. Madonna had an amazing cast, which I felt helped give the story its richness. And again, the score. I know I can't say this enough, but well done! Madonna hired a wonderful and amazing score writer, Abel Korzeniowski. I just listen to the score and dream in my own romantic fantasies, by it's sheer beauty. My mother saw me watching it (she came in on the last 30mins) not knowing what it was about, thought it was horrible. Well, a year went by, and I was in a dreamy state and felt like watching it again. Well, I sat down to watch it, and my mother joined my at the couch. Knowing it was that very same film she hated. She still watched it again, and at the end of the film......she loved it! She praised its glory and found out why I so dearly loved it, and now I can proudly say, she is a lover of this wonderful film. And I am glad to have changed her mind. I recommend this film to anyone. I am a male and I'm 16.",W.E.
75,rentboy828-262-26038,"Solid, Stylish Biopic",7,18 February 2019,"The cast alone makes this film worth watching. This was the first I watched with Oscar Isaac, and he truly generates heat in every scene with Abbi Cornish. Andrea Riseborough gives a star making performance that should have been recognized when the film was originally released. Madonna, as a director, knows how to let her cast do their thing and brings a stylish eye to the set design and costumes. Of course the critics were ready with their claws out but anyone who watches the film with an objective eye will be pleasantly rewarded.",W.E.
76,Shannon1960,Great Love Story? Maybe. Great movie? No,2,3 May 2012,"Madonna seems to have decided that she can write and direct a better movie about the British royal family than those who created The King's Speech. She was wrong. The modern pieces were distracting from the story of Wallis And Edward. Prior movies have done more justice in my opinion to the story of WE. I have read numerous books that have done a better job of telling this story. I'm always interested in learning more about things I'm studied for years. This was why I watched this film in the first place. The scenes from the lives of David and Wallis were okay, but I've seen better. And frankly there was nothing new to it. I have to wonder if this was an attempt by Madonna to one up her ex, Guy Ritchie.",W.E.
77,phamkhacha,Surprisingly good,10,30 May 2012,"I give it a 10 to make it up for all the unfairly bad reviews given by those narrow-minded people. Actually W.E is a really good movie. And I'm stunned by Madonna directing talent. The way she told the story is very appealing and professional, the movie visually beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing. The message is good. The cast also gave a great performance. W.E should deserve a 7 to say the least. It's too bad that the movie didn't get any major awards besides its original score. I guess the reason is that people don't want to see Madonna successful in other categories because her music career is unbelievable, they wanna keep her in the music box. That's human nature. You actually did it Madge. Cheers.",W.E.
78,zachary_nickerson-426-117878,A Good Movie Overlooked because of Madonna's History,9,18 July 2012,"8.5/10I began watching this movie expecting to ironically like it because it had Madonna's name on it. I expected a trashy, beautiful, skin-deep spectacle whose emotional depth was replaced by beauty. What I found was a very good movie whose small bumps were amplified because Madonna's name was listed under Director. Expecting to like this on the same level that I liked Filth and Wisdom (frivolously and embarrassedly), I was VERY surprised when this movie was what I was given. The movie's main characters are acted very well - Abbie Cornish's Manhattanite House Wife is not adoring mush and Andrea Riseborough's Thirties Trollop is not a charactature of an early Twentieth Century puppet. The music for the movie is superb, as are the costumes. And while this is not directing at its greatest, Madonna has done quite an amazing feat for having this be her first attempt as a Full Length Director (because did Filth and Wisdom count as a movie?). Because her name was on the credits, reviewers went into the movie looking for a witch hunt. In all reviews small complaints were blown out of proportion so that a pedantic, pretentious reviewer could give W.E. one star. Yes, Madonna had a few hiccups on the way, but no more than with any other first-time-director. Rollingstone (my Bible for movie reviews) gave it one out of four stars but neglected to voice why or where Madonna went wrong, but merely stated that she failed at directing.Many say that this movie is all fluff and no substance - which would be fine had Madonna's name not been on it. Remember Marie Antoinette or 2009's Oscar-Winning A Single Man? Those movies were all beauty and no plot and yet it was highly praised and one of my favorites. Why? Because the beauty was a commentary on the main character, just as it is in W.E.. Wallis was very much a woman of frippery, and Madonna showed that beautifully in both her (wee bit obvious) eye with the camera and her sometimes-subtle, sometimes- (hopefully)-obvious script. In all, I found this movie to be very good and I would love to see it again. I was expecting frippery to the Filth and Wisdom standard, but instead got a wonderful piece that should have been taken more seriously. The Oscars should have nodded at this film for more than its costumes in nominations for Andrea Riseborough, Abel Kornziowski, Madonna (for Masterpiece), and (big maybe) Madonna (for her directing). 8.5/10",W.E.
79,alice-459-963971,"I'm not a big Madonna fan, but I thought this movie was great!",8,25 August 2012,"This movie had a fresh point of view. It was beautifully filmed. In some ways it reminded me of Tom Ford's ""A Single Man"". I enjoyed that it had the added twist of being juxtaposed against a modern day relationship that also had problems. I can take or leave Madonna, but I did not read any reviews of this film until after I had seen it. I sometimes get the impression that critics love to hate Madonna. Her song at the end is definitely worth sitting through the credits. I gave it less than a 9 or 10 because it was a little slow, although I'm not sure there was a way to cure that without making the story suffer in some other way.",W.E.
80,dimitrioschondros,Underestimated,7,9 January 2021,"Not a masterpiece, but an interesting director's view on such a romance in two different ages. Clever scenario. Not bad at all.",W.E.
81,cbrewer-79494,Complete Rubbish,1,19 August 2018,What a diabolical waste of talent and subject matter. Madonna's directorial debut should stay that - one of the worst directed films I have ever seen. No doubt Madonna is a talented lady in many respects - but film directing is certainly not one of them.Don't waste your time with this rubbish.,W.E.
