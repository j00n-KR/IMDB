0,MartinHafer,A dissenting view from an old curmudgeon.,6,30 March 2013,"Well, perhaps I am not that old (it depends who you ask), but I am a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to this film. I know that TONS of people love this movie and it won the Best Picture Oscar, but it left me cold. In fact, the only part of the movie I really liked was the bizarre scene where Jack Nicholson was driving along the beach (you just have to see it). I never really felt much about the rest of the film. So, as folks weeped during the sequences where Deborah Winger played a woman battling cancer, I didn't particularly care. The film felt, to me, manipulative and I didn't think much about the characters or the mother-daughter relationship. But, as I said, I am a curmudgeon...and I also didn't like ""Steel Magnolias"", either. It isn't that I won't watch 'disease films' (after all, I am a cancer survivor), but not ones where I am not invested in the folks in the film. Sorry, but that's just my two-cents worth.",Terms of Endearment
1,bkoganbing,Mother & Daughter,8,25 August 2019,"Terms Of Endearment is a story of what happens when life does not go as planned and how you deal with it. In one way or another we are flawed humans,
but most of us can rise to the occasion if the situation calls for it. It gained an
Oscar at last for Shirley MacLaine and a second for Jack Nicholson though in the
Supporting character category.The story stretches out over a 30 year period and it starts with the death of MacLaine's husband early on and she's left to raise her daughter on her own.
As the daughter who grows up to be Debby Winger the two fight constantly.
She really doesn't approve of her choice of husband Jeff Daniels who is a
struggling academic who in the course of the movie has several teaching
positions and rises slowly in his profession. Not fast enough for MacLaine.
She reminds me of Madge Wallace the mother-in-law of Harry S. Truman who
never thought her son-in-law would amount to anything. She died in the
White House just before the Trumans left for Independence permanently.Winger has three children, but she's beset by doubts about Daniels's infidelity
as he does have nubile coeds all about. Both of them misread signals about
each other and MacLaine's hectoring doesn't help.As for Shirley, her neighbor is a retired astronaut Jack Nicholson who is still
looking for space groupies. He's an unlikely candidate to thaw MacLaine out,
but they find out they have more in common than they think. And Nicholson
has more character than we first suspect.Terms Of Endearment is a film that places people who are very much like the
people who pay to see this film in real universal situations we can all understand. Not hard to understand how this became such a critical and
popular hit.Terms Of Endearment won for Best Picture in 1983 and Best Director and Best
Adapted Screenplay for James Brooks. It got a flock more nominations as
well. It's an enduring classic and will remain so.The finale with MacLaine is sublimely beautiful.",Terms of Endearment
2,SnoopyStyle,wonderful mother daughter movie,9,11 December 2015,"Emma (Debra Winger) has had to deal with her widowed mother Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) since the beginning. Aurora is needy, wild, flirtatious and really the love of her life. Hard-partying former astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson) moves in next door. Emma marries Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) despite Aurora's warnings and her backhanded insults. Aurora doesn't even go to the wedding. The marriage gets into trouble and she has an affair with Sam Burns (John Lithgow).Terms of Endearment is utterly endearing. Debra Winger is hilarious and I love her relationship with MacLaine. I just love Winger yelling at her kids and then quickly switches back. A lot of praise has to be given to director/writer James L. Brooks. This is funny, touching and a real tear jerker. Winger talking to her kids on her death bed is incredibly heart breaking.",Terms of Endearment
3,mark.waltz,Take a whack at the steel magnolia that is Aurora.,8,24 January 2017,"When the film version of ""Steel Magnolias"" came out in 1989, there were plenty of people who must have commented on the similarities of that plot to ""Terms of Endearment"", especially since Shirley MacLaine, after winning an Oscar for that film, took on a character supporting part with two time Oscar winning Sally Field taking over the role of the long-suffering mom. Fields' M'Lynn is as far from Aurora Greenway as Debra Winger's Emma is from Julia Roberts' Shelby, but indeed, this is a film about the relationship of mothers and daughters that seems quite poignant in light of the recent Carrie Fisher/Debbie Reynolds tragedy. MacLaine's Aurora is really her first middle aged crank, moving from her eccentrics of the 1950's and 60's to what she would perfect as Ouiser Boudreaux. Aurora Greenway is a kinder, gentler version of Ouiser, but she's no wimp and she's probably even more uptight than Ouiser was. It will take a lot of drinks to kill the bug she has, and that comes thanks to the astronaut neighbor who annoys her at first with his drunken carousing but opens her up to a world of middle age sexual awakening when somehow he endears himself to her.That astronaut is Jack Nicholson, played with brassy vigor and well deserving of another Oscar. Certainly, he's fat and disgusting at times, but that's the joy of his character; He knows he's fat and disgusting, but he loves life and isn't stopping for a moment of sobriety and chastity under any circumstance. MacLaine is first seen worrying over baby Emma, assured unsuccessfully by her husband that it hasn't died of crib death, and MacLaine hardly mourns her husband without even a single tear. She tolerates Lisa Hart Carroll as Patsy, Emma's best friend, but can't stand Emma's choice for a husband to be, the handsome but prankish Jeff Daniels who stands up to MacLaine with every nasty remark she dishes out. MacLaine's Aurora is temperamental, but not without heart, and as the film unravels, she becomes a fascinating amalgamation of moods and personality traits. As for Winger, it's a very direct performance, and while MacLaine steals the film right out from under her, it is probably the real off screen animosity between the two that made them better. Dislike of any kind brings out passion, especially in actors, and in fact, they seem more like mother and daughter than Field and Roberts did in ""Steel Magnolias"". That film was far more colorful and flamboyant with its ensemble cast of family and friends surrounding them, but ""Terms"" is quite direct. John Lithgow, coming off his flamboyant role as the transgendered ex-football player in ""The World According to Garp"", is a pillar of quiet strength who helps Winger through some rough times involving Daniels' infidelity as she helps him deal with his own inner storm surrounding his own wife who is unable to have sex.MacLaine is of course best known for the ""Give her the shot!"" scene when the film takes its soap opera twist at the end, showing the strength that women have when it comes to dealing with family trauma and the undying loyalty they have for their children. It's certainly as poignant as Fields' ""I wanna know why!"" cry for understanding in ""Steel Magnolias"", and perhaps the reason Fields did not get the Oscar nomination many (including myself) felt she deserved for that was that the memory of MacLaine in ""Terms of Endearment"" overshadowed her. This was recently re-written as an Off Broadway play (starring Molly Ringwald!) that in light of the movie's less than stellar cult status seemed unnecessary to be done. I can't get enough of the musical theme by Michael Gore, and indeed, the script and direction by Joseph Brooks is excellent. However, after much thought, I find that ""Terms of Endearment"" does not hold up as the Best Picture of 1983, although I couldn't imagine anybody else winning an Oscar for Best Actress that year other than Shirley MacLaine.",Terms of Endearment
4,gavin6942,Fun Little Relationship Movie,7,18 September 2015,"Aurora and Emma are mother and daughter who march to different drummers. Beginning with Emma's marriage, Aurora shows how difficult and loving she can be. The movie covers several years of their lives as each finds different reasons to go on living and find joy.This is a fairly subtle comedy. Some could call it a drama because it is about relationships and how they succeed or fail. There is plenty of doubt and infidelity to go around here. And a solid cast behind the characters (Debra Winger may have the role of her career here).To me, it is all about the comedy. The neurotic actions of parents, and especially some of the mannerisms of Jack Nicholson. Can you see Burt Reynolds in the role? Perhaps, but it would have been so different. They just have such different styles. Nicholson has the quirky strength, whereas Reynolds could have been more suave, perhaps.",Terms of Endearment
5,lee_eisenberg,I want there to be a festival of movies focusing on families,8,9 April 2020,"James L. Brooks had been working in TV for a number of years when he turned to the big screen. He made his directorial debut with ""Terms of Endearment"", which went on to win Best Picture, Actress, and some others. While the motif of dysfunctional families is a common one in cinema, this movie still bears watching, with Shirley MacLaine as the widowed matriarch whose strained relationship with her daughter (Debra Winger) proliferates. And I mean that there are some severe things in store.Many of the characters make you feel as if you're walking on eggshells, even as you understand that they're trying to do the right thing. Aside from MacLaine and Winger, there's also Jeff Daniels's professor, Jack Nicholson's astronaut, and others. Just as with ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", some of the scenes featuring children are enough to make one want to not have children.In the end, I think that it did a fine job looking at these different relationships within the family. Basically, it's about the sorts of things that happen in real life (even if not every specific thing here befalls every family). As for whether or not it deserved its Oscar wins, it's hard to say, considering that we had plenty of good movies that year (Scarface, The Big Chill, The Year of Living Dangerously, Tender Mercies, The Right Stuff).And yes, I'd like to see a festival of movies focusing on families and their relationships. Along with this movie there would have to be ""The Subject Was Roses"", ""I Never Sang for My Father"", ""Grand Canyon"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Death at a Funeral"" (the original, not the remake).",Terms of Endearment
6,jboothmillard,Terms of Endearment,8,7 April 2007,"Based on a best selling novel, this is a good directorial debut from the director of As Good as It Gets and producer of The Simpsons, James L. Brooks, he even won the Oscar, and was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Director. Basically it is all about the relationships between the Greenway and Horton family. Emma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Debra Winger) is now part of the Horton family, being married to Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), and her mother Aurora (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Shirley MacLaine) is finding it difficult to be loving. The film explores the running few years of all their lives, as each character finds different reason to be living and be happy. Aurora has a very close relationship with local cheeky retired astronaut, Garrett Breedlove (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Jack Nicholson), and apparently the next neighbour as well. But the film is also a story of life, and loss, showing their loves in different ways, best summed up with the dying of Emma from the AIDS virus. Also starring Danny DeVito as Vernon Dahlart and Oscar nominated John Lithgow as Sam Burns. There are many giggly moments, but for me it is Nicholson that made the film great. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Michael Gore and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Terms of Endearment
7,moonspinner55,Quirky characters who eventually grow on you,8,30 November 2002,"The shifty, funny/serious tone of ""Terms Of Endearment"" caught a lot of people off guard in 1983 and word-of-mouth about it being a seriously good tearjerker/comedy was strong (opening near Christmas probably didn't hurt it come Oscar time either!). But since then, TV sitcoms have been mining this kind of flippant, edgy, raw sense of dynamics (""Roseanne"" comes to mind), and ""Terms"" doesn't seem as fresh. Watching it again the other night, I couldn't help feeling some of the juice was missing, or that Shirley MacLaine's Aurora Greenway was actually more of an irritant than a sympathetic harridan. But on closer inspection, the lives of these characters are quite endearing, and the tender music on the soundtrack always underlines a poignant scene at just the right moment. Vivid Debra Winger is incredible as MacLaine's daughter, as are John Lithgow, Jeff Daniels, Jack Nicholson and, in a small but telling part, Danny DeVito. As for MacLaine, I think she makes a few missteps in her characterization, and I didn't like the scene where she leaves her own birthday party in a huff and finds herself at Nicholson's door--it feels put on--or her famous scene with Jack driving on the beach, which is highly improbable. However, her determined will and loving possessiveness/detachment towards her daughter makes her a complicated and colorful bundle of nerves. The picture is flawed, yet has scenes of worth and love, many memorable lines of dialogue, and shows a real skill for balancing different moods. *** from ****",Terms of Endearment

Had she been in the supporting category instead, she may very well have won.As the astronaut flinging for romance, Jack Nicholson garnered the best supporting actor Oscar.

9,sunwarrior13,A Classic Tearjerker,10,27 September 2012,"Terms of Endearment is a drama adapted from the novel by Larry McMurtry. It features Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, and Jack Nicholson together with Danny DeVito,Jeff Daniels and John Lithgow. It covers thirty years of the relationship between Aurora Greenway and her daughter Emma.It was written and directed by James L.Brooks.Fiercely protected by Aurora throughout childhood, Emma runs into resistance from her mother when she marries wishy-washy college teacher Flap. Aurora is even more put out at the prospect of being a grandmother, though she grows a lot fonder of her three grandkids than she does of her son-in-law. Flap proves that Aurora's instincts were on target when he enters into an affair with a student. Meanwhile, Emma finds romantic consolation with an unhappily married banker. As for Aurora, she is ardently pursued by her next-door neighbor, boisterous astronaut Garrett Breedlove. After 75 minutes or so of pursuing an episodic, semi-comic plot line, the film abruptly shifts moods when Emma discovers that she has terminal cancer. This is a classic tearjerker.It isn't shy about reaching for the heartstrings but is so well-acted and smartly scripted that it's almost impossible to resist.The most remarkable achievement of this film is its ability to find the balance between the funny and the sad, between moments of deep truth and other moments of high ridiculousness.This is one of the best movies ever made.",Terms of Endearment

11,Theo Robertson,Will Endear Itself To An American Daytime Audience,6,21 November 2012,"It's interesting that this movie dominated the Oscars the year it was released . Likewise it made over 100 million dollars at the American box office something that wasn't all that common nearly 30 years ago . It didn't do nearly as well commercially at the international box office and was ignored at the international award ceremonies such as the BAFTAs' . One instinctively feels that this might be because it's a film produced for an American audience and after seeing it for the first time these instincts are totally confirmed . It's also a film that never feels cinematic either and left me feeling is that it ?Director James L Brooks is someone who is familiar to the medium of television and created the great American comedy show TAXI with TERMS OF ENDEARMENT being his first directorial journey in cinema . This explains the whole look and feel of the film - it often seems like you're watching one of those TVMs from the Living Channel . The story involves two female protagonists a mother and daughter who don't get on so much so that the mother snubs her daughter's wedding with the story then following the fall-out from that just like you've seen in most of these TVMs . The film even has one of those "" cute but irritating "" kids so beloved by made for television family fare What stops TERMS OF ENDEARMENT being a complete waste of time is the high grade cast who do manage a likable on screen chemistry . It goes without saying Jack Nicholson lights up the screen . You can claim that once again you're watching Jack Nicholson play Jack Nicholson but a film like this needs this type of actor . Perhaps the best performance though belongs to John Lithgow as shy ,lonely man Sam Burns As said the cast save this film which struggles to feel like a cinematic picture and perhaps the fact that it won 5 Oscars exceeded all my expectations because this feels like a film that never escapes the TVM feel and seems one of the weakest films ever to win the Oscar for best picture",Terms of Endearment
12,preppy-3,"You'll laugh, you'll cry...",8,7 June 2000,"OK, I love the film, but I don't deny that it's very manipulative (especially in a hospital scene at the end with Winger and her kids). It's totally engrossing, has believable characters and situations and all the acting is great (especially Shirley MacLaine--she really won her Oscar for this movie). But it gets very sad and depressing towards the end. Still, you're not upset after it's over--the very end is actually uplifting. Well worth seeing.",Terms of Endearment
13,grantss,Sweet and emotional...but slow,7,16 September 2014,"The Best Picture Oscar winner of 1984. Sweet and emotional...but slow.A good character-driven drama that takes too long to get to the point. I suppose, in this movie's case especially, it is much more about the journey than the destination.And what a journey it is. It is filled with emotional moments, sweet moments and some humorous moments. The dialogue is fresh, snappy and engaging.What drives the movie, however, is the performances. Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are superb in the lead roles. While MacLaine ended up getting the Best Actress Oscar, Winger was also nominated for it and deserved it more. She gave her character a rare effervescent and lightness which was incredibly engaging. MacLaine's character was much darker and curmudgeonly and a bit more one-dimensional, so less engaging or intriguing. Great support from Jack Nicholson (especially) and Jeff Daniels. Nicholson is particularly good as the retired astronaut and playboy, bringing every ounce of charm, yet with traces of vulnerability, to his role. He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Not sure how John Lithgow got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He doesn't have that much screen time, and his performance, while solid, is not special.As mentioned, the main negative is that it takes so long to get to the point. The ending seems rather underwhelming too - I would have expected something more profound after such a long build-up.",Terms of Endearment
14,evanston_dad,Pass Me a Barf Bag,4,8 February 2008,"Blech!! A gloopy soap opera starring Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger as a contentious mother/daughter duo, whose on-again/off-again relationship culminates in the daughter dying of cancer in one of the most emotionally manipulative plot developments in the history of cinema.Both MacLaine and Winger are too good to waste their talents on this, but it's only because of their wisecracking smart-ass personalities that the film is watchable at all. Jack Nicholson, as a retired astronaut who cozies up to MacLaine, gives us all an inkling of the actor he would eventually turn into, all sarcastic smirking and self-conscious mugging.I especially hate the way this movie looks. It's gauzy and padded, all big hair and bigger shoulder pads. Nothing ever looks like it's completely in focus.Grade: D+",Terms of Endearment
15,AlsExGal,Shows that parents and children often love each other without liking each other,8,3 March 2016,"Terms of Endearment is a good exploration of the fact that parents don't often like their children even though they may love them, and children often have a hard time liking their parents when they turn out to be 100% correct - on the long haul - about the people they choose as spouses. Especially when the parents never let the child forget about the mistakes they have made. It also shows that death has a way of rewriting the past - often immediately.Emma falls in love and marries at a young age - about twenty. Her mother, Aurora, apparently married a man who was well off but died young. Aurora is controlling, illustrated in the first scene when she gets up to make sure Emma is breathing when she is an infant. Emma thinks she'll ""be happy in a one room shack and she won't look back"" when she marries poor young college teacher Flap Horton. And then the babies start coming, and keep on coming. At this point Flap and Emma prove they are quite flappable. Flap cheats because he can, and with a woman who is more like himself, more like the woman he probably would have married had he been older when he made that decision. Emma eventually cheats because she is drowning - in bills, in lack of emotional support, with an oldest son who sees the lack of respect everybody else gives his mother and apes the behavior.Then there is Jack Nicholson's place in all of this. As the aging astronaut who lives next door to Aurora, he is the only one who can get Aurora to fall off her pedestal as high priestess of perfect and emotionally detached decisions, and then she is terribly disappointed and surprised when he bolts as he feels the walls of monogamy closing in on him. Quite frankly, I was surprised that she was surprised that this happened.Some people have told me this is just an awful soap opera, but I disagree. Maybe a little bit because I have an aunt who trod the same tragic path as Emma, and maybe because I am also an exiled Texan who was a bit dismayed at the ""lack of wildness in the people"" in the state where I would spend the next quarter of a century. But then, I loved this film before any of those things happened.At any rate, highly recommended for the human drama of it all that hasn't really aged in 33 years. The only thing that lets you in on the fact that you are in a different time is Carol King's ""It's Too Late"" from 1971 playing as Aurora looks out the window at one point.",Terms of Endearment

I don't usually like Debra Winger, but she gives an incredible performance in the film. It's easy to see why she was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars alongside Shirley MacLaine, although it's sad that in such a contest one woman will inevitably lose. Shirley MacLaine won, largely due to the famous and often spoofed ""Give my daughter her shot!"" scene.Jeff Daniels, John Lithgow, and Jack Nicholson provide the male talent, and each give great performances without overshadowing the women; after all, the movie belongs to Shirley and Debra. There are a few humorous moments, but keep in mind that it's a heavy drama. Don't be fooled by the cuteness of the opening scene.I'm not going to spoil the plot, or even tell you anything about it. It's a story about a mother and her daughter, simple as that. Sometimes they get along, sometimes they don't, but they love each other more than most people love in their entire lives. Everyone—yes, I mean everyone—will bawl during this movie. If you love your mother, hate your mother, have a complex relationship with your mother (or daughter), are extremely close or wish you'd been closer—everyone will bawl.

Jack Nicholson picked up his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as the aging astronaut neighbor of Aurora who fall in love with each other.

21,JamesHitchcock,Lachrymose and Sentimental,5,30 July 2004,"Contains SpoilersIt is interesting that a previous reviewer refers to Shirley MacLaine's character (whose real name is Aurora) as Endora. I am not sure whether this is a deliberate witticism or a Freudian slip, but it struck me as highly appropriate. Aurora is very similar, both in looks and in personality, to Agnes Moorehead's old witch from the 1960s television show 'Bewitched'. (I was even more delighted to discover that Shirley MacLaine has been cast as Endora in the cinema version of 'Bewitched' due to be released next year).Like Endora, Aurora disapproves of her son-in-law and never misses an opportunity to interfere in her daughter's marriage. At the beginning of the film the daughter, Emma, is engaged to be married to a young university teacher, named Flap. (He appears to be the sort of person who only has a nickname rather than a Christian name). Aurora disapproves of the marriage, largely because she thinks that Emma could do better than to marry an academic, and refuses to attend the wedding. After this beginning, I found myself hoping that their marriage would be a blissfully happy one, not because either of them is a particularly sympathetic character but because Aurora is such an unsympathetic one that I could not bear the thought of her being proved right. Unfortunately, blissfully happy marriages do not generally make for exciting drama, and so it was quite predictable that Emma and Flap's marriage would eventually break down. Flap forms a suspiciously close relationship with one of his female students (it is not clear if their relationship is ever consummated) and, in revenge, Emma begins an affair with a local bank manager named Sam. Emma and Sam are parted, however, when Flap takes a new job and the family have to move house; when Emma finds out that he has done so in order to be near his girlfriend, she leaves him. Soon afterwards, she is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Interwoven with the story of the marriage of Flap and Emma is Aurora's own romance with her next-door neighbour, a former astronaut named Garrett Breedlove, played by Jack Nicholson. This is not, perhaps, one of Nicholson's really great performances, such as 'Five Easy Pieces', 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'A Few Good Men', but it is nevertheless a good one, and easily the best thing about the film. The cynical, hard-drinking, womanising Breedlove is about as different from the 'Right Stuff' image of the astronaut as one could imagine, and the film is always at its most entertaining when he is on screen. Unfortunately, he is not on screen for much of the time, and the rest of the cast are less interesting. Shirley MacLaine's character is an over-the-top caricature. (I found myself wondering why a man like Breedlove, surrounded as he was by attractive girls, should have settled for an eccentric older woman). In other films such as 'An Officer and a Gentleman', 'Black Widow' or 'Betrayed' Debra Winger came across as an attractive and vivacious actress, but here, as Emma, she can arouse little interest. Both Jeff Daniels as Flap and John Lithgow as Sam seemed weak and spineless; Emma was clearly fated to be attracted to men with little about them. (I wonder whether residents of the American Mid-West were offended by the implication that Flap could only find jobs in supposedly unglamorous places like Iowa and Nebraska because he was not a great success in his career). To judge from the number of Oscars and Oscar nominations that it won, the film was obviously highly regarded at the time it was made. 1983 was not perhaps the greatest year in the history of the movies, but there were nevertheless some much better films in contention, such as 'Silkwood', 'Yentl' and 'Educating Rita', none of which were, in the event, even nominated. That Shirley MacLaine beat Meryl Streep and Julie Walters to 'Best Actress' is incredible, explicable only if one assumes that the Academy were suffering pangs of guilt over MacLaine's four previous fruitless ""Best Actress"" nominations. Only Nicholson's 'Best Supporting Actor' award was deserved. However popular the film was in its day, today it looks like an eighties update of 'Love Story', a lachrymose and sentimental piece of schmaltz, and one of the weakest films to have taken the 'Best Picture' award in recent years. 5/10, largely because of Nicholson's performance.",Terms of Endearment

What I love about him is the way he executes his characters. He understands his character a little too much, but that just goes on to say how talented and sound he is.Coming to the acting department, Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are bloody good. They give their characters everything. Jeff Daniels is superb, while Jack Nicholson is just about okay. John Lithgow excels.On the whole, 'Terms Of Endearment' is indeed a must watch. Surely, Two Thumbs Up!",Terms of Endearment
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Good, but I wasn't impressed",6,4 May 2007,"Terms of Endearment is a well received movie that won critic's and audience's hearts in the 80's, not to mention how it snabed several Oscars including Best Picture of 1983, but I'm not so sure if it still has the same effect for today. While there were some moments that were funny and touching, the movie seemed to me like it was not well edited, everything went extremely fast and I couldn't keep up with what time the movie was going, it went from a year to next shot 10 years later without us even knowing. But I have to tell you that the only thing that really won my heart over was Jack Nicolson's character, Garrett, he was so charming and funny, I just absolutely fell in love with him.Emma and her mother Aurora are completely different, Aurora seems to really dislike Emma's husband, Flap, and Emma wants her mother to fall in love again. When Aurora notices the next door neighbor, Garrett, she starts to date him and eventually feels the scary emotion of love. Emma is going through a tough marriage though when she realizes how much of her life she's given up, but she is diagnosed with cancer and then soon comes to realize how everything she has was wonderful and she would never do it over again.Some of the emotions in this movie were just not well explained and the time that was expanded throughout the film was not edited well. Those were my main complaints, I'm sure you'll know what I mean when you see this movie. But still Shirly and Jack did a terrific job, they worked so well together and were just lovely. Unfortunately, this movie has just lost it's effect throughout time, it was the 80's, what can you say? 6/10",Terms of Endearment
24,sddavis63,Great Cast And A Solid Story,8,31 August 2019,"IN one sense ""Terms Of Endearment"" is a typical melodrama that revolves around family dynamics - mostly disfunctional family dynamics - that turns into a bit of a tear jerker in its closing scenes. It revolves mostly around the relationship between Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and Emma (Debra Winger) - a mother and daughter with a sometimes tense but always loving relationship characterized from the beginning of the film (when Emma was shown as a baby) by Aurora's over-protectiveness of her daughter. That over-protectiveness hangs over Emma throughout her life, extending finally into her own marriage. MacLaine and Winger both put on superb performances. And whle the story is melodramatic, it's better than your typical soapy movie. The characters are interesting. It really is fascinating to watch Aurora's evolution after she falls for her astronaut neighbour (played by Jack Nicholson) and suddenly starts to find some fun in her life, and some meaning beyond simply being Emma's mother. The supporting cast (with people like Jeff Daniels and Danny DeVito and John Lithgow) are strong, and the transformation of the movie into a tear jerker toward the end is actually handled very well and is very moving.What I most liked about this picture was that, in its own way, it was a believable movie. I found that I could relate to the characters and situations. This was a multiple Oscar winner - for Best Picture and for James Brooks as Best Director, as well as wins for MacLain and Nicholson for their performances. They were all well deserved.

25,gridoon,"A little heavy, but with astonishing performances.",7,10 April 2001,"A well-observed, well-made drama (with occasional comedic moments), that may not be exactly ""high art"" (it's neither profound nor original), but DOES feature some great acting and manages to pull you in. Debra Winger gives an extraordinary performance; she has a naturalness and expressiveness that you rarely see on the screen. When her character is happy, her whole face brightens up and her joy becomes infectious; when she's sad or confused or embarrassed, the emotions come across strongly, although she never goes over the top. Considering that she lost the Oscar to her co-star, Shirley MacLaine, who is reasonably good but far more one-note, I'd say we had a major Academy Award injustice there. Jack Nicholson is fun to watch and has some amusing lines, and most supporting roles, like those played by John Lithgow and Danny De Vito, are also first-rate and completely believable. So overall it's a good film, directed almost flawlessly, although in the final 20 minutes it needlessly wallows in melodrama. (***)",Terms of Endearment
26,ElMaruecan82,As comedic and dramatic as life can get ...,9,1 April 2012,"Sometimes, I surprise myself by being sad during a happy family occasion like a wedding or a birthday party, when it makes me realize how old someone who's very dear to me is getting, or how fast life can go. And some other times, as we're mourning the passing of a beloved family member, I find myself sitting at a table, laughing at the jokes of my uncle, or remembering some funny anecdotes involving the one who's not with us anymore. Go figure why, but we humans have this strange tendency to lean over a feeling that is opposite to the situation we endure, like a sort of defensive reaction. Happiness reminds us how we must seize the day, and death how great it is to live. So that's it, we laugh when we should be sad and cry when we should laugh. Actually, life teaches us that there's no 'should' when it comes to feelings, and its beauty is to make us swing back and forth between happy and sad memories. And to a certain extent, faithful to this very comedic aspect that can't go without a few tears, ""Terms of Endearment"" embodies the passing of life as this big joke with a sad punch line: we all laugh, have great time, but every once in a while, a sad event comes to remind us what is waiting for us. It follows a streak of successful Best Picture winning family dramas, such as ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" and ""Ordinary People"", but ""Terms of Endearment"" is slightly superior in the way it dares to approach life with an intelligent mix of detachment and irony but never without a profound and inspiring humanism.Still, what a strange film! No wait, I shouldn't even use the word 'film' because by no chances, does it try to exploit some cinematic conventions in order to extract the right feelings from its audience. Albert Brooks not only trusts our intelligence but also our patience as the story plunges us in the world of Aurora and Emma, Shirley MecLaine and Debra Winger, mother and daughter. I say 'strange' film because it has the curious feel of a TV movie without the archetypes of a vulgar soap opera, it's made with a modest tone of pastel colors and following an episodic structure, like so many slices of people's lives, people no worse or better than you and I, but the flow is so fluid and perfect that we let ourselves guided by the story, never really expecting for something to happen, we're just put here as witnesses of a story, which exemplifies our own vision of life.And that's the remarkable exploit of the film, the key that forged its success. ""Terms of Endearment"", which is unlike any film made before, was one of the highest grossing of 1983 and although I found ""The Right Stuff"" to be a much more extraordinary experience (and most deserving of the Best Picture award), ""Terms of Endearment"" possesses an endearing quality, which relies on its faithful approach to life, something made of laughs, anger, sadness and fears, simply put the four main emotions that drive our feelings. ""Terms of Endearment"" finds the perfect tone and balance between laughs and sadness, comic and pathos. In a way, the film can remind of ""Love Story"" without an hyperbolic classicism that could have ruined it.Emma the daughter, has this burning passion in her heart just like Ali McGraw's character and her mother works as the total opposite, she seems cold and distant, criticizing all her daughter's choices, above them all the decision to marry a teacher named Flap (Jeff Daniels). But Emma never decides, she just lives while Aurora uses her maturity and status as a courted widow to better not to look at her own issues. The interactions between Emma and Aurora seems so genuine that I wondered if the two actresses were really mother and daughter. You could tell that these two women were the best friends in the world, with this unique complicity that couldn't only be translated into awkward reactions. One of the biggest issues that undermine the characters' interactions is the impossible communication of true feelings and the way it's handled provides the comedic spice of the film.At a pivotal moment, Aurora finally decides to invite Garrett Breedlove, the ex-astronaut, neighbor since years and infamous for his lust for younger women, just to see her 'Renoir', referring to a very precious painting -a second reading at these lines makes the whole situation subtly hilarious. And not only this role was so tailor-made for Nicholson that it earned him his second Oscar win, but Mac Laine is the perfect match for him, and Brooks knew how to build a believable chemistry between them. At one point, Garrett makes a whole rhapsody about the way he feels things are getting too serious for his taste, to be interrupted by Aurora's reactions, it's funny but it also shows that not only she's no fool, but she doesn't even feel hurt. The film avoids two opposite clichés, turning them into derision to better show the futility of all that stuff. Another crucial scene is Emma's monologue in New York City on the way she feels about people's problems, an extraordinary moment I don't want to spoil. The film evolves beautifully with a last act that is forever rooted in our memories, thanks to the remarkable performances of both Debra Winger and Shirley MacLaine, surrounded by great supporting performances. The film doesn't feature iconic moments, isn't renowned for a particular quote, but it has a level of emotionality that has often been copied but never equaled. And to give you an idea if you haven't seen it yet, just listen to Michael Gore's magnificent theme and it will give you an idea.",Terms of Endearment

One of the Best Acted Movies of All Time,9,4 November 2014,"It's not often that we get films that give us true emotion and feels real enough to where we forget it's actually a movie we are watching. Terms of Endearment is one of the greatest films of all time. It gives us easily one of the best acted movies we have ever had. Shirley MacLaiine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, and John Lithgow give us classic performances in one of the more emotional movies I have seen.It's about a mother and daughter relationship that has had many ups and downs but when push comes to shove they realize how much they mean to each other. What I appreciated most was the realism this film displayed. They take situations and problems that families deal with on a day to day basis and brought them to film without throwing in any movie clichés. It's told over a several year span and not once during the movie do you stop and think ""oh well it's just a movie"". It truly speaks to life and how things actually are. However hard it is to appreciate the people and things you have now, you have to, because you don't know how long you have with them.MacLaine is the major standout and has a number of memorable scenes, particularly with Winger. They make their relationship an unforgettable experience to see on screen. I think Jeff Daniels was a bit miscast and played the same one note character he did in The Purple Rose of Cairo. I have yet to really see the world class actor in Daniels what everyone else sees. There are also a few times where I had hoped to see more about the family at a certain time in their lives. They skip a few years every few scenes and sometimes right when the tension was rising.A few mistakes here and there don't make this film any less extraordinary. It's really refreshing to see a film that exhibits emotion that normal film just cant compete with. It's not only an incredibly acted movie but also one of the greatest films of all time. There are few films that have effected me this much and just made me appreciate the life that I have.+MacLaine and Winger give all time great performances +Exhibits true emotion +Mother daughter relationship unlike any other +Real life situations with real life consequences +Thought provoking -Frustrating skips in time 9.5/10",Terms of Endearment

30,secondtake,"The drama of life, told with charmed realism and not overdoing the sentiment.",7,9 May 2010,"Terms of Endearment (1983)With three knockout performances and a heart wrenching story, there is enough substance here to get it through a few short improbabilities and clichés. With its sledgehammer ending, all the humor and playful romancing ends up being a set-up for the final act, making it that much more powerful. Director James Brooks shows a feel for real interactions in a very normal sense, and this is his first of only five completed films (another being As Good As It Gets, which has a couple echoes to this one). It isn't a brilliant or original film at all, but it's sincere, and seems to touch on themes of the times (and ours) in a meaningful way.So who are the three? Well, easily Debra Winger steals the show for warmth and life, and she is, in a way, the one pure spirit throughout. Shirley MacLaine has a more idiosyncratic role, and she pours herself into it with amazing clarity and conviction. And then, in a slightly smaller role but equally important, Jack Nicholson manages his best, charming, audacious, slightly selfish type. The interwoven interactions between these, and a few others, is the core of the film.The movie is more important for its events than for how it's made, but it's a solid piece in all. And notable, and noticeable, is the editing by the fabulous Richard Marks, for which he won an Oscar nomination.And life happens, without too much sweetener.",Terms of Endearment

It starts off engrossing with some excellent character development involving Debra Winger, and the dysfunctional relationship with her Mother (Shirley MacLaine) The relationship between Debra Winger & Jeff Daniels becomes full of dissension, and that's when I started to become uncomfortable (in a good way) . I would have to say this movie is the definition of a tearjerker, but it puts your emotions all over the place. It managed to convey my emotions from happy to sad, happy to sad, etcetera. Debra Winger is excellent in the lead, and Shirley MacLaine is her match as the arrogant Mother. As her relationship with Nicholson evolves, she became more and more likable as the movie went on. Jack Nicholson is the one who steals the show as the boorish drunk. He often had me in stitches, and as his character evolved, I began to develop a huge liking to him. Nicholson is at his best here. I'd have to say it deserved best picture. The ending is one of the most heartbreaking you'll ever see, and when this movie is over, you'll be thinking about it, long after it's over. 10/10",Terms of Endearment

35,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Most Overrated Oscar Winner Ever..? Probably YES !,6,21 May 2020,"Terms Of Endearment (1983) :
Brief Review -The Most Overrated Oscar Winner Ever..? Probably Yes. The first thing came in my mind before watching the film was, yes i am gonna watch a Best Picture winner at Oscar so i prepped myself up for a good film in worst case and then the First thing came in my mind after finishing this film is the first line you read at the beginning. This crap won Best Picture at Oscars? Seriously? I would have hesitated to give it even a nomination. Terms of Endearment was potentially a good emotional story but heavily spoiled and completely destroyed by wild characterisation. The story of a mother and a daughter and 2 other important supporting characters doesn't have a single sensible character in the film. I don't understand what kind of American culture it was. I never accepted shameless affairs in any film, doesn't matter even if it's a popular film. I was a just looking for some sense out there but it came to disappoint me again and again. The mother, the daughter both were so wild and open that i never cared for them. Both can have affairs out there with zero shame, both are shameless, both are idiots actually. Then why would have i cared about their lives and problems? Because as a sensible human you connect to sensible characters, not to insensible ones. Even those 2 supporting characters in the film were insensible. I meam how can a woman fall in love for someone who doesn't love her just fir the sake of sex and then ask for love? How can a married woman have an affair with other married man and then bash her own husband for having an affair? Does it really make sense? How come not single character in the film is living happily married life? Such idiotic characterisation was never meant to make emotional connect with me and so Terms of Endearment went rough, dry and unnoticed for me. I hope it had sensible characterisations or even simple in worst case would have done it to fulfill strong performances of all the actors. Now just because of bad writing i had to hate the actors even if they were reasonable. I don't understand how on earth James Brooks finalised this film and it even won him Oscars. I just feel like wasting 2 hours 10 minutes of my life to watch this nonsense emotions. If I will ever make a list of Most Overrated Films that won Oscars then Terms Of Endearment might just top the list.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",Terms of Endearment
36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Some of the most thorough, multi-dimensional characters in a tough but honest story",9,15 August 2011,"Somehow, James L. Brooks manages to bring movies closer to the brink of reality than any other filmmaker without creating a total snooze fest on screen. ""Terms of Endearment"" tells a story of a mother-daughter relationship in strictly chronological fashion, but instead of a traditional plot arc, the plot ascends gradually up toward a conclusion with little spikes for memorable events along the way. What would surely be a pitfall for other writers and directors, Brooks maneuvers around deftly, drawing moving performances from his cast and painting complete and honest portraits of the main characters.The non-traditional plot structure gives ""Terms of Endearment"" a different sort of energy, one that relies less on a forward momentum and more on dissecting characters and relationships. Brooks lures us into drawing conclusions about the characters and then almost always proves us wrong. Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) comes out of the gate as an overbearing mother who manufactured a particular kind of relationship with her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger). Although she's hardly a wonderful woman, as the film progresses her other layers develop and suddenly we're looking at one of film's most impressively sculpted and dynamic characters, not the embodiment of the domineering matriarch as once expected. Equal credit belongs to MacLaine for selling it of course, which makes her Oscar win oh so worthy.Winger certainly deserves half that Oscar as was the sentiment of most at the 1984 Oscars. MacLaine's role has more sizzle, but the story mainly belongs to Emma. As a young woman who's always been emotionally responsible for her mother instead of the other way around, Emma has to be a bit psychologically imbalanced and Winger reflects that in her portrayal. She's sexually self-assured and fiercely self-sufficient, especially when it comes to taking care of her three children that pop up throughout the film's duration, but the negative impact shows in her relationship with her husband Flap (Jeff Daniels). She's prone to fits of jealous rage when she feels as if she's not the center of his universe.Both main characters find themselves in challenging situations with regards to love that make up a bulk of the conflict until things take a decidedly tough turn in the third act. Emma's doubts about her husbands fidelity lead her to stray from her marriage with a loan officer named Sam (John Lithgow). Her mother, on the other hand, has shut out men sexually for decades despite spurring their advances for want of attention, but she's intrigued by Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), the astronaut who lives next door and prefers younger women. Their unlikely relationship provides the comedy of the film, but it evolves into something meaningful by the end. Nicholson gives the type of performance he would later become famous for, but the novelty of it here understandably won him the Oscar.""Terms of Endearment"" can't be called typical or easy; it hits you in the gut with an emotional reality check, one that's unannounced and maybe even unfair to the viewer. Rather than preach its outlook on life or take up other methods to soften the blow, it asks you embrace it without questions. Life can be (and often is) bad, maybe really bad, but there's a lot of good too; whether we accept it or not, hope floats.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Terms of Endearment
37,jzappa,One of Those Few Masterpieces of Merging Broad Comedy and High Tragedy,10,5 May 2011,"When families gather to recall their times together, the banter has a manner of transitioning effortlessly from the heartbreaks to the anecdotes. You'll talk about someone who passed away, and there'll be a second of quiet, and then somebody call to mind some silly thing that happened. Life constantly has a tragic conclusion, but you can enjoy yourself a great deal en route, and everything doesn't have to be drenched in profound meaning. One of the most outstanding accomplishments of Terms of Endearment, which is awash with them, is its knack for striking the equilibrium between the hilarious and the heartbreaking, between moments of multi-layered honesty and other moments of extreme absurdity. What follows in the story is supposed to happen. because life's like that. Since Terms of Endearment knows and loves its characters, we never have a second's misgiving.James L. Brooks' quintessentially bittersweet estrogen shot feels as much like life as any movie after the death of the New Hollywood era. At one fell swoop, it's a showbiz feat, with its high comic flair, its skill with bittersweet dramaturgy and its star turns for the cast. Possibly the best thing about this movie is the way it merges those two tonal styles of filmmaking, the purity of which has been sullied by the cloying, lugubrious manipulation of films like Jack or Patch Adams. This is a movie with hard emotional scenes and immense laughs, and together it's so resolutely at home in its pitch that we believe we're seeing real people.The movie's about two women and their relationships with one another and with the men in their lives. Moms are more prone than dads to support relationship development in their kids. Moms are more prone than dads to respond to their children's input in conversation. The way moms talk with their kids is better fit to encourage smaller children in their attempts to comprehend verbal communication than dads. It seems like James L. Brooks might've known this. The mother is played by Shirley MacLaine. She's a Houston widow who hasn't courted a man since her husband's death. Perhaps she's conveyed her sexual needs into the garden, which has grown so generously proportioned and detailed that she either will have to find a mate without delay or move to a house with a bigger yard.Her daughter, played by Debra Winger, marries a guy named Flap who teaches English in a succession of Midwestern colleges. She raises three kids and stomachs Flap, whose eye roves like a full-size SUV. Back in Houston, her mother at last goes out on a date with the swinging bachelor who has lived next door for years. He's an overindulgent ex-astronaut with a grin that hints at unutterable lust. MacLaine, a lady who envelops herself with superfluities and flowers, is shocked by this feral man and then affected by him.There are a couple of other bittersweet relationships in the film. Both mother and daughter have shy, good-natured male admirers: MacLaine is pursued everywhere by Vernon, who asks just to be allowed to stare at her, and Winger has a gentle little affair with a banker. The years elapse. Children mature into puberty, Flap gets a job as department head in Nebraska, the astronaut turns out to have real human potential of becoming somewhat sensitive, and mother and daughter develop into a more welcoming and multifaceted bond. All of this is told in a succession of seamlessly written, acted and directed scenes that stream as naturally as a great day in a full life, and then something occurs that is completely unforeseen, and alters everything. Yet it pours out of everything that comes before it so sincerely.This is a superb film. I'm excited by the self-determination it affords itself to shift from the audacious clowning of Nicholson's highlights to the performance of Winger in the closing scenes. She surpasses herself. It's a faultless performance. And yet it's not a ""performance."" There are scenes that have such a relaxed goodness that acting feels as if to have little to do with them. She doesn't grasp for indications, and neither does the film, because it's as it should be just the way it is.",Terms of Endearment
38,jamesrupert2014,Well-acted dramedy,7,20 June 2018,"The film follows Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine), controlling, sometimes abrasive, mother to daughter Emma (Deborah Winger), as the two deal with Emma's deteriorating marriage (of which Aurora disapproves) to ineffectual and unfaithful husband Flap (Jeff Daniels) and Aurora's own relationship with her libidinous, bon-vivant neighbour, ex-astronaut Garret Breedlove (Jack Nicolson). The 'comedy' primarily comes from Aurora's reaction to Garret's ribald, teasing demeanor (and later bold courting style) and her constant belittling of Flap; the drama from the sudden, tragic turn the story takes in the 'third act'. This is a purely character-driven movie, so if you really dislike Aurora, Garret, Emma, or Flap (and they give you a variety of reasons to do so), you will probably dislike the movie. The film racked up the Oscars (winning five of 11 nominations, including four of the 'top five' awards). MacLaine and Nicolson are very good although you can tell that Nicolson's role was written for him (the character is not in Larry McMurtry's book), he plays the same sly, roguish character that made him a star. The critics (and the Academy) loved the film, but I don't find that star-driven 'relationship' films like ""Terms of Endearment"" age very well - I may have liked the film more if I had watched it when it was released and not 35 years afterwards.",Terms of Endearment

It was praised by critics and swept the major awards, winning five academy awards, including best picture. It stars Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, Jeff Daniels, and John Lithgow. I absolutely loved the casting, every actor represented their character so well. MacLaine turns in a performance of a lifetime, she is funny and witty at times, then sharp as a tack and tough as nails in other moments. And Winger is so skilled and charming in her role, she plays Emma with a certain lovable innocence. I love how these two talented actresses commanded the screen, and had amazing chemistry together while doing it. Another Hollywood heavyweight that turns in a great performance here is Jack Nicholson, I really loved him playing Garrett, he brings something to the role that only he could do, it's something about Nicholson that is just perfect for this character. And he and Auroras connection in the film is really something fantastic, it was great to see an older mid life romance between two people with such chemistry. The writing is superb, the writing really focuses mainly on Emma and Auroras relationship, their connection as mother and daughter, but it also brings in subplots that Nicholson and Daniels. I love how the script includes all those different very important aspects of the movie, and it brings them all together to form a near perfect film. This a classic film that I recommend, but I warn that you may need a few tissues. 9/10 for Terms of Endearment.",Terms of Endearment

Brooks, director and screenwriter here. Not all the characters are likable - few are - but all are well portrayed. Both Shirley Mclaine and Jack Nicholson give good performances, while Debra Winger is excellent in her role as Ms. Mclaine's daughter. Danny De Vito, Jeff Daniels and John Lithgow are also very good in supporting roles.The drama, which makes this film the winner it is, is very well balanced with the humour throughout.

46,MarieGabrielle,Saw this with my Dad....A must see even if you do not like emotional films....,9,14 November 2006,"I am saying that with a sense of humor, because my father (a stoic person) adamantly would not go to a theater to see any films that sounded emotional, but because Nicholson was in it, I persuaded him!.Nicholson really is the foil in this serious and comic drama. It is realistic because nothing is sugar-coated. Think of other films offered up to the public that year. ""Mr. Mom""; (disingenuous, and insulting to the audience). ""Money Pit"". Need I go on?.A decent film does not insult its audience. A good film makes them think. A masterpiece; well...those are few and far between. This film is almost brilliant, because it depicts tragedy, and the way that the characters must move on (albeit how imperfectly). Jeff Daniels as the philandering son in law; Shirley Maclaine as the dominant yet loving mother; Debra Winger as the struggling and too loving mom, married to a ""n'er do well""; but loves her children.It is a serious theme, hence explaining the need for Nicholson. Granted, at this point in time we have seen him as the cynic way too many times, but at the time of this film his interactions with MacLaine were fresh, comic, and realistic.The awkward scenes between Debra Winger and John Lithgow engage the audience; two people alienated and trying to connect, having an affair in Nebraska. The scenes where Daniels moves the family to several different towns are classic; the kids are engaging and effective. In fact this is the ONLY film I can think of where a director has humanly portrayed children as complex and interesting, rather than irritating and noisome.Maclaine is at times overbearing, but understandably so. She is also the matriarch. Danny DeVito is also available for comic relief, as several wealthy widowers pursue Maclaine. This story was written by Larry McMurty (""Lonesome Dove"", ""Evening Star""). I highly recommend it; if you have a family audience it is a great conversation piece. My Dad and I have two generations between us; and he is the greatest critic, not easily impressed, and he remembers the great films of the 40's. This is the one film which will meet, and exceed your expectations. 9/10.",Terms of Endearment

49,onepotato2,Quite good,7,6 March 2008,"This movie chronicles the long, difficult relationship between a Texas widow and her upstart daughter. It's a great movie despite being a little small-scaled for current audiences, overstimulated as they are by surface activity. The characterizations, the casting, and the mix of comedy and sentiment are astonishing. Although the movie is considered a 'weepie,' it has rousing, satisfying, uproarious ideas about how to make a movie of any kind, and serves viewers a vivid slice of life ...while introducing them to American regionalism ...while humming along to a standout score from the 80s. This production thankfully asks viewers to consider complex things and flawed people. Any number of things are very well done here.'Terms' won the Best Picture Oscar back when it was released, by toppling a dull formula, which was to strenuously avoid any hint of humor if you were making a serious drama. It remains great; due to the convincing arcs characters go through, for studiously avoiding the ""right"" way to do things or delivering standard emotions, for dealing candidly with sex, for showing lives and homes that are recognizable, but mostly for its unique, bracing blend of humor and tragedy. Tough guys like to reject this as a chick flick. But every film that presents a female story is not a chick flick. To be sure, there are horrible chick flicks out there. This isn't one of them. If you resent being asked to ponder anything that might make you cry.... if you only want to be shown polite, likable people... if you cannot handle loose ends, or unpunished human failings, you're not ready for this. McClaine, Winger and Nicholson all turn in amazing, skillful work. It also features at least one remarkable children's performance.",Terms of Endearment
50,Movie-ManDan,The Worst Movie To Ever Win The Majors Oscars.,1,27 October 2015,"Crash, The English Patient, and Dances With Wolves are generally regarded as some of the worst movies to win the Oscar for Best Picture. At least those movies were good. The Right Stuff, Scarface, Return of the Jedi, and The Outsiders were so much better than this! I tried watching Terms of Endearment twice and I could barely handle it. My hopes were not high when I watched this. I didn't even know how many awards it won until recent. I didn't even make it past the first hour the first time and felt like I should've gotten a medal for sitting through the full 131 minutes the second time.Terms of Endearment uncovers three decades (which the movie certainly doesn't show well) of a mother and daughter, played by MacLaine and Winger. Each want romance and happiness. Winger marries Jeff Daniels who becomes a college professor and they have some kids together. MacLaine falls for goofy astronaut played by Nicholson. There's really nothing more to it. A movie that documents these many years of somebodies' lives should give us a general sense of who these people are. What do they do? What are their personalities? What do they do in their spare time? What are their ambitions? And none of these general questions are ever answered for any of the characters! Well, I shouldn't say ""ever."" The only things I find out about any of the characters are that Winger and Daniels like to cheat. She cheats with John Lithgow yet is furious when she find out her husband is trying to get out of the same predicament. Karma's a &$?!!If found it really shocking how underdeveloped the whole movie was and I took a great amount of pity on the writers who created completely blank and careless characters with no plot at all.

This is one of those scenes, led by Shirley MacLaine's powerful and immortal performance, that have gone down in history as one of the most gripping moments in dramatic films. With heavy nods to DARK VICTORY and LOVE STORY, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is right at the top of the list of ""women's pictures"" and is, alongside STEEL MAGNOLIAS (also featuring MacLaine) one of those rare beasts of manipulative beauty that brings out all the stops but never does so overtly. It was a huge winner at the 1983 Oscars giving MacLaine her first ever award for Best Actress, and is a film that goes well above awards, filled with beautiful performances by its entire cast, great moments, solid entertainment and a overwhelming, classic finale filled with tears.",Terms of Endearment
52,eric262003,Good Call For The Oscars,9,6 May 2013,".The year 1983 was quite a great year for movies. Many great classics came out that year. But the two that stood out the most in that year was the classic Philip Kaufman film called ""The Right Stuff"" and the always emotionally charged classic ""Terms of Endearment"". Even though I was still a little boy boy at the time this movie was released I had high hopes that ""The Right Stuff"" was going to capture the Oscar that year and I was taken aback by the Academy Awards that ""Terms of Endearment"" actually won the coveted prize. I was really appalled by the judgement and I cursed at the Academy as being biased and only adulate at certain films and neglect those that really deserved the win.Now that I'm an old man at 36 years old, I watched the movie again and I can see exactly why this movie deserved such high-honoured prestige. Something I couldn't decipher in my childhood. After much viewing, in spite of the overdone melodrama and thank mostly to the brilliant script and direction from James L. Brooks, and his gifted cast, ""Terms of Endearment"" stands on its own as a family oriented drama that rises from what the viewers expect this movie to be as it stretches beyond what its intentions are.The story extends through decades, following the complex relationship between a mother and her adult daughter. Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) is an obstinate woman, whose cynical wit and cautious observations are at times too much too handle for her laid-backed daughter Emma Greenway (Debra Winger). Emma takes her liberated views by going off to marry a young man named Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), much to Aurora's dismay. Aurora think that her marrying Flap is the ultimate liability for her. Sure like in all marriages, they are not without their trials and tribulations, but still Emma continues her loyalty to Flap, due the fact that they have three children together. In Aurora's case she has had her share of men in the past including her infatuation over a former astronaut and neighbour named Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who is also at the same a philanderer. And though they have lived contrasting lives, their bondage has remained in sync and before long, their bonding progresses even stronger than it ever has in their lives.Sure this looks on paper as a depressing, melancholy tear-fest that you would likely see on ""The Woman's Channel"" or ""The Hallmark Channel"", but it's really more than just that. It has all the tools to be featured on those channels with issues like tragedy, conflict, and just rooting for the protagonist to win over any obstacles that are getting in their way.The film itself goes beyond the barriers of the standard mother-daughter fare. Aurora does not always comes across as a very likable character. She's aloof towards anyone she comes across and she's quite self-centred in nature. At a dinner scene, she was flabbergasted when Emma and Flap announced they were having a baby. Instead of pleased to this joyous occasion, she exhibits utter anger that know she's the right age to be a grandmother. But still MacLaine does everything possible to make sure Aurora never falls victim to becoming a one-dimensional crab-cake. Her phone discussions with Emma shows that she deep inside cares about her daughter and truly protects her welfare and her well-being.In the case of Emma, Winger just can't seem to change her ways around her character as she continually goes against her mother's wishes and at the same time hungers for her mom's acceptance to whatever decisions she wishes to fulfil. Although there felt at time the old vulnerable daughter marrying an unfaithful husband, we end up seeing a very steady woman who has tripped over a few hurdles in her life and because of that, she discovers that she can stand on her own feet. for that reason alone I think Aurora and Emma are both able to defy any cliché within their characters.Overall this movie still isn't up there with ""The Right Stuff"", but now after multiple viewing, I can now see why the Oscars selected ""Terms of Endearment"" the winner for Best Picture. Good call Oscars.",Terms of Endearment
53,Sergeant_Tibbs,Astounding acting but the jumpy structure cuts through the power.,7,28 August 2014,"Although a film with a loyal teary-eyed fanbase, Terms of Endearment is a Best Picture winner that gets shafted by many as mere TV melodrama. Sure, it's no Lawrence of Arabia, but it's significantly better than people give it credit for. James L. Brooks has a knack for what people like, or at least he did in the 70s and 80s, with this film being partly if tenuously responsible for the birth of The Simpsons, and his confident direction in this domestic comfort zone brings out the best in his actors. The cast may be heightened and overly measured, but they're deeply involved and passionate and it lifts the film off the screen.Each actor, from Shirley MacLaine to Debra Winger, Jeff Daniels to John Lithgow, bare their hearts and soul and it truly shows. Yet at the best of times it seems effortless and deeply human and they all have electrifying chemistry. I really struggle to choose whether MacLaine or Winger was the highlight but they both held the film on their shoulders magnificently. The only weak cog is the bizarrely Oscar winning Jack Nicholson, who isn't necessarily bad but doesn't have enough to do beyond his usual endearing schtick to warrant such acclaim. However, the biggest problem is the structure. The first hour is almost like short vignettes throughout the character's lives without enough flow between them. It just needed a touch more guidance. But instead it darts across their lives, jumping through years and simply losing us completely from investing in the moment. It feels too inconsequential. And subsequently it takes too long to get to its core and give us reasons to invest in these otherwise unremarkable, if engaging, people. Once it gets into the flow of the telephone relationship between Emma and Aurora it becomes much neater, if overzealous with how quickly it wants to jump to the next scene.Fortunately its production is strong, outside of the odd sound Oscar nomination because they mumbled too much, making the environments feel cinematic. If only I connected to it a bit more and found it more funny and emotional then I could look past its misgivings. Instead, it's simply amusing and moving, to use less enthusiastic adjectives. Maybe I should've watched it with my mother. Terms of Endearment is a surprisingly satisfying experience, worth more salt than it's been given post-ceremony, but Brooks bettered it with Broadcast News, if still with pacing issues.7/10",Terms of Endearment
54,jaredmobarak,Medium esteemTerms of Endearment,7,10 January 2008,"I'm not quite sure what I think about James L. Brooks' Terms of Endearment. Here is a film that won best picture at the 1984 Oscars, beating out a favorite of mine, The Big Chill. Everyone I talk to says they love it and here I am feeling a tad lukewarm on the whole spectacle. At first glance, I can't really comprehend what I saw exactly. Truthfully, the whole thing seems as though it was a device to get us to the end, the one sequence of time that has relevant meaning. By the conclusion, not much really happened, a young couple get married and have three children, infidelity ensues, the woman's mother hits mid-life and her usual cold self thaws into the arms of an astronaut, the family falls apart and gets put back together over and over againwhat's new? However, the more I think that what we have is the Usual Suspects syndromea decent film blessed with a resonant finalethe more I think about how genuine and realistic every moment was. Yes, it all means nothing without the end, but then I guess that can be said for most things. All the relationships evolve and grow in ways that are obvious and others that come straight from left field. One can't fault any step taken because without the hour and a half exposition the payoff would not mean even close to what it actually does.The acting is across the board phenomenal, no question. From the screen veterans to a surprising early turn, (possibly his first non-TV credit), by Jeff Daniels, everyone plays flawlessly. Even Debra Winger, as the glue holding everything together throughout all the hard times, who grated on me early on with her annoying Texas country-bumpkin attitude, comes out as a truly profound performance. Her naïveté and her kindness are what make her who she is. That ability to see the good in everyone and the realization of her place as a mother to her children, similar to that which her own mother had with her, but not quite, is the only reason the wheels didn't fall off much earlier. When you see the vain lifestyle her best friend has started living, coming home as though she is still the country girl she used to be, you begin to understand the honesty for which Emma Greenway Horton has always lived for. Sure she never discloses her infidelity to her husband, but besides that she never was anything but true to herself and those around her. Even the messed up marriage at the end was acceptable because their love for their children and each other was too much to allow the fact they were no longer a couple to ruin any of what was between them. If nothing else, this film shows us a glimpse into values, while not perfect, that one just doesn't see much of anymore. Family is always first; their wellbeing over your own as evidenced with Daniels' tough decision at the end.I was with the whole Winger/Daniels story thread if for nothing else but because I knew it was the central backbone to the whole. Besides a nice turn from John Lithgow, nothing else really stood out above the idea of getting a history of them across. What stuck with me most was the relationship between the matriarch of the Greenway family, played larger than life by Shirley MacLaine, and the astronaut next-door Jack Nicholson. These two have sparks flying from the first moment they share the screen. When she goes over and accepts his lunch invitation from a decade earlier, Nicholson's reaction is worth the price of admission alone. The treat of that lunch date, complete with his curtsy comment at its finish, is just gravy on top. His character coming backwho really did think he'd be a good guy?just helps to complete that arc and allow the ending to stand on its own without any outside questioning of people not present. Allowing MacLaine full dedication to her daughter's illness is the best thing that could have been done. That connection is what makes the film work despite its shortcomings.Even though the fact that the conclusion is a total contrivance utilized to get everyone together to ""come to terms"" with each other, it still works on a raw emotional level for me that I am able to look beyond the blatant attempt by the filmmakers to tell me how I should feel. It is moments like the son and Nicholson in the final scene, as well as the likable, glorified adulterer Lithgow, that gave me the satisfaction necessary to accept all the fluff on the edges. You cannot argue that each bond is one that can be related to on some level. At times you believe this family is real and you are just catching a glimpse of their lives as in a documentary, that is how honest their portrayals are. Dysfunction is an understatement, but nothing happens that I couldn't shake my head to and understand exactly where they were coming from. At the end, it was an enjoyable experience on a pure storytelling level. Maybe a tad juvenile and completely structured for full emotional heartbreak, it held enough realism so that the craft didn't overpower it completely. The end is definitely heartbreaking and while Hollywood in the way everything works out, I have to give all involved credit for allowing the relationship between Winger and her eldest son to play out as it did. Setup from the absolute start, from his putting his coat on at age five to leave the house while his parents made love upstairs, to the poignant farewell, that bond is what will stay with me for days to come.",Terms of Endearment
55,TOMASBBloodhound,Sappy soap.,5,12 February 2011,"This is one of those films not made for me, yet since it appears on my television now and then, I feel compelled to comment on it. Terms of Endearment is basically a big, glossy soap opera with a strong cast and clichéd script. This production doesn't disguise the fact that it is exactly that. The central character is an overbearing and domineering matriarch played by Shirley McLaine, and the story deals with her daughter's problems and her own awkward relationship with the astronaut next door. Yep, you heard that right. Jack Nicholson plays an astronaut living next door in her Houston neighborhood. His name.... (please hold your laughter) Garret Breedlove! What a name! What a guy! Of course he is this womanizing loner when he isn't out in space. Do you think he and Shirley will be able to find common ground?? It really doesn't matter since the more interesting parts deal with the daughter (Debra Winger) and her disastrous marriage to a conniving English professor (Jeff Daniels). The marriage is a joke from the start, and things only get worse for Winger as she later develops a Hollywood-type cancer later that we learn little about. All we know is that the ladies in the audience better get their tissues ready. There seems no way for her to be cured. At least she gets to see New York for a few days before the cancer finishes her off.Not a lot more to say about it. This was originally based on a novel by Larry McMurtry, but there likely isn't a lot of his original ideas left in this script. Apparently the Nicholson character wasn't even in his book! Could it be that an astronaut was added to sponge off the popularity of The Right Stuff which also came out that year and was also nominated for an Oscar?? Hmmmm. Anyway, the acting is generally good. Nicholson adds testosterone to the estrogen-rich script, even though his character seems contrived. Jeff Daniels plays a paper scarecrow character, but he does what he can with it. Winger is pretty good. McLaine is over-the-top and maybe thats what won her the Oscar. She's the type of person in real life that you could maybe stand to be around for oh... five minutes at a time. Look for John Lithgow and Danny Devito in small and amusing cameos. Some of this was filmed around my old college in Lincoln, so that's interesting enough. The scene where Winger confronts Daniels while he's talking to a mistress with their baby strapped to his chest was filmed right in the middle of campus. Winger was also romantically involved with our governor Bob Kerrey at the time. Other than these little trivial facts, there isn't a lot more of interest here. At least this film cleaned up at Oscar time, so the people involved can be proud of that. Tender Mercies would seem a more deserving best picture, though. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Terms of Endearment

This film follows the complicated relationship between an icy, Texan widow named Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine)and her slightly-off-the-wall daughter, Emma (Debra Winger), who at the beginning of the film is marrying a man named Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), whom her mother clearly hates, seemingly just to get away from her. The film follows Emma's marriage through three children, infidelity, and unexpected tragedy but it never lets go of the unspoken bond between Aurora and Emma...a bond so strong that it transcends telephone lines, geography, and even dialogue at times...there are moments in the story where you see Aurora and Emma communicate without saying a word to each other. Writer-director James L. Brooks won a pair of Oscars for writing and directing this funny and heartbreaking story that stretches over a long period of time but never fails to hold interest and trust me, the last 20-30 minutes of this film will have you weeping. Shirley MacLaine finally won her long-overdue Best Actress Oscar for her controlled performance as Aurora and Jack Nicholson won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as a retired astronaut who moves in next door to Aurora after Emma moves out and begins a hilarious and touching relationship with Aurora.

63,sashank_kini-1,What's Cancer Got to Do With It?,7,30 January 2012,"Terms of Endearment is a lovely title for a film concerning the relationship not only between a mother and daughter, but also all the surrounding relationships which build up the key relationship. Aurora (MacLaine) is a controlling, finicky and over-protective mother who, after her husband's death, raises her daughter to be like her mother. However, Emma (Winger) is not what Aurora conditions her to be, as she becomes a more open, carefree girl who dresses and snorts like a tomboy and falls in love with a bum. Aurora, in one of the scenes, rebukes her for marrying such a man, and Emma suggests that she not come for her marriage. When Aurora, like a typical mother, acts as though she is hurt by her daughter's reply, Aurora cheekily tells her friend 'Oh, my own mother is not coming to the wedding"" like that makes her wedding unique. Flap (Daniels) is a teacher who lives in a shabby house where second-hand books replace furniture, a stark contrast to Aurora's own neat-and-clean bungalow with a large backyard embellished with flowers of multiple colors. Aurora can't bear Flap's flippant attitude and unrefined appearance and manners – she seethes inwardly when Flap takes a bite out of her meticulously prepared and decorated fish using his hands like a bumpkin. She feels insulted and livid by Flap's humorous remark to her reaction to Emma's pregnancy. Aurora is a difficult woman to like – like a cat she purrs around two men who are head over heels infatuated with her but does not let them bite her. Only a big bad prowling wolf like Nicholson can really seize her. Emma becomes a simple housewife who worries about her husband and children and the increasing financial tensions. When she leaves Texas, Emma maintains contact with her mother through the phone and both exchange talks about their lives. Emma falls for another guy but is still possessive about Flap while Aurora's heart is conquered by Garrett (Nicholson). Flap himself begins a secret affair with a student named Janice. In all this, the dreaded cancer strikes Emma and then all the attention diverts to this matter.I do not favor such an ending, because I feel it lacks a proper resolution and goes for cheap tricks instead. The cancer subject was treated better than many other films – the ten-fifteen minute cancer trauma in 'Love Story' was shabby and the 'Oh Hi Cancer!"" in 'The Room' was spectacularly bad. Terms of Endearment at least treats the cancer matter more seriously, but then there is a feeling of dissatisfaction of not getting to see a more fulfilling ending of all relationships. Some characters are trimmed off in the end and some unnecessary albeit well acted scenes between the four prime characters take place. In 2008s Revolutionary Road, Kate Winslet's character had deliberated about abortion in the beginning but then quickly dismisses the idea. But as circumstances turn for the worse and she cares less and less about the baby, Kate is driven to abort the baby illegally. I prefer such endings where some thread left loose in the beginning is brought back in the ending. Of course, Terms of Endearment would not need such a disturbing ending, but what if Emma had admitted about her affair to Flap? Or Tommy refused to live with Emma? Don't blame the director here though; it has to be loyal to the book. Otherwise, the movie has fine acting moments. Shirley MacLaine channels Aurora with the perfect aura – when she is in bed with Garrett and he is telling her about his space journey, she blushes and smiles and starts resembling her daughter. Sometimes Emma, played beautifully by Winger, begins to sound like her mother. Both the characters may be different in their thinking, but the actresses try to bring out certain traits that are similar between mother and daughter, for example their over-the-top nature. Nicholson is d the right man for the right job while Daniels is acceptable even though he does not lend individuality to his character. Lithgow was good in his parts, though his character went missing after the cancer tale. The actor playing Tommy too was fine – at the age of 10-12, many kids have this brashness and aloofness that Tommy had. I can cite the example of my ten year old cousin who really tries to act too mature and leave-me-alone type at times. Plus it is difficult for a ten year old kid to actually understand the feeling of loss – I was nine when my aunt passed away, but I could not really grasp that loss because I was too young.MacLaine deserved the Oscar, the tiny additions to her character like the constant movement of her fingers or the naturally expressive eyes are lovely to watch. Debra is equally great if not better, but yes, MacLaine was Wow! If only the cancer thing had not happened.My Rating: 7/10",Terms of Endearment
64,oOoBarracuda,"""Does this mean you won't be knitting the baby any booties?""",6,17 February 2016,"This was another film that I really hadn't heard too much about before this year's Oscar month. Even the big name stars of Jack Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Danny DeVito, and Jeff Daniels; this movie flew well below my radar. Terms of Endearment, directed by James L. Brooks, won Oscar's top prize for 1983. Although it was an enjoyable film, I am perplexed at its Best Picture win, and will undoubtedly never see it again.Terms of Endearment shows one very unique mother/daughter relationship. Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) has an overly close relationship with her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) and seeks to control every aspect of her life. Accepting this as ""just the way her mother is"" Emma goes along with her overbearing mother's wishes, until it comes to her marriage. Aurora does not want Emma to marry her boyfriend, Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) and refuses to give her daughter a wedding gift, or even attend the wedding. Aurora believed the union was ill-fated and tried to dissuade Emma from the marriage. The marriage eventually bears Emma three children and a move across states, which does not sit well with Aurora's need to control her daughter. The film then follows several years of the women's lives, through childbirth, heartache, and Aurora's dating life. Against her better judgement, Aurora begins a relationship with her philandering neighbor, retired astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). Aurora is used to being pampered and worshiped, and Garrett refuses to do either of those things. The story of two women traversing life miles apart, yet never losing their connected spirits Terms of Endearment is one to definitely watch only when tissues are close by.The acting in Terms of Endearment was divine. Each character was incredibly quirky and full of nuances, and each actor delivered on those nuances with ease and believability. Incredible acting, that deserves to be noted, but in a not so incredible film. The story has been told before, and better if you ask me; Splendor in the Grass, I'm looking at you. I remain perplexed as to how this film managed to pull off Best Picture; I can only think that it must have been a slow film year. This film tugs at your heartstrings, just for the sake of doing so, it seems. I also found Terms of Endearment a bit weepy and melodramatic. Nothing should be taken away from the acting, that can't be said enough; Shirley Maclaine and Jack Nicholson definitely deserve their statuettes. I suppose I would recommend this film to anyone who likes something along that vein, fans of Jack Nicholson's will leave the movie pleased. Mental note: watch all the other 1983 nominated film and see where Terms of Endearment stacks up, comparatively.",Terms of Endearment

"" - Garret Breedlove (Jack Nicholson)",8,21 November 2005,"#1 Film of 1983 There are few films that can capture the realism of a sad and dysfunctional family, and 'Terms of Endearment' is one of them. It's an extremely funny, extremely heartbreaking and an extremely emotional film that rings true around every corner. James L. Brooks does an impressive job directing and writing this incredible motion picture. There is so much to love about 'Terms of Endearment'. Before renting it I just simply panned it off as being a ""mindless and typical chick-flick"" that had no right to win Best Picture, but after seeing it (the only film I actually cried at the end of) I realized how untypical, intelligent and dare I say brilliant the film actually was. The ensemble cast doesn't have a weak performance in it. Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger give the performances of their career (in my opinion) as the conflicted mother and spiteful daughter. Jack Nicholson is absolutely hysterical in a scene-stealing performance that damn well earned him the Academy Award in the 1984 Oscar ceremonies (as did MacLaine, who beat out Winger for the Best Actress statuette). Rounding out the cast are television clown turned Broadway star John Lithgow as the owner of a local bank in Nebraska that Winger's character has an affair with, and talented actor who will unfortunately always be remembered as Harry from 'Dumb and Dumber', Jeff Daniels, as Winger's not too impressive husband. 'Terms of Endearment' has a few pacing problems, but it's demanding raw emotional power is impossible to ignore. If you can appreciate excellent film-making, don't mind a few minor pacing problems and don't mind balling your eyes out, be sure to experience 'Terms of Endearment'. Grade: A-",Terms of Endearment

It's about the relationship between a strong hearted mother and her independent daughter and the men in their lives. This movie has the power to make you laugh and cry at totally unexpected moments. Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger give the best performances of their careers as Aurora Greenway (the mother) and Emma Horton (the daughter), respectibly. Jack Nicholson comes in for a great comedic supporting role as MacLaine's next door neighbor who's an over-the-hill former astronaut. John Lithgow, Jeff Daniels, and Danny DeVito are also terrific in the other main performances in the film. ""Terms of Endearment"" won 5 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay (James L. Brooks), and it deserved every one of them. James L Brooks scored a bulls-eye with this film which marked his directorial debut. Since this film, he has made two other brilliant films: ""Broadcast News"" and ""As Good As It Gets"". He sure knows how to direct great material. But ""Terms of Endearment"" is his masterpiece.

68,JakeBrinkman,A cast of selfish characters in an unmemorable film,2,25 November 2019,"If you enjoy watching incredibly self-centered people pursue nothing but their own gratification and never learning any lesson from it, this is the movie for you. This story makes one thing clear: the writer has no idea how to portray personality changes. In the beginning, the young couple seem very normal and selfless. But then it skips forward a few years and suddenly they're entirely self-absorbed. The mom, neighbor, and best friend are all narcissists from the beginning, and the entire cast remains selfish right up to the end. When bad things happen, I don't sympathize with any of them because none of them have ever done anything likable. The only exception is literally the closing seconds before the credits, which is obviously far too late to try and save the film, and it also speaks volumes to the poor writing when events are still happening with zero closure and then credits randomly start rolling.I think there may have been some good performances, but they were hidden behind unlikable characters and shoddy writing. Additionally, the cinematography and music weren't particularly inspired, which means this movie isn't going to leave a lasting impression on anyone.",Terms of Endearment

71,samkan,The #1 Movie I Love to Hate,2,25 March 2008,"After the late 60's, early 70's, when movies began to circulate as news and talk show events, we the public began to believe we were to leave the theater having gotten (or not) the message. Such was for better or worse. Great movies like BONNIE & CLYDE, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and NETWORK were fussed, discussed, etc., and educated and entertained us with varying points of view (if no more through water cooler encounters). I may be naive but was it THEN that it became fun to discuss favorite movies, much like books had so been? SUPPORT: Siskel & Ebert's AT THE MOVIES began to appear on PBS in the late 70's.The blowback was a series of shallow - if mildly clever - movies that either the new industry and/or the media spun to we the public as ""art"". Hence TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, DRIVING MISS DAISY, MOONSTRUCK, and more recently Shakespeare IN LOVE, etc. I suggest that films of this caliber, not necessarily terrible, never won Oscars in the 40's, 50's or 60's.The characters in TOE are inarticulate, impatient and shallow people. TOE might have been good if such were the intended message. The sentiments of the movie are incredibly contrived; e.g., we are told zero of the substance of Flab's affairs though Emma's affair is, of course, justified, authentic, etc. I sum up McClain's Character in one word: shrill. I also dare anyone to create a more unashamed melodramatic ending. After watching this flick I walked out of the cinema in Topeka, KS in 1983 not giving a rat's ass about any of the folk or sentiments I'd just seen. Blame it on me being Roman Catholic but the only events, people, circumstances, etc., worthy of concern in TOE were Flap and Emma's children, to which NO attention was paid.I'm going to sound like a snob now. Here's the substance of the personal comments I heard and still hear when I inquire about TOE: ""It was so good"", ""It was so sad."", ""It was soooo good!"", ""It was sooo moving."", ""It was just like real life."", ""I can't believe she died."", ""You know my sister just died.""

72,roghache,Poignant tearjerker chronicling a mother daughter relationship,7,14 March 2006,"I'm giving this movie a fairly high rating, mainly on the basis of its dramatic closing scene. Frankly, I do not see it as Oscar material for Best Picture (which should have gone to Educating Rita that year). However, it does wonderfully portray the ongoing close relationship between a mother, Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger) who are polar opposites and have their differences at times. I found Emma a sympathetic, though imperfect, character but Aurora mainly irritating. Thank goodness she's not my mother! Debra Winger should have received the Best Actress Oscar, not Shirley MacLaine.There's humor but some of the plot just isn't that great. The relationship between Aurora and her next door neighbor, played by Jack Nicholson (what charisma?) didn't work for me. Also, I found the infidelities of Emma and her husband interesting only to the extent that they emphasized Aurora as the constant, loving (though irritating) adult in her life. Unlike her philandering husband, her mother is the only one Emma could depend upon; I guess that's the whole point.For me, the film is all about Emma's terminal cancer and especially the ending. The lovely Debra Winger gives a fabulous performance throughout the movie and is totally convincing in her final moments. Her love for her own children is particularly moving. Get out the hankies, folks, especially if you have kids yourself. It's the tearjerker to end all tearjerkers. There's nothing sadder than a mother saying goodbye to her child / children, and here we have two of them.",Terms of Endearment
73,h-28658,Builds compelling relationships...,7,10 July 2020,"Builds compelling relationships but feels haphazardly constructed; the majority of the film's focus on love and infidelity feels completely separate from Emma's cancer. Overall Terms of Endearment suffers from a lack of focus, trying to encourage too many facets of its characters without giving sufficient exploration to them, or to a guiding theme.",Terms of Endearment
74,dr_clarke_2,Stand-out performances from MacLaine and Winger in a scintilating comedy-drama,10,8 June 2020,"James L. Brooks' 1983 film Terms of Endearment can be described variously as a comedy, a romance and a drama. In fact, it's a blend of all three, and beautifully combines great characters, sparkling dialogue and superb acting to make an often very funny but bittersweet movie.
Based on the novel by Larry McMurty, Terms of Endearment follows the relationship between Aurora Greenway and her daughter Emma over a period of about thirty years. It opens with Aurora expressing her disapproval of Emma's marriage to college professor Flap Horton, and follows the mother and daughter through their trials and tribulations as they bicker incessantly whilst swapping notes on their lives; Emma and Flap both have affairs, whilst Aurora starts having a relationship with eccentric ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove. This rich blend of characters - which also includes Emma's lover Sam Burns and a group of would-be suitors of Aurora's - makes for a comic brew, and Brooks' screenplay exhibits much of the sort of character-based humour he has been bringing to The Simpsons for years.
Brooks focalises the film through both Aurora and Emma, whose ups and downs parallel each other. The casting is perfect: Shirley MacLaine is perfect as the neurotic, repressed Aurora and gives one of the most convincing performances of her distinguished career, naturalistically portraying a whole range of emotions. She gets some of the funniest moments in the film, as Aurora finds herself facing a charm offensive from Breedlove, who both repels and fascinates her in equal measure. Debra Winger, still early in her film career, is equally impressive as Emma, also giving an entirely believably performance and again getting to portray the full range of human experiences throughout the film. She's astonishingly good during the final quarter of the film, when the story takes a darker turn and Emma is diagnosed with - and dies from - terminal cancer.
Jack Nicholson meanwhile plays one of many larger-than-life characters in his curriculum vitae, but manages to make Garrett both believable and sympathetic in equal measure, as he goes from boorish seducer to somebody more nuanced and thoughtful as both Aurora and the audience get to know him. Likewise, Jeff Daniels impresses as Flap Horton, a deeply flawed but human character. The entire cast is impressive, from John Lithgow's Sam Burns to Danny De Vito's Vernon Dalhart, who tries his luck with Aurora but finds only disappointment.
As a director, James L. Brooks isn't an auteur, but an artisan: the film is supremely well made without drawing attention to the direction, instead focusing on the characterisation and the acting. Everything else is polished but modestly restrained, from Andrzej Bartkowiak's cinematography to Michael Gore's effective but unobtrusive score (itself occasionally used for comic effect, such as when Garrett and Aurora are kissing in the sea). This should not detract from the skill with which scenes such as that of the car on the beach are directed. The passage of time within the film is subtle - there are no intertitles or on-screen dates, just gradual leaps forward through the lives of the characters, and the make-up used to age MacLaine and Winger is so well done it goes virtually unnoticed.
James L. Brook has had an impressive career in both film and television, but he rarely crops up on lists of people's favourite cinema directors. Partly, this is perhaps because of his understated style and partly because he has only directed six films to date, even if at least half of those (including this one) are extremely well regarded. Terms of Endearment was the first and it's a deeply impressive debut.",Terms of Endearment
75,Brian-272,"Great movie that is filled with the ups and downs of family life the emotions, joy, and sadness.",9,19 May 2001,"James L. Brooks really hit a winner with this one. This Oscar winning examination of a mother- daughter (Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger) relationship spanning 30 years is simply a masterpiece. The movie is well written and the performances from Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, and John Lithgow couldn't have been better plus the music played during the movie is wonderful it helps carry the story and emotions of the film along just perfect. In fact Jack and Shirley MacLaine won Oscars for their Terms of Endearment work, hers for Best Actress and his for Best Supporting Actor both were well deserved. Every scene that Jack and Shirley had you could see the greatness. Nicholson was great as Garrett Breedlove a retired pot-bellied, hard-drinking, girl-chasing astronaut who didn't worry about his image and when he settled into the Houston, Texas suburbs he is romantically touched by the neurotic Aurora Greenaway played by Shirley MacLaine, but the bittersweet romance was secondary to the main theme of the up and down but loving mother-daughter relationship (MacLaine and Winger) had it is very common with many mother and daughter relationships to have the over protection and worry and concern filled with lighthearted moments, the Aurora Greenaway character is very high strong but loving and kind she reminds me of my own grandmother you just love a person like that. This movie is punctuated by tragedy it has one of the saddest endings in movie history you can easy cry your eyes out. See this as many times as you want I suggest it each time I view it I see how the movie holds true to the way life and the relationships we have are full of ups and downs and learn to enjoy every minute you have of life because it really goes quick and things happen unexpected.",Terms of Endearment
76,Herag,Tears of Endearment.,7,6 August 2008,"I relish the dialog between the Aurora (Shirley Maclane) and Garret (Jack Nicholson) over the fence. Here are two mature Actors who can show a thing or two about acting to the actors of lesser talent.This movie would have gone on the wayside (I say this since the story is generic tear-jerker,) if not for them, and of course Emma (Debra Winger,) who will be in their league when she gets to their age. The only actor that I feel was not up-to the mark was her husband Flap! who was a flop! when it comes to acting. The scene in the Hospital room apologising to her-another actor would have acted this out more convincingly. This is the First Movie that I have seen by James L. Brooks. He is neither Coppola nor Scorsese but he has certain angle to the film making that is laudable. I am curious to know if the scene at the beach was done with stunt actors? if it was not, I commend Nicholson and Macclane for their courage do this incredible stunt. The movie touches every chord of human relations and every scene is well scripted and acted. But the one whose performance that lingers is that of course Macclane's and she deserved all the awards and accolades.",Terms of Endearment
77,luke-a-mcgowan,"It has its flaws, but to resist this film you'd have to be made of stone",7,26 August 2015,"A movie's opening scenes are often its most telling and important, and so it was with Terms of Endearment. The first few scenes of James L. Brooks' family drama are probably the best in the film. A widow who wants badly for her daughter to need her for comfort accepts her daughter's invitation to share her bed, because the daughter knows who is really in need. The sharing of the bed really establishes the relationships between Emma and her mother Aurora early on, which is vital because that's the focus of the entire movie. For every scene in which Aurora is interfering or disapproving, we can remember the very first scene where Aurora was so desperately protective of her daughter that she would wake her up to ensure she was still alive.Shirley Maclaine is a delight to watch in this movie, especially in the opening and closing moments of the film. An unconscious smile comes over Shirley's face when her daughter fights with the husband she so strongly disapproves of. A man familiarly lays his hand on her and she looks at him with pointed indignation of someone whose been through this far too many times. She is sassy but deeply loving of her daughter Emma, which becomes a core of the movie. Towards the middle of the film, Aurora enters a forgettable and slightly forced romance with the aptly named Garrett Breedlove (Nicholson), which sidelines a lot of Maclaine's talent. Nicholson is a master class actor, but this is definitely not one of the best performances on his resume.Emma, also played unforgettably by Debra Winger, was just as mesmerising as Maclaine. She is utterly charming and shares great chemistry with her husband, mother and children. Winger (along with Jeff Daniels and director James L. Brooks) is so effective that the mere mention of her mother can kill the mood in a moment, which is as authentic as real life can be. Throughout the film, Emma's marriage with Flap falls apart because she suspects he is having an affair, so she jumps along with Sam (a performance that John Lithgow somehow got an Oscar nomination for). This is about where the film lost me, because even when Flap's infidelity is confirmed, I could hardly sympathise or support her because I knew she cheated on him first. However, Lithgow and Winger have one of my favourite scenes in the film - each tries to hold the other's hand and both miss by a few seconds as the other doesn't notice. Its beautifully awkward.Towards the end, Terms of Endearment takes is famous turn for the tissues as Emma is diagnosed with terminal cancer. James L. Brooks is at the top of his game in creating beautiful, affecting moments, fully and ably supported by Winger and Maclaine. Shirley Maclaine wins the Oscar in a single scene where she shrieks for someone to manage her daughter's pain. Winger (and the actors playing her children, especially Huckleberry Fox) delivers one of the saddest movie farewells I have ever seen. You have to be made of stone not to be affected by young Fox's tears as he hugs his mother goodbye.James L. Brooks' script has some great moments of comedy and even more of drama. For example, see where Emma's friend Patsy is trying to get around talking about cancer. Emma directly says to Patsy ""Its OK to talk about the cancer"" and then Brooks cuts to a new friend saying almost verbatim ""so Patsy says you have cancer!"" as if it were a new fishbowl or garage door mechanism. The reaction of Patsy (to spit out her food in shock) completely mirrored my own. Brooks is also masterful at directing such scenes, but throughout the film I couldn't shake the feeling that most of the scenes were strung together without making a cohesive narrative. I also found Patsy's attempt to adopt just Emma's daughter to be a poorly chosen subplot towards the end, especially where Patsy tearfully wishes she could take the little girl away. Not tasteful or effective.But for the most part, Terms of Endearment sets out to tell a beautiful small scale family story, and it does it remarkably well. As I said, you'd have to be made of stone not to be affected by the end.",Terms of Endearment

Constantly.Aurora's contempt for everything her daughter does is so palpable that MacLaine's performance becomes one-note long before she finally gets to scream her lungs out in the hospital where her daughter lays dying.As for their men, both of them are losers in one way or another: Garrett is an egomaniac who can't keep it in his pants.

And in all honesty, that short description covers most of the question, ""what is Terms of Endearment about"". Of course, there is color in the form of the supporting players in the women's lives. Jack Nicholson plays a former astronaut who woos the aging mother, and Jeff Daniels is very good as Winger's husband, a college professor and impatient father. The film lacks narrative drive. It is uncommonly patient, carefully sculpting an authentic, living world around its characters. But that relaxed composure may be its biggest strength. Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry, Terms of Endearment sweeps you away into the lives of these fictional strangers.While there is infidelity, resentment, and other tensions, the characters' relationships and conflicts are never punched up for manipulative effect, but played assiduously and naturally, creating a deeply felt connection between us and them. This is a story we can feel in our bones, because the characters feel like people we know. Even if I don't see myself in Shirley MacLaine's Aurora Greenway, or Debra Winger's Emma Horton, I recognize them as personalities. They could be my mother, my aunt, my grandma. Danny Devito could be my neighbor, Jeff Daniels could be my professor, Troy Bishop could have been my childhood friend, John Lithgow could be someone I said hello to in the hardware store. They feel real. With that accomplished, the emotions are real. From the joys, the laughs, to the heart-shattering lows there is no disconnect between what we are seeing and what we feel. This thing culminates with an emotional thunderbolt. One we see coming, but convince ourselves every step of the way can't possibly come to pass until it inevitably does. In other words, a lot like real life.Terms of Endearment is the rare film that inspires introspection on your own life; on your own family. It puts into perspective how important familial relationships are. To finish this movie and not be inspired to forge a stronger bond with your loved ones is impossible. The grand feat of Terms of Endearment is not that it makes you cry, but that it makes you think about why you cry. Few films have hit me harder.95/100",Terms of Endearment
87,Qanqor,Extremely weak,4,27 August 2006,"OK, I had low expectations when I saw this film; I didn't know much about it, but I had a sense it was going to be a ""chick-flick"". But since I'm determined to see every Best Picture film, I had to see this one. And since I was going to see it, I tried to start with an open mind.Well, it was worse than I expected. I can't quite rate it as ""awful"", because it did have a good cast, and I thought the performances were pretty good. And the story actually had me interested... for a while. My complaint is this: after setting up all these interesting dynamics and tensions between the characters, I was interested to see how it would all resolve. And the resolution? Well, here's the spoiler: the central character gets cancer and dies. That's it. Cheap, trite Hollywood cop-out. That's basically NO resolution. There never really IS any resolution of: 1) the mother and Jack Nicholson, 2) the older son's anger at his mother, 3) Emma's TOTAL (and totally annoying) hypocrisy about infidelity (and notice how, after having given the husband this sanctimonious sermon about how he had to come clean with her, she later TOTALLY dodges coming clean with him. Ultra-hypocrite), 4) The hatred between the mother and the husband. Because everything just gets pushed aside once Cancer comes into the story. By that point, it just becomes heavy-handed and obvious. Feh.",Terms of Endearment

I realized Jack Nicholson won the award for the Best actor in a supporting role and what a performance it was!The movie is an equal mixture of family relationship, love for the dear ones during hard times, sensible humor and attitude that bolsters with age. Aurora and Emma are a real-life-like mother and daughter who share an unbreakable bond despite the petty arguments they often have. Aurora and Emma have ups and downs in their respective families- Aurora divorces her husband and keeps denying Garrett a date with her, while Emma hustles with her husband, performs adultery and threatens her husband's ""colleague"" to end things with him. Emma is diagnosed with cancer and Aurora takes care of her daughter in the last days of her life. While Aurora and Emma portrayed a genuine mother-daughter relationship, Garrett, played by Jack Nicholson entertains you with his sardonic sense of humor. He's a retired astronaut who has hots for his neighbor, Aurora who constantly snubs him. The movie totally deserves the awards that were bestowed upon it.",Terms of Endearment

It took till near the end with him walking out of the hospital with his grandmother till an adult stood up to him for his behavior. Parents NEVER did a thing about it.Danny De Vito & his small part.

90,copperncherrio,Mother Daughter Relationships Meh...,6,13 March 2011,"Overall this movie reminds me of a better version of Steel Magnolia. It pretty much has the same storyline, minus a few of the minor characters, plus a lot of better side story lines. The story is follows a mother a daughter and skips over several years as we see their relationship and life unfold.This movie won 3 Oscars during their year Though I kind of see why, I'm not super thrilled about it. It wasn't life changing and sometimes annoyingly random, which is a bit of a downer. I really didn't like the mother and the daughter was meh. The only thing I really got out of it was that I found the young Jeff Daniels super attractive.I really, really mean I find him super attractive even though he played a bit of a douche husband. But the good thing is that it's not all his fault, the marriage was of mutual destruction.",Terms of Endearment
91,gottogorunning,Great Performances!,9,17 August 2005,"'Terms of Endearment' is a well acted film that handles its subjects pretty good but is too much of a tearjerker in the end. It won several Academy Awards including Best Picture, which it did not deserve. (Better movies from the same year include 'The Right Stuff', 'A Christmas Story' and even 'Return of the Jedi'.) It also won Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson an Academy Award and those were deserved. John Lithgow and Debra Winger were nominated for their parts. This says a lot about the movie. The acting is so good that you are willing to forgive the film its weak points, especially the end.Director James L. Brooks has directed four movies (including 'Broadcast News' and 'As Good As It Gets') and it is the strong acting they all have in common. The fact that he knows how to create a lot of comedy moments in a drama film, or the other way around, is admirable as well. In 'Terms of Endearment' people are not very happy. We have Aurora (MacLaine) who is an obsessive mother who is probably the most unhappy of them all. Her daughter is Emma (Debra Winger) who marries a guy named Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels); Aurora does not like him at all. As the story develops we see how Emma and Flap, who started pretty happy together, become more unhappy with their lives and each other. They move away from Aurora because Flap finds a job in Iowa. Aurora slowly lightens up. The main reason for that is the guy next door named Garrett (Jack Nicholson).Up until this point the film is an interesting look into a family but about here the story starts going wrong. Especially the events around the Winger-character seem to be there to keep the movie going in an interesting way, including an affair with Sam Burns (John Lithgow). The later events seem to be there only to jerk a tear. Fortunately it also provides scenes where MacLaine, Winger, Daniels, Lithgow and of course Nicholson can show how good they can act. Where the story goes wrong the acting only becomes better and better. That alone is a good reason to see this film, although especially the first half is interesting as a story as well. Actually, I think most audiences will not mind the second half. There is a good chance you ill be moved and the movie gets what it wants.",Terms of Endearment

But there is something that resembles its style in a slightly different manner and I really enjoy listening to... maybe the witiness of the dialogue or the inteligent dialogue-packed screenplay?Also, the characters feel somehow different. They aren't morally good or bad as in many recent pictures I've seen. I was wrong when I thought that I could just label half of the story as a toxic relationship and that's all . The truth is, there's a mutual problem here, each character has its own obstacle to surpass and somehow betrays or disappoints or others.The idea is that even if the story drags a bit at some point due to its lenght, the characters are certainly one of the most genuine thing in ""Terms of Endermeant"" and perhaps the no. #1 to watch this movie one day, among the very well-written script and performances.An 8,5 out of 10 from me.",Terms of Endearment
93,eschetic,"A ""Chick Flick"" to give a bad name to the Genre",2,27 June 2007,"Yes, Debra Winger is wonderful. Yes, the almost always underrated (and then recent recruit from the New York stage) Jeff Daniels gives a heartfelt real performance as the unfairly disparaged husband. Yes, perennial film favorite Shirley MacLaine chews scenery in every way imaginable and is matched every step of the way by Jack Nicholson in the first of his ""how far over the top will the director let me go?"" performances . . . but the bottom line is how much tolerance do you have for a film mother-in-law who tells her daughter (Winger) that any husband (Daniels) who becomes the HEAD of the English Department at a major university (or ANY similar job at the top of his profession) is a ""loser"" because the job requires that the couple live in a city other than where the mother is living (and ""catting around"" with Nicholson).Do you believe *anything* that woman is going to say in the rest of the film?A generation or two of husbands and boyfriends have sidled up to their wives and girlfriends (in tears after the manipulative final hospital scene) and said how wonderful the mother-daughter love bond was. But it doesn't take a major cynic to wonder if it wasn't more in the hope of ""getting lucky"" than genuine enjoyment of the film.There's nothing *wrong* with honest manipulation of emotions with idealized mother/daughter ties (OR father/son or even buddy/buddy - I've seen more grown men dissolved in tears after FIELD OF DREAMS or that straight teenage boy ""stroke film"" TOP GUN than I have women after TERMS OF ENDEARMENT), but the underlying relationship really OUGHT to be an admirable, healthy one.

94,Marie-62,Beautiful,9,23 November 2000,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Shirley MacLaine's interpretation of Aurora Greenway is definately one of her finest. Debra Winger is delightful, and Jeff Daniels is fantastic. When Emma (Winger) decides to get married to Flap Horton (Daniels), her mother Aurora (MacLaine) has a fit, basically because of her urge to be a control freak. Later, though, Emma discovers that her husband's been cheating on her, and worst of all, she has terminal cancer. Sad enough? Not yet. Aurora has been having an affair with her next door austronaut, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson) who I REALLY didn't care for at all. The casting was all wrong with Jack Nicholson as the astronaut. Provided that he pulls off the rude and idioticness of the character, he just doesn't look good enough for her. The first time I saw this movie, the moment I saw him with the girls in the car, I knew that they would end up a couple. I prayed that Shirley MacLaine wouldn't be put with him, but it didn't get granted. It sort of, well, ruins their scenes together. Otherwise, the rest of the movie is sad, sometimes funny, and very VERY heart felt. A 9. I took one off because of Jack.",Terms of Endearment
95,lauraeileen894,Overrated and manipulative,1,9 May 2007,"I am a heterosexual, red-blooded woman who hates ""Terms of Endearment"". There, I said it, and I don't care who knows. ""Terms of Endearment"" is one of those insufferable movies aimed for women, even though it is clearly written by men who clearly don't know anything about real women. It's also a disjointed, plot less, excruciatingly dull story with some of the most poorly written characters to ever disgrace the screen.I didn't know which female protagonist I found more insufferable: Aurora (Shirley McClaine), an overbearing mother who clings to her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) like a leach but doesn't appear to actually love her. Aurora is one of those people who refuse to let go and let God, as evidenced where she happily wakes her sleeping baby daughter up because she's convinced that Emma has suffered ""crib death"". Emma is so sick of her mother's nagging ways, she marries the first loser who shows interest, much to her mother's chagrin (""You are not special enough to overcome a bad marriage,"" Aurora bluntly tells her).Then there's Emma herself, who I desperately wanted to root for, having an overprotective mom myself. Emma could have been written with a certain amount of dignity, passion, and endearing insecurities and intelligence that emerge in spite of Aurora's crappy parenting. Instead, Emma is an immature, petulant, flighty ninny who goes from having a backbone of steel one moment to being a complete pushover the next. She firmly calls her ne'er-do-well husband Flap (Jeff Daniels) on his infidelity, and yet stays with the cheating bastard for no clear reason whatsoever. Not to mention Winger plays Emma the way one would a mentally unstable 3-year-old and who sounds she doing the world's worst Joan Cusack impression. I got the feeling her children would be like the type of kids who have to raise and clean up after their alcoholic parents.I knew something was wrong when the only character I even remotely liked was Jack Nicholson's aging womanizer character. Considering that I don't even like Jack Nicholson, that's really something.Worst of all, ""Terms of Endearment"" is responsible for starting the trend of manipulative tearjerkers that involve families coming closer because of death (""Stepmom"", ""The Family Stone"", ""One True Thing""). Not only is it reprehensible to treat death so lightly, but it is unfair to the audience. It's as if filmmakers are punishing them for not being emotionally invested enough in the characters by creating latent feelings of guilt by killing them off. And it's always with Hollywood Cancer, the type of cancer where vomiting and chemotherapy somehow never come into play.I have nothing against chick flicks, I really don't.

97,donuthaters12,Sweet And Humorous,8,18 December 2013,"Terms of Endearment is a film that I had no clue on whether or not it would appeal to me. After seeing it twice I can safely say that for the most part, the film made an impression and it is hard to nitpick on a film that is directed so well that seeing it's flaws did make me feel awful. Objectively, the film does have it's flaws but it's a flaw that I felt that was only raised due to my personal tastes.The film is based on a book by Larry McMurtry and the screenplay was written by James L. Brooks. The film travels through the moments of these characters lives whether they are positive or negative, and the timeline span is quite huge. The film jumps from year to year, which felt spontaneously but that could have resolved if the film spends more time at that moment, but running the risk of feeling to overbloated and long. This does end up making the film feel very episodic and it may not be an approach that would appeal to everyone as some would prefer a flowing experience of these people's lives. Brooks wants us to experience the lives of both Aurora and Emma and not have us be focused on a plot in driving the film forward. This episodic approach does at times do make the film feel draggy and honestly a certain time period could have been a film on it's own if explored long enough. The highlight of the film is the relationship between Aurora and Garrett as the clashing of both personalities just brings out moments of humor and surprisingly at times warmth and happiness.James L. Brooks also directed this film and I must say that he has done a magnificent job. Brooks' direction is the reason that the film doesn't feel like going through the same motions again and again because he doesn't fill the film entirely with one note. There are times where you may feel like you are about to shed a tear and there are moments that would make you laugh, and because the film allows us to look into their lives in a natural and lengthy approach, it doesn't let the moments of humor and melodrama feel forced. There were moments where it might land on heavy sentimental territory but Brooks' balance with humor buffers that tone. This was Brooks' first film and what a great way to start off his directorial career by winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars.The film's director of photography was Aandrzej Bartkowiak and he has worked on some notable films later on like Falling Down and Speed. Terms of Endearment was one of his early films and what he has done for Brooks' film is that he gave the picture a warm tone and has a soft look to it. The film's warm tone definitely a major apparatus in conveying the light heartedness that drives the film and it also allows the film to feel accessible. Brooks and Bartkowiak has opted to use an abundance of close-ups as the film is drama centered and the film primarily focuses on the characters reactions and feelings towards certain things, the expressions on the actor's faces makes this film feel wonderful and most importantly natural.The film's score is composed by Michael Gore and if I had to describe his work for this film in a nutshell, it would be beautiful. The score is driven with this light piano sound and it goes back and forth to being sad and cheerful, which kind of a great representation of life. Michael Gore doesn't seem to be working lately but he has worked on notable films like Fame and, a personal favorite of mine, Pretty In Pink. Gore's work here is definitely a standout and is a central key in having us laugh or cry throughout this film.This film has a stellar cast with almost all of the key players being nominated for their performances. Debra Winger was fantastic who starts off as being young, quirky and adorable to a matured, experienced and endearing person. The evolution of her character is amazing and that I really believed that she went through everything that was shown on screen. Shirley MacLaine won Best Actress for this film and it was well deserved though competing against her co-star was a tough one. MacLaine was able to shine throughout the entire film as she is at her best when she has someone to challenge with in a scene, so all of the moments where she is with Debra Winger or Jack Nicholson, it brought out the best of her. Jack Nicholson is not the focus of this film but he does make quite an impression in this film and I was also surprised he was able to come off as sweet and likable as my experience with his films are usually him playing someone frightening or intimidating. Jeff Daniels was not given the attention he deserved for this film, in my opinion he gave an award winning performance and he was able to come off as likable and sympathetic even after everything he has caused. This film is a type of film that challenges and brings out the capabilities of an actor and each cast member have shown off their most outstanding of performances here in this film.Terms of Endearment is not perfect in my eyes but it gets a lot of things right that it would be horrible decision to pass it up. James L. Brooks' wonderful direction and Michael Gore's score will have you laughing and crying from start to finish, and acting performances that will have you caring for the characters and the troubles and joys that they go through.",Terms of Endearment
98,antcol8,It is television,3,29 August 2019,"I've read so many good reviews here - I mean bad reviews, but well - written bad reviews. So there's not much left to say that hasn't already been said. So I'll just add a couple of things from the perspective of 1983: if you went to see a movie then and said it was ""television"", that was clearly a bad thing. Not like now, where many television shows are more nuanced than most current films. In those days this meant it was a big budget soap opera. Which is what this is: a barely - nuanced big budget soap opera. With stars. Lots of big stars.In the big Times Square theater where we saw this film when it first came out, my ex-wife and I could not help laughing at the cynicism of how much and how hard they pushed the tearjerking at the end of the film. We were both huge fans of Douglas Sirk, and thus we knew how much intelligence and craft could go into this genre of filmmaking. Many members of the audience (some of whom were crying) turned around and glared at us. But what could we do? This movie was ridiculous, and worthy of our scorn. Anyway, we weren't laughing out loud - more like snickering. What we should've done was to have proclaimed, following in the footsteps of Senator Bentsen, ""Bad movie, we knew Imitation of Life - you're no Imitation of Life!"" (Or perhaps, at best, a cheap made - for TV imitation of Imitation of Life - LOL, like they say nowadays). Well, if it's OK to cry at a movie, it should be OK to laugh at one...I guess this is part of a much longer discussion about appropriate public behavior.In any case, thanks once again to TCM for not making me have to waste any more time than is necessary to revisit movies from my youth and see whether my initial impressions were correct or not.

99,Doogie D,wildly overrated,3,7 May 1999,"Every so often I go back and watch this movie again to confirm the awful truth: I just do not respond to it in any way except a mild revulsion. McMurtry, like some contemporary novelists (like, say Anne Tyler), has a bad habit of equating adultery with liberation and adolescent behavior to la dolce vita.  On occasion, the story can still work (THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, or THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, in Tyler's case), but mainly it's just a bunch of characters, desperate and floundering.  (Albert Brooks notes in the far superior BROADCAST NEWS, ""Wouldn't it be nice if neediness and insecurity were sexy?""*)  The characters in this movie are uncommitted and insecure, but not in a way that really lets me in.  And by the time the cancer runs its course, I've felt not even mawkishly manipulated -- that's how uninvolved these characters leave me (and each of these actors have, I think, been just great elsewhere).Boy, I admire James Brooks, and he tends to give us great, smart, witty entertainment.  But not here, I'm afraid.

101,Drewboy-2,What is the proper timeline?,10,12 December 2003,"SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT!!!  I couldn't understand the timeline this movie was supposed to cover.  When the sequel THE EVENING STAR came out, it began in 1988, with Melanie at 18 as a college freshman, putting her birth in 1970.  When Aurora later describes Melanie as being 3 years old when her mother, Emma, passed away, it puts Emma's death in 1973.  However, earlier in the film, Emma is seen driving with her lover in a late 70's Pontiac through the Iowa countryside.  Not only this, but looking at the ages of her sons at the point of Emma's demise indicates they were about 10 and 5 at the time, which would put Emma and Flap's marriage in about 1959 or thereabouts. Why then did Flap have long hair and speak as though it were the late 60's? Why was a mid-60's Chrysler seen in Aurora's driveway before Emma's marriage?  So frankly, I don't understand - am I off by ten years, or was THE EVENING STAR wrong in its timeline all together?  McMurtry's novel puts Aurora's birth in 1913 and Emma's in about 1940, which is in line with the opening shots of Aurora as a young WWII wife with a baby.

The other story about the daughter getting married and starting a life in Texas isnt anywhere near as interesting or engrossing.

The screenplay has been built very well based on the best stuff from the novel. The scenes are very short, well edited, to the point and move the story ahead smoothly and effectively which really makes it a classic.

108,Diego_rjc,"Well acted, but inconsistent, flawed and not that sad",6,18 February 2010,"James L. Brooks made his debut as a director in 1983 directing 'Terms of Endearment'. Until then, he had only wrote a few TV series and produced them, but never worked as a director. He is more well-known as the writer of the episodes of 'The Simpsons', and after this movie he directed only three more movies. But his first one is still considered his best one, winning five Oscars in 1984 and still been highly acclaimed by the critics. That's what I call a debut!'Terms of Endearment is based on the book of the same name by American- writer Larry McMurtry. James L. Brooks adapted the story for the big screen, and also directed and produced it. It tells the story of Aurora and Emma Greenway, mother and daughter. The movie follows several years in both lives, showing the people around them, their loves, their lovers, their illusions, their disillusions, but mainly portrays the so- called 'terms of endearment' between them and the people around their lives, and how these terms can be broken and reunited.I haven't read the book that the movie is based on, so I can't really say how James L. Brooks adapted the story. All I can say is that the story is really good in the movie's first three quarters. It has some really nice character study and powerful scenes. But after that, in the end the movie started to decline and appealed to the cliché and predictable. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but they recurred to the biggest cliché of all. The other problems I have here are with some characters, like Danny DeVito's one. He could be much more well developed. DeVito is top billed here, but doesn't appear at all in the movie, except for a couple of non-important scenes. By the end, lots of things were not explained, which really made me angry, like Aurora's relationship with Garett Breedlove, Jack Nicholson's character. But this character wasn't in the novel, so it's a nice addition. And there were lots of scenes which seemed to have only the purpose of increasing the movie's runtime, like when Emma goes to New York. Completely unnecessary.This movie is known as one of the biggest tearjerkers of all time, because of its extremely sad ending. Well, I don't find it quite so. The ending is, indeed, sad, but it is also very cliché, which completely ruined the whole experience for me. It it also didn't hit me because of James L. Brooks not so good directing. If he had only directed these parts of the movie in a better way, and included scenes that really matter, it would have made me cry. Except for the final parts, James L. Brooks directed the rest of the movie quite well. But I would be happy to see a tracking shot, though.At least the acting is one good point here. This movie has truly an all- star cast, with big names like Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger as the two leads and a supporting cast featuring Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Jeff Daniels and John Lithgow. The two main leads deliver a true show as mother and daughter. There isn't one scene were there was lack of acting with MacLaine or Winger, and Maclaine even got the Oscar for best actress that year, but in my opinion Winger deserved it more. Jack Nicholson also won the Oscar, with a good, but not great performance. In my opinion, John Lithgow deserved it more. Jeff Daniels was really good as Emma's husband, and Danny Devito almost isn't in the movie, so I can't really evaluate his performance.One thing that I was really pleased with in this movie is the Soundtrack. The main theme is quite amusing, and it is used on the right parts, only when it is necessary. Great sound editing. I also found the cinematography well-made, but I don't like the editing. Lots of scenes could've been cut off, to make the movie less boring and more interesting. The set-decoration is also excellent, extremely well done, so it's the representation of the periods on which the movie is portrayed.Overral, 'Terms of Endearment' is the kind of movie made with only two purposes: first, to make make people cry, and it could've have been way more well-succeeded on performing this task; second, to win lots of Academy Awards, and it was extremely well-succeeded on this job. The Academy loves those kinds of stories, and me too, but only when they are well represented. This movie isn't, appealing to the predictable, which is really sad, because it has some really nice acting, and the beginning was great. Good movie for a directing debut, but that's what it is. The movie is inconsistent, flawed and not that sad. Good, but could've been better. Completely overrated.6,5/10, that goes back to a 6.",Terms of Endearment
109,alcosta-197-774442,Don't believe the hype,4,6 December 2020,"This is a movie which has no script, central point, message, lesson, or anything really memorable. A bunch of ridiculous scenes, dialogues, and situations which are so far off reality it is worth of a Dali painting.The actors did a wonderful job in bringing this nonsense into a believable thing, and the superb soundtrack is able to bring tears onto otherwise a total disaster",Terms of Endearment
110,Chris-999,The movie is great.,10,28 June 2000,"Shirley MacLaine,Jack Nicholson,and Debra Winger give absolutely stunning performances in this excellent comedy/drama.Shirley MacLaine plays a single mother raising her daughter(over the years the daughter turns into Debra Winger) and how their relationship changes over 30 years and how they both find love. Jack Nicholson plays Shirley MacLaine's love interest and next door neighbor.The movie goes from excellent comedy to one of the saddest movies ever. The movie is excellent. 10/10",Terms of Endearment
111,Thaleia,Heartfelt Cries,10,8 September 1999,"A touching story of mother and daughter, this movie explores the complexities in this relationship making you laugh and cry during the process.  Filled with Academy caliber performances, this film takes hold of your heart strings and refuses to let go.  Jack Nicholson lends the strength necessary to keep it from becoming a morass of teary women and adds the light touches that make the emotional scenes so much more powerful.  Every movie fan should see it.",Terms of Endearment
