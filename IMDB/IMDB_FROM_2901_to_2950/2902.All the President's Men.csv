0,MartinHafer,"Well done, though it sure helps if you remember Watergate.",9,31 October 2015,"""All the President's Men"" is a film that would have played much, much better back in the 70s when it debuted. That is because most of the audience would have known who many of the folks were who were involved in the Watergate break-in and the subsequent attempt to derail the investigations. As a history teacher, I have a much better than normal knowledge of these people and events. But for the average viewer who isn't in their 60s, much of the film will be foreign to them and the names relatively unimportant. Now this does not mean it's a bad film for most viewers--but its impact is less-- especially since nowadays the idea of politicians being this corrupt is old news!The film has a lot of high-powered actors--not just Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford (who, by the way, looks NOTHING like Bob Woodward) but the stellar supporting cast. Additionally, the film is appropriately tense and well directed. The only negative I felt that existed in the film is the montage-like ending which just felt a bit like a tack-on and could have been stronger. Still, well worth seeing.",All the President's Men
1,bkoganbing,The Story Of A Lifetime,9,5 March 2010,"The United States Of America lost its political innocence with the Watergate scandals. The effects of what happened starting with those burglars caught breaking into the Democratic headquarters of the Watergate Apartment complex and what came afterward will damage the national psyche for the next few centuries.What always got me about Watergate is that it was so unnecessary for Richard Nixon's re-election. And that was what it was all about. Nixon was at the peak of popularity, he would have won in 1972 without all the shenanigans pulled by his Committee to Re-Elect the President. But in the possessed mind of Richard Nixon who saw enemies everywhere, it wasn't enough to just beat the Democratic opponent.It was also why the Watergate scandal took hold, the motives behind it were strictly political, to re-elect the incumbent president. Iran/Contra never got the traction that Watergate got because in the final analysis it was about foreign policy differences. The motives if not pure were not tainted with partisanship either.Films like Nixon with Anthony Hopkins and Nixon/Frost with Frank Langella give you a view of the man at the center of it all. Another rather skewered view of Watergate can be gotten from the film Born Again about Chuck Colson, one of the key players in Watergate. But this film is from the outside looking in. It takes two fairly new reporters from the Washington Post, Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein, covering the police beat of the Post who are in night court as the Watergate burglars are arraigned and slowly realize they could be sitting on the story of a lifetime.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are Woodward and Bernstein. Editor Ben Bradlee played by Jason Robards realizes that in the final analysis this is a crime story first and foremost. So rather than give it to some top political reporter, he lets Woodward and Bernstein run with it. It made their reputations down to today.Director Alan J. Pakula made clever use of the color newsreel footage and interspersed it with the dramatic story. Through the newsreels the well known names and faces actually do become actors in the proceedings.In fact despite the fact that Jason Robards won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and Jane Alexander for playing the bookkeeper at the campaign headquarters got nominated for Best Supporting Actress, the key performance in the film in my opinion is that of Robert Walden who played Donald Segretti, a young attorney who became part of the White House plumbers dirty tricks squad. He's the only one of the Watergate principals who gets a full blown fictional portrayal here. He gives the Watergate scandal the face for the viewer and its not a pretty one.All The President's Men missed the Best Picture Oscar and a Best Director for Alan J. Pakula. But it managed to win Oscars for Best Sound, Best Art&Set Direction and Best Adapted Screenplay besides the Oscar Robards won.Both Redford and Hoffman who are a couple of name players as stars gave what would be subdued performances in the sense that they never allowed their star personas to interfere with the telling of the story. That's what makes All The President's Men such a lasting classic.",All the President's Men
2,Leofwine_draca,The definitive journalism movie,9,22 April 2018,"ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is not only a stunning addition to the 1970s wave of conspiracy thrillers but also a great film dealing with the subject of journalism, up there with SPOTLIGHT as the best of its type. The story, which all true and about how two Washington Post reporters broke the Watergate scandal, is completely riveting, one of those suspense-fuelled movies that works despite not relying on generic action cliches or even an exciting score. The completely likeable Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffmann are perfectly cast as the intrepid reporters who refuse to take no for an answer, but the whole cast is spot on here. It's a film which just runs and runs and runs, ever complex yet easy to follow, that might just be one of the most important movies of the decade.",All the President's Men
3,SnoopyStyle,Hoffman and Redford energizes investigation,9,28 January 2015,"It's 1972 and there has been a break-in at the Democratic Party National headquarters at the Watergate hotel. Washington Post editor Howard Simons (Martin Balsam) assigns new reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) to cover the minor story. He is surprised to find top lawyers defending the burglars despite none of the them made a phone call. The burglars claim to have CIA connections and he soon connects them to the White House. Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) is a rough and tumble veteran local reporter who is also working the case. Simons wants to give it to more experienced writers but local news editor Harry M. Rosenfeld (Jack Warden) defend the pair. Executive editor Benjamin Bradlee (Jason Robards) keeps pushing them to dig harder. Woodward contacts his reluctant connection ""Deep Throat"" (Hal Holbrook). The two lowly reporters keep plugging away with no other paper willing to follow the story.This is a movie about real journalism or what we hope real journalism actually is. It's a lot digging, phone calls and investigating. It could have been very dry story but Hoffman and Redford energizes the movie. The movie doesn't jazz up the investigation with car chases or gun fights. This is a hard slough newspaper work. Despite the Byantine labyrinth, the investigation is still coherent for novices with a brain.",All the President's Men
4,Hitchcoc,A Sojourn into Investigative Reporting,10,30 November 2016,"The work of Redford and Hoffmann is impeccable here as are the supporting players. This, of course, is the story of the Washington Post investigation of the Watergate conspirators under the Nixon administration, specifically that of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein . It shows what happens when tips come in and the close scrutiny and support for sources that skilled journalists must adhere to. Because it was recent history, the players needed to be presented in a truly realistic way. We are introduced to Ben Bradlee, played by the wonderful Jason Robards, and all the principles involved. Hal Holbrook is the notorious ""Deepthroat."" There is a frantic pace to this as deadlines need to be met and the realities of the risks taken by the Post. Read a couple books on Watergate and then watch this. It is a gem.",All the President's Men
5,Prismark10,All the President's Men,9,18 January 2021,"Cinema of the 1970s was regarded as the era of the star studded disaster movies. The mid 70s also saw the release of several conspiracy thrillers with its roots in the Kennedy assassination.The Conversation, The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor and All the President's Men. The last two starred Robert Redford.Although Dustin Hoffman receives top billing here. It is Redford who called the shots.Redford bought the rights to Woodward and Bernstein's book. It was made by his production company. The film opens as a Robert Redford-Alan J Pakula film.The film follows junior news reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) being paired up with the more experienced Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman.) They follow up the break in at the Democratic Party National headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972.Young and hungry, they have an inkling that this is more than just a low level burglary when a top lawyer turns up at the courthouse. Woodward and Bernstein's perseverance uncovers a conspiracy that takes them to the upper echelons of President Nixon's government.All the President's Men is a dense film. It puts investigative journalism in the spotlight. You see Woodward and Bernstein doing the legwork, mainly on the phone but also talking to faces who are reluctant to divulge information.Searching for corroboration and verifiable facts. Executive editor Benjamin Bradlee (Jason Robards) is the stern boss who has learnt lessons the hard way when journalists do not do the job right. He keeps pushing the journalists to search for more leads.Given a lot of the information that the journalists get is verbal with a lack of documentary evidence. There is always the risk that Woodward and Bernstein are being played. They might be made fools of. Deep Throat who is Woodward's paranoid secret contact might be an unreliable source.William Goldman's script is smart but heavy. It is structured as a procedural that requires concentration. The characters enter a dimly lit world of car parks, double bluff, nods and winks. The movie also coined the term 'Follow the Money.'Alan J Pakula's direction is unflashy. He really does convey an atmosphere of a newsroom. There are hints of paranoia, that danger might be lurking from big government agencies. Some of the characters seem afraid to talk knowing they might burn their careers.Redford and Hoffman might look like an unlikely pairing but they bounce off each other well. Just look how Bernstein glances at Woodward when the latter admits to being a Republican.All the President's Men was Warner Brothers push for the Best Film Oscar in 1976. Like the heavyweight division in boxing at the time. There were big contenders that year such as Network and Taxi Driver. The knockout punch for the accolade of Best Picture was landed by Rocky.",All the President's Men
6,mark.waltz,Running into dead ends with brick walls at every turn.,10,10 November 2012,"""Most people don't care about Watergate anymore"", Washington Post boss Jason Robards tells his top two reporters, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, as this film begins its wrap up. But Hoffman and Redford, as Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, do care, and they persevere, especially after Robards tells them to take 15 minutes off to rest, then get back out there and finish the job. The infamous ""Deep Throat"" (Hal Holbrook, seen in shadows, that fabulous profile still obvious) gives them enough information at first to get them intrigued, but as the two fairly decent journalists persevere to get the scoop of the century, they find that a lot of people in Washington who worked for the Committee to re-elect the President (Nixon) are not willing to even have a cup of coffee with them let alone risk their lives or careers by spilling the beans. The two however refuse to leave well enough alone, and end up blowing the men working for ""Tricky Dick"" out of the water.Only days after our most recent presidential election, I re-watched this amazing drama which at 2 hours and 20 minutes is never boring. In this now classic political expose on the ruthlessness of government, it is the screenplay (by William Goldman based upon Bernstein and Woodward's book) who is the star, even though the two leading men are great in it and Robards deservedly won an Academy Award. Every word spoken by each actor rings true, and every action rings of honesty. Robards, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and John McMartin are Woodward and Bernstein's colleagues at the paper, while an ensemble of some of the best character performers around fill out the cast. Nicolas Coaster, Polly Holliday, Jane Alexander, Allyn Ann McLearie and Sloane Shelton are just among the ""real people"" they encounter while discussing such real life famous people as John Mitchell, G. Gordon Liddy and H. R. Haldeman as visuals of Nixon, Spirow Agnew and Gerald Ford are seen in real news clips.It is ironic that Hollywood released this film during the Bicentennial year to show how honesty and integrity will always be the goals of the people who elect the officials who make the decisions that guide our great country. Almost forty years later, politics is as dirty, if a bit more sinister, and the recent campaign reiterated what movies like ""Advise and Consent"" and ""The Best Man"" have been warning us about for years. Throw in ""All the King's Men"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""The Candidate"" and ""Bullworth"" as other films of interest in this category. Films and plays about Nixon have exposed more about the man we only see through newsreels here. As long as writers dare to stand up to expose truth, politicians will always live in fear that their secrets will end up being exposed, as they are here.",All the President's Men
7,classicsoncall,"""Don't you understand what you're on to?"".",8,21 August 2011,"Back in the early Seventies when the Watergate story was playing out in the press, the revelations and names just kept coming - Mitchell, Colson, Hunt, Liddy, Stans, Magruder, Haldemann, and on and on. I was in my twenties then and didn't have the patience to keep up with the daily news, but it wasn't difficult to be even semi-informed, as virtually every day there was another breaking story. When this film came out so quickly following the actual events, it was a must see, considering Redford and Hoffman in the lead roles, and supported by a strong cast of other character and leading actors of the day. Watching it present day is a good way to get a quick snapshot look at the Nixon Watergate scandal, and even if you have no interest in politics, it makes for a compelling mystery story. You're taken day by day into the world of the Washington Post and reporters Woodward (Redford) and Bernstein (Hoffman), and the obsessive investigation that resulted in keeping Watergate on the national front burner for a couple of years.The one thing I recall from watching the film when it first came out was the use of Hal Holbrook for the character of Deep Throat. I would have thought the character would be treated more mysteriously since no one outside of the principals knew who he was. Speculation even ran rampant that Deep Throat might have been a composite of several sources for the Post reporters. It's all a moot point now, as the real Deep Throat revealed himself in 2005 to be Mark Felt, the number two man at the FBI at the time. Still, to keep that secret for thirty years was no mean feat.Though the film purports to be fairly accurate in it's recollection of events, I guess my main criticism would be about the way the picture ends. Woodward and Bernstein were on to something big, and as shoe after shoe kept dropping, it's somewhat frustrating that the story ends before the special prosecutor is named and the Nixon secret tapes are revealed. It almost felt like, Oops!, the budget's run out and we have to wrap this up. Up till then though, the story held my interest pretty well, and as a condensed overview of the events surrounding Watergate, it's not a bad place to start.",All the President's Men
8,gavin6942,"Politics In A Digestible, Enjoyable Format",9,15 April 2010,"""All the President's Men"" is the true story of how the Washington Post uncovered the Watergate scandal and traced it all the way to its conclusion: that the perpetrator behind it all was President Richard Nixon.The way this story was told is perfect: we don't see the story as it actually unfolds, but in the way that Woodward and Bernstein tracked it down. This makes it not only history, but a mystery. If you didn't already know how it turns out, you could follow along and try to see whodunit. Robert Redford is a delightful and handsome lead, and Dustin Hoffman has never been a poor actor.How much the actors really look like their characters is debatable, but not really important to the story. Scandal exists every day, but not every day is it discovered: this was the big one, and an inspiration for journalists worldwide.",All the President's Men
9,lee_eisenberg,I'd like to see this happen to Bush.,10,19 July 2005,"The recent revelation that FBI agent Mark Felt was Deep Throat brings up Watergate again. I guess that if ""All the President's Men"" was made nowadays, it would be a little different. But regardless, it is a great movie. With Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford as Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, respectively, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, even though you know how it ends.Also, knowing that the Watergate scandal forced Nixon to resign, it makes us hope that Bush's shenanigans force him to resign...and then some. The truth is that Watergate wasn't the most vicious thing that Nixon ever did - that dishonorable mention goes to the escalation of the Vietnam War, the ""Dirty Tricks"" campaign to spy on protesters, and the destruction of the Black Panthers and the American Indian Movement.",All the President's Men
10,jboothmillard,All the President's Men,7,15 June 2005,"I watched this well-known film while I was in college, but I really don't think I paid the fullest attention to it, so I'm glad I decided to watch it again and get a better judgement on it, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Alan J. Pakula (Klute, Sophie's Choice, The Pelican Brief, The Devil's Own). Basically, on June 17, 1972, five burglars are arrested breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters within the Watergate complex. The next morning, new reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) at The Washington Post is assigned to cover the story, which is considered of minor importance. Woodward learns at the local courthouse that the five men had electronic bugging equipment and are represented by a high-priced ""country club"" attorney. One of the Watergate burglars, James W. McCord, Jr. (Richard Herd), identifies himself as having recently left the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), and the other men also have ties with the CIA. Woodward connects the burglars to E. Howard Hunt, a former employee of the CIA and President Richard Nixon's White House Counsel, Charles Colson. Carl Bernstein (BAFTA nominated Dustin Hoffman), another Post reporter, is assigned to cover the Watergate story with Woodward. The two young men are reluctant partners but work well together. Executive editor Benjamin Bradlee (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jason Robards) believes their work lacks reliable sources and is not worthy of the Post's front page, but he encourages further investigation. Woodward and Bernstein make various phone calls to people connected to Charles Colson and Howard Hunt, but many that answer are in denial of knowing anything about the situation or refuse to comment and hang up. Woodward contacts a senior government official, an anonymous source who refers to himself as ""Deep Throat"" (Hal Holbrook), they meet at night in an underground parking garage. Deep Throat speaks in riddles and metaphors, avoiding substantial facts about the Watergate break-in, but advises Woodward to ""follow the money."" Woodward and Bernstein manage to connect the five burglars to corrupt activities around the campaign for the re-election of President Richard Nixon, the Committee to Re-elect the President (or CREEP). This includes a cheque for $25,000 paid by Kenneth H. Dahlberg. Bradlee and others are still doubtful of the investigation and their sources, questioning why the Nixon administration should break the law when the President is almost certain to defeat his opponent, Democratic nominee George McGovern. Through former CREEP treasurer Hugh W. Sloan, Jr. (Stephen Collins), Woodward and Bernstein find evidence of hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds connecting to White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, and former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, now head of CREEP. The reporters learn that CREEP was financing a campaign to sabotage Democratic presidential candidates a year before the Watergate burglary. Judy Hoback Miller (Oscar nominated Jane Alexander), a CREEP bookkeeper, admits that she had long been aware of the secret fund and mentions a list of 15 names, which was destroyed, but refuses to disclose the names who control the secret fund, but she agrees to identify by initials. Bradlee demands thoroughness and the reporters are compelled to obtain other sources to confirm the Haldeman connection. The White House issues a non-denial denial of the Post's findings, and the editor continues to encourage investigation. Woodward again meets secretly with Deep Throat, who reveals that Haldeman masterminded the Watergate break-in and cover-up. He also states that the cover-up was not just to cover CREEP involvement but to hide ""covert operations"" involving the CIA and FBI. He warns Woodward and Bernstein that their lives, and others, are in danger. When the two relay this to Bradlee, he urges them to carry on despite the risk from Nixon's re-election. On January 20, 1973, with all significant evidence gathered, and a phone call confirming that it can go ahead, Bernstein and Woodward type the full story, while a television in the foreground shows Nixon taking the Oath of Office for his second term as president. Numerous television and newspaper reports detail the convictions and sentences of the conspirators. A montage of Watergate-related headlines is shown, and President Nixon resigned from office on August 9, 1974. Also starring Jack Warden as Harry M. Rosenfeld, BAFTA nominated Martin Balsam as Howard Simons, Ned Beatty as Martin Dardis, Meredith Baxter as Deborah Murray Sloan, F. Murray Abraham as Sergeant Paul Leeper, Henry Calvert as Bernard Barker (Watergate Burglar), Dominic Chianese as Eugenio Martínez (Watergate Burglar), Ron Hale as Frank Sturgis (Watergate Burglar), Nate Esformes as Virgilio R. Gonzales (Watergate Burglar), and Gremlins' Polly Holliday as Dardis' secretary. Redford and Hoffman give splendid performances and have an equal amount of time onscreen both together and individually, with terrific support from Robarbs, Alexander and Holbrook. The most memorable scenes for me with the phone calls to various named connections, the dark underground car park chats, and the bookkeeper interview. The Watergate scandal is a historically significant (any big media story these days has the word ""gate"" after it, e.g. ""Sharongate"" in EastEnders, ""Envelopegate"" at the Oscars, ""Punchgate"" in Celebrity Big Brother), and this film perfectly captures the multi-layered labyrinth of corruption, you have to really concentrate to get what is going on, but it is an interesting political biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for William Goldman, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Picture, and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design/Art Direction, Best Screenplay, and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Screenplay. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, Robert Redford was number 61, and Dustin Hoffman number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Hoffman was number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 57 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 34 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",All the President's Men
11,rmax304823,Superlative,10,5 August 2002,"I first read this story when it was serialized in Playboy, with neatly understated illustrations by Punchatz, one of America's premiers. I read the book too, after having kept one ear on the TV hearings. I couldn't follow any of it. I gathered that most of the pols involved were liars and cheats, but what else was new? So when this film appeared I attended it at Tanforan Mall in South San Francisco, hoping that the details would be logically laid out. No dice. I still couldn't follow it. Information was introduced into the story coming out of nowhere. What's the big deal about shredding at CREEP? Wouldn't they habitually shred all the used documents routinely. What I got instead of an exercise in ratiocination was a character study with a convoluted mystery background, kind of like Raymond Chandler without the Weltschmertz. And what a splendid study it is! Redford has never been better. The part of mid-Western WASP Woodward fits him perfectly. Tall, methodical, truthful even at his own expense, his acting is effectively minimal. He rolls his eyes at exactly the right moments. Redford stands in contrast to Hoffman's Bernstein, a short, dark, wiry, pushy Jewish macher who seems not to walk but to dart from place to place. Yet neither of them plays a stereotype; they invest their parts with genuinely differentiated personalities. The rest of the cast, down to the smallest bits, could not be improved upon. And what a cast! The cynical, tough, courageous, profane Ben Bradlee. He hands the manuscript back to Woodstein and strides away between the rows of empty desks in the newsroom, banging his knuckles lightly on one as he passes. Robards outdoes himself. Jack Warden and Martin Balsam are equally fine. (Did they reminisce about working together so closely in ""Twelve Angry Men"" fifteen or so years earlier? Probably not.) Performers like Lindsay Crouse have only a few minutes of screen time, Jane Alexander only a bit more, but they are memorable. I'll avoid going over the story and just present in no special order some of the points I found so impressive.At conferences in the Washington Post, all the editors are given to wisecracks, but they almost always check Bradlee's reactions out of the corner of their eyes.The humor, and there is some, is both verbal and physical. When Redford comments during an interview that he is a Republican, Hoffman looks up and stares at him. Redford responds with a prototypical double take. During an amusing scene in which Bradlee is having a conversation with a defensive ""frazzled"" informant, ashes fall from Hoffman's cigarette onto the couch and an annoyed Redford brushes them onto the floor. Hoffman returns from his agonizing interview with Alexander and is even more hyper than usual because he is on a caffeine jag.There is no music until half an hour into the film, and after that it is only insidiously introduced more often, mostly nothing more than variations on a minimal set of four minor notes.There are practically no show-offy bravura shots, though the photography is outstanding. One shot is memorable. A crane lifts the camera above the heads of Redford and Hoffman as they work at a circular desk in the Library of Congress. It rises impossibly high. Then, a dissolve, and it rises even higher, slowly until it must be tucked into the library's dome hanging from pulleys. I checked out that room in the Library of Congress and can't imagine how else it was done. The layout of the floor comes to resemble the rose window of a cathedral.The lighting varies from shadowy (but not underlighted) ominous scenes and sterile flourescence, sometimes, as in the garage scenes, combining both.Weaknesses are hardly worth mentioning, but I guess I could have done without some of the repetitiousness. That their ""lives are in danger"" is mentioned four times, twice during the same conversation, as if to emphasize what really needs no emphasis. The ""L, P, and M"" business also is gone over too many times. None of that detracts from the film's many virtues.What bothers me more about the story has nothing to do with the movie. After this story broke everyone seemed to want to be Woodward and Bernstein. The easiest way to do this was to go after big game. It established a new and perhaps unhealthy tradition in journalism. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a cripple. Yet, by common agreement, no shots of him in his wheelchair ever appeared in the media. For that matter, he had a comfortable menage a trois while he was in the White House, and no mention was made of it. Everyone knew about Kennedy's transgressions but they were considered a private matter in the early 1960s. Even a dullard like Eisenhower had Kay Sommersby. That's all changed now and I'm not sure the change is for the better. Do we really care that a president can use a word like (expletive deleted) in a private conversation, or whether another defines ""sexual relations"" in a way that you or I might not? Or that another might have snorted coke during the wilder days of his youth? Do we really care? SHOULD we care? The French were convulsed with laughter at us in the early 1970s. They're probably not laughing anymore.",All the President's Men
12,Tweekums,The story of two journalists who brought down a president,10,26 August 2018,"This film tells to story of Washington Post journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's investigation into a break in at the Democratic Party's headquarters in the Watergate building in Washington DC. From the start something looks wrong; four men have been arrested but it looks as if they were hired for the job; a cheque links one of the men with a member of the campaign to re-elect President Richard Nixon. No other papers are particularly interested in the story but The Post sticks with it and the two reporters doggedly follow the trail of clues that lead all the way to the White House and those closest to the president.This is one of the stories that most people will know about how it started, with the Watergate break-in, and who it ended, with the resignation of President Richard Nixon, but might not know too much about the details of the investigation that brought him down. There is no action as such and a relatively low sense of danger for most of the film but it is still gripping. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman do really great work as Woodward and Bernstein and the rest of the cast are also impressive. While it was made over forty years ago and depicts an investigation in a pre-internet era it doesn't feel dated. The way the story is filmed feels very real and this feeling of reality is increased by the use of actual news footage of certain events. Overall this is definitely a film to watch if you are interested in US politics, enjoy stories about investigative journalism or just want to watch a good film.",All the President's Men
13,ma-cortes,"Remarkable film about two intrepid reporters , Bob Woodward and Carl Berstein , who investigate the Watergate conspiracy",7,30 April 2012,"This inspired reenactment of the known political event concerns on two reporters from ¨Washington Post¨ who investigate the deeds that eventually led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, 37th President of the United States . At times it looked like it might cost them their jobs, their reputations, and maybe even their lives . Reporters Woodward (Robert Redford , also producer) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) uncover the details of the Watergate scandal that leads to President Nixon's resignation. Both of whom persevere in their investigation of Watergate break-in who led to earthshaking scandal . Their perseverance and the support of their editors (Jack Warden) revealed that the break-in at the Watergate office complex was only one small part of a much larger network of intelligence gathering activities, many of which were illegal. The flick also focuses on the role of Woodward's now legendary secret source dubbed Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook ,since identified as FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt) . Through the process, they have the obstacles of the newspaper's editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) who needs their story to be confirmed by reliable source .Redford and Hoffman play perfectly the real-life Washington Post journalists . This nice film is well developed , dealing with a docudrama in which is discovered the exposure of the Watergate conspiracy by journalists Woodward and Berstein . Best elements of newspaper movies such as intense investigation , thrills , detective story , intrigue rolled into an interesting movie . However , there are much telephonic conversation that hamper some moment the flick developing . Although we know how it eventually comes out , we're on the edge of our seats from start to finish . It won deservedly Academy Award for secondary actor , Jason Robards , for screenplay , William Goldman , and Art Direction and Sound . Furthermore , an atmospheric score by David Shire and appropriate cinematography by Gordon Willis .This gripping movie-making was professionally directed by Alan J. Pakula . He achieved several hits (Devil's own , Pelican brief , Presumed innocent , Sophie's choice , Klute) and some flops (Starting over , Paralax view, See you in the morning). The movie belongs to sub-genre that abounded in the 80s about reporters covering polemic political conflicts , such as ¨The year of living dangerously¨ by Peter Weir with Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver , ¨Under fire¨ by Robert Spottswoode with Nick Nolte , Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy, ¨Salvador¨ by Oliver Stone with James Woods and James Belushi, and ¨Deadline¨ by Nathaliel Gutman with Christopher Walken and Hywel Bennett. These movies are very much in the vein of ¨All the President's men¨. Rating : Good , well worth watching .",All the President's Men
14,moonspinner55,Hollywood comes to D.C.,6,21 January 2006,"Journalistic exploits of two Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal in 1973 which eventually lead to President Nixon's downfall and resignation. Tough, talky, but fascinating chapter of political history benefits from the odd, disparate pairing of Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, although Jason Robards got most of the kudos--and a Supporting Oscar--as newspaper editor Ben Bradlee (who is, unfortunately, turned into the very same character we've all seen sitting behind the police sergeant's desk in various crime pictures: barking at his minions to get the job done or else!). Alan J. Pakula, a director with an overwhelming sense of detail and structure, was a good choice to helm this project, but his rhythm is still doggedly slow.

Then the slump began in the eighties during which he had a stab at other kind of cinematographic genres and reached the bottom in the nineties with fiascoes such as ""the Pelican Brief"" (1993), an unconvincing attempt to find the spirit of the conspiracy movie again or ""the Devil's Own"" (1997), created in chaos.But back in 1976, he shone with this political thriller which related the scandalous Watergate affair from the relentless investigation two journalists Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) undertook. They had flair, used their reasoning and deduction faculties in a stalwart way without giving in too much to discouragement to reconstitute with tenacity and accuracy this scandal which will lead to the resignation of Nixon. All this throughout countless phone calls, conversations with witnesses who were however often reluctant to talk, intensive researches. More than half of the movie occurs in the editorial office and not only has Pakula a sense of space to make this place bright but also to captivate the viewer's attention while the two journalists pore over their research and discoveries. Technically speaking, his film commands admiration and respect: helped by the topnotch work of his photograph Gordon Willis, his camera work shines throughout the work which is also scattered by first-class sequences. The very last one of course and one of my favorites is the following one: when Hoffman goes to Redford's apartment to inform him of his new discoveries, the latter turns up the music very loud, then he begins to type on the typewriter and incites his companion to communicate through this scheme because there are mikes in the room. An ingenious way to eschew one trap their enemies set. Because all the ones who were involved in this affair try to hush it up.An affair painstakingly reconstituted as well as a documentary about the American press's work methods, a faultless directing, a visual, technical splendor and a topflight performance, what more could you ask for from a cracker that can stand (or rather) encourages multiple viewings?",All the President's Men
16,blanche-2,"seen this many times, never reviewed",10,17 June 2017,"In today's world, ""All the President's Men"" is as timely as ever. And it's a great look at the importance of journalistic integrity at a time when it was important to be right, not first.A meticulously made film, and Redford and Hoffman were at the heights of their careers and both so adorable! The cast was perfect, with Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden - all brilliant.The break-in, as we see, was a mess. In preparation for the break-in, someone had gone around the Democratic headquarters and put tape on all the doors so they wouldn't lock automatically. One of the first things you see is a guard finding one of the taped doors - that was the actual guard, and he was considered the hero of the night. One of the Republican plans was that during the convention, a yacht with prostitutes would be nearby; the Republicans would lure delegates onto the yacht and then blackmail them later. The interesting thing is how all of the people involved had no problem committing actual felonies - blackmail, embezzling, perjury, and one of the most powerful moments in the documentary is the TAPE of Nixon saying he knew where he could get a million in cash to pay people off. It was all like something out of The Sopranos, with John Mitchell threatening to put Katherine Graham's tit in a wringer if anything was published about him. Astonishing. And this was The White House.Woodward and Bernstein were like dogs with a bone, beautifully shown here as they continually pursue a story originally thought of as a waste, later called a witch hunt, and finally above-the-title news.I'm older now, obviously, than when Nixon resigned. It was hard for me to see him as a person then. Later on, transcribing his speeches and an interview - I realized that he was an amazing speaker, and his career had been absolutely brilliant. I pity him that he felt he had to do what he did. And then I remember his comments about Jews and artists on those tapes. A very complicated man who let his dark side take over.The film doesn't dwell on that, but on what Redford wanted - the mechanics of the investigation itself, the grunt work that went into getting the story.Some trivia: After this film, there was a large increase in the number of applicants to journalism schools. I'd like to point out that this took place after the movie - not the book.",All the President's Men
17,Quinoa1984,"a tight ball of a mystery movie, gets better with more viewings",10,29 March 2006,"The first time I saw All the President's Men I wasn't very impressed or, actually, that involved. But it was also also at a time when I wasn't paying much attention to what was on the screen (school-time, middle of the day, that sort of thing). After seeing it a couple more times, and from reading more and more about the Watergate/Nixon involvement and impeachment, the film has a lot more importance for me, and it does work very well as mystery-movie entertainment. You have the investigators (here also journalists) Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, working for the Washington Post, on their own digging into the break-in at the Watergate Hotel in 1972. But without much results over time they almost lose their case and story. Enter in 'Deep Throat', a special secretive informer for them, and some extra paranoia, and the case goes up a notch.This is quite a film to see in the 21st century to see how, like with today's Good Night and Good Luck, how determined, concrete investigative journalism stirred up the system and the content being relevant to the time it was created. At the time it was released, however, I wonder if the connection was even stronger to the very recent events of a scandal being uncovered leading to the impeachment of Nixon. But aside from the content, there's also how the film is put together, and its really, like GN&GL, good movie-making for a mature, thinking audience. Robert Redford is in one of his best turns (even if one could say he's just being himself, which he often is anyway in films) as Woodward, with his scenes with Deep Throat in the parking garage exquisitely intense. Dustin Hoffman is equally good as Bernstein, the sort of other head of what the editor-in-chief (played very well by Jason Robards) called 'Woodstein'. The dialog in the script is dead-on, and the storytelling just piles on and piles on what works. If it doesn't grab attention right away it's not a crutch, but an incentive to stay along with the story and see it till it's end.",All the President's Men
18,sunwarrior13,All the President's Crooked Men At Watergate,10,8 December 2011,"All the President's Men is a political thriller film based on the 1974 non-fiction book of the same name by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two journalists investigating the Watergate scandal for The Washington Post. The film featured Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively together with Jason Robards,Jack Warden,Hal Holbrook,Jane Alexander and Martin Balsam. It was written by William Goldman, and directed by Alan J. Pakula.In the story,while researching a story about a botched 1972 burglary of Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate apartment complex, green Washington Post reporters/rivals Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein stumble on a possible connection between the burglars and a White House staffer. With the circumspect approval of executive editor Ben Bradlee, the pair digs deeper. Aided by a guilt-ridden turncoat bookkeeper and the vital if cryptic guidance of Woodward's mystery source, Deep Throat ,Woodward and Bernstein ""follow the money"" all the way to the top of the Nixon administration. Despite Deep Throat's warnings that their lives are in danger, and the reluctance of older Post editors, Woodward and Bernstein are determined to get out the story of the crime and its presidential cover-up. Once Bradlee is convinced, the final teletype impassively taps out the historically explosive results. This Redford-Hoffman collaboration is one of the best political thrillers ever made.It could even be classic for many others.It was a taut, solidly acted according to the benefits of a free press and the dangers of unchecked power, made all the more effective by its origins in real-life events.Pakula's superb direction makes the film remarkably intelligent, working both as an effective thriller and as a virtually abstract charting of the dark corridors of corruption and power.Aside from that,the cast had a brilliant performance,no matter show short,for every line of characters.Finally,it is a finer political film you will not find. It should be declared a national treasure.",All the President's Men
19,Hey_Sweden,An altogether remarkable achievement.,10,4 March 2019,"Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford are aces as real-life Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who set out to solve the ""Watergate"" mystery of the 1970s, which had very far-reaching implications; major White House players were involved, and it ultimately led to 37th President Richard Nixon resigning from office.All the stars align in this impeccably written (by William Goldman, based on the factual book by Bernstein & Woodward) and directed (by Alan J. Pakula) film. It's a very long (two hours, 19 minutes) but utterly engrossing combination of newspaper stories, detective stories, and exercises in straight suspense. It's one film that can actually rely on its story to generate tension; David Shires' score is just fine, but it's only sparingly used. Goldman and Pakula use dialogue and performances to hold the viewers' attention from scene to scene. There is no shortage of characters that have been morally compromised in some way, and ""All the President's Men"" works as something of a procedural as our two protagonists follow all leads and interview ANY person who is WILLING to talk to them.Hoffman and Redford make a great team; Hoffman is the somewhat more colourful character, but he never overplays this aspect; the result is that they do feel like two very real people. They're literally surrounded by top actors, starting with Jason Robards as WP editor Ben Bradlee; Robards and Goldman won two of the films' four Oscars. (The others were for art direction / set decoration and sound.) The non-stop parade of talent includes Martin Balsam, Hal Holbrook (playing that mysterious informant, Deep Throat), Jack Warden, Jane Alexander, Ned Beatty, John McMartin, F. Murray Abraham, Dominic Chianese, Nicolas Coster, Lindsay Crouse (in her film debut), Richard Herd, Polly Holliday, James Karen, Allyn Ann McLerie, James Murtaugh, etc.One does have to pay attention to the story so they don't get lost, but the rewards are substantial; this great piece of work still stands over 40 years later as a part of the entire Watergate legacy. Text at the end reveals the fates of the key players in the conspiracy, for those who may not already know these details.Key to the pictures' success is that even people who lived through this era and this story have said that they were often on the edges of their seats.10 out of 10.",All the President's Men

21,CinemaSerf,A superb piece of cinema journalism...,8,29 March 2020,"Based on the true, ground-breaking, investigations by the Washington Post into the seemingly innocuous break-in into the Watergate Building; this film produces two of the finest performances ever committed to film. Dustin Hoffman already had some grittier parts in his repertoire; but for Robert Redford this is more of a departure from his usual roles and the rapport between the two, initially suspicious journalists, builds as we all begin to realise that there is a hell of a lot more to this than just some unlucky burglars. Jason Robards and Martin Balsam serve as the real life editorial leads at the newspaper, but also as characters we can all use to take stock during these rapidly advancing, and incriminating developments. Alan J. Pakula subtly and deftly takes us through the chronology in an enthralling manner; exposing crossing sub-plots and personalities - as well as demonstrating the palpable risks being taken by many to uncover the truth. We all know the ending, but this film is quite possibly the reason why many still recall this momentous story.",All the President's Men
22,writers_reign,Graham Cracker,7,25 September 2016,"One of the problems about making films about major real events - the assassination of JFK for example - is that everyone goes to see them on their release which, by definition, is as soon after the incident in question as possible, and then they become curiously 'dated'; presumably once the audience who were alive at the time begin to die out these films will have a new historical value so that around now any film made in the aftermath of the shooting in Sarajevo would acquire a new interest/audience. So, to watch this film, made in 1976, a couple of years after Watergate, is not such compulsive viewing as it would have been on release. I'm a great admirer of both the Goldman brothers (Bill and James) both as novelists and screenwriters and neither has ever let me down in either capacity - I do, in fact, wish that someone would get out a DVD of Soldier In The Rain, an early Bill Goldman novel filmed in the early sixties with Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen) so this was a must for me as a Goldman completist. I loved the 'in-joke' of casting Robert Walden in a minor role. Walden played Joe Rossi, the star 'investigative' reporter in the Lou Grant TV series. The proprietor, Mrs. Pynchon,, of the fictional LA Newspaper where Lou Grant was City Editor, was based on Kathleen Graham, the wife/widow of the owner of the Washington Post, which for me constituted a great tie-in. Overall, the film had a fine, gritty 'feel' and is well worth seeing.",All the President's Men
23,Boba_Fett1138,How the domino's fell.,9,25 March 2007,"If you want to know all about the Watergate scandal but you're too lazy to read a book or watch a documentary, like 80% of the world's population, this movie is the ultimate resource to learn all about Watergate. The movie now has a perfect educational value now days, though at the time when it was made, the movie was made for different motivations, since it was all still quite fresh back then.The movie is of course the ultimate example of the power of the press but the movie is also most definitely about the power of politics.The story of the two reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein begins quite innocent but the further they dig into the story the deeper and higher they get, when they learn who are all involved in the cover-up, which of course eventually even leaded to the resignation of president Nixon. They are being triggered by the vague and contradicting comments people they call and meet make. They smell something big and they completely set their teeth in the investigation and their attempts to find sources and let people get on the record, with of course the mysterious Deep Throat as their most famous and highest ranking source, though this didn't get revealed until the time that deputy director of the FBI Mark Felt in 2005 revealed that he was the source they called Deep Throat, which before that remained one of the biggest journalistic- and modern history in general mystery.The story even becomes detective-like, when they step-by-step investigate to get the next piece of the puzzle, so they can get further with their journalistic investigation to uncover who are all involved and how high it actually goes. So in essence the movie often repeats itself with its events but yet manages to remain absolutely compelling and even exciting, due to the way of lively directing and also thanks to the fine acting from the many great actors that are in the movie.It's a political movie, meaning that it features lots of talking, names and difficult words. Yet the movie always remains perfectly good to follow, which is I think mainly due to the compelling storytelling of the movie. You can thank director Alan J. Pakula and writer William Goldman for that. And I'm not even a Alan J. Pakula but this movie is just one great and relevant classic.But also the fine acting definitely helps and gets the movie some extra flair. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely great together as journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They are totally different characters with different backgrounds and ideals but yet they form a perfect investigating team. Jason Robards also plays a great role (Oscar win) and so does Jane Alexander (Oscar nomination), who's role isn't the biggest but still a very relevant one and Hal Holbrook is still the ultimate Deep Throat. I especially love how authentic the acting in the movie felt. The actors obviously messed up their lines at times, which forced them to correct themselves. I just love how they decided to keep it in the movie, to give it all a more authentic feeling.The entire movie feels authentic, also since it tells the story purely from the point of view of the two reporters. It of course also totally fits within the realistic '70's style of film-making. The movie felt with many long sequence's and uses authentic lighting and make-up.The movie easily could had been 3 hours long but instead the movie is a more acceptable 138 minutes long. The final sequence of the movie perfectly shows, in just one minute time, how all the domino's fell after the published story. A really great and creative sequence and ending in my opinion.The ultimate educational movie about the Watergate scandal and an example and inspiration for great journalism.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",All the President's Men
24,view_and_review,The Fourth Estate Heavy at Work,9,10 January 2020,"A little less than a couple of years ago Bob Woodward wrote the book ""Fear: Trump in the White House."" That's the first time I'd ever heard of him (or remember hearing of him). The book, as well as the author, were being highly touted. Woodward was called one of the best most integritous investigative journalists in the business. I bought the book on that endorsement alone.I loved it.Even then I had no idea he was one of the main reporters to help crack the Watergate scandal.When I was perusing movies that I would possibly like and saw this movie about Watergate I nearly passed on it. Watergate happened before my time and it isn't something that interests me all that much. When I read the synopsis further and saw that it was based upon Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein I was all in.""All the President's Men"" is a chance to see professional journalists working hard at their profession and doing an excellent job. It's also a chance to observe what's known as ""the fourth estate"" aka the media. If the executive, legislative, and judicial are the three branches of government then the media or the press is a de facto fourth branch.The purpose of this fourth element is to act as a counterbalance, a systemically opposite force that is to report, verify and question matters of governance and public matters, as well as commercial ones, conducted by the powers we the people have entrusted it with and bestowed upon it.Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) were wards of the fourth estate that worked tirelessly to be that counterbalance to a government out of control. ""All the President's Men"" never takes a breath. I kept waiting and waiting for the theatrical pause when we get exposition and backstory. That never happened. ATPM was work, work, work. From beginning to end we saw ""Woodstein,"" as they were called by their boss, pressing, noting, checking, typing, and pressing some more.There are no explosions, no shootouts, no chases, no murders, just honest hard reporting. Maybe that doesn't interest most people, but I think the behind the scenes look at how a major newspaper operates added to the significance of the event makes for an incredible movie.",All the President's Men

""Network"" took a cerebral, arty approach to its subject and created a blistering satire. ""All the President's Men"" is a much more straightforward thriller, along the lines of this year's ""Zodiac."" It's perhaps less ambitious than ""Network,"" but having seen Sidney Lumet's film recently I think ""President's Men"" has aged better.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play Woodward and Bernstein, the two reporters for the Washington Post who investigated and uncovered the secrets surrounding Watergate. This movie makes the job of a journalist look intolerably exciting, and indeed I've read reports that applications to journalism schools actually spiked after this movie hit theatres. There's not anything really stylistically distinguished about the movie, but it's smashingly entertaining, and director Alan J. Pakula proved once again how good he was at putting urban paranoia on screen (as he had done with ""Klute"" five years earlier).An Oscar went to Jason Robards, playing Ben Bradlee, editor of the Post, as a craggy sage, and a nomination went out to Jane Alexander, in a small but effective role as a reluctant informant.

Unless you really hate political films, there's no reason to avoid this all-star political thriller.While there have been many Watergate movies made through the decades, this one was released in 1976 while the scandal was fresh in everyone's minds. William Goldman, the screenwriter, did an enormous amount of research and consulting with the real Woodward and Bernstein to make his script as accurate as possible. All the details that are now taught in history classes are present in this movie; if you watch this one during your Nixon module instead of reading that chapter in your textbook, I guarantee you'll ace your test.As a side note, I didn't watch this movie during history class. My teacher showed us the 1999 comedy Dick, which is a hilarious spoof of All the President's Men. Everything I learned about Watergate I learned from that film, so by the time I watched All the President's Men, I couldn't stop cracking up!

It would win a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble. The writing is also amazing as well. This is real life and based on a true story. Now that we know Deep Throat, we don't need somebody to make a remake of this film. You can't bring together a finer group of people. Alan Pakula is one of the finest directors. Sadly, it did not win Best Film. I don't know who it lost too but this film is still breathtaking, addictive, and always worth watching even with editing and dubbed language over some of the cursed words. Watching Redford and Hoffman play Woodward and Bernstein is like a great roller coaster ride. You don't want to watch but you can't imagine not at times. As journalists, they show the rigid dead ends of life before the computer age. Remember manual typewriters, no answering machines, library card catalogs, and paper records. The scene in which they are digging endlessly for receipts remind us of their hard work, sleepless nights, dead ends, answers from few brave souls who confessed about greed, money, lies, and corruption in our government. Imagine a simple burglary opened a Pandora's Box of American corruption. You still have to wonder about the people involved for real.

Most of the first 30 minutes moves from one conversation to the next, but your attention is held fast by a cast-iron grip. That the filmmakers can make several minutes of Redford making call after call at his desk gripping is awe-inspiring. And the dialogue between the characters (not just lead, but supporting, also) carries an authenticity you don't often see. Men engaging in heated discussion, talking over one another that makes you forget these people are reciting lines; it rings true-to-life and these actors disappear into genuine newsmen.And while ""All the President's Men"" makes heroes out of Woodward and Bernstein, it by no means glamorizes their job. It's because of the hours upon hours of work they put in, their dogged determination that the story breaks. Hoffman and Redford have a natural chemistry, and two newspapermen become classic movie characters for it.This is a powerful movie; riveting, very well-made and for my money, the ultimate political thriller.

32,MovieAddict2016,Required viewing.,10,25 March 2004,"If you were to imagine yourself as a newspaper journalist, one of the best conspiracies you could ever find yourself stumbling upon would undoubtedly be the infamous Watergate Scandal. And reporters Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) were the two men who found themselves head-above-water in an elaborate cover-up that went all the way up the chain of command to the United States President himself.On June 17th, 1972, Watergate hotel security guard Frank Wills spotted a possible break-in at the Democratic Party's National Committee. Some apparent CIA agents were arrested for breaking and entering, and later held at a trial, where Bob Woodward first found out that they were more than mere intruders. They worked for the government.After researching into the matter, Woodward soon realized that one of the intruders had the name of a political figure scrawled in a notebook located within his shirt pocket. And with the help of Carl Bernstein, a fellow Washington Post reporter (and a veteran of the field), Woodward followed the slight tracks, and the two men soon found themselves unearthing a shattering conspiracy that did indeed lead all the way up to President Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the United States of America, himself.Based on Woodward and Bernstein's own memoirs, William Goldman's Oscar-winning script makes for a brilliant subtle mystery; a true-life story as amazingly honest and forthright as it is entertaining and engaging. It would always remain the late Alan J. Pakula's greatest film, and its standing as one of the top films of all time on many various ""great movies lists"" is certainly merited. It's a shame that both Hoffman and Redford were snubbed by the Academy Awards for their performances here. As Woodward and Bernstein, the two are amazingly convincing and bounce dialogue off of each other with striking clarity and realistic quality. Hoffman, who is top billed, appears in the film less than Redford, but gives just a performance just as amazing. He would gain an Oscar twelve years later for his portrayal of Raymond Babbitt in ""Rain Man,"" his finest performance to date, but his role in ""All the President's Men"" is of a different caliber. Woodward and Bernstein are two complete opposites, and at first they rub each other the wrong way -- Bernstein, a veteran reporter, takes one of Woodward's articles and starts making revisions. ""I don't mind what you did,"" Woodward says, ""I just mind how you did it."" Even though it's not anything special, this if my favorite scene in the movie, and perhaps the best example of just how well these two actors are able to bring their characters to life.The movie is a mystery but not in the traditional sense. Almost all of us watching the film already know how the story is going to turn out, but the way it makes its dynamic revelations seem surprising and its story tense and exciting is one of the greatest examples of compelling filmmaking.
For the film's opening sequence, in which Woodward and Bernstein's condemning news is written on a typewriter, Pakula used sounds of gunshots to clarify each separate key of the device striking downwards. The 37th President of the United States of America was sentenced to a sort of death with the publishing of that article, and the bold gunshots add an extra depth and meaning to this fact.""All the President's Men"" has no hidden morals, messages, meanings. It's just a true story about something that happened, brought to life on the big screen by a great director, an influential screenwriter and two of the best actors of all time.

33,lasttimeisaw,All The President's Men,8,14 August 2010,"As an outsider, I am not interested in the notorious Watergate scandal, as I truly believe that history is doomed to be forgot as long as time goes on eternally. The importance of what Nixon did was equally trivial compared with anyone else in the world (for example a journalist) in a long run. So generally political films were barely able to arouse my interest, but this one is an exception.I think the film cleverly put its center of gravity in the conducts of these two ordinary protagonists instead of a series of political figures. The fascinating part of this film lies in the process of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two young rookie journalists, how they cope with the immense pressure and internal fear to persist their work, which outshines its contemporary peers.Pitifully I am not familiar with director Alan's other work (I need to watch KLUTE and SOPHIE'S CHOICE desperately), but he manages nicely with the pace of the narrative and make the mundane procedures of journalists quite gripping. Surely a part of which should accredit to the DP(Gordon Willis), apart from the creepy scenes with Deep Throat in the parking lot at 2 a.m., several overlooking shots are fantastically matching with the cruel pettiness of each individual. The film won Best Supporting Actor for Jason Robards (a decent win) and a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Jane Alexander (a mesmerizing 8-minute performance) plus other winning and major nominations in the Oscar (as it was a box office hit at that year too), unfortunately didn't won Best Picture or Best Director. Interestingly this film boosts the image of journalism, which I do show more respect to after watching it, but strangely enough at the same time it also kills its charisma too, as before I do have a passion to switch to become a journalist, but now, I feel more reluctant because as a journalist, your written work always means less than the topic, I don't want to become a paparazzi regardless it is political or recreational. After all it is a well-done mainstream political thriller (owing a lot to Redford's endeavor as the producer, I am looking forward to his new film as a director this year, THE CONSPIRATOR, also a political thriller), it proves that Hollywood occasionally could export some good stuff besides huge quantities of instant garbages.http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",All the President's Men
34,sddavis63,An Interesting Story That Stumbles A Bit At The End,6,11 March 2010,"Not so much a political thriller, this movie (and the book on which it's based) serves as an excellent introduction for the viewer to the inside workings of investigative journalism, as Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein struggle to put together the pieces of the Watergate break-in, and get led progressively higher and higher into the members of Richard Nixon's administration. It's truly fascinating to watch the scandal as it unfolds from a minor and puzzling break-in to a major political scandal implicating the White House itself. There's a good study of the initial suspicion of Woodward and Berstein toward each other, which quickly evolves into them working as a team, a good look at the battle within the Post itself about how far to go with the story, and a revolving door of possible contacts and sources, all of whom try to weasel out of saying anything concrete for the record.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman put on very strong performances as Woodward and Bernstein respectively, and were totally convincing in the roles. Remember that this movie doesn't focus on the scandal itself but on the investigation into the scandal, so it lacks any sustained ""excitement"" but certainly comes across as extremely interesting. I thought the ending was too abrupt. We basically get to the point of Woodward and Bernstein implicating Nixon's chief of staff Bob Haldemand in the scandal, and then to Nixon's second inauguration, after which the fates of all the major players (including Nixon himself) are relayed as headlines coming across on a teletype machine. To me, that represented a weakness. There was surely far more investigative journalism over the next year and a half as the scandal that led eventually to Nixon's resignation was fleshed out. So, the ending stumbled a bit. Still, it's enjoyable and interesting. 6/10",All the President's Men
35,sol1218,I know we have enemies but I didn't know we were that popular,8,17 October 2008,"Long but never boring film despite it's almost unlimited cast of characters about the infamous Watergate break-in and the cover-up that followed. A cover-up that lead to the resignation of the then President Richard M. Nixon and the conviction of dozens of his aids up to his former as well as acting, at the time, Attorney General and White House Chief of Staff.Based on the book ""All the President's Men"" by the two Washington Post reporters who broke the story Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, Dustin Hoffman & Robert Redford,the film starts just three weeks before the Watergate break-in on June 1, 1972 when President Nixon came back home to Washington D.C after his triumphant state visit to Communist China. In a Presidential Election campaign that was his to lose with President Nixon well ahead in the polls, against his Democratic challenger George McGovern, he did everything to not just win, which was a forgone conclusion, the Presidential Election but to protect those, the Watergate burglar's, who in fact put his stay in the White House in jeopardy!What was referred to as a third rate burglary, by President Nixon and his supporters, metastasized into a cancerous growth on the presidency that destroyed not only Richard Nixon's career in politics but almost had him indited tried and convicted of possible crimes, which Nixon's successor in the White House Gerald Ford pardoned him of, against the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. The two documents that Nixon was sworn to uphold protect and defend when he was inaugurated, twice, as President of the United States of America.The film has both Woodward and Bernstein following up a number of leads that seemed to lead nowhere in who was behind the Watergate break-in. With their investigation hitting one brick wall after another in pops the mysterious and shadowy Deep Throats, Hal Holbrook, who tips off reporter Woodward to what's behind the break-in in a number of vital clues he cryptically hands him.This has both Woodward and Bernstein discover a secret slush fund run by non other then the former Attorney General in the Nixon Administration John Mitchell! Mitchell is now in charge of CREEP-The Committee to Reelect the President-and the secret slush fund is being used to destroy any of Nixon's Democratic opponents, Ed Kennedy Ed Muskie and George McGovern, who will end up running against him for the presidency. What's even worse is that Mitchell & Co are using slush fund money and their political clout to control the F.B.I C.I.A and Justice Department, in covering up the break-in, and thus undermining the US Constitution itself!As it eventually turned out it was Richard Nixon who did more to destroy his presidency then Woodward Bernstein and their boss at the Washington Post Ben Bradlee, Jason Robards, all put together. Instead of Nixon letting the Wateregate burglars twist in the wind and not having him stick his neck, by using his power as President,out in saving their a**es-until at least after the 1972 election- the investigation of the break-in and who was behind it would have ended right there and then. The Watergate break-in would have been dismissed by the news media, including the Washington Post, as the work of a few overzealous Nixon campaign workers and nothing more.P.S What's even more ironic as well as sad, for Richard Nixon, is that after the 1972 election that Richard Nixon was reelected by the biggest vote percentage, over 60%, in US Presidential Election History he could easily have gotten the Watergate burglars off legally by just pardoning them! Something Richard Nixon should have seriously thought about before breaking the law and not only having the burglars face, and later serve, long prison sentences but having himself put into the position of joining them behind bars as well!",All the President's Men
36,Lejink,Vice president...,8,21 October 2009,"I've had this movie taped for a long time and kept putting off the pleasure I knew I'd get from viewing it until I was sparked by recently watching Kevin MacDonald's excellent modern-day fictional journalistic thriller ""State of Play"" to find Pakula's 70's drama put forward as an inspiration and for some scenes, indeed, a template for his film. Also as a young man in the 70's I remember avidly reading the source book by Wood-stein, the composite abbreviation for the two investigative journalists, add to which I'm a fan of Pakula's socially conscious but detached style anyway (especially ""The Parallax View"" from a couple of years earlier) so that I gladly settled in for the night to view this lengthy feature.Like his earlier ""Klute"" and ""The Parallax View"", Pakula gets your attention straight away with an arresting opening image - this time that gun-shot type report that the typewriter makes as it hammers out the dateline for the action which is about to follow. The thing is of course that this would have been almost as good a film as it turns out to be even if the events portrayed were fictional, but of course there's that extra frisson knowing that the events and people depicted are real and contemporary.The star-power of the two leads could also have blown credibility out of the water but whilst you're pretty much always aware that it's Redford & Hoffman you're watching, nevertheless they unquestionably fully immerse themselves in the parts, especially as they beetle about the everyday, frustrating, often boring part of being a reporter. They're backed by a top-rate supporting cast, prominent amongst these being Jason Robards, Ned Beatty & Martin Balsam. The environment of a big newspaper office is especially well conveyed in the sprawling working area.The cinematography, as usual with Pakula, is first rate, particularly the night shots of Redford/Woodward's encounters with the mysterious ""Deep Throat"" in the underground car park. Pakula keeps giving us the same long-shot of Redford's tiny figure going downstairs into the car park, which, mythical connotations apart, only further emphasises his smallness against the scale of the giant task he and his paper are taking on. The attention to detail is particularly gripping, the way that the journalists check and cross-verify their sources before daring to go to print - who'd have thought a newspaper procedural could be so involving.The main reason for this of course is the prize at the end of the trail as Woodward and Bernstein, in the famous phrase ""follow the money"" all the way to Tricky Dicky Nixon's White House culminating in his resignation and the conviction and imprisonment of most of his underlings. The only thing I didn't like really was the, to me, rushed finish. Even as I got the irony in Nixon's televised acceptance speech in early 1973 playing on a newsroom TV while the reporters keep typing, obviously continuing the investigation until the purge of the president's men is complete, it felt forced. Archive footage of Nixon and Agnew is used elsewhere in the film and therefore I can't think why Nixon's famous televised speeches as the case engulfed him, particularly his resignation speech, were ignored. There's no single moment where the link to Nixon (and his infamous White House tapes) is made which I hope wasn't made out of expediency.That carp apart, this film was one of the dramatic highlights of 70's Hollywood movie-making representing bravery on the part of its producers (Redford amongst them) to get out there this defiant defence of freedom of speech and the press in gone-wrong 70's America. Hail to the thief indeed!",All the President's Men
37,ElMaruecan82,"""Taxi Driver""'s gripping realism, ""Network""'s audacious intelligence and ""Rocky""'s inspirational message, combined in one film ...",9,17 May 2011,"Is it me, or do I feel like I need to watch ""All The President's Men"" again before reviewing it? I don't know if I should feel enthusiastic about the gripping thriller that captivated me during more than one hour and half, or angry towards this intricate script whose intelligence exceeded the limits of my understanding. Well, I had enough trouble to try to remember 'who was who' in this cinematic puzzle, so I prefer to spare myself a sterile dilemma  and let me just say that I probably didn't get 85% of the film, but overall, for what it was, I really enjoyed it.I know I'm a bit harsh, but it's not meant as an attempt to diminish the pedagogic and entertaining value of Alan J. Pakula's film: I've learned more about journalistic techniques of investigation thanks to this movie than any other. Besides, this film has the merit not to fall into clichés we would expect in a drama involving one of the most featured professions in the big screen. No, we don't need to get immersed in the private lives of Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman), to know if they're womanizers or not, or to get a whole introspection into their personal motives. The movie's premise won't be praised enough for its simplicity; it's about two journalists investigating the Watergate scandal, feeling this could lead to an even bigger political earthquake that may shake the countries' bigger instances. FBI, CIA, White House, you name it. It's about that, and no other subplot, romantic or not, will deviate this film from this clear trajectory.But a clear trajectory is not exempted from many wrong tracks, dead ends, long pauses and so on and so forth. The tightness of the script combined with the fast-paced editing and the acting so natural, you totally forget you're watching Hoffman and Redford, all these factors create the feeling of an exhausting road movie where the quest is the truth, and the way to get it is paved of many questions, meetings, informers, phone calls, and other journalistic tricks to deliver parcels of knowledge from the mouths of people. This quest provides some of the most memorable scenes of the film, including the meetings with Hal Holbrook, as the enigmatic Deep Throat, a character so fascinating, it's like reality has been even more creative than fiction, I'm sure he inspired the Cigarette Smoking Man from ""X-Files"". The whole movie is filled with many moments rooted in Pop-Culture, it made my enjoyment bigger because I watched a Simpson's parody before it. ""All The President's Men"" features many encounters with supporting characters, it has probably inspired Oliver Stone's JFK, informers as so many pieces of a giant puzzle until it gets to something. This is the thrilling element of the film, and kudos to Alan J. Pakula who made such a tense and gripping film with absolutely no death, and considering the fact we all know how it will end, the movie's climax rewards our expectations quite well.Pakula's direction is so confident it didn't embarrass itself with an ending made of laughs and cheers, the victory is written in bold letters by a cold typewriter. And for some reason, the mention of what happened this day of August 9, 1974, after the climactic typing sequence is so satisfying that we do cheer inside ourselves as the quest has come to an end, and that Truth, Justice, and Civil Rights have won. The whole movie is full of these detached moments featuring Bernstein and Woodward as the tools Truth used to compromise Nixon. In the iconic library scene, the famous zoom out is a way to show our two men drown in an ocean of interrogations, with providence as only life-belt. In fact, let's admit it, ""Woodstein"" had also a lot of luck in their investigation but that may be a proof that there was a kind of divine justice, almost poetic, that lead them to victory. Maybe they deserve, after all, their spot as #27 in AFI's Top 50 heroes, as they're true models of self-confidence, moral determination and perseverance guided by both a journalistic and unknowingly humanistic instinct. Pakula's direction is flawless in the film as it managed to create so much empathy to these characters, combined with a growing paranoid feeling indicating that they're starting to swim into troubled waters. If I wasn't so biased towards ""Rocky"", I would probably have given the Oscar to the late director.1976 was indeed an incredible cinematic year, where four classics had to compete for the supreme honor. Yet, ""Rocky"" won, and I guess, I'm in the minority satisfied with this result, for I had a small critic for each of ""Taxi Driver"", too dark, ""Network"", a script that was the real star and a too abrupt ending, and ""All the President's Men"" which sinned by trying to be too intelligent. Yes, as I stated before, I felt like Pakula overestimated our ability to memorize so many names in one film. Sometimes, I just had to get the satisfaction from the feeling they were on something, more than the way they did. I didn't feel stupid but a bit frustrated, and when this sensation gets repetitive, it doesn't help. But for the directing, the editing, and the great performances, with a honorable mention to Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, his Oscar-winning role, ""All The President's Men"" deserves a place among the greatest political thrillers of the 70's, and the best death-less thrillers ... like ""12 Angry Men"", which also features Martin Balsam, an actor I have a real fondness for.A gripping realism à la ""Taxi Driver"", a Lumet-ian directing a la ""Network"" and an inspirational message à la ""Rocky"", I wonder, if after all, I didn't judge the movie too severely and if ""All The President's Men"" doesn't make the perfect combination of ""All the 1976 Great Films""",All the President's Men
38,paul2001sw-1,Truth is stranger...,9,10 April 2005,"A central problem for all thrillers is that the need to find twist after clever twist means that stories escalate quickly into realms of implausibility; an apparently boring tale of low level corruption soon brings down the President of the United States. Which gives 'All the President's Men' a huge advantage over most thrillers, because this film (based on the Watergate incident in 1972) can tell such a story and support it on the basis that all of it is true. Director Alan Pakula, something of a conspiracy thriller specialist, here does a great job in adapting the book written by the journalists who broke the story: the film is never overly melodramatic, but is always tense, and although it has pair of heroes, we're left in no doubt of their selfish motivations as they work potential witnesses any way they can in their bid to nail the truth. Unlike most clichéd detective thrillers, the true nature of the crime is unknown (and arguably, remains unknown to this day), so even though we know what happened, there's an air of unpredictability to the story; reporters Woodward (played by Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) don't know what they are looking for, even though they are certain that (somewhere) it is there. The plot is nicely paced, and even dares to skip lightly over the eventual vindication of the journalist's hunches, preferring to concentrate on how it felt for them, chasing this huge story, over a mere historical reconstruction of President Nixon's demise. Indeed, although Nixon appears in this film, it's only on television, and played by himself. This means that what we don't get is a wider analysis: a theory as to the true motive of Nixon's actions is hinted at but nothing more; nor does the film tell us whether it regards his behaviour as a disgrace to modern politics, or an mere symptom of them. In this respect, Oliver Stone's (more fanciful) 'Nixon' makes an interesting companion piece. But as a complex, gripping and understated thriller, 'All the President's Men' has few equals. Truth is stranger than fiction indeed.",All the President's Men
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,...couldn't put Nixon together again.,7,28 February 2019,"'All The President's Men (1976)' kicks off perhaps the most unassuming - and, indeed, unwitting - 'cinematic universe', which includes (but certainly isn't limited to) what's essentially its immediate prequel, 'The Post (2017)'. It also unravels an important, surprisingly relevant period in American history that's so convoluted, secretive and downright shocking that it seems like something straight out of a spy novel. I didn't really know the ins and outs of the whole 'Watergate' scandal, or its ensuing implications, apart from the fact that it caused Richard 'I am not a crook' Nixon to resign almost immediately after he said he wouldn't. Therefore, the feature - which is based on Woodward and Bernstein's book of the same name - actually educated me quite a bit and left me eager to learn more after its conclusion, which somewhat sadly rushes over most the cathartic stuff in text form but only to keep the story focused on the determined reporting that broke the story in the first place. What it does so brilliantly, however, is not get bogged down in the facts or usual 'bio-pic' formula. It constantly keeps its eye on its two central characters, who don't necessarily have huge arcs but are both rendered realistically, and makes sure to introduce information in an investigative way. We learn things how and when the characters do, wrapped up in their detective work and constantly feeling their emotions. With each new revelation, we share their elation, frustration, shock and fear. It's fantastic, fascinating stuff that keeps you engaged throughout. I do, however, acknowledge that I might have been slightly less invested if I had known the details of the story going in, regardless of its 'real-life' relevancy. I know it's not incredibly helpful to judge a movie based on its historical accuracy, but I can't deny that it adds a little something if a movie is as accurate as this one apparently is. Overall, the experience is a surprisingly entertaining and informative one. It also clearly inspires so many pictures of the kind, with its long lenses, long takes and naturalistic performances all combining to create a subtle, 'real-world' feel. It's probably the best in its sub-genre. 7/10",All the President's Men
40,ThomasDrufke,Fascinating Execution,8,19 November 2015,"Even if the story of Watergate itself wasn't as interesting as it is, this film would probably be just as good. All the President's Men is a fascinating portrait of how two men took down a president. But more importantly, it really captures the chaotic life of an investigative journalist. The story is obviously devastating for many people across America, but by far the best part about this film is watching the events unfold in a unique way through Alan Pukula's directing. So much of films now in days take and are inspired from this movie.Centered around Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who were for all intents and purposes two of the most important men in the history of American journalism, but also ironically some of the only people who dared even go near the Watergate Scandal. The film can get confusing sometimes with all the dozens of names that are thrown around and who's working for who or who is telling the truth, but that's why the film works. Not only does it keep you on the edge of your seat even when we all know the ending, but you find yourself raising your eyebrows at events that seem absolutely unreasonable.It won the Oscar for best screenplay which is fine, but I think it's a crime Pukula didn't win for directing. I think Pukula took what is probably a great book, and enhanced it significantly. The screenplay is solid, but it's the camera angles, editing, and acting that take the film to the next level. It's a rare film in which I'm more interested in how it was made over the actual story the film is based on.Aside from the great technical aspects, it's interesting to watch Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford's performances change over the course of the film. Hoffman is evidently more aggressive than Redord, but as the story takes it's many turns and tensions arise, the roles are reversed. As a writer myself, it was just very interesting to watch the tactics each writer used in order to get information. All the President's Men has a great story, performances, and many other things, but I was most impressed with the technical side of this film.+Directing+Camera angles, long takes+Role reversal with the two writers8.5/10",All the President's Men

What I liked about this film is that it does not deal with results, but it deals with how the whole scandal was uncovered. I am a big history buff, so this kind of film is up my alley. I must warn viewers that this film can and will be very boring if you are not into these kind of films. This film is almost all talk and no action. But, this film is boosted by a riveting screenplay and wonderful acting.Alan J. Pakula's film is about two reporters at the Washington Post, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward who risk their careers and even their lives to uncover the truth about what happened at Watergate.The acting is the strong point of the film. If this film didn't have decent acting, this would have failed. But the film was carried justly by Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, and Jason Robards. I almost think it was a crime that Hoffman and Redford were not nominated much when it came to the award season.Overall, this is a very good film when it comes to correctly telling the history. This is a good drama overall, but I felt this film was a little too long for my liking. Even as a big fan of history, I felt like some scenes dragged on. But nonetheless, we got ourselves a very good, accurate film about Watergate. I rate this film 8/10.",All the President's Men

Himself and Robert Redford were absolutely brilliant together. They really should've done more movies with each other, it would make more sense!In relation to this movie, it really opens your eyes of how Richard Nixon was such a crook. Sure every poliction you meet is a greedy crook anyway so he ain't the only one in that sense! The case really interests you as in how everything went bellyup and out of control. The real Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward didn't have an easy life in their careers. They pretty much had like a rough time to get the information that needed from Nixons people to be on the Washington Post.

Warden and Balsam, two of the ""12 Angry Men,"" are fine as senior editors while Robards is marvelous as executive editor Ben Bradlee.

44,The-Sarkologist,The film version of the fall of Richard Nixon,7,23 September 2011,"This movie is based on the Watergate incident and follows two reporters, Woodwood (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman, who is very young here) as they try to find the big story behind this incident. This movie is more of a historical narrative than a thematic movie. It explores the nature of how the government covered up an embarrassing incident where the Republican Re-election committee had the offices of the Democrats bugged, but were caught before the bugs were laid. The incident happened in 1971, and went through Nixon's re-election campaign. It was after Nixon was re-elected that everything was revealed and an embarrassing President had to resign. This is a good movie in the sense that it follows the events of how Woodwood and Bernstien continued to dig into the Watergate incident even though there was a lot of opposition. It gives us a clear idea of what happened during the event, even though there is probably a bit of Hollywood extravagance connected with it. This movie has been listed in my American History notes as one to watch and what makes it even more interesting is that is was made very close to the event, that is 1976. This is different to a lot of other such historical movies like JFK as it is very close to the time it happened, at a time when people began to distrust the government due to the event. It isn't a movie trying to encourage us to trust the government, but rather a movie that uses a real incident to remind us that if an oppressive government does come in then we can be assured that it will not remain.",All the President's Men
45,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Powerful, Thrilling, Explosive and Still Relevant",10,13 November 2010,"Based on the book of same name written by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, the film version of ""All the President's Men"" is an account of the news coverage by The Washington Post on the Watergate scandal in 1972. Directed by Alan J.Pakula and one of the most important films ever made, this title is often mentioned in journalism classes and it is considered the greatest film about the press, and the students or future journalism students must see it and learn a lot from it.It shows how to make a tiny little story into a big one; the ethical aspects of a coverage; all the journalists tricks, relationship with sources; the way difficult texts must be written and how to connect thousands of facts and references altogether without confusing your colleagues, the editor and the readers. The reporters work is really like the one made by detectives, it's a complete investigation and the movie screenplay knew that and it made an impressive report about the investigative journalism. Bernstein and Woodward, the reporters who covered the story are played by Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, respectively and here we follow them from the day when the Watergate invasion happened and it was treated by the media as something irrelevant, of minor repercussion, until president Nixon's last day in the office resigning after his involvement in the scandal. In the middle of that comes the most interesting and dazzling aspect of the film and that is the whole investigation made by these two wonderful reporters, searching clues, questioning everyone involved directly or indirectly with the burglaries and the passionate commitment with the story that this young reporters have.Also presented in the film is the day-by-day of a newsroom, the work relationship between journalists, editors (played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden among others) and the executive-editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) who calls the shots of everything that comes out of the newspaper, interfering in the story when needed. And at last but not least, on the top of the most precious aspect of the whole news coverage is Woodward's informant the mysterious Deep Throat (Hal Holblrook eclipsed in shadows), a confidential source who helped the story follow its path into the media as being one of the greatest politic scandals in America. Now everybody knows that he was an important FBI director but back then in 1972 only Woodstein (as the two reporters were called) knew who Deep Throat was. And the meeting scenes are very well made giving tension to the audience, everything they were doing was risky and the people involved with the scandal were very dangerous and since you couldn't trust in your own government in who will you trust? No one. Pakula was a master in balance thriller and drama without disappoint the viewers in all movies he made, but here you got his best work. But I must thank writer William Goldman for finding the right way of presenting a story filled with references, names, situations without making something boring. The way Goldman dealt with such an complete and very hard to handle material was brilliant. It inspires journalists and future professionals of the area until today. But I advise you to make a research about everything involving the Watergate story if you never watched the film before because it involves a lot of political references and if you don't know one name you might get very lost, but nothing so compromising that makes you being pushed away from this classic.Hoffman and Redford were at their best moment, both are great and there's no way you can compare who's best on scene, they're equally great. Jason Robars won the Oscar of Supporting Actor for playing the journalist mentor and chief, and every time I watch his performance here I found it better and better, an well deserved Oscar. Along with Robards's Oscar ""All the President's Men"" also won the award for Best Art-Direction, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay (the second award for Goldman). Tough contender at that year along with ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Network"", these three wonderful films were wronged and lost out the top prize to ""Rocky"". One of the clues that Woodward gets with Deep Throat about who were involved in the scheme is ""Follow the money!"". Looks like the Academy followed the money that year and gave the Best Picture Award to ""Rocky"" who had the biggest box-office in 1976. I like both movies but ""All the President's Men"" stands out for being more courageous, more powerful and still relevant to the date. 10/10",All the President's Men

It's mind-boggling to think that what they uncovered Back Then didn't bring about the much-needed CHANGE in our now-legalized Corrupt system.

Imagine: LEGALIZED CORRUPTION, legalized by the Corrupt; the fixing of elections by family members of the candidates; the wanton invasions of any and all countries where planet-killing Toxins are discovered, just so the biggest and most powerful Company in the world- U$- can profit from Mass Suicide/Genocide; the arrogant ignorance of ""elected"" officials who thumb their noses at anyone and everyone who questions their Ulterior Motives, etc.) There's absolutely NOTHING that Politicians of ANY Denomination should be hiding from the Public (who elected them in the first place): surveillance cameras should be on any business conducted in The White House, 24 hours a day, seven days a week- and any politician found LYING should be liable to prosecution by his/her constituents. Assessments should be made of every candidate: test their knowledge of American and World history. Any Mental or Physical Health problems should factor into their Eligibility for Office: and no one above Retirement Age should be in office of any kind; this would prevent Stasis. Any elected official should be paid Minimum Wage- take the monetary corruption out of politics; the only real incentive should be a desire to MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR ALL. All elections should be done by MAIL and ANY Bill or Amendment or Rider should be voted on by any and all Voters. And that's just for Starters...",All the President's Men
47,Petey-10,All the shameful things politicians do,10,13 June 2008,"June 17, 1972.Five men are arrested after breaking and entering into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel complex.This becomes a national scandal that eventually leads to the resignation of President Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974.Two Washingon Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein do a lot of work to find all the dirt that is involved in the story.Their job was never easy because people had hard times naming names of the ones involved.Woodward was helped a little by a man they called Deep Throat.The identity of Deep Throat was kept in secret.It wasn't until 2005 when it was announced that a man named William Mark Felt Sr, Deputy Director of the FBI, then 91, was Deep Throat.Alan J.Pakula's movie is a masterpiece of political thrillers.The tension is kept on from the very first second till the end.All the President's Men (1976) is based on the book written by those two brave men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.It was Robert Redford who made this picture possible.He saw a story that needed to be made into a movie.He was also the right man to be performing Bob Woodward.And as Carl Bernstein we get to see the brilliant Dustin Hoffman.These two men share an awful lot of chemistry together.Just like Woodward and Bernstein did.And the rest of the cast isn't any lesser.Jason Robards is very fine as the legendary managing editor of Washington Post.Jack Warden plays Harry M.Rosenfeld.Martin Balsam plays Howard Simons, the man who came up with the name ""Deep Throat"" for the man with classified information.Hal Holbrook plays this man of the shadows and what a fine job he does.Jane Alexander is Judy Hoback.Ned Beatty performs Martin Dardis.Stephen Collins plays Hugh Sloan.Meredith Baxter, who became known as Elyse Keaton of Family Ties during next decade, plays his wife Debbie Sloan.Robert Walden is Donald Segretti.F.Murray Abraham plays Sgt.Paul Leeper.Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos is Eugenio R.Martinez.Richard Herd is James W.McCord Jr.The legendary news anchor Walter Cronkite is heard there.He and many other people who were there spoke on the DVD features.I learned a lot from this movie.It's full of memorable scenes.One fine scene is where Bob thinks their lives are in danger and so he plays music very loud and starts typing.And when the television shows Gerald R.Ford announcing Richard Nixon for the second term while Bob and Carl are writing his doom.This is a winner of four Academy Awards.It included William Goldman for writing while Jason Robards got one for his performance.All that stuff that took place then were still pretty fresh when this movie was made.It's important for the modern viewers to watch this movie now so we know what happened.And this movie remains current today because we will always have rotten politicians, those who only think of their own interest.That's why we need movies like this, to show us how these people work.",All the President's Men
48,leplatypus,Reality bores ! (DVD),4,2 May 2009,"This movie ends my Nixon trilogy after having seen ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Nixon"". Among the tree, it is the most accurate movie thus being the weakest.There isn't any drama: it's the facts, all the facts but only the facts. And as it deals with Watergate, the facts are very complicated, very hard to follow and if I haven't seen the other movies before or browsed Internet while this watching, I would have feel terribly lost.In addition, as Oliver Stone cleverly recalls, the Post crusade didn't give birth to the Watergate scandal, just kept it to the attention of the American people. The really stars in the Watergate are the judges, who decided to open this case. That's why the movie stops where the press has stopped and ends abruptly without any senate testimonies or anything. So, it's not really about the Nixon cover-up but about the dirty tricks he and his men did with their ""plumbers"" team.But, as the movies was released in 1976, you have the best mood of this period: the clothes, the cars, the society: just look at Redford's suit, being the same color as his blonde hairs.

It is a piece of history, it is slightly fabricated, but still a good representation of Nixon and the level of audacity that Nixon thought he was some sort of god. Untouchable.Redford and Hoffman make a great pair but they don't represent Woodward and Bernstein physically, but they represent the energy of two reporters who are hungry for a story. They bring a lot to the screen and allow the viewer to feel the investigative process, digging deep in to a story which on the surface could have been overlooked, but because they probed the scratch on the surface, they found deeper problems.Overall, this is a really good movie. Simple. No CG. Only intrigue and detective work. It starts small, then builds up with evidence stacked on top of evidence. It's amazing the process needed with out computers in this period. The leg work involved, the phone calls, the devotion to seeking the truth.",All the President's Men

The Power of media and the passion of journalists can bring subversion in the politics of Superpowered state, yes it did actually. All The President's Men is very important and must be acknowledged thing for every American and to some extent to the rest of the world if they are interested. What do we expect from One Film? Fine actors, great writing, brilliant direction and Classic cinematic experience, right? Well, here's is your complete dish. All The President's has fine Acting of Robert Reford & Dustin Hoffman, it has Great writing piece from the devastating true events, it is brilliantly directed by Alan J.

All The President's Men is about famous Watergate Scandal. Two passionate reporters who are hungry for 'A Story' investigate some terrible and confidential facts to expose the Entire Governement of America. It's a tightly gripped film from the first scene, the dialogues are nothing sort of Quote thing but has natural intriguing Power. All the Actors are fine in thier particular roles, i don't need to mention Redford and Hoffman again. You know the sensitivity of the topic needed a brainy fella so that it just doesn't give away any loopholes and and may god bless Alan Pakula for leaving no stone unturned. I recently watched 'Network' which released in the same year and i found it overrated already, and compared to this one as both films are connected to Media Cosmos, Network looks even dumber than i thought.

54,imseeg,Classic seventies paranoia thriller. Masterpiece of director Alan J. Pakula. Terrific acting performances by Dustin Hofmann and Robert Redford.,10,13 September 2018,"Some movies are just perfect. This is one of them! Classic masterpiece from director Alan J. Pakula. Terrific performances by Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, who were both at the peak of their careers, bursting to life on the silver screen, with so much charisma and chemistry, that I am in awe of their true to life power in portraying these real life characters.Even after seeing it over 15 times I still don't exactly understand the intricate details of this Watergate scandal story, which was a true to life depiction of the impeachment of President Nixon of the United States. But the Watergate story is a gigantic suspenseful maze that is thrilling from beginning to end, therefore it doesn't really matter when one doesn't understand some of the intricacies of the plot, because the gripping level of suspense and paranoia is what makes ""All the President's Men"" such a great movie. I have even seen it when I was a little kid and I obviously didn't understand the politics of the Watergate story, but I was deeply impressed by the intensity of the continuous suspense nonetheless.Mostly containing of nothing else but dialogues. No action. It is just one continuous search quest by 2 news reporters, with many newspaper board meetings, but still I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to the very end, because of a continuous level of suspense Hitchcock would be jealous of.Filmed by photographer Gordon Willis (The Godfather), who is known as the Master of Darkness, because of his excellent low light photography. Shot in a documentary style sort of photography that was very popular among many other famous paranoia thrillers of the seventies like ""The Marathon Man"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", ""The Parallax View"" and ""The Conversation"". The images are just jaw dropping gorgeous, because of their natural free flowing camera movements.The soundtrack, which has won an Oscar, oozes paranoia and is very subtle yet creepy. 3 more Oscars were awarded to All The President's Men in 1976.This is one heck of a classic. I just cant find anything wrong with this movie. I get impressed by it every single time I see it. A must watch for all those movie fans, who love to watch one of the many brilliant seventies American cinematic masterpieces.",All the President's Men
55,jzappa,The Subtle Difference Between Gunshots and Typewriter Keys,10,18 May 2011,"All the President's Men is an action film. But it's comprised not of speeding cars, bombs, fists, gadgets, guns, but of names, dates, phones, happenstance, false leads, relentless footwork, denials, and, like a would-be usual villainous mastermind whose henchmen doggedly protect him, the truth. Just such particulars brought about Watergate and Nixon's resignation, but the movie's more about facts than consequences. It's as precise about the procedures used by investigative reporters as we have any entitlement to require from a movie.Hustling by like a whirlwind at a somewhat sprawling 138 minutes, All the President's Men could stagger a laid-back viewer as easily as astound a researcher doing a frame-by-frame breakdown. It has a faster pulse, tighter tension than any other newspaper movie I can think of, including His Girl Friday, the ones that always exaggerate the exhilaration and discount the tedium and waiting. This one's all about those and the vigorous excavating. It relies on what we already understand about Watergate to supply thrill, yet given that William Goldman's screenplay is virtually all dialogue, director Alan J. Pakula has achieved extraordinary success at keeping snaredrum tension.Who would've thought you could mount such suspense with Bernstein approaching Woodward's desk and eavesdropping on the extension phone? And the movie's so well acted, shot and paced that it expands the drive and energy even in the scenes where Woodward and Bernstein are getting doors shut in their faces. Maybe even especially! The sound throbs, with its suggestive bonding of typewriter keys. The cutting is shrewdly subtle, with its persistent long takes that simply make us sit and fester. Once, we from a wide shot to a medium shot of an interviewee. We've leapt forward as though leaning in to hear, because we, like the reporters, are extremely eager to listen.Collaborating for the third time with Pakula, Gordon Willis memorably flaunts his signature darks in the presentation of Deep Throat, spying an indistinguishable figure hidden in the shadows until he lights a cigarette, the match burning momentarily in a pond of dense black. But unexpectedly, he compellingly uses vivid lights. The Washington Post offices are seen with granular white lighting that throws no shadows, leaves the lines of workspace and typewriters like a shelter of familiarity in a world of dim, treacherous corners.The astonishing, mesmerizing world-class shot that begins as an extreme close-up of library reference cards and slowly widens up, and up, and up, and up, and up, not only dwarfing the cards but making insects out of the human characters, is the most powerful possible statement of the blood, sweat and tears that went into their investigation. Pakula and Willis are with both hyperbole and deadpan grace suggesting that they have to sift through enough cards to fill this whole enormous spectacle of a wide shot, or to at least match it in gall and determination, to rival the enormous power they're up against, which is what is constantly being augmented by the incredibly wide framing.This is cinema's most sharp-eyed survey of working journalists we're ever apt to see. Woodward and Bernstein shall in the end supplant Hildy and Walter as vocation prototypes, thriving exceptionally in implying the fusion of excitement, obsession, self-doubt, and nerve that flooded the Post as they aimed at a presidency. When Robert Redford revealed that he'd acquired the rights to the book, the newsroom gag was about reporters turning into movie stars. It ended up vice versa. Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein drill through their characters and become completely realistic. There's not a put-on or ""Hollywood"" footnote in the entire film.Pakula doesn't brood over the personal lives of the characters, but he has a fastidious feel for their professional lives, particularly with their relationships with editors. The Watergate story began as a local story, not a national one. Woodward was Protestant, Bernstein a Jew. Woodward was a Republican, Bernstein a Liberal Democrat. Woodward was an extremely didactic journalist, Bernstein had a jittery impatience. But they had to work together, be professional, objective.We meet the metro editor, Jack Warden's Rosenfeld, protecting and pestering ""Woodstein"" as the dynamic duo came to be recognized. Martin Balsam plays Simons, the managing editor, and Jason Robards is Bradlee, the executive editor. All three are perfect. They've learned the exact pitch, they carry on a news meeting like they've held one before, and they even demonstrate characteristic office ways: If you've covered a daily beat, you're entitled to slacken your tie and wear saggy pants.The movie has dozens of minor character roles for all the people who spoke to Woodstein, or declined to. Some of the other roles have a propensity for merging into one mysterious Source, but Robert Walden makes an unforgettable Donald Segretti, the dirty-tricks specialist veiling anguish with bluster. And two crucial informers are played in fascinatingly diverse ways. Jane Alexander is a bookkeeper who gives the team some of their best leads. She's readily understood, frank, nervous. Hal Holbrook, as the mystifying Deep Throat, the source within the administration, is distressingly aloof, practically like he's viewing the proceedings with a vain snicker.There must've been lure to expand upon Woodward and Bernstein, alter the rhythm with subplots about their personal lives, but, like all good action-adventures, the film sticks resolutely to the chase, starting with an apparently minor break-in and following it, almost disbelievingly sometimes, as it ultimately runs all the way up the ladder. The energy of Watergate seems to thrust Woodward and Bernstein, rather than vice versa, just as the ticking bomb or the hostages in the skyscraper do John McClaine or James Bond.",All the President's Men
56,thinker1691,""" There is no greater weapon in a democracy, than a free press """,7,23 March 2009,"On June 17th, 1972 a security guard (Frank Willis) discovered a small piece of tape covering the latch on the basement door of the Headquarters of the National Democratic Committee in Florida. Calling for the police, they quickly arrested five well dressed burglars, one with $800 in his wallet. What few people knew was that these individuals would become the foundation of a massive conspiracy which involved the entire Federal community including the F.B.I, C.I.A. and other agencies working for the President of the United States. Attending the burglars at their court arraignment, rookie reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) is astounded to learn one of the burglar's previously worked for the C.I.A. in the White House. The senior reporter who is later paired with him is 14 year veteran Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman). What transpires in the next three years will illuminate the secret illegal activities, covert operations and deep paranoia of the Nixon Administration. In this movie, audiences are privy to the workings of The Washington Post and the enormous efforts of these two Pulitzer Prize winning journalists. Jack Warden plays Harry M. Rosenfeld the Metroploitan editor who despite his own doubts believes in the future of the promising investigative journalists. Martin Balsam is Howard Simons and Jason Robards plays stanch Ben Bradlee, the Executive Editor of the Post. Even though they realized the risks involved, they stood their ground and allow the citizens of America to see the importance of a free press. In retrospect, America also learns of the immense risk and hazardous undertaking assumed by Woodward's 'invisible' source by the then Assistant Director of the F.B.I. 'Mark Felt' who has come to be known as ""Deep Throat."" (Hal Holbrook) With his invaluable help, Americas' press reveals how even a man so powerful as a sitting President must not be allowed to believe he is above the law.

57,ackstasis,"""It leads everywhere. Get out your notebook. There's more.""",8,16 February 2007,"To be completely honest, coming into this film, I knew extremely little about the Watergate scandal, beyond knowing that Forrest Gump was responsible for the burglaries being discovered, because the flashlights were ""keeping him awake."" On June 17 1972, a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C., by members of the Richard Nixon administration, resulted in a string of cover-ups and, ultimately, in Nixon's 1974 resignation. The two Washington Post journalists credited with uncovering the Watergate scandal are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, later known collectively as ""Woodstein."" Their exploits are detailed in their 1974 non-fiction book, 'All The President's Men,' from which this film of the same name was adapted.The scandal itself arose from humble beginnings. When a low-key court hearing for the five Watergate burglars piques the interest of Bob Woodward (Robert Redford), he and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) are assigned to the story. At the time, it is deemed insignificant enough to involve these two secondary journalists, but Woodward and Bernstein soon discover that the scandal runs higher than they could ever have anticipated.Redford and Hoffman are great in their respective roles, seamlessly stepping into the shoes of two reporters and never for a moment slipping up. Strong supporting roles also come from Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Jason Robards as editors of the Washington Post, and they act their respective roles convincingly, as though they've been in the newspaper business their whole lives. Hal Holbrook is suitably mysterious as Deep Throat, Woodward's anonymous inside source, who arranges meetings in the eerie shadows of a deserted parking garage. Deep Throat's true identity was kept a secret until May 31 2005, when William Mark Felt, Sr stepped forward and publicly revealed the truth.It would, no doubt, have been tempting for the filmmakers to exaggerate or overdramatise the two reporters' exploits, perhaps by ""fleshing out"" their characters by including their own troubling personal lives, or by throwing in a random car chase to get the adrenaline pumping. However, director Alan J. Pakula and screenwriter William Goldman have remained relatively loyal to the source material, and manage somehow keep a taut storytelling pace, despite the film consisting largely of inquiring phone calls and interviews with reluctant sources.This is a stunning political thriller, the greatest triumph arising from the film's ability to keep the audience's attention, despite everybody already knowing how the story is going to end. Well, except for me",All the President's Men

The outcome of the story is of course no mystery, but director Alan J. Pakula and writer William Goldman cleverly used this to their advantage. All the familiar villains are kept off-screen (except for TV images and voices over the phone) as the growing scandal is gradually revealed by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, building layer upon layer of deceit and paranoia following what first appears to be a routine investigation of an unsuccessful burglary. From the often confusing chronology and characters the filmmakers were able, without altering the facts, to extract a coherent, swiftly plotted drama, in the process creating a modern political Film Noir that works better than most fictitious examples of the genre.",All the President's Men

61,jimbo-53-186511,Interesting and also a fairly important part of American History,7,5 April 2015,"All The President's Men is a film adaptation of the true story of The Watergate Scandal that took place in the early 70's. It begins with a break-in at the Democratic Party's National Headquarters which Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) are assigned to investigate. However, this proves to be far from any run of the mill report and their findings eventually lead them all the way up to The White House.As mentioned, this is an adaptation of a book which was written by Bernstein and Woodward and the screenplay has been adapted by William Goldman. I myself was born after The Watergate Scandal so I don't have first-hand knowledge of the event. I also haven't read the book so my comments can only be confined to this film and Goldman's screenplay and for me I found it worked really well.Following the break-in, the investigation begins pretty much straight away and what I really liked about this film is that it pretty much sticks with Bernstein & Woodward's investigation from start to finish - there were no silly sub-plots and the film never seemed to have any pointless deviations. The clever part about this film is not how it ends (anyone who lived during the scandal or who has read the plot summary will know how it ends), but in how it's unravelled. I must say that I found it all very interesting and enjoyed the way that Bernstein and Woodward piece everything together. I also quite like the fact that the film included stock-footage during the actual Watergate Scandal. The plot unravels itself at a slow pace, but it's never boring and therefore if you're a patient viewer then there is certainly a lot to enjoy here. Another selling point in this film is that you have two great actors such as Hoffman & Redford in the lead roles and both actors play off each other and work really well together.All The President's Men isn't the most exciting film ever made and it's unlikely to have you on the edge of your seat. However, it is an historically important film depicting real life events and is also a very interesting film which I found to be thoroughly enjoyable. The only real negative I could find with this film is that it's perhaps a little too long at nearly 140 minutes. If you're interested in American History then this is well worth a look. Although casual viewers should enjoy this too.",All the President's Men

63,EUyeshima,Proof Positive That Truth Is More Compelling Than Fiction,9,9 March 2006,"It is amazing how compulsively watchable this 1976 non-fiction political thriller is given we already know the outcome and how the two Washington Post reporters spotlighted, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, thrived afterward. What is even more impressive now versus three decades ago is how dramatically resonant the labyrinth plot is relative to what is being reported on the current administration. Having just read Bruce Bartlett's ""Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy"", the author draws strong, irrefutable analogies between Bush and Nixon. Now having watched this superbly rendered historic film, the parallels are almost eerie in how the plot developments foreshadow the clandestine activities highlighted in a bevy of contemporary political books including Bartlett's.Based on the 1974 book written by Woodward and Bernstein, the movie follows the two ambitious, unproven reporters from their breaking coverage of the Watergate break-in to the final headline on the AP wire of Nixon's resignation. Unsurprisingly, all this is done without the direct involvement of the incriminated officials, yet their off-screen presence casts a vast, impenetrable shadow on the investigation covered. The result is a suspenseful storyline that winds tighter and tighter as new evidence comes to light and the evasive participants come forward in the most elliptical manner. The cast is terrific but secondary to the intricacy of William Goldman's compelling screenplay and the documentary-style realism of the setting all masterfully directed by Alan J. Pakula. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play ""Wood-stein"" convincingly and for the most part unobtrusively, though Hoffman's naturally manic personality seeps out periodically and for good reason. Jason Robards plays Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee with his trademark authority as he begrudgingly moves forward in supporting the boys.Stalwart character actors Jack Warden and Martin Balsam play the other key figures in the press room giving the green light to the increasingly controversial news stories. In lesser roles and cameos, Pakula populates the film with a number of familiar faces from TV and movies - Ned Beatty, Hal Holbrook, Stephen Collins, John McMartin, Penny Fuller, Meredith Baxter, Neva Patterson, Polly Holliday - and they all register one way or the other. The standout is Jane Alexander as a fearful accountant working on the staff of the Nixon re-election committee - in just two brief scenes, she skillfully alternates between stonewalling, cowering and divulging in front of the intrepid reporters with ebbing fury. Through the course of the film, names from the past - Haldeman, Liddy, Hunt, Mitchell, Magruder, Segretti - come back with their infamy intact, as the covert CIA operations threaten to rock the Nixon administration beyond repair. Truth be told, unless you have a familiarity with the Watergate scandal, you will be swimming in the plethora of facts presented, but the propulsive pacing more than compensates for such presumptions.Now in a 30th anniversary two-disc set, the movie has been justifiably revitalized for a new generation with some wonderful extras. Redford's commentary is first-rate - illuminating from his perspective as both actor and producer. There is a Holbrook-narrated documentary, ""Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of All the President's Men"", on the book-to-film transition, and another short about the impact of Woodward and Bernstein's legacy on present-day investigative reporting (though no mention of Woodward's current controversy in withholding information in the Plame scandal). There is an invaluable profile on W. Mark Felt, the FBI's then-second-in-command who has been disclosed as the real ""Deep Throat"". A 1976 making-of featurette has been included as well.",All the President's Men
64,valleyjohn,Confusing at times but some great performances,8,30 October 2021,"I can't believe it's taken me this long to get around to seeing All the presidents men . A film that comes up in my polls so often .Did it live up to the hype ? Well , yes and no .This is the enactment of the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein who uncovered the dirty tricks campaign and the coverup of the White House's involvement in the Watergate break in. The stories they wrote were very instrumental in the eventual resignation of President Richard Nixon.Firstly I'll say what I liked about it .It feels incredibly real. Even like a documentary at times . The meetings of the editors of The Washington Post and their dialogue is extremely realistic.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are great too. They actually learned each other's lines so they could interrupt each other during the filming and it works remarkably well.I also love the scenes in the newspaper building .The use of pen and paper and typewriters is fascinating and it's ridiculous how they typed everything correctly first time.The downside to the film is the complexity of the story .It is hard to follow but I think that's down to the fact that Woodward and Bernstein were trying to work out what was happening as well and the lack of information they were getting from the people involved .I must admit I'm still confused as to the what really happened but does that really matter ?Yes , in my opinion and because of it not being very clear ( perhaps it's just me?)

By now I realized my thoughts didn't make any sense, because we must look at our past to understand the present, and even more to get the future. Movies like 'Nuit et Brouillard' aren't made for fun (maybe some sadists will say I'm wrong, but I'm not one of them). They are made for the future. For example: I wasn't born yet when the Watergate Scandal occurred. Thanks to this fantastic film, I now can learn about it and form my own thoughts about it. And it's true, the suspense was killing me. The ending comes so suddenly, I was hoping for a good ending. Is it a good ending? Ask that question yourself. Only two minutes before the final frame of this epic journalist movie, was it made clear that happened what had to happen. Let's hope and pray that in the future someday some guy is going to say he'll make a movie about our present politics. Then we'll see in the future of the present the past of today.",All the President's Men

It's topic and theme are rousing. But it's two and a quarter hour running time suggests too much self-regard. It has nothing going for it in terms of filmic ideas. It's just a narrative. It kind of toys with some tension-building cross-cuts borrowed from The Manchurian Candidate; political progress is being made by the incorrigible as the truth is ferreted out. But the movie really fails to convey the exciting, outraged hub-bub of scandalized American population watching the trickle of these developments. Viewers who admire this prefer clear moral lines, and are pleased by journalists portrayed as knights in shining armor. But we've seen despicable journalists using the media for evil only too recently. It was a short trip from The Pentagon Papers to Judith Miller, Robert Novak, Fox News; and other sub-human individuals willing to foist partisan PR on the nation, as a smoke screen to advance personal causes.Almost 4 decades of GOP underhandedness began here with Karl Rove waiting in the wings. And Ford's complicity and inability to recognize the crimes, created an urge in the GOP to do it all over again, only at a more grotesque scale, which was realized with the Bush/Cheney Whitehouse.",All the President's Men
67,Galina_movie_fan,"Great, simply great",10,7 July 2005,"That's what a political thriller should be  suspenseful, gripping, dynamic, keeping a viewer riveted to the screen for all 138 minutes of its duration even though we know the story very well  its beginning and its inevitable conclusion. That's a great, inspired movie-making from everyone involved. Robert Redford who also produced the film bought the screen rights to Bob Woodward (whom he played) and Carl Bernstein's (Dustin Hoffman) book on the exposure of Watergate conspiracy for $225, 000. Oscar winning screenwriter William Goldman wrote a great screenplay and persuaded Hoffman to play Bernstein. Special mention should go to Alan Pakula whose quiet, masterful and intelligent directing delivered the suspense that the story demands. ""All The President's Men"" is Pakula's final chapter in what is known as ""paranoia trilogy"" that also includes ""Klute"" (1971) and ""The Parallax View"" (1974).

For me, the film is rarely gripping but is still interesting all the same. The director - Alan J. Pakula - made a far superior political thriller with ""The Parallax View"" from 1974. That is a truly memorable film. The cast in ""All the President's Men"" is exceptional. Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford are well cast but they are given excellent support by the likes of Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jason Robards Jnr, Hal Halbrooks and others. The kind of dialogue that this film has, makes the whole film rather talky. This disappoints me slightly as I was hoping for some incident.

69,eric262003,Excellent Coverage of the Watergate Scandal,9,1 February 2015,"Based on the bestselling novel from veteran journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, ""All the President's Men"" was directed with absolute care by director Alan Pakula and a very intelligent script by William Goldman, this movie set standards that are almost to near impossible. Not only was this multidimensional Oscar winning film exposes the happenings of the Watergate Scandal, it also focuses on the goings on behind the scenes of newspaper writing. What made this movie stand out above the rest was that it refrained from falsifying any kind of Hollywood clichés or overly pandering on the two leading performers who were pretty hot at the times (Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford). This is a very conventional film that succeeds in keeping it real to the point that has the feel like a documentary which adds tension to every scene that's featured. There was never any doubt that stuff like this couldn't happen because everything happened felt like it did. We could relate to them when at times our two reporters are put in a precarious situation and just can't get out of it at times. Even during their failures, we can reflect upon them as they deserve our sympathy the whole way through. Back in the 1970's, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) was still a relatively new criminal journalist for the Washington Post who was assigned to break into the Watergate Office Building. Veteran reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) but his bravado has seen better days. Woodward was very vocal about his Republican beliefs, while Bernstein was very strong about his Democratic agenda which leads to the duo to question whether they should work together to disclose President Nixon and the Watergate Scandal. Through their political beliefs, they got along worse than two roosters in a coop. At first Redford and Hoffman were not the first choices to play the roles of these two ace reporters, but it was Warner Brothers recommended Redford to play the part of Woodward, due to him being a hot commodity at the time. While at a New York Knicks games, Redford spotted Hoffman and recommended he'd play the role of Carl Bernstein. Hoffman and Redford were backed up by a strong pool of supporting actors including Oscar winning performer Jason Robards as the managing editor of the Washington Post Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden as newspaper editor Harry M. Rosenfeld and Martin Balsam as the Post's managing editor Howard Simons. Hal Holbrook adds great mysticism as the shadowy figure who's the source for leaking information known only as ""Deep Throat"". This is quite a heavy initiative at the time since no one knew anything about this man at the time (it was later revealed to be FBI Agent Mark Felt). The technical features and the settings add merit to this very well executed film. Cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a stressful atmosphere towards our two disgruntled reporters as they draw nearer to unravelling secrets behind the Watergate Scandal. And while production designers George Jenkins and George Gaines recreated a believable newsroom while situating it on a Warner sound-stage.The film looks into the the revealing of E. Howard Hunt's phone number the robbers who tried to break into the Democratic National Commitee in possession of the slush funds that was under operation of the Committee to Reelect the President (CREEP) that funded political sabotage and from there Woodward and Bernstein try to puzzle that link that leads to one H.R. Haldeman. We follow our reporters as they gather one tidbit of information to the next trying to get something out of their stressful investigating. Many people who have pursued their careers in journalism must have seen this movie, but it makes you wonder, how many of those students understand the complexity of the story? Do they see the painful restless search for the truth can be a very tiring task and trying to finalize each fact, or do they only see this movie of two ace journalists who made it big by uncovering the biggest scandal in American history and became famous and successful after that? The Watergate Scandal was a primary example of a red-handed ""gotcha"" style of journalism that still lingers on forty years later, but Woodward and Bernstein who were famous for uncovering the Watergate Scandal aren't the kind of journalists who do that kind of work. The whole Scandal just fell into the wrong hands at the wrong time.",All the President's Men
70,denis888,Extremely Powerful Movie,10,10 March 2018,"If we take Nixon of 1995, last years's The Post and 1976's All the President's Men, we will get a powerful trio of totally different but still mightily similar powerful movies which all describe the same time, the same era much to the same great effect. Here, in All the President's Men we see very similar pacing and setting as in The Post, which in fact is a wonderful prequel, but the focus is on two great real living journalists, Dustin Hoffman as 
Carl Bernstein and Robert Redford as Bob Woodward - and this duo possesses an admirably strong and amicably cute chemistry with a smashing effect.
This film is already a classic of serious, slow-pacing, menacingly slow, dark brooding matter and utter grandeur.

A knowledge of the events is helpful but not necessary to the enjoyment of the movie but if you pay attention all the information is there. Great performances from the entire cast down to the smallest roles. Redford and Hoffman work brilliantly together and retain your interest in the procedure of the investigation. Jane Alexander makes a strong impression in her two scenes as a careworn reluctant informant, good enough to score her a best supporting actress nomination. The other two real standouts are Jason Robards Jr. as Ben Bradlee, showing him to be a tough but honest and courageous man who is willing to buck popular opinion and stand behind his reporters for the greater good, and Hal Holbrook wonderfully icy as Deep Throat. A fascinating film terrifically directed by Pakula.",All the President's Men
72,DeeNine-2,The Watergate scandal from the reporters' perspective,8,30 September 2003,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This dramatization of how it was discovered that the burglary of the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D. C. was funded and directed by the Nixon White House is a lot better than it has any right to be. Given the tedious, non-glamorous and frankly boring leg- and phone-work that is often the lot of the investigative reporter, it is surprising that this is a very interesting movie even if you don't care two beans about the Watergate scandal. In fact, this is really more about how the story was put together than it is about the scandal itself. It is also a lot less political than might be expected. It stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and they are good, with excellent support from Jason Robards (Oscar as Best Supporting Actor) playing Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee, and Jane Alexander as an innocent caught up in the machinations. But what makes the movie work is the Oscar-winning script adapted from the Woodward and Bernstein best seller by that old Hollywood pro, William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969, Misery 1990, etc.). What he does so very well, even though we know the outcome, is to establish and maintain the tension as Woodward and Bernstein run all over town chasing leads and misdirections. He accomplishes this by putting just enough varied obstacles in the path of our intrepid reporters, notably the Washington bureaucracy and the understandably cautious senior editors at the Post.The direction by Alan J. Pakula (Comes a Horseman 1978, Sophie's Choice 1982, etc.) focuses the scenes nicely, keeps the camera where it belongs, and highlights the story with a shadowy Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook), skitterish sources, and a vivid recreation of a top American newspaper at work. I was especially enthralled to see the interactions among the reporters, the editors and the sources. I thought they all looked and sounded authentic, Redford's good looks having nothing to do with the story, which was right, and Hoffman's flair for the intense reigned in, which was necessary. The diffidence of Alexander's character and the soft pushiness of Woodward and Bernstein were tempered just right. Bradlee's stewardship of the story and his ability to take a calculated risk seemed true to life.Some details that stood out: Redford's hunt and peck typing contrasted with Hoffman's all fingers flying; the talking heads on the strategically placed TVs, reacting (via actual video footage) to the developing story--deny, deny, deny! of course. The thin reporter's spiral notebooks being pulled out and then later flipped through to find a quote. The bright lights of the newsroom looking expansive with all those desks as though there were mirrors on the walls extending an illusion. The seemingly silly tricks to get a source to confirm: just nod your head; I'll count to ten and if you're still on the line... And you know what I liked best? No annoying subplot!The rather abrupt resolution with the teletype banging out the leads to a sequence of stories that led to President Nixon's resignation had just the right feel to it, especially for those of us who have actually experienced the goosepimply sensation that comes with watching a breaking story come in over the teletype. The quick wrap-up surprised me, but delighted me at the same time. Bottom line: an excellent movie that wears well, a fine example of some of Hollywood's top professionals at work some thirty years ago. #30",All the President's Men
73,sme_no_densetsu,Woodward and Bernstein follow the money in 'the most devastating detective story of the century',8,27 July 2014,"On paper, ""All the President's Men"" is a movie that shouldn't have worked. The Watergate scandal reached its apex only a couple of years earlier and you'd have to be living under a rock to not know what the outcome was. Turning to a highly familiar news story for subject matter isn't that unusual but when that story revolves around a couple of newspaper reporters going around asking people questions, the opportunities for drama would appear to be minimal. And yet, somehow, Alan J. Pakula took this story and fashioned it into one of the best political thrillers of all time.William Goldman's Oscar-winning script (based on the book by Woodward & Bernstein) deserves a fair share of the credit. Although the source material is quite interesting, turning it into a gripping cinematic experience took considerable skill. My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit awkwardly handled (not that I can see how it could have been improved upon).Another strong point of the film is the acting. The two leads, Robert Redford & Dustin Hoffman, both contributed fine work as reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, respectively. They received strong support from several actors, including Jason Robards, who won an Oscar for his efforts. Other notables include Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jane Alexander and Hal Holbrook.The direction demonstrates Pakula's skill and relies more on subtle touches than outright flourishes. The cinematography by 'Prince of Darkness' Gordon Willis is superb, though it was bafflingly snubbed by Oscar voters. Another unsung technical element was the moody score by David Shire. The film did manage to snag Oscars for art direction-set decoration and sound, though.Overall, ""All the President's Men"" deserves praise for presenting a familiar story with both artistry and entertainment value. Regardless of how much you already know about the Watergate scandal, this movie makes for compelling viewing from beginning to end.",All the President's Men
74,dunmore_ego,Fall of the Imperial Presidency.,8,3 January 2010,"Watergate. Conspiracy. Burglary. Perjury. Courtesy of the 37th President of the United States.Over the years, I've called Richard Milhous Nixon a ""hellspawn from Satan's own vagina"" and I see no reason to stop.ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a powerful recount of specifically one event in Satan's Vagina's presidency that would define not just his wretched life and character, but ultimately the Republican presidential idiom - the Watergate Scandal.Dick Cheney must hate this film. This is the tale of how that imperial presidency he has tried all his life to restore was lopped off at the knees. The story of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN was the catalyst that created the cowardly thug Dick Cheney.The 1972 exposés from the pages of the Washington Post newspaper (by young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein) are breathed life on the big screen by screenwriter William Goldman and director Alan J. Pakula. Full credit to Pakula for making a dry political felony play like a mystery thriller, as Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) research the story behind the Watergate Hotel break-in by some of the president's men, tracing it up the withered tree of liberty to the Oval Egg itself, indicting ALL the president's men.As Woodward and Bernstein knock on doors, make endless phone calls, meet, trick, cajole people to verify sources and information, we get lost sometimes amongst all the felons, because there are so many; this is real life and it is not a case of one Batman Villain and a coterie of faceless henchmen - each of the unethical, amoral, interconnected criminals contributed equally to the collusion and conspiracy that led to the burglary and illegal wiretapping of the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in 1972. Even when reading the book (of the same name, by Woodward and Bernstein), you find yourself always turning to the Dramatis Personae to discern the players and their involvement - a bit like LORD OF THE RINGS, except in this drama, the evil characters are much more depraved, deformed and malevolent.All overlorded by Satan's Vagina.Thankfully, the filmmakers did not portray the character of Nixon in the film (a shoddy lookalike or caricatured impersonation at best, which would have diluted the film); all we see of Nixon are a few real television appearances on news footage.Set back in the day when telephones were rotary dial, when the irritating clack of typewriters had not yet been replaced by the annoying hum of word processors; back when Robert Redford's feathered hair caused women unsuspecting panty accidents; back in the day when Dick Cheney used to skulk the halls of the Nixon administration as merely a staff member (no kidding!), waiting for the day he could push the imperial presidency further than the state of abuse it had escalated to back then. (He succeeded beyond his wildest craven desires with the Ku Bush Klan 30 years later.) ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is not about the investigation of the Nixon administration, nor about the 18 minutes of blank tape, or the forced, shameful resignation of Satan's Vagina; it is not even about the hundreds of other unethical, malevolent deeds the president blast-farted onto American society (illegal Cambodia cover-up of 1970, The HMO Act of 1973) - it is about the two men who exposed the scandal that would lead to that investigation.Everything was on the line: Woodward and Bernstein's reputations, the reputation of the Post newspaper, their jobs, ultimately their lives, the freedom of the press, and the Constitution of the United States.Woodward and Bernstein's best source was the secretive informant known as Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook, eternally in darkness in the parking garage rendezvous point - thank Gordon Willis, the same cinematographer who notoriously ""lighted"" the dark, moody GODFATHER films). Which raised the eternal question: which came first, the presidential informant or the whore? Turns out there was no distinction. Linda Lovelace (DEEP THROAT, 1972) could have just as easily abrogated the duties of president and the president was overqualified to be a whore. We would learn over three decades later that Deep Throat was Mark W. Felt (revealed 2005, died 2008), the second highest officer in J. Edgar Hoover's FBI.Woodward and Bernstein worked so intently together on the Watergate scandal that their superiors took to calling them ""Woodstein.""Incredibly realistic acting makes this look like a documentary at times, from every supporting player, to the major stars at the Post: Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Jason Robards (as editor Ben Bradlee).The irony is astounding: the man who most convinced the world to retaliate against the Nazis - was Hitler himself. Just as the man most responsible for America voting a Democratic president into office in 2008 - was Republican George W. Bush! So too, the man most responsible for losing the American public's faith in high office was - the man who inhabited the highest office in America, Richard Milhous Satan's Vagina Nixon.ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN ends with Nixon being sworn in to his second term, on a television in the foreground, while in the background, Woodward and Bernstein type up the damning information which would bring down the administration and change the course of the blood red river of American politics forever.Well, at least until Dick Cheney got his stinking hands on the presidency.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",All the President's Men
75,frankde-jong,A piece of old fashioned journalism in a time of fact free social media,8,7 August 2019,"The film starts with the burglary in the Watergate building (head office of the democratic party). After this piece of action the rest of the film is all talking and dialogue. It is a miracle that director Pakula has made the film nevertheless so thrilling (given the fact that we all know how the Watergate scandal will end).The film is really about two subjects: (1) The Watergate scandal and (2) journalism as a profession.To start with the second subject. Despite the fact that the two journalist are played by the stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, they are never portrayed as hero's. Journalism is hard work with many false clue's and silent witnesses. I remember one scene in the Congress library where Woodward and Bernstein are sifting out al the requests (on paper, we are talking about the pre computer era) for books by a person they suspect. It reminded me of a library scene in ""The day of the jackall"" (1973, Fred Zinnemann) (although in that scene a contract killer is doing research on his next victim). On top of that is the ever lasting fight for the big scoop. A fight that is fought between Woodward and Bernstein (at first), between Woodstein and the rest of the eidtors of the Washington Post and last but not least between the Washington Post and the New York Times. All in all valuable to see this piece of old school journalism in times of fact free social media.After the arrest of the burglars in the Watergate building the Watergate scandal was not immediately front page news. It was more a peat fire maintained by Woodward and Bernstein. The film is about the first stage of the Watergate scandal. The period from june 1972 (the arrest) to january 1973 (inauguration from Nixon for his second term). It was not until august 1974 before Nixon would resign. In ""All the presidents men"" we learn about ""deep throat"", but we hear nothing about the White house tapes. I always asked myself the question why Nixon needed the faul play in the election of 1972. After all his opponent was George McGovern, who had really no chance (also without faul play). The reason maybe be sought in the character of Nixon (see ""Nixon"" (1995, Oliver Stone)). ""All the presidents men"" gives however a different answer. The Watergate burglary was part of a broader program of interference with the Democratic primaries. So was Edmund Muskie (an opponent who was far more dangerous to Nixon than George McGovern) discredited a few years earlier by a fake letter. The Watergate scandal and what it has to say about campaign financing is still relevant in the Trump era.Up till now I commented mainly on the content of the movie. A movie who was also beautifully made. A already said something about director Pakula (made dialogue thrilling), about the actors Redford and Hoffman (made rightfully no hero's of their characters). Let me end with saying something about cinematographer Gordon Willes, which we all know from the ""Godfathers"" movies. Gordon Willes nickname is ""Prince of darnkess"" and that made him the right person to shoot the ""deep throat scenes"".",All the President's Men

78,Cosmoeticadotcom,"Solid, if a bit dated",7,6 September 2008,"Alan J. Pakula's 1976 hit film All The President's Men is as good an example of a filmmaker as craftsman as there is. Pakula was never a great director/auteur, a man with a 'vision.' Rather, he was a journeyman filmmaker who tried to best shape whatever scripts came his way. The film is a good one, but it falls shy of greatness because it is a film that is all surface level. Yes, it digs deeply into the Watergate Conspiracy that brought down President Richard Nixon, but it never allows us to get inside its two lead protagonists, the then-unknown and now universally famed Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward (Robert Redford, who also produced the film, with Walter Coblenz) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman), who walked into the biggest journalistic story of the last fifty years. Yes, they were good, solid young reporters, but neither their writing skills nor drive was what separated them from dozens of other reporters. It was just dumb luck, or so the film portrays, for never do we get a glimpse of what makes either man tick. Yes, we get tics and obsessions, sloppiness and manic cigarette and coffee consumption, as well as posturing, but little more, and this is likely the reason that neither star was nominated for an Academy Award, although the film, itself, garnered eight of them. It won for Best Supporting Actor (Jason Robards, as Washington Post Editor Ben Bradlee), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay, by William Goldman. It also got nominations for nominated for Best Supporting Actress (Jane Alexander, as a key informant), Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Motion Picture.The downfall of Richard Nixon is so well known that to detail it, in this film's context is superfluous. This is why, however, the decision to focus on the relationship of the reporters was wise. It's the result of that focus that ultimately fails, even if the film is still suspenseful and fast moving enough to provide enough gloss to cover that narrative deficiency. Yes, we get an extraordinary glimpse into the nuts and bolts of how stories were dug at and reported in the old days, including how the Post's rivalry with the New York Times affected reporting and business decisions, before blogging and celebrity news displaced real journalism, yet there is something elegiac about the film. The book was based upon the 1974 book that the two reporters wrote, of the same title.The real stars of the film are not Redford and Hoffman, but its music editor- David Shire, film editor- Robert L. Wolfe, but most especially its cinematographer- the great Gordon Willis. The film is loaded with virtuoso work by all three, such as Willis's above the heads zoom shot out from the rotunda of the Library of Congress where Woodward and Bernstein pore over documents; other zoom outs from the men's car to shots of Washington D.C., as the men's voices banter in the voice-over background; bird's eye exterior shots of the Watergate break-in, where the light inside seems warm and orange, while from outside it is blue, dark, and threatening; the almost Stygian feel that the garage where Woodward meets Deep Throat gets, to the point that even the slightest noise augurs evil; and split screen shots that achieve the effect through naturalistic elements in the frame, rather than being imposed from without. The sound, especially in dialogue, where it overlaps, is a great example of virtuoso reality in an age when such was far more difficult to do than now. Then there are the smaller things, such as the differing looks that the two heroes of the film have versus their older, more seasoned colleagues, the almost automat feel of the recreated Washington Post newsroom, in its harsh geometric arrangements under fluorescent lighting, and other great moments, too numerous to list.Yet, despite its flaws, this film has to be considered important, and a success, as well as unfortunately relevant in light of the many current abuses of power under President George W. Bush, whose attempt at starting an Imperial Presidency after 9/11, with the consent of the majority of the American people and Congress, makes Nixon's power grab, in the face of rabid hatred for the man, seem almost quaint, if not desperate and pathetic. All The President's Men is not a great work of art, but it is a good and interesting one, as well as a cornucopia of bravura filmic techniques that artisans of the cinema should find invaluable for decades to come, almost as much as journalists and historians will find the film valuable for their own reasons. Unfortunately, the film viewer is the odd man left out in this equation. Yes, the film entertains, but as a tale it leaves one hungrier than when one started it. Oddly, this very same sort of feeling is what likely compelled its protagonists to their calling. Would that the viewer only got as just a desserts as they did.",All the President's Men
79,inspectors71,A heartbreaker for the patriots among us,10,18 March 2006,"I can't even guess how many times I've seen Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men. It never gets old, it never wears thin. This quintessential cautionary tale of political corruption just may be the best American movie ever made about a leader destroying himself with paranoia and felony.Now, whether or not it is completely historically accurate can be debated until the next milennium, but the basic story of ordinary (and less than nice) reporters stumbling on a story bigger than they can imagine and running it (and the President of the United States) to ground is inherently fascinating, the way courtroom dramas are almost unavoidably watchable. There is no gunplay here, no heaving bosoms or car chases, but the story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, lucking onto a bit of Nixonian chicanery here and there until it becomes apparent that their (and our) president is trying to cook the books with illegal contributions and political ""rat-screwing"" is flat-out riveting. If you've seen it (or you haven't and you hold an above-room-temperature-IQ), you'll find this story and its storytelling more compelling than a hundred, a thousand shootemups.Above all, it's a heartbreaking movie because, thirty-plus years later, Nixon has lost his reputation of being a monster (unless you're a raging, Moveon.org moonbat). Read enough of Nixon (especially the book about his friendship and his competition with President Kennedy by Chris Matthews) and Tricky Dick reverts back to just big ol' jowly Nixon, a human being again, and a damaged and damned one at that.Although some Democrats loved seeing Nixon brought down and some Republicans would have excused anything he did, average Americans simply looked at the president and said to themselves, ""Typical politician--a crook."" Nixon's personal failings did a tremendous injury to the nation and All the President's Men shows, masterfully, the reporter's pen, the surgeon's scalpel, if you will, cutting out the cancer Nixon created in the West Wing.When ATPM came out, two years after Nixon's resignation, the interest in seeing Nixon destroyed on screen was keen, very hateful and sadly un-American (in that, we are generally a forgiving and gentle people). Now, a third of a century after Nixon destroyed himself, viewers might not understand how angry, how deeply betrayed the American people felt. Alan Pakula has created a lasting testament to the necessity of a free press and the misery caused by a corrupted leader.Regardless of your politics, All the President's Men is a gut-wrenching must-see.",All the President's Men

It focuses almost entirely on Woodward and Bernstein of the 'Washington Post' and their early digging into the minor burglary of the offices of the Democrat National Committee that became the Watergate scandal and brought down President Richard Nixon.It is based on Woodward's book and was made only a year or so after the scandal had subsided, but 24 years on in a different political era it is still an exciting tale of two young and not very accomplished journos who, spurred on by the fear of failure as much as anything else, and not too proud to do masses of boring legwork, provoked other people, especially the law enforcement agencies, to do the job they should have done in the first place. In the film, as in real life, it's the story that counts and not personalities, and we are spared any phony love interest or much glamourisation of the two reporters. Redford and Hoffman as the two reporters were never better and the two hours twenty minutes pass very quickly.Having recently also read the autobiography of Katherine Graham, publisher and owner of the 'Post,' I realized we were seeing Jason Robards rather than the real editor of the 'Post' Ben Bradlee, a much more cultivated character. However the film does reflect the general support the senior executives gave to 'Woodstein,' as Bradlee called them, despite the risks involved. Former Attorney-General John Mitchell's famous sinister remark about Katy Graham getting her tits caught in the mangle is heard and the Bradlee of the film makes a brief reference to being put under a lot of pressure by the story, but not mentioned is the strong evidence that the Nixon administration tried to damage the Washington Post Company by taking away its TV licenses. Graham had to think of her employees even if she was sanguine about losing some of her personal wealth. The United States is fortunate that a few of its major newspapers have private owners who believe they have a duty to inform the public as well as to make money. One wonders what Bradlee would have been forced to do if Rupert Murdoch had owned the 'Post'. Graham explains that casting her as a character was discussed and some interesting casting suggestions made, but eventually she decided it was better for her to stay out of it.Nearly 25 years later we still don't know the identity of 'Deep Throat', Woodward's furtive informer. Hal Holbrook, who plays the part as a prototype of the 'X Files' cancer man, has played several U S presidents but I think we can be sure that 'Deep Throat' was not Richard Nixon.June 2005 postscript. Now we do know that Deep Throat was the Deputy Director of the FBI, Mark Felt. Despite all the cigarettes, Mr Felt is, at 91, alive and reasonably well and living in Los Angeles. The surviving Nixon aides call him a traitor. In that case we need more like him!",All the President's Men
82,classicalsteve,Political Scandal of the 20th Century that is Better than Fiction,10,13 August 2007,"A break-in and bugging at the headquarters of a major political party gone awry. Two green reporters assigned to cover the story. A nameless informant willing only to meet in a parking garage and goes by the code name ""Deep Throat"". A hot-headed but fair editor of a major newspaper. And in the background looms the President of the United States. It's hard to believe that this is not the plot and characters of a fiction bestseller by the likes of John Grisham or James Patterson. Instead, this is the true story of one of the strangest moments in American political theater that almost reads like the latest suspense novel.President Nixon consented to give his merry band of political operatives, aka Bob Haldeman, John Mitchell, John Erlichman, and Charles Colson, the go-ahead to engage in a systematic endeavor to either discredit and/or destroy not only the political futures of rivals but also any adversaries who propagated a point of view contrary to the president. Certainly there were previous moments in presidential history where this had occurred, such as FDR's confiscation of IRS records to cripple opponents. But the operatives, at first called ""the plumbers"" to plug leaks to the press, created a conspiratorial and secret infrastructure where campaign money financed preconceived tactics that included such diverse ploys as spreading false rumors about political candidates, stealing medical records, and blowing up an office building. Ironically, part of the operation became known as C.R.E.E.P. (the Committee for the Reelection of the President).And it almost worked, until the conspirators became too arrogant and decided to break into and plant bugging devices in the National Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Office complex in Washington DC. The five men hired for the crime were caught by undercover agents before they could make their escape. The blunder of the five men at the Watergate headquarters was the first glimpse into the politically-motivated operations that garnered attention from the press and would later prove to be the so-called ""tip of the iceberg"".""All the President's Men"" chronicles how two relatively green Washington Post reporters, Carl Bernstien (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) covered the Watergate break-in story and began to uncover strange bits and pieces about the much larger conspiracy. A White House attorney is sent to the courthouse during the arraignment of the five burglars. The burglars appear to have had in their possession at the time of the break-in large sums of money that lead to campaign contributions in other states. And when Woodward confronts his secret informant code named ""Deep Throat"" he realizes he is onto something much larger than the break-in when the informant tells him to ""Follow the money."" which has become one of the most famous or infamous lines in political history.The film is an absolute masterpiece of movie-making with top-notch performances by all, particularly with Jason Robards as the chief editor of the Post Ben Bradley and Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat. The pacing is right on the money, so-to-speak, with all the twists and turns you might find from the latest political thriller on the bestseller list. And yet you have to keep reminding yourself that this is not a fiction; this film chronicles the eventual exposure of shameful and appalling acts that took place upon our political landscape. These acts benefited absolutely no one and brought down a president.",All the President's Men

In a cool fashion the film follows the reporters step by step as they uncovered the scandal and for once doesn't sugarcoat the lead characters as the mercilessly turned over every stone imaginable to progress in their investigations.Robert Redford and especially Dustin Hoffman are credible as Woodward and Bernstein, Jason Robards is fantastic as their editor. The script, based on the reporters book, is overflowing with information but the entire proceedings are so well handled by Alan J.

I was maybe 19, dumb as dirt and easily fooled by whatever the news told me. How could they be bias, it's not like they had $90,000 locked in some freezer somewhere. Once I grew up, researched some and observed lefties – I learned to question everything out of Hollywood. Hoffman and Redford did super jobs riding this political-hack vehicle off the bridge of over-acting – ran away, while leaving the truth to drown in a cold, lonely and watery grave. This story was an obvious pant-load of lies, with only a hint of fact. A couple of grand-standing reporters, backed by an arrogant star (The Truth About Lies) were full of themselves, and orchestrated this, 'ends-justifies-the-means' story just because their team wasn't in office. I am still amazed how some people will eat garbage-crisps like this and moan, 'I believe – I BELIEVE!!!'",All the President's Men
85,TOMASBBloodhound,The power of the pen.,8,30 November 2005,"All the President's Men was both a commercially and critically successful film which chronicled the investigation of the Nixon administration by two zealous young reporters. Woodward and Bernstein are still household names to this day, and Redford and Hoffman are sensational as them. The film throws a blizzard of names and dates at the audience, so the film may require more than one viewing to understand it all.The film begins with some stock footage of Nixon addressing Congress then we see five hired thugs break into the Democratic headquarters in the now famous Watergate Hotel. Redford (playing Woodward) is assigned to cover the story after the men are arrested, and almost immediately he notices some odd things about the men, and how they are being represented. He and Hoffman (Bernstein) are soon digging up anything they can find and piecing together any available leads to build a story implicating members of the Nixon administration. Over the course of the film, the reporters learn that a large slush fund of money sent in to re-elect Nixon has been parceled out to pay for various dastardly deeds. It looks like virtually everyone in the administration had something to do with it. As we all know, this investigation ultimately led to Nixon's resignation.Redford is particularly outstanding in this film. He also produced it, so you knew he'd come out looking pretty good. Hoffman is terrific as always, and the supporting cast is truly amazing. This film even got Martin Balsam and Jack Warden from 12 Angry Men in the same room once again! Hal Holbrook plays the infamous ""Deep Throat"" whose identity was recently learned by all. The film is pretty much all dialog, and most of it is fascinating. I loved the scenes with Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee where he as the editor evaluates whether or not the story is good enough. It must have truly been an exciting experience to work at a newspaper, especially back in those days when people under 60 actually read them.The movie looks a little to dark and grainy for my taste. I've only seen it once on DVD, and it looks a little better, but old VHS copies look pretty murky. There are also a few too many names thrown around that we don't necessarily need to hear about. Those would be my only beefs, though.The Watergate scandal, and the resulting resignation of President Nixon is still considered by many to be the crowning achievement of print journalism. In some ways you could call it the last victory of the Old Media. Nowadays, blogs and the internet have changed the way journalism happens. Consider the way in which the public learned about Monica Lewinsky's semen-stained dress via the Drudge Report. The means of journalism may have changed, but one thing will never change. Politicians will always be untrustworthy, and every new day is the chance for a new scandal.8 of 10 stars.The Hound has spoken.",All the President's Men

87,gab-14712,The Watergate Scandal Re-telling,8,18 October 2017,"Let me tell you readers something about newspaper movies. They are generally about the excitement of the events that is occurring, but seldom do these kind of movies allow the audience to know that the majority of retrieving information is dull and tedious. In 1976's All the President's Men, that is exactly what it's all about. This is a newspaper movie that takes you through the finer points of the newspaper business accurately as possible with very little action and mostly dialogue. I see that as a good thingand a bad thing. See, there are some movies that should be accurate as possible and this is one of them. This movie is about how the Washington Post uncovered the Watergate Scandal and accuracy is about the best you'll see in any film. But does that sacrifice the entertainment value of the movie? It depends on the moviegoer you are. If you like movie with lots of exposition, then you'll have no problem. I think it also depends on your historical knowledge of the film and the more you know, the more interesting it can be. That being said, the movie has a reputation of being one of 1976's finest films. I may not think so, although I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The story lends some historical value and it can grow tense at times. This film needs strong acting and it received excellent performances from everyone down to the last man. We can also credit the director for the relative success of the movie. William Goldman's screenplay is all dialogue, and director Alan J. Pakula was able to take those words and bring them on screen while keeping the movie's tempo at a fast pace and getting performances out of all his actors.So to understand this movie means you need to understand what led up to the infamous Watergate Scandal. That is essentially the plot of the movie. Heading up to the 1972 presidential elections, Bob Woodward (Robert Redford)-a reporter for the Washington Post, uncovers what seems to be a minor break-in at the Democratic Party National Headquarters. He grows suspicious when he sees that top defense lawyers are on the case already. The editor of the Post, Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) wants to run the story and he assigns Woodward and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) to do so. As they uncover more information, they see how high up the Republican Party is involved in this cover up.Another reason why this movie worked is because of the charm and pedigree of the cast. The movie is given an unusually stacked cast given the time period of the film. What I really liked about this cast is how they become so immersed in their roles. I wasn't watching Robert Redford or Dustin Hoffman, but instead I was watching Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They truly became reporters on screen, and that is the mark of a good actor. To become the person the actors are playing. Redford and Hoffman were outstanding and they show great chemistry with each other. Let's not forget about the smaller characters though. Jason Robards did an excellent job as the executive editor Ben Bradlee who always shown support in his reporters even if things went south. Martin Balsam does a solid job as the managing editor, Howard Simons. Then we have Jane Alexander as the woman who provided the men with their best leads. Last but not least, we have the great Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, the mysterious source of the men. Everyone was able to take the words from William Goldman's screenplay and make it their own words, which it's very hard to do in the movies.On the whole, All The President's Men is a fine movie. Although I feel this could have been an instant classic that could have been destined for greatness. In some eyes, it is. Given its long length, this film could have been overly dull and tedious, but the cast, Pakula's incredible direction, and a really interesting story were able to make this a taut, entertaining thriller. We get to learn about the journalistic process given that its repeated in several cycles, which can grow tiresome at some point. I liked this movie enough to give this movie a recommend, especially if you're interested in seeing how the Watergate Scandal came to be with the utmost historical accuracy. Also this movie is just a good vehicle for the starpower of Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.My Grade: B",All the President's Men
88,bob998,A relief,8,2 November 2017,"Alan Pakula was a director with a limited range. He had his hits--Klute, Sophie's Choice and this film--but he also had misses like Rollover and Comes a Horseman owing to lack of empathy with these genres. Give him a thriller with lots of menace and he is in his element as he is here.The acting is really fine. Everyone remembers Jason Robards and Jack Warden as the newspapermen, but Jane Alexander as the nervous CREEP employee is excellent, as is Stephen Collins as Sloan, a minor figure but touching in his desire not to get trapped in wrongdoing. Lindsey Crouse has a small part as a young reporter with scruples.I watch this at least once a year, but this being the year of Trump, I know I'm going to be watching much more. There is no chance of newspapers bringing down a president--we are beyond that period of history--but it is comforting to remember when they could.",All the President's Men
89,spookyrat1,Stop the Presses!,10,15 August 2020,"The ultimate in investigative journalism pictures, Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men, is like a fine wine, just getting better with age. I've seen it around half a dozen times, since its initial release. It never fails to hold the attention and there are always new facets of the film to enjoy and appreciate. Amazingly for about the truest story you could get, this side of a documentary, it invariably finds itself classified generically, as a political thriller, which I feel is a deserving compliment of Pakula's skills as a director and William Goldman's exceedingly intelligent adaption of Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward's non-fiction book of the same name.The acting is superb from all comers. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as the two initially mismatched, unalike newshounds, riff off each other a la Jagger and Richards; as if they've been operating that way all their working lives. Jason Robards commands authority and gravitas, as Ben Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post and deservedly won the first of his 2 supporting actor Oscars for the role. But the whole cast is highly experienced and the talent on display in even the more minor supporting roles shines brightly.This is the film that raised the bar when it comes to depicting a major newspaper's work site of that era. One has to agree with Roger Ebert who wrote that ...""It provides the most observant study of working journalists we're ever likely to see in a feature film."" Hard to dispute and again its Oscar for art direction and set design could hardly be disputed.Gordon Willis's cinematography strikes exactly the right tone whether it be daylight, nocturnal, interior or exterior scenes. And David Shire's chief musical motif has become almost iconically familiar with the passing of time.The ingeniousness of Goldman's and Pakula's collaboration is that the film is framed as a detective mystery complete with red herrings and dead ends. Despite the exceptionally complex detail of the Watergate scandal, every thing becomes extremely watchable and surprisingly taut in the telling, whilst the underlying themes of abusive executive power remain timeless and as relevant in the 21st century, as they were in the 20th.",All the President's Men
90,Atreyu_II,A lesson about journalism,7,15 August 2007,"""All The President's Men"" is an interesting movie based on a true story, in this case the Watergate political scandal, which took place between 1972 and 1974. Back then Richard Nixon was the President of the United States of America.This movie focuses mostly on the journalism's perspective about the Watergate scandal. It has nothing to do with ""The Insider"", but somehow it closely resembles ""The Insider"".""All The President's Men"" can teach us many things about what it's like to be a journalist. ""The Insider"" also teaches us this kind of thing.The story is real and the movie is slow (it requires patience), but reasonably made: a good combination of real facts, journalism, suspense, thriller, tension, darkness, images from television, machinery, old music and some humorous moments.The actors are great and some of them are legends, such as Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford and Jack Warden.Dustin Hoffman plays the role of Carl Bernstein and Robert Redford plays Bob Woodward, the two main characters of the movie. They both steal the show as the two journalists of the Washington Post. They are both ambitious and a good example because they take their job very seriously. That is something very needed for a job like that.Jack Warden is great too, but his character (Harry M. Rosenfeld) appears few times.Deep Throat is a funny, complex, mad and enigmatic character. No wonder, with a nickname like that... and he's very well played by the actor.The director Alan J. Pakula did a good job with this film.This motion picture has one of the most peculiar endings ever created: writing machines that continually write very quickly and without stopping. The way how they did this is incredible!Movies about journalism may not be the most exciting thing to watch, but they are interesting and, with an open mind and if given a chance, it's easy to appreciate them. They also give good perspectives about the stories which they are based. For those who like this kind of movies and this one in particular, I recommend ""The Insider"" as well.",All the President's Men

92,Pedro_H,The movie for all journalists and would-be journalists.,8,2 April 2005,"The true story of how two minor journalists opened up a can of worms that led to the downfall of the President of the United States. A story almost too strange for fiction.The fact that the outcome is known to everybody watching doesn't seem to matter - it is a how-done-it rather than a who-done-it.The only thing I think is bad about the film is that is exposes some of the tricks of the journalists' trade!Hoffman and Redford (Carl Bernstien and Edward Woodward) don't give showy performances and they are not fleshed out off-the-job. Woodward wasn't a natural writer and despite having the scoop of anyone's lifetime hasn't really gone on to do anything other than write a trust-breaking biography of John Belushi. Despite the overall achievement what they printed wasn't entirely right. But that is a history book judgement and not one that we should dwell on. What they did get right is the fact that the other papers seems frightened of the story. They hung back until they were told it was safe to go in the water. Now the internet is one with the bravery!I also find it hard to fathom out Redford (Woodward) who is a Republican (so he says) and yet doesn't question that what he is doing to his own side. Who could have predicated what might have happened at the end of this story - rioting on the streets, the breakdown of law and order? Stranger things have happened.Jason Robards is perfect as the editor Ben Bradlee. There is a gravitas about him that doesn't need lines or dialogue. He is what they call in France ""the king actor"" there is something about him that suggests that he is the main man without doing anything much to actually justify it. You either have it or you haven't. The expensive sets are brilliant too. The third part of a platonic love triangle. Just a big room with desks and people really. People hammering away. People laughing and joking. TV sets play to nobody or everybody. The lens stays sharp from front to back so as to get it all in. Newspaper offices are a place of constant distraction the writer has to block them out to in order to hammer out the story. This is the day of the typewriter so the noise must have been louder than it appears on film. The jigsaw doesn't come together quickly. Indeed they don't have a box cover to see what they are constructing. The Washington Post doesn't take them off the story as it gets bigger and bigger. Did others help? Surely they must have. Equally the lawyers (of both sides) must have been circling in real life. They are taking on government itself and that is something that everyone should be weary of. The end is a masterpiece. Probably the best ending in the entire history of cinema. It totally takes you off guard and runs against everything that you have been built up to expect. However the greatest ideas are often the simple ones.",All the President's Men

94,jdkraus,An average film with too good of a concept and topic.,6,20 September 2014,"In the wake of Watergate and President Nixon's resignation, All the President's Men marked itself as a controversial and compelling film for a nation in a tumultuous time. It was hailed as a masterpiece by critics and it won 4 Academy Awards. Looking back nearly 40 years, the movie is really an example of intriguing subject versus great storytelling. This does not necessarily hinder a decent film, but it also doesn't guarantee a master work either. The pivotal force is centered on the perspectives of two young and eager journalists Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford). Their mission is to uncover the facts about the Watergate break-in. Instead of investigating a simple burglary, they find themselves in government cover-ups, witnesses that will not talk, and even names that do not exist. A story so juicy and fruitful cannot be overlooked. For two hours and eighteen minutes, the audience observes as these men try to get to the bottom of this rabbit hole. While the substance is good and it reflects one of America's darkest times, the pace and delivery is cut and dry. Nothing exciting happens in this movie. The character interactions between Bernstein and Woodward are bland. No acting chemistry is present. They are just two guys who happen to work together. There are no memorable moments that these great thespians share together on camera. The supporting cast is equally uninspiring. Jane Alexander, who received an Oscar nomination for her performance, is only in the movie for 10 minutes and acts as if she has a nervous twitch and seems more than happy to walk off the movie's set ASAP. Jason Robards, who did win an Academy Award for supporting actor, appears in a sleepy trance throughout the film as the head of the newspaper organization. The amount of times he sets his feet up on a table and leans back in his chair, I half expected him to take a nap. Frankly, if this is what it takes to win some accolades, sign me up. Jack Warden as Bernstein and Woodward's boss and Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat are the only actors that unveil some infliction and power in their performances. Unfortunately, Holbrook's prowess is hidden in the shadows by cinematographer Gordon Willis, intentionally adding the secretive nature of his character. I could very well be judging this movie a bit too harshly. I did not grow up during the reign of Nixon, so I cannot comprehend this movie's power at its release. However, I can look back at history from a nostalgic perspective and determine whether I like an older film. Taxi Driver, Network, Rocky, and The Marathon Man were all released the same year as All the President's Men. All of them are excellent films that can never grow dated or lose their entertainment values. ""All the President's Men"" is linked to the past and purely documents a single event in time. It relies too much on facts and details that it forgets to tell an engrossing plot. This is the main reason why I cannot accept this movie as a masterpiece. The subject matter did get me through the film once, but I can never see myself viewing it again. The highlights that I do give this movie is the dedication that the set designers put into the recreation of the newsroom, Gordon Willis's lighting style for the night scenes, and the sound mixers accomplishment of overlaying land line phone calls with meticulous perfection. In short, this is an average film with too good of a concept and topic.",All the President's Men
95,AhmedSpielberg99,"A ""Hitchcockian"" political thriller!",8,4 June 2018,"Alan J. Pakula made a very smart decision by not making this movie longer. Because I think Oliver Stone made a mistake by making the runtime of JFK three hours and nine minutes, and the director's cut even longer by 17 minutes! The result, in the case of JFK, was that the movie focused more than it should do on some subplots that really didn't add too much to the story. All the President's Men, instead, made a good use of every minute in it with its reasonable runtime. All the President's Men can be described as a ""Hitchcockian"" political thriller. Its tension and suspense are unprecedented in this sub-genre. The Oscar-winner script, with all its cleverness, isn't the only powerful aspect about the movie. Alan J. Pakula directing is very entertaining. Besides building the tension, he shot many long scenes that really deserve to be of the most iconic scenes in film. The performances are all great; Redford has the most of the screen time, and I wouldn't have been surprised if he had an Oscar nod. He has a particular scene in which he changed his face expressions so gracefully. Hoffman is one of my favorite actors and he gave one of his best performances in this movie; his character is so energetic and impulsive and he just got it right. But the performance that really standout is Jason Robards' performance as Ben Bradlee, the executive editor of The Washington Post. Robards, without a doubt, deserved his Oscar for best supporting actor.At the middle of its third act, I think the movie suffered a little bit moving between two sub-plots; it moved very fast between them and I think it should have made a small breather to keep me gripped, and to make me invested in the new sub-plot from its beginning.There were many secondary characters in this movie and they were all great, except one character that I felt it should have given some more depth because it has an important role near the end, and a background could have filled some logical gaps. With that being said, this character is very interesting and you may be interested to search about it after watching the movie.(8.5/10)",All the President's Men

The two are very believable in their roles as the reporters who cracked the whole watergate scandal for the Washington Post.

98,silverscreen888,Fine Dramatized Biography of Honest Reporters Who Brought Down a President,7,5 July 2007,"""All the President's Men"" (1976) I suggest set a tone for many films whose makers have since copied aspects of its full-color, cinema verite low-key style. Written for the screen by William Golding from the book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the story is a ""dramatized biography"" that unfolds step-by-step the two young Washington Post reporters' investigation of a mysterious break-in at the Watergate Hotel. As directed by Alan J, Pakula, the film is low-intensity in its lighting, often all-but colorless and yet surprisingly varied in its scenes; the director eschews flashy moments and chooses instead to allow what the two reporters are doing to speak for itself. From the time the reporters, working independently on the same story, bridge their differences and start working together effectively, the viewer learns the scope, import and risks of what they are doing and discovering along with their superiors and along with the two young newsmen turned sleuths. The film's producers, Jon Boorstin, Michael Britton and Walter Coblenz deserve credit for the same restraint that David L. Shire I assert is to be praised for in his understated but effective music composed for the piece. Gordon Willis and George Jenkins manage as cinematographer and production designer to achieve a compelling, sometimes grainy yet convincing look from the film's beginning to its rousing end. George Gaines's set decorations and the dress in the film is without blemish, by my standards; even where the result is not wholly admirable it is always perhaps believable enough. The film mixes in real footage of the Nixon presidency and TV clips; and this touch of realism also contributes to the overall effort. As is true of most good dramatized biographies, the acting of the work is all-important to the film's overall effect. There is one shortcoming the film has, I claim: Actors of the stature of Jason Robards Jr., Martin Balsam, Jane Alexander, Ned Beatty, Allyn Ann McLerie, John Randolph, Gene Dynarski, Hal Holbrook, Penny Fuller, Stephen Collins, Lindsay Crouse, Meredith Baxter, John McMartin, Nate Esformes, Polly Holliday and many more deserved much more to do than they were allowed. Jack Warden lacks the speech pattern for his central role as the young reporters' supervisor, but is strong and tough-minded. Almost uniformly, all the actors do whatever is asked of them well-enough not to impede the plot's progress. The scene where Woodward, played by Robert Redford in professionally-controlled style, playing off Dustin Hoffman's more emotional Nernstein characterization, thinks he is being stalked in an underground garage as he meets with his secret source ""Deep Throat"" (Hal Holbrook), is very charged and memorable. The film achieves a true power and a very strong climax I argue, but the greatest accomplishment its makers can boast of is perhaps having made a devastating indictment of a president who misused his constitutional position to seek power--a point as timely today, a hundred years ago, and 300,000 years from now as it is in this ethical and absorbing film.",All the President's Men
99,virek213,Just follow the money,10,17 July 2001,"Lengthy and full of details but nevertheless one of the greatest movies ever made, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN still manages to work even twenty-five years after its release.As we all know, this film revolves around the efforts of Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Redford) of the Washington Post to get at the truth behind that little ""third-rate burglary"" that happened at the Watergate building in the early morning hours of June 17, 1972.  Bit by little bit, a disturbing puzzle forms.  With some assistance from Redford's shadowy secret source known as Deep Throat (Holbrook), who tells Redford ""Just follow the money"", the two men find a trail of lies, threats, electronic surveillance, and other forms of political chicanery that lead right to the Executive Office Building of the White House, whose occupant of course was Richard M. Nixon.Watergate, as they were to find out, was only part of a vast conspiracy within the entire U.S. intelligence community to sabotage not only the Democrats during the '72 election but to also crush ANY opposition of ANY kind to Nixon.  Once this whole thing was unraveled, it led to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the first time a president ever stepped down in disgrace (and, if we're lucky, the last).ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a combination of political drama and character study that remains compulsively watchable to this day.  Jason Robards won a justly-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar as the Post's avuncular editor Ben Bradlee, and William Goldman won Best Adapted Screenplay.  Also featured here in extremely effective roles are Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Robert Walden, and Ned Beatty.  The fine direction of Alan J. Pakula (KLUTE) is the icing on the cake.For a follow-up to this story, look for THE FINAL DAYS, a 2 1/2 hour TV movie based on the second Watergate book by ""Woodstein"" that looks at Nixon's tumultuous collapse of power prior to his resignation.  In the meantime, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN ranks a solid and unequivoal 10.",All the President's Men

It may be too slow for some, but it just keeps my attention during every second.This movie has one of my favorite scenes of all time.
That scene with Robert Redford on the telephone. You know, the one that's like a five minute long uncut close-up of him talking. Yeah, that's one of the best movie scenes ever filmed, and the fact that he messes up a line and they kept it in makes it even better.I love this movie.",All the President's Men
101,Eumenides_0,One of the best in the genre,9,10 April 2013,"1976 was a magical year for cinema: Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Bertolucci's Novecento, Bergman's Face to Face, Polanski's The Tenant, Zurlini's The Desert of the Tartars, Bozzetto's Allegro non Troppo. No doubt many other masterpieces came out that year, but although I can't remember or know them all, there's one I'm not likely ever to forget: All The President's Men.The seventies were being a good decade for Alan J. Pakula: he had already made two excellent movie, first the crime drama Klute (1971), for which Jane Fonda got her first Oscar, and then the paranoid extravaganza The Parallax View (1974), still very entertaining, and gorgeous to look at thanks to Gordon Willis' cinematography. The Parallax View starred a journalist (a brash performance by Warren Beatty) trying to untangle a vast governmental/corporate conspiracy that involved brain-washed assassins. His next movie, as a way of conclude this loose trilogy, was also a story about journalists uncovering a conspiracy on the higher echelons of government – what makes it infinitely more disturbing is that it is all true.No one should have to live in a world where it's perfectly reasonable to write that this movie is about two journalists thwarting the sinister machinations of corrupt American President Richard Nixon, but we're not to blame if truth more often than not looks like a rejected Jamed Bond plot. Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford give extraordinary performances (Redford especially; Hoffman is undoubtedly a greater actor, so it's more exciting when Redford admiringly holds his ground against him) playing Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two journalists for The Washington Post who investigate the Watergate break-in and slowly unravel a presidential conspiracy that, in time, would lead to Nixon himself. Around them is a cast of some of the best actors from America's past and some still going strong nowadays: Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook, Jason Robards, Ned Beatty, Jane Alexander. The movie was written by William Goldman, and many of the crewmembers were regular Pakula collaborators: David Shire on the music, bringing adding his chilling and minimalist style to the atmosphere of the movie, and DP Gordon Willis lighting and framing each frame with the usual artistry that he displayed in The Godfather trilogy.All The President's Men is an intelligent, slow-paced but tense political thriller that honours the best done in the genre – this may well be America's response to Costa-Gavras' superb Z (1969) – and that has left a mark too on all that followed – think of The Insider and State of Play, for instance. This movie pretty much helped codify the language and tropes of things we expect to see in movies of this type – journalists fearing for their lives, a non-cooperative government, night conversations in dark garages, leaked documents, the inner workings of newspapers. There's nothing clichéd here, though, each scene and trope still has vitality not only for inventing them in the first place but for setting such a high standard for imitators.",All the President's Men
102,oOoBarracuda,"""It's a non-denial denial.""",8,7 November 2016,"Alan J. Pakula directed, in 1976, a film with such rich source material as the nation's first ever president to resign, Richard Nixon. All the President's Men, starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, as the two reporters for The Washington Post that uncovered the details of the Watergate break-in that spanned all the way to the White House involving the president. Reminding the audience of a time in which the printed word reigned supreme and reporters were also detectives, capable of uncovering anything, All the President's Men was a brilliantly written film, incredibly deserving of taking home Oscar's top prize for Best Original Screenplay.As the 1972 presidential election is upon the nation, there is a break-in at the Watergate. Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) begins investigating the break-in, believing there to be deeper implications behind the break-in. Inserting himself into Woodward's work on the story, fellow reporter Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) begins investigating as well. Both men are a bit on the outs with the paper, with Woodward being newer on the staff and Bernstein who rarely finishes his stories. The two are an unlikely duo for such serious work, yet begin getting answers that are impressing and surprising themselves and their colleagues. Along with the constant guidance from Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook) to ""follow the money"" which leads them to uncover large amounts of money being deposited into the accounts of the Watergate burglars and where that money came from exposing how high up the ladder the money trail goes. The closer they get to the truth, the more desperate the implicated parties are to squash the story, the reporter's reputations, and The Washington Post itself.I had been meaning to see All the President's Men for some time but continually avoided it due to a distaste of Dustin Hoffman's acting. I still hold out hope that I just haven't seen the right Hoffman films so I finally saw Pakula's 1976 feature. Dustin Hoffman was perfect in the seedy, underhanded role of Carl Bernstein. An added surprise was seeing Martin Balam's name rolling by on the opening credits. No matter how small his role is, he always brings great dimensions to his character. Robert Redford was also brilliantly cast as the diligent, serious reporter, Bob Woodward. In fact, Robert Redford may have been best in this role and truly missed out on any acclaim from Oscar for this role. All the President's Men, the better-acted version of the 2015 film Spotlight, has within it a recipe for a boring movie. Reporters gathering facts, typing, talking amongst themselves, and dead-ends are highlighted brilliantly against the perfect production design of the film preventing the audience from realizing the movie spans nearly two and a half hours. Alan J. Pakula also shows his directorial prowess by picking the absolute perfect place to end his film, at the inauguration of Richard Nixon's second term in office. The audience knows what's coming, we're invested in the work the reporting duo has done and are acutely aware that the seemingly perfect scene of Richard Nixon accepting office is nothing of the illusion that it seems. Closing the film with the public looking one way while the reporters are in the background of the shot, feverishly working on the story that will bring the president's misdeeds to the nation was a stroke of brilliance, sure to stay with the audience long after the film ends.",All the President's Men
103,policy134,We all know how it ends,8,28 May 2011,"Journalism was still kind of a revered profession when this was made but I don't think that many movie directors had thought about making a movie about journalism and particularly a movie that weren't about showbiz journalist. I think the last movie that dealt with the subject was ""The Front Page"", but it was more about the glamour of it all.There is nothing glamorous about the subject in this really good, but also flawed take. The flaws are minor but I wouldn't consider this to be the masterpiece that some will undoubtedly see it. First off, the movie is a bit sketchy about who Woodward and Bernstein were. At the time I saw this movie for the first time, I didn't think they were actual living persons.The movie goes to a great length to show almost all the key persons who were involved in the scandal of the century. The problem is that so many names are hurled at the viewer that it is hard to separate them. At one point I thought that two characters in this were the same person.Otherwise, it was just great to see a movie with a different subject than most films. There are no love scenes, no shootings and no violence and that is what makes it unique. Redford and Hoffman are good in it too and despite some comments, that declares Hoffman as the better actor, let's not forget that Bernstein is the more flashy character. Redford must be credited for his very contained performance that reveal almost nothing about the demeanor of his character until one pivotal moment involving a major break in the case.",All the President's Men

It's difficult to imagine how you can show people making phone calls and checking documents in a way that is both thrilling and realistic. But this movie does it really well. It brings you into the case, and by selecting some of the more important moments, it lets you follow it in a fast pace, while still feeling that every discovery is worked for. It's like you are taking part in the whole investigation, from the sidelines. And the movie is mostly no BS. You follow the investigators as they are working, and the work that they do. Sure, these are people with lives and emotions, but when it's not related to the work, they don't show it.This movie is also interesting to see, as it shows how much work research could be before the digital age we are now in.

It's suspenseful and very engaging, but I do wish it would have spent more time on the personal lives and the emotions that Bernstein and Woodward must have been going through. But when you have that many facts to go over in a two and half hour film, your main focus definitely becomes getting the facts and adrenaline of the story and this film perfectly nails that. It gets us to cheer when they cheer and to be disappointed when they are, which is what any good film should do. We become emotionally involved with these characters. There are a lot of names flying around at high speeds though so if you aren't informed on the Watergate Scandal, you may get a little lost (thankfully for me I find it to be one of the most interesting events ever) but it's nothing too terrible. The performances really shine; Hoffman and Redford are phenomenal and Jason Robards (who won an Oscar for his performance) and Hal Holbrook steal every scene they're in.",All the President's Men
108,roghache,Fascinating and dramatic portrayal of Watergate uncovering,9,19 March 2006,"Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman give brilliant performances in portraying, respectively, Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, in their investigation of the apparently minor burglary of the Watergate Hotel's Democratic National Headquarters office, which ultimately resulted in the resignation of President Nixon. This movie also features an excellent supporting cast.The viewer gets an amazing sense of the journalistic story's progression and its implications, from the initial covering of the Watergate burglary, through all the various leads that point a trail up through high ranking Republican Party officials, and finally right into the White house itself. Particularly interesting is the interaction between the two reporters hot on the trail, and the cautious Post editors who insist that they have at least two independent corroborating sources before publishing the facts. (Pity the modern press at times doesn't take such efforts to ensure the reliability of stories they are exposing.)This insistence of course led to that enigmatic and mysterious figure known as Deep Throat, a high government official of unknown identity, who held clandestine meetings with Woodward in parking garages. These meetings, most viewers would agree, make for some of the most dramatic and chilling scenes in the movie. For years there was of course speculation as to the identity of Deep Throat (portrayed here by Hal Holbrook), recently unmasked as Mark Felt, the FBI's number two man during that era.This is a magnificent movie that dramatically recreates for the viewer actual historical events, as seen from the perspective of the two reporters who uncovered the story. Hoffman and Redford are masterful in portraying the journalists' roles, their very disparate personalities, and the relationship (at first competitive, later cooperative) between the two reporters. It might tend to give the average viewer a bit more understanding of the aggressive methods employed by, and sometimes actually required of, journalists in obtaining their story. Although everyone knows the story's ending, this fantastic movie, nevertheless, still manages to be a bit of a thriller.",All the President's Men

112,ilpohirvonen,"Cigarettes, Typewriters, and Truths from the Shadows",7,16 February 2015,"The 1970's, and especially the so-called Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, marked a turning point in the not-so-distant American history. This turning point also cast its shadow on American popular cinema, and several political thrillers, drawing inspiration from Costa-Gavra's highly successful and influential ""Z"" (1969), depicting the loss of credibility and trust for the state were made. Alan J. Pakula's ""All the President's Men"" (1976) is the central film and how suiting it is since ""All the President's Men"" retells the story which revealed the truth of the scandal that inspired this change; that is to say, the story of two reporters of the Washington Post, Bernstein and Woodward.Although the film might at first glance seem to be nothing but a visualization of a story that should have been expressed in writing, one slowly begins to realize that this appearance is really the strength of the film. In other words, Pakula's rigid and tight tension is due to his relentless dramaturgic desire to show only what matters story-wise -- and not just the story of the film, but the historical story that prevailed in the reality of 1976 America -- and nothing more. This stripping of everything superfluous creates a unique atmosphere whose grip is quite difficult to escape once one has started the film.If ""All the President's Men"" as a historical (yes, historical) film tries to tell about a certain time in history, it also reveals something of its own time which is, of course, veritably close to the time its diegetic world takes place in. The spectator is given the chance to observe the work of investigating journalism before the revolution of the Internet when the three most important instruments of a reporter were telephones, typewriters, and cigarettes. One call after another, tapping words on a typewriter all night, and burning cigarettes like crazy characterize their everyday lives. Information must be discovered from libraries, archives, and unorthodox sources instead of typing a search term for Google. These words aren't meant for self-deliberate nostalgia, but rather to capture what takes place in front of our eyes when we sit around ""All the President's Men""; to feel its feel, to sense its sense, so to speak.More importantly than revealing the reality of 70's journalism, the film, of course, reveals the reality of 70's politics. Not only does the film do this, however, but also encapsulate a world whose sounds, smells, and sights we can now inhale after many a decade. ""All the President's Men"" tells about a world of paranoia and fear, tormented by the uneasy threat of the Cold War. It's a world where the media creates lies and conceals, but where it can also be used to reveal that deception. It's a world where one must creep into the darkness of a night-time parking lot to hear the truths beneath the surface, the truths from the shadows which are intimidating and exhilarating, stirring yet liberating.So, at its heart, ""All the President's Men"" is mainly interesting as a period picture, yet not only in the sense of showing what life was like in back then but also capturing its zeitgeist. Nonetheless, each time I see the film I am certain of the fact that its strength -- the total focus on the story -- is also its weakness since it can never rise above it and become something glorious, life-altering, and shattering. But the more important thing is that it doesn't want to. It is fine with what it is and as it is, a revelation or (if one is feeling less generous) a capture of a revelation. What is certain is that it is important and as such it shall remain.",All the President's Men

114,dy158,The story behind the story,8,29 November 2012,"It is a story which the final outcome is a well-known fact. The case of the 37th President of the United States in Richard Nixon resigning from his post, before Nixon's former vice-president Gerald Ford took over. It is the story of Watergate, and the two Washington Post reporters who will come to be known for their reports. It is based on the book of the same name written by the two reporters from the Washington Post at the time of Watergate in Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who would come to uncover what, would lead to the eventual resignation of Nixon.It is June 1972. There was a break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex. The young Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) was assigned to cover the story at the courthouse and began to establish the identities and the backgrounds of the five who were caught in the break-in. It would lead him to conclude the five were being connected with E. Howard Hunt, a former CIA employee and Charles Colson, the special counsel to the president Richard Nixon. As the break-in would become more than just how it looked on the surface and took on a more political twist to it, Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) would come to be assigned to the story as well, along with the colleague he only knew briefly before in Woodward.Woodward and Bernstein went from being reluctant partners to collaborating well together, following up on the two men (Hunt and Colson) in connection with the five burglars. The Post's executive editor Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards) was not convinced what Woodward and Bernstein had uncovered so far to be deemed worthy of being on the front page, and encouraged them to uncover more information. Among the sources who were willing to talk to the duo assigned to cover the story apart from those who refused to divulge details or slammed them or the Post in various ways all coming at a time when Nixon would be undergoing a re-election campaign and was guaranteed to beat his Democratic opponent George McGovern, there is an anonymous source whom Woodward had used before and trusted who goes by the codename of Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook).As it shows throughout the course of the film, which was released two years after the resignation of Nixon and the publication of the book which formed the basis of the film of the same name, there is nothing glamorous in terms of the process Woodward and Bernstein went through before getting their reports to be on the Post. Doors getting slammed in their faces, the doubts from the various Post editors on the sources Woodward and Bernstein had used in their reports including Deep Throat.Watching the film, it is also a reminder of the press at its best. Watch it as a reminder of a time of how it was in Woodward and Bernstein's day. It is a film for fans of American politics and contemporary American history, those who like a little sense of adventure and suspense in films, and definitely recommended for students of media and aspiring journalists.",All the President's Men
115,Silverzero,"Absorbing, fact based drama. Clever, well acted and brilliantly executed.",10,9 May 2003,"When real life events are transferred to the big screen, the result can be hit and miss. The main problem is that facts can be stretched to (attempt to) make it better and they can also be over indulgent and much to romanticised. Luckily, `All the President's Men' avoids this problem, presenting us with a factual and interesting story involving the infamous Watergate scandal with Ex-President Richard Nixon. The film doesn't let emotions get in the way and is strictly objective, which in this case, is a good thing. The premise is as predictable as Antarctic weather, but we're supposed to know the result before going in to watch it.
The movie gets its beauty from the ways that the two reporters uncover the truth. The tactics and actions are intelligent and fascinating to watch. At some points, the film seems a little thin though, and the paranoia isn't enough to carry it. But as twists and plot revelations occur, it gradually sucks you into the story. There is also a murky but deeply in-tone atmosphere that surrounds the proceedings. There is no soundtrack and no songs occur during the duration. This adds to the `documentary-ish' atmosphere but doesn't help build the intensity along the way.
The story alone holds your attention for a good while but loses its way about 10 minutes from the end. Nevertheless, it's nice to see that the paranoia is finally justified. The only other noticeable flaw is that it may be politically correct, but lacks bite; something that similar political documentary director Oliver Stone greatly succeeds at when he attempts to `shatter' the American Dream. There are great performances from Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the leads. At the same time though, this calibre of roles, which do not require emotional power aren't very challenging but the duo pull it off with the greatest ease in the respective parts as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the support. Jason Robards did not deserve the Academy Award he won for his un-challenging role as the editor of the company. But the rest of the cast including Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook, Jane Alexander and Ned Beatty give standard performances.
Despite some faults, `All the President's Men' excels with equal stamina in being a paranoiac political thriller along with an objective documentary/ character study. It lacks bite, but it more then compensates with energy and interest. My IMDb rating: 7.1/10.",All the President's Men

A lot of people said Spotlight came close to being as good as this, personally I found Spotlight a lot more high-stakes and exciting. This movie feels too much like an excerpt from a much larger story. Deep Throat is already a known associate of Woodward, most of the fallout from the story happens after the credits roll and a lot of what we see is the interviews with a myriad of supporting players we can't possibly remember.Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford make a pretty good team, though I felt their working relationship was underwritten. Redford is too confident and assured to be the character constantly dismiss as a rookie. The acting makes up for it, especially the hard work the two great actors put in to memorising each others lines. This allows the two to constantly interrupt each other just like real journalists would when breaking this story. A feeling of scriptedness would have killed the magnetic atmosphere Pakula creates.Of the supporting cast, there's not much to note (which is somewhat shocking considering that there's two Oscar nominees and a win in here). Jason Robards gets a few nice moments as Ben Bradlee, but he's got none of the depth John Slattery brought to Bradlee Jr. in Spotlight and certainly none of the drama brought by Burt Young and Burgess Meredith in Rocky, who Robards beat for the Oscar that year. Jane Alexander has one ""oh yeah, I can see some acting there"", but her eight minute part is incredibly forgettable and inexplicably nominated.There's a couple of fantastic lines of dialogue, but for the most part the story is very difficult to follow. We're chasing this lead now, now we're chasing a guy who had something to do with the guy who had something to do with the thing we were just talking about. Pakula struggles to keep the energy up in low-tension scenes of Woodward and Bernstein chatting in restaurants or on porches, and especially during one too many ""its not enough"" scenes where the story gets rejected.However, Pakula's direction of the Watergate infiltration in the opening is stunningly tense, I jumped at least twice. I loved the use of sound, whether it be the constant hammering of typewriter keys to keep energy up or the flicker of a cigarette lighter to get Woodward's attention. The cinematography of Gordon Willis is a key part of the film's suspense and high stakes, especially the gorgeous lighting (and lack thereof) on Deep Throat's face and the placement of Nixon addresses with Woodward and Bernstein working furiously in the background. When the film closes, not a lot has been done. We don't get to see the fallout, only the procedure. I'd much rather re-read The Pelican Brief or watch Spotlight to see journalism at its most thrilling. What we get here is competent but a bit boring too often.",All the President's Men
118,asifahsankhan,"Just ""Follow the Money"" and see the Most Powerful (Yet Seemingly Fictional) Political Thriller!",8,14 June 2017,"""All the President's Men"" may be more historically inaccurate than accurate but it sure details a depth of political corruption at the time seemed unfathomable. Doesn't mean one can actually do less these days though, but when people seem to be genuinely pleased that newspapers are indeed dying, what they are essentially saying is that one of major tools to monitor the proper workings of government is no longer necessary. Thus, corruption can continue unchecked, democracy eroded even further.When I first watched this film, that's over 20 years after it's release. I had no idea about any of the details of Watergate whatsoever. I mean, I was a mare child in some classy school in London.Over 30 years before that was, Richard Nixon, impeached for spying on and sabotaging his political rivals and it all came to light because a handful of burglars got caught breaking into National Democratic Headquarters, which were located in an apartment complex known as ""Watergate"". The story was revealed due to a couple of reporters at the Washington Post, Woodward and Bernstein. That's it, that's all I knew. I didn't even know Woodward and Bernstein's first names. Just the bare minimum (I mean, I think ANY American should know that much, no? But I'm 150% English. With added 50% of USA and rising? that's 200% from both worlds).Here's the thing though. It doesn't matter that you don't know who Bob Haldeman was, you'll figure out enough of what's going on via context, and then the rest of the movie will work its magic on you. By the time the credits roll you'll be saying, that was so awesome, even though you still couldn't tell me what John Ehrlichmans title was at the White House. I've explained the level of complexity in the story as way of illustrating all the challenges this movie overcomes. What winds up happening isn't that the complexity overwhelms the viewer the viewer picks up on the necessary elements and enjoys the movie, while the Watergate-knowledgeable viewer winds up having a film full of details and minutiae to cherish.How do they do it? By focusing on the excitement of it. The adventure. All the President's Men is a thriller, people!! This is the greatest detective story of all time. Woodward and Bernstein were on a quest for the truth, and the truth was being protected by the most powerful people on the planet, with the full force of the government behind them!Woodward and Bernstein slowly come together as a team, and then slowly come to realise exactly what they're dealing with. Their suspicion grows. Evidence mounts.But as the story builds, so does the pressure. The stakes. Other newspapers are racing them to find the truth and to break the story first. People are trying to discredit them. At one point, their editor, Ben Bradlee (portrayed by Jason Robards, who won an Academy Award for this role) tell them, Were under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there. Nothings riding on this except the, uh, first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters, but if you guys f*ck up again, Im going to get mad. Goodnight.He wasn't exaggerating, either. Had the Nixon Whitehouse succeeded in blocking their investigation and remained in power, who knows what the consequences would have been for the press. It certainly wouldn't have boded well for the Washington Post, as Nixon most assuredly would have done everything in his power to bring them down.""All the President's Men"" is truer to the craft of journalism than to the art of storytelling, and that's its problem. The movie is as accurate about the processes used by investigative reporters as we have any right to expect, and yet process finally overwhelms narrative -- we're adrift in a sea of names, dates, telephone numbers, coincidences, lucky breaks, false leads, dogged footwork, denials, evasions, and sometimes even the truth. Just such thousands of details led up to Watergate and the Nixon resignation, yes, but the movie's more about the details than about their results.That's not to say the movie isn't good at accomplishing what it sets out to do. It provides the most observant study of working journalists we're ever likely to see in a feature film (Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein may at last, merciful God, replace Hildy Johnson and Walter Burns as career models). And it succeeds brilliantly in suggesting the mixture of exhilaration, paranoia, self-doubt, and courage that permeated the Washington Post as its two young reporters went after a presidency.Newspaper movies always used to play up the excitement and ignore the boredom and the waiting. This one is all about the boredom and the waiting and the tireless digging; it depends on what we already know about Watergate to provide a level of excitement. And yet, given the fact that William Goldman's screenplay is almost all dialogue, almost exclusively a series of scenes of people talking (or not talking) to each other, director Alan J. Pakula has done a remarkable job of keeping the pace taut. Does History still repeats itself?",All the President's Men
119,brefane,All the assembled talent,9,5 July 2013,"Unquestionably Alan J. Pakula's best film, All the President's Men is as good as any American film of the 70s and one of the few significant political films that Hollywood has ever produced. Though the film is based on well-known events, it compels as a low key thriller and thrills as study of journalism in the dogged pursuit of the truth. Hoffman, Redford, Jason Robards and Jane Alexander perform with admirable modesty and total believability. The film is soundly paced and intelligently written, and Pakula creates a persuasive atmosphere of uncertainty while maintaining a documentary-like realism. Like Scorceses's Goodfellas and Polanski's The Pianist, All the President's Men was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture.",All the President's Men
120,Sonatine97,A masterful retelling of political corruption at the top.,10,16 July 2000,"It took me sometime to really comprehend the true scale of the Watergate scandal prior to seeing this movie. From an Englishman's point of view my interest in American politicals was peripheral to say the least, since up until the 72/73 US politics was 99% Vietnam war coverage.However, after watching the film and reading the more detailed book from which the film is based I have to say that this is one of the best political movies I have seen.I was initially sceptical about using Redford & Hoffman playing the lead roles, thinking that they would play to the cameras letting their egos get in the way.But how wrong I was. Both play their journalistic roles with outstanding realism, especially from the slightly less mature Redford who seems to have a prerequisite in some of his movies whereby he has to bed at least one woman. But in this movie it's all boys talk, no subplots, no love interests just pure history telling at the highest level.But its not just the leads that carry the film. The support is just too good not to mention - Hal Holbrook as the anonymous Deep Throat, Jason Robards as the Kennedy-loving Ben Bradlee, editor of the Washington Post; and special mention must go to Warden & Balsam as deputy editors and Jean Alexander as the bookkeeper who played a key part in the final downfall of the president.With this kind of detailed political complexity its probably worth viewing the film a couple of times to really get to grips with some of the more subtle points.And of course it should be noted that Watergate wasn't the main reason for Nixon's resignation although it was a major factor. For a more rounded account of his fall from grace track down Nixon starring Anthony Hopkins. This film will fill in all the other details that President's Men didn't touch on.*****/*****",All the President's Men
121,brianberta,A well-acted and gripping drama.,9,9 September 2021,"I'm not the biggest fan of biopics. While they may be elevated by some strong acting or some decent camerawork, they often have little else on their minds other than championing whoever is at the heart of their stories or offering a straightforward retelling of whatever noteworthy thing the subject did. While my impression of them is generally ""I'd rather just research the person in the film rather than watch a movie about them"", this film is an exception to this criticism as it's as much about the process of how the Watergate scandal was uncovered as it is about the scandal itself. Regardless of where you stand politically, this film is a must-see.This films wraps you up in its story so well with a series of revelations about various people's involvements to the scandal and significant pieces of information coming to light that it keeps you on board with the investigation from beginning to end, even though the outcome of it is already known. As a cherry to all this, certain characters and events (Deep Throat, most of the witnesses being afraid to speak up, members of the CREEP potentially being in danger) add an extra layer of spice to the film and help to ensure that you won't grow bored while watching it. This film also feels relevant today given the various discussions and trials on impeachments/cover-ups/scandals which have permeated the news in the U. S. in the last few years or so.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman did a good job in this film and played their parts of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two Washington Post reporters with different levels of experience, pretty well. Woodward didn't have as much experience at his job as Bernstein did and often showed a reluctance to push the various witnesses they ran into for interviews when they were reluctant to talk, while Bernstein was more demanding with the people he interviewed and didn't accept no for an answer. As the scandal kept growing more and more widespread throughout their investigation and as the importance of solving it eventually dawned on Woodward though, he eventually assisted Bernstein in these endeavors. While Redford and Hoffman are good though, Jason Robards gives the best performance in the film. Even though I've only seen him in four or five films, he's blown me away in every single one of them, as he did in this film. With maybe the exception of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", I've only seen him in supporting roles, but he plays his part in this film quite phenomenally and proves magnetic whenever he's onscreen. His character has more experience than both Woodward and Bernstein and has to be really careful that the two of them have enough evidence before publishing it. After all, a slip up could potentially bring a bad name to their paper.",All the President's Men

123,kyle-cruse,Excellent depiction of the events,9,22 August 2008,"A true story in itself does not usually make a good film, but it's what the actors and director can do with that story that makes it great. ""All the President's Men"" does not tell the story of Watergate but rather the story of the reporters who broke the story. Even the story of a real-life event that managed to cause the U.S. so much stress manages to entertain in this film. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are well cast as Woodward and Bernstein, the reporters. Redford's best scene is probably the one with him scribbling on his notes while on the phone, and Hoffman's is probably him sneaking into an office after getting the secretary out of the room. In his Oscar-winning role, Jason Robards is excellent as the reporters' boss. The film tends to slow down a little about halfway through, though the dialogue remains somewhat interesting. I guess the film can be a little biased in the way that it shows the papers blackmailing the leaders. However, it is still an excellent film, close to perfection.

The collusion of the intelligence agencies should remain a concern for all Americans.

125,ryan_kuhn,"""It leads everywhere.""",8,13 February 2005,"The downfall of Richard Nixon has always been incredibly interesting, at least to me it has been. What lead to Watergate? Was Nixon so insecure about his own standing in the country that he had to find out what the Democrats were doing? Who knew what, and when did they know it? What were really on those tapes? I could go on, but no movie about the end of the Nixon Presidency answered, and raised more questions, then All The President's Men. Starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, respectively, the two men credited as breaking the Watergate scandal to the masses. What starts as a blurb on the newswire about a break-in at the Democrat's national headquarters in the Washington's Watergate Hotel, the film retells the investigation, based on the book by the same name by Woodward and Bernstein. Jason Robards plays Ben Bradley, editor of the Washington Post who gives direction and discretion to the story that could end a presidency. The magnitude of what the journalists reported comes across, we feel the pressure for them to get it right. If they are wrong, innocent people could lose in the court of public opinion, and their journalistic careers are over. Though told from the point of view of Woodward and Bernstein, the film is fair to all sides, the errors are retold as well as the successes. The film also brings the world the mythical creature known as ""Deep Throat,"" an anonymous figure who waits in the dark for the plucky reporters to come and ask him what he knows. To this day, the true identity of the inside man (or woman??) has yet to be revealed. The movie does end on an awkward note however, but perhaps the right note. The film is about the newspaper reporters, and when their job is over, so is the movie. We do not see the Congressional hearings about the White House, we just see a print out of the events that occurred after the movie. It is a bit sudden for some, but since the news investigation is over, Woodward and Bernstein's role in Watergate is over as well. You won't learn much about the personal paranoia that engulfed Nixon, for that, I suggest you check out Oliver Stone's lengthy bio-pic ""Nixon,"" but you will learn how the walls closed in on Nixon and his lies, lead by the press, specifically the Washington Post. All the President's Men show how wide in scope the government cover-up was regarding Watergate, and how 2 men asking the right questions, and with a little help from a mysterious man in a dark parking garage, can help set in motion the events to bring down an American President.",All the President's Men
126,Rathko,Heroic Journalists? Those were the days...,8,11 March 2005,"After the flawed but fascinating 'Parallax View', Alan J. Pakula learns from his mistakes, and delivers a more logical and satisfying story in 'All the Presidents Men'. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. Another bravado turn from cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a world of intensely glaring lights and ominously inky shadows. Subtle and realistic performances from the entire cast create a believable pressroom atmosphere of rivalry, idealism and integrity.The story has been the prototype for every conspiracy thriller since, establishing all the motifs that would eventually be exhausted by 'The X-Files' and become cliché. The narrative flows smoothly, and Goldman does an excellent job of reigning in a potentially incomprehensible plot line, a feat that won him a much-deserved Oscar. The story does, however, slow down in spots, becoming repetitious, and could have benefited from a little judicious pruning.An excellent movie, that not only sheds light on a historic episode without the usual glossy spin, but highlights the pitiful condition of modern journalism, a fall from grace that in time will prove to far more terrifying and long reaching than anything perpetrated by Nixon and his cronies.",All the President's Men
127,standardmetal,Should be required viewing for young people.,9,19 October 2006,"This film should be required viewing for all high school students particularly at the present time. I lived through the Watergate Scandals and investigations and I fear many young people never heard of any of these events.Unlike the film ""Dick"" which was a completely fictional account of Watergate for comedic purposes. this film is perfectly serious with the intention of not Hollywoodizing the facts though having Woodward and Bernstein played by Redford and Hoffman automatically does this, to some extent, particularly in the case of Redford.Nixon himself is only shown in archival footage.Since Watergate is really seen mostly through the eyes of ""Woodstein"", it is their investigation that is shown in detail. Once ""Deep Throat"" unburdens himself to Woodward, the film is essentially over but, before that, the suspense is maintained even for those viewers who know the outcome. As a result, there is a built-in lopsidedness which could not be avoided.The actors are all excellent, even the Watergate security man Frank Wills who plays himself in the film. Hal Holbrook, who plays Deep Throat is surprisingly convincing and, in appearance, not unlike Mark Felt (died only recently on December 18th, 2008.), the man who was Deep Throat (and not Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams as in ""Dick"".).Robert Redford comments on the film as it is playing but I really haven't seen much of this section. There is a second DVD in the two-DVD set which I recommend highly and this includes a short documentary about Mark Felt which makes no attempt to whitewash him or his possible motivations or the reputation of Felt's mentor, J. Edgar Hoover. Of course, it is appropriately narrated by the man who played Felt in the film, Hal Holbrook.A not-perfect film but both disks of the DVD are highly worthwhile and required viewing in my opinion.",All the President's Men
128,jay4stein79-1,Epitome,9,10 February 2006,"All the Presidents Men represents everything that was great about the grand, sweeping, American films of the 1970s. This film is among the reasons people, though I would argue incorrectly, believe the period between Easy Rider and Raging Bull to be the renaissance of American cinema (let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen, any such proclamations are invariably false). Like Chinatown or Apocalypse Now, this is, simply put, unlike any major film released in America today. Something like Good Night and Good Luck comes close, but doesn't quite achieve the audacity of releasing a film representative of the malaise sweeping a nation; Good Night attacks its targets obliquely, while Presidents takes them on head first. That's certainly something to admire. However, if that was all this film is, it wouldn't be as wonderful an achievement as it is. In addition to an overt, yet subdued, political diatribe, you find yourself face to face with, perhaps, the most realistic depiction of journalism committed to celluloid. Sure, the game of cat and mouse that takes place in the film is more akin to a detective story than your typical reporter is used to, but the fact that checking sources takes up so much of this film's running time is amazing. Pakula deserves credit for taking what could have been utterly banal and transforming it into something exciting (all of this, too, in spite of the fact that we know the end before we even start the movie). And then there's the acting... I've never much cared for Robert Redford and have often thought of him as a second-tier actor. Yeah he has starpower and charisma, but he's no Beatty, Nicholson, or Newman; heck, he's even no Reynolds or Bronson or Eastwood. He's a little too pretty and a tad too plastic. When I see him, I think California--bright, sunny, vapid. Anyway, he's excellent here, as is the always reliable Dustin Hoffman. What's great, though, are the supporting actors--Jason Robards and Hal Holbrook in particular. All the President's Men is slick, economical, Hollywood entertainment. It's not necessarily the most intelligent film, but it's definitely smart; it's also not the most aesthetically vibrant, but it has a nice feel to it. This is, simply, the apogee of Hollywood entertainment--a thrilling potboiler in the best sense of the word (I think of it and Shattered Glass in the same terms-- both excellent fun and great ways to spend a few hours).",All the President's Men
129,quinimdb,All the Presidents Men,9,28 August 2016,"""All the Presidents Men"" isn't about the water-gate scandal but the incredible journalism required to uncover it, and the overwhelming repression of the facts that Nixon achieved by abusing his power.We meet Woodward and Bernstein who seem to compliment each other so well that their boss not only assigns them to uncover water-gate together, but he nicknames them Woodstein. Bernstein has been in the business since he was 16, so he has more experience with writing than Woodward, who got to the Washington Post 9 months before the beginning of water-gate. However, Bernstein is light on facts, and he's desperate for a story so he infers more than he uses factual evidence. Woodward, on the other hand, is an honest man that has a drive to uncover the truth that is unmatched by Bernstein. They compliment each other perfectly.The film gets a bit confusing plot-wise towards the end, but what it succeeds at is making the viewer feel how Woodstein felt, and revealing the extent to which Nixon went to cover up details, as well as the sheer scale of the scandal. The way in which the film slowly unravels the scandal until Woodward realizes he and no one else is safe is perfect. The film is surprisingly comedic at many moments, such as the long shot of how Bernstein got into a certain meeting, as well as (of course) many very tense moments, including one long take that slowly, almost imperceptibly zooms in on Woodward while people gather in the background, showing Woodward's focus, as well as ours. This scene is particularly involving and exciting, despite just being a man talking on the phone, because of this reason. Anot her one is a scene in which they are trying to confirm who ""P"" is. The set up is crucial for that one. The film is chock full of these moments, they allows us feel the tension and paranoia that they did, the latter being most notable in Woodward's multiple meetings with ""Deep Throat"", which take place in an empty, dimly lit garage in which we never get a clear shot of Deep Throat's face, making him mysterious, and in one scene, scary. It's an incredibly involving movie, and it's final shot reflects it's message perfectly: two TVs playing Nixon being elected in front of and behind Woodward and Bernstein, who face each other, writing in between the two TVs. Nixon is on the outside, smiling as many people cheer around him. But at the core of this image are two people, Woodward and Bernstein, uncovering the scandal from the inside with nothing but typewriters.",All the President's Men

In reality 4 people broke into the national democratic headquarters with wire-tapping equipment in the Watergate building in Washington and what started out as a small time robbery wound up escalating rapidly as a world of deception, infiltration and downright deceit was unravelled in the ensuing investigation by two Washington Post journalists whose contrasting styles are brought to life with gifted aplomb by two Hollywood heavyweights, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.Through their eyes we see an underground world where winning by any means necessary is acceptable, where slander, libel and racist slurs are perfectly acceptable tools to beat your opponent, and that the very people that are sworn to protect us are sometimes those that we should be protected from.That this is all based on a true story is all the more terrifying and yet when watching the film you can't take your eyes off it. The script is one of the finest that there's ever been and is a perfect adaptation of the Pulitzer prize winning book. The film moves like a detective thriller and if you don't know the full story I will refrain from telling you the end, even though most people already know what happened.However, unlike many on here I can steer them right to why it was pipped to best film by ""Rocky"" at the academy awards.

133,Pratik112,A Brilliant Piece of Investigative Journalism Shown In This Movie,10,24 August 2008,"The story regarding the mysterious ""Deep Throat"" had been in the news ever since the Watergate scandal in 1972. Many had said a lot of things about the character, including the theory that this was the writer's imagination. But,I, myself, who first saw the film when it was released in 1976, before reading the book on which this is based, had said to a lot of my friends who were studying journalism with me that this character had existed and did not want to be revealed and hence the rumours. We were asked to read the book and understand it in the appropriate manner as well as learn and understand the techniques used by Bernstein and Woodward. We also had a debate whether the character existed or not. The rumours persisted until 2005 when it was finally revealed as to who ""Deep Throat"" was  FBI's the then second men, W. Mark Felt, in a Vanity Fair Magazine.In the early hours of 17 June 1972, Washington Post reporter, Bob Woodward is woken up to be informed that there had been a burglary at the opulent Watergate building in down town Washington. Soon another reporter from the same company, Carl Bernstein joins in and the two gradually begin to uncover a scandal that would rock the whole Political system and may be also the first constitution of the United States of America and leads to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.Starring Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Ned Beatty, Hal Holbrook and Jack Warden, the movie is based on the Pulitzer winning book by the same title by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and is directed by Alan J. Pakula.A movie that is definitely worthwhile watching and more so if one is aiming to become an investigative journalist. In many parts of the world, Journalists today make up some story or another so that they are able to assist the sales of the newspapers. But this is not the case here  this is real hard hitting investigative journalism at its best.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are very convincing as the two investigative journalists working for the Washington Post, Woodward and Bernstein.Conclusion: I, myself have done a bit of investigative journalism and I can say that this movie is worthwhile watching and something from which today's aspiring and potential investigative journalists can learn from.",All the President's Men
134,lucasversantvoort,The power of investigative journalism,9,5 May 2015,"All the President's Men sounds like the kind of story that wouldn't translate well to film: two journalists endlessly going door to door, making countless phone calls, sifting through files, etc. In fact, this is the very thing which makes this film so enjoyable and re-watchable: the journey, not the destination which anyone with a functioning brain would already know.In case (for some reason) you aren't familiar with the subject matter, here's a short summary (or a book). All the President's Men shows the two journalists for the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They are sent to cover the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters within the Watergate complex. Five men were arrested with bugging equipment. Though it didn't seem to be a big deal at the time, Woodward connected some dots and this led him and Bernstein to discovering one of the biggest cover-ups in American history and subsequently altering American history. Unsurprisingly, All the President's Men has since symbolized a high standard for all of journalism.One of the great decisions about this film is the lack of predictable melodrama. Merely showing the investigative parts and not including any conventional human drama for the audience to latch onto could very easily result in yawning audiences. That's why many films featuring a large investigation include scenes showing how the investigation affects the main character's increasingly troubled relation with his wife/girlfriend, such as Oliver Stone's JFK. These scenes have become rather annoyingly obligatory, so it's nice to see All the President's Men rely almost solely on the appeal of its investigation.Director Alan J. Pakula has directed a classic here and one of the reasons why is the way he frames Woodward and Bernstein, making them seem tiny and insignificant against a backdrop of large political buildings, symbolizing the powers that be, invisible conspiracies, etc. Take the scene where editor Bradley calls them to his office. There's a wide shot of the office when suddenly the two pop up in the distance and eventually walk past the camera. These kinds of shots emphasize how Woodward and Bernstein are basically two 'little' journalists who through sheer hard work and determination eventually changed the country's future.The last scene is nothing short of a celebration of the journalistic craft. Nixon is taking the Oath of Office and some of the Washington Post employees are watching it on TV. Woodward and Bernstein, not interested in the historic event, are typing away furiously at their typewriters. Cannons are fired on TV and slowly but surely the camera zooms in on Woodward and Bernstein as the sound of their typing increases in volume. As we see what they're typing, the cannon fire has been symbolically drowned out by the typing sounds and we understand the immense power that journalists are capable of using for good.",All the President's Men

It works from all angles and is entertaining above all.The subject matter is handled perfectly. Rather than make a movie about Watergate (which we all know), they writers wisely made a movie about the investigating of Watergate. We know the outcome, we know many of the key facts. That is why we can get even more enraged when Woodward and Burnstein are lied to and mislead. The social importance of this movie cannot be overstated either. Watching ATPM now seems almost like a documentary. We must keep in mind that this was made while Watergate was still fresh in the country's mind and that the divisive, partisan wounds were still healing. A gutsy move, but a successful one.All elements of this film strike the perfect tone continually. It is presented in such a way as to throw information at you from all angles, confusing and jumbled, with lies and half-truths woven in everywhere. This is done to give the viewer the same paranoid sense of futility that the reporters on this case truly must have had.Also of note is the fact that this film is very neutral.

137,Doublej20005,A Truly Intriguing Drama,9,24 January 2021,"Watergate is such an interesting subject matter to me, so a film about the topic is one that I'd always be interested in. In that regard, this film had a head start in winning me over, but even if I wasn't already intrigued by the concept, I would have loved this. Between the fantastic lead performances from Redford and Hoffman, the sharp, witty and enjoyable dialogue and the strong direction, pretty much every technical element worked to perfection. The lighting and cinematography felt strangely immersive and helped keep me thoroughly engaged in a fairly slow-paced film. I'm not entirely sure why this worked so well for me - it just totally gripped me from start to finish and didn't let go once. There were a couple of lines that felt a bit forced, mainly from the people that the duo were interviewing, and the ending was a tad abrupt, if still really well done. But regardless, this was a fantastic film, and definitely one worth watching the day that a corrupt Republican President is kicked out of office.",All the President's Men
138,emryse,"Brilliantly Made! Not Sure About the Story Though,",7,8 February 2021,"This movie is a masterclass on pacing, lighting and cinematography. To be honest almost every technical part of the film is done to perfection and I'm not saying that the acting was bad either, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman were superb, I think that what let this story down really was the story itself. The script is good, don't get me wrong, but the story is a bit plain, it's an interesting scandal but all the film can really do is show us these two reporters driving to different people's homes and asking them questions and no matter how good the directing is, the dialogue, the acting, the camerawork, the story itself just isn't that interesting. If you have an interest in this particular scandal and how it was uncovered by the media then you can definitely get a good time from it but if you just want to sit back, relax and watch a film...There are definitely better options.TL;DR : Good for people who like Watergate or want to learn about how to make a film look good, not great for some casual viewing",All the President's Men
139,DavidAllenUSA,All The President's Men (1975) starring Robert Redford is interesting but not wonderful,7,16 November 2010,"All The President's Men (1975 Warner Brothers) starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman is a monument to Hollywood movie making at it's most skillful, an extremely well crafted movie. Nonetheless, it says nothing at all of importance about a monumentally important event and subject, the fall of the Richard Nixon presidency in 1974.The movie pretends to be serious and intelligent, but it is neither. It doesn't deserve the honor of being selected to the American Film Institute (AFI) Best 100 Films List.Anti-Nixon Hollywood people of great fame and technical talent made a very successful movie about the 1972 Watergate burglary news coverage from the Washington Post newspaper, and about newspaper articles written by Post newspaper reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein from 1972-74 while the two reporters were still junior staffers on the Washington Post in the early 1970's.The movie, directed by Alan Pakula, is very, very well made and especially well acted.Main stars Redford and Hoffman were and still are riveting to watch from start to stop, and so are the superstar supporting actors, including but not limited to Jason Robards, Martin Balsom, Jack Warden, Ned Beatty, Stephen Collins, Meredith Baxter (aka Baxter-Bernie), and Jane Alexander. Superb acting by heavyweight actors who deliver the goods at all times.So what's the problem? No story at all. That's the problem.Well....a USA government was toppled and a USA President ended his tenure in office in disgrace, and many of his top assistants went to jail, of course.But those things and others of importance were not what All The President's Men (1975 Warner Bros.) was about.The movie was about two ambitious and energetic newspaper reporters covering the ""story."" The big highlight of the ""thriller"" movie comes when ""Deep Throat,"" the tattletale contact Woodward (Redford) meets in building garages, always seen in half shadows (played well by Hal Holbrook), tells Woodward (Redford) the bad guys Woodward is trying to expose may try to kill the investigator reporters.In other words, the movie claims Nixon's people were trying to kill young staffers from the Washington Post newspaper covering the Watergate ""story.""Is that true?Well....true or false, it's dramatic, and makes a good thriller movie plot.The movie accuses the Republicans who faced the Washington Post reporting and articles written by Woodward and Bernstein of plotting murder. The movie's intent of defaming and demonizing the then (1975) recently fallen Nixon administration is made clear and symbolized by this claim (never proved or substantiated...ever). The many scenes of Robert Redford (playing Bob Woodward, who is much less handsome than Redford) looking over his shoulder for possible murderers are chilling, and intended to be. Hollywood thriller/chiller movie making at it's best, one has to admit.The ""Redford looking over his shoulder into the darkness"" scenes makes for a tense, nervous, ""thrilling"" atmosphere dear to the hearts of movie goers. All The President's Men (1975 Warner Bros.) starring Robert Redford is a movie made by well paid Hollywood heavyweights who were paid to make a high quality political propaganda movie. They took the money of the people who paid them off, delivered a well made movie, and ran.It's a ""take the money and run"" movie. Not noble, but not unusual either, sadly.----------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

140,Embley,"redford, hoffman and watergate - what could be better?",10,10 May 1999,i don't know why i love this film so much - i first saw it one afternoon at my grandmother's house on tv and i was sucked in immediately.  i've watched it countless times since and there is something about 1970's political thrillers that really hits the nail on the head.  this one has everything you could want in a political thriller and it is based on fact! unmissable.,All the President's Men
141,midas-jacobs,"A movie that deserves a re-watch, and a re-watch, and a re-watch...",10,16 October 2016,"""All the President's Men"" is about two journalists who try to uncover details from the Watergate scandal.""All the President's Men"" was brilliantly directed by Alan J. Pakula. He really did an amazing job at directing. He created a realistic movie. And he looked out for the details. When a character is further away from the camera, the voice of said character is way more quiet than the voice of someone standing right in front of the camera for example. Or when a plane flies by, and the characters have to yell, so the other one understands them. But the realism doesn't end there. He used some techniques to immerse you into the movie. An example of this is when the camera is focused on two different things at the same time. Mostly with the one thing being right in front of the camera and the other being in the background. The technique is not used a lot on today's standards, but directors like Quentin Tarrantino use it once in a while. But normally they choose to focus on two characters. In this movie Alan J. Pakula decided to make the camera focus on one character, but the other thing is completely random. Well, not completely random. The other thing was most of the time a distraction, to show how hard it is to concentrate at the given time. This only makes you feel like you are there right with the characters and it gives a very immersive feel to it. Another cool detail was the use of wide angle shots. This was used to make it feel like you were being watched, which fits the theme of the movie perfectly. He is also a very good visual director. Like I've just said, he uses a lot of wide shots. These shots were always beautifully composed. There were a couple of scenes I liked in particular. The scenes where Woodward goes to meet his informant. The use of lighting and color were on point. The wide shots looked stunning. But not only the wide shots. In the close ups the shadows were used creatively, which gave an amazing effect. Another scene that visually stood out to me was the scene in the elevator. The characters partially hidden in shadows made the shot look very good. These were just the ones that I personally found amazing to look at, but that's mostly because I very much like the use of shadow in scenes. Alan J. Pakula also used long takes in which the camera managed to capture every character in a beautiful way. You'd expect that, when the camera is moving, not all characters would be positioned in a good spot, but because of the brilliance of Alan J. Pakula, this is what happened. The pacing was also really good.Now that that's out of the way, let's go over to the actors. There were two protagonists in the story Bernstein and, the previous named Woodward. Woodward was played by Robert Redford. I think that this is his best performance that I've seen from him, even though the Oscars seem to disagree with me. He absolutely deserved an Oscar for this role. His dedication to the role payed of and he felt so natural. The same goes for his colleague, Dustin Hoffman. He too deserved an Oscar, or at least a nomination, for his natural performance. But these were just the main performances. The supporting cast was really good. The members of the CREEP really showed fear in their eyes and were very convincing.The screenplay was also fantastic. It was written with such care. The information that you needed to figure out everything was there, but just not told right in your face. The dialogues were realistic. First we see men talk things through, before something relevant to the plot happens. It doesn't go straight to the point as in your average movies. No, they take time to set the scene up. The dialogue is also intriguing and you want to know what the person is going to say next. I've read in the trivia section of IMDb that Hoffman and Redford learned each others lines so they could interrupt each other during a conversation. And they did. It paid of very well. this only made the movie getting more realistic. The characters were not developed in a way that they tell you: ""oh his parents died"". (This is not in the movie, just an example) In ""All the President's Men"", they do this in subtle ways. You can see immediately that Bernstein is a perfectionist and that Woodward is a realist. Their characters are developed by actions and subtle things, rather than someone with a big red arrow above their head yelling from the roof which character traits each character has. I've said that the screenplay was written with care, and with this I mean that they really watched out with what the characters said in which scene. If the character said something else, the scene would've lost it's power, which is not a good thing.If you don't get it: I love this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. The acting and directing were absolutely on point. The attention for detail is remarkable and the writing is intriguing. This movie is going up on my favorite movie list. This movie get's a 10/10",All the President's Men
142,danjakubik,Talky historical drama-thriller about the Watergate cover up,9,17 August 2008,"A first rate script and cast come together to make an engaging film based on the book ""All The President's Men"". Long on realism, intelligence and logic, however, short on suspense. Almost entirely a dialogue and character driven film. From the perspective of two Washington Post reporters played convincingly by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman. Slow pacing helps create a realistic feel for how long a complicated story about powerful people can take to eventually come together. The teletype ending provides effective story closure without resorting to a dramatization of a well known historical event in modern American history.Nominated for 8 Academy Awards. Winner of 4 Oscars including Best Adapted Screenplay.88 / 100",All the President's Men
143,knucklebreather,What is it?,8,19 July 2010,"""All the President's Men"" is, of course, an apparently factual depiction of Woodward and Bernstein's famous investigation that broke open the Watergate scandal between 1972 and 1974 (although the film just covers the initial reporting up to tying senior White House aids to a secret slush fund). As a movie, however, it's not so easy to pin down what exactly it is.It's not a typical Hollywood thriller, despite essentially having thriller pacing. It's not a detective story, since the film is clearly made with the expectation that every member of the audience already knows what the reporters are going to find out. It's not exactly a documentary, so perhaps this is close to being a docudrama. To the credit of the movie, they don't do typical Hollywood things like invent a romantic subplot or add fanciful elements of government assassins coming after the reporters, as one would imagine Hollywood would be inclined to do. This is just 2 hours of reporters reporting, no attempt was made at making this movie include ""something for everyone"", which was probably a good idea.Robert Redford steals the show as Woodward, pure and simple. In many ways his natural acting (and I'm sure, his good looks) smooth over the plot which is difficult to follow due to its sheer complexity. Redford is always sure you feel drawn in even if you can't follow exactly which name he's talking about in a given scene. With an actor who didn't make nearly everyone like him, this movie could have been classified as a boring, dated relic and not of much interest to modern audiences. As it is, though, the movie is still very much worth watching if you have even the vaguest interest in Watergate or the 1970s in general, and a lot of that is due to Redford's work here.The rest of the film is okay, providing a decent depiction of some parts of the Watergate scandal. I suppose the entire thing was too complicated to ever fit into a single movie, but as this film as basically become the official version most people believe, it is a bit troubling that the movie doesn't spend a single moment addressing why any of what's going on is going on. The movie leaves us with this impression of government agents being evil just to get their guy reelected, and reporters and government whistle-blowers exposing it just because they want the truth to be known, when in reality everyone, from the editors at the Post to Deep Throat, had much more nuanced motivations (although only a select few could have guessed at Deep Throat's motivations when this movie was made). Still, 2 of those people (Woodward in Bernstein) were involved in making the movie.Political concerns aside, it's a decent piece of cinema, and a wonderful time capsule of what America was feeling at this time. If this sort of thing interests you at all, it is very much worth a rental.",All the President's Men
144,teejayniles2345,"Thirty years later, WATERGATE is still horrifying",10,24 May 2002,"This non-fiction feature (really not meant to be documentary-like) deserved a BEST PICTURE award since it remains truly a ""Mom, country, Apple pie"" classic.  The director knows how to make us edgy without the ""conspiracy"" bitter-tastedness that such a film could have had.  ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN shows how journalism isn't about fabrication; instead it's all about asking the RIGHT questions and pounding the pavement in search of reliable sources! This film is an amazing trip back to a simpler era, if you'd call it that. The two lead characters have to work out a compromise of working styles and collaborate to ""get the story right.""  A great illustration of teamwork and how strong egos don't always have to compete when a bigger goal predominates.  A film well worth watching and learning about perspective and the sociocultural environment that was Washington, D.C. in 1972.  Deserving of many 10 *'s.

145,frankiehudson,"Great actors, great story, great profession. Great film.",10,13 February 2005,"This superb, engrossing film starts with a cloudy, white screen; presumably a depressing sky over Washington DC back in 1972. It's all doom and gloom. Then, suddenly, just when you were relaxing BANG BANG BANG The tremendous noise sounds like a shot from a rifle, and it makes you jump. But it's not a rifle, of course; it's the sound of a typewriter bar striking what turns out to be a blank sheet of paper; the major theme of the film is the power of journalism and the (type) written word. It is June 1, 1972.One of the primary motifs of this brilliant Pakula film is the production of text, and this is back in the days of typewriters and paper, lots of it. Woodward and Bernstein are often shown at their desks working on text. It is the Washington Post, after all, and it was their text that destroyed Richard Nixon.The film is also about detective work and you get to see investigative research carried out at the Library of Congress (with a brilliant shot where the camera withdraws from above, the two at work on enormous batches of library slips, drawing right up to the ceiling  how did they film that?  until the two almost disappear, just two tiny people sat at a desk, buried in detail).The music is by David Shire and is superb. Everything else is brilliant, too.There are 'crazy Cubans', crooked attorneys, district attorneys, and brilliant editorial team at the Washington Post, and all the drama of exposing corruption in the White House. Strangely, there is no Richard Nixon in this film, other than on newsreel footage, appearing at Congress, etc. The story is told from the viewpoint of Woodward and Bernstein and their newspaper.It is a truly great film, typical of the 1970s.",All the President's Men
146,suzy q123,A modern classic,10,17 May 2001,"One of the few films to make journalism romantic and exciting- at least journalism that is based in reality. If you ever want to feel like you know what happened with Watergate, even though none of us ever will, rent this film. Featuring great performances by Hoffman and Redford, a tight script and terrific music, you will not be disappointed......",All the President's Men
147,maxastree,Moderately dramatic results,5,6 June 2016,"Hi everybody, in case you didn't know - this film is overrated.Scriptwriter William Goldman's name is so often bandied about or name-dropped as the par excellence of great screen writing, and this film is supposed to be an example of how creative and subversive the seventies were in film, euphemistically dubbed Hollywood's ""second golden era"" by movie historians, but mostly because the eighties were so disposable and crass.Goldman's writing is definitely in shape, and he has a great ear for dialogue, but there's little in this film to really engage a viewer; there's two reasons the film isn't going to impress modern audiences, and I'll outline them here:Firstly, 80% of the film details failed and attempted interviews with faces or just telephone voices around Washington leading up to the Watergate scandal, and they are just what they are - conversations, anonymous office memorandums, conversations-whilst-driving, conversations-on-peoples-doorways, conversations-outside-government- buildings. Everyone of course either has fears for their identity, lies outright or is just too vague to attribute in a proper news vehicle, and basically the sheer repetitiveness of the scenes becomes stifling, rather than growing in dramatic tension in any meaningful way.The second reason this film doesn't hold up much today is because times have changed so radically. Discovering a politicians connections, work contacts, previous relationships, investments and properties can be done by anyone, whereas back then audiences were supposed to see the film as a struggle by Bob Woodward (AKA: The Little Guy) taking on Washington . . . and . . . winning!!!My last reservation about this film is that (to it's credit) it explores both the hypocrisy and abuses of power in so-called democratic societies, but at the same time rewards the viewer with inherently bogus ideals about the power of the individual. In the 2010's, after decades of deregulation and stage-managed electoral campaigns, all of which are hired or paid off by corporate elites, its completely obvious to any thinking person that the ideals of modern democracy are a sham, and that this film is about fairy-tale wish fulfillment, not the power of investigative journalism. To clarify, on any given policy debate issue, the actual power of the citizenry to effect the outcome process is zero, regardless of their strong support, indifference, or alarm. So, in effect, this film makes theater out of the idea of greater individual liberty when no such liberties make genuine effect for our common good.As a final note, this film never really shows any significant characters outside of the white male demographic anywhere at the Washington Post, let alone anywhere operating in Washington, with a few female office assistants aside. I would call it a well written film, with a few excellent scenes featuring an anonymous source (famously nicknamed Deep Throat) and basically a lack of narrative range and of course a predestined outcome. Some things age badly, and this film definitely has, I would recommend reading the screenplay alone if Watergate is a pet interest of yours, or the so-called ""political thriller"" genre.",All the President's Men
148,hedgehog-10,A superb script adaptation.,10,21 April 2000,"A superbly adapted script prevents this film from becoming bogged down. Made not that long after the actual scandal, the film still retains the suspense of seeking the story before your rival newspapers and other media companies.",All the President's Men
149,inioi,Unfortunately this could not happen nowadays.,9,28 November 2015,"This is why this movie is a rare gem: At that time, all the system worked and the President had no other choice but to resign.This is remarkably portrayed by the script and all the staff: Alan J.Pakula who was an admirable director, Redford, Hoffman...all the supporting cast was very accurate. Hal Holbrook deserves special mention in his ""Deep Throat"" rol.the plot seems taken from a spy movie but it was real.Can you imagine nowadays an investigation which concludes with the current President resignation...? i don't think so. The judiciary and the president were not so connected (bought) as they are now. Today's democracy is a myth. This movie is a prefect example of how an impeachment should work. Nowadays not even reach that: a little reprimand and that would be all...The film was made in the most similar way about how actually the events occurred, and keeps you in a sort of suspense which goes progressively increasing.9/10",All the President's Men
150,enmussak,Big Brother,9,20 December 2002,"All the President's Men is a case in which the story is so compelling, that it is virtually impossible to make a poor movie.  The project also wasn't hurt by Redford and Hoffman, who played the parts beautifully.  I really enjoyed that this story was told solely from the perspective of Woodward and Bernstein, and the White House and its staff was completely unseen.  This added the needed ""mysterious"" villain aspect of the story.  It also made the enemy into a force, rather than reduce it to individual people.  Quite a powerful force too.  If you feel the magnitude of what these two young journalists are going up against, you'll love this movie.  Very intense.  9/10",All the President's Men
151,dgrahamwatson,All the presidents crooks!,10,9 July 2005,"We now know that it was the FBI's number two man and J Edger Hoover loyalist W Mark Felt who fingered Nixon!I'd recommend this movie, but with warnings attached to this! Firstly, Redford and Hoffman were at their best during the 1970's and their performances don't disappoint, I'm sure that they also depicted their respected characters Woodward and Bernstein very well too as they both come across as very believable as reporters or at least the stereotype version. The unkept tardy look, untidy apartments, smoking, corduroy trousers, fast food and neck ties hanging down with unbuttoned collar an shirt  you get the picture!Also, For any foreigner who is interested in American political science, there are about six historical events that dominate US history. To most objective historians the declaration of independence, the US civil war and it's aftermath, the 'New Deal', the defeat of the axis powers in WWII, civil rights or even the collapse of the Soviet empire and the Berlin wall would be tops. However to the American baby-boomer generation, it is JFK's assassination, anti-Vietnam war movement, Woodstock, Richard Nixon's forced resignation and Bill Clinton's come from behind win against George Bush in 1992. Therefore 'All the president's men' is a nostalgic trip down memory lane!Although the movie is clearly dated, (imagine being a journalist today without a desktop computer, a lap top computer, email, and a cell phone) it does entertain and the pacing I think is effective as it portrays the painstaking work required for investigate journalism. Redford and particularly Hoffman are believable as reporters and the movie is supported by some of the finest character actors about at the time. Hal Holbrook and Jason Robards jockey for the third spot honors with Holbrook probably edging it as the mysterious deep throat. He steals the scenes in the garage. I think there are three times he and Woodward meet and they are some of the most compelling scenes of the whole movie. Alan Pakulas style of directing certainly hit the sweet spot here. Although it's well paced and it keeps your attention, the film flounders at various levels because the whole unraveling of events and the various connections between the burglars link to CREEP (campaign to reelect the president) and their link to members of Nixons inner circle is not clear. Consequently, the movie ends what appears to be in January of 1973 but Nixon resigned 18 months later? They should have jumped forward to that point before the movie finished. The viewer is left completely confused and frustrated. Although having Knowledge of the Watergate break in and the Nixon resignation it's impossible to keep up with what is going on. Names such as Liddy, Hunt, Mitchell, Magruder and Dean are banded about and come up all the time but often you don't know who they are? Some narration would have been very helpful! However, although Woodward and Bernstein deserve credit for keeping the story alive when nobody else was interested but it in reality was the tapes that finally buried Nixon. Once the special prosecutor and the public were able to hear is voice talking about the investigation his presidency was finished, without the tapes he probably would have survived.How much of the facts portrayed in the film are fiction I suppose nobody will ever know? If I ever run into Woodward and Bernstein I'll ask them! Also for anybody who's curious on who Woodwards 'deep throat' character is they will be disappointed, as it is not revealed in any way, although that is academic now. Check the movie out!",All the President's Men
152,ConsistentlyFalconer,I could watch this political conspiracy thriller every day.,10,11 July 2015,"All The President's Men (1976)One of my top five films. If you're a fan of political conspiracy films in particular, this is how it's done. But of course if you're not, I give you my usual advice: FORGET ABOUT GENRE and watch it anyway - let yourself get sucked in to this excellent film. Direction, cinematography, editing, not to mention superb performances by every single cast member from top to bottom...Contains one of my very favourite moments in cinema: the haunted voice of a man who knows he's been rumbled saying ""My God..."", and you know our heroes are onto something big!It's a wonderful time capsule, too - these days the idea of a political party bugging its opponents isn't in the slightest bit outlandish. Back then it was horrifying. Plus, the legwork that Woodward and Bernstein have to do to get their story - no internet searches back then! My only criticism is that it ends far too abruptly. I would have loved it to have gone on for another hour or so to finish things off properly.Verdict: A truly masterful representation of a truly earth-shattering story.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",All the President's Men
153,fishermensmell,Follow the money...,6,25 February 2021,"A knowledge of the Watergate scandal isn't a prerequisite for watching this, as the film is not about the scandal per se, but the journalistic sleuthing that uncovered it. And yet the filmmakers quite reasonably assume a topical understanding of the surrounding events from the contemporary audience. They should be applauded for not patronizing the audience by filling in too much of this information. However, in 2021, swaddled in my utter ignorance of 1970s US politics, it does become a handicap. Watching two men grasping in the dark, when you yourself are in the dark, is not much fun. The movie's pacing is such that at times it moves very slowly before flinging a flurry of names and linkages at you before retreating back into the shadows. I was left with a sense that more important and interesting events and repercussions were taking place off-screen. This does become tedious as the film moves forward.That said, the highlight of the film is seeing Hoffman and Redford applying their logic, using stealth and coercion to eliminate the possibilities and zone in on the truth. However, these scenes are few and far between and the rest of the running time is made up of fairly stolid political drama and intrigue and newsroom scenes. Possibly the film is a victim of its own success, as I sense its influence on all sorts of TV and film, meaning that certain scenes and characters have lost their impact and feel rather humdrum (the pot plant on the window sill; the ""Deep Throat"" character; the compromised duplicity of some informers, typewriters clacking for exposition etc.)Overall, a good film, but I don't know that it has stood the test of time.",All the President's Men
154,andrew7,"Tense, Brilliant, and Endlessly Watchable",9,14 January 2002,"I'm a Watergate junkie.  I admit it.  In fact, I'm a Nixon junkie.  So, obviously, I love this movie to bits.  But apart from feeding my thirst for Watergate, this also happens to be a very well-made film.The script is marvellous, for instance.  There is some really great dialogue in here, and the focus is much broader than simply Watergate.  I was watching the film the other day and noting with admiration the way the film provides its own historical context so well.  There they are, discussing the very ABM treaty that our current president has just decided to scrap.  The fact that the script takes such pains to make the viewer aware of what are the ""big stories"" at the Post (especially before the Watergate story becomes a big story itself) add immensely to the realism the picture.  Why would the Foreign Editor, for instance, care about Watergate.  He wouldn't, and in this film, he doesn't.  But he doesn't act like the minor character he so obviously is.  In those meetings, he's a major character.  Think about it... if you were the Foreign Editor at the Post, you'd probably think and act like a major character too.  It's details like that... making sure a character behaves as his real-world counterpart might, even when it doesn't directly serve the story, that makes this picture so much broader than Watergate.Because at root, it isn't about Watergate.  It's about Woodward and Bernstein's investigation of Watergate.  Huge difference.  The important details become, not setting the context of the White House where these things happened, but setting the context of the Post where the investigation took place.  The story of Watergate can be told in many ways (there have been some great documentaries, and Stone's ""Nixon"" touches on the subject), but this is the only way to tell the story of the ""Woodstein"" invesitgation.It's easy to praise this film by talking about how important it is, but I think many reviewers often fail to mention just how good a movie it really is.",All the President's Men
155,puttputtk,a great history lesson and an even better movie,10,24 June 2010,"All the Presidents Men (1977)5 word summary Reporters help uncover Watergate scandal This film is a history lesson put in a much more entertaining way than any teacher could. Really it doesn't seem like the film should be entertaining even while watching it, but it just flows so nicely. The pace never really slows, it just stays interesting, almost like it's a thriller more than a drama. When you put 2 of the greatest actors in film history together with such a well written script and a director that can get such great emotion and performances out of scripts and actors such as in this or Sophie's Choice its not really a surpriseIt won 4 Oscars that year, however I almost feel It was cheated. Personally, I think All the Presidents Men is a better film than Rocky and should have also taken best picture. Then again I like Network more than Rocky and Taxi Driver more than all of them, so really it wasn't a great year for the Osacars. I also feel it deserved Best Director over Rocky as well.This is one of the few movies that are based on a true story that are better because its true. Anyone who wants a entertaining history lesson, and anyone who likes Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford should watch this film. It is one of the best films ever made. It's very informative and very entertaining which isn't very common in the film world. 10/10",All the President's Men
156,joeravioli,I wasn't ready. Not at all.,7,15 November 2015,"I was not at all prepared for All the President's Men. I had picked it up from the library a few weeks earlier with the misguided assumption that I would have time to watch it in the next few days. A veritable onslaught of tests, assignments, and social events almost denied me the opportunity to see the film, but I managed to cobble a few hours together on a Friday night. By then, I was exhausted, settling in for what I hoped would be a passive two hours of fun.Boy, was I wrong.All the President's Men hit me harder than a fiery cannonball. As the film spiralled on, I realized (to a considerable amount of shock) that I actually needed to pay attention, that if I didn't keep track of all the names and titles as they flew in and out of my soggy cerebrum, the film would be little more than a waste of time. Pakula wasn't about to serve his film up on a silver platter.All The President's Men depicts the single-handed crusade of two journalists at the Washington Post, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in unearthing the truth of the Watergate burglary. I'll warn you, it's riotously fast-paced, perhaps the most fast-paced film I have ever seen. If you so much as blink, you might miss something extremely important, and cease to understand subsequent events. The two reporters are unceasingly on the trail, piecing things together at amazing speed.That, if anything, makes this film a good film: it forces you to engage your mind. Pakula assumes an impressive level of intelligence on the part of the audience (or at least some background knowledge) that many directors deny as even a possibility. But I personally believe that it was a bit too much for a first encounter with Watergate. The film was released in 1976, while the event happened in 1972, only four years before. Thus, the 1976 audience would remember the events, having lived through them, and most importantly, would recognize the names of the people involved. I, as a 90s kid, didn't really have this advantage, and floundered hopelessly as a result.Despite this, the film does have a general accessibility to the average film-goer in terms of acting, cinematography, and dialogue. Redford and Hoffman are undeniably excellent as Woodward and Bernstein, bringing a violent energy to each of their characters in their unshakable pursuit of the truth. All their actions in the film are for one goal, and one goal only: to get the story, and to get it right. There is a small degree of unevenness in Woodward's character in that he shifts between passive and aggressive too often to be unnoticeable, but Bernstein's character is defined and executed excellently. Also, Jason Robards is perfect as the tough-talking, gruff American newspaperman.The cinematography, while uneven, is often excellent. The scenes in the parking garage and the Washington Post headquarters are done very well, each conveying an entirely different atmosphere, and doing it well. I did notice some strange issues with focus, in that half of a frame would be in focus while the other half would not, which was very off-putting and strange.The dialogue was gorgeous. Modern films aren't able to convey the inherent fallibility of language as a human tool, and always forget that humans are inconsistent in speech. In this film, the characters make mistakes all over the place with their dialogue, and actually say the word ""um"", which was definitely a pleasant surprise. The language gives you the feeling that you're listening to real people, not actors.I give All the President's Men a 6/10 in absentia of actually having seen the film. I'll explain: I saw the film, but I had only the slightest idea of what was happening, and thus, haven't really seen the film. I had no idea that the film was going to end when it did, and when it did, I was more confused than I had ever been after watching a film. I'm almost certain that the film is good, but can't be sure. I guess I'll have to watch it again.",All the President's Men

158,mikepwong,Exciting Investigative Journalism,9,28 May 2003,"Rating: 9 out of 10. Directed by Alan Pakula. Robert Redford does a great job playing the role of journalist Bob Woodward. The more talented Dustin Hoffman gives an excellent performance as Carl Bernstein. I once heard that this movie is a good guide for 'how-to' and 'how-not-to' conduct investigative journalism.The two journalists team up right after the Watergate burglars get arrested. They follow their own clues, but these tips only lead to dead ends, the puzzle is complicated. However, these Watergate burglars seem to be linked to the Republican Party and possibly to the White House.Alan Pakula does an incredible job of keeping the movie suspenseful and intriguing. As the story progresses, the viewer feels deeply involved in how these two journalists uncover the conspiracy. The contrast between the two main characters adds to the movie. Redford as Woodward has a relaxed and charming approach, while Hoffman as Bernstein is more persistent and sometimes daring.Woodward has a White House contact played by Hal Holbrook named 'Deep Throat' that he meets in 'Cloak and Dagger' style in a dark undercover parking lot, we never see his face clearly and he speaks in a rough rasping voice. 'Deep Throat' provides Woodward information in an indirect manner and keeps the journalists on the right track. This type of informant character has been replicated many times over in suspense movies and TV, especially on the TV series 'The X-Files'. Jason Robarbs as Bill Bradlee, editor of 'The Washington Post' performs remarkably as boss of the newspaper. Constantly reminding Woodward and Bernstein to find good solid evidence, but he also gets frustrated when none of the informants will go on the record with what they know. Robarbs won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for this role. I never get bored with watching this movie. If you have not seen it before, treat yourself to a viewing.",All the President's Men
159,dave fitz,great journalistic thriller,10,2 August 2000,"All The President's Men, directed by Alan J. Pakula, tells the story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They were the Washington Post reporters whose uncovering of the Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon. It is very entertaining and features two of the top stars of the 70's: Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein. Jason Robards won an Oscar for his portrayal of Post editor Ben Bradlee.
Woodward and Bernstein report on the original break-in at the Watergate Hotel and their investigation reveals a deeper scandal involving some of the most powerful Republicans in Washington. They are helped by the mysterious source, Deep Throat (Hal Holbrook). This movie features strong performances by Redford, Hoffman and the large supporting cast.

160,politfilm,Does Watergate sound familiar?,10,19 April 2019,"During the U.S. presidential campaign of 1972, Washington Post reporters Karl Bernstin and Bob Woodward investigated the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.An anonymous source from the FBI, nicknamed Deep Throat, began to leak information indicating there is something much more sinister hiding behind the scenes, but in the beginning journalists found it hard to belive and grasp the scale of it all. Through their investigation, the case of an ordinary burglary has grown into one of the biggest political scandals that have ever shook the U.S.It turned out that the Committee to Re-elect the President (Richard Nixon) has engaged in serious political dirty tricks, harassment, espionage, etc. and that the Justice Department, the FBI and the CIA are involved in the cover-up. Scandal continued to unravel until it became clear that in the whole thing involved highest officials of the White House, including President Richard Nixon personally.Movie All the President's Men was made in 1976, four years after the outbreak of the Watergate scandal and only two years after Richard Nixon was forced to resign because of this (and thus becoming the only U.S. president who resigned). The film received a great public attention, made a huge political influence in the United States, set new standards of journalism and became one of the most commercially successful political films in history.In the scene when the two journalists are going towards the house of one of the key people in the scandal, one of them says: ""All these neat, little houses and all these nice, little streets... It's hard to believe that something's wrong with some of those little houses."" to which the other replies: ""No, it isn't.""

161,yellowtail_tuna,Curiosity about the behind the door,10,26 June 2020,"While it deals with the Watergate scaldal, the film itself is not really political, probably because the two lead chracters are not political at all. They are just young men who are eager to know the truth.Everytime they try to step in to the truth, the door always closes in front of them, literally or figuratively. That make us curious about the behind the door. There are certainly cover-up operations that are going on at this very moment.When I watched it for the first time, It was hard for me to follow the plot detail. One reason is that there is a flood of name, name, and name... (especially for me being not a native English speaker, the names are not easy to memorize). But this film is interesting enough to have urged me to do a careful rewatch.While there is little character development throughout the film, the two men are very attractive. Bob is manly and resentful, and Carl is shrewd and persuasive. There is a scene where we see the contrast, when they ask a female colleague to get information from her ex-boyfriend.The cinematography is just beatiful. I find every scene very well controlled, in its composition, movement, and lighting. Although I don't know if it was real, I find the 70s Washington Post office is pretty stylish, with desk sides painted green, blue and red. And typewriters have the symbolic role as the weapons to fight the biggest conspiracy in the U.S. history.",All the President's Men
162,dsa_ca,Creating thrill out of a cold turkey,10,2 July 2008,"The Watergate scandal is one of the most definitive moments in American history. It was an event of great seismic proportion which saw President Nixon resigning due to the involvement of white house officials in the burglary. But to be frank, it was a small time third rate burglary and corruption scandal, it did not included covert killings or direct threats to anyone. So, it was fairly difficult task to come up with thriller-drama out of this one, along with keeping it true to the real events.Alan J. Pakula succeeds in creating a suspense thriller kind of drama which does not deviate from the actual events. But most of the credit for this masterpiece goes to the two lead actors Dustin Hoffman & Robert Redford for their sincere performance as Carl Bernstein & Bob Woodward, the Washington post journalists who stuck the story and let did not let the burglary slip at the back burner of the national scene in America. Another important character in this episode of American history who has become a cult over the years was Woodward's garage freak source for the confirmation of the story 'Deepthroat'. As his true identity to the outer world was just revealed a couple of years back in 2005, his characterization in the movie was most important as audiences around the world would be more eager to know about him and his role in the case. The movie succeeds in showing 'Deepthroat' as a dark, secretive but helpful person. The scenes involving the interaction between 'Deepthroat' and Woodward in the garage parking are the most thrilling and dark in the movie. The murky garage scenes raise the intensity of film and succeed in capturing the viewing public's imagination. The two journalists were never actually threatened, but they do get credible information about the threat to there lives. Hence in the movie, the director has to show heightened sense of silent drama to portrait the effect of the undeniable threat to there life. These succeed in creating suspicion and bit of fear in the minds of the audience about the live of the journalists.The movie performs well in each department and manages to portray credible characters and sets which also adds to the political thrill. This is the biggest plus for this film as its every scene smells as real as possible.",All the President's Men

This is a true ensemble piece with wonderful performances throughout.  The script is certainly literate, thoroughly researched, and when allowed to be heard without distracting interspersements and ponderous camera angles, is gripping. 
However, Alan J. Pakula's direction is so bad, that I consider the film as a whole to be wildly over-rated.  He takes a story that really should be told chronologically -- as it was written -- and decides to just slice and dice events according to his muse.  The result is slow, more than a bit pedantic, and disjointed.  Also, despite the strong performances, Pakula keeps the viewer at two arms' lengths and the distance also hinders enjoyment.

166,spirit11,"Great Writing, Great Film",8,11 November 2000,"In this movie, the story is truly the star. The writing is absolutely outstanding, and deserving of the Oscar it received. And it is particularly appropriate since the film focuses on two (now famous) writer/journalists, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post.This film creates a fascinating suspense story that feels like it punches you in the gut. You want to cheer Woodward and Bernstein on, but you also realize that the story is true, and when they succeed it will drag the country through one of the worst periods of our political history. You almost wish you had the ear of President Nixon at the time to say, ""Don't do it!"" As the story unfolds, no one will say anything, no one will go on the record, the answer to every question seems to ask ten more questions at the same time. There are a list of players in the story that is a mile long, and there are times you wish you had a scorecard to keep everyone straight.The acting I found to be a bit disappointing. Dustin Hoffman (as Bernstein) is particularly frustrating to me, with a pattern to his speech that often makes it difficult to understand what he is saying. Robert Redford (as Woodward) does better, though neither of the two seem to provide the dramatics that the story does. I don't know what I was looking for, but it seems as if I wanted them to be as drawn into the situation as I was. When they are told by Deep Throat that their lives may be in danger they seem surprised, where I was thinking to myself, ""Get a clue! Didn't you guys know that?!?!."" But perhaps that is because they didn't expect the worst from the government, and it is only as a result of Watergate and what these two reporters discovered that I ""DO"" expect the worst! I don't believe that Jason Robards was onscreen enough to create a true persona for his character of Washington Post Editor Ben Bradlee, so I am surprised that he won the Best Supporting Actor in 1977. He deserves an Oscar for his acting skills, but I don't believe this is the film that was the standout demanding that award.Parents, be prepared for some language in the film, though not as much as many films as of the year 2000. One odd note on that point -- I watched the film on American Movie Classics and found it odd that they would edit out language such as ""bull****"", but left in the word ""godd***"", which is used repeatedly in the film.

168,xterminal,"Confusing, but it's supposed to be",7,19 February 2001,"All the President's Men (Alan Pakula, 1976)We have met the enemy, and they is more ours than we realized they was. Pakula's fact-based look at the way Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) uncovered the story behind the Watergate break-in is a classic piece of filmmaking that's influenced almost every, if not every, piece of film and television dealing with journalism that's come since in America. Most, thankfully, are a little more coherent than this, but the confusion factor doesn't make All the President's Men any less a film.Much of what allows All the President's Men to straddle the line between confusing mush and classic filmmaking is in that everpresent devil, the details. Want an example? The main theme of the film is that words are weapons; the unforgettable opening sequence, in which the typewriter keys strike the paper with seemingly epic force, is the result of mixing whip and shotgun sounds with the actual sounds of typewriter keys. Now that's attention to detail, folks. As well, Pakula never allows the story to stray from the straight and narrow. Woodward and Bernstein remain the focus throughout, and while some minor characters get enough screen time to be memorable (Jason Robards' performance as Ben Bradlee garnered him a very well-deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar), we don't need to know who they all are; their function in the film is solely to either funnel information to, or keep information from getting to, Woodward and Bernstein. We don't need to know anything else about them. It adds a little kick to know trivial details, such as the guy playing Frank Wills (the security guard who discovers the break-in initially) actually was the late Frank Wills, but it's not necessary to comprehend the story of what started as a routine newspaper article about a hotel burglary and ended up being a series of articles that won the Pulitzer Prize, changed the face of political reporting in America, and incidentally saved Bob Woodward's job at the Washington Post. *** 1/2",All the President's Men
169,RueMorgue,Political corruption doesn't get any better than this...,10,29 May 2000,"When it comes to Watergate, this film is a must-see.  From break-in to resignation, this movie tells the story of the investigation by Woodward and Bernstein into the events at the Watergate Hotel, and the actions of those involved both before and after.  The two lead actors, Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, simply shine as the two reporters.  As well, Jason Robards (Ben Bradlee), Hal Holbrook (Deep Throat), and Jane Alexander (The Bookkeeper) are well suited for their roles.  (Watch for Bradlee's late night conversation with Woodward and Bernstein about J. Edgar Hoover... it had me in stitches.)The events behind the basic premise of the film are well known, and well documented by history.  This film takes those events even further, by giving the viewer an inside view into the workings of the Washington Post during the scandal.  A seemingly ordinary break-in at the Watergate turns into news when Woodward (Redford) attends the arraignment of the burglars, and finds the whole situation to be very suspicious.  After teaming up with Bernstein (Hoffman), the two embark on a journey into the inner-workings of the United States Government, finding information in such places as the CIA, the Committee to Re-Elect the President, and the Justice Department.On first viewing this film, I was intrigued enough to do a bit of research on my own about Watergate, since at the time, it was something I didn't know very much about.  I read the book this movie was based on, along with the follow-up, as well as ""Watergate: The Corruption of American Politics and the Fall of Richard Nixon"" by Fred Emery, an excellent read.  After reading those books, as well as some research, I viewed the film again.  It was amazing how much I saw the second time around, after doing some of my own research.  Names, dates, and activities which were all a blur after I first watched the film, started to make sense when I could put them in context. Therefore, I would suggest that you watch this film more than once, to get the whole picture.Put simply, the acting and directing in this film is excellent.  The story, while being well documented in various other media, gives a fresh insight into what made this break-in front-page news.  Anybody interested in the inner-workings of the American Government will want to see this film, as well as anybody with an interest in journalism.  Simply put, this film is excellent.My Rating:  10/10",All the President's Men
170,stephen_thanabalan_fans,"We're Susceptible to being ""All The President's Men"" too",8,29 June 2006,"By Stephen ThanabalanAdapted from the book by journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein by legendary screenwriter Bill Goldman and director Alan Pakula into a film with intelligible continuity in describing one of the most engrossing events in US history, this film must also be remembered as a representation of truth, and not taken as tacit fact with Wood-Stein celebrated as American heroes of the highest order even if it is tempting to be absorbed into this ostensible triumph with the film, otherwise we might be susceptible to being overreliant on the film's portrayal. And we'd become, ""All The President's Men""'s men. Let's not take anything away from the film as an entity though. This film is one of only a handful to show respect to the craft of journalism at the time and even till now, especially since the only others to do so before it went back possibly to 'Deadline USA' or even 'Citizen Kane'. How does it show this respect? It does right from the opening scene of the teletype firing typo bangs till that very epilogue where it closes with the same impact three years in progress. It shows this respect by tediously charting the very same tedious unglamorous legwork that went in behind the scenes of investigation. Some may feel that this 'meticulous to a fault' element lagged the film but I reckon showing the reporters deal with bureaucratic tape, recalcitrant obstacles (including their editors concerned with national stability) or intrepid calls and conversations with jittery sources highlighted the tenacity that lies in the heart of this true story. In doing so, the makers showcase the emotional rollercoasters and painstaking work required for journalism and tell the story about how Watergate's very story was pieced from puzzle.As Woodward and Bernstein, Redford and Hoffman are convincing from the start- bantering in industry jargon with striking clarity and gripping Colleague-ethical-friendship dramatics. They carry this well with characters rehearsed down to a pat from image (the smoking, hanging ties, corduroys, sideburns, apartments) all the way to reportage, epitomising their real life counterparts whom they understudied at the Post itself and probably gleaned off their willingness to do anything to get to the truth. They had an air of greenhorn/underdog about them and it probably made the audience love them as much as their sub who cried, ""They're hungry...don't you remember what it's like to be hungry"".The film also respects the historical context through usage of archive footage (albeit talking heads) of aides in interviews; President Nixon in congress and so on, aiding us in remembering the significance, magnitude and context of the time. Done this way, even a viewer without political interest is hooked (regardless of Redford's charm or Hoffman's charisma), and considering its a film about an event analysed in retrospect, the manner of how it reveals dynamic information excites, thrills, and surprises even if we know how it ends. Yet, the film is always struggling between dramatisation and authenticity. The scenes with Holbrook as Deep Throat (Felt the most confidential source in history revealed only in 2005) in the parking garage with Woodward are compelling, yet is evident that drama and reality are in tension. Robarbs as editor Bradlee, plays conflicted tensions with cynical maturity that feels authentic, constantly reminding Wood-Stein to uncover solid evidence, but poignantly keeping faith with the two and sharing their frustrations, yelling, ""why won't anyone go on the damn record in this country!"" with his new respect for them at the end of the film as uplifting as his move to take a calculated risk with running the story. It is in these moments, the film celebrates this raw triumph of humanity through success against the odds. Pakula does the job of keeping the movie suspenseful and intriguing. You flow with the characters and care about how they unravel the mystery, feel disappointments and rejection, stare road blocks cold and ultimately, end up celebrating their every accomplishment. Which brings me to this very question- Is it flat out accurate for people to leave this film thinking Woodward and Bernstein, inasmuch as the hyperbole and iconic praise bestowed (including the Pulitzer) they've received in the years since, at the time, really were responsible for bringing down the 37th US President per se? Sure, they pried open a scandal and showed A-G Mitchell was crooked, but film-wise, it cuts them at page 200 of a 336 page book. Furthermore, it does not cover the complex aftermath including the crucial Nixon Tapes imbroglio, possibly the most crucial piece of evidence. This is a reminder to us the audience, to question the numbers of facts vs. fiction in the film, the bias, as well as to remember that cinema is not a substitute for thorough research as it's storytelling's nature to wind up with good guys vs bad guys, that old binary, while the actualities vis a vis Watergate are far more complex than could ever be portrayed on a 135 minute feature. However, in saying that, it certainly is no fault of the film to do so, it is us, that need to remember that we like Wood-Stein need to bear this big picture in mind. In fact it says a lot about the power of perceptible effects that this very film wielded because, as a result of this very film's (in combination with the book's) influence, Wood-Stein changed the nature of public perception in journalism and politics, forging heroes of journalists - and liars of most public figures depicted (derogatorily or not, and more importantly, innocently or not). It is simply not the scope of this review to discuss the wider implications in the fields of journalism and political relationships, public relations, trust issues or agenda setting, but just like the film, let's realise and acknowledge these issues of a bigger picture and depth to actuality really exists and not bury them like, or rather, alongside, all the President's men.",All the President's Men

The battles in this movie are fought with minds and words. A chess game in which two pawns begin their steady march towards the other side of the board, passing layer after layer of conspiracy.This movie, most importantly, shows us that its not the end result, but how you get there that is important. I could not help, like other people, compare this movie to JFK as I watched it. Its clear that Stone wanted to make a movie like this one, but he missed the main point (as did Garrison). Even if you ""know"" what happened, you have to take the proper steps to prove it.As Deep Throat said, you start at the edges and work your way in. The two journalists had a good idea from the start of what happened, it was how to prove in a honest and legal way that was the problem. And that was the journey they took us on.This movie could be perceived as being boring by some, but the cause of that is not the movie, but ourselves. The villain is not confronted at the rooftop after a long chase, to have him deliver the grand explanation with a dramatic speech, only to have him jump off the rooftop as a final gesture.It shows us how two men, with little power and no authority, helped topple a President. Its very appropriate that this movie came out in 1976, as it showed that the Constitution is a document that still provides for checks and balances in our government. This movie shows us the strength of our 1st Amendment. The government did not like what was happening, and put pressure to stop it, but at no point did you see police or army march into the Post to shut it down, something that would still happen this day in many countries around the world.This movie reminds us that our right to pursue stories such as this one, the right to argue endlessly about politics on message boards, or even to post blogs about what you had for lunch, is one of the greatest strengths of this country. The media is not what it used to be 30 years ago, but it still has that potential.Wonderful film to watch, think and discuss.",All the President's Men
174,wavebounce,Really Enjoyable Movie,8,20 February 2021,Love the interviews aspect and the searching for exact and undeniable evidence to release the news.

175,jsataluri,A movie that made me realize what stupid mistakes a President can make.,10,21 February 2006,"Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford team up as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two reporters who covered and leaked the White House's involvement in the Watergate scandal, which led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. With support by Oscar Winner Jason Robards and a great cast led by Jack Warden, Martin Balsam and Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat, this movie convinced me that many presidents can be big liars as well. They commit mistakes that could ruin the country not only economically, but politically and socially and that is not what we expect of any president. Even if any important person is ordered by the government or any group not to speak about any scandals involving any government official or the President himself, the truth will eventually be leaked out. Lying and hiding anything scandalous are very atrocious to our country and to ourselves. Eventually the people will know what is going on. As citizens of the United States, we should keep an eye on our Presidents more to make sure they're not doing anything scandalous that could cause this country to fall into chaos.As for this film, it does a splendid job of showing Woodstein's (Woodward and Bernstein) hard work, determination and commitment in getting the facts and exposing us to a certain imminent danger. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is grasping the viewer deep inside the facts and not letting go till the end. I rank this a 10/10 for the drama and intense thrilling moments shown.",All the President's Men
176,Bandit1974,A History Lesson,10,6 August 2006,"I was born in 1974, so the events depicted in All The President's Men had just concluded. By the time I was old enough and interested enough to start asking, ""What's Watergate,"" more than a decade had passed.I can distinctly remember two events that throughout my schooling my fellow classmates and I were dying to learn more about, yet teachers were far too reluctant, to say the least, to consider discussing. The Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.When asked teachers would often cite a lack of time as the reason why we couldn't discuss these topics. In retrospect my guess is that even 10-15 years after these events had concluded teachers, at least those teaching junior high and high school, were still uncertain as to how to approach these two subjects. They undoubtedly had an opinion and perhaps opinions were still so strong on both issues that administrators and those in charge of curriculum decided a hands off approach was best. For that my fellow students and I made it through high school graduation learning very little about a fascinating very recent slice of American history.It wasn't until 1998 that I learned about a movie about the Watergate scandal called All The President's Men. Surprising to say the least since I am such a huge fan of film. It was the summer of 1998 and my then girlfriend and I were in Washington D.C. visiting some of my relatives. As always, my uncle was the ultimate tour guide. While touring the Library Of Congress he showed us the location of the famous over head shot that is seen in the movie. Once home from vacation I immediately went to the video store and rented All The President's Men. So good it was I actually watched it twice in one sitting.I truly believe that the 1970's is perhaps one of the most interesting decades in our country's history. I can't even really explain why, but I am quite certain that the overall darkness and disappointment that surrounds most of the decade has something to do with my interest in those years. Those ten years were sandwich'd between the artificial self important idealism of the 1960's and the bloated larger than life fat cat life style of the 1980's. For many growing up in the 1970's Watergate was just one example of why they were on a daily basis losing faith in our country.All The President's Men, I believe, captures this event perfectly. The story is told almost totally without any judgment whatsoever. You watch the movie from the reporter's point of view. Their job is to simply gather facts and report them to the public. It's not their job to make judgments. It's their job to present information so that we can make judgments. Of course that is a very idealistic view of the media, but I do believe that is what makes All The Predient's Men so special. We all know how the story ends. The movie is simply a presentation of the events surrounding Watergate and those involved with the scandal.Even today the story holds up and is suspenseful to watch. It's also a sincere glimpse into the day to day workings of a newspaper (at least at that time). There is no effort to glamorize the lives or jobs of Woodward and Bernstein, two working class investigative reporters.What makes All The President's Men so affective to me is the incredibly slow pace at which the tension builds. Especially by today's standards it's a very slow moving movie, but by the end of the movie the tension is nearly unbearable. For over two hours the tension builds and not once does it let up. Again, keeping in mind that we all know how the story ends. That being said, you can genuinely feel the fear that Woodward and Bernstein are experiencing as they unfold one of this country's most devastating political scandals.It's clear that everyone involved in the filming of All The President's Men (Redford, Hoffman, Pakula etc) were committed to giving it their all. It's a joy to watch a political thriller that doesn't seem hellbent on force feeding a point of view down the viewers (deep) throats. Knowing the outcome it's impossible to sympathize with Nixon and presenting the movie that way would have been an injustice, regardless of your political stance.I highly recommend All The President's Men to anyone who is a fan of political thrillers or anyone who is interested in this period of American history. Actually, I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of film because it is one of the best.",All the President's Men
177,pushnlacs,Interesting,7,17 September 2007,"Today I just read Ebert's review of Zodiac in which he calls it the All The Presidents Men of serial killer investigations. well thats pretty fitting. Just as Zodiac is today, ATPM was a film of details then.It starts With The Water Gate Break in and end with Nixons resignation. It follows the two reports that broke most of the news and who were seemingly two of the few people who cared to find out what was going on.I honestly never knew exactly how it all went down regarding Water Gate and this film is very informative. Though it's never boring. IT keeps you interested as the reporters follow leads, mostly dead ends, and you feel involved as they put clues together and build their story.(with the help of Deep Throat of course).I enjoyed it. 7.5/10",All the President's Men
178,imichelet,Good historical chronicles,6,14 January 2006,"Washington DC 1972. Strange burglars are arrested in the Watergate building. With an apparently insignificant story begins the biggest scandal ever in the American politics, which led to President Nixon's resignation. Two men are at the heart of the scandal, two hungry reporters without whom not much would have happened Woodword and Bernstein. As Chief Editor Ben Bradley summarizes, ""Now hold it, hold it. We're about to accuse Haldeman, who only happens to be the second most important man in this country, of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House. It would be nice if we were right."" The story of their investigation is here told soberly, step by step. It is not that easy to follow, and like in 'J.F.K', you'd better have a quick and good memory of names. But it shows quite well why the press is called 'the fourth power' Says Ben Bradlee again: ""Nothing's riding on this except the, uh, first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters, but if you guys f... up again, I'm going to get mad. Goodnight"" Of course, while watching this movie, one should be careful to dissociate it from more recent events. Woodword and Bernstein would be much less credible if we were to remember that they have been conspicuously absent from the scene these last few years, even though the Watergate looks like a kiddie joke compared with what has been going on lately at the White House",All the President's Men
179,shadock-2,"Good film, with weaknesses",7,8 February 2001,"Unlike many films ""based on a true story"", this one manages to find a lot better balance between fact and fiction, compared to say, ""The Perfect Storm"" which sacrifices accuracy to get the story across.  It's always a tough balancing act, but this film pulls it off brilliantly, driving the narrative forward with naturalistic acting, dialogue and situations. There's no overacting in this movie.That being said, and the film definitely being worth a look, it does suffer from a couple of major weaknesses.  First is the audio track.  Throughout the film, it is barely audible, and straining to listen often detracts from trying to follow the plot.  Since the plot is by no means easy to follow, this is a major failing.  The second is the ""sudden denouement"" syndrome that seems to infect Hollywood every once in a while.  These guys brought down the president, but the story stops well short of that point.  Instead of following the story to its natural conclusion, it sums it all up.  Its like ending Henry V after the Battle of Agincourt.   I think this was done to keep the movie short (it runs about 2 1/2 hours as it is), but studio types have to learn that if a movie is good (think Shoah, Greed or the ""Star Wars"" Nonology once it is finished), people will sit enthralled for hours rather than walk away.",All the President's Men
180,kaspen12,"An important movie, and a good one too!",9,19 March 2006,"Starring: Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Robards, Hal HolbrookAwards: 4 Oscars for Best Supporting Actor (Jason Robards); Best Adapted Screenplay (William Goldman); Best Art Direction; Best Sound (1977) (Nominated for Best Picture)Opening with a botched break-in attempt at Democratic HQ, this docu-drama tells the story of Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Redford)'s attempt to unravel the Watergate mystery. Up against the most powerful (and paranoid) man in the world, it's understandably difficult.The story is that of history -- everyone knows the basics, and the film does a pretty good job covering the details. It's fairly informative, but there are a few problems. There are times in the film where it becomes difficult to keep track of who's who. There are a lot of names being thrown around; it is a massive conspiracy. But sometimes, it's too much. I spent so long trying to place which name went with which person that I was pulled out of the reality of the film and realized I was watching a movie.Other than that, there's a lot to like. The expansive cinematography gives us a good concept the scope of what Woodward and Bernstein are undertaking, and the performances give us a good idea of how frustrating and frightful the entire ordeal must have been.FINAL SCORE: 8.6/10 = A-The acting here is all excellent, except for maybe Hoffman who seems to be doing his same old thing. Jason Robards is fantastic as Post editor Bill Bradlee -- his ass rides on the story's truth, and his dead-pan intimidation seems both effortlessly forceful and funny. The ending is a bit quick, but the story is a good one. This is a quality film.",All the President's Men
181,phoeniks-1,Breathlessly entertaining movie!,10,12 December 2005,"This could very well be the best political thriller ever made - in any event it is certainly the best of 1976! The account follows the painstakingly search for the truth behind the Watergate-scandal and the two relentless journalists Bernstein and Woodwards efforts to uncover the mystery. It is top-excitement from the first to the last frame, and it is my opinion that both Hoffmann and Redford do their very best work in this movie! The supporting cast is exceptionally good, including such solid actors as Martin Balsam, Jason Robards (he is fantastic!) and Jack Warden. The film is without any doubt the best work ever from acclaimed director Alan J. Pakula! You can watch this fabulous film again and again. It does not seem to date a bit!",All the President's Men
182,David N.,Second time's a charm,9,30 July 1999,"The first time I saw this film, I was suitably impressed but found I couldn't enjoy it completely.  In order to keep up with the relentless pace of the plot, I didn't pay as much attention to the writing and the performances as I should have.  When it was over, I felt the breakneck pace of the story overshadowed the screenplay and acting, rendering the film an accomplished reprisal of fact but not much else.What a difference a second viewing made.  My familiarity with the plot allowed me to appreciate all the finer details of the film.   Watching Redford and Hoffman's disciplined performances as Woodward and Bernstein, for instance, is like watching two expert tennis players work in tandem with one another.  When they act together, there is a delightful give-and-take, two masters working their way into a wonderful groove.  While they appear steady and reserved on the surface, the two actors radiate a noticeable undercurrent of excitement and dread, as if underneath their stern countenances they're screaming, ""Holy sh*t!  I can't believe we're doing this!!""  Redford, not the strongest dramatic actor, finds his normal-guy niche here and gives one of his best performances.  Hoffman is equally strong, making even the simplest scene seem like a masterpiece (the ""count to 10"" phone scene comes to mind).Throughout the film, Pakula communicates the idea of these two reporters being completely outnumbered by the people responsible for the Watergate break-in.  I loved the numerous overhead shots of Woodward and Bernstein that pull up, up, up, until they're nothing more than specks in the dirty streets of DC.  (This technique is also used in the classic scene where the two guys are searching through old records and the camera pulls up to the ceiling and shows them seated along the edge of a circular series of desks.)The film rockets right along, leaving the viewers as excited over the reporters' discoveries as they are.  William Goldman's script helps in this regard, I think, sticking straight to the meat and cutting out any unnecessary roughage.  The dialogue gets right down to business while working in realistic vocal habits and the like.  Redford really captures this well (listen to his stammering and self-corrections when he talks on the phone to sources - great stuff!).I can't recommend ""All the President's Men"" enough.  It's tightly-structured, fiercely-paced, and captivating as all get-out.  If necessary, watch it twice: once to find out who's who, the second time to savour the handiwork.  If you want to talk more about it, leave a red flag on the potted plant on your balcony.",All the President's Men
183,EddieK,Required viewing for anyone interested in Watergate,10,7 November 2005,"Over the years, I've watched ""All the President's Men"" several times - most recently, after the revelation of ""Deep Throat"" as the FBI's W. Mark Felt. The movie never loses its excitement for me, and remains one of my favorite films from the 1970s.The tale of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they discover the true story behind Watergate could have been dry; indeed, director Alan Pakula, perhaps not entirely trusting the material, jazzes up the action by inserting ersatz ""chase scenes"" and other elements from standard thrillers. But ""All the President's Men"" excites the most when Robert Redford's Woodward juggles phone calls to glean new bits of information, or when Dustin Hoffman's Bernstein extracts names from reluctant witnesses. It calls to mind the heady days of investigative journalism, a time when brave men like Ben Bradlee ran newspapers, rather than today's corporate conglomerates.Pakula effectively conveys the reporters' struggle through a variety of techniques. A mournful Vivaldi trumpet duo highlights Woodward and Bernstein's loneliness as they fight uphill to break their story. Shots of the two reporters against Washington's monuments - or most memorably, from the ceiling of the Library of Congress - eloquently portray the reporters' struggle against Washington's power structure.Both Redford and Hoffman deliver subtle yet inspired performances, aided by a stellar supporting cast, which includes Oscar winner Jason Robards as Bradlee, Oscar nominee Jane Alexander as a key witness, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Stephen Collins, Ned Beatty, Robert Walden, and others. Hal Holbrook portrays ""Deep Throat,"" delivering perhaps my favorite line from the movie: ""Forget the myths the media's created about the White House. The truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand."" ""All the President's Men"" should be required viewing for anyone interested in Watergate, investigative journalism, or politics in general. In today's troubled times, with reporters going to jail to protect confidential sources and White House officials desperately trying to cover up the sources of leaks, we could use men like Deep Throat, Woodward and Bernstein, and Ben Bradlee again.",All the President's Men
184,jfmvp,"A True, Breathtaking Political Thriller",10,19 July 2009,"Alan J. Pakula's ""All the President's Men"" (1976) is the greatest journalism film in cinematic history. It's up there with the classics of the political realm, as well. ""All the President's Men"" is both chilling and exhilarating because of its performances, setting, pacing, and of course the fact that it's all true.Isn't it mind-boggling that something like this really occurred? I think we're all a bit skeptical of the American government and what it hides at times, but a scandal involving politicians and officials at all levels, one leading all the way up to the President of the United States? ""Jesus"" -- as John Mitchell says to Carl Bernstein (played wonderfully by Dustin Hoffman) when Carl tells him about the groundbreaking story he plans to run the following day. That's all I can say.I've seen ""All the President's Men"" six or seven times, and I've been mesmerized each and every time. The performances are perfect, the truths are shocking, and the reality is one of the most incredible stories in American history.Look closely at the cast. As I've already said, Hoffman is excellent as Bernstein. Robert Redford, in one of the most balanced and seamless performances of his illustrious career, is equally as good as the now-famous Bob Woodward. Jason Robards is a scene stealer as editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee, in a performance that I'm told IS Bradlee...to a tee. Robards' fantastic work earned him the Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category.Every other supporting role is precisely executed. Jane Alexander deserves special consideration as ""The Bookkeeper"" with all the dirty little secrets, and Alexander in fact received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. The funny thing is, she's on screen for two scenes. That's it. And one of them is very short. That's how subtle her performance is, and how effective.Hal Holbrook is particularly memorable as ""Deep Throat,"" Woodward's oft-talked about background source for the series of Watergate stories. Within the past five years we've learned that Deep Throat was actually William Mark Felt Sr., a formerly prominent FBI agent. Holbrook's portrayal leaves a lasting impression, and director Pakula shoots his scenes with atmosphere and tension.Stephen Collins (as Hugh Sloan) and Robert Walden (as Donald Segretti) are also deserving of mention.When it comes down to it, what's memorable about this film is the way it unfolds. The trials and tribulations of ""Woodstein's"" reporting process. The real-feeling board meetings at the Washington Post. The eerie sense that Woodward is going to get whacked. The way Woodward and Bernstein work off one another, and the chemistry that Redford and Hoffman reflect on screen.All things considered, this is a masterpiece. Now let's not give Pakula and the cast all of the credit for that...Hell, we should thank President Nixon for the storyline.",All the President's Men
185,teacherlogan,History and Journalism on Film. Brilliantly done.,10,16 February 2007,"As a lover of historical drama and journalism, I find that All The President's Men strikes a cord on several levels. It shows the inner workings of a newsroom. It shows the process of putting together a news story. It shows the desire to be right; not just first. In today's media, it seems that the goal is to throw out a story and see if it withstands scrutiny. Throw it up on the wall, see if it sticks. All the President's Men shows the importance of checking facts, confirming sources and standing by your story if you think it's accurate, whatever the consequences.Simply put, this film is about the Watergate investigation by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post. Woodward and Bernstein were two unknown reporters at the time of a break in at the Watergate hotel, the Democratic Committee's headquarters. But through following every lead and source, they brought to light a conspiracy within the Nixon administration that would ultimately lead to its downfall.But while such a subject might make an interesting episode of Dateline, this film takes the investigation one step further. The investigation is a 'who dunnit' involving some of the most powerful men in the country. While burglary and wire tapping might not grab headlines, this movie represents a different time. Government was trusted. 24 hour news did not exist. Print journalism still held tremendous weight. It was a big deal to accuse the President's staff, and eventually the President himself, of participation in federal crimes. Oh how far we've come. Such accusations are now a commonplace on the nightly news.The fact that this movie came out so soon after the Watergate scandal speaks to how much this controversy had gripped the Nation. The investigation culminated in the only resignation of a sitting President, one of the most compelling moments in our country's history. I have read the book by Woodward and Bernstein of the same name. The film is faithful to their account. The film is a testament to what good journalism should be. For every door that closes, and there are MANY doors that close, there is an open window. The Truth is out there. Perseverance is ultimately rewarded.We follow Woodward and Bernstein as they piece the story together. We watch as they follow leads, call sources and write down bits of information as haphazardly as we might doodle in a college lecture. It's hard to make drama out of such a mundane process, but All The President's Men pulls it off. The movie does not insult our intelligence. It shows how hard the process is, which makes us appreciate the final product.There are many historical characters at the center of All the President's Men. However Deep Throat, Woodward's anonymous source, is perhaps the most compelling one because he represents the struggle between bringing the truth to light and the firestorm that will result. He wants to see justice, but doesn't want to be the reason for HIS administration's downfall. As a result, he could tell more, but doesn't. He could draw them a map, but instead gives landmarks. He gives cryptic advice that seems to mean nothing, but gets the ball rolling. He is the wise old sage. The oracle, if you will. Every mystical journey has a beacon to guide its travelers. For Woodward and Bernstein, Deep Throat is theirs.Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman and Jason Robards head an outstanding cast. However, the central figure in this film is not the reporters, their co-workers or their sources. It's the Truth. We applaud the efforts of Woodward and Bernstein, because as a society we want to know the truth and it is the media's job to deliver. We rejoice when the breaking story runs. It is like a child being born. Upon being met with criticism, we stand with Post editor Ben Bradlee as he proclaims ""We stand by our boys"". Where today a representative from his legal department would tell Bradlee to stuff the story in a drawer, Bradlee stands behind his reporters because their ultimate objective was his since he got into the business. Not just to break the story, but to break the Right Story. All The President's Men is a portrayal of the power of the Truth and the desire to find it.",All the President's Men

187,bahrom1,one of the best true story based films ever,9,27 December 2002,"I don't like movies based on true stories. Fiction is a lot more cinematically compelling: the script can be changed at will - new characters or plot twists can be introduced, a couple of explosions can be added, endings can be changed to better please the audience and so on. With real story based films there is none of that and therefore it's almost impossible to maintain suspense or create the sense of purpose.""All the President's men"" is one stark exception. Despite being based on a true story book ( and a non fiction one at that!) it will keep you on the edge of your seat better than any thriller. This is mostly due to a good script and  excellent acting performances by Redford, Hoffman and Robards. For those from another planet, the story is about two Washigton Post reporters Bob Woodward (Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) and their investigation of the Watergate scandal. Robards is also great as a tough Post editor Ben Bradlee. The story is told through the eyes of Woodward and Bernstein. The president and his men are never seen on the screen which makes their presence all the more sinister.Movie's portrayal of the day-to-day journalist routine is very believable. Unfortunately, some of the shadier methods employed by the two reporters in their quest for the story (which WERE described in the book) are left out. This makes their characters somewhat one-dimensional. However, this is a relatively small gripe. My only other regret is that the book and hence the movie end too abruptly before the story resolves itself. This is, of course, inevitable because the latter part of  Watergate  was dominated by different players than two Washington Post reporters. Not surprisingly, the book ""The Final days"" (also by Woodward and Bernstein) which deals with that period is not told from the reporters' perspective. Incidentally, ""The Final days""  is every bit as good as ""All the president's men"" and I wish someone made a movie based on that.All in all ""All the president's men"" is a must see classic that stood well against the test of time.",All the President's Men

193,ttornak,Pen is mightier than the sword,9,20 August 2005,"You don't need car chases, blood, extra-terrestrial monsters or 50 twists in the story-line to make a compelling thriller. What you do need is a story, a couple of underdogs with brains and a powerful enemy.As a non-American things in this political thriller may sometimes be a little hard to follow. The special counselor to the president ? What kind of job is that supposed to be ? Campaign to re-elect the president, what kind of organization is that ? In the hands of a lesser director, this might have easily resulted in a movie that gives the viewer the impression he's lost in a jungle of legal mumbo-jumbo that tries to disguise a paper-thin story. This is not the case here. The script never let these terms get in the way of the story and the pacing is perfect. We're thrown from one step into another without ever feeling lost. The end-result is that you don't get an in-dept review of everything that has happened but you definitely get the story.The underdogs in this story are the two reporters as well as various people they need whom they need to get their story from. Everyone is scared to go too far. Pure luck, carelessness, tricks of the trade, secrecy, arrogance and regret all play their part in what is essentially a human drama and add to the credibility of the story.The suspense doesn't come as much from life-threatening situations but follows from a more everyday threat : to loose your job and forget about your career. The pressure is never defined but it is there and affects everybody. The reporters fight time, lies, secrets and the fear of the people they interview. The people involved have to choose between their career, the people they care for and their ideals.The dialogs are excellent. Every line counts and although this makes for an intensive experience, the quality of the script makes it worthwhile. Hoffman is terrific and Redford plays well, but the supporting cast is equally impressive, from Albert Brooks to Baxter & Collins (Mr. & Ms Sloan), Walden (Segretti) and the bookkeeper. Special mention to Jason Robards who is unforgettable as Ben Bradlee who rightfully got the Oscar for best supporting actor. ""All the President's Men"" applauds the people that value the truth and gives the viewer an idea of what investigative journalism should be. But more importantly, it shows the power of words and knowledge and gives you a hint about the relationship between the press and the government.Based on historical facts, some aspects of the movie may seem dated, but the execution is perfect and the message still stands. An important classic : I gave it 9",All the President's Men

Now I wish I hadn't.The only people who should watch this are those who are extremely interested in this version of the details behind the Watergate scandal, the conspiracy theorists, or those who are fascinated by investigative reporting.The film shows Woodward and Burnstein digging up the real story behind the famous break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters right around when President Nixon was to be re-elected.  They uncover illegal covert operations being carried out by all levels of government.  They spend the whole movie interviewing people and trying to get them to go ""on the record"" so they can print their story.That's really all there is to it.  The viewer doesn't find out anything about the protagonists' backgrounds or beliefs or goals or anything. There's no character development, and there's no reason for us to care whether they succeed or not.  The movie begins with the break-in and ends when they publish (and have to defend) their story.  Everything in between is just them taking notes while pursuing leads on the phone, or arguing with the editors.  Slow. and boring.",All the President's Men

Stylishly shot by Alan J Pakula it has a documentarist vibe and feel (probably the filmstock) and the actors are all excellent- as they were back in the day.

I'm sorry I did. Ultra-tight political filmmaking, to be sure, and an excellent view into the workings of the press vs. power game, but it is without any REAL, tangible firepower. It's hard not to feel left-leaning vibes in this, which turns half (or more) of the population off, but more importantly, it lacks a patient director's eye.

198,Bill Slocum,Somehow it seems thin...,8,28 July 2002,"What happened to the rest of the story? The film ends with vigorous denials from the White House that chief of staff Haldeman controlled a secret slush fund, Post editor Ben Bradlee saying he stands by the story, Woodstein learning they went adrift when they assumed CREEP Finance director testified to the Grand Jury about Haldeman's involvement (he had only told the pair he'd have no problem with them writing such a thing, cue Felix Unger here), Woodward telling Deep Throat they will resign if they got it wrong, Deep Throat telling him to get out his pad, the reporters typing away in the background while Nixon is sworn in on TV in the foreground, then a series of chattering newswires (dated before and after August 9, 1974, so pay attention) building to the climax of Nixon's forced resignation. All in about five minutes. The end.So when did Woodward and Bernstein get back on track and nail the story for good? How did they salvage those Pulitzers from the mess they made? You can read the book if you must know, but don't look for answers in the movie. The producers were running out of time. The movie had already run 150 minutes and the story was barely out of 1972. Much more ground needed to be covered, so they threw together one of the most frustrating ""let's-end-this-sucker-now"" climaxes ever shot for such a critically-regarded film. It's frustrating, because there seems so much more story left wanting here.What we do see is good, good enough to whet our appetite for more. The arc of the story is vigorously paced and well-detailed (much of the problem is they ran out of time filming lesser things like Bernstein's visit to the Florida DA's office) and overall offers one of the best depictions of the idealized journalistic lifestyle you'll ever see. Yes, there's too many talking heads, and phone calls, and fluorescent lighting, but that's what it was and it was a hell of a story. Its strong dramatic punch never feels forced or anything other than natural. Every performance seems special in some way, but there's no attention being called to the acting at all, or the sets, or the costumes or music. The quotes are the only thing that really stick with you, which tells you screenwriter William Goldman's approach was properly journalistic in approach as well as content. It's a terrific approach, and it works. But the structure of the story needed more work.No question this was a tough film to make in 1975, with all the major Watergate figures still alive and hiring lawyers. But if I was Ben Bradlee, I'd send this one back for a rewrite. Not because it's not good, but because it could have been better.",All the President's Men

200,MrGeorgeKaplan,You cannot not deny that this isn't a great movie,9,21 November 2006,"As a piece of film-making, it is an absolute cracker. Both Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman were at the absolute peak of their powers, and their portrayal of the driven Washington Post investigative reporters  Woodward and Bernstein - all corduroy suits, dishevelled hair, cigarettes and half-mast ties is superb. The old stagers of the newsroom are also great, particularly Jason Robards as Ben Bradlee, the editor in chief. The cinematography is also superb, the aerial shot of the Library of Congress, and the shots of Woodward's battered Volvo cruising the night-time streets of Washington DC give some clue as to Michael Mann's formative influences. But there is art here too; the typewritten titles, and the Teletype machine accompanied by 21-gun salute narrating the denouement of the story are effective devices underscoring the words as weapons theme here.The newspaper industry has changed a lot in the last thirty years, to the detriment of proper investigative reporting as is depicted here. A court piece about a break in at an office building could not possibly command the attention of two staff writers  particularly if the editor had some nice pictures of Madonna to put on the front page. The methodology of the editors  fighting for the front page, and the journalists  reaching for the phone book rather than referring to Google, shows what serious business journalism used to be. And the outcome of the story shows what power the press has and how it should wield it.As a piece of historical drama it is incredibly informative. My knowledge of Watergate went something like: break in blah blah blah corruption blah blah blah Nixon resigns. Now I have well and truly filled in the blah blah blahs and the level of the corruption and double- dealing occurring in Washington and within the Republican Party is truly astonishing. It is a shame then that the film concludes with Nixon's re-election before his resignation because there were doubtless more rotten links in the chain flushed out by Woodward and Bernstein. It is also, in a way, a pity that this corruption was exposed at all  for we all now expect our politicians to be corrupt. If it is their job to protect the best interests of the electorate should they not use every method at their disposal? If one side fights dirty, the only choice is for the other to fight dirtier.",All the President's Men

The story, top notch casting, editing and directing give this an easy 10 out of 10.Why so many people still deny the facts brought out in this film is beyond me.

That being said, it does do an amazing job of keeping the viewer's attention, despite being about little more than the scramble to get sources to go on record.This is the third in Alan J. Pakula's ""political paranoia trilogy"", although it seems to have been shoehorned in, as it's much more a drama, and its vibe isn't paranoia so much as rigor. What it takes to get a good story, and what it means for the press to have a power that feels more like a privilege these days. The power to get respect even from hostile sources. It's a film about hard work and bravery, but without a shred of exploitation, hype, or unbelievability. And Robert Redford, especially, is as natural for the role as Jane Fonda was in Klute. If nothing else, Pakula knows how to get a good performance.Considering that the story arc for this film ends far too abruptly, and, again, most of the plot involves Woodstein getting doors slammed in their faces, it's almost a miracle that this works as well as it does. If the audience didn't know the story ahead of time, maybe it wouldn't have worked at all. Probably an over-hyped film, but still not one to miss.",All the President's Men

Even though the general conclusion is likely true the reporters were unable to actually get the information themselves.  I know this firsthand from testimony that what was written in the book and said in the movie was not said in real life.  It is also amazing how Woodward and Bernstein claim how people feel from their voice over a telephone then have the actors or actresses make that sound in the movie.  The rules of heresay certainly do not apply here.  While certainly someone or some people in the Nixon administration committed criminal acts it must be realized that this was and is not out of the ordinary.  Anyone who believes that political espionage has not existed since the Continental Congress is fooling themselves.  Of course this doesn't excuse Nixon's actions but he was not a particularly bad person.  I also think we can hardly call this movie suspenseful when the outcome is already decided before it starts.

The audience could not be expected to follow detail, so wrap up the story in action and atmosphere instead. Hill Street Blues was built on that notion. So the series of investigations could have seemed repetitive if there was no feel of an approaching goal. This led to a very unsatisfactory finale. All this could have been avoided by using a narrator, but I can see that could have spoiled the style and directed attention from our heroes.

218,calinchiriac,Ever Heard of Watergate?,8,25 June 2017,"""All the President's Men"" (1976) follows the investigation led by Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) on the Watergate scandal, running parallel with President Nixon's campaign for reelection. As the two lead characters see their investigation unfold, hardly, must I say, they get banged down by your usual, but not quite so, ""newspaper"" drama : missing sources, pettiness of the story, abstinence and denial by the witnesses, lack of hard evidence and, above all, threat to the survival of the Post itself.This is a gripping time piece. Almost half of the story is spent at the newspaper's offices, overshadowed by the permanent key-tapping of ardent typewriters and the constant chatter of young secretaries, which add a great sense of urgency and authenticity to a typical 1970s Washington workplace, where Woodward and Bernstein, sitting face-to-face in an odd, diagonal line that becomes a subtle symbol for a head-butting professional relationship, learn to first tolerate each other (and each other's egos) before uniting to unveil the truth. The interactions between Hoffman and Redford throughout the movie are as delightful to watch as they are crucial to making William Goldman's Academy Award-winning script reach its climax. We, as spectators, pay attention to these two very powerful actors' every word with such care and eagerness without even seeing through their banter and mistakes, breathing sighs of relief when catching a loose second and setting the alarm as the next one arrives. In the meantime, we get glimpses of written notes swinging in every direction from Woodward, mainly, creating a true journalistic feel, and enthralling conversations over the phone from both characters, desperately attempting to connect with not only the people behind the scandal, but also with the obscure situation on which they vainly light their lamps on, to a point where the phone becomes a mere extension of the hand and the absence of voice on the other end of the wire provokes an expression of total indifference. The story hides behind this progressive and discreet line of events without ever declaring ""right"" or ""wrong"", and plays with the writers' heads, leading them to frustration, unaided by the pressure of their superiors, the Metro News' supervisor Harry Rosenfeld (Jack Warden) and the Post's Ben Bradlee (Jason Robards, in a sublime performance).The remainder of the movie explores Woodward and Bernstein's (or ""Woodstein"", as Bradlee once cries out, interrupting the high-pitched noise of the office for more than two seconds) attempts to force the truth (or, at least, parcels of it) out of various mouths (White House bookkeepers, attorneys, lawmen, you name it) and shows with true excitement the abusive paraphrasing and deduction the two men make with a less-than-minimal amount of words or simple nods from the speakers (or non-speakers). In fact, the two are so convinced of the story's credibility that they unequivocally trade sentences for common sense, really. This is where the movie falters; its will and urgency to depict these moments rapidly makes them seem trivial and forgettable. For instance, an ""informant"" of Woodward's (""Deep Throat"", as they call him) only agrees to meet with him in a dark, underground parking, but the movie never truly gives his character the proper gravitas and importance that his name really bears, historically speaking.Nevertheless, ""All the President's Men"" is the prototype of a solid and honest depiction of a historical event or, in this case, a more or less extended period of time marked by historical events. Alan J. Pakula's camera is turning around America's capital with remarkable ease, giving us the feeling that we have already been there, with Woodward and Bernstein, and capturing the charm of residential homes, the cacophony of midnight streets and the peacefulness of everyday places, such as libraries and diners. As already mentioned, the dynamics of the characters and of their relationships elevate the movie way above average, but the thoroughness to get the story ""just the right way"" makes it even greater. At some points during the movie, we are projected with real-time speeches from Nixon and his entourage or with journalistic coverage from 1972 and 1973 on a small television set in the office, further down the road from Woodward's small cabinet. As we exchange glances from the coverage on TV to Woodward's continuous typing, we take a step back and contemplate the successful effort of converting the broadcasted story into a much more intimate one.",All the President's Men
219,dotdashdash,The film by itself is not as good as people say is simply because the events depicted are important,4,6 October 2012,"I found it surprising how many reviewers here have based their vote on considerations that go beyond the film itself. We have the Republicans around who think that Nixon was treated unfairly by being forced to resign for Watergate, and that the attention the scandal and this film received are part of a left-wing bias in the American media. So they give it poor ratings. On the other side, you have those who think Watergate was an important part of American history, and that Bernstein and Woodward deserve the fame they got for their work. So they give the film high ratings. In my view, however, the film should be judged by itself, not by non-cinematic considerations of that sort.Coming to that point, I believe that the film suffers from its pace, which is unbearably slow at some times and too fast at others. Much of the plot mostly depicts Redford and Hoffman interviewing people on the phone or in person, sometimes getting answers and sometimes not. While I, personally, do not expect a film to feature explosions and guns to be thrilling, I do believe that watching Robert Redford's telephone calls gets dull after the third or so time. Then, later on, when the investigations start to get traction, the pace becomes a bit too fast for the audience; names of people involved in various party or government institutions are flung around, making it hard to keep track of who is involved with whom in what manner. Towards the end, the film seems to surrender its difficult task of storytelling altogether, simply recounting the climax of the Watergate scandal by retelling it on a typewriter. That demonstrates, in my view, that the material makes for a good book, but is not really apt to be turned into a film.As for the acting, Redford is doing an excellent job - he remains in character throughout the film, making you believe that this is how the real Woodward must have felt during the investigations. However, I feel that Hoffman remains rather clumsy, wooden, and awkward most of the time; he does not manage to involve the audience in the scenes in which he is a central figure.In summary, while I acknowledge that this film has historical value for its close chronological link to Watergate itself (making, at the same time, the depiction of journalism and office work in the 1970s must be very realistic), I believe that much of the praise this film received is for the importance of the real-life events it depicts; its intrinsic cinematic quality is, in my view, rather mediocre.",All the President's Men

Once you take the time to read the history of what led up to Nixon's resignation, it adds all the more veracity to the efforts of Woodward and Bernstein. One of the more interesting details, is how the relationship between Woodward and Felt developed over the years. It supports the premise that one never knows how a chance meeting will result in the development of a friendship that will last for many years to come. In police work, it was referred to as ""inarticulable gut reaction"". That ""feeling"", the ""thin slicing"" that something is afoot. Like a pair of junk yard dogs, Woodward and Bernstein stick to the trail until their suspicions are confirmed and the results, as the saying goes, is history. Makes the movie all the more incredible, when you keep reminding yourself that it is based on facts.In summation, follow your beliefs and always ""to thine own self be true"" for the truth will set you free.",All the President's Men

224,fortyfiveseconds,A Film That Does a Book Justice,10,18 August 2006,"As well as showing that a newspaper cared about truth, the film should be an inspiration to anybody interested in journalism, as well as a positive one to those who believe that people can't make a difference. Dustin Hoffman (Bernstein) is brilliant, as is Redford as Woodward. But the best performances go to Jason Robards and Jack Warden, subtle as supporting roles, but beautiful. If your story is right you can defeat everything stacked against you, and that is what happened. A wonderfully directed film. If you liked the film, read the book. An absorbing, stunning read. As you get into the book you realise just what a job these two journalists did (picture the scene, going through the little bits of paper and multiply it by a lot). Oh for the likes of that type of journalism again (and newspaper owners).",All the President's Men

I especially like the scenes where Woodward is meeting with deep throat in the garage dimly lit, it is an exciting touch of conspiracy. I'm confused by deep throat's comments ""look at the overall"". What is he talking about? When does looking at the ""overall"" help woodward and bernstein figure it out? What ""overall""?I also don't understand why deep throat talks in code. Why doesn't he just plainly state what he knows? By talking in code, he only lengthens the conversation and increases the risk of getting caught. I am confused about this as well.",All the President's Men
226,private_jack_sparrow,What I thought about the movie,3,19 October 2006,"All the President's men The movie ""All the President's Men"" was an alright movie. The movie is about two men named Carl Bernstein, played by Dustin Hoffman, and Bob Woodward, played by Robert Redford; they work for the Washington Post. Bob has worked for the post nine months and Carl has work with the Washington Post since the age of 16. They get a story about the Watergate break in that leads to the Republican Party and the re-election of President Nixon.Carl and Bob wind up on a very strange story about the re-election and the Watergate break in. They spend most of their time talking to people who don't want their names in the paper about talking about the president to the post.When it comes time to talk to another person, Deep Throat played by Hal Holbrook, who doesn't want his name mentioned in the article at all but is willing to tell Bob Woodward if they are right or not but nothing else. It's really neat that Deep Throat took his own time to come out to the press and tell them that he was the one unknown source that was talking to Bob in the parking garage about the story until last year (2005) and his real name is W. Mark Felt.Aspects of the movie are okay, but they could of worked some parts to make the movie to have more involvement to the watchers.The acting was pretty poor at times and then mind blowing at others. Also times when the shots in the movie were really dark and you couldn't see anything in the background to notice anything else going on.The dialogue was great between Carl and Bob and great when talking to sources and not that great when they are talking to their boss, Harry Rosenfeld, played by Jack Warden. The dialogue is so good in the movie you can tell that Carl and Bob don't really like each other in the beginning then towards the middle they become friends. The pacing of the movie was really slow paced when Carl and Bob weren't doing anything and then extremely fast paced when the story is getting really involved so you can't really understand what is going on. They need to slow down the parts when everything is clicking and fitting together to make sense of the story and speed up the parts when they aren't doing anything that focus on the story of the President or the Watergate break in.To rate this movie from one to ten, it would be a three because it's not the greatest movie out there and not the worst but there a lot of things that they could of worked on to make it a mind blowing amazing movie for everyone.",All the President's Men
227,startlearningvolk,"The film ""All the President's Men""",5,20 December 2020,"The film ""All the President's Men"" was made in 1976. This is a thriller. The director of the film is Alan Pakula. The film is based on a documentary book by journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein who investigated the Watergate scandal in 1973. The main characters of this film are Bob Woodward acted by Robert Redford, Carl Bernstein acted by Dustin Hoffman and Harry Rosenfeld acted by Jason Robards. It will be difficult to understand the film for people who do not know the history of the United States, especially, the history of Watergate. There are many names, numbers and dates. I think a lot of people have to use Internet sources to understand the film.
This film is about journalism. It is very serious and professional. Two Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein begin their investigation. The film shows the complexity and dynamics of journalistic investigation. The characters have to know something from other people. At first, the plot seems interesting and exciting but only for a few minutes. Then the filmmakers try to plunge us into the routine of journalists whose days are very long. During the day journalists have a lot of phone calls and paperwork. There are a lot of such moments of work in the film.
In my opinion, the main drawback of the film is that it has too much dialogue and a lot of information about the routine of journalists. The main advantage of the film is surely the acting. It can be seen that the actors try to give their best. I recommend this film to those who like detective stories and facts from US history.",All the President's Men
228,fumnisa,"If you think newspaper jurnalist is boring job,one of the best proof of importance of jurnalistc integrity.",10,22 December 2020,"The film is dedicated to the Watergate case. This scandal consisted in the fact that during the 1972 election campaign, wiretapping equipment was discovered at the residence of the US Democratic Party - so then ruling President Nixon hoped to be aware of what plans were being made in the party that was competing with him in the elections. It was absolutely proven that the ""wiretapping"" was conducted with the knowledge of Nixon. The main characters of the film are two Washington Post journalists who have promoted this case, independently dug up all the evidence and published their research. Which led to a huge scandal and Nixon's resignation. Forgetting about personal competition and exposing their career and life to damage, the journalists brought the investigation to the end. The result was the early resignation of the 37th US President Richard Nixon, who had just been elected to a second term.The political drama later known as the Watergate affair began in June 1972, when police arrested a group of unidentified men who entered the Democratic Party headquarters on the sixth floor of the Watergate hotel complex in Washington. No one could even imagine that the vague story of the infiltration of five spies into the presidential candidate's headquarters would result in the loudest political scandal of the decade. The Washington Post employees Bob Woodward and Karl Bernstein got hold of materials showing that representatives of the Nixon administration organized a secret wiretapping at the headquarters of their political competitors. Journalists published a sensation: the threads to the events of that night are drawn to the White House. And from that moment on, the world froze in anticipation. The journalistic investigation proceeded step by step. Restless Woodward and Bernstein found witnesses, unearthed a check for a large sum, credited to one of the burglars . They unwound the case for almost two years. The most valuable testimony was given by a secret witness, whose real name was not disclosed, but it was his testimony that ultimately led to the publication of scandalous materials on the pages of the newspaper. Watergate toppled everyone - President Nixon, senators, diplomats. The final footage shows a television screen that broadcasts the resignation of President Nixon and the journalists Woodward and Bernstein, sitting next to them.",All the President's Men
229,careyditmars,I love this movie because of the terrific acting,9,16 November 2006,"I love this movie because of the terrific acting. Everyone is convincing. The down-to-earth style of the performances contrasts very well with the gravity and national import of the story. It sends a message that the average person of the United States is decent, law-abiding and loves their country.Hoffman especially presents his character with such genuine detail and humanity that you are taken right into the story. What must it have felt like to dig for facts with people that were afraid of powerful superiors? Hoffman and Redford show us. Their authenticity makes a political thriller into a moving account of decent people trying to correct aberrant powerholders.",All the President's Men

Accidentally, five unidentified strange men with large quantities of eavesdropping equipment were discovered by an ordinary hotel security guard near the offices of the Democratic Party of the United States. No one had a clue yet, they were just merely small pawns in a high stakes game of far more powerful men, including then-President Richard Nixon, and that in just one year all hell will break loose and will lead to a devastating effect on the Republican party of the US.""All the President's Men"" is a complete and detailed reproduction of the entire scandal that provides a deep insight into the causes and consequences of what happened. Very carefully, it tells the story of the meticulous investigation done by the then very young and unknown journalists of The Washington Post magazine, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, both are Pulitzer prize-winning and extremely famous journalists nowadays. In fact, it has become the final institution of justice which has brought to light and public attention a blatant attempt to circumvent the country's law and constitution at the highest political level.The unhurried action immerses the viewer in the scene of the main characters, and makes us empathise with them. The duet of main actors is great. The supporting characters are also perfectly cast. It's worth putting a stronger emphasis on the well adapted script and elaborate dialogues, for sure. And, of course, the amazing director's approach. Not surprisingly, the film won four Oscars in 1976 and made a lasting impact on its genre and zeitgeist.In my opinion, ""All the President's Men"" is a great political thriller that is, first, interesting and, second, I would say, quite creepy to watch. The director precisely did an amazing job in creating a feeling of something threatening and unpredictable on the screen, but at the same time very important because the real people on whose story the picture is based, regardless of the dangers of political games, decided to expose wrongdoing of the upper echelons and managed to change the course of American history.",All the President's Men
231,gorlankinaliza,Dynamic and thrilling Watergate scandnal,10,6 October 2021,"When we think about historical drama or biography, we imagine anything but an involving thriller. All the president's men sheds the light on the Watergate scandal. The script is based on the biography written by the main heroes of the story: Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstain who did an amazing job in revealing the truth in 1972.In the very beginning we are witnessing a break-in at the Democratic Party National headquarters. The police finds five men who subsequently were called plumbers as they were trying to install listening devices inside the office. The incident didn't go down well and already mentioned Washington post's reporter Bob Woodward started an investigation. He was amazed to see top lawyers defending criminals from nowhere, that is why he put a stronger emphasis on some names in their biographies. Accompanied by Carl Bernstain, Bob Woodward started a string of cover-ups, which had serious implications. In the very beginning and till the very end, journalists did not see the motivation of the unscrupulous manoeuvres done, but were aimed to expose wrongdoing. Trying to follow the digital trail (almost the paper one), they faced witnesses shying away and documents being destroyed. And when the stakes were high, Woodward and Bernstain finally trumped a witnesses' silence and the results they got had a devastating effect on the very top of the US's ruling elite.The film itself is full of dialogues and that are actors' play and the directors ideas which keep the whole movie dynamic and involving. Some elements from spy movies, such as secret meeting with whistleblower on the car-parking or red flag on the balcony instead of usual phone-call add some mystery into the film. The plot is easy to follow and when it's fifteen minutes left until the end and the happy-ending seemed to be far away, I was just wondering what the ending will be but then the all the hell broke loose...",All the President's Men

On the verge of becoming a young man i still watch movies all the time its my hobby and i have to say that this movie was one of the best yet it was quite lengthy but still was all worth it. I was sad to hear that the director of this film passed on but for a tribute i give this comment to him. I hope that the actors that have played in this movie like it and enjoyed it every step of the way i know that i would have been happy too be in this movie.

234,jhuebert-1,My most-watched film,10,19 February 2005,"Pacing of this movie is incredible. A lovable young Dustin Hoffman, and an adorable Redford (the ""original"" Brad Pitt for you young-uns), mixed with a whodunit detective story is just great to watch. Like reading a mystery novel. I have watched this movie so many times I'm surprised it's not worn out my player. The tenacity of Woodward & Bernstein is inspiring, and a testament to the good old days when you could just show up at someone's doorstep and visit (or, interrogate ;) The lack of any technology to assist these guys in their search makes it all the more admirable; they had to convince a librarian and sweet-talk a former lover for key investigative leads. No internet here, and no voice mail either. I can't say I love what Bob Woodward has turned into, but I respect what he did in those days.",All the President's Men
235,lincolnhamlin2012,Perspective from a young person who's studying Watergate,8,4 January 2014,"All the President's Men tells the story of two Washington Post reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, as they try to uncover the Watergate cover up. Based on the book of the same title, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play Woodward and Bernstein respectively. A quick warning: viewers looking for a film on the Watergate scandal should look elsewhere; this one focuses more on the reporting and role of the media, and in fact, Nixon is only seen a couple of times in stock footage. With that warning out of the way, let's get to the review!From the very beginning, the movie demonstrates a great amount of attention to detail on behalf of the makers of the movie. Down to the smallest detail, factual accuracy was sought for in this movie, making it an entertaining yet informative view of Watergate from a journalistic perspective. For example, when Woodward calls the White House, the number he dials is actually the number to the White House switchboard. The creators went to great lengths to ensure that the newspaper set was accurate, including the people in it and the events which transpired. The film is truly an accurate look into how a newspaper is run.In addition to attention to detail, the acting in the movie is superb. Robert Redford successfully displays different emotions convincingly, and plays the part in an entertaining way. Dustin Hoffman also plays his character well, though I enjoyed Redford's performance more. Besides the top billed actors, Jason Robards does a fine job playing Ben Bradlee, the editor of the Washington Post. Bradlee left big shoes to fill, but Robards played him convincingly, emanating the qualities which enabled Bradlee to reach his position. Jane Alexander, despite having no more than ten minutes of screen time, perfectly depicted the Bookkeeper and was in fact nominated for an Academy Award for her role. Overall, the actors blend together well and are very convincing in their roles.Having watched this in 2013, I expected it to be somewhat dated and perhaps cheesy. However, this was not the case at all. The movie has a fast paced plot which has action at every turn. The often parodied parking garage meetings between Woodward and one informant, Deep Throat, had a tense atmosphere and wasn't at all cheesy or whimsical. Despite the fact that Watergate happened before I was born, I was still able to enjoy the plot and relate to the characters. From other reviewers' takes, I know that audiences from the 1970s also enjoyed the film. For a movie to hold up that well over time, especially a movie based on a current event, is truly a sign of greatness. Viewers from any time period, any previous depth of knowledge on Watergate, and any political affiliation will enjoy this fast paced film.Besides all these technical reasons to bestow the four stars, there's a simple one: it's entertaining! For someone who doesn't know much about Watergate, the plot turns will be unpredictable, and a huge mistake the reporters make in the very end will catch them completely off guard. For someone like me, someone who studies Watergate and has read the book, it was fun to test my knowledge of the people, and also it helped me visualize the people that I couldn't visualize before. Yet I did not give this film five stars, and there is a reason for this. The film only covers the first half of the book, and ends way before the reporters' role in Watergate was over. This in and of itself is not an issue, the issue is where they decided to split the book. At the end of the movie, where they split the book in two and only filmed the first half, Woodward and Bernstein make a huge mistake reporting on H. R. Haldeman, and are criticized severely. In the book, they vindicate themselves later and get to the bottom of Watergate. In the movie, after the mistake, it just shows the reporters in the newsroom with a TV showing the second Nixon inauguration, and cuts to a view of a typewriter writing out the indictments that would later come. Basically, the second half of the book, in which the reporters bounce back, is reduced to a few sentences by a typewriter announcing indictments.But overall, I enjoyed this movie. The ending will not bother you if you haven't read the book, and if you have, it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie's greatness. Everything else about All the President's Men is superb. This film deserves four stars.",All the President's Men

At the same time it is a genuine creativity and milestone in the Hollywood history. Both the movie and the actual story shines over the so called todays PRESS and paparazzi culture. In the event of darkness was about to fall Washington Post stood firm on their principals of truth which incident has now became an IDOL for every news paper where shallow values are elevating and getting prestige on the name of page 3. Whole of the saga on the screen definitely gave justice to all that happened. The direction and flow of story deeply moves you even after 25 years has passed. What to say about Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford, in fact every actor and character in the movie is flawless. By looking at the Washington post office in the movie, we really feel to become a journalist.

I wasn't disappointed. The movie is full of suspense, drama, and excitement. The continuous shot which shows Robert Redford (Woodward) on the phone talking to various people and messes up the names but stays in character is amazing. The naturalness of the dialogue (which apparently came from Redford and Dustin Hoffman memorizing each other's lines) makes you forget you're watching a movie. Jason Robards almost steals the show as Ben Bradlee. I understand why he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Overall, a fantastic movie, and if you liked Good Night and Good Luck, you'll like this.",All the President's Men
