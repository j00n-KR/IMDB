0,Leofwine_draca,"Enjoyable, if flawed",6,17 February 2019,"MILE 22 is another movie featuring Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg teaming up with actor-turned director Peter Berg; I watched their DEEPWATER HORIZON last year and really enjoyed it, so was hoping for a lot from this. Sadly, the end result is something of a mixed bag. The story is okay (similar to NO ESCAPE crossed with 16 BLOCKS) but the script is quite poor, which leads to incessant profanity and a mildly annoying character performance from Wahlberg, although Lauren Cohan is better.The film moves at a fair old clip, which is a definite plus, and features the undeniable talents of martial arts superstar Iko Uwais. He lets rip in a couple of fight scenes that manage to overcome the shaky cam and quickfire editing thanks to their sheer speed and brutality. The second half of the movie picks up nicely and if it does end on a bit of a silly twist then we can still forgive it that, but given the resources available here I'd expected something more of an action classic. MILE 22 is fun, but not something you'd want to watch on repeat (like THE RAID films, for example).",Mile 22
1,SnoopyStyle,action yelling action,4,13 November 2018,"James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) leads an American black ops tactical unit. They destroy a Russian unit hiding in the American suburbs. Sixteen months later, they are in Indocarr City in pursuit of stolen caesium following team member Alice Kerr (Lauren Cohan)'s faulty intel. Her source walks into the Embassy with the real locations but demands asylum in America. His corrupt government wants him back, dead or alive.Everybody is aggressively pissed off. It's trying to use that in place of an inventive original plot. The fast-paced yelling is artificial and the plot is little more than an excuse for non-stop action. At some point probably when Ronda Rousey blew herself up, my eyes glazed over. They don't try a decoy or helicopters. There's no reason why the locals wouldn't send more people at their five men team. There is also the big twist at the end. It's nice poetry but the plan doesn't actually make sense in reality even if one understands it.",Mile 22
2,Prismark10,One for Uwais fans,4,2 November 2018,"Mile 22 has a great tagline on its posters but it is really is a disappointing action film that lacks thrills. After the initial action in the opening scenes, nothing much happens for a while before the pace picks up.James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) is an ace CIA recruit with some bipolar issues. He heads an elite team of agents who at the beginning of the film kill a Russian cell operating in the US.Some months later Silva and his team need to extract to safety a police officer Li Noor (Iko Uwais) who has surrendered himself at the US embassy. He has negotiated safe passage in exchange for a code that can disarm a dirty bomb. It is a case of whether they can trust Noor and can he deliver?Wahlberg's character is irritating. Ronda Rousey seems to be wasted, I hardly saw her having any fight scenes. It is left to Uwais for the best fight action and he brings an element of his most famous film The Raid in one particular segment where the team are trapped in an apartment block.",Mile 22
3,nogodnomasters,I've lied to every person I have ever met.,5,4 September 2018,"James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) is intelligent and has issues socializing. He likes to kill so he is recruited by the CIA. After an opening introduction of characters where James shoots a Russian teen, it moves to the fictional city of Inocarr, South East Asia. (Filmed in Bogata). His partner Alice (Lauren Cohan) has long distant child custody issues. There is an issue of dirty bomb material that needs to be located. I believe they initially said it was 4 pounds of Cs-137 which is easily detectable and fatal to anyone carrying it around unshielded. Then later the isotope changed to Cs-139 which has a very short half-life as does its daughter product. It would not make a very effect dirty bomb and would not be worth the effort to locate because it would all decay away in a day. A man (Iko Uwais) shows up at the embassy who claims to have the locations of the Cesium on a disc that the CIA cannot unlock without the password. The man wants to give us the code, but will not until he is on an airplane to the US. That is where the title of the film comes in. It is 22 miles to the airport and everyone in Bogata, or where ever, wants him dead. Our maniac Bourne guy getting him there is the film. John Malkovich is his contact, but his CIA is not as fun without Bruce Willis and Helen Mirren. I never felt for the characters. The life of Silva flashed across the screen during the opening credits, so if you are getting popcorn, you missed all the character development. He wasn't likable. Now what the film is attempting to tell us is the Russians are killing us in cyber warfare and at some point in time can escalate it into a hot war. Currently, our top agents battling against the Russians are leaving the force either voluntarily or are being forced out. Their names have made the news. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",Mile 22
4,kosmasp,Walking distance?,8,4 March 2019,"Sometimes the smallest distance may seem like a marathon. For some the movie itself may feel like it is dragging. Especially for those who are guessing (or trying to guess) where this is heading. No pun intended. The movie itself has a pace though that is quite exhausting. It's close to non stop action and even when there is no stunts, the dialog is as fast and the edits do the rest.If that is something you like or not, is up to you to decide. If you don't mind a story that is ambigious, that will test you (in more than one way) and a movie that might dissapoint you or go places you don't like ... well here it is. It can be uncomfortable and it may be bleak (to a degree) - don't put this on the movie. Decide if it is for you and enjoy the ride, if you can",Mile 22
5,classicsoncall,"""I think there is no defense against someone willing to die.""",7,29 August 2019,"The movie doesn't help itself in the early going when principal characters refer to each other by both their real names and their code names. The frantic back and forth of the opening scene demonstrates this, only to be carried forward into the rest of the story. Eventually, the patient viewer will be able to figure things out, but it takes a while. One example - actor John Malkovich goes by Bishop and his black ops monicker 'Mother'. The pace at which the story moves makes it difficult at first to know who's who. Things settle a bit by the time the unit led by James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) gets their assignment to extract a rogue police officer from an Indonesian city. His price in exchange for removal is a password that will unlock a tape that contains the locations of a deadly 'fear powder', cesium-139, with the potential to wipe out an entire city with no more than simple exposure.Fans of unrelenting action will find the pace exciting and potentially confusing at the same time; one downside of being on the good guy team is that one can be left behind if mortally wounded when an urgent time frame must be met. Sam Snow (Ronda Rousey) found out the hard way, but at least she got to take out a couple adversaries. A lot of the thrill here is provided by Iko Uwais as the rogue cop being delivered to Mile 22; his martial arts skills are impeccable and the choreography required to pull off some of his stunts is mind blowing. That first scene in the hospital where he escapes his attackers is incredible, something you shouldn't try at home.Overall a fast paced film with Wahlberg's character probably being more of a hard ass than he needed to be given his leadership position. The fate of team member Alice Kerr (Lauren Cohan) is left somewhat ambiguous for those who like things told in a straightforward manner, but that just adds to the surreal nature of the story. The twist ending will also upset one's equilibrium if you like your stories with the good guys coming out on top. That will have to wait for another day.",Mile 22
6,michaelRokeefe,Action filled confusion,6,30 December 2018,"Non-stop action and a highly energetic story taking its tempo from Mark Wahlberg, CIA operative James Silva, that leads a little-known highly prized unit on a special ops job of delivering a vital informant to an airfield for extraction. It is like ""cat and mouse"" shoot-outs running willy-nilly racing the clock as enemy personage close in. A rambling Wahlberg can cause extra tension, if not take your mind off of trying to figure out a plot. I was hoping for Ronda Rousey to have a more ""meatier"" role, since she was one reason why I wanted to watch this movie. John Malkovich's character leads to the question...why?Peter Berg directs and the cast also features: Lauren Cohan, Iko Uwais, Sam Madenia, Natasha Goubskaya, Keith Arthur Bolden and Carlo Alban.",Mile 22
7,CinemaSerf,Adequate action thriller we've all seen before.,6,30 April 2021,"I usually find with these sorts of films that the more basic the underlying premiss, the more likely the plot is to get into all sorts of convoluted scenarios that ensure everything that could possibly go wrong does. This is one of those stories. It tells of a squad of American CIA operatives trying to repair some damage caused by an earlier botched mission involving the Russian FSB, and now having to rescue a man with some top secret nuclear information out of South East Asia. Extraction expert Mark Walhberg (""Silva"") leads this team with help from remotely located uber-boffin John Malkovich (""Bishop"") and his own formidable deputy ""Alice"" (Lauren Cohen) as they are pursued by the local authorities (as ever the CIA don't let local law get in the way of their operations - friend or foe) as well as those who do not want their package to be safely delivered and therefore to thwart their devastating terror attack. It is certainly an action-packed adventure with plenty of pyrotechnics, shoot outs and enough duplicity to keep the escaping team unsure as to whom they can trust right until the end. It's not rubbish, but is entirely derivative and though there is suspense as to who is betraying who, the production standards are nothing to write home about, the editing is clunky and far too busy and the dialogue comes straight from the floor of a ""Mission Impossible"" script meeting. Passes the time, but instantly forgettable.",Mile 22
8,grantss,"Bland, irritating, largely plotless, one-dimensional action-thriller",3,18 February 2020,"At the US embassy in a South East Asian country, a man turns up offering secrets with enormous benefits to the US. Now a crack team of CIA agents must get him out of the city so that he can be extracted by air. The journey will be incredibly dangerous.Incredibly bad. Plot is very basic and is really just a spine to hang heaps of explosions and action sequences on. Throw in every military and action cliché and now it is very familiar and predictable.Worst of all, you have a script written entirely to enable Mark Wahlberg to act ultra alpha, complete with trite dialogue, aggressive posturing and basically behaving like a powerful, know-it-all, self-important idiot. His performance and character are off-the-charts irritating.Avoid.",Mile 22
9,oscaralbert,What would happen IF Russia knew all U.S. secrets . . .,8,20 August 2018,". . . MILE 22 asks. It would be the End of Life of We Knew It, MILE 22 suggests. Of the 58 Americans shown during MILE 22, only ""Marky Mark"" survives. Red Commie Russia and its barbaric smirking allies slaughter everyone else in the course of MILE 22. The devious KGB plot outlined throughout MILE 22 is simply a prologue to a brutal sneak attack planned for our USA Homeland (as well as London, Paris, Rome, and Athens) designed to spread Cesium 29, turning millions of innocent folks into Jello and making the Free World uninhabitable for the next 160,000 years, MILE 22's background images document. For the purpose of time (and the filmmakers' self-preservation against the Real Life threats of the venal, revenge-obsessed KGB Crime Lord ""Mad Vlad"" and his mobster mouthpiece in our White House), MILE 22 does NOT show us exactly HOW the amoral Russian psychopaths obtain America's secrets. Certainly we all KNOW in our hearts that a Kremlin-rigged ""election"" elevated a New York City gangster (recruited as a teen at Reform School by the far-sighted KGB) into the core of the U.S. Government, allowing this Russian ""mole"" to meet alone recently with Mad Vlad in Helsinki and compromise America forever.",Mile 22
10,neil-476,"All bread, no filling",6,20 September 2018,"Aggressive achiever Silva works for a clandestine organisation called Overwatch which is tasked with moving a local police officer the 22 miles from the embassy where he has sought asylum to the plane to take him to the USA, at which point he will hand over the code to unlock the time-critical computer file containing incredibly important information.This is essentially The Gauntlet with a plot nailed to it. The plot is adequate, if unexceptional, as it provides something on which to hang a series of car chases, shoot-outs and martial arts sequences. There are a couple of twists (well, one) and a basis for a sequel. The action is handled well, but gets a bit monotonous after a while.Mark Wahlberg does aggressive intensity quite well, Iko Uwais is the inscrutable informant Li Noor, and Lauren Cohan is sympathetic as the colleague with upsetting personal issues which have no plot relevance other than to make us root for her during a sequence where she seems in particular jeopardy, the other team members having been killed in order of how well the actors are known.This is an OK action thriller, nothing more.",Mile 22
11,ferguson-6,say it loudly,5,16 August 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. I like secrets too! By definition, information is scarce on these teams, so Secret Ops units are perfect fodder for intrigue, espionage, and geopolitical action flicks. A fictional account of an elite paramilitary unit chasing down Russian spies is not only timely, but also timeless. Director Peter Berg and actor Mark Wahlberg are back for their 4th testosterone-laced collaboration. Their previous work included PATRIOTS DAY, DEEPWATER HORIZON, and LONE SURVIVOR, each with an element of truth to their story. Not so with their latest ... at least we hope not.Mark Wahlberg stars as Mark Wahlberg, er... James Silva, a child prodigy with anger issues who has grown into a military intelligence prodigy with anger issues and a rubber band. Silva snaps the rubber band on his wrist when his impatience bubbles up as those around him can't keep up with his rapid-fire thinking. The only thing that works faster than Silva's brain is his motor-mouth filled with cryptic cuts and curses. Lest you think this is another men's only club, writers Lea Carpenter and Graham Roland have blessed us with two female action figures. One is played by MMA star Ronda Rousey. She is given little to do here. The other is Lauren Cohan (""The Walking Dead"") who, as team member Alice Kerr, has much to do - even beyond the absentee-mommy guilt burdening her.Carlo Alban plays another member of the elite squad, while John Malkovich plays ""Mother"", the flat-top toupeed control center leader ... you knew there had to be an ultra-high-tech lair staffed with computer nerds. Since Wahlberg spends most of the movie yelling, and Cohan battles her estranged husband (Peter Berg cameo) over Skype, the most interesting character is Li Noor, played by Iko Uwais (THE RAID). Uwais brings a Bruce Lee quality to the film with an incredible hospital room fight scene, as well as a few other sequences that will have you marvel at his abilities. Intensity and tension and violence and gun play and fighting and chase scenes are jam-packed into a relatively short run time, but the opening sequence is the closest thing we get to something that fits into a well-written espionage thriller. The team sets up a raid on a Russian FSB suburban safe house. Things get twisted, and the final kill ends with ""you're making a mistake"". The film then jumps ahead two years to the Overwatch team reassembling in Southeast Asia for a mission to transport Li Noor to an airfield 22 miles away. See, he holds the information regarding dirty bombs that can either save or cost thousands of lives.The film features a framing device with Silva being debriefed after the mission. He is explaining why they do the important work they do and why they did the important work they did and why it's important that we understand the work is important. There is government bashing and military cheerleading, but mostly the interview acts as a respite between violent action sequences. The film plays so much like a video game that each ticket should come with a joystick. If after watching this, you need more, you'll be pleased to know there's a cheesy line at the end that tees up the sequel ... and don't worry, director Berg and Mr. Wahlberg are already in pre-production for their fifth film.",Mile 22
12,bombersflyup,Not good.,2,26 February 2019,"Mile 22 is a film without fun or feeling, just action sequences. Nonstop, but dull.Lots of quick talking on top one another, with nothing to say. Never taking the time to invest in anything. The dialogue, characters and acting all subpar. Watch 2018's ""Den of Thieves,"" if you want a quality action thriller.",Mile 22
13,FlashCallahan,Keep snapping the band Mark......,7,26 September 2018,"CIA operative James Silva leads a small paramilitary team on a mission to transport a foreign intelligence asset from an American embassy in Southeast Asia to an airfield for extraction -- a distance of 22 miles. Silva and the soldiers soon find themselves in a race against time as the city's military, police and street gangs close in to reclaim the asset.......Even though the film has had negative feedback from many critics, Berg and Wahlberg have delivered what they have set out to make, a straight to the point no nonsense action film that doesn't try to be too clever for its own good.Once again, the pairing of director and star is wonderful and this is just as gripping as their other outings.Wahlberg is great as the highly unlikable team leader with a plethora of mental health issues, but he's a professional and straight to the point, pretty much like the narrative of the film.But what's so refreshing is to see an 18 rated film here in the UK actually get a cinema release. It's been an absolute age since an action film has received a cinema release with this rating, and it's as refreshing as Logan and Deadpool not going for the family friendly rating.The action at times is edited within an inch of its life, which is a shame, especially when Uwais is such a showstopper.Malkovich and Wig offer support, and although one plot point gets tossed away, all characters feel more than just throw away characters. It's suitably tense, and sometimes funny (especially before the group take to the road), and if your an action fan, it's a pretty decent 90 minutes.It's not going to win any awards for originality, and the promise of a continuation may be a little premature, but it never outstays it's welcome.And if this film was made 12 years ago, it would have starred Bruce Willis and Mos Def........Oh wait a minute.......",Mile 22
14,phd_travel,Totally unexpected Asian style action thriller - quite good actually,8,16 August 2018,This movie is an unexpected surprise and an original combination of different international talents. First of all it's an action movie set in Asia with Asian style action filmed in Latin America with an American star and and American director. The movie is set in a supposed South East Asian city and the locals speak Indonesian. The main action is shouldered by the Indonesian actor Iko Uwais. It's Jackie Chan Jet Li style action. Mark Wahlberg simply takes a back seat. The director Peter Berg (of 13 Hours) does a bit of a 13 Hours thing here and it's quite exciting as they are cornered in their escape route. There are Russian spies and vaguely Indonesian bad guys.The story if you wait till the end is actually quite good. Things tie up and there is a twist. The outcome really makes everything worthwhile. There is some irritating incessant dialog that distracts a bit. Worth watching.,Mile 22
15,mm-39,6 out of 10 is about right!,6,30 August 2018,"6 out of 10 is about right. Mile 22 What worked: The ending had quite a twist. Many of the physical fight sequences were well executed. A bid budget with planes etc nothing lacking with scenes, props, A list actors. What did not work: Too much personal information, family problems which did little for character development and were a drag on the story. Awful dialogue which is over bearing; Too much swearing etc more flash with little intelligence. Too talk jockish would be the word. Many of the gun fight scenes are seen it, done it before, and impossible too digest. Unbelievable script with a lack of imagination. The middle part of the script is like watching The Walking Dead people get over run killed etc same old same old. Over all Mile 22 is a nothing here there there movie. Watchable but forgettable. 6 out of 10 stars.",Mile 22
16,deloudelouvain,It's just not good.,4,28 November 2018,"I didn't like very much about this movie, almost nothing. I wish I did, but unfortunately there are too much bad things about this movie to make it an enjoyable action movie. First of all the story, which is confusing, not very elaborated, and most of the time boring to watch. Then you have the characters, that are like the story, boring to watch. And it's not the couple action scenes that will save this movie. Half of the time I didn't know what they were on about, and most of the time I didn't even care what they were on about. Mark Wahlberg played in alot of good movies, but this is not one of them.",Mile 22
17,ksf-2,Malkovich. and marky mark.,7,25 April 2021,"Mark Wahlberg and the awesome Malkovich. Rhonda Rousey, mostly known for WWE wrestling. Wahlberg is Silva, a black ops guy who must locate and escort a foreign national from the U. S. embassy to the U. S. the talented Malky is Bishop, Silva's handler. The first half hour is kind of annoying; one agent has a meltdown. One has to deal with someone who may be a nutjob, and one keeps snapping the plastic band on their wrist. None of these has anything to do with the story. Except to show us how whacked they all are. SO much swearing. Li Noor ( Iko Uwais) claims he knows where the missing cesium is, but will only tell them if they meet his demands. And Silva continues to rant and yell at everyone. It was so annoying i muted it and turned on captions. If i had paid to see this in a theater, i probably would have left and asked for my money back. Uwais clearly trained for this part... between the martial arts and his body tone, just acting the scene in the medical bay shows how prepared he is. Next challenge is to get Li on the plane out of the country... and that's not easy. He must be very important. Directed by Peter Berg, who had researched CIA ops for an earlier film. Story by Graham Roland and Lea Carpenter. The story is good, but i'd recommend muting it while Wahlberg rants and raves.",Mile 22
18,Hellmant,If you like action you'll get what you came for.,8,31 August 2018,"'MILE 22': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as the leader of an elite CIA task force, that must risk everything to smuggle an Indonesian police officer, with very valuable information, out of the country. It was directed by Peter Berg (marking Wahlberg and Berg's forth film collaboration together), and it was written by Lea Carpenter and Graham Roland. The movie costars Iko Uwais, Lauren Cohan, John Malkovich and Ronda Rousey. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also disappointed at the Box Office as well. I enjoyed the action scenes in it, and I really liked the film anytime Uwais is on screen (he's amazing). Wahlberg is not very good in it though, and Berg has directed many better movies than this.

20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,As misfiring as any of the bullets fired at Whalberg and co.,2,7 March 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter leading his select, elite team in a mission that went wrong involving a Russian mob boss a few years ago, Agent James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) must now contend with his neurotic partner Alice (Lauren Cohen), who's missing her daughter, his domineering boss Bishop (John Malkovich), and Li Noor (Iko Uwais), a man possessing some vital information, who will only reveal it if he is granted asylum in the US. The trouble is, an entire criminal network are determined to keep him silent, and will stop at nothing to stop him making his journey.Although he's branched out into other genres (and made a fairly good impression in them) Mark Wahlberg is one of those actors who has always remained best suited to grunting, tough guy roles, as they remain the best outlet for him to project his seemingly in-built intensity into, even in light-hearted films such as The Other Guys. Mile 22, from director Peter Berg, with whom he collaborated on several other films, including Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon and Patriot's Day, seems built to cater to his style of delivery, but it is a dreadful misfire, that will probably only please his most undemanding fans.Some of the most memorable action heroes have short, snappy quips that have kept them memorable over the years, but here Wahlberg's character appears to be saddled with a load of heavy, overly laborious dialogue, which he barks to the camera with a maniacal madness that any Shakspearian thespian couldn't muster. And so, we turn to his co star, Indonesian martial arts sensation Kuwais, who no one expects any Oscar worthy acting from, but who delivers the goods with his incredible high flying kicks and punches.Sadly, that, and some decent action sequences are not enough to compensate for a lame script, with characters with no development or substance who you'll care nothing for, and a plot that fails to keep you hooked in any way. Even with a pretty compact running time, it still manages to be a long, sluggish affair you'll need to take a break from at least once. *",Mile 22
21,MOscarbradley,One of the best action flics in a long while.,7,28 February 2020,"We all know Peter Berg doesn't make 'nice' films but he does make highly watchable ones, and usually very violent ones, and ""Mile 22"" is one of his best. The plot is ridiculously simple and at the same time, ridiculously complex; blame that on Berg's cutting whereby if we blink we might miss reams of crucial information. All you need to know is that it's set in Indonesia and is about a group of American operatives attempting to get an Indonesian cop with a valued secret out of the country. Oh, and the Russians are also involved.As an action flic it's close to perfect though Mark Wahlberg's nasty, chip-on-his-shoulder operative in charge is possibly the least likeable action hero in recent memory while John Malkovitch is reduced to another of his cameos as the guy directing things from HQ. As the cop Iko Uwais has little to do but look buffed and do some very nifty (and nasty) kung fu fighting. And yes, it does pay homage to ""The Raid"" but then we always knew it would. Slowing the pace might have helped, particularly when it comes to figuring out who is doing what to who, but lovers of appallingly violent action pictures will have a field day.",Mile 22
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It's the worst thing Peter Berg has made by a mile, and he directed 'Battleship'.",3,19 September 2018,"If you didn't know any better, you'd be forgiven for thinking that director Peter Berg is a first-timer because the construction of 'Mile 22 (2018)' is, frankly, amateurish at best and woefully miscalculated at worst. Given the guy's previously good credits, I'd hazard a guess towards the latter and say that these poor choices are purposeful ones made in an attempt to ape that apparently all-important (but, at this point, played-out and 'old hat') quick-cut 'Greengrass' style. The flick's biggest problem really is its editing because it's just plain awful; it's pervasively choppy and difficult-to-follow even in the most simple of dialogue-based scenes. It makes the whole thing quite hard to watch, never-mind follow from a narrative perspective, while also removing any impact that the action-sequences could possibly have had. It's a real shame that Iko Uwais' excellent choreography, which he performs himself, is cut up like this. The failure of the action is major issue when the piece is, for all intents and purposes, an action-film. Yet, every action set-piece feels like a chore and you just want it to be over so you can actually see what's going on again. Without these sequences, however, the picture essentially has nothing going for it, since the plot is meant purely as a vehicle for all the violence. The characters are cardboard cut-outs characterised by single traits or stuffed-in sub-plots. Plus, Mark Wahlberg's leading man is as unlikable a protagonist as has graced our screens in the past year, one who's constantly cussing out his colleagues for daring to get caught under enemy fire or have a birthday. The most annoying thing about the movie is that, if it were helmed better and had some tweaks to its characters, its simple story could've been an excellent catalyst for a tense, exciting action-thriller with well-choreographed fight-scenes - something similar to 'The Raid (2011)'. Overall, this is an experience that feels hollow, almost incompetent and, to be honest, like a waste of time. It's the worst film Peter Berg, who's been on quite the winning streak with Wahlberg lately, has made by a mile and, let's not forget, he directed 'Battleship (2012)'. 3/10",Mile 22

There's little set-up, not much character depth, and a serious lack of emotional punch in this action thriller. Oh, and the shaky cam Peter Berg decides to use? Downright awful. You can hardly tell what's going on,They cast one of the best international action stars of this decade Iko Uwais, and never even gave him a chance to showcase his skills. This is not to mention the fact that not a single one of these characters are likable, especially Wahlberg, who spends the length of the movie yelling at his supporting characters and never showing a lick of likability. I couldn't stand watching this movie.1.9/10",Mile 22
24,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,5,14 November 2018,"Mile 22The hardest part of working for a clandestine organization is getting them to believe that you work there every morning.Fortunately, the top-secret team leader in this action-thriller is not easily forgotten.Labeled a violent offender at a young age, James (Mark Wahlberg) had to learn to control his anger and channel his aggression into something useful, like heading up a covert black ops team (John Malkovich, Lauren Cohan, Ronda Rousey) tasked with keeping a radioactive chemical from being weaponized by terrorists. But in order to do that James must help an Indonesian police officer (Iko Uwais) in possession of the substance flee from authorities.While it's loaded with shoot-outs, car chases and choreographed fights, this spy thriller is light on espionage. Meanwhile, Iko Uwais' martial art talents are adversely affected by the hurried editing.Incidentally, the only way to escape Indonesia undetected is disguising yourself as a Komodo dragon. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Mile 22
25,westsideschl,Interesting Twist,7,29 November 2018,"Positives:
A bit exaggerated but fairly accurate showing of special ops using high tech surveillance & control capabilities in taking out an international (Russian in this case, of course) spy/terrorist safe house in an attempt to stop some radioactive material (as usual or biological) from being dispersed into cities killing tens-of-thousands (why the Russians would be doing this makes no sense, or I misunderstood the storyline). Actually, not sure why anyone group would do this outside of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc.
Main positives: An, at times, look at U.S. special ops in a not flattering light. Other positive was the twist at the end.
Negatives: Killing, around 40 supposed baddies who may actually have been goodies given the twist at the end. Around a dozen goodies dispatched. Unknown number of innocents (as in most movies of this type a young girl is protected from the onslaught).
Main negative: The lack of clarity w/possibly editing being a part of the problem, and also the script in delaying the twisty to the end.
Conclusion: I think they're going for a sequel, but given the negatives they need to script to viewers who are fast food consumers - no thinking, quick & dirty.",Mile 22
26,851222,Dissapointing,6,5 February 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Mile 22"" (2018) was very disappointing generic action flick. Disappointing first of all because i highly enjoy Peter Berg's movies, and directing of this movie wasn't really good. Its way to poorly edited and action sequences are nearly impossible to follow because of poor camera work and more poor editing. The ending was kinda surprisingly not bad, with a twist and that saved this movie for me from a lower rating.Overall, ""Mile 22"" is generic, very poorly crafted action flick. The main hero was kinda joke - there wasn't anyone to root for for the entire 1 h 29 min. Very disappointing movie.",Mile 22

Peter Berg has cool style in most of his work, for example Patriots Day and he had a small role in Smokin Aces. Just don't mind that this has some flat writing, the other aspects overrule that! This also has a decent cast - I love John Malkovich in almost anything and Ronda Rousey is new to acting as of the last few years I think she's pretty badass; like it or love it this is a cool movie.",Mile 22
29,cruise01,"Mindless action which is good and bad cause it is a bit chaotic, exhausting, and forgettable.",5,17 August 2018,"Mile 22 (2.5 out of 5 stars).Mile 22 is an adrenaline rush action thriller that leaves you feeling a little exhausted from its shaky cam, rushed plot, and poor dialogue. Peter Berg direction is on steroids with his quick fast editing cuts in every action scene that makes Jason Bourne movies or Michael Bay's action seem more still. Which is not a good thing for Mile 22. Peter Berg does build some intensity that keeps your heart pumping in such a short run time with the film. He did great in Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. Mile 22 fails to be an exciting great movie. The plot was convoluted. It follows James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) who is a paramilitary operative in an organization called Overwatch. When his team invades what they think is a Russian KGB hideout house and the mission goes sideways. A year or so later, James and his team are assigned to escort Li Noor (Iko Uwais) 22 miles to the airport for extraction. Cause Li Noor has valuable intel that can be life threatening to the nation. While on their transport they get invaded by assassins, and another paramilitary group that will stop at nothing to kill Li Noor. I thought the plot and direction of the movie was a little lost on what it was trying to be. Story wise it kind of sucked when there was barely much of a story. You have a fast talking James Silva, who can explode with his mania personality at any given moment. He is hard with his team which they can barely keep up. Especially, Alice (Lauren Cohan) who is struggling with a divorce and custody battle. But James informs her that she is distracted and will lose sight of their job. Then, there is a sub plot of a Russian terrorist that are on a plane with an agenda as they watch surveillance of this escort on Li Noor. And than Li Noor, who has info of the terrorist having a biohazard material that is an attack waiting to happen. The film has a twist that gives you the chills and a cliffhanger ending that leaves for a sequel. The direction sucked with this movie. The cinematography work was consist of shaky camera movement and fast editing. The fight scene with Iko Uwais attacking others was confusing. The shootouts were loud, and a bang but it gets very repetitive throughout. James and his team are on a long 22 mile journey that is consist of cars blowing up, shoot outs, running into a building with more shoot outs and close combat fighting. And repeat. I like most Peter Berg films. Yes, he does well building up the intensity with the movie. But this one does get a little boring with its narration when it cuts between action scenes to James Silva being interviewed on what went wrong with their mission. Or when it cuts to surveillance videos of the action from the drone or street cameras. It can be annoying. Mark Wahlberg was great though as the fast talking and maniac character. John Malkovich was okay too with sitting behind the monitors watching the action unfold. Lauren Cohan was okay as well with hands on action. Iko Uwais is like the next Jet Li or Jackie Chan when it comes to fighting. And Ronda Rousey barely had much to do with some brief action scenes.Overall, Mile 22 is a bad film. Mark Wahlberg was good and yes the film could be a start of a franchise. Peter Berg's fast editing direction that gets lost with its action scenes between quick camera movements to surveillance cameras can be tedious after awhile. The poor plotting that needs to have a twist to make it better just feels like the film did not have a story at all. I was a little left disappointed and the film is forgettable.",Mile 22
30,Floated2,Generic action thriller,4,22 April 2019,"Not much to be said about Mile 22. From director Peter Berg and the fourth collaboration between him and Mark Wahlberg there was most definitely going to be some warrant into seeing the film. However after watching this film, it is easily their worst pairing together.The action was nothing special besides a few scenes involving the character of Li Noor (Iko Uwais), who stole his scenes and was the highlight of the film. The performance by Wahlberg was quite annoying and over the top to say the least, as he is normally reduced but in this film the character was just too over the top and hard the root for. Ronda Rousey didn't have much of any action scenes which was disappointing.This is a film which should have been better but as a whole felt somewhat rushed and nothing special to show for it. Also not surprising as this film did poorly at the box office. Rather better off watching Lone Survivor or Patriots Day if in the mood for one of Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg's better collaborations. As a rewatch 06/15/20' enjoyed this film slightly more than the initial watch. Few good action sequences by Iko Uwais but not enough and not as thrilling as it could have been.",Mile 22
31,eddie_baggins,A new low for the Wahlberg/Berg partnership,3,15 April 2019,"I'm not sure what happened to the filmmaker that made 2004 High School football classic Friday Night Lights, but I know I want him back.After reaching the grand heights of his 2004 grand opus, actor turned director Peter Berg has been almost constantly churning out films of various quality, from the bad (Battleship), the disappointing (Hancock) to the highly entertaining (Deepwater Horizon) but his never managed to properly showcase that his football heavy hitter wasn't a one-off.Finding a partner in crime in the form of Hollywood mega-star Mark Wahlberg, Mile 22 marks the 4th time in 5 years the actor and director have worked together and while the other results have been solid, if mildly forgettable, Mile 22 is a new low-point in their creative partnership.A wannabe franchise starter that features Wahlberg at his annoying worst as highly-strung and emotionally non-existent crack government agent James Silva, Mile 22 is a mess of an action movie that takes Berg's signature in your face documentary like direction and turns it into 90 minutes of near incomprehensible action sequences, as Silva and his team look to extract The Raid star Iko Uwais traitorous Li Noor back to America before a potential terrorist attack throws the world into chaos.It's impossible to understand why Mile 22 was directed and edited in the way it was, giving it the feeling that it's made by a bunch of amateurish ADHD suffering wannabe filmmakers, that when partnered with Lea Carpenter's atrocious and expletive ridden script (of which includes gems like ""no birthday cake"") and a collection of bemused looking performances, makes for quite the mind-numbing cinematic offering.You get the feeling Berg and Wahlberg jumped headfirst into this production with very little care, thought or planning and even though it's great to see a superstar like Uwais appear here (as actor and also action choreographer), you wonder what the point of it all is when Berg and his production team are hell-bent on over editing and cutting everything to pieces so your never even given time to comprehend who or what you're watching.The disappointment of the film overall is also another downward trend for Wahlberg, who outside of the perfectly average Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day has been treading water of late with Mile 22 sitting comfortably alongside the likes of Daddy's Home 2, Transformers: The Last Knight, All the Money in the World and The Gambler as recent misfires and travesty's.Final Say -It's likely we will never get to see Mile 23 and that's a great thing for all of us, as Berg and Walhberg's wannabe action hit is a total misfire and a film your best off skipping if you want to avoid a headache and nausea.1 ½ wrist bands out of 5",Mile 22
32,leonblackwood,"Surprisingly enjoyable, for a Wahlberg movie! 7/10",7,26 May 2019,"Review:
I surprisingly enjoyed this film, about a middle-aged CIA Officer and former U.S. Marine war veteran, James Silva (Mark Wahlberg), who leads a Special Activities Division team code-named Overwatch to raid a Russian FSB safe house in the United States. Under the remote supervision of James Bishop (John Malkovich) and his team, the mission is to locate and destroy shipments of caesium before the highly radioactive substance can be weaponised. Once I got to grips with the plot, I was able to enjoy the fast-paced action, which was pretty intense, but I was surprised to see Wahlberg take a backseat in this one. Most of his team did the hard work, while he's barking harsh orders to them, and his unsympathetic attitude, due to Asperger does go a bit far. Once Li Noor (Iko Uwais) is introduced to the plot, the whole movie steps up a gear, and the brilliant fighting scenes and intense shoot-outs made the movie a frill ride. It's nothing out of the ordinary, like the Raid which made Iko a star, but the non-stop action and various twists in the plot towards the end did make it stand out from the rest in 2018. One of the problems that I had with the film, was the fact that the Russians managed to kill everyone in the Overwatch team, except for the actual person who killed the ladies son, which must have been a coincidence. Maybe they left it open for a sequel. I must admit, I did think that Li Noor was the innocent party and that he was targeted by baddies, who went through hell to try and capture him, so the writers did a good job by misleading the audience until the very end. I was also impressed with the cinematography, and the believable shoot-outs, which had a touch of Heat, in terms of the sound and artillery. Once the action hits the apartment building, I liked the tribute to the Raid, which was the same in many ways, but nothing will touch the original. Although I have highly praised this film, it still felt like a Mish-Mash of other movies, hence the mediocre rating. I can't help feeling that it would have been more of a raw film without Wahlberg's name tied to it, which would have been better in many ways, but it wouldn't have been distributed as well. Anyway, I personally think that it deserved a bigger profit at the box office, mainly for the effort to make it unique, and the brilliant casting of Iko, who actually made Wahlberg look like an amateur when it came to the action scenes. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Peter Berg, who also brought you Very Bad Things in 1998, Welcome to the Jungle, Friday Night Lights, The Kingdom, Hancock, Battleship, Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day. His next project sees him pairing up with Wahlberg again in Wonderland, which is about an ex-felon named Spenser, who returns to Boston's criminal underworld to unravel a twisted murder conspiracy, which is due out this year. They did announce that Mile 22 is going to be a trilogy, at the 2017 CinemaCon, but there isn't a script in development yet. As it didn't smash the box office, there isn't a high demand for a sequel, but I personally think that it would compliment this movie if they brought out a sequel sooner, while the plot if fresh in people's mind. With films like Six Billion Dollar Man, Home Invasion, Wonderland, Good Joe Bell and Scoob, which is a feature-length animated Scooby Doo movie, Mark Wahlberg hasn't really got time to fit in a sequel any time soon, which is a shame because it's a promising concept.Budget: $50million

35,Fella_shibby,Uwais' action sequences are the highlight of this film. Watch out for his handcuffed fight choreography. Wahlberg's plaid shirts were cool.,8,31 October 2018,"In the beginning we are introduced to a team of CIA operatives, Wahlberg, Rousey, the attractive Lauren Cohan, etc, all working for Overwatch, a secretive agency which is supervised by Malkovich. A lil similar to Russell Crowe from Body of Lies.
The team infiltrates a safehouse n kills Russian agents including a young boy.
Forward 16 months n the team is in Indonesia trying to locate WMD.
A local rogue agent walks into the embassy n hands over the disk containing the information about the WMD.
He insists on giving the password only if he is given asylum in the U.S.
The team is assigned a task to take that rogue Indonesian agent (Uwais) to an airplane at an airstrip 22 miles away from the embassy. Lil similar to 16 Blocks.
Uwais' name has become synonym with fast paced, brutal, hand to hand combat.
In fact, Uwais' action sequences are the highlight of this film.
The film moves at a steady pace, has enough thrill n action to keep viewers glued. Wahlberg is getting monotonous with his sniper gun act but nonetheless he did ok. His plaid shirts were cool.
Malcovich was looking tired n it looked like he did this role to pay his bills. No wonder his weird hairstyle in this film.
The twist was predictable for me. Lil similar to The Jackal, Usual Suspects, Basic, etc.",Mile 22

37,jtindahouse,A highly enjoyable film,8,26 October 2018,"When I watched 'Mile 22' I was unaware that it had been pre-planned as a trilogy. Had I known this going in I think I would've viewed the movie in a very different light. When the movie ended I asked myself what the hell just happened? Shouldn't this be the mid-way point in the film, not the end? People unaware of that fact are going to be left a little perplexed I feel.The movie actually worked very well for my liking. I liked the characters, and in particular Mark Wahlberg's character. I understand that he won't be to everyones liking, but for me a very dark lead character in a movie can be a great thing. For one thing it is a lot more realistic and secondly it makes everything nice they do and say worth so much more. It adds so many layers to the character.There were some great action sequences, a twist I never saw coming and some clever, engaging dialogue. All up I had a really fun time with 'Mile 22' and I look forward to the next two instalments in the series.",Mile 22
38,stevendbeard,Adrenaline Fused Action Movie,8,18 August 2018,"I saw ""Mile 22"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Deepwater Horizon, The Other Guys; Lauren Cohan-Maggie on The Walking Dead_tv, The Vampire Diaries_tv; Ronda Rousey-Furious 7, The Expendables 3; Iko Uwais-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, the Raid movies and John Malkovich-Deepwater Horizon, Warm Bodies.
This is an adrenaline fused action movie directed by Peter Berg, who did Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day just to name a few. Mark plays the squad leader of Overwatch, a branch of the C.I.A. that handles jobs no one else wants. Lauren and Ronda are two of his seven member team and just a heads up, Ronda has some gun battles but don't look for her doing much hand to hand fighting-they saved those for Iko. John is Mark's boss, who watches all the action on computer screens while Marky Mark and his funky bunch kicks ass. After a mission goes wrong, Iko-an informant to Lauren in Bogota, Columbia-comes forward seeking asylum and a free trip to America. He says he knows about some deadly bombs in certain sensitive locations and he will hand over the locations upon his exit from the country. From the American embassy to the airport is 22 miles-that is where they got the movie title-and it is a harrowing gauntlet that Clint Eastwood would have trouble with. There are all sorts of people trying to stop them, from Colombian Police to Russian spies. Lots of gun battles, car chases, motor cycle chases and martial arts fights-I did mention that Iko was in the Raid movies, remember? The movie was filmed in Bogota, Colombia and Atlanta, Georgia and Peter Berg said that he plans on this being the first in a trilogy. I guess that my only complaint was in the way it ended-but since there will probably be sequels, it explains some things.
It's rated ""R"" for strong violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I really enjoyed this one-except for the ending-and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Mile 22

However, the film suffers from both being extremely unlikely and hampered by featuring yet another high IQ agent that can't follow the rules as played by Wahlberg who speaks interminable rubbish at great speed throughout. He is an unlikely leader and frankly deeply irritating throughout which rather spoiled it for me.

Lauren Cohan and Ronda Rousey are fine, whereas John Malkovich's role lacks any interest. Iko Uwais is probably this film's best performer.As I've already mentioned, when the plot is eventually explained and shown to us I actually appreciated the idea.

44,kluseba,Coitus interruptus,6,11 September 2018,"Be warned that if you watch this movie, you won't get a proper conclusion. The film doesn't have a true climax and ends on several cliffhangers. A sequel has already been announced as well as a spin-off web series. If you want to watch a movie with a coherent exposition, intense rising action, concise climax, gripping falling action and satisfactory resolution, you shouldn't watch this movie at all. I actually felt cheated watching this film because Mile 22 is rather like a television pilot than a genuine standalone movie.That isn't the only thing that is wrong with this flick. Mile 22 actually has a decent plot and a little twist but instead of developing this potential, the writers threw everything overboard. The twist is revealed very early in the movie, hence depriving the film from a real climax. In addition to this, the film chaotically meanders from scenes in the present to scenes in the past which is particularly confusing in the first few minutes. The perspectives also change as we follow friends and foes alike without any coherence. The shaky cameras make this film even harder to digest. The structure of this movie is also quite strange, since the first half focuses on a massive number of dialogues with the exception of the intriguing opening ten minutes while the second half offers non-stop action sequences. The plot is basically quite simple but is told so chaotically that it ironically fits the movie: American intelligence officers need to escort a potential double agent with important information to an airport in Indonesia but local law enforcers as well as Russian terrorists are trying to prevent this by any means necessary. The whole film feels disjointed, messy and unfocused.One thing that saves this movie from being below average are the great action scenes in the second half. Iko Uwais' skills alone are worth watching the film alone as he uses feet, hands and even his head to fight relentlessly while also using authentic weapons as well as improvised weapons such as chairs, tables and windows. Mark Wahlberg also plays some tough action scenes, handling his weapons fearlessly and skillfully to find a way out of the most challenging situations. His female sidekick played by Lauren Cohan has to fight for her life several times and performs her role with energetic despair. Among wolves in wolves' clothing, she is the character viewers might sympathize with most.Another positive element are the characters that have some depth even though this movie only scratches on the surface of this potential. Mark Wahlberg plays a grumpy sociopath who constantly plays with fire. Lauren Cohan incarnates a divorced mother with anger management issues. Iko Uwais convinces in the role of a sinister, quiet and intelligent agent who has numerous hidden agendas. The side characters remain more superficial but interesting nonetheless for an action movie, especially since there are some intriguing cameos by well-known household names of the genre.The movie feels aborted when the credits start rolling after less than ninety minutes. Several questions remain unanswered. The film doesn't offer a proper resolution to the events that were meticulously prepared over the course of about eighty-five minutes. You will leave the cinema scratching your head and wondering whether you have just experienced ninety minutes that were wasted or well-spent. Mile 22 is an entertaining film and especially the second half will please to those who like films in the key of The Raid or The Villainess. On the other side, it's a chaotic, inconclusive and simply stated unfinished mess of a movie. If you care for a story, I would suggest you to avoid this movie altogether. If you just want to see Iko Uwais, Mark Wahlberg, Lauren Cohan and their sidekicks kicking ass for about forty-five minutes, go ahead and enjoy yourself.",Mile 22

Mile 22 contains may of the SpyFi tropes: Mother's team take over CCTV systems, traffic lights, power systems, provide eyes from above through drones and of course missiles from above. The heart beat, blood pressure and oxygen levels of each Overwatch field operative is monitored in real time. The film opens with the team taking out a Russian Intelligence safehouse in the US. A mission which swiftly moves from capture to kill as resistance is encountered. Overwatch is totally ruthless and kills unarmed, wounded prisoners. 16 months later Overwatch are in a South-East Asian capital, Wahlberg's colleague Lauren Cohen is running an agent, Iko Uwais, within the local police Special Forces, information he supplies regarding the transport of stolen Caesium is inaccurate but he comes to the US embassy seeking sanctuary.

A mysterious Russian Spy-plane assists in the attack on overwatch. The choreography of the fight scenes is stunning. Gun battles, hand to hand knife and martial arts clashes and a sequence of running battles through an apartment complex which is reminiscent of The Raid. No quarter is given as the casualties mount. Car and motorbike chases par excellence also take place.This espionage thriller directed by Peter Berg and written by Lea Carpenter is far better than many reviews would suggest.

What is essentially a heist picture but w/a person being the goal instead of cash in a bank (in this case Iko Uwais being ferried from the US Embassy in Indonesia to an airport by a group of CIA operatives) brings home the action but when it comes to character motivation & execution, it falls flat. When Wahlberg's leader opens his mouth to berate another team member or remind the audience of the dangers of a chemical weapons attack, my eyes tended to roll back into their sockets & wish the film would get along its merry way.

The rest go in, there are 6 or so hostiles. Although later on they discover a final one, a young kid. During the raid they capture a bunch of disk drives hidden in a safe. Things get complicated though because the bad guys do get their hands on weapons and also have rigged the house to go up in flames. So the mission wasn't exactly a success. It was about getting ahold of cesium.Later we meet Wahlberg working at the US embassy in Indonesia. Something isn't right with him. During the intro credits we learn that his brain works faster than everyone else's. He seems to be emotionally disabled and as a result bullies everyone around him. Except that Wahlberg doesn't make for a convincing bully screaming at everyone. It's all about work all the time for him and he has some compulsion about yanking a rubber band on his wrist. On his team is the lovely Lauren Cohan who is going through a divorce or some such thing. We don't lean anything else about the rest of the team. At some point some Indonesian cop gives himself up in front of the embassy. He holds a drive in his hand. On it is information about the missing cesium. But it is heavily encrypted. He offers the password in exchange for a life in the US but the drive is also self-destructing. Turns out this guy was the source of the info for the botched intro mission. Still the US agrees even though Indonesian authorities are already at the embassy asking for their guy back. After bad guys infiltrate the embassy and attack the cop, the race is on to get him to a safe place and our team is put into action. They have to transport him 22 miles to the airport. But the bad guys are more than ready to take them on, on the streets and in an apartment complex. Good thing the cop is also a bad-ass martial artist.There's something else going on. The Russians are tracking all this and have plans of their own in regards to all this and there are a couple of surprises.The story of Mile 22 is excellent. You want to like Wahlberg but his character makes it hard. An action hero who is also a total jerk--that doesn't work too well. Dialogue is often unclear. There's a lot of good action especially Iko Uwais's martial arts, but direction and editing somehow can't make the best of it. Fast-paced action is poorly filmed-edited. A shame really because this could easily have been an outstanding action thriller. Despite the weaknesses, I found Mile 22 entertaining thanks to its great story.",Mile 22

Its a film that brings initial intense excitement but ultimately, leaves the viewer feeling mentally exhausted.The problem is the action overdose in Mile 22 fails to break up the gun toting mayhem with enough breathers or alternately variety, to let the audience really appreciate the gun play that's on offer.Its a shame too as I did like aspects of this film. Its story narrowly misses being yet more anti Russian propaganda. That said, its an interesting tale with an end that some may not like but its refreshing to see things play out in a way that's not predictable.Suffice to say sometimes less is more......

And that's the problem. Mile 22 isn't an awful movie but it just feels so redundant and overdone. We've seen all of this before and it's just not interesting enough anymore. The impression of this movie fades away before the popcorn even goes stale and that's just disappointing.Overall, I think this is a solid background movie.

There's plenty of bang for your buck, just don't expect anything compelling as far as plot goes. The film itself is just over an hour and a half, and I would bet forty-five minutes of that runtime is action (the other forty-five is awkward dialog and psychobabble). Whenever Mark and his crew shut up and shoot people, the movie is adequate, but whenever it tries to give us a moral dilemma it fails spectacularly. This movie can't ask questions about the morality of killing people if it also has a character that repeatedly and gleefully begs his boss to let him use a drone to kill people. What kind of tone are you trying to set? Is this a movie that wants you to realize war is hell, like ""Hurt Locker"" (2009)? Or is it a movie that wants you to cheer when someone's face gets blown off like in ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985)? I'm not sure.",Mile 22

Ir'a wild ride of cat and mouse violence in rapid succession. The ""package"" plays his role extremely well to which Wahlberg is rightly in rage over as he attempts to deliver ""the goods"". Nothing too original but it does create a vaguely possible new cold war methodology enough to hang the story on. Not a 8-star film as it simply doesn't aspire for epic ness. It does hit a fantastic action sweet spot more than once or twice though. The interest of the viewer is held quite well and the ending doesn't crap out as it fits a path already plowed.

55,rgkarim,Going the Distance On Action!,7,18 August 2018,"Action movies to many seem like a dime a dozen, but adrenaline fans like me always look for the thrills to come in any form. Tonight, I finish my week of reviews with another slam-bang, explosion riddled feature that hopes to excite the audience that plans to go see it. Yes, tonight the poorly advertised Mile 22 is in theaters and with it the hopes that Mark Wahlberg can bring another gun heavy movie some positive energy and laughs. What's in store? Robbie K is here to help you out with another movie review. Let's get started: Movie: Mile 22 (2018)Director:
 Peter Berg
Writers:
 Lea Carpenter (screenplay by), Graham Roland (story by) 
Stars:
 Mark Wahlberg, Lauren Cohan, Iko Uwais
LIKES: The Pace: It's brisk, it's fast, and it is perfect for an action film. Mile 22 has few breaks once the excitement goes, with the last 35-40 minutes being nothing but high intensity violence and mayhem. True, there is a middle part meant to build the suspense and lay the story, but this slow part soon ends, and leaves you ready to take on the special effects fest. The Use of Characters: This movie has a lot of characters, and therefore a lot of responsibility to utilize them. Mile 22 succeeds in bringing all the team together to try and accomplish the goal. Whether it is the support team, the villains, or the ground team, almost everyone introduced has a significant role to play and gets there moments to shine. Certainly, some more than others, but Mile 22 accomplished the integration mission. Make-Up: Minor like, but I give props to the group involved with the transformation of the agents from pristine elite to looking as if they have gone through hell and back. The artificial blood, the contusions and abrasions, even the various bullet wounds are all nicely crafted to looking realistic and bringing the edge to the movie. Mark Wahlberg's character... sometimes: The lead of the team holds a lot on his shoulders, but one thing that his character brought was the comedy and action point of the film. His character has some issues that he lives with, allowing him to talk at a thousand miles an hour and being funny at the same time. It's the same type of Wahlberg character, just a little more amped and over the top, sometimes to the point of annoyance, but then he redeems himself and somehow comes through. Action: The battles in this movie are semi-carbon copy sequences of what feels like a video game from Tom Clancy's work. Yet, despite the similarities, these fights are still dynamic enough to feel different and blend together to unleash an exciting sequence. Gun battles are strategic and suspenseful, supported by plenty of pyrotechnics to help shake things up with a nice light show. When close combat evolves, it's modern meeting traditional martial arts moves, including using grandiose kill moves using out of the ordinary tools. Things mix together well, and really go out in the exciting climax you wanted. DISLIKES: The Violence: A minor dislike and more of a warning, Mile 22 is not for the faint of heart or the sensitive. It's action is certainly fast paced, but the film has plenty of detailed shots involving graphic finishes and bloody blasts. Like an episode of the Walking Dead, a few characters have close ups of some projectile or tool going through their body, and sometimes a little drawn out. Therefore, seriously consider taking little ones or those who don't stomach things well to this film. The Lackluster Story/Character Development: They tried, really they did, but Mile 22's characters are superficial, puddle deep, in regards to details. Some hasty character introductions, a few lines of dialogue to talk interests, and a hasty montage are the extent of most characters inner workings. As such, you're not really connected to the characters outside of their other works and celebrity status. Even the story itself has needed work, for its presented in a very ambiguous manner that seems like a mad chess game with deadly tools of destruction. Given some action films forgo a story, Mile 22 really needed some plot development to actually care about the characters. The Twist: It was a surprise, it integrated what seemed random moments, but I was not a fan of the ending. One part is because this ending felt out of place with the majority of the film, the left-wing tangent just didn't do it for me. In addition, the ending was just very truncated, abruptly dropped out in five minutes and left on a very open terms. If you like that kind of surprise, yay, but perhaps some closure was needed to end it in the right place for me. The Camera Work: Action movie can be tough to film, but why in the world do some people struggle with camera work in this genre. Much of it works for me, but the close-up fights are a mad array of camera changes, trying to get all the angles of the fight. While it added some edge to the film, the chaotic camera actually robbed the detail and at times were useless images that only alliterated to the moves being executed. Fortunately, these moments are few, but the close combat fight could have been even better if they had worked on camera dynamics. The VERDICT: Mile 22 delivers on the action, not shying around the destruction and violence to really bring the adrenaline thrilled themes it promised. It's ending is the highlight of the film, and it has all the bells and whistles to support the grand design of destruction. Yet, the movie really wont' strike well with many looking for more past the action craze that it brings and doesn't dive far into the qualities some people relish in story and characters. In addition, some of the camera choice may not work for you given the unstable camera work. Overall though, worth the trip to the theater because of the special effects focus, otherwise holdout until it hits homes. My scores: Action/Thriller: 7.0-7.5Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5",Mile 22
56,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Mile 22,6,23 August 2018,"A band of CIA operatives have to travel 22 miles through Southeast Asia. They must transport a foreign intelligence asset for extraction. Along the way, terrorists and street hoodlums are out to kill the chipper operatives and reclaim said asset. That's the blueprint of Mile 22, a mini Black Hawk Down that feels like one long, slack 95-minute action sequence (that happens to be ""22's"" subsequent running time). In truth, ""22"" is so hyper-kinetic and so all over the place, it comes off as the movie equivalent of a 10-year-old boy who forgot to take his Ritalin. Non-sympathetic, vacant, and morbidly violent are other words I would use to describe Mile 22.So yeah, ""22"" on paper seems like the perfect vehicle for its star, Mark Wahlberg. In true obligatory fashion, Marky Mark spits out insulting and hard-hearted dialogue like a hyena on angel dust. Saddled with a clunky script by rookie Lea Carpenter, Wahlberg does have some lines that relegate a sort of badass detection. However, most of what he says feels like gargled, espionage gibberish. And oh yeah, don't get me started on his character constantly snapping a rubbing band around his wrist. That's just one of the quirks that makes Mark's James Silva so quote unquote, ""mentally unstable"". Anyway, Mile 22 has plenty of nasty fistfights, ""Hand of God"" explosions, sundry fast cuts, hi-tech sutures, and deafening shootouts (if you can see what's visibly going on). They keep the flick from being anything but boring and void of energy. Also, I sort of dug ""22's"" gotcha ending which is kinda reminiscent of The Usual Suspects and 2003's Basic. Still, Mile 22 projects like a rushed and swiftly pasted effort from its otherwise calculated and nuanced director, Peter Berg. Bottom line: Berg and Wahlberg make Mile 22 a grandstanding and strutting affair. Nonetheless, they got much better ""mileage"" when they tackled the subject of the Boston Marathon bombing via Patriot's Day (from a couple of years ago). Knowing that Peter Berg will bounce back with more heroic, true story fodder in the near future, I'm gonna go with a two and a half star rating here.",Mile 22
57,Kingslaay,Not too bad and passable,7,1 September 2018,"Mile 22 contains a lot of action and actually had a decent plot. The overall story in the end was actually quite intriguing when revealed. If this film was rewritten, had a better director, pacing and more character development it would have been really good. It tries to pack in too much action and rushes through the plot. Overall an alright time at the movies but it could have been more.",Mile 22
58,Kingslaay,Not too bad,7,16 September 2018,"Mile 22 was full of action, fast pace and if you like that you're in for a treat. The plot was actually kind of decent and had a twist. If it had been rewritten, had a different director and better character development this film could have been excellent. The main motive could have been deepened and expanded on further building up the climax. Imagine what a Christopher Nolan lens could have done to it if used. It ended up being average-ish and had too much action in almost every scene. Overall not all that bad. 7/10",Mile 22

It looked like a remake of THE RAID in places and even has the main character from that movie. I presume it was produced in Asia as this is what they dig, no story just lots of action and violence. THE RAID was a great movie but this just doesn't come close!And the overuse of the MF phrase - I am not a prude but what is it with movies now that profuse swearing is considered the norm?It makes me cringe the amount that was used in this film and it is really quite sad; in my parents time swearing was seen as a lack of intelligence and lack of vocabulary but it seems its the accepted norm these days - no wonder society is going downhill.

62,Terryfan,Nothing but a mission impossible wannabe,2,19 August 2018,"Seeing the trailer for Mile 22 looks promising and you might have been rewarding for seeing the movie. I am sorry but all I got was just a disappointment another example of why movie trailers should be called false Advertisement. I saw the movie last night and it just made me wish I had saw something elseMile 22 is one of the biggest letdowns of the year and by far one of the worst movies of the year that I have seen. This movie is not even worth a rental I have seen some bad movies but this ranks among the worst. It almost feels like you can write a book
About the wrongs of this movieThe acting in the movie is very forced it just felt like they were not even trying so it's very awful and it's hard to believe in the characters when the cast is not putting effort into themThe story is very off the wall and it felt like the writer shouldn't give up their day job it just will let you be in a land of confusion Mile 22 is a failure nothing but a mission impossible wannabe and it shows why it is hard to go to the movies sometimes I give Mile 22 a 2 out of 10",Mile 22
63,martimusross,Don't Go It Was Awful.........Disaster!,1,11 September 2018,"Since the Killing we seem to populate every crime drama with a protagonist who is high functioning autistic and sociopath despite the reality that these individuals would never be selected by SAS or FBI SWAT team. The movie made me nauseous as the editing flicked from face to face and scene to scene several times a second like a strobe light. Quite frankly I would myself have ended every character in the movie with a bread knife to end the movie, they were all vile throughout. The violence was gratuitous, it was sexist and stereotypical, the script was banal, the acting shallow. This movie was an abject disaster and should never has been made and I would suggest both the director and producer should be subjected to the same bread knife.",Mile 22
64,MR_Heraclius,Good action!!,6,22 February 2020,"Mile 22 has a simple goal in its script, maybe too simple, get this man from point A to point B. The script itself has a great twist at the end, but for the rest of the movie it's lazy. We get to know everything about Mark Wahlberg's characters through 2 minutes of exposition, which is Michael Bay-type lazy. And for the rest of the movie he doesn't really change, nor do any of the other characters. The action is entertaining, but it is shaky and quickly cut together, and not like Paul Greengrass, more like Columbiana. I thought Hollywood was done with this trope of cutting quickly to hide the action, John Wick and Atomic Blonde showed us that. But this movie does it again. Overall, the movie is just meh, not great, not the worst, just meh. And I expected better from Peter Berg.",Mile 22
65,leftbanker-1,Completely Awful on Multiple Levels,1,23 October 2018,"Violated my rule of never more than one explosion in the trailer. This one had at least eight explosions and Marky Mark saying ""Kaboom"" which counts for at least four explosions. So, right out of the gate this thing had ""garbage"" written all over it.""We are the third option."" Stupidity should never be an option. The fourth option is to watch any other movie available, or God forbid, read a book. If that isn't possible, watch Frozen again with your kids.Such a crackerjack crew and they leave their prisoners unsecured and unwatched while they check out a boogie man on the second floor? A million things could have gone wrong in this situation so why do they make that ""thing"" a huge and unforgivable error on the part of the operatives? That is some lazy writing, and it only took eight minutes on film.I would say that in the first scene this elite squad failed miserably...and it was really stupid. The hose blows to smithereens and the crew marches out of the neighborhood in broad daylight in full battle dress. That's what I call subtle. Just because you want to have an ""action"" scene doesn't mean that it can be completely devoid of common sense.And then Mark Wahlberg ""acting"" and you always have to put acting in quotation marks when the same sentence contains ""Mark Wahlberg."" He reads, probably from an off-screen teleprompter. He has the talent of a North Dakota Action News reporter, no offense to that group.And thwapping a rubber band on his wrist is about all the character development we get out of the guy.Guy holds up a sign to the video camera, ""You're wasting time."" Yes, they are.And an operative's divorce somehow means something to me? It doesn't. It's annoying.Oh my God, the fight scene in the med lab was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. It went on forever. If the guy is worth his salt as a fighter it would have been over in 20 seconds.So let me repeat: that was a moronic fight scene.Mark Wahlberg spewing nonsensical, poorly-written dialogue across a desk every few minutes was not something that I would put in the plus column of the movie.The shootout with the motorcycle crew had no perspective and was completely devoid of tension. I couldn't see who was shooting at whom.I really, really wish they would stop calling him ""The Package."" His manhood is not really visible.They leave one of their own behind to be a suicide bomber. Great, now we are just like them! How could this movie get stupider? Spoiler! It always get stupider.All of the movie's super high-tech spy stupidity is available to the average slob via Google Maps.

67,IonicBreezeMachine,"It's a solid technical exercise, but its convoluted narrative and shallow characters make it a hollow experience.",5,7 November 2020,"James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) leads a clandestine CIA strike team codenamed Overwatch. While on assignment in the southeast Asian nation of Indocarr, local police officer Li Noor (Iko Uwais) approaches the Americans with time sensitive intelligence on the location of weapons grade Cesium which he'll deliver on condition of his extraction to the United States. This leads to Silva and his team escorting Li Noor through hostile territory 22 miles to extraction.Mile 22 is the fourth collaboration between Mark Wahlberg and director Peter Berg following their work on Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. With those three previous collaborations, Berg and Wahlberg have shown themselves to be an effective team when it comes to bringing grit and intensity to true life stories. Mile 22 is a different approach for the duo as not only is this a fictional narrative, but also the intended launch point of a trilogy and expanded media franchise for company STX entertainment. Unfortunately while the technical aspects of the movie are decent enough, the narrative and characters make it a chore.James Silva despite being the main character (kind of) is off to the sidelines for most of the movie and is also unlikable due to having an underlying personality disorder that is never fully discussed or explored. In many ways it feels like the filmmakers were trying to do something similar to Carrie Mathison from the TV show homeland, but the movie is so relentlessly fast paced it never gives any meaningful development. At least Silva leaves some level of impact, the rest of the Overewatch team feel either interchangeable or as with John Malkovich (who's scenes all take place within ONE room over the course of the movie) are coasting on their established charisma. Iko Uwais as Li Noor manages to make a decent impression in the film and shows himself more than capable of being in a movie like this, but is rather underutilized and doesn't get to do much until the 40 minute mark.Structurally the movie is a mess. The opening action sequence is incredibly divorced from what proceeds it and when we do go through the story it's sloppily intercut with a debriefing segment and even when the movie does focus on its story it really doesn't get moving until the movie is almost half over. The movie is only about 85 minutes long not including credits so its a quick sit, and there are some really good action sequences and cinematography, but the characters are so flat and uninteresting that there are two ""noble sacrifice"" moments in the film that ring hollow.Mile 22 is a middle of the road action thriller that makes itself watchable due to Peter Berg's solid direction. While the action beats are decently handled the movie's characters are lacking in charisma or impact that make the whole affair feel hollow and pointless.",Mile 22
68,saptesh786,Raid and Shooter! new version,7,14 November 2018,"Mile 22 is just seen for the name of Iko Uwais ( the Raid 1 & 2 )and Mark Wahlberg ( Shooter). As me movie is desirable rating of 7 or 8 but it has only 6.1 and many negative reviews. There is a trend now a days on IMDB that viewers rating good movies low ranking and average or wasted movies get high raking. Meaning if you find high raking movie that definitely will be poor and vice-versa low raking should be a good one.
Due to planning trilogy the story is not presenting very clearly in first part. This makes viewers to less connect with the movie. Iko's role is mysterious and only open at the end. Mark is as usual as macho gunner man (like 'Shooter') with a crazy touch in his role, but we did not see his any remarkable incident that proves he is a different guy whose mind run faster than other. Cohan has believable role of divorcee cop and very hard to meet her girl. Technology is playing a significant role here as many si fi movies.
The best part of the movie is car journey to flight. It is full of thriller. In my view there are some fusions this section rather we called some mistakes from director, but in a speedy flow of action those confusions are gone looks missing and one cannot able to notice.
I recommended to watch this thriller and I gave 7 stars.",Mile 22

I watched her in ""Entourage "" like three years ago she was ""Ronda"" but if considering this her debut, she was good evnthough i wished they let her punch someone or fight for a bit but oh well ... also the Indonesian actor Iko Uwais was wow ,, and the fighting scenes were perfect.Final thought,, there are some bad reviews ,, no idea why !! maybe they hate Russia that much or they hate Wahlberg ,, i don't know .. the movie was okay and the ending was shocking in a way ,, so it is recommended , go watch it.",Mile 22

73,spookyrat1,Crosstown Traffic!,9,6 February 2019,"Mile 22 is an explosively good action movie with a compelling storyline featuring a very neat twist towards the end, that I have to confess completely blind-sided me. I'm a little bewildered by the rather large number of critics, who said the narrative was too confusing. I think it was pretty straight forward keeping in mind that as is becoming more common practice, there are some flash forwards and it isn't really spoiling to add that the prologue has a direct involvement with the main story thread. I was happy with the way the story ended albeit, a little ambiguously, as apparently this was intended to be the first of a trilogy of films featuring Mark Wahlberg's character James Silva.Wahlberg's character also seems to have been misunderstood by many film goers. It's clear right from the opening credits (follow them closely), that he is a talented agent and team leader, but also burdened with a number of mental issues, which are distracting, especially to others around him, but don't inhibit him from doing his job. Some might describe him as having a gifted mind locked in overdrive 24/7.A mega-bonus for Mile 22 was the inclusion of Iko Uwais, whose enigmatic character Li Noor was the cream on the cake, as far as action is concerned. His silat inspired fight scenes are fast paced and electric-and easily the highlight of the movie in my view. Uwais, along with Ronda Rousey, playing a Silva underling, both demonstrate they have developing acting chops, beyond those chops witnessed and used in various martial arts arenas.Peter Berg definitely seems to be an acquired taste. Some see him as being a slightly more thinking person's Michael Bay. I like most of his films, though couldn't much see the point of Deepwater Horizon. Mile 22 in my opinion is one of his best. Apparently there is still a reasonable chance of a sequel going ahead, despite this film being a relative critical and commercial failure. I for one welcome the chance of an extension to the story.",Mile 22

This one did - even though much of the time I had no idea exactly what was happening. By the end I certainly had no clear idea of what had happened to whom, etc. But the action and stunts have a high degree of artistry, and I could appreciate that.This is no Jason Bourne movie.

Wahlberg's character is rather unlikeable and all the others have almost no development. I fail to see why Ronda Rousey was cast in this movie and then not even given a single fight scene. There's a pretty terrible advertisement for a divorce app, the quick cuts in most of the action scenes are very annoying, and the ending doesn't have its intended effect. Iko Uwais was a big standout though with some great fighting skills. Mile 22 isn't completely devoid of thrills, but it doesn't have enough to make up for all of its flaws.",Mile 22

80,Beejerman,JEER - (4 stars out of 10),4,4 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...This film focuses in on a covert team called Overwatch, tasked with the extraction of a ""package"" who contains the code to a disk that is on a timer for destruction containing life saving information. The agent they are transporting agrees to provide them with the needed code as long as he can be extracted to the U.S. So, with an armed team (headed by James Silva played by Mark Wahlberg) in full force, they begin their hazardous 22 mile journey to the airport site. First, why they didn't just airlift him via chopper to the site instead of land rovers is beyond me, but I digress. This movie plays out in a way similar to the film, 16 Blocks with Bruce Willis - though I personally felt that movie was much better than this one.The first half of the movie, about 45 minutes worth, really tests your patience as you are subjected to a lot of shouting, personality conflicts and family problems. For a character who is supposed to be more intelligent than his peers, Silva never shuts up, instead feeling it important to impose his will on everyone around him making him the most unpleasant person in the room pretty much at all times.Then the real fun kicks in during the 2nd half of the film with the actual extraction and all the obstacles they face along the way. If you like your movies loud and violent, this is the movie for you - trust me. The highlight of this movie for me was the fight scenes involving Iko Uwais (playing the part of the agent they are extracting) as he survives multiple assassination attempts. Unfortunately, even this isn't enough to salvage this chaotic and convoluted action mess. They even throw a nice surprise twist at you in the end, but by then, you won't really care anymore - just thankful that it is finally over and you can move on to the next film. Not one I would recommend by any means.",Mile 22

Mark Wahlberg is the main star in this film and his portrayal is so good it reminded me of his character from ""The Departed"". The main part of the film that made me scratch my head but at the same time chocked was the ending, with a big twist that made the ""good guys"" hopeless from what came at them. I was watching the scene a felt very confused but surprised from what I saw, like a brilliant move in chess. The ending left a thousand opportunities for a sequel and I'm positive about it.

92,ethanbresnett,Slow to get going but fun enough once we get there,6,22 March 2020,"I found Mile 22 to be a bit of a slow burner considering what it is. The film takes a good half hour/40 minutes to get going which, considering its a 90 minute movie is a bit unforgivable. It feels like a bit of a blend between Shooter, Lone Survivor and a few other Wahlberg films - a lot of it will feel familiar to those well versed in his films.Thankfully once it does get going the action is pretty relentless and entertaining. The martial arts scenes provided by Iko Uwais are as expected - brutal and intricately choreographed, delivering the finest action of the movie. Unfortunately a lot of the other action is quite derivative of the genre and nothing special, but that doesn't stop it being fun. One major criticism I would have is that there are far too many cuts for my liking, particularly in the gun fights.The plot was a bit so so, it wasn't overly engaging which is why the first half of the movie dragged somewhat. Some of this was down to the characters and some down to the script - neither of which were great. Mark Wahlberg was Mark Wahlberg in Mile 22, as he is with most performances. His character was quite annoying though, and if you are looking for character development you won't get it here. The best we got was some opening credits exposition (which I dislike at the best of times) on Wahlberg's character, none of which really had any import on the story.At times Mile 22 tries to masquerade as something more intelligent but ultimately its a popcorn movie. You'll probably be entertained watching it though - its a Mark Wahlberg movie after all, they can't go too far wrong.",Mile 22
93,nikola17,Movie I Have Always Been Waiting for it's So Highly Recommend.,10,4 September 2018,"I Recommend it but I Highly Recommend this movie for everyone it's worth for your money and ticket and time it's WORTH IT. Jeez I Was So Glad Peter Berg Made and Directed This Movie Made It to Live Well Done I Been Waiting for this for 3 years ago In June 2015 there were plans for this movie Mark Wahlberg, Ronda Rousey, Iko Uwais I was WOW I am big fan of all 3 guys I am really With Director I loved he made so many good movies I enjoyed The Rundown aka Welcome to the Jungle (2003) with Dwayne ROCK Johnson, Sean William Scott, I have always loved that movie so much so good, The Kingdom (2007) with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner film witch was ok never was fan of it, then Hancock (2008) Superhero Will Smith movie that is nothing based on Comic Book stand alone Superhero movie he did witch was good and fun but never was Die Hard fan of it, they were going to make a sequel of it but never happened it will happen who knows I could be wrong. Then Battleship (2012) movie that is based on board game a lot people liked it because 34% Rotten Tomatoes, marketing isn't bad but movie got 5.9 IMDB but Mile 22 is 39% beats the crap of Battleship, never was fan of Battleship. Later on Peter Berg made true story movies like Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, movie his made last before Mile 22 Patriots Day. Peter Berg Is Really good at making true story movies he is very creative at it I loved how he makes them, I thought those movies he worked with Wahlberg in past was great I Can see Peter loves working with Mark Wahlberg all time. Mile 22 Is Not True Story film but its great movie even it's not true story. I thought this has a lot of Unforgettable Performance with Mark Wahlberg you can never forget about his Character great character he is like smart guy with a lot of Attitude fully loaded with Bad Attitude makes me laugh it's hard to say what kinda Personality he is but he is an abrasive, unapologetic guy. When you watch it you will know Mark Playing the unabashedly unsavory hero James Silva, Wahlberg gives a high-wired performance that never runs out of gas. If you like you're Wahlberg fast and loud, Mile 22 has the performance for you. The action oh yeah well shot, well made, it's fun you will never blink, you will never shut your eyes or fall sleep you will watch the movie so full on to know what the heck is going to happen next way. I thought another cast is great like Lauren Cohan, Death Race 2, Walking Dead, Reach Me, The Boy, Martha Wayne Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice but in a Uncredited cameo. John Malkovich is a pretty good he is not involved in action but he is good in movie I enjoyed him in Con Air, Red, Red 2 many of his another movies I Thought he did fine he worked with Mark Wahlberg with him in Deepwater Horizon with Peter Berg now with this again his second time great no problem with him in it the cast is no problem I enjoyed everyone in film. I thought it was great to have Iko Uwais in this movie he appears in 3rd act in movie he has a lot to do in this movie like he has character he is not wasted he is has a lot and a lot of talent in movie and his martial arts his martial arts he does a lot of it involved in this movie. He is not cameo or some random person you will see for minute or two no he is in movie a lot. Story follows It follows an elite CIA task force James Silva / ""child 1 (Mark Wahlberg), (Lauren Cohan) Alice Kerr / ""child 2, Sam Snow / ""child 3 (Ronda Rousey)
Douglas / ""child 4 (Carlo Alban) are teams together you have awesome raid opening scene at house when strike team code-named Overwatch to infiltrate a Russian FSB safe house in the United States. Under the supervision of James Bishop, Overwatch's mission is to locate and destroy shipments of cesium some kinda strike team code-named Overwatch to infiltrate a Russian FSB safe house in the United States. Under the supervision of James Bishop, Overwatch's mission is to locate and destroy shipments of cesium before the highly toxic substance strike team code-named Overwatch to infiltrate a Russian FSB safe house in the. Before the highly toxic substance can be weaponized to kill thousands. I thought the thing is I am glad I saw Ronda Rousey Act she is in movie lot but ZERO Fight Scenes so Expendables III, one scene of Entourage, Fast and Furious 7, in this movie Mile 22 no fight scenes just sadly ZERO poorly they have given her nothing to do besides doing her action scenes just shooting and acting that's all no fight scenes when they hired a UFC Fighter and now she is a WWE Wrestler Champion. She is right the actually right female fighter to be in this movie not getting Lauren Cohen in this movie when she doesn't know any fights or does Martial Arts nothing like that. This is an Action movie not an Academy award winner Oscar film. Ronda Rousey has right role for her action movie in this character, I never liked Non female actress who doesn't know Martial Arts they have to teach actress if person knows it? Give her fight scenes to do something? Jeez that's one problem with this movie. At least give Ronda Rousey 1 or 2 fight scenes but sadly I don't know who to blame for someone not giving her fight scenes is an idiot. Another problem is Camera shaking. It is not perfect but not too bad. It doesn't prevent you from enjoying the movie. Camera shaking. It is not perfect but not too bad. It doesn't prevent you from enjoying the movie. Sometimes I hate movies that is camera shaking I really do but doesn't stop me to hate this movie. I thought Lauren Cohen is pointless mother. After Li Noor (Iko Uwais) The Raid, The Raid 2, Headshot, he is talented in his Martial Arts. He turns himself at the U.S. embassy. Noor is revealed to be Alice's asset and reveals that the disc contains the information regarding the last cesium, but he negotiates for passage out of the country in exchange for the code. The information in the disc is destroying itself and will be rendered useless in a few hours. While Noor is being tested. Axel (Sam Medina) know for Olympus Has Fallen, Kickboxer: Vengeance, Kickboxer Relation, Extraction (2015), Dragon Eyes, Never Back Down 2, Savages. He is villain in movie he is a leading a team from the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency, arrives at the embassy and demands that Noor be handed over. Meanwhile, Noor fends off an assassination attempt by Indonesian 
agents. Silva agrees to take Noor to an airplane, where it is 22 miles away. James and His Team are out of Embassy Composed of paramilitary officers from Ground Branch of Special Activities Division that has to escort a high-priority asset 22 miles to an extraction point while being hunted by the government. While driving, Noor reveals his reasons for turning on the Indonesian government. That's how war started to happen, that's when everything is outta control then action start's to happen a lot of it a lot realistic gun sounds, a lot of brutal violence in movie. When one of characters die you fell sorry for them, I thought Mark and Iko has a lot higher body counts in this movie I Thought action is Slaright forward just goes a lot forward people say oh it's to short how much do you want to be ? 2hr45 minutes, sometimes when movies go short it's better that way because long movie for 2 hours long it gets boring, slow, falling sleep, this is why I love fast paced action movies no matter what I love fast paced action movies, I am super die hard of action this is what makes me to love this movie to death. Fast dialog of any actors including Wahlberg nailed it. This is an action movie - not a drama. More dialogs will make it boring. This movie is very fast. Everything is fast that's how I like movies to be because people like movies that are 2h 12m 2h 31m or 3h 48m well people this isn't Oscar nominee I don't know why are you so interest in this because you think there is a lot of dialog's well nope sorry this is an ACTION movie not a movie to. You will never get bored. No unnecessary lengthy dialog. It is full from the beginning to the end unlike other movies where the director just passes minutes by unnecessary lengthy dialog and scenes. Don't let criticisms to make you hate this movie, DON'T EVEN listen to them, don't even pay attention to them because most likely they are going to be wrong when I say wrong I meant very wrong because at end of day when you watch it. You make your choice if you haven't seen this flick and someone tells you it's bad movie they hate it because it's full on action and it's short not enough story or a lot of dialogs movie would be boring as hell then, they just want you to not to see it for no reason you have reason to see this movie you do this is strongly high recommend at end of day you make choice to whatever you love to death or like it, Critics can say anything and anything but when you watch it you make judgement on yourself not people, and listening it's bad well, tell you what don't believe in them believe yourself to see this movie and make judgement on yourself you will never hate this movie, you will never get bored of this movie if you LOVE full on action, full on martial arts fight scenes, brutal action that's how it is, go and see it no matter what anyone says go and watch it. Mile 22 is an adrenaline rush action thriller, not drama or some movie it will be a Oscar its action movie. It's rated ""R"" for strong violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I really enjoyed this one-except for the ending-and I would buy it on Blu-Ray or 4K, this movie my top list of 2018.",Mile 22

95,stevenrotherforth,Not up to Peter Berg's usual high standards,5,10 February 2019,"Mile 22Mile 22 is somewhat of a frustrating movie.
Forget Hollywood stars such as Mark Whalberg and John Malkovich when you have a martial arts maestro such as Iko Uwais in your movie.
Yet somehow the usually superb director Peter Berg fails to utilise his films greatest asset.
Let's put plot aside for a moment and talk about editing and direction.
This movie is an absolute mess.
As mentioned we have a martial arts star who is supremely talented but here it's almost impossible to see him showcase his talents due to shaky cam and choppy editing.
The fight scene in the embassy is so unwatchable I couldn't tell who was getting their butt kicked.
This is by far my biggest gripe regarding this movie.
As a director Peter Berg is usually fantastic at this sort of thing but here he has dropped the ball big time.
Mile 22 is confusing because the actual storyline is uninspired.
After about fifteen minutes I had lost all interest in the plot and just wanted to see some action.
When the bangs did arrive they were mightily unimpressive.
Even the highway shootout was a chaotic mess.
Ronda Rousey like Iko Uwais was a massively wasted opportunity.
A former UFC great sidelined, instead we have Mark Whalberg's character whining like a spoilt brat for most of the movie.
His character came across as a major A hole.
Mile 22 had all the ingredients to be an action movie feast.
Instead it should go down as one of Peter Berg's worst efforts.
There are some positives.
Namely Lauren Cohens performance.
She proves here she is of star quality and should continue to have a bright career when 'The Walking Dead' finally wraps.In terms of technical aspects, image quality is sharp with little to no grain and sound quality has the usual action movie clout.
I will add that in terms of
Surround effects the audio can get a little muddled at times.
It's a decent sound mix but nothing compared to Berg's superior 'Lone Survivor'.
There's something missing, something that stops this film from going that extra mile.
(Pardon the pun).
I purchased this movie because it was only a little extra to buy rather than rent.
I now realise why.
It's a distinctly average offering and that's being complimentary.",Mile 22

In that regard his close collaboration with one-note Wahlberg is a perfect match.I found the blu-ray in a bargain bin for 50 cents, and even that was too much. Everything about this movie was so amateurish. Berg is completely unable to build suspense or even craft and coherent and believable story. He tries his best to hide this by mounting the camera on top of a paint blender och cutting every ten frames or so. And on top of that we get Wahlberg's ""acting"", which is nothing but pure torture.My friend and I could only take about 20 minutes or so before chucking the disc in the bin.

Had the script been cleaned up a bit, this could have been great.Mark Wahlberg's character was unnecessarily annoying. All they had to do was write him straight up. Instead, they had to make him some borderline autistic genius, which was tremendously awkward and unbelievable. He does this thing where he has to snap some Livestrong wristband when he's uncomfortable or something. Right around this point, you're wondering how the heck this guy ever got recruited by the US government? Gotta be honest, he does nothing in the movie that seems to warrant employing a genius. They could have cut his part out completely, or at least the annoying background story and interview and it would have improved the movie tremendously.Iko Uwais does an amazing job saving this movie. The med center fight is easily the best part of the film; just great stuff. He upstaged Wahlberg's performance completely; his last line in the movie was just golden. I loved it, it was the eff you Wahlberg and his character deserved.Ronda Rousey was perfectly cast. The part suited her and she did her job. Lauren Cohan is gonna be a star, great actress.

Those people usually work in secret organizations or units and deal with national security, acts of war etc.One would think that it takes something special to stand out in such a crowded field, and one would be right. Peter Berg, the director of ""Mile 22"", is not, however, afraid to try.He has succeeded in giving us something a bit different. The good news, the result is shorter than usual in the genre, only 94 minutes - thank heavens for some movies actually being satisfied with lasting less than two hours).The bad news: being shorter and different have come at the expense of viewer-friendliness.""Mile 22"" is all action and almost nothing else. This is not a problem in itself but I have a troubke with the fact that most of the time, I could not really even quite understand what was happening on the screen.It's this specific hectic style of producing and editing action scenes that can look cool when done right, but oftentimes just confuses and tires the viewer.This trend is not new, it's been around since 2002's ""The Bourne Identity"" but this rarely gives great results. And ""Mile 22"" has achieved a new low.Berg has taken this visual whirlwind approach to the max, making both action- and all other scenes difficult to follow. Most of the camerawork is from angles which don't give a satisfying overview of the place and people in it, and it gets worse when bloodletting starts.The physical discomfort is also accentuated by sudden and creepy sounds, a trick usually more associated with horror movies.Yes, the result feels original - but also hectic, and a bit mind-numbing. It's like a badly put together video-game with a sorely lacking camera system.It doesn't help that there is no peaceful moments to let us rest compose ourselves here and there. The characters and dialogue are aggressive and intense too. Not that there's too much conversation - usually it's monologue or just barking orders.Honestly, a flow like this feels more characteristic to documentary or trailer than a movie.Even the leading man Mark Wahlberg, usually known for mild-mannered appearances, is pumped-up, biting, and in-your-face all the time, coming off as a weak personality rather than a true leader as probably intended.Personally, I am sad that there's so little of Indonesian martial arts / action star Iko Uwais, known for ""Serbuan maut"" (""The Raid"") and its sequel, ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" (as Razoo Quin-Fee), and ""Man of Tai Chi"". Maybe we see more of him later, ""Mile 22"" has been planned as a start to a trilogy.It was refreshing to see major female characters - played by WWE/MMA star Ronda Rousey and ""The Walking Dead's"" Lauren Cohen - being ruthless and cold-blooded killers too. But they have relatively little screen time as well.""Mile 22"" is certainly not boring, and from what I was able to gather, the action looks cool too. But this kind of super-intense approach feels like overcooking it, even for an actioneer.Many others have been even less generous than me, as evidenced by the critics' and users' scores at Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic (ranging from 23/100 to 5.3/10).",Mile 22

If you didn't, you wouldn't be reading this review right now. And in fact, you're probably a fan of Peter Berg. I mean, ""Lone Survivor?"" ""Deepwater Horizon?"" ""Patriots Day?"" That guy knows how to direct action! At least, that's what I used to say, until I watched ""Mile 22.""From a two-on-one brawl in an FBI medical room to a shootout in the middle of the road that leads to a fist fight in a bakery, ""Mile 22"" is filled with incredibly cool set pieces that you won't actually be able to enjoy because the quick cuts and shaky camera make it completely impossible to tell what's actually happening. The editing also is some of the most questionable I have seen. For example, one scene that includes a car chase that cuts from the villains chasing our heroes, to our heroes inside of their car, to a birds eye view of people watching them, to a control room full of law enforcement personnel, back to the birds eye view, back to the control room, and back to our heroes, all within 7 seconds. It's maddening, because the editing never gives you enough time to focus and digest what's happening. And because of that, you won't be able to force yourself to care. But that wouldn't matter if the action made up for it, and it would if Peter Berg and crew actually edited and filmed it in a way that made it possible to comprehend.However, with all those complaints, I have to say that the ending of this movie did enhance my enjoyment of the film. I won't spoil exactly why, but it's something that doesn't really happen in a lot of action films and it actually and legitimately made me excited to see. However, keep in mind this is the final few minutes of the movie, and to get to it you have to sit through a cacophony of seizure inducing madness. As the credits rolled, I asked myself, was it worth it? No.5/10",Mile 22

Li holds vital information where the missing radioactive Cesium is and will only give up the code to its location when he gets to the plane. The gov't of Indocarr (fictional), a city in southeast Asia, wants this low level policeman, Li Noor, back and they do everything to hinder that 22 Mile ride to the airstrip. The Russians are involved too.The movie opens with a raid on a Russian Safe House and small boy is also killed. Near the end, Jimmy will say the wrong boy was killed.
Off and on we see Jimmy in flashbacks give an After Action briefing as he relates the story that we see of that trip to the airstrip.Mile 22 refers to the distance (22 miles) between the U.S. Embassy and the air strip. Maybe the title should have been the Gauntlet, but that assumes a route with no stops. Jimmy Silva and team do stop from time to time to change cars and battle the troops of the Indocarr government.This is very violent and sometimes brutal and one can almost feel like we are there and a part of this Black Ops mission. We see a very angry Jimmy Silva who is angry at everyone. You will also see Iko Uwais as Li Noor do a very credible job ala Bruce Lee in fight mode. These are very brutal scenes.
The acting all around is very good. The pacing is fast and furious (Ah, you couldn't resist)Notables: Lauren Cohan as Alice, Agent on Silva's team; Ronda Rousey (yes, that Ronda, the MMA fighter and champion) as Sam Snow also a member of Silva's team; Terry Kinney, John Porter, CIA chief; and Peter Berg as Luke, Alice's husband and he also directed this movie.There is a very big twist later on and this leads me to believe there will be Sequels.And there is very big question never addressed: What happened to that radioactive Cesium?? Huh? Maybe we will know the answer in the Sequels. Hmmm.............. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

The whole nine yards: A group of Russian spies had infiltrated the United States and set up their espionage headquarters in a suburban house. The American counterintelligence guys take down the group but the Russian spies decide to shoot it out with the Americans and are killed. One of the spies is the son of a female Russian bigwig. The bigwig's maternal instincts take over and she chances WWIII, expends tremendous Russian assets, as she plots her revenge on those she believes responsible for her son's death. A lot of impossible action shots only very loosely connected (Poor connectivity), unrealistic firefights & one on one combat, might make some believe it is 'non-stop' action. All the characters were mentally ill psychotics/weird. More hollywood propaganda telling women not to be women but try to be men, which usually translates be a hateful b-witch. hollywood had to throw in their bigoted anti-Christian swat with the 'Jesus guy' slant.

The opening scene sets its hooks in you, is a great action scene with palpable suspense. After that, about 40min of talking, much of it overlayed narration by Wahlberg, who I wanted to mute after the 30min mark. Now that's bad. About 50min in and things get interesting. Action scenes that are gritty and very well done, violent and ruthless. I remember the editing being a bit too choppy but after my third watch it seemed just fine. Something I really enjoyed about this movie, contrary to most action flicks, as sadistic as this sounds, is that the protagonists never really catch a break. One bad thing after another. It made for some tangible tension and sucked me in; by the one hour mark I'd forgotten about all the painful dialogue. There's a little more of that to come, but minimal. The hand to hand sequences with Iko were exceptional, and I especially loved the tenacity of Lauren Cohan's character.

The film is full of powerful action, explosions and some awesome fight scenes. This film really suprised me, Mark Wahlbergs character James Silva was a very strict and tough CIA operative. He was a CIA operative who was aided by a top secret tactical command unit as they are tasked with smuggling a mysterious South East Asian police officer carrying highly classified information out of South East Asia. On the 22 mile mission the team soon realise they'e not just against the clock but against the citys gangs, police and military who are dead set on reclaiming the renegade officer and the information he carries.

One idiotic fight and car chase after another...The really depressing thought is that they are clearly setting the audience up for a sequel. Director Peter Berg and his action hero Mark Wahlberg are predictable once again. For a movie so excited to tell a story about the CIA's most highly-prized and least understood unit, it sure doesn't do much to ensure you leave any more informed than you were when you came to the cinema. But to be honest ""Mile 22"" delivers precisely what's expected from a violent, action film.

124,lotekguy-1,Good concept for action flick sunk by stunningly inept execution. Huge disappointment,2,16 August 2018,"Mark Wahlberg has starred in many fine films. Peter Berg has directed many fine films. Occasionally, the two have overlapped. This action opus is not an example of either. It's a bigger dud than any unexploded bomb Wile E. Coyote ever bought from Acme. The premise had potential. After an opening SWAT-style raid on Russian infiltrators, Wahlberg and his team of CIA operatives head for Southeast Asia to try recovering stolen nuclear material that could fuel a batch of dirty bombs. When their tip from a local cop (Iko Uwais - Indonesia's Tony Jaa, who is Thailand's Jet Li, who is China's version of what Steven Seagal still THINKS HE IS) comes up empty, they wind up having to get him out of the country ASAP as his price for telling them where it is NOW. The title refers to the distance from the US Embassy to the evac airstrip which they must traverse against overwhelming opposition. The clock is running on that window, while local forces try to wrest Uwais from the Americans, and a big high-tech Russian plane flies above the action with its own mysterious agenda. That's a lot of plotlines for a hectic shoot- em-up flick. Too many. On the plus side, the script does offer a couple of twists at the end, but one is to set up a sequel that should never be produced; or at least crafted by a new set of writers, editors and director. This one is swamped by dialog so bad that even a whiz like John Malkovich can't make his lines as the head honcho work. Most action sequences are so choppy and/or underlit that they're indecipherable. One should always be able to tell who is killing whom, to know whether each new corpse is a plus or a minus for our heroes. All told, this is one of the most missable films of the year.",Mile 22
125,plasticanimalz,Loved It,8,26 November 2018,"The only reason I knew of this film is 'cause my nephew mentioned being excited to see it when it came out in theaters and I'm always looking for bonding angles with my nieces/nephews. And in some of these efforts I've realized that some of the military/cop action films I actually enjoy. The ones I've seen, at least, have been much better than the crappy action franchises that permeate the theaters ranging from cars, to robots, to superheroes, to special agents. I used to love action films but they just suck so bad these days. No story. No originality. Even watching this on vacation on a small TV with terrible audio I managed to be enthralled from beginning to end.I was surprised to read multitudes of bad reviews, but, of course, some of the reviewers (trolls) don't seem to know much about the film other than the description on the box. A lot of reviewers complained of bad language? Uh, did they think they were going to a Disney film? And an overwhelming amount of reviewers didn't seem to get the film. My guess, a lot of young guys or men with short attention spans. Even with not great audio on the TV I was watching I could keep up with what was going on. The reviews reminded me of Prometheus. A lot of IMDB reviewers were completely lost by that film and were angry about it, which, it had a fairly easy plot to follow if you simply listened the whole way through. It was like overnight IMDB had adopted these new reviewers who could not keep up with films and I wondered if it was the short-attention-span millennials joining the rank of reviewers. That would make more sense since, dumb-dumb action films always get overwhelmingly good scores, things with plots and storylines, people seem to hate, and people are overwhelmingly angry and negative on here, which is kind of a new thing in the past 6 or 7 years. People used to analyze and enjoy films on here and give authentic ratings rather than simpleton 1 if you don't like, 10 if you do. I enjoyed the days when only entertainment professionals knew about this site and serious film buffs.Anyway, the action was great, I didn't have a problem with the moving camera, as that is in a lot of films and TV, and added to the extreme situations going on in the film. The yelling fit into Mark Wahlberg's character and his urgency of what was going on in the film, so, honestly, I hadn't noticed it until I read reviews. I would have liked to have seem more from Rhonda Rousey but I imagine her acting is probably not great, so it made more sense she was the silent type, and it was actually funny for me in certain moments when she just gave a reactive look or responded with just a word. So, she did a good job there with very subtle comedy. At first I was annoyed by the rubber band snapping of Mark Wahlberg's character but I thought his character was great and he did a great job, and I gathered the rubber band was to temper him from being worse. His character, while a raging douche in most normal situations, was perfect for his job. The brunette woman commando in the film seemed to be the Mark Wahlberg buffer so we don't absolutely hate him. He takes it up a notch and she takes it down a bit and humanizes them so they don't come off like jerk robots. Her, Wahlberg and their transport were the highlights for me and really carried the film along with the excellent action sequences. If not for cutting away to Mark Wahlberg when he's in a deposition maybe the non-stop action would have been a bit grueling? I don't know. They way Peter Berg told the story was very effective. It was kind of like an amped up episode of Homeland. Good story, lots going on, and lots of action and thrills. Some said there was no character development. I don't think they saw the same film. Each character was distinct and they did a good job of telling who they were in a short amount of time. Short because the majority of the film was action. And I appreciate they didn't spend a half hour explaining in long exposition who everyone is...THEN 90 minutes of action. Dragging action films out into 2.5+ hours is exhausting and simply bad directing. Really it's a destruction of art and the result of non-creative executives trying to stick their hands into everything, including the creative process. This is what almost ran Disney into the ground until they fired Eisner and the rest of his lackeys and started fresh. I think this is another wave of executives trying to outnumber the creatives and prove their roles and skyrocketing salaries and bonuses. Basically, entertainment industry big government.I intend to watch Mile 22 again, simply to catch some of what I missed on the dinky TV at our vacation rental. Very enjoyable and I would watch the sequel, if they make it, which I doubt, but I would watch another Peter Berg film based on my enjoyment of this one.",Mile 22

It's got modern shoot-em-up gun scenes, It has ""24""-like real time drone overwatch and magical ability to manipulate any electrical circuit remotely, apparently. And unfortunately, it kills whatever credibility that some people like by making people impervious to a dozen hard blows that would fell an NFL linebacker in three strikes.But the worst most annoying, and very distracting thing from beginning to end is its machine-gun stutter rhythm of dialogue. Most of it is delivered by Wahlberg, whose excuse is he's some sort of mentally ill savant, but somehow is trusted with the holiest of holies of US ultra-secrets. Remaining bits of distracto-talk are spat out by co-star Lauren Cohan, of Walking Dead fame. The dialogue was intentionally sculpted that way and shot by veteran action director/actor Peter Berg, whose stuff I like more than most, but this time he tried too hard to be ""intense.""And then there's the plot. Yes, it has a twist, but it's not delicious, and it's hard to care about it, because we never emotionally invested in the characters in the first 80 minutes. This movie doesn't slow down enough to give us time to care about any of the characters, so when they hit us with the twist, I'm like, ok, but so what? The script commits a major movie sin -- hints to the twist aren't even teased to us as the movie unfolds. For O'Henry-style twists to work, we're supposed to be able to go back through the movie and say ""oh yeah, THAT's why they included those lines, or that camera reveal."" That's not included in this movie.I'm curious how this project got to where it is, because John Malkovich is not only in it, but he actually delivers something a little different than his usual, though mostly he just ""directs"" into microphones, as if he's the second unit director of his own real-life real-time action flick.Wahlberg acts like he's trying to out-obnoxious Jack Bauer, and he mostly does, making him possibly the most unlikable American super-spy in recent Hollywood history. Of course, like most of his movies these days, Wahlberg co-produced this.So why is Malkovich in a throwaway like this? To get a bigger footprint in the lucrative Chinese film market, of course. This is a Chinese-produced film by the Huayi Brothers, a Chinese entertainment conglomerate. A fraction of the China movie audience equals the entire American movie audience. All the smart American actors are doing it.I gave this six stars because that's my minimal score for action movies I can bear watching, because I dig the genre. But it really should get only five stars. It's a big miss in several ways if you're not a teenaged boy who lives on first person shooter video games.",Mile 22
148,Eric_Cubed,"Awful, just awful. Nothing more to say than ""awful.""",2,22 December 2018,"This is a bizarre movie. The opening scene is just as good as any Bourne or Sicario like scenes. This is followed by probably one of the most abstruse, convoluted and disconnected series of scenes with Marky Mark and the woman from The Walking Dead. The absolutely incomprehensible screenplay, hideous editing and complete lack of character development or synergy among the cast will make this movie fodder for film school students about what not to do, ever. It's beyond nonsensical. Did not these writers watch 24? If a minor player has verifiable evidence of nuclear annihilation and request immunity, you don't keep telling him, ""just give me the information."" You give him everything he wants (and kill him later if you want). And then something great happens, an attempted assassination and fight scene, wonderfully shot and choregraphed ensues. I am able to tear my gaze from my computer, watching intently again. There is a vague understanding John Malkovich has ghosted Marky's team. The question of how the first scene went wrong is unanswered, as what the intention of the shadowy Russian spies is. We do know, that because of M&M's screw up from the first scene is that he must stop nuclear materials from being made into bombs (and I'm pretty sure scrapping uranium paste with a paint chisel isn't how making such a bomb goes down). We are lost, left longing, adrift, gaslit, wondering if perhaps we are too stupid to see the Gestalt of it all (the whole is more than the sum of the parts). But nothing could be further from the truth. Again, the directing, editing, screenplay are so massively inept one wonders if a teenage Spielberg could have done a far better job. A coordinated chase and gunfight ensues-again, competently constructed and enjoyable. But it's almost like they used a ""scene generator"" instead of an actual director. And I've never seen such awful acting from Marky. Here's the rub though, it's not his fault. He does his best to bring life to a completely lifeless script. I imagine a seasoned actor in such a situation, knowing full well the futility of it all, would just do his best to channel Kiefer Sutherland for every scene, as opposed to losing himself in the role and expressing something authentic and engaged (which M&M is perfectly capable of, for example, ""Boogie Nights). Think of the best movies as a ""flow"" experience; all factors melt into one another until a zone based grand scheme is produced. Breaking Bad is a prime example of this. This movie is an example of Seinfeld's George's realization that in order to succeed, he need only do the opposite.",Mile 22

154,filmtravel101,Terrible wanna be Bourne Film - more like cheap Indonesian film,3,28 August 2018,I usually really enjoy Peter Berg films and a big fan of Walhberg... but this film was terrible on so many story plot and action/character levels that it just sucks. It is a wanna be Bourne film without any of the style or imagination and is like a tv series gone bad.Spoilers: the film plot is just plain silly... a russian boy is killed and now the highly ranked spy mother... decides to seek revenge upon the Bourne wanna be Team via a Triple Agent. That is it in a nut shell. Here is the stupid part... the team drives through Indo city getting shot and blown to hell... but at the end... the main bad guy is blown out of his car by a drone - that has been available the entire time.. but they only use it at the end. Huh? It is that type of silly writing that makes it just almost unwatchable.. and Walhberg is not the one that shines.. it is Iko Uwais with his indo style gymnastic moves like in the Raid and his other films. But Walhberg barely does anything except mouth off and act supposedly bi polar... that is his character for 2 hours. Pathetic. Sure hope there are no sequels to this piece of junk. How did this get green lit makes one believe that Hollyweird is that desperate these days for junk stories that rip off other premises. I give it 3 stars mostly for Uwais.,Mile 22

157,neener3707,"Not What I Expected, Liked Some Of It, But Very Generic",5,17 August 2018,"So for me, and likely many others, the initial draw was Iko Uwais, because I'm a big fan of the movies hes in like The Raid movies and Headshot. And don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed a couple of the action scenes, but for the most part it was not what I expected, I felt like I was given a false impression of the movie from the trailer. The trailer gave me the impression it would be a non-stop The Raid-style film, but it wasn't. And while, like I said, I liked a couple of sequences, much of it was generic shooting back and forth. First off, I did like some action sequences, mostly the hand to hand kung-fu and whats known as gun-fu involving Iko Uwais, which clearly had Asian influences, but the other gun play left something to be desired, mostly generic shooting back and forth, interspersed with random interruptions that kill some of the action. So all in all I'd say the action was half and half, some I liked, some not so much.The story was very textbook, and while parts of the ""twist"" ending were predictable, some of it wasn't if you don't read a lot of espionage novels. My brother was much more impressed with the ending than I was. I expected some of it. Also, the framing device used is also hit and miss, sometimes there was good writing and good one-liners, but some of it was admittedly stupid, and killed my action buzz a few times.I also did like Lauren Cohan's character, who was more engaging and bad ass than Marky Mark. To avoid spoilers I won't drop names, but the seemingly premature and unnecessarily early death of a character kind of pissed my off a bit because I liked him/her. Most of the cinematography was also pretty textbook blockbuster action flick, not too much that special, not to mention the ""drone vision"" shots looked very unauthentic.If you want a generic action flick sprinkled with some very cool moments, go see it.",Mile 22

171,Eric266,Another Action Thriller; No New Ground Covered,6,7 November 2020,"The name of the movie is Mile 22, but the imagination and plotting feels like the creators of the film ran out of ideas about mile 6. It starts out like an intense political thriller in the vein of The Kingdom or even S.W.A.T. The opening sequence of the elite squad taking down a Russian spy cell in a US suburban home is superbly written, acted, and directed. It gave me hope this was going to be something interesting and engrossing. But then it lost steam.Mark Wahlberg is James Silva, the leader of a covert operations team. (Wahlberg plays Silva as a complete a-hole and no reason is given for why he is such a jerk to everyone, including his team. His character is impossible to like).
He and his team fly to a fictional Indonesian city in the country of Indocarr to recover an asset who has vital information about the group in the Russian cell. The asset asks to be given asylum in America so Silva and his team have to escort the asset 22 miles to the airport (hence the boring unimaginative name). The entire time, a Russian surveillance plane is monitoring their actions and communications (how does an elite, covert operations team not have the most high tech encryption for their comms?). Of course, things don't go as planned and we get a routine shoot 'em up movie with lots of explosions, blood and death of indiscriminate bad guys. Its nothing that hasn't been done before.Joining Wahlberg is Lauren Cohan as Alice Kerr, Silva's second in command who has been getting reliable intel from the asset, Li Noor (a superb Iko Uwais). Also on the team is John Malkovich and Ronda Rousey. Sam Medina is Axel, Silva's opposite number as the head of an ""elite"" Indocarr team chasing them across the city. I put elite in quotes because, like most movie bad guys, they just stand there and get shot.I normally don't include spoilers, but in order to register my complaint with the movie, I need to use them. Li Noor is a triple agent, planted by the Russians. The Indocarr team chasing Silva's team are actually the good guys as they know Noor is dirty. This is never really explored. There are a couple of mano a mano scenes between Silva and Alex that are poorly handled. There should be some tension and respect between them, but its played so ham handed that it just appears they are two macho guys who someone put in charge, rather than experienced, craft adversaries.No one's motivation in the movie matches what a normal person would do. Noor's purpose for being a triple agent is to lure Silva and his team to Indocarr. But then during the race across the city, he has ample opportunity to kill Silva or Alice, but routinely saves them. The information Noor has is of no use to the Indocarr government so their sending 100 guys to capture him is a useless waste of resources. For a team leader, Silva makes some incredibly dumb decisions. After being trapped in a diner by Axel's team, he walks out in broad daylight to confront Axel. Axel, for his dumb part, doesn't order a sniper to shoot Silva on the spot. If Axel knows Noor is dirty, why not just tell Silva or provide him evidence...or even TRY to reason with Silva. He just looks menacing and makes veiled threats. In some scenes Alice is written as a bad ass operative, but then has this lame backstory about a difficult ex-husband and child custody issues. I guess its meant to give her some depth, but its so poorly handled it actually detracts from her character in my opinion.I understand this is supposed to be a trio of movies so maybe some of this stuff gets cleared up in later versions, but there were times, I found myself losing interest and tuning out the movie. If the next two change my opinion, I will raise my rating.",Mile 22

A script has to help you believe in the characters & help the viewer accept whatever is motivating the character to do something in each scenario & then no matter how far fetched you take the story so long as one accepted scene leads to another you will take your audience with you on an incredible journey ( however once your audience starts to keep saying to themselves ""that person would never do that"" over & over + ""why would that character do that as it makes no sense"" over & over you destroy that vital & real connection that is needed for the audience to be able to enjoy a good story ).",Mile 22

182,Scarefish,Mom's Spaghetti,1,24 August 2018,"Mile 22 is a bottom of the barrel action flick that barely manages to look like a theatrical release despite a $35 million budget. Everything you hate about the genre at this point is in full force here with very little done well and some sort of suicide squad of a cast that goes together about as well as spaghetti and ice cream.This film features Marky Mark at his absolute worst. There are so many cringeworthy dialogue moments riddled throughout the film that are literally worse than those in Transformers: The Last Knight. He tries to sound cool by tossing in naughty words and adding a whole lotta sass, but he comes off as such a tool that our supporting characters even call him out for it, not that they're much better.The cinematography is awful. The camera is so shaky that I can only assume Michael J Fox was the cameraman. There are more cuts in this film than upon an MCR fan's wrists. There it is nearly impossible to tell what is happening in any given action scene with how spastic the editing is, and it's a shame since there seems to be some good choreography that's completely destroyed. There's one relatively good sequence in which Uwais has to fight off a couple of assassins whilst strapped to a bed, and it is really lively and fun.The special effects are atrocious. The digital squibs look like They were taken straight from Itchy & Scratchy, and the explosions seem to be set to silly harmless knock back mode, as characters constantly take minimal damage from grenade explosions at point blank range. It is beyond unrealistic where it would be unacceptable even if it were parody, which it isn't.The film is constantly going for rule of cool, but it is incredibly lame and transparent. It feels edgy and surface level, pretentious, preachy, shallow, and just stupid for lack of a better term.The politics seem rather muddled throughout the movie. There seems to be some republican stuff thrown in, though it could be ironic, because there's also feminist undertones apparent throughout the film as well. I'd assume this movie would only appeal to the least critical of republicans, and probably mostly no democrats. The dialogue is just atrocious at times, but thankfully just about everything said is of no value to anything and none of it is dragged out beyond the lame delivery.The pacing is painfully slow and the movie feels like a marathon despite not actually being all too long. The synopsis isn't even covered until the 40 minute mark, and then what little of the story is left to be told is rushed through in what feels to be a series of single tales.There is barely even a plot to this film, which wouldn't be all too terrible if it had style, which it didn't. The twist ending is awkward, and might have been surprising if I was at all invested in the characters, though if I were I probably would have clues in, especially since it would have to have been executed with more clarity to be a more relatable film with punch to it.Pretty much nothing in this movie works and it's probably one of the worst films this year, which is quite something as it's been a very weak year thus far.

188,SweetWilliam63,Dull Elimination Race,6,3 May 2019,"'Mile 22' seems like it was based on a video game a la 'Max Payne'. Short on brains and long on action. Initially the movie seems grounded in a heightened reality about black ops and then Iko Uwais shows up and the overly choregraphed unrealistic fight scenes dispel any hope of this being anything but a silly Hollywood action movie. Wahlberg's character has nothing new to offer either. Wahlberg is a fine actor when he has something to work with ('Three Kings', 'Boogie Nights', 'The Gambler', etc.) and when he doesn't he plays the petulant, half cocked, over bearing, hard ass cop/agent/soldier he played in 'The Departed', 'Patriot's Day' , 'Lone Survivor' and 'The Other Guys'. Lauren Cohan and Ronda Rousey actually come across as realistic espionage agents. Take away the cartoonish fight scenes and this might have held up. The fast cut editing can't make up for the boring and predictable plot.",Mile 22

But OMG, if this actor is doomed to continue this path, his career wil go like Cage's or Willis' down the drain.Even though the movie is entirely action packed from beginning to end (with a not so bright twist), it never captures your attention, there's nothing compelling.
It has all the characteristics of a B-movie. Even more so, because the acting of Wahlberg is even bad. He's like an idiot on speed babbling and shooting his way through the whole movie.

190,northernpaladin,Don't believe the haters,7,25 April 2019,"Wahlberg and Berg have made some fine films together, Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day being two good examples and even though this isn't one of their best Berg still manages to get something from Wahlberg which is more than flexing his physique. The basic plot of deniable operatives racing against time while at the same time being compromised is a well trodden path these days but Berg gives us a strong build up and interesting characters whose trajectory is worth watching. For once John Malkovich has a decent role and the lesser supports are more than just ciphers. The action is uncompromising but equally believable and the plot denouement certainly reasonable enough within the film's overall context, although it's finality is perhaps a little sloppy. Quite why people are rating the film at sub 5 stars I just don't get given the extraordinary ratings given to some of the Marvel dross being churned out these days I can only assume they are the usual Wahlberg haters who can't give the guy a break whatever he's in.

All the swearing and macho mentality really felt like a tiresome obligation after a while.With that being said, has anyone noticed that this film is basically a bad remake of NIGHTHAWKS from 1981?

201,Nolamoviedude,Choppy mess,4,19 August 2018,"Mile 22 has a ton of star power but unfortunately the script is awful and the direction is choppy as hell. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Lauren Cohen(Maggie from Walking Dead) and Ronda Rousey as CIA operatives. They along with a few others invade a Russian safehouse full of Russian spies and kill them all to start the movie. The movie then fast forwards to 16 months in the future to an American Embassy in a made up Asian country. So we can tick off Russians but not the Thai or Vietnamese people? Anyway Mark Wahlberg's character is a complete jerk with an ADD or Tourette's Syndrome like tick where he flicks a rubber band on his wrist. This gets on my nerves after a while because it is so overdone. He and his crew are trying to find some sort of biological weapon that Cohen's source has screwed up. Cohen then goes into a tirade while Facetiming her ex-husband and young daughter. None of this has anything to do with the overall story but they tried to dig deep into their characters and it serves zero purpose!Anyway, the source has the key to finding the bombs but he wants asylum in America so they have to drive 22 miles through made up Asian country while fighting the special forces of made up country. Turns out dude is a triple agent actually working for a Russian mom who's angry they killed her son 16 months earlier. So everyone dies except Wahlberg who actually pulled the trigger and killed her son. A lot of good action but the story around the action sucked. Underutilization of John Malkovich and Ronda Rousey, who I though did good jobs with what they were given. Why have an action movie with Rousey and not really use her in a fight scene?

Those phones they used were unrealistic, plot line with Lauren Cohen and her way too old of a husband Peter Berg was ridiculous! He is way too old and a sucks at acting and she was over the top acting when it came to her daughter. That story line was way over dramatic.
Did Berg and Wahlberg try to make a movie with such an unbelievable plot line but the action saved this movie? Maybe. Also what's up with that ending?
The good: Decent acting job by Wahlberg, good job by Cohen and Rousey did a great job! Great action scenes and fighting by Iko Uwais. His acting isn't why we watched this movie, but his martial arts is superb.

Unfortunately, Mile22 is a great example of what happens when almost every department of production falls short.The premise should be simple. So why the film jumps around randomly, with no indication of time passed or location is beyond reason. The film essentially presents is with a series of random segments, that never pay off with a reward.It's actually quite remarkable that they took one of the best modern martial artists and failed to give us any memorable action sequences. Part of that is down to one of the worst camera directions I've seen in years. Characters appear on the left in one frame, before a camera angle change. Suddenly they're in the bottom right. Another change, now it's another angle of a different room. Suddenly we're back with the first actor, but now they're top left, we see them for half a second and we're cutting again. It's just poor, lazy filmmaking. There are rules for camera work, change of angle? Then your character is at least in the same place in the new frame. It's really amateur errors that make this so bad.Plot is basic, dialog is appalling, camera work unprofessional and the script....who the hell wrote that script? Imagine watching an hour and a half of Mark Whalburg and not being entertained. That's the film's greatest achievement. They took a reliable action man and made him boring and stale. Well done.

A relatively low level agent determines the importance of an ""asset"". Further, there is an unnecessary domestic subplot that lends nothing to the movie.

As a matinee, it should score a 7, but no movies should budget, cast, script and edit scenes with an aim to impress matinee audience, right?The movie budget was only $35Million, a tell-tale sign of ""let's hold off the good scenes / plot for part 2 and 3"". When well-known director Peter Berg and Oscar-nominee Mark Wahlberg are part of the movie, audience' expectations (and disappointment) naturally doubled.The movie did feature many intense action scenes, from shoot out on the road, in buidlings, to hand-to-hand combat. However, I couldn't enjoy these moments due to frantic camera work and choppy editing. I'm going to watch the Raid, Equalizer, John Wick, and Taken again...action scenes should be fast plus fluid, not choppy.90 minutes is a good running time for this simple rescue action movie to be entertaining - but the screen time was wasted by repeated dialogues such as the captain keeps asking his team ""can you handle this?"". To waste more screen time, the team captain James Silver ""reports"" / narrates some over explanation of corruption, politics and human nature, all of which are already understood by crime thriller and spy action fans. Half of James Silver's rambling can be forgiven due to his PTSD and hyperactive condition, but the other half? Edit out!Some positives: the rest of the rescue team and Iko Uwais, with limited screen time and lines, managed to make their characters half-decent memorable. Even John Malkovich's eloquence couldn't save the movie. And the baddies? I can't understand some of them, as their evil plot conversations were spotty and mumbling.

The film is an exercise in excruciatingly bad film-making. Film schools need to use this as a lesson in how not to make a movie.Shocking shaky-cam cinematography. It bounces everywhere. All. The. Time.Editing is truly HORRENDOUS. It is impossible to follow anything that is going on as cuts happen 3 to 4 times a second in the action sequences and if you're lucky in the non-action scenes you might get a 2 second cut that shakes all over in a frantic attempt to look exciting. It doesn't.What's worse is there is no continuity between the cuts eg 'the hero' gets hit by a person from his left. The next cut is of the same two fighters but from the other side so the hero gets hit from the right BY THE SAME PERSON!
Editing 101 says that's generally a very bad idea especially when it's in an edit that's a third of a second and then keep doing it from different camera positions, means the action is totally incoherent.Add to this, seemingly random fast cuts of security cams and 'support agents' and screens with health monitors... It's a complete mess.Hint to directors: let Iko Uwais control his own fight scenes.

222,pinemaples,"22 Miles Too Long, Half an Hour Too Short",5,26 August 2018,"Mile 22 is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed the premise, which was largely about a team of special forces escorting a foreign defector to a set destination. I read something similar in 2016's All-Star Batman, and it worked really well in both cases. Lauren Cohen performed well as probably the most sympathetic character. I had never heard of Carlo Alban before, but I'll have to start keeping an eye out for other films he's done, because he was outstanding. Additionally. I was very surprised at how much Ronda Rousey brought to the table, especially for one major scene approaching the halfway mark, which is particularly intriguing considering she didn't have a single fight scene in the whole movie. On the topic of fight scenes, most of them featured Iko Uwais (known for The Raid), and each one was very well choreographed and brought a lot of new elements I'd never seen before.Unfortunately, for every high point that brought the movie up, there was something that knocked it back down again. The biggest offender was Mark Wahlberg's character, who the filmmakers seemed determined to make unlikeable. The movie wastes absolutely no time in telling you that, as a child prodigy, he's smarter than anyone could ever hope to be, and they try too hard to balance this by making him annoying, brash, and anger-driven. I feel this wouldn't be as big a problem if it were anyone else, but as someone who's front-and-center in almost every scene, this gets old fast. It was well-performed, sure, but it was very heavy-handed, which was a bit of a running issue here. The film loved to highlight particular themes and little character traits, as if they were saying, ""Hey! Isn't this cool! Look what we did! It's so deep!"" John Malkovich, as the director of Wahlberg's unit, spends a good ten seconds monologuing to himself while his team is knee-deep in enemy fire; I found myself asking if anyone would honestly do this in reality. The villains got the shortest end of the stick as far as writing and performance goes. There was almost no motivation for what was going on, they had very little screentime, many major developments are left unexplained, and not a single one of the antagonists was memorable. They were largely just a bunch of cardboard-cutout comic book bad guys.POTENTIALLY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD:
At a point that felt like it would be the penultimate climax, something that the whole movie had been driving toward finally happens. While we're waiting for the aftermath, anticipating the moment our team regroups, recovers, and takes the fight to the bad guys, the movie just ends. It's extremely anti-climactic and leaves you wondering A) why the movie was only an hour and a half long, and B) where the last 30 minutes is.I enjoyed a large portion of this movie, but I couldn't help but think that they just ran out of budget.

My guess as to why Mile 22 did not do well in the box office was the title. Mile 22. Sounds like a sci-fi movie and you don't get any sense of it being an action film.But it is an action film and a damn good one. Basically, Mark Wahlberg leads a team of U.S. government personal trying to stop a code from expiring and possibly exploding. In order to stop that, they have to work with an agent/spy played by Iko Uwais. Uwais is probably the most in demand martial arts star right now. Anyway, that's where the tension and the action begin. Wahlberg and his team has to trust Uwais' character and they both have to fight through other barriers including government police from another country that they are in. Thrilling with a great swerve in the end.In short, fun and intense with a lot of action. I am a huge action junkie and it was very cool to see this movie on DVD. So sick and tired of comic book movies and it is nice to have a good action movie. Mile 22, in 10 to 15 years from now, will develop a cult following of being a great action film.Mile 22.

229,Marc_Horrickan,Messily Conceived and Realised,4,20 September 2018,"Peter Berg and Mark Wahlberg have collaborated together on some mightily fine 'based on real events' dramas in recent years, so it comes as a disappointment that this South-East Asian spy action film has little of the identity or integrity brought to the likes of DEEPWATER HORIZON and PATRIOT'S DAY. Playing out like a cross between ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and NO WAY OUT, the film features Iko Uwais - breakout star of THE RAID films - as a double-agent looking to come in from the cold. Mark Wahlberg is the thoroughly unlikable, sociopathic special-ops agent tasked with getting this asset from the US embassy to a Stateside-bound flight. In between Wahlberg and the completion of this task is the small matter of the entire Indonesian military. What could have been a frenetic and energetic actioner taking place in a relatively exotic locale and hinting at the duplicities of international intelligence organisations, plays out like a confused and muddled throwback western, without the cowboys and indians. Berg proves to be nowhere near as adept at filming action sequences as he was at distilling the emotional fallout of major US disasters. His normally vital portraits of human's doing difficult jobs in troubling times, is nowhere to be found in this strictly by-the-numbers plot arc. Wahlberg delivers a solid performance as the boorish and irritating James Silva and Lauren Cohan does admirable work with a very thin supporting character, but the audience is given little to invest in and care about in terms of character development. The Indonesian Military are the usual troubling horde of near-faceless mercenaries, while little time is invested in Silva's little band of brothers which are gradually whittled down over the course of the film. Perhaps most egregiously Berg shows no flair for action and violence. The film has a disorienting edit rate that during extended hunt, chase and shoot-out sequences must drop to a cut every second of film. This leaves the action feeling chaotic and muddled, robbing it of any real effective impact, meaning or resonance. The framing of the film doesn't help matters, with a thoroughly unnecessary time structure that jumps forward to Silva's post-op debriefing, robbing the film of even the urgency of a will-they won't-they dynamic. Berg and Whalberg should definitely stick to excavating America's recent past from the working class milieu that they have made their own, as this is nowhere near the quality of their previous efforts.",Mile 22

I generally enjoy Wahlberg in his everyman roles, but other actors could have better delivered on this role. It's a bit of a B movie but not far off a solid action flick if you tune out Wahlberg's character (and it's pretty good if you enjoy his character/performance).I've marked it up 1 because I think Iko Uwais is a star in the making and I enjoyed some of the performances of the 'unnamed' supporting characters.Of course, avoid at all costs if you find American jingoism offensive or distasteful.",Mile 22

The movie might do alright in international sales. Having a local hero from a populous country does help. Vin Diesel got 3 free hits in Xander Cage by including Deepika, Donny and Tony. Four if you include Toni Collette and Ruby Rose.
I have no doubt he can act but I reckon losing 80% of his lines will in no way affect the storyline. Oh and spare a thought for whoever has the task of subtitling Wahlberg's lines.

Mile 22 was a big misfire and I am not saying this wasn't a good action movie because it was. It is entertaining, concise and to the point. I applaud him for that alone. Where things went wrong here, were in the editing department. I feel like if he had not shot this movie in the way Paul Greengrass shot the Bourne films he would have had a winner here. It's angering that he didn't realize this. He literally took that filming style and put it into overdrive.

Alice, dude what was her point in the movie and the whole ex hubby issue with the kid, really? no point to have that and ONLY that family relationship in the movie.The script: Poor writing. They tried very hard to be smart but fell flat. I figured out the Asian guy was bad the moment they questioned him and that was all thanks to the directors panning so heavily on him that you had no choice to but to realize that they wanted you to see him like DUH, if you zoom the camera in on his hands during a lie detector test what do you think we will get from that? Hello people, bring on the obvious train!The action: UGH I dislike movies that have action for the sake of having action. Make it make sense. This is didn't. The ending made me angry because it just ended, no nothing. They didn't need to do a flashback for us to see who was dirty unless you're not very smart and didn't catch it otherwise it was all there.This movie was supposed to be what Extraction was, that is how you do a rescue type film like that. I am so mad that I watched this movie because someone on facebook said it was good and so many people commented agreeing and now I think all of those people have brains the size of peas if they thought this movie was slightly even close to being good.

I was really only excited to see this film to see that man in action again, because he is bone-crushing fierce; his fights are bad-ass and you will enjoy them. His inclusion in the film also gave me hope that Mark Wahlberg would have finally not played such a cheesy character, but unfortunately he met his standards once again. The film dedicates a lot of resources to his character to put off this ""really smart but really aggressive"" vibe, and it doesn't work out, especially since ""The Accountant"" with Ben Affleck pulled that off much better. The film's direction seems split on whether Wahlberg or Uwais should be the star. It was great to see Lauren Cohan (Walking Dead) and Ronda Rousey.

I really liked the way it was filmed, with lots quick cuts. You do have to really pay attention or you'll miss stuff, since there are multiple moving parts going on, Marky Mark's character talks very fast, and it all moves very quickly.Like most, I first noticed Iko Uwais in The Raid, and he's become one of my favorite actors. Simply put, the guy is amazing, seriously. I'm so glad he's finally getting noticed, so he can become as huge of a star as he deserves to be.Marky Mark's character was just perfect for him. I would say, you'll either love him or hate him - I loved him. He's quick, dry, funny, super smart, mentally unstable, and a badass.Sam Medina's character was so likeable and charismatic, he definitely stood out.The reason this movie doesn't get a 10 is, despite all these great things about it, it's missing that *something*. I've seen it 5-6 times now and I still can't put my finger on it. Maybe because it moves so quickly and is only about 1.5 hours long, we don't really get a chance to connect with the characters.

At least 20% of the movie time is the character slapping the rubber band in his wrist. Because of the camera jumps fight scenes are just a bunch of random kicks and closeups that don't mean much. Dialog in many ocassions seems pointless and out of context, like 'want some coffee?' And instead of answering about the coffee you just yell how not achieving the goal will destroy the world (not real quotes from the movie to avoid spoilers, but kinda). Also, because is an action movie, people can not talk as if they were not high on caffeine.

So many quick shots happen you can't even tell what the hell is going on in a single room because you can't see anything other than some blurry hand rushing across the screen.There is literally no character development and no resolution to any of the conflicts in the film. None. Every conflict that occurs in the film isn't solved, either because the film is too short to be able to cover any exposition for it, or because the film wants to shamelessly set up a sequel (let alone, a trilogy) to help flesh out this half-assed story that the audience is apparently supposed to care about. The film ends on a cliffhanger (I won't say what that cliffhanger really is, mostly because I'm actually still confused about it) that leaves the fate of some characters unknown and the audience wondering ""That's it?"" It's like the films thinks that somehow the audience wants more when the characters were barely explored and the action was generic at best.Our characters begin flawed and end flawed; Mark Wahlberg's witty, brash, and comedic portrayal of Silva stays witty, brash, and comedic throughout the movie; in fact, it seems the character is only capable of responding in that way in the face of adversity and near-death experiences. Lauren Cohen's character, Alice, has a storyline focused on her personal life, evaluating her strained relationship with her ex-husband and her love for her daughter (the latter two have a whopping 5 minutes of screentime) that is never resolved or affected by the storyline of the film, or vice versa. Iko Uwais' character has motives only explored by a single line uttered by him, and nothing else, and we're supposed to accept that and be emotionally invested? The characters are given a backstory but not given the time or investment to tell audiences why they should care about these characters, and so when the cliffhanger occurs we're just left confused and annoyed that no characters learn anything through this 22-mile journey and no conflicts are resolved.The film is also structured in such a way that it somehow is predictable; interspersed with the action are scenes of Wahlberg's Silva being interrogated during a government investigation, providing narration to the confusing action and even foreshadowing to the ""big"" cliffhanger and twist of the film, along with the suggestion that ""something goes wrong"" with this mission. It's been done before, and it makes the film so predictable.The great thing about watching this on the premiere was I got free popcorn and soda, and I got to hear Mark Wahlberg stand up in the theater and shout ""Can we start the movie?""",Mile 22

The plot is somewhat far-fetched (no more so than MI) and the action sequences don't go over-the-top. In fact the martial arts scenes are great. For some reason, Berg decided not to really use Rousey in the hand-to-hand fights.The characters are rough and sarcastic, kind of like the military in real life. All of the acting was good. Rousey especially impressed me, not that she was challenged to do some light romcom. But as some 90's martial artists (think Norris, Van Damme, Segal) proved, merely kicking and punching your way through a movie doesn't qualify as acting.So, who is this movie for?

But the take-away here is that he played that character so well that reviewers are actually angry at his ""character""... Which says to me that he achieved exactly what he set out to do... Ergo GOOD acting.
Iko Uwais is an Indonesian treasure, and here he showcases just why.
I can't think of too many Hollywood actors who would have played his part any more credibly. His fight scenes are the expected tornado of death-dealing, with more than a few unique finishing moves, and the dudes deft delivery of dialogue in multiple languages displays his growth as an actor... Not just another pretty face-smashing weapon of mass destruction.
Lauren Cohan and Rowdy Ronda play exactly the kind of female characters I love to watch in action movies, they are 100% believable, they get punched and kicked half-to-death when fighting even only one 250 pound highly trained mercenary, they bleed, but they persevere, they are relentless (because they are playing the big boys' game and they aren't getting cut any slack 'cause they're girls...

The beginning of the movie is so long and slow and doesn't actually develop any rationale for the plot and why the special ops group was there. I's not clear who they actually worked for (Army, Navy, FBI, etc) as at one point Mark resigned from whoever his employer was! 
There are so many potential plots and characters that are started and abruptly stopped, leaving the potential plot and character hanging, (random I.T. ""Geeks""). 
 
At the end, they finally expose the relationship between two characters that everybody had already figured out. But, the full reason why the initial raid was necessary, and why such a high powered raid had to happen in a suburban neighborhood, risking the lives of all the kids playing and surbanites, was inexplicable. Furthermore, the actions, aloofness and sheer stupidity of the group conducting the raid were the actions of a group that are amateurish at best...they were just dumb, on the surface. Later in the movie we learn that one of the unidentified, nameless IT persons is remotely flying a plane that can pinpoint and destroy any opposing force with great accuracy! This revalation makes the entire 22 Mile drive drama unnecessary because it could have protected all the missionaries and ""The package"", making all the shooting and hand-to-hand combat totally unnecessary. But the clueless group proceed to a safehouse that was known by everybody to get a replacement car that wasn't there and never arrived and the group chasing ""the package"" has access to Marks intel computers and can apparently control them, but still allow them to have some success and fight back... while allowing many of their faceless fighters to be eliminated but they had the ability to turnoff their computers whenever they wanted.This thing is a mess!

276,BlueFox94,Coarse & Condensed Action Thrills in Mile 22,5,25 August 2018,"(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)""A battlefield could be a room with two people in it. That's chaos. That's fog."" - Overwatch Agent James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) to an unknown journalistPotential spoilers belowIn the crowded last third of the 2016 movie season, audiences had the opportunity to experience a riveting double offering from director Peter Berg. The first was Deepwater Horizon, which dramatized the real-life explosion at the eponymous Gulf of Mexico drilling rig that resulted in the worst oil disaster in U.S. history. The second was Patriots Day, which dramatized the tragic 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the urgent week-long investigation and manhunt that followed.Both films disappointed commercially, their worldwide box office receipts just surpassing their production budgets. On the other hand, critics received Berg's two 2017 offerings with general praise. Deepwater Horizon even managed to earn Sound Editing and Visual Effects Oscar nominations.These two movies, in addition to 2013's Lone Survivor, saw Peter Berg collaborating with actor Mark Wahlberg. That filmmaker-actor duo hits their first snag with their fourth outing, the action thriller Mile 22. Supporting star and pencak silat martial artist Iko Uwais makes the best of his screentime, though not enough to overcome baffling editing choices and unrefined acting turns from his fellow cast members.CIA black operations agent James Silva (Mark Wahlberg, edging on hypertension) leads Overwatch, a small but formidable U.S. paramilitary team tasked with missions of utmost secrecy and danger. Five shipments of highly toxic cesium exists at one or multiple unknown locations, and the information regarding these locations has been stored in a disc, surrendered at a U.S. embassy in Southeast Asia by Indonesian police officer Li Noor (Iko Uwais). Noor, a covert asset of Silva's fellow Overwatch comrade Alice Kerr (Lauren Cohan), demands immediate passage out of the country and warns that the disc is slowly destroying itself and will become useless in several hours. Under the remote supervision of James Bishop (John Malkovich) and with an unknown host of foreign police, military, and street gangs armed and waiting for them along the way, Silva and his Overwatch team (including Ronda Rousey and Carlo Alban) must race 22 miles to the nearest airfield for Noor's extraction, access to the self-destroying disc, and hopefully saving countless lives in the process.Movies like Mile 22 are why I re-watch new releases for long reviews such as this. Initial reactions benefit from confirmation and vindication. Both times I watched this fourth Berg/Wahlberg collaboration, I left the theater with a strange mix of contentment, confusion, and indifference.To start, one must know going in that Peter Berg's non-family friendly action thriller deals with the moral gray area of state-sponsored black operations. ""A government is capable of vengeance. A government is capable of slaughter,"" Silva tells a shadowy journalist. Silva insists and affirms how governments across the globe have generated a ""fog"" in weaponizing the spread of information as well as advancing technology for efficient killing. Silva snidely reminds Alice, shortly before commencing the airport escort of Li Noor, how the consolation of religion contradicts the violence that will forever mark their past. (""Thou shalt not kill,"" yet the government desensitizes such agents to killing in the name of national security.) Death has become the only ""normal"" thing left to anticipate for highly trained operatives like them.This attitude and cinematic vision towards government espionage was popularized by the Matt Damon-starring Bourne franchise that emerged in the early 2000s. Two hallmarks of that franchise as it progressed included shaky camerawork and heavy cutting to ""enhance"" the real stunt work on display. However, those franchise traits opened an action genre Pandora's box, giving imitators license to cut costs via paltry stunt and fight coordination, murky cinematography, and incomprehensible editing.Mile 22 has received much flack for the efforts of editors Melissa Lawson Cheung and Colby Parker, Jr., Peter Berg's go-to editor since 2004's Friday Night Lights. I will admit, after two viewings, that I never truly got lost in the action sequences because of the editing. Instead, it disappointed me that Berg, Cheung, and Parker chose to not capture the full glory of Clay Cullen and Jhon Morales' stunt coordination and Ryan Watson's fight coordination (with Uwais' valuable input). Why cut instead of linger? Why elect to not show us the action rather than actually showing it? Why do many western action filmmakers fail time and again to recognize that the immense fan admiration for the Uwais-starring Raid films (in 2011 and 2014) comes from how those films revel in showing their action?The acting, while not egregious, comes off as though Peter Berg pulled a Clint Eastwood and settled for as few takes as possible. Under Martin Scorsese's patient direction on the set of 2006's The Departed, an amusingly derisive Mark Wahlberg garnered a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Under Berg's direction in Mile 22, Wahlberg takes on little of Silva's mental instability as indicated by the opening titles. Instead, Wahlberg resorts to becoming a bossy jerk who uses a wristband to snap himself into focus. Lauren Cohan gets some backstory as a divorced mother fighting against her ex-husband to bond with their daughter, but she overdoes it when she destroys her mobile device after a heated video call. Finally, while Randa Rousey is fine in quieter scenes, Lea Carpenter's script (from a story by her and Graham Roland) then has her rudely talking down her less prominent comrades and computer analysts.Given Mile 22's low box office returns so far, Berg and Wahlberg might lose the chance to further the story of Silva and Overwatch. Should a sequel remain in the works, it is best that they overcome at once the editing and acting mistakes made by them and their fellow crew members here. Cinema does not need another slice of cake needlessly swiped off a café table.(Parental Note: Mile 22 has been rated R by the MPAA ""for strong violence and language throughout"". It has also been rated L (Limited adult audience) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""pervasive gun and physical violence, some gore, and frequent profanities."")R.N.B.",Mile 22

The highlight and standout from this movie was the action, it was jam packed full of top quality action sequences and the choreography of the fighting scenes was tremendous. Iko Uwais, most famous for his leading role in The Raid, is a tremendous asset to this movie as he delivers superb action and his character always has this strange mystique surrounding him .

This is not suppose to be make believe it is suppose to be believable but they threw that out the window in the first 5 minutes. They would have been better off making this about patients in a VA hospital because the characters they wrote would never be in the military not in the field at least. They could be in a nut house suffering from PTSD and other problems except. Marks character was supposedly mentally ill all his life. No one would be put in charge of a janitors squad let alone a military one when they can't pass a Pysch Eval ! Hey don't worry they made sure his second in command was just as bad and would not pass a Pysch Eval either. 10 minutes into it she already has had 3 breakdowns and these are the people you would trust with your back or with other soldiers life Never. Wait its worse these are the ones you would trust to handle a highly dangerous case that could get 60 thousand or more killed No!

We went from great movies like Seal team 6 and many other showing just how good our soldiers are to this crap. This feels like and anti war hippie wrote this so he could insult every soldier that ever served and make them out to be morons with severe mental problems. Honestly they obviously had the money and budget to make a movie and the actors to do it with they just did not have the writers, the director, the producer etc..

Its waaay to low on RT and, I don't know, I feel like I need to defended but, at the same time I see the issues.The biggest one is of course the editing. It's a movie that is kinda hard to watch because of it, there are cuts and cuts all the time, the shots are weird close-ups, not to mention some of the characters are yelling and are very coarse, especially Wahlberg who can get pretty irritating fast. But, interestingly that might be the point; to disturb us and dizzy us, showing how the titular character might feel about all of this situation, if this was intentional It might be something. Unfortunately there is no real character development or a decent plot to sustain this supposed stylistic choice.Some of the special effects look cheap, I mean, this looks more like a streaming film in several occasions than for theaters.
 
The first half especially is very boring, lots of exposition, character moments that go nowhere and setups that are not strong enough to keep you invested. The second part however gets a bit better the over the top chasing scene is entertaining and has some tension.Both Uwais and Wahlberg give strong performances for tokens basically, and Iko is kind of wasted in this i'm not going to lie and his action scenes seem amateurish for someone who is a professional. Mark in the other hand is the rude american macho and he plays it well, yes, he can be very irritating but I feel it's more of a problem with the script, we needed a bit more info about his character and how he deals with his condition, yeah we have that. Everybody else is... who cares? And this is another twist movie... at this point i'll give it a pass.

The funny thing is that most of the time is different things that make the movie terrible. Take this one, the story is illogical, confused and has more holes than a colander, the action sequences make you seasick and after 20 seconds one wonders who scripted them given how inept the super Mega special agents are, who, for example, fail at basic principles of counterterrorism and protection tactics. At some point in yet another needless, clueless, useless, exchange of fire with some new unknown goons, most of the uber prepared agents shields themselves from SMG fire and grenades behind the doors of an suv... that is when I called it a day and switched off.
Bland, badly directed and cinematograpically inept, illogical and unreal, very weak performance from all characters ( mostly shouting and grunts)

330,AustinSober,The Bergs are Miles Off Course with their Latest Collaboration,2,21 August 2018,"What a mess...and a major step down for the Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg collaborations. This is easily the worst film I have seen in the year 2018. It is a testament to the worst qualities filmmakers can bring to the modern action film, ranked right next to such migraine inducing insults like ""Tak3n"" and ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"".The story is very basic and B-grade: an elite team of off the book operatives have to escort a whistleblower 22 miles to an airstrip to escape his corrupt Southeast Asian nation. If they do so, he will provide the location of a deadly weapon the U.S. wants to desperately find. Trouble is that everyone is going to try to kill them along the way. Despite that painstakingly simple premise, they manage to make the expositional buildup overly complicated. You are thrown into a conflict you don't understand over an objective that you don't feel the magnitude of. This is complete with characters referring to things that already happened with a previous mission that failed which we didn't witness. The exposition being confusing is something the filmmakers must have noted themselves because right before the escort begins, John Malkovich's character literally breaks down the entire setup AGAIN to make sure you, in fact, get it. That is lazy writing and shows that the filmmakers think that the audience is either stupid or is a victim of their own storytelling incompetence. The story is also told in ""flashback"" I guess as it keeps randomly cutting to Wahlberg's character retelling the event (more exposition for those that can't follow this basic premise...again) and also monologuing about random...""philosophical"" things about special ops missions. Nothing he says is actually important. I think he is supposed to be trying to give the film a message or something like a wise man. He is no wise man though, he is just the movie equivalent to fortune cookies drunk on Jack Daniels mixed with Gatorade. Actually, this whole movie feels like a ""Call of Duty"" wet dream... written by those very annoying COD players that are 12 years old and are far too young to be playing a game meant for adults. There is also this constant cutting to some Russian characters. Based on the opening, you know that they have a purpose. The actual outcome of that purpose, however, is sort of like....""oh that's what the deal is....wait why do I care again?""Then there are the characters: all of them are either unlikeable, uninteresting, or an unholy combination of both. The most consistent example is the film's lead Jimmy Silva as played by the usually reliable Mark Wahlberg. His character is like this super hyper thinking soldier that is way off on the mental spectrum. He is super intelligent and obsessive about everything around him and has to use a rubber band on his arm which he pulls and slaps on his wrist to keep him calm. This is could be interesting, but instead, the character is an awkward embarrassment. He is a complete jerk to everyone around him, talks way too fast, and likes to just get right in everyone's faces to yell and complain like a whiny, little baby that lost his raddle. He is a complete a-hole and I honestly wished somebody would just punch him in the face. But his character seems to get off on violence so...perhaps that could just make things worse. He is a horrible character with an embarrassing performance by Marky Mark...right next to the ""The Happening"".Finally, there is the critical sin: the editing and cinematography. This is some the poorest, most incomprehensible action I have seen in quite awhile. Every shootout and fight scene is compromised by ADHD cuts to so many shaky cam angles over and over again. Furthermore, most of the camera work is shot very tight in either close-ups or medium shots. You never get a sense of geography. You never can tell where the ""heroes"" are in context to the enemy. You get the general sense that people are shooting bullets and that people are getting hit by said bullets. They have the guy from the ""The Raid' films in here and they completely waste his talents in his TWO fight scenes. This man can do a whole fight in one shot and they insist on cutting shots every 0.5 seconds as if they are trying to hide poor choreography. But you can tell it's not!! You can tell that in better hands this would be amazing!!! And do not defend this movie's editing and camerawork as being ""realistic"". There are many directors that can pull this style off well. Heck, Peter Berg is one of them! Go watch ""Lone Survivor"", ""Deepwater Horizon"", and ""Patriot's Day"" because those are great examples done right. ""Patriot's Day"" contains one the best ""realistic"" shootouts I can remember in recent years. This is straight up garbage. This is why I praise a movie like ""John Wick"" for getting the action right. That's why ""John Wick' is a 5-star movie in my book. If you think that the way they do the action in this film is good, I am sorry but you might have something seriously wrong with you. Bad taste...very bad. Screw this shaky cam crap! And that makes up half the movie...if not more.Horrible movie. Want something similar that is good, check the 2004 S.W.A.T. movie. It has a very similar plot with better characters, buildup, and action. Need something more recent? Try ""Sicario"".",Mile 22

332,Goettschwan,Built like a 3D shooter,4,10 September 2018,"A run of the mill action film story, built on grandiose premises with shadow ops and superpowers involved, it is nonetheless built quite exactly like a 3D shooter video game. Some ""cutscenes"", another action fest, another ""cutscene"", a shoot out, a ""meanwhile"", ... you get the drift. 
The movie isn't really believable at some point with last ditch defenses to the death, an HQ that has power over everything from traffic lights to (seemingly) which cars are unlocked anywhere in a foreign country, and the military having no time to wait with a cargo plane, while happily flying armed predator drones through the airspace of a country they have an embassy in. 
All in all it was a nice idea. Somebody must have though ""hey, what if the guy from The Raid got caught and the US need to smuggle him out"", which is most of the plot right there. 
A sad note, because the camera is nearly always so close to the actors - or the nearest wall - that you never get a sense of orientation or an appreciation for the moves Iko Uwais dishes out. They could at least spare Uwais the ""five cuts a second"" treatment of his wonderful fight scenes - he has a lot more talent than that. 
Your mileage on this one may vary. I for one watch action movies but I don't ""leave my brain at the door"" like someone in the reviews put it.

Wahlberg, who i generally like, was supposed to be some advanced veteran, but he wound up doing less than everybody else throughout the movie - except 'dialogue' everybody... he had not one standout moment in the movie - no special kill, no great one liners.. just a cold, angry dude.
The story was 'meh'. they rambled through it really quick. No character development, not even wahlberg, who was outlined thorough paper clippings throughout the opening credits... this also meant you felt nothing when someone died... it was ok...

I'd really like to see a count of how many clips there are, but I will not take out the daunting task of doing that myself. This must have been a huge task on the part of the editors. I estimate that the average clip length is something like 1 1/2 seconds, which means there are nearly 4000 clips making up the movie. It's tiring to watch.

I don't know if Mark Wahlberg himself (whom I love as an actor, as a rule) chose to create the most obnoxious, rude, unbelievable character of James Silva, but whoever's idea it was he/she totally succeeded.
James Silva (Wahlberg) is good at his job as a CIA officer but he is a total failure as a human being. I don't care if he is ADHA or bi-polar, blah blah blah, there are meds for that! And everyone in the film gives him a PASS on that for some obscure reason which I don't understand. I get that you have to be somewhat detached to do the kind of job he does successfully, but does that mean he has to act without a shred of human decency and be sarcastic and condescending to his team and virtually everyone with whom he interacts? Mark just basically yells and rants like a mental patient off his meds for the entire movie.
Lauren Cohan's character vacillated between being a one-woman killing machine and a whiny, sniveling divorced woman who can't get her priorities straight when it comes to her only child. I have seen her in other movies and TV shows she has so much more talent than she shows here.
Ronda Rousey's character had some meat to it, however, she is killed off too soon in the film.
And the scene where Alice is being thrown about the room like a ragdoll? Is that believable to anyone? After the first two times every bone in her body would be broken. Come on, I do like a modicum of credibility in my action films.
Iko Uwais turned in a stellar performance and I hope to see more of him in a better vehicle at some point.
No character development to speak of, no conflict resolution to ANYTHING. Does Alice survive? Will she ever see her child again? Does Silva get any reprimands or suspensions?
While the storyline had potential, the writing is lackluster and lethargic. The cinematography is shaky and uneven a lot, so you lose the gist of it at times.

First and foremost I had absolutely NO interest in seeing this movie. We were planning on MI:Fallout but the showing canceled. So we decided on this. I was BLOWN. AWAY. our other option was Meg (titled because its been stated by the director that the typical person is too stupid tonknow what Megalodon was/is). So Mile 22. Wont waste time on the back story. Watch the trailer. I thought it would be a cheap cliche one man fights an army garbage. I was SO wrong. Its a very smart politicial/government/military ops extraction story. Sounds simple enough but the story adds well placed compilations and a minor human side (with out being numbingly cliche). I just dont get the bad reviews. Cliche garbage like supr hero movies and even meg get glowing rave reviews and this gets trashed!? I think people just werent paying attention or where expecting an idiotic ""many bad guys BAD. lots of bullets shooting at good guys! EXPLOSIONS! Good guy wins!"" Or maybe a cheap CGI slow motion cars flipping all over. No. None of that sorry. Just a complex guard and extraction scenario that kept me well enerertained, engrossed, and didnt treat me like an idiot. Also the movie is narrated from a FLASHBACK/RECALL point of view. I think people were thoroughly confused not being able to follow the very well executed editing and narratives (its rather simple if youre smarter than a 5th grader....). I typically HATE quick cuts seldom lasting longer than 2 seconds and shaky cam. Despise more than hate. But I was amazed how well executed the cinematography was. It worked so well! The characters are very quickly and well established with out ever feeling like one was just thrown in or no characters you couldnt care about. Literally my ONLY complaint was the use of shaky cam and quick cuts during the fight sequences. It matches the rest of the directorial direction but longer teackong shots wouldve been better in my option.",Mile 22

Rousey never throws a punch! No offence to Rhonda but she is not an actress, she can fight and fight well, don't under use someone's talents! Much like the majority of Gina carano films of late. Now I know you shouldn't typecast and we have to give a performer the opportunity to widen their talents but the fact this film could have had her fight but didn't, annoyed me immensely.The film also suffered from 20 minutes of completely unnecessary character development for whalberg and Cohan that had no point being there .Overall I'm disappointed for the underusing of rousey I felt as if she should have been in the Cohan role instead .

The acting, effects and cinematography are good, even fine,but everything -besides the action- happens so fast that it's hard to follow the pace. I don't understand why the rush - the theatrical version is just about 1.5 h long. Besides, some parts that would have been quite interesting to watch are almost entirely left to your imagination.

Some of the cast was just loud, and so rude you wouldn't believe that some professional have the privilege to be a loud asshole and curse so much in their life. Because I don't like them at their personality, I didn't really get attached to any of the cast and didn't really care for them beside Iko Uwais.
As for the action scenes (particularly Iko Uwais), which is the main reason I watched this it did deliver but only for a little. Instead, they make him incapable of showing his great martial arts from the raid by making him handcuffed for the latter half of the movie. They replace most of the action in the latter half from melee fight into a chase and shooting scene between characters.
I think the best scene is from when they handcuffed iko uwais in a bed and he have to fight agents with a handicap. It was very well done, but I think that is the only memorable scene from the film for me. It was not such a great film, and i think it will pale in front of the memories since mission impossible fallout screen not too long before this movie premiered.",Mile 22
393,adamafrixal,Wasted Opportunity to Use Iko's Talents for Martial Arts,4,11 September 2018,"The main prontagonist cast Iko Uwais an actor that is a martial artist at heart. This iko uwais play a big role in Mile 22 so I actually have a big expectation for this movie. 
First off, like I mentioned I watched it for Iko uwais. It was a big opportunity for him to share a big screen with a big name actor such as Mark Wahlberg in this movie. I am glad for him as Indonesian and wish that he would get more exposure in the future. It would also cast Laura cohen from Walking dead as one of the investigators, so I think the cast is pretty professional.
In the movie, Iko Uwais act as Li Noor who is a mysterious agent, who has his own agenda tried to approach Mark Wahlberg which stars as James Silva an operative of CIA's highly-prized but disliked unit. Silva and his team must utilize the information from Li Noor to succeed his mission, but in return Li Noor would like to be helped in order to get out of the country. The story is pretty simple but, there are some twist and mystery concerning Li Noor. I personally think it overcomplicate the plot.

I often rely on IMDB ratings, unlike Rotten Tomatoes site which contains critic reviews which cannot be relied on. I also realise people have different opinions but rating this film poorly and other abismal films, like Skyscaper and the Equalizer 2 highly is just silly. This film had me hooked from start to finish. It's an action film and a very good one at that. I'm not even a massive fan of mark wahlberg but loved this film.another is definitely on its way going by the ending so it will be like Jason Bourne but in my opinion better than Bourne and I hope the next one is as good as this one. Nine SARS from me. Yes, you've heard right. It's my kind of film and being a die hard film fan, I think the balance was spot on. I did not notice any shaking cameras, not enough for me to even notice. Utter nonsense reviews out there so watch it and don't believe all the reviewers. Btw, I did not agree with rave reviews when it came to Deadpool either. It was good but no where near as good as what everyone was saying. Then again, I have my own opinion.

Further insult to the viewer is done as each scene is described by lead characters in words just after it finishes, as if the writer assumed that watchers will be of very limited intellectual capabilities.

I know when to cut my losses.::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Treat Mile 22 as a Stock that you purchase, which immediately begins to taper off and hit your stop limit. You sell and ditch it before it devours more of your money (or in this case, time).::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Treat Mile 22 as a video game that you install and can barely begin to play due to technical bugs and issues. You uninstall and attempt to get your money back (and can if you bought it on Steam).::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::As an action movie fan, with some of my favorites coming from the 80's and 90's, I always like when there's a new action or cop movie out on the block. I find that today there simply are not enough of them or if they do exist, they are B or C grade direct to consumer releases.::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Mile 22 is disjointed from the word GO. It suffers from awful dialogue, jumpy scenes, jittery camera angles, and that the tell-tale sign of any bad action movie made since the year 2001: chopped up action scenes.::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Just watch the first 20 minutes, where Mark Wahlberg is busy talking to some lady in what I believe is a police compound. The camera leaps around from facial shot to facial shot, pans around the back of a characters head, angles itself sideways against a wall, proceeds to show you the back-quarter of a talking woman's head ... and ... why??? If two characters are talking/having a conversation, do I, the viewer, need to be transported in 1000 different visual directions? No. This is armature film making at its finest. It is the crap we've been handed for nearly two decades now.::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Why do I keep putting the same sentence in this review?::camera flashes to Mark Wahlberg snapping a bracelet against his wrist::Because that is what this movie does to you as a viewer.

431,WarRiderOfRuin,Not quite there,6,17 November 2020,"Overall this was a relatively entertaining action movie, but it didn't really grab me. It had a fairly simple extraction plot that moves it along without carrying any real emotional investment or weight. The acting was all fine, including Mark Wahlberg. Some people may not like the writing on his hyperactive character, but he portrayed it well. Iko Uwais continues to have gradual improvement on his acting, but he is always excellent in fight scenes. This is where the movies biggest failure comes in. The framing and cuts on the gunfights are okay, but the hand to hand scenes are awful. The director or editor clearly had no idea how to showcase Uwais' ability and it definitely dropped a star off the movie for me. I don't feel like I wasted my time watching this, but I don't see myself coming back for another viewing.",Mile 22

The characters get little development but allusions (often minor) add flesh to their bones, saving them from 2-dimensionality.As the plot progresses the stakes continually grow with the viewers desire for a satisfying conclusions to the various threads of the story.The characters, the plot and the fate of the secretive government body (Overwatch) all nicely set up the prospect of a gritty sequel.Solid performances are delivered by Wahlberg, Uwais and Malkovich, but it's Lauren Cohen who really gets to show her acting chops.",Mile 22

You are making the huddled masses dumber.

However, the action very hard to see due to the filming style. The camera is very shaky and the scenes are not well lit so it looks like a head jarring earthquake the whole time.Furthermore, Wahlberg is past his prime.

And this movie has successfully shown it. With the recent advent of mass shootings in the US, and it seemed despite the advances of USA's intelligence agency and security this movie can easily show how difficult it is to maintain safety of the public.No. This movie will not give you the fake drama of the dangers that the military faces everyday because this movie will literally show you an ""in your face"" account of how ordinary an end of the world situation can simply occur.No music, no warning and then boom your dead! That's the reality.It can be confusing at first watched because that's how espionage works. The safety of the public can be tangled in the confusing prelude of politics before anyone realizes how the hell did those lapses in security occured. And it was realistically portrayed here.And finally, one will realize that these things can happen simply because of one person's personal vendetta.And history has shown us that time and time again.So, to the critics, eat shit for making me nearly miss this GEM OF A MOVIE because of drama-driven and Hollywood biased criticisms.Lastly, to the viewers, watch it twice if you got confused the first time. The second time's a charm.Carefully read Silva's description and you will understand why he is like that.Amazing twist and one hell of a movie!",Mile 22

Whereas in the Accountant, we find our hero is a super savant with a healthy side of Asperger's thrown in for good measure gives a good excuse for limited dialogue. Sometimes limited dialogue is a good thing & in the Accoutant, it works. The strong silent type always worked for Clint in his movies.In MIle 22 Mark Wahlberg's character is not the strong silent type but instead a si[er secret agent with tourettes. The dialogue he is given to work with makes his character not very likeable. And its very awkward dialogue that is too long at times for its own good.

Right up until he lets the ""bad guys"" win and gets everyone killed. By that point he's only being smug... which he doesn't need to pretend for.You'll also like the low fps shakey-cam and .05 second consecutive cut editing every time anything moves, and usually even when it doesn't. Despite all this awesomeness I am saddened to report that the guy from The Raid films and a couple of entertaining kill ideas were sacrificed in the making of the ""bergs"" latest outing.So in closing, go watch The Raid and its sequel for some cool fighting, go watch Sesame Street for accurate up to date intelligence community shenanigans... or watch Very Bad Things, ironically, the least bad thing a ""berg"" has ever been around.

All the bad guys are from the 80s with that bad aiming in gun battles, have no idea about cover but are very considerate to let the good guys exit a car and walk into an apartment building without shooting them. They only start firing back when they are fired at by some poor dude who was tied to the back of a car after he was blown up in a cafe, so at least they were following the rules of engagement. That poor dude at the car took so many rounds and still took down bad guys, what a hero. Also if a member of their top secret super spy special force team is injured, they're given a grenade to help them on their way (or tied to the back of a car), so the camaraderie in their group is a bit lacking.

For me, the end itself was pretty unusual for a typical US intelligence 'I am everywhere' type movie which was pretty good for a change. The music, action, fights were all well adapted and delivered. The only hiccup in the greatness of this movie was the annoying and unnecessary character of Mark Wahlberg. The movie starts by spending a good 2 minutes to develop an image of 'Jimmy Silva', which makes you think that the guy's a god or something. With high expectations from the character in the start, the movie unfolds to be disappointing when you find out that his only strength is to bully people with no respect for their rank or profession.Honestly, I enjoyed the movie because 20 minutes in, I had decided to ignore the character of Jimmy Silva and chose to be amused by the action bit which turned out to be rewarding.

The story is flimsy and full of holes. but the worst part is the childish script. Mark Whalberg is always being fed straight lines from the others in the cast so that he has con reply with a witty response. Sadly, the set up is obvious and the punch lines or one liners are hopeless.
The other sad part of this story is that it is another beat up on Russia. Less serious that Red Sparrow but more childish propaganda which is becoming tiresome from the film industry.
Avoid at all costs.",Mile 22

Really nothing wrong with acting. Everyone did a good job with the material and there were some suprising funny lines. Malkovich bipolar comment about Walberg's character was perfectly delivered. This is a good action film that doesn't have indestructible heros, which effectively builds tension. I was never board and it delivered a nice 90 minutes of escapist entertainment.",Mile 22

Seriously, if he had just kept his mouth shut for 75% of the movie, and the director hadn't been so dead set on darting back and forth every 2 seconds between different ""suspenseful"" scenes, it might have actually been a decent, albeit predictable action movie.",Mile 22

499,glennabello-01524,Action for Action's Sake!,6,20 November 2020,"I gave this film a ""6"" only because I like Mark Wahlberg and most of the work in which he preforms. This adventure into the shoot'em up world had several plus points...1) it was brief (about 95 minutes), 2) it had plenty of action (explosions, knifings, bullets, etc.) and 3) Ronda Rousey gets blown to smithereens in a street fight rather than actually getting beaten bloody in the ring. This was obviously a new adventure for her, as her spoken lines were short and trivial, but, hopefully, it's a start for a less hazardous career.The film, other than the seemingly non-stop violence, was quite thin in its content, but would certainly hold the interest of the younger set (i.e., no thought required). There was little character development, especially with the soap opera drama of Lauren Cohan, who was trying to be an effective combat team member while stressing over her private life.The rubber band snapping and the finger touching by the main characters were somewhat annoying, although all of the Roosky cast members were also touching their fingers in the same way as their triple agent, Iko Iwais, was doing.

It is something else, as there are no subplots despite the thing with Alice, and it only concentrates on the work of the agents, pointing out that they give their lives for it every day.

This film has absolutely zero elements to it outside of its action. And yet, the action itself wasn't executed very well either. The action sequences barely even qualify for ""shaky-cam"" filming with how quick cut it is. Apparently the chaos alone is supposed to be appealing to the viewer because we certainly can't actually see what's going on.As for the characters, wahlberg is certainly one of the best for this role, but the script renders his character barely likable. Lauren Cohen's character is quite likeable, but the lack of any character development whatsoever hurts any chance of connection. As a result of the inability to connect with a single character, it's pretty hard to even care about what happens in the end.Love wahlberg in this role.

Will I watch again?Absolutely. I always watch movies again which I like.Mark Wahlberg is an actor who brings action into his movies, which is to be expected. He actually does a good job at delivering. Lots of energy with a fast pace story. The cast was spot on. Now a some wanted to see Ronda Rousey have a stronger part, but unfortunately she is not a polished actor. The part she had was right up her alley, good job. As for her getting bigger parts I am sure she is attempting to hone those skills of an actor like she did fighting.

Not bad, not Oscar-worthy, but worth my time. This movie would have gotten to at least a nine from me if it had not been for the WAY over the top performance of Wahlberg's character. I assume that he was performing the way he was directed, or at least I hope that was the case. After awhile I wanted to yell SHUT UP AND SLOW DOWN because he was getting to be a bit too much for me.I understand the premise of the character and his anger problems but that's not really the issue. After seeing what happened to the character in the opening scenes, I understood where he was coming from. On a 1 to 10 scale, I'd say the character was about a 9.5 on the 'heart-attack-is-imminent' scale. If he'd have come across as a 6 or a 7, I'd have been much more into the movie.",Mile 22

His tactical role could have been replaced with any grunt fresh out of infantry school.
Lauren Cohan's character was an overly emotional mess who had no business being on this ""elite"" team. Like Mark, her character just came off as annoying and the epitome of the debate against women in combat.
Iko Uwais was the cool and quiet guy but that simply couldn't hold this movie together. His fight scenes would have been awesome if the cameraman wasn't stumbling and falling over while filming every action scene to the point you can't even see what's happening.

Even most of the cgi was poorly done.All in all: A movie that promises a lot, but provides nothing. I only hope that Wahlberg and Co made a lot on this so that they can focus on A list stuff.

We are certainly all in agreement that it's not close to Oscar material , but for entertainment value , its definetly worthy of at least a 7 or 8 . For christ sake it's an action movie ,..its not pretending to be anything more . What's crazy is the ratings on this movie are split right down the middle ,....kinda like our country as of late.
Anyways , good flick , fast moving , acting is what it is but the action scenes and fight scenes have a couple of interesting new combat techniques thrown in for good measure and the plot , albeit ""used up "" still works .

There's no character development and no plot (unless you count the last 5 minutes where they squeeze in as much explanation for what you just watched as they can). The characters were all over-the-top, which with a poor script, just came off as awkward and cheesy. The only reason this even got a 4 was Iko Uwais. His fight scenes were the only notable part of the movie, all the other action sequences were overly-edited and incoherent. Even the dialogue scenes were far too heavily edited and felt extremely choppy.If anything, I would've preferred following Iko Uwais' character and discovering how and why he was in that situation instead of just seeing Mark Wahlberg be a dick to people.Not a bad, albeit unoriginal, idea, just poorly executed.",Mile 22

The reviews were mixed, although when is that actually not the case, but I decided to watch it on the basis that some reviews suggested it was a decent, fast moving, action film, and the Mark Whalberg films I have seen I have enjoyed. Well seeing it was a mistake and I got very close to walking out before the end. I do think there was a good action film there but they failed to make it.The biggest downer for me was the cinematography and editing which I thought was pretty poor. Much of the film is filmed in close-up and there is a lot of fast cutting. So when you have a single person on screen all you get is a far too close close-up of their head. And for action scenes you completely lose the whole effect of the scene in a blur fast cut close up images. The film contains there are a couple of what look to be good fight scenes, but you cannot tell because you cannot really see what is happening. This was a real shame because Iko Uwaimdbis can obviously do this kind of fight scene as he did in The Raid.The other downer of this film is that I just did not care about the characters. I just did not engage with Whalberg's character or his team, or they did not engage with me, and so I did not care whether they achieved their objective not.Any good points? Well I thought the story was overall a good one, with a nice twist, and the film is fast moving, but not being able to appreciate the action, and not liking the characters meant that none of that mattered.I did not enjoy the film and so unfortunately cannot recommend it.",Mile 22

The others you don't quite get their storyline except (the divorce mother).The star of the movie is the Iko Uwais character, whose fight scenes definitely had too many fast changing angles.

Oh we should have family drama, let's throw in an angry divorced mom and some random app for no reason. Americans enjoy swearing, so throw some darts at random curse words and pepper them into the dialogue even if it doesn't make sense and just sounds cringey. You guys ever see Seven? Yeah, let's throw in a plot twist at the end. We want to make our money back in the Asian territories, so let's not even say what country this is but make sure the Russians are the bad guys (or are they?).

Don't believe the naysayers -- Mile 22 has the best action scenes you will see this year. I just saw it today in the theater, and I can't wait to go back and see it again. Their ingredients to construct this movie: take the best ideas and action from the Jason Bourne series, ""Salt"" with Angelina Jolie, and ""The Accountant"" with Ben Affleck; add in original plot developments and awesome counterespionage technology; make Jason Bourne the leader of an elite Special Ops team (instead of acting on his own); then give each of the Special Ops team members two bottles of nitroglycerin to throw at their discretion at a time when they want to give the movie an explosive action scene or a plot twist, and you have 'Mile 22'. Mark Wahlberg brings the intense plotting intelligence and decisive action that he showed in 'Contraband', but here with increased requirements to react fast to enemies' intercepting actions. Iko Uwais, Lauren Cohan, and Ronda Rousey are all impressive -- if anything, I think they could have increased Ronda's role substantially, given her athleticism and intensity.

600,priyamtheone,Just a conventional military action movie.,5,27 August 2018,"This is a regular movie depicting the happenings of the American defence system and the politics manipulating them. But I doubt if this is a movie on covert ops, because barring the mission in the opening scene, no incident was significant enough to be regarded as covert op. Most of the job done by Silva's team could've been executed by a military unit. There's no need for an exclusive covert team for that. Trying to assassinate Noor right in an American establishment is utterly unacceptable. No one would dare to do that. Mass explosions in public places were passable, but a cat & mouse chase with vehicles and random shootouts in broad daylight centring around a covert op is absurd. However, I liked the characters of Alice and Sam. Despite of part of a high intensity operation team, they try to take time to associate themselves with their families. They shed blood & sweat exceptionally, and sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Regardless of being women, they are equally on par with men. As part of a defence team, Mark Wahlberg was better in 
Lone Survivor. The only enthralling part was that of Noor himself and the Russian angle behind him. Noor's imposing stoicism and how the Russians played on him nailed the whole thing. The Americans, being manipulative every time and everywhere as they think they are the best, didn't see it coming this time. I must say, I liked the Russians more than the Americans. Overall, you'll definitely enjoy the movie if you watch it as a conventional military action film and not as a covert op one. However, the ending left with a scope for a good sequel, which the makers have already declared of planning too. But the sequel must come up based on a strong, intense and rational plot.

627,vinavinaruerue,Criticism are misleading!!,8,27 August 2018,"I understand the criticisms about this movie. But the criticisms fail to consider the movie as a whole and only consider minor things. It is very difficult with respect to me to like a movie, yet I liked this one! I will mention the pros and cons and let the reader decides. I will start with the cons to explain why this movie doesn't get a high rating despite it deserves a lot more.Cons (as mentioned by criticisms):1) Camera shaking. It is not perfect but not too bad. It doesn't prevent you from enjoying the movie.2) Fast dialog. This is an action movie - not a drama. More dialog will make it boring.3) Story. This a personal opinion. I personally like the story.Now, why I would give such a movie 8 stars although I am very difficult to be satisfied by any movie.Pros:1) In most cases, in action movies, the good guy (hero) starts weak and suddenly becomes unbeatable at the end. Or sometimes the hero is already unbeatable from the beginning to the end. In this movie, we have a fair war. The good guys (heroes) lose and lose and lose from the beginning to the end. The bad guys are tough and really tough, and many times in the movie you wonder ""how are they going to make it!?"".2) This movie is very fast. Everything is fast. You will never get bored. No unnecessary lengthy dialog. It is full from the beginning to the end unlike other movies where the director just pass minutes by unnecessary lengthy dialog and scenes.3) The twist. Although you may predict the end, but it is really satisfying connecting all the parts of the movie into a single picture.I write this review because I think this movie got a lot less than what it deserves.This is an action movie that is fast, straight without any derailing. Good and bad guys are almost equal - Fair war- this creates a lot of thrill. Actions scenes are good and thrilling. The story is also good with a very satisfying end.Don't listen to criticisms. I strongly recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed.",Mile 22

This is exactly what action movies are: turn of your brain and watch people get mowed down and crap getting blown up. That's all an action movies is. If you go into every action movie expecting an Oscar winner then your watching the wrong kind of movies. Action movies have always been over the top, filled with bad actors (sometimes), and usually not much of a story. But it doesn't matter, it's an ACTION movie, if they're worth anything, then they at least have a decent amount of said ""action"".

The misery wasn't sadness/pain related. It was pure, unparalleled confusion.I wanted my brain to cease functioning so I could stop trying to make sense of this film.My advice: don't watch it.

But I went in with as open a mind as I could.
Iko was awesome. There was not remotely enough of him in the film. He stole every scene with him in (he's lethal handcuffed to a bed!) to the point you feel he wasn't in it more simply as everyone else suffered by comparison.
Nearly everything else about the film was dreadful- there's an incorehant 'usual suspects' flashback style set of weird patriotic segments, characters die in a predictable by the numbers format and when it finally attempts something brave, you're just left feeling it didn't put the work in early on for it to make sense.

Story line could have been better. Dialogue could have been better. A lot of talents within the movies but not all of them are used to the max.

I simply don't understand the haters.
Actually, I'm wondering who do they hate more, Wahlberg or Malkovich? Because there's no other reasonable explanation.
The actors play very well, the pace is sustained. The plot is not unique nor mind blowing, and we've seen similar parts many times before. But is engaging from start to end.
And the plot is never revealed, at any point, so you're motivated to watch throughout the movie. Plenty of twists and turns, but not to the point of loosing track of what's happening.
Some may not consider watching it in the cinema, but plenty others would.
I even liked the subtle reference to Catch 22.
All in all, a good movie. Stop spreading the hate, people, it's demeaning... It's not Oscar material, but it's definitely worth watching.

The idea of the movie was ridiculous and so was the main star ( not Iko) Mark.
Mark had such a loud mouth throughout the movie like someone who had just quit smoking. I mean he was talking and yelling so much that even the female stars looked truly annoyed by his character. The poster and the trailer makes Mark look like a real tough bad ass special forces or something... But all you get from him is his spit from talking too much. He doesn't fight anyone, gets his ass beat up by a couple of female villains, only to get saved by Iko. And he gets a few headshots which look dumb and lucky. 
Iko was good for what it's worth, as his fight scenes are just messed up by the shaky camera and the quick cut scenes. 
I had high expectations... But got highly disappointed. I wanted to leave half way. 
I gave this movie 3 stars, and only because of Iko. As he was good and had no part in this mess. This was strictly a Hollywood pasticcio..with Mark and Berg leading the way.

the writing/script is awful. Many character isn't convincing or wasted. The only character that is deep enough is only iko.bad angle and shaky cam. bad editing, really disrupt the flow of fights and story.So, if you are following iko's film like the raid, merantau etc, you'll be disappointing with this movie.

And even then, the last bit of twist also add to the interesting part.Story building though, are just so-so. Well... Most of action packed movies are like this to be honest.

At times it appeared as if they had intended for Tarantino to direct it though, especially in regards to the delivery of many of the lines. From a movie like this, you expect gratuitous violence, but the dialogs were cheesy on occasion. Having worked with some special forces operators in the past, one of their archetypes is someone who takes themselves way too seriously, as mark's character does.The pacing of the movie was so fast it lent itself to a second viewing, which was more enjoyable than the first. I think this film may have had more success if it was 20 minutes longer or so, to space out the cheesy parts of the script.

His specialties - zeal, and running his mouth.Initially our heroes take out a sacrificial(?) Russkie safe house in an unnamed U.S. suburb. From it they harvest a coded hard drive alleged to detail pending chemical attacks on the West. One of the terrorists killed during the grab is the son of a high-ranking FSB Director. Save this info for later.This and all other operations in the film are overseen by John Malkovich, always a mere video link away. He runs the show from some nameless conference room in the U.S. with (as we shall see later) no security detail whatsoever.Give me more John Malkovich, please.Enter good guy (?) Li Noor and a cinematographic hoax. An apparent double agent, he is initially shown in Jakarta burning his ID and a photo of wife and child as a prequel to his pending role in the film.It turns out the suburban grab was based on a tip from secret police operative Li. Our co-star claims, ""I had a good feeling about him.""If Jimmy was as smart as the script makes him out to be, the plot to decode the hard drive, extract Li from Jakarta, and save the world should have ended during the second reel.

Sorry I will not continue to introduce the other cast, sorry for that, they are very good regardless.
This movie has nice action scenes, and even though the time line jumps back and forth in the narrative and is sometimes a bit unnecessary, the thing that made me write this in the first place is:
in the end the whole narrative is based in a premise that makes no sense.
(Spoilers now) Li Noor is set as a triple agent to avenge the son of a very powerful woman, that was killed in a mission that the info was wrong about.

The action is predictable and the acting is an insult to the viewer.
Most of the characters are so shallow that it gets comical. A few scenes show something that resembles personal quirks which is obviously an attempt to fix the shallow characters. However this is done in such a clumsy way that I almost felt sorry for the film crew.
There are a few adrenaline inspiring martial arts scenes. If staring on a canvas covered with blurred hasty movements, a few splashes of red tint here and there with random yelling and sounds of bursting glass panes is what you're into, this might be your medicine.

Mark Wahlberg plays a super dedicated, grossly over-the-top special ops type guy who is just constantly going on rants to give intensity to the movie but it just comes off as weird, unnecessary, and confusing. Lauren Cohan is the most frustrated divorced mother ever. Finally, they cast Ronda Roussey only to give her ZERO fight scenes and barely any lines....great.The star of the movie is the Iko Uwais character, with amazing fight scenes with perhaps too many fast changing angles so you cannot exactly follow what's happening.

758,korpilaakso,"My first review, this one needed it!",8,6 February 2019,"So the first one, why? Why for a movie that crashed and burned with the critics and wasn't a hit at the box office? Well maybe because I think this movie got a beating it didn't deserve.I guess critics expected something similar, in standard, of Lone Survivor, Patriot's Day and maybe even Deepwater Horizon. And why not, this is from Berg and Wahlberg? Thing is, this isn't based on actual events. Actual events is Berg's strong suit and maybe this one should've been expected just as an entertainment piece.I've read about the shaky cam action in this to death. That's a bit of an overstatement. It ain't that bad. One darkish scene is the only one where I noticed some confusion of who is hitting who. That's it, that really is it.Also Wahlberg's character and his acting has been getting a lot of criticism. Actually if you follow Marky Mark's acting in his career, this role has his style but also at times he does something different and I think Mark lights the screen in this one. Some others not so much. Found myself asking why is that character doing that constantlyEditing is fast but not bad. The ""money shots"" are clear as crystal and almost every time works and pumps you up.Storytelling, at first, is a bit confusing. But once you work it out it's actually engaging.The only thing is that the movie delivers nothing new. But everything it does it does with huge confidence and good craftsmanship.I anticipated this movie like crazy, then the reviews hit and got to me and I thought that I'll give it a watch sometime with zero expectations. Now that I've seen it. I was surprised how overlooked and under appreciated this one was.A very good watch. Maybe I'm a bit biased because I'm a huge Marky Mark fan",Mile 22

Its that kind of CIA operation real life activities with a very close view to the intelligence field inside and out the USA. Other thing should be mentioned that there are some intelligence procedures which is hard for the civilians to understand due to not having experience with how those people in this field do their work. So some people can think its a very fast movie for just intelligence operation.

The back and forth dialog was a bit forced but it worked well and walberg played someone that he does not normally play(mr cool guy.) He was rattled and unhinged and if you can look past the fact that most governments would keep this character away from guns and not make him the leader of anything.

The characters are interesting too. Not your usual cookie cutter, two dimensional American heroes, but rugged, flawed humans. The only justification for such wildly negative reviews from the likes of the Guardian (1 star?!) and Empire (2 stars) is that it's rampant machismo offended the reviewers in some way. Either that or there's something more unsettling going on. Something to do with western studios wanting to maintain their monopoly by stamping out the threat of burgeoning Eastern studios perhaps?

Also the technology involved and how they communicates with their base and the people who have compromised their data stream are extremely realistic.I would definitely recommend this film to people that like fast paced, suspense, nail biting, action packed and high tech elements.I see that there are a lots of reviews talking about how Mark W, keeps shouting throughout the entire film. I don't want to give anything away or spoil the film by going into detail however I must say that all the reviews saying how Mark W keeps shouting like an idiot throughout the film is a load of crap.

808,edwardnelsonnj,C'mon people it's not that bad,6,3 September 2018,"First of all, full disclaimer, as a child of the 80s I love to see an R rated, mid budget, action film creep it's way into theaters. Long ago before redbox and VOD you could see a Michael Duddikoff American Ninja film in theaters. You could see a studio try to convince you that Jeff Speakman was going to be a star. Christ, dont forget that till about 99 both Seagal and Van Damme were able to get released into theaters. This is the lens through which I viewed Mile 22.
 The film follows an elite CIA unit led by a spectrumy Jimmy Silva, played by Marky Mark, as they try and get an ""asset"" with information about an impending attack 22 miles to a waiting plane. That's really it. Is there an attempt to fill in backstory? I guess. Does it matter? Not really. 
 Once it gets going, it's a breezy solid, 70 or so minutes of action. That's it. No body cared about backstory of Arnold's team in predator. You just knew they were badasses. Same here. Maybe this sort of movie is an 80s dinosaur, but I didnt hate it. I enjoyed it. Really my only complaints are the way they filmed Iko Uwais fight scenes(too many cuts), and some dangling plot threads a sequel we will probably never see was supposed to answer. The film has a couple twists you may guess, but don't think it ruins film. I had no problem dropping my money for it on a $5 Tuesday. If you like action films, go see it, or wait till VOD or redbox. I would have paid to see a sequel, but everyone is too woke now for this type of film and it's why we can't have nice things anymore.",Mile 22

character development is messed up. James Silva (Mark Wahlberg) supposed to be a highly intelligent people, yet we just saw him yelling and being angry all the time. many cast member only had few forgettable lines, we cant even remembered they was there. Do you know CL from korean girl group 2NE1 was in the movie?
and finally, the biggest reason this movie is so disappointed. without doubt, the biggest star in this movie is Iko Uwais (Li Noor), he is best known for starring in The Raid . there are lot of action movie fans who watch this movie just to see Iko Uwais. even tho i know his acting is still awkward, but when talking about his stunt in fighting scenes he always do a great job, especially when he do a hand-to-hand combat while filming with steadicam shot, like in The Raid, which make the action scene look so intense and awesome. yet this movie used annoying fast changing angles shot on iko's fight scene, which makes Iko's stunt look nothing but decent fight scene",Mile 22

Iko Uwais is phenomenal as always in his fight scenes. Those are the only redeeming qualities on the movie. If you pay attention to the movies opening credits after the FSB raid, you can tell that the only survivor is going to be Mark Wahlberg's character James Silva. Ronda Rousey's character is compelled underutilized even though this was her chance to actually ""act"" and not just fight like in the past movies she's been in. Mark Wahlberg's character can be funny sometimes and curses like a sailor and talks fast (I like it; has a charm to it). The movie does make you care about the characters, so when it's their final time you feel a bit sad. The plot gets convoluted when it goes further in but the twist at the end is shocking where you see how it connects to the beginning. What really sucks for me about the movie is that it does not go full in-depth to Mark and Lauren's other teammates on Overwatch. You still feel sad about their deaths but you would feel a much better impact if you knew their whole story. Iko's character has no depth whatsoever, he's just there to further the plot and make the ending shocking. All in all, I thought the movie was good due to the action, but I think it should've been longer. It was too short to really stand out and create more depth to the movie and it's plot. It seemed rushed and there are instances in the action where your can't follow what is happening in that moment. It is not Berg and Mark's best collaboration together.

Very action-packed and bloody/gory With lots of bone crunching involved. If you love those types of movies you will enjoy this movie. I was fine with it up until the end. Not something I would go watch again but definitely not something that was crap. My issue however comes because I like things to make sense logically. So it was at the end that Threw me off. It took me the drive home to figure out what set me off. Here's where the spoiler comes in: The double agent in fact turns into a triple agent for Russia. In essence killing everybody involved. I can live with this the only issue I have is that at the beginning of the movie that when they initially made that first bust it was because of the information this supposed double agent gave one of their agents. The feeling I got from the show was that because the secret agency went in and killed a bunch of Russians one of them being a rich ladies kid, the rich lady then hired this double agent to go in and kill the American agency. It still doesn't make sense because this double agent was the one that told them where to go to kill the Russians. Which means the kid shouldn't have died because the cop Was not hired until after the kid was killed.No way did the rich Russian woman have it all planned out and said hey you should go and kill my son. So maybe it's possible to think of some alternative reasons. They could be... A mark Wahlberg's character had a psychotic break down and either he went rogue or decided to kill everybody. Or the second situation is that another government hired the Triple agent to create all this chaos so that they could go in and kill this American agency.

The few seconds she is in the film are heart-rendering and stunning. She's a natural on the camera, and her alluring charisma and presence brightened the screen instantly. It was a grave error not to utilize her talents more. Mile 22 should be screened in film schools as an example of how NOT to make an action film.

The pros and cons are detailed to a point I have no need to explain them. I will however go into depth with my experience with the film and why I loved it enough to want the sequel and rate this a solid 8.First, I did not give this a 10 because of flaws I really hate in action films where the action scenes are choppy and you can't fully enjoy them. In fact I was more confused during action scenes than anything else. I with many have found most action films to be the exact same unbeatable hero from the get-go, or loser to hero. Leaving them predictable and not very entertaining or memorable in the end. Just throw those into the mix of time wasted movies because they're all forgotten replicas. In this we have the latter option of a balanced character vs the bad guys.
Most beg for something different, more entertainment, then complain that the prequel doesn't complete the story. Like in this film where the character development has not been completed because this is an obvious story written for us to continue wanting more of the story.With so many loose ends, and an obvious cliffhanger, people are complaining that they have gotten what they asked for. A story that doesn't drag out as a run of the mill hollywood film like the Fast & Furious series turned into.You have characters, characters that are awesome with great actors (props to Rousey, no idea she could act beyond WWE). On top of that you have plausible action sequences with some beyond plausible scenarios. You got badass fighting, shooting, sarcasm and a badass way of using anger to develop characters. I loved it all the way through with this becoming a sequel or even a fantastic trilogy, I cannot wait to find out what happens in the next game our newly found action character will have to go through.
I really hope they do not narrow out the plot or kill the cynicism for everyone crying that it's not basic enough.This is a movie with a story to tell. Not a book to have another basic story to tell. Leave that to the blockbuster films of Hollywood.Gives us real quality like this !",Mile 22
876,genredoe,A Bitter Pill to Swallow,8,4 November 2018,"This movie goes against the grain of the sacred ""Mission First"" protocol.
It took me awhile to figure out why this movie is so controversial with all the low ratings.
I slept on the problem and determined that this movie shows a major case of tunnel vision leading to serious loss.
Sometimes it is possible to win the battle and lose the war.
I suspect this movie might be a case of why the United States can not win in Afghanistan and hits a little too close to home for some people.
This movie could be a case study on the failure in the intelligence community but I believe some will just try to chuck it in the wood-bin of history.
A fair criticism of this movie though is that it is not totally realistic as ""Mother"" would be in a well guarded SCIF.
This movie also silently calls into question as to what is the real point in why we are losing lives on the battlefield.

The story was muddled and in places confusing and unnecessary, such as random scenes that dealt with an absent mother who was more intent on fulfilling her role as a spec ops operative.
The fight scenes were hard to follow with numerous camera angles and the story was, to be honest, very lame.
To say it was disappointing is perhaps an understatement as I was looking forward to watching this.

This movie seem like a reality, it's a fair movie, at the ending it was predictable fine but that was when it was too late and at that moment they can never do anything to change what has happened, that's real life as well, they come times when we make mistake and that moment it seems so impossible to correct it but what matters is the numbers of times you stand up saying if I don't win this fight I won't give up.

But when you mash all three together with a barely coherent plot, it works about as well as pizza and ice cream smoothies.Mark Walhberg reprises his tough guy action hero again. In the past, he's pulled it off, mostly because of a believable story and good supporting cast. In this train wreck, he just keeps the plot moving grudgingly along. Jim Silva is the apparent head of an elite covert paramilitary team. They are part of the Overwatch, who operate above the government and military (the unseen good guys). The movie opens with his team hitting a suspected Russian safe house that somehow has a hidden room with no apparent way to get in or out. The mission goes sideways, there's a shoot out and all the Russians are killed.Fast forward a year and the team finds itself in a South East Asian county indo-whatever. A Jet Li type defector is taken into custody with an encrypted drive that will self destruct in several hours of he is not given asylum. Cue the dramatic music, Overwatch is activated.While this is going on, an experimental Russian surveillance plane is flying somewhere in Eurasia and magically has cracked the Overwatch teams encrypted communication and is listening to their every conversation. Just to add a plot device, they switch frequencies which now allows the Russians to triangulate on the encrypted signal.Silva's team runs a never ending gauntlet of bad guys as he tries to drive 22 miles to the airport to deliver the defector. The whole time, it never dawns on anyone in the team of command center that something might be amiss. No matter what street the team takes, or what safe house they hide in, the bad guys in black motorcycle helmets always finds them! At no time does anyone think their ""secure"" comms have been compromised, so they just plod methodically along from gun fight to gun fight.The climax of the movie is just as confusing as the rest of the plot, as it turns out to all be an elaborate plot to avenge the death of the son of a Russian general.
