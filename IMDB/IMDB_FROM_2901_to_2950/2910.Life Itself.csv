0,SnoopyStyle,tired of the tricks,2,3 September 2019,"Will Dempsey (Oscar Isaac) is a bitter struggling writer in NYC. In flashbacks, he is happily in love with Abby (Olivia Wilde). Dr. Cait Morris (Annette Bening) is his appointed therapist. Abby left him six months earlier and he's been institutionalized for three of those months. That's part one.The Samuel L. Jackson sarcastic narration is off-putting and throws me right off this movie from the very start. A pathetic Will does not help. It also doesn't help that a therapist's office is such a static setting for sitting people to talk about the story rather than showing the story. His neediness is tiring. There is a meandering aimlessness to the movie that is equally tiring. It took me a dozen stops and starts to get through the first thirty minutes. That's right. I could take this only two minutes at a time. Even the surrealism is tiring. Abby even states that the unreliable narrator is a gimmick, a trick. Tricks can be tiring but talking about the tricks being shown on screen is the most tiring of all. The distancing of story telling is tiring. I don't always mind narrative tricks but I don't want to pontificate on narrative tricks like a college thesis. There is nothing to care about. It is a well-made film aiming to frustrate me to no ends.That's the end of part one. Just when it gets slightly better if only for getting rid of the narrative conceit, the story starts all over with a new family and its own narrative choice, and I don't care. The heavy-handed writing is most of the problem. I wonder if the movie does the same stories without the tricks.",Life Itself
1,oscaralbert,The ladies in front of me asked if I thought that this 15-hankie flick . . .,10,29 September 2018,". . . was too weepy for male viewers, and before the closing credits finished rolling I replied that this would depend upon whether or not their guys were in total denial of LIFE ITSELF, like ""Old Scratch's"" large ""base"" of ""core supporters."" LIFE ITSELF is set in a world where being ""eviscerated"" by a city transit bus is considered to be about the worst thing that can happen to a lady. That is why LIFE ITSELF merits a top rating of ""10."" LIFE ITSELF harkens back to more innocent times, when a diagnosis of cancer did NOT automatically disqualify people from having a roof over their heads due to this ""pre-existing condition"" nullifying the security they had relied upon from their health insurance policy. The men of LIFE ITSELF have not yet declared ""Open Season on All Women,"" and the one young 15-year-old girl being molested feels free to shoot her assailant, without worrying that he will be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court some day. Though the story line of LIFE ITSELF extends well beyond Present Day America, the ravages of the Pachyderm Party trampling down all Basic Women's Rights are nowhere to be seen. ""Shari"" feels no qualms about presenting the A-word as option #2 for her ""surprise"" pregnancy, because LIFE ITSELF is set in a galaxy far, far away from the HANDMAID'S TALE land in which we currently suffer.",Life Itself
2,ferguson-6,cross-contient ripple effect,7,21 September 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. The theory is that heavy dramas find it challenging to attract an audience during times when real life and newscasts are filled with daily downers. One need only tune in to the local news to see that we are in just such a ""downer"" period right now, and it would be difficult to argue that this latest from writer/director Dan Fogelman (""This is Us"") is anything but the weightiest of heavy dramas - with an emphasis on the preciousness of time and life. It's highly likely that this film will fall into the love it or hate it category. It's a sure bet that many critics will bash it as pretentious and overly melodramatic. It will be labeled a manipulative tear-jerker with outlandish coincidences. I won't debate the merits of that criticism, and instead will remind all that creative fictional storytelling can often seem fantastical and improbable, but that doesn't mean it can't also be entertaining, thought-provoking, and carry a worthwhile message. Because of the overlapping and intertwining stories, characters and timelines, filmmaker Fogelman breaks the film into 5 chapters. This should allow most viewers to keep track. Chapter 1 is entitled ""The Hero"" and features Samuel L Jackson as the unreliable narrator - a recurring theme throughout. It's also in this chapter that we meet Will and Abby. Will (Oscar Isaac) is an emotionally unstable man who has been in a mental institute for the 6 months since his wife Abby (Olivia Wilde) left him. He is despondent and attending required sessions with a therapist played by Annette Bening, and we get cutesy flashbacks to the Will and Abby courtship. See, Abby and Will are the kind of couple who see themselves as Tarantino characters, argue about the merits of Bob Dylan (poet or Chewbacca noises?), and come up with the worst dog name in cinematic history.Chapter 2 is where we meet Dylan Dempster, daughter of Will and Abby, and granddaughter of Mandy Patinkin and Jean Smart. She is named after the poet songwriter, not the Star Wars character. There is a cool effect that evolves Dylan's face from a child surrounded by death and tragedy to a just-turned-21 year old played by Olivia Cooke (THOROUGHBREDS), who also happens to front an atrocious punk rock band and flashes quite the temper. Chapter 3 shifts from New York City to Carmona, Spain where we are introduced to ""The Gonzalez Family"" of Javier (an outstanding Sergio Peris-Mencheta), his wife Isabel (another excellent performance from Laia Costa, VICTORIA), and Javier's boss Saccione (Antonio Banderas). Javier works Saccione's olive orchard, as he and Isabel start a family. Chapter 4 focuses on their son Rodrigo (Alex Monner) as he grows into a talented young man while his beloved mother suffers with a debilitating disease. Finally, in Chapter 5 we meet Elena Dempsey-Gonzalez (Lorenza Izzo) and the story comes full circle ... or all the dots are connected. Even the identity of the narrator who took Samuel L Jackson's place after Chapter 1 is revealed.Filmmaker Fogelman seems to be better suited as a writer (CRAZY STUPID LOVE) than as a director (DANNY COLLINS), and his script here is extraordinary in its ambition. While there may be some developments that seem contrived, there are also some terrific moments throughout. We see a cross-continent ripple effect that makes this the CRASH of family dramas (the 2004 movie, not the one from 1996). Who is a hero and who is a villain is one of the key elements here, but Fogelman seems intent on making the point that traumatic events and tragedy shape who we are as people. The message is that our ability to bounce back - to ""stand up"" after being knocked down, is really what defines the human experience. For those who keep an open mind, the emotional jolts provided here will likely resonate.",Life Itself
3,siderite,Crash volume 1000: A bit hit and miss,7,8 December 2018,"Once in a while someone watches Crash and says ""hey, that's a great idea: let me write a convoluted story about people who are connected to each other through their personal lives!"". And it might work, or it might feel derivative, or it may simply crash and burn (see what I did there?). Life Itself has some very good things going for it, like an amazing cast, a very strong start and an intriguing story. However, it then goes completely bust by killing off everyone and basically starting from scratch... in Spanish. I had the great opportunity to also not have any translation for that part and what I remembered from childhood proved woefully inadequate. Yet, I didn't need the translation (heh, you will see what I mean if you watch the film and get to the end) to understand that the characters in the first two ""chapters"" were way more interesting and sympathetic than the ones in the Spanish saga at the end. And while it droned on I thought to myself: ""where is this going?"" and the answer was so obvious that it made the ending stale and predictable.So yeah, bottom line is that this is a collection of four stories, if you want to think of it that way, and the first one is great, the second pretty good and the rest rubbish, their ""connection"" kind of irrelevant and the end moral of the story forced.",Life Itself
4,ThomasDrufke,"At Times Beautiful, others Painfully Manipulative",6,3 October 2018,"While some would say it's far too sappy and convoluted, I found some of Life Itself to be charming, even though it's admittedly manipulative in some frustrating ways. From the creator of This is Us (aka, the most manipulative show on television), Life Itself takes the same sort of massive cast & story premise, with a more grandiose approach. I would say about half of it lands and half of it really doesn't. It's certainly manipulative, and since I expected that going in, I disappointingly new exactly where a certain storyline was going, and sure enough that's right where it ended up. I didn't particularly mind any performance, but I really loved Mandy Patinkin, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, and Laia Costa's roles. Those were the 3 that resonated with me the most in the ensemble cast feature. And overall, I liked that the film was trying to say about ripple effects and how unknowingly, the world is changing every second with every subtle (or not) move every person is making. I like when movies comment on those broad ideas and such, but you can do it without being manipulative and shoving a certain idea in your face over and over again.6.0/10",Life Itself
5,westsideschl,Poor Flow,5,20 June 2019,"Another following of generations w/happenstance encounters w/unpredictable outcomes storyline. A few problems. First, acting was too acting like - not very real. Second, dragged on scenes that really didn't add much to the story, but sleepy viewer time. Third, lots of flashbacks to disrupt the flow & add confusion. Fourth, indicator of a cheap production in a lack of English subtitles for ESL, hard-of-hearing or deaf viewers. Fifth, not sure what the point was other than the last of the generations gets to tell us how fortunate she is.",Life Itself
6,dar0417,I liked it just not critics,7,14 February 2020,Solid romantic drama that you can kind of predict what was going to happen. Great acting for the most part but this film did not catch on at the box office.,Life Itself
7,peterp-450-298716,I know the critics say it's crap. I love a movie filled with emotions. Sue me. I'm an emotional guy.,8,13 March 2019,"So, what does that tell us?
That the only truly reliable narrator is life itself.
But life itself is also a completely unreliable narrator
because it is constantly misdirecting and misleading us and taking
us on this journey where it is literally impossible to predict where it's
gonna go next.Occasionally I come across such a film that knows how to surprise me. At first, I wondered what it was all about. Usually, I take a wait-and-see approach and see where it's going. If there's no improvement in terms of story and it remains quite uninteresting, I'll give up. Fortunately, this rarely happens. And certainly not in the case of ""Life itself"". As the film progressed, it became (at least for me) more fascinating. Before I knew it, I was looking at the credits with astonishment and I thought to myself: ""Wow, what the hell was this"". A film that succeeds in making me quiet and paralyzed. That's quite an achievement.In retrospect, I was somewhat surprised at the negative comments regarding this film. I do understand there are people who are allergic to tragedy, drama, and sadness in films. But the bursts of tirades being fired at this movie, are rather exaggerated in my opinion. Or is it my anarchist nature that is rebelling? Calling ""Life itself"" the ""Worst movie of the year"", is a bit shortsighted and slightly simplistic. I suppose those who did, only watched the crème de la crème of films that year. I dare to admit that I've seen much worse last year. Again it looks like a snowball effect after the appearing of some reviews of prominent film critics. And expressions such as ""semi-intellectual"", ""philosophical ramblings"" and ""overly melodramatic"" are copied excessively so that it resembles a we-against-them situation. Or is it an acute case of navel-gazing? Or are they all male critics who, just like Dan Fogelman said in an interview, hate films with emotions? Maybe a defense mechanism so nobody would say that their tough torso contains too many female hormones. Oh well. If you focus on the correctness of timelines and the correct layout of the different time sections only, you may lose sight of the larger picture.I am convinced that among those notorious critics, there are some who unknowingly believe in certain things that would fit perfectly into the context of this film. Isn't it so that people speak of a soul mate who exists somewhere on this planet? That there's this one special person somewhere who's a good fit for you? And isn't the term karma used all the time? Does coincidence exist? Or coincidentally not? And then the pinnacle of mysterious power that millions believe in. The divine power that watches over us and directs our lives. I bet some of those opinion writers have used these terms before? Or that they want to save their soul every week by solemnly entering a church somewhere? Well, not me. Am I too realistic? Too suspicious? Could be. But I believe that a combination of circumstances and destiny can form the basis of a story such as ""Life itself"".Without a doubt, the first chapter is the one with the most impact. A chapter full of confusion, psychological distress, and trauma. But also a chapter about eternal love. Finding that one specific person who fits you unconditionally. Will (Oscar Isaac) and Abby (Olivia Wilde) are such a couple. The living proof of the well-known saying about the pot and the lid. Until one day Abby leaves Will, and Will's life immediately becomes a mess. A ruin that needs to be restored with the help of a psychologist. It's a chapter in which the storyline wraps itself ingeniously around Will's past and present. With and without Abby. With and without the will to live. A chapter full of flashbacks. A chapter introduced by Samuel L. Jackson who represents the ""unreliable storyteller"". The subject of Abby's thesis. But at the same time, he plays a character from a script that Abby and Will wanted to write together. ""A husband and wife Tarantino"". That's why Samuel L. Jackson uses his ""Pulp Fiction"" intonation. And then there are some who claim that his contribution adds little to the story. well, you just have to want to see it, I guess.The chapter ends shockingly. A blow of a sledgehammer, as it were. And from then on the story begins to spread intercontinental. From the rebellious Dylan (Olivia ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" Cooke), the end result of the wonderful love between Abby and Will, whose life is dominated by death. To Spain, where the rich olive oil manufacturer Mr. Saccione (Antonio Banderas) tells his life story to one of his workers, Javier Gonzalez (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). And although these two different family trees initially have nothing in common with each other, the two storylines melt together in a bewildering manner. But you have to discover for yourself how it all gets connected.The only flaw I could think of is the predictability at a certain moment. At first, you don't have a clue what's going on. Once you've passed that point, you can already see where it's going. If I were a nitpicker, I would use this to criticize ""Life itself"" harshly. But the inventive story and the sometimes excellent acting of a group of well-known actors make this a side issue. Perhaps it all seems doom and gloom. As if real life only produces sorrow and misery. Where you experience one setback after the other. Everyone has bad periods in their lives and emotionally difficult experiences. But perhaps the message is also that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. I don't believe in coincidence or destiny. I don't believe in a heavenly power that determines our lives and sets out the route in our lives. But admit it. The way the story developed here could actually also occur in real life. Unfortunately, sometimes life is indeed an unreliable narrator.",Life Itself
8,questl-18592,Life Happens,6,6 February 2020,"This is a charming movie. Wonderful performances all around. It just lacked a sense of cohesion to the narrative, jumping all over time and space in a way that... I had a hard time keeping my attention on this. Charming as it is, it never drew me in enough to hook me on the story and really want to keep track of everything going on.So, despite how much I liked everyone in it, the fact that it couldn't keep me engaged really hurts it and unfortunately drops it down to just an above average movie, great for background noise because whenever you look up there will likely be something pleasant there, but it's not strong enough to command attention throughout.",Life Itself
9,jadepietro,Good Intentions Gone Wrong,4,28 December 2018,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Life Itself is messier than life itself.JIM'S REVIEW: Life Itself is a incomprehensible mess. The film tries to connect different narrative strands that spans generations but it ends up tying itself in knots to get across its uplifting message: Yes, life can be messy, but love will get us through all the pain. Now that you know this tidbit of wisdom, dear moviegoers, look elsewhere for your philosophy lesson.Written and directed by Dan Fogelman, the film is divided into chapters which follows doomed lovers, fathers, mothers, and children whose lives intertwine through the ages. Some episodes are more interesting, others become boring exercises of sentimentality. The film is non-linear storytelling at its confusing worst. Characters seem fascinated by peanut butter sandwiches, Bob Dylan, and walking into on-coming traffic. It's not my world, but whose to say that someone out there can't relate!Fortunately, the actors are better than the material. Providing yeoman support are Oscar Issac, Mandy Patinkin, Antonio Banderas, Laia Costa, Annette Bening, and Olivia Wilde, while some, like Jean Smart and Samuel L. Jackson, are wasted in their sketchy roles. All try valiantly to make their characters more than plot devices only there to advance the story. But the overall effect is a mawkish overwrought melodrama.The film's very own unreliable narrator to blame is director / screenwriter Dan , who doesn't have a grasp of reality as he strings along his stories introducing his odd quirky characters trapped in a gimmicky format. Mr. Fogelman does deliver some nice visual moments which compare and contrast the individual chapters fairly well, but his dialog always sounds scripted, never sounding genuine or remotely real.Life Itself disappoints...just like life can do to us unexpectedly. It's all good intentions gone wrong. So, if you choose to see this movie, don't be surprised...You were warned.",Life Itself
10,rgkarim,What Does Life Hold?,6,21 September 2018,"This Is Us, a drama that brought an interconnected story, where twists occurred around every corner, and often punched you straight in the face with emotion. Due to its popularity, Hollywood seems to be ready to draw upon their talents to make a movie that can do the same. Tall orders from the popular writers, tonight's movie is a tribute to their work, one that will hopefully hold the same quality, and perhaps leave you in tears at what lies in store. Robbie K here with another review of: Movie: Life Itself (2018)Director:
 Dan Fogelman
Writer:
 Dan Fogelman
Stars:
 Oscar Isaac, Olivia Wilde, Annette Bening 
LIKES: The Acting: You know from Fogelman's work that the stories weigh heavily on the characters and the stars that make them come to life. For this guy, the acting is certainly the strongest like. Much of the cast holds the ability of bringing the characters to such realistic portrayals, controlling their emotions in this very heavily feeling based position. The chemistry with each other is fantastic, each phase holding these dynamic performances that life holds in its mystical throngs. These characters are who you have to grip to, and fortunately the acting is there to do it. The Realism: It may be overstuffed with emotion like a mega burrito, but Life Itself is all about the realism of life. This mega drama will drop much of the fantasy quirks of Hollywood to give you that slice of life to immerse in. If you want the closest thing to life in a film version, Life Itself is the one for you. The Twists: You like those jaw dropping revelations that This Is Us is capable of dropping? Well, maybe not to the same extent, but Life Itself doesn't do too shabby a job of unleashing its own surprises to help link all the tales together. What many movies (like Valentine's Day) have tried to execute the combination of stories, they often fall flat into some grand stretch to make it all work. This film, not so much. Instead, it's a well thought out plan, where these stories are designed around the connection and not vice versa. These connecting points are the key to the twist, and they hope to bring the same pizazz the TV series does. It's not quite as impressive, but it is a start!The Make-Up/Costume/Setup: Hands down, the movie has some solid artistic attributes to add to their characters that I like to give a nod too. Costumes are stylish, but not overbearing or too primary to overshadow the performances. Pregnant prosthetics are curtailed to the actress and decently integrated to again be balanced into the character. And as for the make-up, a fantastic blend of pallets to bring out physical attributes of aging as the scenes jump forward in time. It's stunning to see what they can do and really impressed me despite not being the most unique or out of this world project. The Guts: Life Itself does something many movies fear to do and that is hit the hard-hitting topics. This film is all about facing the ups and downs with life, doing a decent job of portraying these very tough, rigorous trials that life brings and how to go about working through them. And while it may be difficult to see some of these components, you've got some fantastic morals to teach you for preparation of many things. Well done their guys. 
DISLIKES: Slow Pace: Let's get this on the table, I like faster paced movies so I don't fight sleep. Life Itself is not one of these movies, for it decides to move at a slow pace to make sure you become entrenched in the character's tale. While this wasn't too bad at first, by the third chapter, I was battling my attention span's limits to not walk out. Those who like a drawn-out tale will not fell this way, but for those wanting a little brisker pace, you'll be dreading this film. Missing The Story/Development: Most fans of This Is Us I talk to love how much you are immersed into the character's lives, following their tales and uncovering every little detail at just the right moment. Life Itself had the makings of that, but it didn't quite have the same magic that they really were going for. A strong opening was quickly fizzled out by montages, shallow dialogue at times, and even some messy wrap ups that showed they were running out time. What this movie suffers in this category, is not having enough time (e.g. multiple seasons and episodes) to tell the story and therefore it did not accomplish the goals set out. Depressing: Let's be honest, this is a movie that is not for the faint of heart, the overly depressed, or hating sad stories. Life Itself is much like real life and those ups and downs can really tax the emotions and leave you feeling down. When you combine with the dislikes above, you might have an even harder time staying in the theater to heart the surprisingly powerful finish. So, heed words guys, this is not a movie for when you are feeling down, so please take heed and don't fall victim to the antics. 
The VERDICT:  Life Itself was ambitious in its goal to take the popular drama field and unleash those same emotions onto a bigger screen. While the acting, realism, artwork, and guts are all there, they aren't enough to bring the half-baked stories to full effect. There are key points that really stand out, but much of them don't have the finesse they needed, mostly due to time restraints. Nevertheless, this depressing film moves at a snail's pace and doesn't quite have the well mapped out writing to warrant the nearly 2 hours. Instead, Life Itself should have taken the carbon copy components and made a spin off show for a streaming service instead. Still, not the worst thing I have seen. 
My scores are: Drama/Romance: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5",Life Itself
11,nancyldraper,I almost didn't make it to the good parts,7,25 February 2019,"I almost didn't stay around for the good parts of this movie. The movie is divided into 5 chapters. The first two are manic and belabour its titular theme ""the most unreliable narrator is life itself"". If you are a big fan of Oscar Isaac (I am not) you may fare better in these opening chapters than I did. But, then it settles into some really beautiful moments. I was drawn to the movie by it being penned (and directed) by the writer (and producer) of THIS IS US, Dan Fogelman. The spectacular cast made me hold course. And the wonderful moments made it all worth while. All throughout the movie are reoccurring strains of a song that transform as the movie moves, making a wonderful, and inobtrusive, passageway for thought, emotion and theme. If the first two chapters hadn't been such hard work, I would rate this movie a 9 (superb) but because of the uneven, jarring transitions, I will rate this a 7.5 (wonderful moments) out of 10. {Drama}",Life Itself
12,muamba_eats_toast,Good idea but below average execution,4,3 June 2019,After spending most the film not emotionally connected and somewhat bored throughout the ending sequences did show the strong ideas behind it but the whole thing just didn't make me care enough or invest in to the characters and the film felt clunky throughout.,Life Itself
13,rockman182,Life Itself (2018),6,22 September 2018,"Never watched This is Us because it just never appealed to me. Don't get me wrong. I'm sure its a great show since the ratings are high and I hear good things. However, after watching Life Itself, I'm quite sure I have no intention of seeing the show. This film was such an emotionally manipulative mess of a film. It was a real disappoint all around which is shame with the cast involved. I'm going to go into everything I hated about the film.The film is one of those, yes. The stories are interwoven, the characters all connect to each other through generations. We start off with the love story between Oscar Isaac and Olivia Wilde's character then switch to their daughter (played by a completely underused and underutilized Olivia Cooke). Then we switch to Spain.... to connect the stories in such an ""omg this is miraculous"" way. What can I say, the film does so much wrong. I can see the potential but its a disaster from the get go.We start off with narration from Samuel Jackson narrating the story of a gay man in therapy, which actually has nothing to do with the film. Oscar Isaac plays his most annoying character to date. Olivia Wilde's character's thesis on the inaccurate narrator is terrible and an even worse way to try to connect the narration of the connected stories. Olivia Cooke is one of my favorites but she has glaringly little screen time, and is completely unlikable for the 5 minutes she gets.Then you switch to a story in Spain that drags and intends to pull at your heartstrings. It doesn't though. That's the main issue with the filmmaker and the outlined story. Its not effective in getting you invested and its a bit ridiculous how things connect at the end. I see what Dan Fogelman was going for but he was really reaching with this and focused on all the wrong aspects. He somehow made a film with unlikable characters that you just can't care for. Life Itself is bad.5/10",Life Itself
14,juanmuscle,I thought this was very well crafted!,10,14 August 2021,"I really loved this thing , the vehicle that drives everything into a gorgeous climacteric at blazing speeds only serves to make that ending so transcending! It was a wonderful meditation on the vast intricacies of life , how seemingly one moment everything can seem so bleak and without meaning and then boom , a chance encounter can change the dynamics of all those hitherto incongruences forcing us to look at how we live our lives in conjunction to our neighboring sentient corollaries.",Life Itself
15,kjproulx,"A Sappy Television Show, Condensed to Two Hours",5,13 September 2018,"The division between television shows and films has been present since the beginning of both mediums, but as time goes on, television seems to be growing into a much more cinematic offering. With shows like Stranger Things or Game of Thrones (and many others), television is rapidly evolving. On the other hand, it can't really go the other way. If a television show feels like the quality of a feature film, people will praise it until the end of time, but the reverse is usually frowned upon. Life Itself has the talent of writer/director Dan Fogleman (Danny Collins, This Is Us) at the helm, and while his efforts are definitely present, this movie feels like a television show that has been running for weeks but condensed to fit a two hour run time. Here's why I believe Life Itself doesn't quite work as a film.The plot of the movie is a spoiler in itself, so I'll refrain from going too deep here. Life Itself follows a couple who met each other at a young age but are no longer together. Their love story sets the rest of the film in motion, making for an experience that just wants to connect people through time. This film tries very hard to pull at your heartstrings and it almost deals with death a little too often. Death is far too present throughout the course of this film, making for a very sober experience. Life Itself isn't afraid to go all out when trying to make something sappy feel authentic and raw, but I don't think it always accomplishes its goal.Life Itself has a cast that deserved to be in a far better film. From Oscar Isaac to Olivia Wilde, Antonio Banderas to Annette Benning, and even the little screen time that performers like Olivia Cooke receive are all stellar from beginning to end. Tears will be shed by many, due to the sheer notion that these actors and actresses make this screenplay much better than it truly is. The screenplay itself is fine if it had been written as a short film, which leads me to my next point.The story for this film is actually quite good and may have been incredible if it had been told as a short film with not much dialogue or a ten-episode television show that fleshes out everything that felt too brief. We are given barely enough time with each character to truly care about where this story ends up throughout the final act, so I found myself latching onto early moments in the movie that had me genuinely shocked. The first act of this movie boasts a fantastic sequence involving Oscar Isaac's character in Will. I was hoping that the effectiveness that these specific moments brought to the movie would continue on, but they sort of fell by the wayside, in favour of linking storylines for the sake of an emotional twist.This is a film that's broken up into segments that may or may not eventually link together and audiences are asked to go along with many new stories, in hopes that it means something later in the film. I enjoyed each segment of the film for the most part, but the surprises just felt forced, in my opinion. Everything felt too convenient and obvious when certain elements came into play by the conclusion, but it's done in such a way that will most likely have some people weeping. I did find myself tearing up on a few occasions, but only due to either a performance or how a specific connection was made. It's well done, but not as a feature film. That may seem like a cop-out explanation, but I definitely feel that this film would've been so much better as something else.In the end, Life Itself does benefit from solid direction by Dan Fogleman. He was able to ring out some terrific performances here and piece this movie together in a way that may be clever to some viewers, but it really didn't work for me. This is the type of film that probably won't be received well by critics, due to the overall execution of it, but I can see audiences getting wrapped up in the emotional core of the movie as a whole. I fell somewhere in the middle of those two, feeling underwhelmed by the execution, but impressed at the effort made in attempting something different. I can't personally recommend this movie as a great film, but if you enjoy a bit of sap and a good cry, you may find some enjoyment out of Life Itself.",Life Itself
16,maccas-56367,An emotional rollercoaster far better than critics suggest,9,5 February 2020,"I think your enjoyment of this film depends on how much you have been truly living life. If you have been properly living life, you will have experienced many of the highs and lows depicted here, as well as strange little moments, and the coincidences which make life uniquely ours.Not really sure why this film was panned so heavily by critics and others, because I loved it. I found it unique and unlike anything I have watched before - despite certain stylistic elements sometimes feeling somewhat familiar. Each performance was strong and the chemistry between actors came across authentic. I believed each character and their emotions - even if there was occasionally an unreliable narrator thrown in HahaI genuinely found this quite unpredictable and enjoyed trying to figure out how each segment could seemingly tie into the next. Be sure to have a box of tissues on standby, because this is sure to get the waterworks flowing (unless you're a cold-hearted individual). It's certainly on the heavy-side, and veers into being a little emotionally manipulative. Despite that, I still found it enjoyable and was engaged for most of the film.Well written, philosophical and deep, Life Itself gets you reflecting about your own life and how you came to exist. Given my own recent life events, it was a well-timed watch. It also features the best double-bill of Olivias of all-time!The Rotten Tomatoes critic score is currently 14% and audience score a whopping 83% - think that says everything. Definitely recommend if you're after an emotional epic about love and life.",Life Itself

19,henrycoles9,A beautiful intersectional plot,10,23 January 2020,"This is one of those movies where things happen to two different families that eventually lead them to run into each other, and frankly this story was a masterpiece of such intersecting plots. They did a great job with the editing and the Spanish sequences starring Antonio Banderas were very endearing and heartwarming. My only complaint is that I wish there was much more of Oscar Isaac and Olivia Wilde. They are both exquisitely well suited to such intricate and touching drama and I am sad I couldn't get enough of them. But, given how wonderfully the movie touched my heart, that wouldn't make a dent in my 10/10 rating.",Life Itself
20,pkpera,This was just pain to watch right from beginning,2,31 December 2018,"I can understand that writers, director had good intention, and probably all it looked good in script (scenery) - that's why many top rated actors accepted roles in this.
The reality: that about 2 min long monologue at start, just in purpose to make some 'twist', then talk with shrink was just not fun. And all what followed was in same fashion - forced, lifeless. Yes, last word describes it best.
I think that best I can do is to stop with review right now. Does not deserve more time.",Life Itself
21,kaptenvideo-89875,"A quite sad, but nice movie about love, or at least one aspect of it",7,14 October 2018,"Young city couple goes from college romance to marriage and the birth of their child... and this should be enough to get you started.The result is an ambitious sad drama that has enough of good stuff to win over some weepies' fans... but it did not save it from getting mauled by critics.I understand what the reviewers don't like about it but personally, I still find the result compelling, and overall a solid job by by screenwriter and second time director, Dan Fogelman.Essentially, ""Life Itself"" is about love, with all the necessary components that look real nice in such kind of a movie (good-looking people, big feelings, honest conversations etc).Looking closer, though, it's most interested in a certain aspect or kind of love - this obsessiveness that comes from unfulfilled longing. One wants somebody or something from somebody more than the other one can not offer, and both suffer for that.The story is playful - there are different threads that jump back and forth in time and place, from memories to real-life to meta-commentary (breaking the fourth wall and letting the characters talk directly to the viewer).Also, the finale does an impressive job at stringing everything together, although I didn't appreciate the unnecessarily sugar-coated tone.But despite the ambitious approach to building it all up, the story itself is actually quite shallow - more interested in showing off the actors and spreading Spirituality 101 slogans such as ""power of love overcomes all"" and ""everything is connected"" than going beyond the popculture mainstream views about what love is.Having written that, the performances really are impressive all-around, and captivate with their passion and authenticity.""Life Itself"" is an ensemble work, so there are about 15 characters of importance, although many don't get much screen time.I can't decide who to leave out, so I am just gonna list all that merit a mention: Oscar Isaac, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Antonio Banderas, Laia Costa, Olivia Wilde, Olivia Cooke, Àlex Monner, Mandy Patinkin, Annette Bening, Isabel Durant, Jean Smart, Samuel L. Jackson, and Lorenza Izzo.Ensemble movies are relatively rare, especially those which really take the most of the big cast. I'd call ""Life Itself"" one of the more successful ones.There's a lot of pleasure to be had just watching Isaac going through personal hell, or triangle of Peris-Mencheta, Banderas and Costa, or always solid Patinkin aka the human equivalent of a perfect comfort food, or even Jackson in unexpected but surprisingly humorous appearance in the beginning.Oscar Isaac is one my personal favorite actors of the last five years or so, and ""Life Itself"" turns out to be a near-perfect showcase of his greatness.The ease with which he adapts to the ever-changing first chapter really screams for the Oscar nomination - the volatileness, tenderness and playfulness all combined in one very f-d up young man... I loved it.So. Despite its hidden shallows, this two hour journey has enough charms to keep the sad story lovin' audience invested.Yes, the screenplay should dig deeper psychologically but even some ""Facebook deep"" is better than no deep at all.Fogelman is still not quite the distinguished storyteller he'd like to be but this panorama of lives and loves is decidedly more heartfelt and inventive than any of his earlier work. Of which ""Guilt Trip"" and ""Danny Collins"" are the more noteworthy examples.",Life Itself
22,bastos,Very emotional but really good,8,6 October 2020,"I'm a bit conflicted about loving this movie unconditionally and being a bit more cynical and focus on some of its shortcomings to not like it. I'm leaning more on the first one due to its fantastic first chapter which I found just incredible in all aspects of filmmaking. From then on, with the exception of the introduction to the Antonio Banderas character which is another highlight, it didn't reach those heights, but that first chapter is really amazing. This is a hard movie to watch, as it is such an emotional roller coaster that by the end you're exhausted, but it is a hell of a ride. The acting is really good from everyone involved and the writing is also top notch. I'll just choose to ignore the sappy ending and some of the weaker storylines and just remember what I loved about this movie making this a bit of an unreliable review.",Life Itself

24,toncincin,Loved it!,9,2 July 2020,"It takes a while to figure out what's going on (similar to ""This is Us.""). But I loved the way the stories started intertwining after the first chapter. I wasn't sure about the part of the story in Spain (which is why I gave it a 9 instead of 10) - but it all came into focus in the final chapter. What a magnificent portrayal of how our lives cross - in sad AND happy moments. I will be watching it again.Boo to those people who hated it!",Life Itself
25,ccorral419,"Like ""Life Itself,"" the journey is at least worthy.",8,20 September 2018,"Director Dan Fogelman comes to this film riding the phenomenal creator coattails of TV's ""This is Us"". As the writer and director here, one expects a tug at the heartstrings and a smooth flowing experience to follow. However, getting there is a bit trying and over dramatic. Will (Oscar Isaac ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") and Abby (Olivia Wilde ""The Lazarus Effect"") are two NY love birds whose journey is the catalyst for many experiences that follow. Much like ""This is Us,"" it's the dramatic encounters that move the films various stories lines along. Following very unnecessary jumpy camera work that chronicles Will's morning, the camera eventually steady's as Dr. Cait Morries (the always plausible Annette Bening) pushing the story into action. Over the next two hours, a cast of enjoyable and relatable characters are introduced, bring honest performances by Mandy Patinkin, Jean Smart, Olivia Cooke ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,"" the calming Sergio Peris-Mencheta ""Snowfall"" - tv, the ever handsome Antonio Banderas, the shy Laia Costa ""Maine"", an appealing cameo by Samuel L. Jackson, and future actor to watch Alex Monner ""The Red Band Society"" TV. Fogelman enables the viewing audience to easy becomes vested in the various heart and grit characters and storylines, dropping the viewer into different environments and timelines. However, his pacing is so slow and drawn out at times, one is left wondering if and when the whole experience will finally wrap. ""Life Itself"" is getting a big push here, primarily because of Fogelman's association with ""This is Us"". It's up to you to decide if that's a good enough reason to see the film. Like ""Life Itself,"" the journey is at least worthy.",Life Itself

27,Sasha_Lauren,I avoided the critical reviews and adored this film!,9,12 June 2019,"LIFE ITSELF (2018)I came to this movie a year late and though a few friends recommended it, I managed to avoid reading any reviews about it, which turned out to be a very good thing because the critics panned it, but like many other fans, I adored it!The intro with Morgan Freeman's voice set the offbeat tone; I was interested immediately. Bring on the Bob Dylan soundtrack and obsession of Dylan from one of the first unreliable narrators, and I was all in. Well, maybe I had a toe that was out. Aspects of the story ask the audience to suspend belief and each time I questioned whether I wanted to do that or not something truly amazing, (like Antonio Bandaras' monologue as the wealthy owner of an olive ranch), would pull me gladly back in the orbit of this unconventional film. I'd forgotten how much I enjoy Antonio's acting. Oscar Isaac, Olivia Wilde, Mandy Patinkin, and Annette Bening were also terrific in this weirdly interwoven, multi-generational, transcontinental, whimsical and moving narrative.",Life Itself

29,ScoobySnacks66,Manipulative,3,20 February 2019,"I wanted to like this so much but it was ultimately very disappointing. The trailers sold a much different, much better film than the one we watched. The number of times we had to stop it to ask ourselves if something was necessary or blatantly manipulative got old quicky. It's really a shame the director messed this up so badly because the cast was solid but the story (although seemingly inspired by a hundred years of solitude) just couldn't figure out what it wanted to be and used so many situations and tropes to emotionally manipulate us it was nauseating. The most unforgivable mistake the film made was to start with two characters graduating in the 80s and end with a granddaughter publishing a novel in what the 2050s??? That's the only timeline that would make sense and yet the bookstore the movie ends in feels like 2018. Ridiculous.",Life Itself

Well, it could be interpreted that way. But backing away from that particular critique just a bit, the actual production quality is absolutely first rate, and everyone delivers their characters about as perfectly as could be done.The take away here is that life is a complex jigsaw puzzle of pieces, of which we only get a partial picture as it assembles over time. There can be terrible moments of trauma which we might experience, from which can be spawned completely unexpected but remarkable, even spectacular eventual consequences.I've seen and experienced my own share of such, so perhaps I have a bit of a personal bias here, but I would suggest that if you have a pulse, and even a passing capacity for appreciating life's variables, you might appreciate this well crafted production.At the very least, I can't imagine regretting the time it took to watch this.As stated earlier, it might have been a bit heavy handed on the melodrama in some spots, it could have actually been more compelling if delivered in somewhat more subtle fashion in those spots, so it didn't quite make a 10 for me.But I have no problem recommending a well deserved 9 stars.",Life Itself

33,SimonD1900,One of those 'celebrate life' movies.,8,15 March 2020,"Beautiful movie. Amazing script. Sad, but still uplifting. Scripts like these that has story's intertwining with each other, are kind of rare, but they do come about every now and then, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This is one of the times it works, I think. So, good job on the writer.Actually can't see any major flaws of this film. Script is good, acting is good, screenplay is good, cinematography is good, music is good. But there must be some flaws? Perhaps that it's all made up? So it doesn't really tell a ""true"" story of life. But I actually don't see that as a flaw. Perhaps that it doesn't really have any suspense? But still it's very emotionally moving and even if you kind of know were it's going at one point when you get the jest of the movie, still there are interesting details to the story that is thought provoking and interesting to follow, and the actors does a good job. The Spanish actors were really good.Hmm... Maybe not a full score just beacuse I personally can't help to find movies like this a bit corny, no matter what. But it did manage to move me at the same time. I'm probably just too emotionally blocked for this kind of stuff, I suppose, to a degree. But this movie actually made me cry a bit, and it was probably at least a couple of years ago a movie made me cry, don't really remember, but I watch a lot of movies and I don't cry often, so this movie at least achieved that.It's actually is nice sometimes, with movies that is very obviously trying to move you, you kind of get surprised when they actually succeeds with it. How corny this movie might be, I can't take away from it that it actually hit me a bit. Have to say this is one of the better movies of this sort, that I have seen. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone that is in to drama or romance (even if it's not really a romantic movie in the classical sense).Anyway, thanks for reading.",Life Itself
34,Benslie,Don't believe what the critics say,7,4 November 2018,"Now the acting in this film was marvelous. Oscar Isaac was the main stand out to me. He could easily switch from a romantic scene to a comedic scene to finally a depressing scene so well and you really feel for his character. And despite Antonio Banderas' old age, no offense, he also did a stellar performance. When I first found out that he was going to be in this film I thought, 'Oh god no,' but after seeing him in the film I now take that back. His character was one that I would love to have as a parent. The final person that I want to give a shout out to is Olivia Cooke. Her character was one that a lot of teenagers can probably relate to, or at least the ones who went through similar/the same experiences/situations like what she did. The humour in this film was definitely directed at younger people because my friend and I were laughing a lot when nobody else was, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. In addition, the cinematography was stunning in this film, and each shot had great lighting . The final good thing I want to mention is how well the serious scenes were taken. Some films can't do serious scenes without making a joke out of it or it being out of place but this film did them so well. This might have come from how the director and writer, Dan Fogelman, also created ""This is Us,"" so he knows how to do drama. Now for some of the bad things. The pacing in this seemed off, just by a bit. It felt like they would drag on too much of one person's story and then cut it short at some of the others. Now I understand that they probably wanted to keep it short, but maybe a longer movie would have helped it out a bit more. The movie was predictable as well. Sometimes, being predictable is fine but not when you're trying to make your audience cry. In the end, ""Life Itself"" really depends on what you look for in a movie. If you like romcoms then you'll like this movie, but if you don't, you'll probably won't .",Life Itself

45,Nathan4,Just ok,5,27 June 2019,"The beginning was so bad that initially my wife and I stopped watching about a half hour in. I went back a few days later and finished it, and it was pretty decent the rest of the way. However, on multiple occasions something happened or people did things (or reacted in a certain way) that was so unbelievable as to pull you out of the story. And this is a shame, because overall the dialogue is great and the plot is decent. I also really liked the soundtrack in this one.But in the end, the writer simply tried too hard to make the viewer cry at all costs instead of creating a believable story. It reminds me a bit of the end of Titanic - so if you thought the ending of Titanic was amazing and believable, you'll probably look right past all of the shortcomings of this film and love this movie. But if you (like me) thought the ending was a bit too cheesy and unbelievable (I mean, pull him up with you onto the door to save him, Rose!) and kind of ruined the movie a bit, Life Itself will leave you a bit disappointed as well.",Life Itself
46,mamlukman,Best movie of the 23 we saw at TIFF,10,21 September 2018,"We just returned from the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. We saw 23 movies, and my wife and I agree this was the best we saw.Ignore the critics. They say things like ""It's just like X,"" or ""He borrowed this from Y,"" or ""It's too unrealistic."" Nonsense. Who cares?If you are looking for an engrossing story, this is it. The four-segment format is great, because it keeps you wondering ""What has this segment got to do with what the previous segment was about?"" And you quickly find out. But you never know where it's going--the end is unpredictable, but thoroughly possible.Granted, there are those who have never run into a coincidence in their lives. I feel sorry for those people. I know in my own life I have been surrounded by coincidences: at a recent conference I idly began chatting to a guy in front of me. We had shared the same thesis advisor! When I lived in Saudi Arabia, who moved in next door? A junior h.s. classmate of my wife's--he had moved away in junior high and she had not heard anything about him until 25 years later he popped up 10,000 miles away as her next door neighbor. Every time we go to Europe we bump into people we know. Coincidences--even extremely improbable ones--are part of life. If you accept this, this is the movie for you.Great performances by a variety of actors. And the end....everyone in the theater was sniffling, and it wasn't because they had colds. It touched each and every one of us, and in the end, isn't that what a movie should do? I think so.",Life Itself
