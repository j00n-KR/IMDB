0,Leofwine_draca,The grisliest Jack the Ripper yet,8,19 July 2016,"The story of Jack the Ripper has long been of interest in the horror cinema. Right back in the creaky old days of the silents he made his appearances in the likes of 1926's WAXWORKS and Hitchcock's THE LODGER. An infamous black and white British version of the tale, made in 1959 by a cheap rival to Hammer, has fallen into obscurity but is still best remembered for the final reel, in which the killer is caught beneath a lift and the screen turns to glorious blood red colour for an instant to capture his gory demise. In the 1970s, European horror veteran Jess Franco gave us his typically sleazy variant with 1976's nasty JACK THE RIPPER, with Klaus Kinski in the leading role, whilst Spanish stalwart Paul Naschy made his own variant. In 1988, to mark the centenary of the Ripper murders, a supposedly definitive television miniseries was made in America starring Michael Caine as the investigating policeman. It's a good but flawed telling of the story marred only by the TV-movie level it never rises above. And now, to mark the new millennium, two brothers best known for their gangster rap movies have given the world FROM HELL, which is for a change based on a graphic novel (which I haven't read) of the Ripper story rather than the real-life murder investigation itself.As a horror film, it works. Everything about this film screams style and class. For a change the gory murders and surgical operations that Jack carries out on his deeply unfortunate victims are shown in graphic detail, rather than only being spoken of like in previous versions of the tale, and no expense is spared in giving us graphic, stomach-churning scenes of the cloaked Ripper calmly sawing out the internal organs of his female victims, kneeling above their prone bodies. Entrails are torn out and wrapped around necks and throats are slashed emitting geysers of crimson gore. Police surgeons repeatedly vomit at the sight of the mutilated corpses and quick flash cuts show us all we need to know about the severity of the crimes, so on a visceral level at least FROM HELL offers pure horror, sometimes nausea-inducing and all the more effective for it. Scenes of the victims being stalked at night by the cruel killer are highly suspenseful, heightened by the dark, baroque music that accompanies them and a high class of acting from all concerned.Attention to detail also contributes to this movie's success and I would go so far as to say that this is the most authentic-looking Jack the Ripper film that I've yet to see. Although some of the choice language is a little too modern to be that convincing the rest of the dialogue, the sets, the scenery and the costumes are spot-on. You have to love the brief appearance of the Elephant Man into the thick of the action and the secret society of Freemasons who operate below ground. Characters sport lived-in clothes rather than the off-the-shelf garb of the Caine miniseries and the London setting is brilliantly portrayed as a rancid den of sleaze and open depravity, packed with opium dens, pubs full of drunken angry men, and streets littered with filth and beggars.The cinematography is spot-on and helps to transport you back to 1888, putting you into the realism of the action as we watch drug-induced nightmares of the Ripper slicing up his victims and taking them to pieces. After the initial half hour which bluntly introduces Jack's figure into the depressing London streets the film takes the form of a detective tale as policeman Johnny Depp searches for clues to find the identity of the killer. Once again the film takes the well-worn conspiracy route of there being a royal connection to the killer, so whilst it lacks the element of surprise (aside from those who are complete Ripper novices) the final unmasking of the villain is still a fine piece of shock cinema and the last reel very exciting, incorporating a violent cab ride and the most gruesome murder saved for last into the proceedings.The cast is bolstered by a host of familiar British faces like Ian Richardson who bring a touch of class to the production although ironically the two leads are American (though you wouldn't guess it, as they do sport impeccable accents as is the norm these days). Johnny Depp once again proves he can do no wrong and it's fair to say that he's become a mini-horror star in recent years with all the genre productions he keeps making. Depp's opium-addicted young policeman makes a nice change from the decent, elder investigators (like Michael Caine in the 1988 miniseries) and he plays a charming, interesting central figure and one which the audience can thankfully emphasise with. Robbie Coltrane plays it tough as Depp's sergeant and basically acts as the comic relief of the production (and boy, does this horrific outing need it). Heather Graham (BOOGIE NIGHTS) is also delightful as Mary Kelly, a would-be victim of the Ripper, and as well as looking spot-on in the role, all flowing red locks and heaving bosoms just like in one of the old Hammer films, plays her part with some skill.I don't have an unpleasant word to say about anyone else, but special kudos goes to Ian Holm who plays a kindly retired surgeon in one of his last major roles. Subtle use of black contact lenses turn the killer into a deeply scary-looking man and the actor playing Jack really does deserve an Oscar for his role here - the final murder in which he believes he is teaching a class is magnificently-evoked stuff and very clever indeed. FROM HELL is a quality production and one of the better versions of the tale and it will certainly take some doing to better this in the future; for now be content in watching what is a well-paced, scary, sometimes disturbing modern horror yarn.",From Hell
1,SnoopyStyle,"love the dark, murky, brutal style",7,25 November 2015,"It's 1888 London haunted by Jack the Ripper. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) is a prostitute in the Whitechapel District. Her friend Ann Crook has a baby and a rich mystery patron. Ann gets kidnapped while others are getting killed. Mary Kelly hides the baby. Police Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) has visions which help in his brilliant investigations with his partner Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane). Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) is a physician to the Royals and a respected medical teacher.I love the dark, murky, brutal style. It's fitting for the times and the subject matter. The story is a bit disjointed which I like for this movie. It's a jumble of pieces from two sides of a story coming together. It is bloody and ominous. Granted, the story doesn't flow smoothly but the style more than makes up for it.",From Hell
2,lee_eisenberg,take dark to the next level,8,9 June 2006,"""From Hell"" presents something not seen in movies since the old Sherlock Holmes movies. It tells the story of an inspector (Johnny Depp) investigating the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888 London, but it suggests that the decadent aristocrats in a way aren't much better than the murderer himself. Of course, the setting is like a star on its own: eerie, dismal streets that look like they could be hiding almost anything...ANYTHING. As for the question of historical accuracy, that doesn't really seem to be an issue. You have to focus on the bleak, evil surroundings to really get the feeling.Depp is great in his role, as can be expected. Also starring is Heather Graham as prostitute Mary Kelly; let me tell you, this is a role very far removed from her comedic ones. Robbie Coltrane plays a sergeant; because of this movie's grim nature, you probably will be able to forget that he plays Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies. Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng and Katrin Cartlidge also star. Maybe the most surprising thing about ""From Hell"" is that it was directed by Albert and Allen Hughes (known for movies like ""Dead Presidents"").Overall, this is not a movie to be missed. It just goes to show that real horror entails that which we don't know. Very well done.",From Hell
3,jboothmillard,From Hell,7,14 July 2005,"Jack the Ripper, whoever he is, once said ""People will say I gave birth to the 20th Century"", I don't know in what sense he meant, but he certainly made an impact in his time, and is still a significant figure of history. So this film set in 1888, Victorian London, focuses on the events concerning him. Basically drug-taking, premonition dreaming Inspector Frederick 'Fred' Abberline (Johnny Depp) is the man investigating the murders of many female prostitutes, with their throats slit and bodies mutilated, some with internal organs removed. One of the prostitutes in fear of this psycho Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), helping Abberline with the investigation Sgt. Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and Sir William Gull (Sir Ian Holm) is the man who later seems to be the most likely suspect. That's really all I can say about the plot. Also starring Ian Richardson as Sir Charles Warren, Jason Flemyng as John Netley the Coachman, Katrin Cartlidge as Dark Annie Chapman, Lesley Sharp as Kate Eddowes, Susan Lynch as Liz Stride, Terence Harvey as Benjamin 'Ben' Kidney, Annabelle Apsion as Polly Nichols and Estelle Skornik as Ada. It is a chilling story, and the filmmakers specifically wanted to keep the violence to a minimum, in my opinion I think they should have exploited it, or better yet, reveal the real identity of Jack the Ripper while doing so. Very good!",From Hell
4,ccthemovieman-1,Stylishly Filmed But Sordidly Told,5,28 March 2007,"This is stylishly presented, and I always find stories of the famous ""Jack The Ripper"" to be fascinating, but this is not necessarily a likable film. Perhaps I excepted more, but this was a bit too sordid in spots. I gave it a second look I year later, after buying the DVD, and found it so sleazy I wound up trading the disc. This movie never succeeded at the box office, and I can see why: bad vibes and poorly told, despite the fine cinematography.Most films starring Johnny Depp are entertaining, and this is no exception. I never got bored with the story but, in addition to the sordid tone to it, I question the storyteller's bias against Masons (no, I am not one nor have any interest in them) and thought there was a bit of anti-Christian prejudice, too. I couldn't understand a lot of the accents, either, which lessens the enjoyment of watching it.",From Hell
5,BA_Harrison,Ripper!,8,16 February 2014,"Legendary bewhiskered comic creator Alan Moore has famously distanced himself from all cinematic adaptations of his work, never happy with the end results. It's a pattern that started in 2001 with From Hell, a speculative account of the infamous Jack The Ripper case, directed by The Hughes Brothers and starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. In bringing the graphic novel to life, alterations were made by the film-makers to both characters and plot—changes that were substantial enough to incur the wrath of Mr. Moore.However, while I can fully appreciate how Moore feels (no artist likes to have their work messed around with), I believe that the film is still a very accomplished and entertaining piece that more than warrants merit. A wonderfully realised, bold and bloody take on an oft-told tale, From Hell benefits from confident direction, great production values, and solid performances from a terrific cast, with Hollywood stars Depp and Graham both taking a good stab (pun intended) at the London accent (while they're not perfect, they're more than serviceable) while Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, Jason Flemyng and a whole raft of other talented players do their utmost to ensure an authentic East End flavour overall.The plot, although heavily revised, holds together very nicely and remains utterly fascinating, pointing the finger of suspicion at both the Freemasons and the Royal Family, making the whole thing a blast for conspiracy theorists and republicans alike. To Moore, I say 'so what if this isn't exactly what you had in mind—at least it's not as bad as what Snyder did to 300'.",From Hell
6,Quinoa1984,Impressive retelling of the graphic novel by The Hughes brothers.,8,20 October 2001,"(possible spoilers)From Hell tells the story of Jack the Ripper in 1888, possibly one of the most infamous murderers, in an enriched and stylized way pumped up with some good old killing scenes.  Johhny Depp plays an investigator in England who can find who the Ripper may attack next in his visions and begins to get close to someone who could be next (Heather Graham plays this next, a helpful prostitute).  How he sees these visions? He is a regular opium taker and in his state he sees these gruesome details.  The story wanders here and there, yet it's made up in the most part by a rich and darkly exhilarating atmosphere evoked by the Allen and Albert Hughes and their photographer peter Deming, and by some fine performances turned in by Depp, (dare I say) Graham and Ian Holm who plays a hierarchy figure, so to speak.  It might not be for all tastes, but for those interested (or those who took interest in the graphic novel) won't be disapointed.One more note: adding the Elephant man may not be neccessary in a movie about Jack the Ripper, but credit is due in having two of the 19th centuries more famous English gentlemen in one film.  A-",From Hell
7,BandSAboutMovies,Alan Moore hates his movies lol,7,25 February 2019,"Loosely based on Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel, the Hughes Brothers were criticized by Moore for replacing his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy."" They should have been ready for that - Moore hasn't enjoyed a single adaption of his work.Here, the directors of Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and The Book of Eli go to Whitechapel to tell the story of who Jack the Ripper very well may have been.
Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her friends are all London prostitutes who must avoid violence whle trying to make a living with their bodies. When one of their friends, Ann Crook, is taken after her rich boyfriend returns, they learn that they are being hunted down and mutilated one by one. Soon, Whitechapel Police Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is on the case, guided by psychic visions that he abates with opium.His theory - which his partner Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) doesn't quite understand - is that the Ripper is a highly educated medical professional. After meeting with Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), the physician to the Royal Family, Abberline starts to see that there is a dark conspiracy behind everything, particularly the influence of the Freemasons.The truth is that Gull is the killer, taking out the witnesses to painter Albert Sickert's forbidden marriage and child with Crook. The bigger secret is that Sickert is Prince Albert, grandson of reigning Queen Victoria, and their daughter is a royal heir.I don't want to give away much more - I've already said so much - but nothing ends well, to say the least. While not as deep as Moore and Campbell's graphic novel, this film has an interesting visual style and really depicts the squalor of London in the time of the Ripper. I really liked the way the opium visions and murderous messages were presented here. There's really no reason for the Elephant Man to show up or the main characters' romance, though. It all feels somewhat thrown in.",From Hell
8,Coventry,The Grapes of DEATH!,7,4 November 2005,"This isn't the first movie about the notorious late 19th century serial killer Jack The Ripper and it sure as 'hell' won't be the last. ""From Hell"" is, however, the most budgeted one of the bunch and also the first (at least, by my knowledge) that actually attempts severely to reveal the possible identity of Jackie-boy and the motivations behind his gruesome killings. The screenplay for this film was adapted from authentic police reports from that period, and the prostitute-murders are truthful reconstructions, based on original illustrations and drawings. This realism results in a very compelling, powerful and often shocking first half hour. The prostitutes (or ""unfortunate women"" as they are referred to) of the London Whitechapel-quarter are approached by a sophisticated gentleman in a black coach, who offers them drapes and a tempting amount of money. Shortly after, their murdered bodies are found severely mutilated. They also seem to be missing organs that were removed surgically, which raises the suspicion that the killer might very well be a man of high standing. Police inspector (and full-time opium-addict) Abberline devotedly investigates the case and stumbles on eminent organizations that surely don't want to be linked with the murders. Director-duo Albert and Allen Hughes somewhat lose their grip on the complex story after the third murder and the film's climax is sorely disappointing. The most fascinating thing about the entire production unquestionably is the breathtaking Victorian setting! The London of 1888 is terrifically illustrated, with its foggy streets; corrupt police system and enormous differences in social class. Much more than a horror portrait, ""From Hell"" is a raw ghetto-drama about survival! This isn't surprising, since the directors previously made the minor classics ""Menace II Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"" that are all about social conflicts. Johnny Depp is terrific as usual, Heather Graham makes your heart melt and the supportive cast exists of multi-talented British actors such as Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings), Jason Flemying (Snatch) and Robbie Coltrane (Mona Lisa). Recommended!",From Hell
9,michaelRokeefe,Have mercy on the children and creatures of the night.,6,18 April 2003,"Graphic and potent crime thriller from the Hughes Brothers. Fantasy and speculation provides entertainment on the edge. Versatile Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted police inspector who uses his clairvoyant powers to try and track down Jack the Ripper. While investigating the gruesome murders in 1888 London inspector Abberline(Depp)finds himself falling in love with an intended victim Mary Kelly(Heather Graham). Just over two hours and sometimes a little choppy plotwise. Depp is intense and affable. Even the chalky looking Graham makes for a winsome prostitute. Supporting cast includes Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Paul Rhys. It is probably a good idea to watch on an empty stomach.",From Hell
10,Theo Robertson,You Can Tell This Is An American Film,5,28 August 2003,"Why is it Americans have a laughably ethnocentric view of Britain ? They seem to be under the impression that each and every person of the United Kingdom is a cockney who says "" Cor blimey Guv "" a lot and works as a chimney sweep . In fact the only people we see in American movies who aren`t cockneys are the royal family ! Even BAND OF BROTHERS suffers from this flaw and that was a BBC  co-production ! I must admit that it was nice to see the producers FROM HELL did their homework on 19th century London - By watching MARY POPPINS over and over againNot having a time machine I`ve never been to 1888 London but can`t help thinking the ethnic make of the city is all wrong with everyone talking with a cockney accent , wouldn`t London be full of Scots and Irish swapping their Scottish and Irish slums for one in London ? Just curious because everyone with the exception of Robbie Coltrane`s character is either a cockney or a former public schoolboy , and of course by casting a bunch of native Brits you can`t help notice how bad the accents coming from Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are . Depp especially is abysmalAs the film continues you still notice the annoying accents but other irritants force their way into the movie . Despite having characters that existed in real life they`re written beyond all recognition , for instance Inspector Abberline had visions of the killings like some sort of psychic ? I don`t think so , oh and that bit with the diversion at Special Branch didn`t happen either and there`s no evidence he had a relationship with Mary Kelly or that any of the victims knew each other . Talking of Mary Kelly I was going to point out that , physically at least , that the real life Mary Kelly does not in any way resemble the one seen here but being an American film you`ve got to excuse some artistic license where glamour is involved
Actually this glamour jars with the opening of the film which shows the London of 1888 being a human hell hole with drunkeness and drug addiction being the norm . Strangely this actually correct , in those days drugs weren`t outlawed and a great many people took all types of drugs that would now be called "" Class A drugs ""( Including Queen Victoria ) though there`s no evidence Inspector Abberline was a user , so once again it`s disappointing to see so much historical inaccuracy involved especially The Rippers motivations . I can`t disprove the theories put forward but do empires collapse like this ? In my opinion - No . Oh and talking of The Ripper it`s very very obvious who he is when he first opens his mouth about twenty minutes into the movie because you`ll be able to recognise the actor`s voice straight awaySo FROM HELL could have been a very good movie , but alas it`s not",From Hell
11,Hey_Sweden,"Well done, if not too memorable.",8,16 October 2013,"""From Hell"" is very grim and ultra stylish filmmaking, most impressive for the way it depicts late 19th century London. It's a bleak image of Hell on Earth, an environment in which a maniac dubbed Jack the Ripper is able to flourish. Bloody Jack is carving up prostitutes in horrific fashion, and the weary inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is on the case. A haunted individual who uses drugs and experiences psychic visions, Abberline develops an attraction to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the Whitechapel whores whom he encounters. He soon discovers that there are secrets that important people want to keep secret, and that Jacks' motive might be more complex than he believes.Depp delivers a particularly solid, if somewhat eccentric, performance as Abberline, and receives excellent support from a mostly British cast. Graham manages to be somewhat convincing and not stick out too much. Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Terence Harvey, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, and Lesley Sharp co-star. Holm and Flemyng have particularly interesting roles. The story, adapted by Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is intricately plotted and involving, and it keeps the viewer guessing and on their toes, wondering who will be revealed as the Ripper and it may even catch them off guard when the end does come. Technically, the film is a marvel, with top notch direction by Allen and Albert Hughes, and eye catching production design (by Martin Childs) and cinematography (by Peter Deming). The period recreation is strong, with location filming done in the Czech Republic. There's also a wonderfully ominous score composed by Trevor Jones.The film doesn't really trend on unfamiliar ground, at least not to ""Ripperphiles"", but it's quite good and entertaining, and a worthy viewing for horror fans.Eight out of 10.",From Hell
12,preppy-3,Johnny Depp vs. Jack the Ripper,7,22 October 2001,"A police inspector (Johnny Depp) in 1888 London tries to capture Jack the Ripper.  Unfortunately, he falls in love with one of his intended victims (Heather Graham).  Very loud (WAY too many shots and sounds of stairs coming down from carriages--the sound is ear-splitting!), dark and confusing.  The movie looks fantastic--there are some breath-taking shots of Victorian London.  But, plotwise, it's a mess.  It moves quickly but is very confusing at the beginning, way too plot heavy (the film is almost 150 minutes) for its own good and throws in hallucinatory images ad nauseum (Depp has too many drug-induced ""visions"").  The acting helps--Depp is excellent in his role--he looks very handsome and nicely underplays it.  Graham is good but looks terrible--way too pale and drab (but then, she IS playing a prostitute).  The film doesn't skimp on blood and gore--there's not a lot of violence, but when there is it's not pretty.  Ultimately, the film is too long, too grim and too depressing to really enjoy.  Still the producers/directors the Hughes Brothers are talented men.  Let's see more of them.",From Hell

There are as many conspiracies as the JFK assassination and very few scholars agree on anything if not everything. It is an ultra-stylish, nightmarish Movie with some modern Film flourishes that work well in this hallucinatory Hell.There are some impressive set details and the story is rich with Masons, Whores, Royalty, Physicians, and Police. Quite the Victorian mix of upper and lower echelons that blend uneasily in a time of pompous self-righteousness and ego-maniacal excesses that helped give birth to the Twentieth Century and Liberalism.This is a visually vibrant and fearless rendition. It has an infectious feel. As entertainment this is a sharp edged Film that cuts psychedelic and mystical mayhem dripping with theatrical and melodramatic turns and penetrating presentations of an ugly and unfortunate setting and time.",From Hell
14,poolandrews,"""England doesn't have any whores, just a great mass of very unlucky women."" Overlong inaccurate account of Jack the Ripper.",6,27 June 2005,"From Hell is set in the filth of a Victorian London during 1888 in the Whitechapel District where it seems there are prostitutes & knife wielding maniac's on every corner, a bit like it is now then really! It starts by introducing a group of six friends, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Ann Crook (Joanna Page), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) & Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp) who all happen to be prostitutes & supposedly look out for each other. One member of the group, Ann Crook is now the Mother of a young baby, has recently married into money & promises the girls that she will give them four quid to pay a Victorian pimp named McQueen (David Schofield) & his men. Shortly after the girls then witness Ann, her husband Albert (Mark Dexter) & their baby being dragged screaming from a flat by Ben Kidney (Terence Harvey) & his men who all work for Scotland Yard special branch, later on that night Mary is warned not to mention to anyone what she saw. Also that night Polly is brutally murdered, she has her throat cut from ear to ear & her body is horribly mutilated. The drug addicted Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) & Scotland Yard's finest are on the case. Annie Chapman is next to be brutally slain by the killer who has become known as 'Jack the Ripper', getting absolutely nowhere with his investigations Inspector Abberline seeks the advice of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) & his protégé Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys). Together they agree that the 'Ripper' is probably an educated man & very knowledgeable about human anatomy & the use of surgical instruments indicating that he may be a Doctor. As Abberline gets closer to unveiling 'Jack the Rippers' identity he faces resistance from his superiors, special branch, falls in love with Mary & uncovers dark secrets & conspiracy's that go to the very highest levels of Royalty & Government...Executive produced & directed by Albert & Allen Hughes as The Hughes Brothers I thought From Hell was an OK mystery thriller but nothing to get too excited about. The script by Terry Hayes & Rafael Yglesias based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore & Eddie Campbell is far too long & becomes dull to watch as it neither works as a factual reconstruction of the 'Ripper' events or as a fictional horror/thriller, this feels like a teen slasher based around a few of the more well-known Ripper elements. There are massive inaccuracies between what takes place in From Hell & what happened in reality, the prostitutes never knew each other & if this is the case then the entire explanation that From Hell gives must be wrong & therefore most of From Hell is pure fiction straight away & this alone destroys any sort of credibility that it tries to achieve. Inspector Abberline was nothing like Johnny Depp & he lived until 1929 & had a distinguished career, & I'm not too sure if the real Inspector Abberline would have had psychic visions of the murders before they happened! I'm positive that there are loads more too. From Hell falls also flat as a fictional tale because it is just far to intricate, there are too many characters who do very little, not enough screen time is given to the 'Ripper' or his motives & far too much time is given to the group of moaning filthy prostitutes. I also thought the semi-happy ending & Jack's eventual motive were well off the pace. But the thing that really sinks From Hell in my humble opinion is that it is just so slow, dull & uneventful. In fact I actually fell asleep about 20 or so minutes before the end & had to rewind the tape so I could catch the end, I shouldn't have bothered really. On a positive note From Hell has exceptional production design, the filth, squaller & nastiness of the back streets of Victorian London are wonderfully recreated in great detail. From Hell is also a visually strong film with some flashy camera techniques like when the Ripper stabs a girl in a pitch black archway where at first the only thing we see is the silver blade of his knife as it catches the light but the blade starts to turn more red each time it re-catches the light after disappearing for a second, editing tricks & nice use of CGI to enhance certain imagery & some of the cityscapes of Victorian London with a shot of Big Ben in complete shadow at night & a gorgeous looking red sky behind it particularly springing to mind. The violence & gore was mostly implied & mostly consisted of graphic shots of dead bodies although there is one of the best on screen slit throats it's been my pleasure to view... Technically From Hell is top-notch throughout, but then that's the least I expect from a film with an estimated budget of $35,000,000, the acting is very good from all involved & a special mention goes to the fantastic Robbie Coltrane who is just brilliant & makes his character very likable. Overall I thought From Hell was an OK way to pass a couple of hours & I can't in all honesty call it a bad film but it could have been done with being 15 or 20 odd minute's shorter which would have increased the pace & helped maintain my interest. As it stands I don't think I'll be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon. Worth watching if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on TV for free.",From Hell

17,Boba_Fett1138,Visually a great movie but the storytelling is lacking.,6,25 September 2005,"This is a beautiful movie to look at. The Hughes brothers (Albert and Allen) directed the movie with lots of flair and provide the movie with some stylish and beautiful looking moments. They just seemed to concentrated a bit too much on the visual style and a little too less on bringing the story to the screen. The story is brought a bit too vaguely and not everything seems always to make sense. Basically the fact that Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) has psychic abilities in the movie is pointless and never ever really serves a purpose. Yes, it does provide the movie with some visual nice looking weird scene's but it doesn't really add anything to the story. The story itself of Jack The Ripper is quite tense and mysterious but this movie never truly becomes tense.The movie gives a pretty good view of 1888 London and has some excellent looking sets and uses perfect lighting for the scene's, to create the right atmosphere.The cast is well filled with some impressive names. Having Johnny Depp in a movie is never a bad thing and the other most important characters are played by the other well known actors; Heather Graham, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm.If you like eye candy this is a perfect movie for you to watch. If you like a tense mysterious crime movie this is probably not the best movie for you to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",From Hell
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,You can practically smell Whitechapel,8,29 October 2009,"I have not read the Alan Moore graphic novel, though since I am a fan of his work, I may very well do so. However, I understand that it is dramatically different from this. In case you are not aware, no, this is not a completely factual account of the infamous case of Jack the Ripper. The FAQ has all the details. What this does do is go into one or two of the more interesting theories, the juiciest of them, and end up with an entertaining, exciting and pretty engaging mystery-thriller that will at the very least be a fun two hours, even if some people will be able to figure out what's going on before it is revealed. The editing and cinematography are utterly gorgeous, and I'd definitely give another film directed by the Hughes brothers a chance. Visually, this never lets the audience down. And it does well as far as substance goes, as well. This builds atmosphere quite effectively, and in spite of the varying degrees of stylization that this indulges in at points, the sombre mood is constant from the first frame to the very last. Acting is solid, and the parts are well-cast. There are a couple of gold nuggets here and there in the dialog. The music is fitting and great. This holds a lot of authenticity, and the production values leave nothing to be desired. There is moderately frequent strong language, brief full frontal nudity, plenty of sensuality and sexuality in this, as well as disturbing content, bloody violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genres this falls into, and/or is fascinated with the subject matter. Just make sure you've got the stomach for it. 8/10",From Hell
19,view_and_review,I'm Used to Hollywood Disappointments,5,1 February 2021,"I'm not a Ripperologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night. Not really, but I read a book about Jack the Ripper. ""From Hell"" is a fictionalized version of the Jack the Ripper events.In this Hollywood version of JTR, Johnny Depp plays an investigator who is hot on the trail of the killer. He was a brilliant investigator head and shoulders above everyone else.The real JTR killed five prostitutes and was never found. He killed Polly Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Kelly. He butchered them in a most gruesome manner.In the Hollywood version he was caught and Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, escaped death. That could've been because she was beautiful while the other victims weren't, or it could've been because she was the love interest of Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), or both. While every other prostitute in the east end of London had bad dental hygiene, was dirty, and not much to look at, Mary Kelly was clean, pristine, and a picture of health and beauty.""From Hell"" was OK at best. It fancied itself a murder mystery with some graphic bloody murders for effect. I couldn't get into it knowing that Heather Graham was there to be the love interest and possibly saved. How could you come to any other conclusion when she stood out amongst her peers like a diamond in the rough. Surely, JTR wouldn't be able to kill a lovely woman such as Heather Graham. But by now I'm used to Hollywood disappointments.",From Hell
20,anaconda-40658,To Hell With This Film.,2,16 September 2015,"From Hell (2001): Dir: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes / Cast: Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson: Based upon the legend of Jack the Ripper and couldn't be any more dull than if it was read in history class. And what the title means is a mystery since the villain is human. It opens in the late 1800's London where prostitutes are murdered with slashed throats and grape stems in their hands. Perhaps if Mr. Ripper was more flamboyant he could have left an entire fruit salad and a glass of wine with lemon wedged on the edge. Johnny Depp is brought in as an inspector and the rest is a bloody mess right up to its stupid climax. Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes with repetitious storytelling. They previous made Menace to Society. Here they present a complete menace to one's intelligence. Depp is reciting Sleepy Hallow and despite that film's appeal, his role lacks ambition here. Heather Graham plays one of the brainless prostitutes. These hookers are warned not to venture out after dark but that doesn't seem to sink in. Also with Ian Holm, Ian Richardson and Robbie Coltrane who have both done far better films than this. For a scarier film starring Depp, I recommend Tim Burton's ravishing version of Sleepy Hollow. As for this film, it has superb art direction but blood and guts are strewn with the sound of swishing blades. Score: 2 / 10",From Hell
21,Wuchakk,"From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp",7,15 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective's interest.The film was based on Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy,"" referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there's no evidence that Abberline ""chased the dragon"" or that he had ""psychic visions."" Speaking of real life, Moore's graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book ""Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution."" This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.""From Hell"" plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are ""Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed"" (1969) and ""Taste the Blood of Dracula"" (1970). ""From Hell"" even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society 'gentlemen' in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer's Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).GRADE: B",From Hell
22,zetes,Truly effective Gothic horror film,10,20 March 2002,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly, saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was ""good,"" but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it, I thought it looked nice but moved too fast, was a little dumb. But by the end, I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure, it's a triumph of style over substance, but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.I would compare From Hell most closely to Alex Proyas' 1997 triumph Dark City, which, like From Hell, made almost nothing at the box office. I hope, like Dark City, that From Hell will win a larger audience on video. It's not as intelligent as Dark City, which was brilliant in nearly every way, but From Hell equals it in visual virtuosity. Its story, while sometimes lapsing into silliness, is enormously gripping. It's also one of the few horror films to succeed at inducing a sense of dread in the audience. A Scotland Yard detective (played well by Johnny Depp) is on the case of Jack the Ripper, who is himself on the trail of a group of five prostitutes. On the way, Depp discovers that the ritualistic murders are part of a larger conspiracy. The film is full of great twists, the biggest one being simply hilarious in its level of audacity. The end is quite unpredictable (although the climax is a little too predictable).There are several minor flaws in the film. It does go a bit too fast, but its breathless pace ends up paying off well in the end. Many people will be turned off at the level of gore in the film. Seriously, avoid it at all costs if you have a weak stomach. But if you could take it in Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, or Sleepy Hollow, you'll be fine. I actually felt that those three particular films flaunted their gore and were tremendously ineffective in their horror. Yes, even (and perhaps especially) Silence of the Lambs. I don't know why, but I didn't feel that way about From Hell. 10/10.",From Hell

Pretty sure it never happened like in From Hell but it doesn't matter. It's an entertaining movie and that's all we want. Johnny Depp as Inspector Frederick Abberline is of course the main character and does a good job like we are used from him. The other actors are all good as well. It might not be the best story I ever saw from Jack The Ripper but it keeps you interested till the end. It's a dark movie, everything I would expect from London Whitechapel in that period. And for that alone you should give credit to this movie. Nice filming with nice sound effects and with good actors. What else do we need?",From Hell
25,whpratt1,Different Jack the Ripper Film,7,4 December 2007,"This is definitely a great horror film which gives in great detail the actual facts of what Jack the Ripper did to his victims back in the Year 1888 which terrified all of London. This story of Jack the Ripper is different in many ways because it involves an Inspector Frederick Abberline, (Johnny Depp) who is in charge of the investigation of the Ripper and centers his attention to four London prostitutes who are being eliminated by the cruel knife of the Ripper. Mary Kelley, (Heather Graham) is one of these prostitutes and the Inspector Abberline begins to fall in love with her and does everything he can to protect her. You will never be able to figure out who the Ripper is until almost the very end of this film and the ending could never be any better.

26,JamesHitchcock,Pandering to Prejudice and Paranoia,5,19 May 2020,"Violent crime. Sex. A true-life mystery. An atmospheric setting in foggy, gas-lit Victorian London. The Jack the Ripper murders would seem to have all that is needed for a great thriller, apart from one thing. A solution. Unsolved crimes do not make for good cinema. Who wants to watch a murder mystery film which ends with Sherlock Holmes, or Poirot, or Columbo, admitting ""Well, frankly, I'm baffled. I don't think we're ever going to find the killer""?So anyone wanting to make a film about the Ripper needs to come up with their own solution. And there's no shortage of possible suspects. More than a hundred individuals have been suggested as Jack the Ripper, including many with no known connection to the case and even some who would not have been able to commit the crimes. Some, for example, have proposed a Scottish-born American doctor named Neill Cream, even though he had a perfect alibi; at the time of the Ripper murders he was in prison in Chicago.Film-makers, however, have generally ignored most of these hundred-odd suspects and have concentrated upon a now-discredited theory first advanced by the writer Stephen Knight. ""From Hell"", like ""Murder by Decree"" from 1978 and the eighties TV serial ""Jack the Ripper"", assumes that the murders were connected to Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, who, but for his own early death, would have become King Albert I on the death of his father Edward VII. This does not mean that they accuse the Prince of carrying out the murders himself. (Some theorists have indeed done this, generally ignorant of the fact that, for most of the killings, Albert Victor had alibis nearly as cast-iron as Cream's). The theory put forward here (and in ""Murder by Decree"") is that the Prince had secretly married a prostitute named Annie Crook and the murdered women, all prostitutes themselves and friends of Crook, had been present at the wedding. The murders are carried out on the Queen's orders by her personal physician Sir William Gull to prevent news of the marriage from becoming public, a task in which he has the assistance of a sinister brotherhood of Freemasons.A main character here is Police Inspector Frederick Abberline, the officer investigating the murders. Although the real Abberline was one of Scotland Yard's most brilliant detectives, he was unable to solve the Ripper case; in the film he eventually uncovers the truth, but is prevented from speaking out by his superior Sir Charles Warren, who is party to the conspiracy, and by fears for his own safety. He is played by Johnny Depp with a Cockney accent which has been criticised by some. I myself found it quite convincing, even though the real Abberline was not actually a Cockney but a native of Dorset who would have spoken with a West Country burr. I will not, however, claim this as a goof because the Depp and the film-makers were clearly not aiming at a portrayal of a real historical individual. I doubt if the real Abberline, unlike the character portrayed here, was an absinth-drinking, opium-addicted dandy who relied on the visions he saw in drug-induced trances to solve crimes. (Not a method of detection recommended in the police manual).The other main character is Mary Kelly, the prostitute who in reality was the Ripper's final victim. As played by Heather Graham, Mary is a stunningly beautiful redhead who looks more like a princess from a Pre-Raphaelite painting than a streetwalker in a London slum. (The ""Jack the Ripper"" TV series also made Mary, there played by Lysette Anthony, unfeasibly glamorous). But then, her function in the film is not as a victim- in this unhistorical version she survives when Gull kills another prostitute he has mistaken for her- but as Abberline's love-interest, and it is an unwritten law of Hollywood that a handsome leading man like Depp can never fall for an unattractive girl.Graham never struck me as remotely convincing, and Ian Holm as Gull never seems clear whether he is playing a cold, calculating hit-man or a homicidal maniac. (Gull was originally to have been played by Nigel Hawthorne, but he had to withdraw of health reasons). I quite liked Depp, however, and there are good supporting performances from Ian Richardson as Warren and Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley, the Watson to Abberline's Holmes. (The real Abberline did indeed have an assistant named Godley, but his Christian name was George, not Peter).As is often the case with films based on graphic novels, the visual style is very lurid and hectic, not really to my taste although some might think it appropriate to a film about this particular subject. What I most disliked about the film, however, was the assumptions upon which it was based. Although we do not know the Ripper's identity, there can be no doubt that these crimes were the work of a deranged lone psychopath ""From Hell"" is the sort of film which will appeal to anyone who refuses to admit this, believing that every great crime must be the work of some ruthless group of conspirators, prepared to orchestrate any sort of mayhem if it suits their mysterious but sinister purposes. Freemasons, of course, along with Jews, have been frequent targets of this sort of conspiracy theory, and Stephen Knight had a particular obsession with Freemasonry. This is a film which, because it targets the Royal Family, tries to pass itself off as free-thinking, radical and anti-Establishment, but which in reality helps to create an atmosphere of fear and suspicion and panders to prejudice and paranoia. 5/10",From Hell

28,=G=,More of a curiosity than a conquest,7,15 May 2002,"""From Hell"", yet another ""Jack the Ripper"" flick, is somewhat over wrought with lavish cinematography imbuing what we'd like to believe is a bleak and dank Whitechapel District of London with richness; a street whore protagonist (Graham) somehow insulting in her sweetness; and a Scotland Yard sleuth (Depp) uncharacteristically dashing considering his beginning and his end. In spite of these and many other foibles, the Hughes bros and company have breathed life into the old and moldy ""Ripper"" lore with a film which propagates still another hypothesis, a somewhat interesting and entertaining story though more of a curiosity and a conquest.

29,MovieAddict2016,"Interesting spin on the tale, if not particularly memorable",6,26 April 2005,"""From Hell"" is an interesting spin on the familiar Jack the Ripper tale, using the iconic cultural image of the cloaked man with the top hat as the source for a spin-off not of history, but of a graphic novel.The lead performance by Johnny Depp as Inspector Abberline (who really existed in 1888 at the time of the murders and really was an authority on the case) is wonderful. Depp nails the cockney accent perfectly. Unfortunately, Heather Graham -- as the prostitute Mary Kelley -- is not as fortunate. Although her accent seems to improve throughout the film at various intervals, for most of ""From Hell's"" duration her British voice is quite stiff and the American twang is audible. The Hughes Brothers did not choose Graham for her acting abilities.That said, the set design on this production is magnificent. 1880s London is brought to life and Whitechapel has never looked more realistic. The film is an odd hybrid of genres because it maintains the look and feel of a slasher film whilst presenting historical elements and painstaking recreations of actual murders. Robbie Coltrane, as one of the police officers involved in the case, has a lot of fun with his character and is fun to watch, and similarly as convincing as the scenery.This is a very gritty and gory film -- more so than I ever expected. It's quite a strange beast with hallucinogenic visuals, horror elements and history thrown in for good measure, on top of some slightly modernized techniques. All in all this film kept me entertained because it was unique, and very different, and not particularly because it was ""great."" I didn't expect a whole lot, but I felt that the movie was directed as ably as it could (or should) have been and the performance by Johnny Depp was deserving of a better film. The ending got a bit carried away, but it still presents a pretty cool twist on the whole Jack the Ripper scenario without totally insulting the intelligence or even upsetting one's sense of history. (Like Disney's ""Pocahontas."") The respect the filmmakers have for their material shines through and elevates this above what it could have been. Definitely worth seeing, if only for its originality.",From Hell

31,sol1218,Ripping his way into the pages of history,7,25 July 2009,"(There are Spoilers)The film ""From Hell"" is not as far out as you may have at first thought in who the infamous ""Jack the Ripper"" really was. As Scotland Yard Inspector Fredrick Abberline, Johnny Depp, at first suspected the ""Ripper"" was not just your garden verity psycho killer but a man highly educated in both medicine and the human anatomy: A highly trained and respected doctor surgeon! It's this theory alone that's to eventually lead Inspector Abberline straight to the very base of power of the mighty 19th Century British Empire! Queen Victoria's, Liz Moscrop, Buckingham Palace!High on opium, that was legal at the time, Inspector Abberline could sense things as a police detective that his fellow members of Scotland Yard couldn't. It was that extrasensory perception on Abberline's part that had him see the real reasons for the notorious ""Ripper"" murders. It was also his addiction to opium that in the end did Abberline in before he could brake the ""Ripper"" case wide open.Classic Gothic Horror movie that takes a number of real historical as well as mysterious incidents, the ""Jack the Ripper murders"", and makes some sense of them. We do get to see,like Inspector Abberline, the real clues to the ""Ripper"" identity and, which are far more important, who he was actually working for. The ""Ripper"", in what the movie brought out, was not an ordinary killer emigrant and illiterate, in the English language, Jew from Czarist Russia or even an escaped lunatic from a mental institution. He was a very highly educated man who did his ghastly job of murder and dismemberment with a skill that would have taken years of practice at a major big city medical facility to achieve!Starting out with a blood-red sunset over the city of London's-circa 1888-crime ridden Whitechapel and Kensington Districts the film ""From Hell"" accurately chronicles the murderous ""Jack the Ripper"" rampage that terrorized London that fateful late summer and fall of 1888. We get to see how the ""Ripper's"" murder of local prostitutes was not an act of murderous insanity but a well thought out plan, by those who controlled him, to rid any evidence connecting his victims, or one of them, to the British Royal Family.***SPOILERS*** In the end it was Inspector Abberline's bulldog-like determination that turned his superior at Scotland Yard Sir. Charles Warner, Ian Richardson, against him. Not that Abberline wasn't doing his job but, in exposing the reasons for the ""Ripper"" killing, doing it far too well then he, and the power behind the British Throne, would have liked him to! Even though Mary Kelly, Heather Graham, is shown at the end of the film to have survived ""Jack the Ripper's"" reign of terror she in fact was, as we saw earlier, the ""Ripper's"" last and most shockingly dismembered murder victim!

32,paul2001sw-1,Ugly beautiful,6,29 June 2005,"Adapted from a comic book, The Hughes' brothers film 'From Hell' is arguably more faithful to its origins than any other of its type. That is to say, the whole movie unfolds like a series of storyboards, the scenes may technically be animated but you can mentally crystallise each one into a handful of definitive images. Darkly Gothic, ultra-violent yet also quiet, the film has also a very well defined aesthetic sense, one arguably more pervasive than that in any of the movies of Tim Burton (with which some stylistic comparison can be made, although 'From Hell', unlike Burton's movies, is utterly lacking in whimsy). It also has a stellar British cast (Ian Holm is especially good value) supporting its leading (American) actors; who, sadly, cannot quite manage the cockney accent as required. Moreover, the usually charismatic Johnny Depp for once fails to leave sufficient impression, and his double act with sidekick Robbie Coltrane is surprisingly lacking in fire on both sides. Additionally, a little of the dialogue is anachronistic or just plain odd. Overall, 'From Hell' doesn't really add up to more than series of pictures, some are individually horrific but there's no wider sense of terror beyond the individual moments of gore. Perhaps it should have stayed as a comic book (as such, it would have at least the elegance of economy); but no-one can deny that the translation is beautifully done.",From Hell

Word is out that the film authors will join the Cohens and the Tavianis in the gallery of great brother directing couples.

And it goes ... BUT this is nonetheless a great performance.And that is the catch. To this reviewer,the films of Depp are somewhat of a cipher. We tend to associate him with some of his most overblown roles -- such the pirate, the boy with scissors for hands, and so on.We do this because he creates the characters so effectively. So effortlessly.But what even his most die-hard fans tend to overlook is that he creates the overblown characters so well because at his core Depp is one of the greatest living actors of our age. He simply hides it too well.What this film offers, aside from a mood and setting to die for, is a real chance to Depp to show what he can do in a serious part ... and he sells it like pumpkins at Holloween.For this reason, as a missing puzzle piece in the archive of his work, I think it deserves special merit.",From Hell
35,ironhorse_iv,"If you dislike this movie. Then, don't know Jack! In my opinion, From Hell is a killer horror movie, even with its flaws!",7,23 August 2016,"During the fall of 1888, a series of five brutal murders shocks Victorian London. The victims, all poor female prostitutes, are murdered and then mutilated, by an unidentified serial killer, only known to the public, as Jack the Ripper. It became known as the White Chapel Murders. Ever since then, the unsolved mystery of the identity of the killer has been intrigue, both historians, scholars, and normal people for over a century now. It seems like everybody has a theory on who is the killer. One of those people, was writer Alan Moore. Taking its name from a letter, supposedly sent by the killer to the White Chapel Vigilance Committee, Alan Moore wrote the graphic novel 'From Hell' from 1989 to 1996 with cartoonist, Eddie Campbell. He wrote that the murders were part of a conspiracy to conceal the birth of an illegitimate royal baby fathered by then-Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (Mark Dexter). While, this plot sound realistic interesting. It's fictional as hell. Also, their 'Royal Conspiracy' theory wasn't that original. In truth, the 'Royal Conspiracy"" theory, was taken from author, Stephen Knight's 1976's 'Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution' book. Unfortunately, this book is not a historically accurate one. It's riddled with historical errors, coincidences, and fabrications. Like the book, the film doesn't know that in real life, that the royal scandal was more about the prince's hidden homosexual than his fathering of an illegitimate son. Nor did they knew that the Freemasons at the time was nearly powerless, due to the height of anti-masonry due to mobile economically during the Industrial Revolution, plus the weakening of longstanding family and community ties. It doesn't help, that film directed by the Hughes Brother is only a loose adaptation of the comic, often taking a different approach. While, I did like the building on the mystery & allowing the police inspector, Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) to be the main character. Others things about the film kinda irritate me. I hate that the huge changes, involving the character of painter, Walter Sickert (Max Dexter). The idea that Sickert and the Prince are the same person is a bit much. Very off-putting, seeing how way different, these two men were in real-life. Plus, the killer's depth is reduced and much of the sophistical themes were also lost. Another thing, the idea of mixing the two characters of Inspector Frederick Abberline with fraudulent psychic, Robert James Lees into one, was a bit jarring. It doesn't make sense that he would be the head of the police department with such clairvoyant views. Another thing, the radical changes to Abberline from an older, gritty overweight conservative detective to a young drug addict inspector was just as puzzling. What type of police would allow a known-opium user to be the head of it!? I have to say; while Johnny Depp is a fine actor, and was alright in the role; I thought, his on-screen American Boy Scout good-looks and lack of British accent was a bit distracting. Also, the force love story between him and the lead prostitute, Mary Kelley (Heather Graham) was just as improbably. Heather Graham is alright, but it's nothing to write about. The supporting cast is also great, the women that play the victims, were memorable, however, it's Ian Holms as Sir William Gull & Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley that steals the movie, even if they were a bit hammy. From Hell is also one of the most beautifully atmospheric and visually gruesome period films about that era. In many ways, the film was very true to life, particularly in its recreation of Whitechapel and its portrayal of the everyday lives of its inhabitants. I really did felt like I step back into the haunting, yet wonderful world of Victorian England. It's so authentic. I even like the cameo of the Elephant Man, himself; John Merrick (Anthony Parker). The make-up work is also decent. I like how well, the gore effects look. The music of Trevor Jones was just as haunting. Overall: While, this movie does have some faults, it really didn't hurt the film, too much. I still somewhat enjoy the film. I have to say, the movie wasn't as predictable as some critics think it is. While, the order and names of the victims are well-known, the film still have time to show some twist and turns with the story. Yet, the film should certainly not be viewed as an authentic representation of the Ripper crimes as a whole. Still, the film serves as a good introduction to new viewers to the case and bring a new unique spin to those who know its history. It's fictional as hell, but entertaining.",From Hell

Depp is in top form, Robbie Coltrane is always reliable, Ian Holm hams it up brilliantly and the under rated Paul Rhys is as solid as ever. That man should have had a much bigger career. If there is one criticism of the cast it is Heather Graham. Ignoring her accent, she is simply too attractive!! I can't imagine a single punter who would pay for sex with any of the other prostitutes, when Graham's Mary Kelly was about!! Dark, brooding and full of intense atmosphere, I usually revisit this every couple of years.

37,sol-,Don't Know Jack,4,25 March 2017,"Hoping to uncover the motives of Jack the Ripper, a London policeman enlists the help of a prostitute of this fanciful take on the historical murderer whose identity remains a mystery still today. The film is atmospherically shot by the reliable Peter Deming and there are some neat stylistic touches such as time lapse night to day sequence as the police discover one victim's body. Generally speaking though, this is a bit of a lacklustre affair. The film's explanation of the Ripper murders as a part of an elaborate conspiracy to hush local prostitutes never quite rings true. It is almost fascinatingly twisted enough for the lack of credibility not to matter, however, the fact that Johnny Depp's protagonist uncovers the conspiracy through clairvoyance and intuition rather than actual detective work makes it hard to buy into. Imagine if Kevin Costner's character in 'JFK' used his dreams to argue against Lee Harvey Oswald acting alone and you would not be far off. The film is additionally cheapened by a romance developing between Depp and Heather Graham, cast as the prostitute who helps him. Not only does their romance do little to further the tale, the pair have few sparks between them, with each balancing Victorian accents not helping matters in the slightest. Small moments of 'From Hell' certainly work, such as Joseph Merrick making an unexpected appearance and the coins on the eyes myth, but as far as Jack the Ripper stories are concerned, 'Time After Time' and 'Murder by Decree' are far preferable motion pictures.",From Hell

I also liked the interpretations of Johnny Depp's who played as Inspector Frederick Abberline and he was very good at it, Robbie Coltrane's who played as Sergeant Peter Godley and Ian Holm who played as Sir William Gull and he was simply amazing. Another thing that has to be mentioned is the direction which was made by Albert and Allen Hughes (as The Hughes Brothers) and I believe they did an excellent job.To sum up, I have to say that ""From Hell"" is a good movie with an interesting plot and some clever plot twists, it has also many good scenes that combine mystery and make you feel that you are there too. I recommend everyone to watch this movie and especially if you are a fan of mystery movies because I believe that you are going to enjoy it very much.",From Hell

The film plays with this situation to show us one of the most famous theories about the killer's identity: that would be a figure of British royalty or someone close to the ruling circles. The film also shows us the misery and poverty in which the lower classes of London lived, in a time when being poor often meant to live in the limits of the law to survive, and numb the pain of life in abuse of drugs or alcohol. Depp plays one of the inspectors highlighted by Scotland Yard to investigate and arrest the mysterious killer, who only kills prostitutes but that is so fierce and so meticulously bloody that quickly spread terror through the streets of Whitechapell. The actor shone in the role, managing to give the character a contradictory personality, spread in their desire to do justice, in the way he falls in love and in the addictions he feeds.A film recommended for all who enjoy a good cop movie, with a minimum expenditure of bullets and bloodshed.",From Hell
41,leplatypus,What the hell (TV),1,12 May 2010,"I watched it on screen at its release and remember having troubles to follow the story and explain the motive behind the murders.Now, I decided to have a second look because I just finished to read the big comics of Moore and Campbell. And I realized how this movie sucks! It's absolutely not an adaptation of the comics but a failed variation on it. So exit some brilliant ideas (the mystic London, the ingenious plot, the royal family scandal, the scapegoat, the false clairvoyant, ...) and welcome stupid innovations (the stoned detective, the Spanish doctor, ). I am sure that if they could, they would have changed London for New York and replaced the ripper by a butcher! Now, the beginning of the movie and the murders appear more stupid than my first viewing! In addition, the sets look cheap and really pasteboard and the cast is really funny: all the hookers are ugly except Heather Graham who wears a ridiculous red hairstyle!

The settings are simply great and truly resemble the England of that time.In the Horror aspect, the movie has great gore and violence. I dug the unrated version. The fact that the Elephant Man does a cameo is a great moment in the movie.I cannot comment that much on this one because it has to be watched objectively and do not associate it 100% with the serial killer we all know.

This anamorphically shot Victorian- era serial killer drama is a vivid, atmospheric work by the talented Hughes Brothers, who certainly made quite a departure from their prior string of films which included Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp.Though maybe not quite as enthralling in this as Ian Holm, Johnny Depp is creative and becoming as an opium-addicted widowed inspector whose drug-induced dreams generate clairvoyant insights into investigations. The resonance of Sherlock Holmes, another fan of the pipe, is instantly recognizable, and Al and Allen Hughes's drastic departure from 'hood tragedies provides its hero with a pushy assistant in played by Robbie Coltraine, a policeman sent to heave Depp out of the opium dens and jog his memory of his duty.Drawing a fairly dark performance even from Heather Graham, this movie is murky, dank and exhilaratingly so. The movie almost feels devious or illicit. There's a remarkable shot that begins with the city of London, cranks down past towers and trains, and plummets into a cavernous cellar where a Masonic group is sitting in judgment of one of its affiliates. You are stricken with the conception of the vigorous physical evolution of the historical metropolitan area, and the underground mechanisms of the Establishment. In an era when social morals were severe and pitiless, mischief behind closed doors was a flourishing, hot-blooded activity. Countless, maybe all, wealthy and respectable men took part in secret sin.The Hughes Brothers dive headlong into this universe, so far from their native roots and previous subject matter, embellishing and invigorating everything they depict. Their source material is graphic novel by Alan Moore, and some of their extravagant black-and-red cinematography feels influenced by modern comic book illustration, with its angry slants and angles and overstated vantage points. The production design targets garish settings, dripping wet color schemes, bottomless shadows, all painting a lavish picture of an 1880s world of subterranean corners and locales protected by the utmost evil of power and corruption.Watching the movie, I am astounded by how reliably it takes you surprise. Its charm is that it doesn't seem to cater to any particular target audience. Its comic book origins may suggest a younger male audience, but its history, as well as its use of drama much more than violence, doesn't seem made for the same folks, though its gushing blood and, literally, guts, certainly do. It is its own beast, perhaps more in the tradition of HushHush, Sweet Charlotte with a touch of surreality about a side view of an utterly nasty society, dishonored with a trickle- down effect of debauchery and ruthless self-preservation.",From Hell

The depiction of the working class in turn of the century London adequately depicts the use of absinthe, opium, and wanton harlotry; from both angles of the later. I found this movie to be beautifully filmed, creatively directed and written from an inspired angle. And, while I do have a problem with the depiction of London streets as clean, freshly-washed cobblestones, I still thought the rendition of the city was quite remarkable and had great bearing on this almost Burton/Ridley Scott-esquire feature film.This story is believably portrayed by all involved, and is a brilliant introduction to those with little knowledge of the Jack the Ripper story. For those of us who have had some knowledge of this time-honored walking human disease, it was a beautiful and compelling work of art.

He is an unusual sort who has ""visions"" while under the influence of opium. In fact we first meet him when his assistant Sgt. Godley (Robbie Coltrane) fetches him out of an opium den.

Among the ""ladies"" is Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) with whom he eventually falls in love. Abberline seeks help from famous surgeon (Ian Holm) who explains the technical aspects of the murders. Thwarting him for apparent political reasons is his superior (Ian Richardson). There are enough of twists and turns in the plot to hold the viewer's interest.

Anyone who has read at least one recent JtR related book will have to many problems with the plot and setup of this film to really enjoy the mood, violence, and STUPID MTV STYLE Camera-work. Johnny Depp is an opium smoking drink/drunk copper with a Robbie Coltrane sidekick out to kick the Ripper's a**, but his superiors don't really care about who is killing the hookers of Whitechapel. Thankfully Johnny does, but he takes a long time in tracking down the killer, and by that time everyone is dead anyway (kind of)...in fact he doesn't really catch the killer either. My problem is that there are too many liberties taken with the actual story. For a start, all the prostitutes know each other. They are all pals. Yep - all the victims are pals, and therefore in being together provide the killer with a motive for doing them all in. Think masonic rituals and Prince Albert and illegitimate children and such like. (AND - what happened to the child's mother? She didn't get knifed. And to be honest the hookers really didn't have a clue what was going on and therefore didn't really have to die) Another quibble - These days it's reckoned that the killer was that American fella and not the royal surgeon fella, but in this film it is the royal surgeon fella, who is a mason and hired to kill the prozzies (all that crap above about children and such like)... It's like they decided to tweak the story and ended up getting too carried away. We get a love story between Mary Kelly (Graham -who has got red hair just in case we don't she's meant to be Irish or something) and Depp. Kelly doesn't even get killed apparentley - it some other chick (err so that's meant to be okay). And Depp dies. Can't remember any of that happening even in the wildest books about the Whitechapel Murders. The film is enjoyable if you don't sit taking pot shots at it, but does tend to go a bit mad in the old cinematography department (flashing lights, split second shots and such like). The last murder is rather gory (not as bad as it really was though...urgh), Depp and Holm are good, but it's just too far fetched for my liking.Average.",From Hell
48,dfranzen70,"Not a hot film, not a cold one.... From Limbo",5,27 May 2002,"A clarvoyant inspector works on the famed Jack the Ripper murder cases in Victorian era London. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) can best be described as troubled, as he is haunted both by his own psychic abilities and his dependence on absinthe. As destitute prostitutes are murdered and eviscerated, disemboweled, and worse on the streets of the extremely poor Whitechapel section of the city, Abberline tries to discern the culprit - it's a learned man, he concludes, one with a distinct knowledge of medicine. Smart lad, that. As Abberline becomes more and more involved with the case, he also becomes more involved with one prostitute in particular whose group seems to have been targeted, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). From the start, one can tell that Mary and Abberline will hook up, because she is the only prostitute who does not look downtrodden and, well, like a bucket of mud. (As a point of fact, love interests never look like buckets of mud, unless the story is about a cure for looking like a bucket of mud, or something.)
At any rate, as Abberline investigates further, he runs into his ultraconservative, image-conscious boss, who even asks him to destroy evidence and suspends him (how come so few police chiefs and the like actually act in concert with their detectives and officers on the screen? How come the cop has to go beyond regulations to get at the truth?). Abberline does have the help of his colleague Peter Godley (the always-reliable Robbie Coltrane), but in general he's on his own. Can he solve the crimes?Depp attempts to disappear into the role, and for the most part he succeeds, right down to what sounds to me like an authentic Cockney accent (but what do I know?). The problem is, the story's weak, and when the lead actor's just trying to blend in, the movie comes off as rather pedestrian. In other words, folks, you've already seen this movie in one form or another. There are some twists, but they're minor ones. It's a rainy, cold, dark, dreary movie, much like I imagine London itself was back then (and perhaps still is, at times). There's simply not much unique with this movie, and it could have been just as well done with lesser-known stars. Graham, in particular, is wasted here - she's a fine actress, but she's left to do little more than be a victim.  In addition, the ending is pretty unsatisfying, although the killer is named.",From Hell

So it's only a movie,then,not a history lesson.Obviously a lot of money has been spent and the net result is quite compelling,its whole being rather better than the sum of its parts. I think the fact that it's derived from a comic book should have alerted most people that the characters might not be very,er,believable.

50,drqshadow-reviews,"Busy and Distracted, From Hell Tries Too Much and Accomplishes Too Little",4,27 October 2020,"Coal-soaked skies and grime-caked slums serve as backdrop to this dark, grisly nineteenth century chase; Johnny Depp, unconventional police detective, in tireless pursuit of Jack the Ripper through Victorian London's back alleys. Frolicking in filth, From Hell takes delight in sharing as much century-old depravity as it can dream up. Unkempt taverns, dimly-lit opium dens, malevolent secret societies, illicit after-hours transactions, morally-dubious medical experiments... we're constantly drenched in dirty material. Which sets quite a mood, fitting for the proximity of one so notorious as Jack, but also straps the viewer with a heavily crowded plot. There's just too much going on, too many surface-scratched subplots that don't amount to much of anything, while the hook (oh yes, we're hunting a faceless mass-murderer) gets bogged down and overlooked, kicked like a tin can down the road.Depp's role is rather reserved by his usual standards: a hazy, somnambulant drug addict who desperately lopes from one bloody crime scene to the next. While our detective trips, in a series of tonally discordant hallucination scenes that smack of late '90s film trends, he catches foggy premonitions that prod him toward his next big break. It's all rather silly, really, a shoehorned mystical slant that is (somewhat ironically) addressed, scoffed at and discarded in Alan Moore's phone book-sized original graphic novel.There's something good buried here, between the accurate reproduction of essential locales and the eternally-intriguing subject matter, but it's ultimately left unearthed.

This only serves to undermine the horrific events, and as a result the movie is never once frightening despite copious amounts of gore.

53,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Vibrant, gorgeous horror",8,30 August 2015,"The Hugh's Brothers From Hell may play havoc with the facts of the actual Jack the Ripper case, and sometimes veers into syrupy sentiment, but for the most part it's a sumptuous, wonderfully spooky shocker with an austere, gloom and doom vibe and some genuinely horrifying murder scenes. I consider it a companion piece to Sleepy Hollow, as they both positively drip with atmosphere, and share the same star in Johnny Depp, as a troubled Inspector attempting to solve equally chilling homicides. Granted Sleepy Hollow is the fun one, while From Hell has almost no sense of humour and a sense of grave danger from right out of the gate. Johnny Depp plays Frederick Abberline, an opium addicted Scotland Yard inspector who's roped into an obsessive search for Jack The Ripper, aided by his sergeant Peter Godley (always nice to see Hagrid- I mean Robbie Coltrane). He gets embroiled in aristocratic corruption, and attempts to protect beautiful prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham with red hair!) who fears she may be next on old Jack's list. He begins to suspect that his opium induced nightmares may provide a conduit to the killers actions, and give him something to go on. Is he losing it? Or are the drugs actually giving him metaphysical clues? Depp plays him with a forlorn, world weary malaise that's a nice front for the razor sharp intellect that made Abberline famous (he also took down the Wolfman earlier in life). Bilbo Bagg- I mean Ian Holm shows up as a renowned doctor who assists him, and Jason Flemyng as a no good coach driver, with Sophia Myles, Katrin Kartlidge and David Schofield as a grinning, evil east end pimp rounding out the roster. Now, because in real life it's an unsolved case, the Brother's Hugh's feel like they have to complete full circle, and give us a nice tidy resolution. I feel like the film should have left it open ended and never given us a who in the whodunit. It would have made the film so much more effective and eerie, but alas the studio heads must be babysat through a generic narrative to appease their financial anxiety. No matter, it's still a rich, gorgeous, bloody genre piece with an evocative, smoky London palette for this ghostly predator to stalk and slay, and for hard nosed law dogs to pursue him through the fog.

54,drownnnsoda,"Compelling, Scary, And Well Told.",9,10 July 2007,"""From Hell"" takes place in 1888 in Victorian-era London. In the Whitechapel district of the city, prostitutes begin to be found murdered in the streets, all of them stabbed to death with their throats slashed, and their sexual (and other) organs removed. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), a proclaimed clairvoyant, is assigned to the case, and begins to develop a relationship with Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who is friends with many of the victims. As the prostitutes begin to drop like flies, clues are also dropped at each crime scene, and Abberline's visions of the killer become increasingly violent, as he attempts to unravel the identity of the murderer.A truly chilling and well-made film, ""From Hell"" is a semi-fictional telling of the real-life murders that occurred in London at the turn of the 19th century. The killer referred to himself Jack The Ripper, and while his identity was never revealed, his crimes go down as likely the most infamous serial killing of all time. The script for this movie, adapted from a graphic novel, quite obviously differs from the real historical facts, but it doesn't get too far off track, which is good. Many of the characters actually existed, and some of the events are told like they happened. The pacing here is great as well, and though most modern audiences may find this movie too ""slow"" or ""boring"", the pacing is even, balancing the progression of the story and the shocks well. The movie builds a heap of suspense as it progresses, and the final revelation is satisfying. It's quite a visceral little movie as well, and while most of the violence isn't really seen, it's still quite a gory movie, which I wasn't expecting. The depictions of the murders themselves were particularly disturbing, but also done in a shocking and original manner.Johnny Depp plays our hero, Inspector Abberline, and nails the role perfectly. His authority and intelligence emanates on screen, and he plays the role very believably (although his English accent may be a little off, I won't nitpick though). Heather Graham turns in a great performance as well, even though she's playing the clichéd ""hooker with a heart of gold"" who finds herself and her friends in a very scary situation. Another thing that should be noted about this movie is it's amazing set design and cinematography - the gritty, lamp-lit cobblestone streets of downtown London are presented perfectly here, and the atmosphere is very Gothic and quite spooky. There is also quite a few great visuals (some of them a bit hallucinogenic, but very interesting), as well as some very clever and well-executed camera tricks. The entire picture really looks stunning. The ending was a bit of a downer, but I really didn't have a problem with that either.All things considered, ""From Hell"" is an exceptional horror/thriller that is stylish, very well told, and quite scary. If the Jack The Ripper case is of any interest to you, or if you are just a fan of horror movies (particularly period pieces), I'd advise you to take a look at this movie, because it is an excellent and entertaining (albeit somewhat fictionalized) telling of those infamous crimes. 9/10.",From Hell

The film evinces the streets, dark and dank 'doss houses', and the wretched lives on the East End of Whitechapel. It's not glamorized, it was a slum (I have visited London and Mitre Square, while now surrounded by business and banks, is indeed a sad parking area,and a tourist sign still demarcates the victim who was found there.There are several theories hinted at here, Sir William Gull (excellently portrayed by Ian Holm) the physician to Queen Victoria and her grandson, who was afflicted with a social disease. Sir William was an experienced surgeon and also a Freemason. The Masonic Lodge plays into theories here as well, as the area where several female victims were found mutilated was close by.However, there are other theories also.The visuals of this film are noteworthy. The red sky and Westminter Chapel, the cold brutality of winters in an era of workhouses and little options for the impoverished.While not a solution to the mystery (we may never have one), Depp , Holm and the performance of Heather Graham as Irish street walker and victim ""Mary Kelly"" is worth watching. You will get a feel for the era.Sir Ian Holm, as he teaches an anatomy class and states : ""the heart is a stubborn muscle, like mahogany, it is almost impossible to burn"", as we see the visual in his mind of throwing a victims heart into the boiling kettle in his fireplace.It is a pastiche of events, but does give one a sense of the murders, and what life must have felt like for those who were not born into royalty in Victorian England.

At a loss to explain or prevent the murders, Abberline is taunted by letters and clues from the killer, whom the papers have dubbed Jack The Ripper ...The Hughes Brothers are unlikely candidates to direct a Victorian Gothic drama, but their film is an excellent mix of style, authentic atmosphere and entertaining mystery. It starts a little shakily, introducing too many odd characters too quickly, but soon settles into a dark, chilling depiction of the notorious Whitechapel Murderer. Its trump card is the fantastic production design (shot in Prague) by Martin Childs; a sprawl of dank, grimy East End cobbled streets and alleys, pubs and flophouses, all backlit by fabulous matte paintings by Syd Dutton and Bill Taylor. It's a living, breathing, nineteenth-century slum and it transports us to the world of the story. The problem with a movie about unsolved crimes of course is that it has to give us an answer; this film goes for one of the much-disputed conspiracy theories that the Duke of Clarence (Queen Victoria's grandson and second in line to the throne) had a legitimate child with a Catholic streetwalker, and that Sir William Gull (his physician) lobotomised the mother and killed anyone who had witnessed the marriage (other popular but unlikely theories are that the killer was the Duke himself, or a painter called Walter Sickert). The script weaves an entertaining yarn around these ideas, filled with secret masonic rituals and dastardly deeds, but it also goes a bit loopy in parts, throwing in bizarre developments (the most famous victim, Mary Kelly, escapes) and tenuous links to Queen Victoria and John Merrick. The central linking concept - that the victims all knew each other - is almost certainly false, but the locales and the details of the killings are painstakingly recreated. The movie nicely captures the tension of the time between the nobility and the deprived; the notion that the authorities did little to find the killer because who cares about a few less tarts in the world anyway ? Of all the Dickensian hardships foisted on the poor, Jack The Ripper represents the cruellest injustice. The cast are varied but good, with Depp (a Ripper fanatic by all accounts) impressive as the laudanum and absinthe-soaked Abberline, complete with a great ""nuffing sahgint"" accent, Graham memorable as the tenacious, fiery-haired Mary, and Coltrane solid support as the world-weary, Bard-quoting sergeant. I have mixed feelings about Holm's performance; he's one of my favourite actors (superb in Alien, Dreamchild, Brazil, many others) and is excellent in this, but he's seventy and five-feet-six, so I'm afraid he doesn't quite work as Jack The Ripper for me, despite some spooky pitch-black lenses. Compare him with David Warner in Time After Time for example, who is perfect casting as the original serial killer. For a good comparison piece to this, check out the 1988 TV-movie Jack The Ripper, with Michael Caine and Lewis Collins. Despite some flaws, this is a great costumed thriller; the title comes from the signature on one of Jack's infamous letters.",From Hell

Our disc in the store was damaged, they thought it was fixed so I took it home to test it. It still didn't work, so it wasn't until now that I saw it all the way through. Jaime had never seen it either and as a Depp fan, she wanted to. We sat down to watch it as I needed to see if for the Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s that I'm doing over on The Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis here is in Victorian-era London, a troubled clairvoyant police detective investigates the murders of Jack the Ripper.We're in London in the year 1888. The movie presents us with a group of prostitutes of Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), Dark Annie Chapman (Katrin Cartlidge), Liz Stride (Susan Lynch), Kate Eddowes (Lesley Sharp), Polly Nichols (Annabelle Apsion) and Martha Tabram (Samantha Spiro). Something I want to point out here is that this is a rough life. There weren't a lot of prospects and these women are doing what they can to survive. To make it more difficult, McQueen (David Schofield) along with one of his men from the Nichols Street Gang tell the women they owe each owe a pound for protection. This group has another friend of Ann Crook (Joanna Page). She has a newborn baby and asks them to watch her for awhile so she can see her husband, Albert Sickert (Mark Dexter). They tell her about their run-in and they can't do today. Ann tells them if they do, she will get Albert to pay what is owed.Things take a turn though when Albert and her are making love, but they're interrupted. Benjamin Kidney (Terence Harvey) along with his secret police takes the two into custody. Mary sees what happens and they don't understand what is going on. They just know it can't be good. They decide to take her child to Ann's parents as they regroup.Martha is then murdered that night. It is a brutal one where her labia are removed. This causes Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to seek out Inspector Frederick Abberline (Depp) from an opium den. After getting him sobered up as best as he can, they go to the crime scene. Frederick is known to have visions that help him solve cases. Many are skeptical to trust them, but he does get results.Soon after, Polly is murdered. The imaginary is great as she is staring at an obelisk and we were someone speaking softly in verse. Frederick picks up almost immediately that there are two different killers. His investigation brings him and Sgt Godley to Mary and her friends. At first they don't want to talk, but they tell them about the Nichols Gang along with their threat. Sgt Godley doesn't necessarily believe it. There is a much bigger plot of what is going on here. It would cause a scandal as it leads Frederick to Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician to the monarch, Dr. Ferral (Paul Rhys) who is a young promising surgeon that was accepted into the Freemasons and the true identity of Albert. The question though, who is Jack the Ripper and why is he targeting these specific prostitutes?That's where I want to leave my recap of the movie as I'm trying to give as much background to get you up to speed if you've not seen this or you haven't for some time. I should also include here that I've read the graphic novel and much like this movie, there's a lot of information that is given to us.While watching this, I tried my best to not spoil things to Jaime while giving her some of the insight that I had into the case here. That is something that I really want to give credit to Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias in bringing to life the graphic novel from Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. I should also mention The Hughes Brothers as the directors with what I'm going to shift to now. There is a lot of real, factual information that was put into the From Hell graphic novel to the point where it is historically accurate. It is stated there are liberties taken to make it more interesting though. I think this movie does a really good at bringing that to life. I read that many of the crime scenes were made to match and I recall a sequence at the climax straight from the graphic novel. There is so much time and care taken into this, I have to give credit.Even though not all of this is factual, I could see some of this being real. The movie does an excellent job of the setting with Victorian-era London. It feels and looks dirty. How hard of a life it is for these women to survive is another aspect there. Going along with this, we see that everyone looks down on the prostitutes who are just trying to survive, even though many will frequent them when they need to. It isn't surprising that Burke and Hare could make a living like they did or that there would be cover-ups involving the police. It makes it even more believable when you have a group like the Freemasons that find their roots from the Knights Templar. I'm not saying that's the truth of what really happened here, but you could see how it could for sure.Before I go down a rabbit hole, I think we have some interesting characters. I don't remember Frederick being like he is in this movie in the graphic novel. I think that Depp plays the role really well though. He just has that charismatic nature and quirky enough that I could see him using the drugs that he is. On top of that, he's hurting. There have been a lot of bad cards dealt his way and he really just wants to help these women. Graham is quite attractive and I think she's fine in this performance. Holm is really good in his role along with Coltrane, Jason Flemyng as the coachman Netley and the rest of the cast in my opinion.Where I want to take this next would be the effects. What was really surprising to me is how brutal this movie gets at times. There is a cutting of a throat scene that I remember and just hearing about how these women are killed is quite horrific as well. Most of the deaths are off-screen, that is something to keep in mind, but we do get to glimpses of the aftermath. It works in a way where my imagination is allowed to fill things in. I've already spoken about the setting of the movie so aside from that, the cinematography does some interesting things that worked for me. I give credit there for sure and they did an excellent job on top of that making this feel like London of the era. It isn't as good as some of the films of the past did with making it a character, but I could believe we are seeing events from then.That's where I think I'm going to leave this review. It is an excellent adaptation from the source material. I wanted to be vague to not spoil things, even though I'm not entirely sure this is how the graphic novel ended. It is also tough in that we truly don't know who Jack the Ripper is. There's an interesting mystery of this movie and I think moves at a good pace. I never get bored despite its two hour runtime which is good. The acting really brings these characters to life, shout-outs to Depp and Holm for sure. The effects were really good and I think that soundtrack fit for what was needed. If I did have issues, it was hard to figure out who some of the characters were. Other than that though, this is a really good movie in my opinion.",From Hell
61,onepotato2,"yeah, maybe.",4,26 December 2007,"This movie got unusually mean reviews. It is an average movie - it deserves neither scorn, nor adulation. I enjoyed it but it doesn't offer too much that would cause me to watch it again. It's a reasonable effort.Instead of altering the Ripper case willy-nilly to suit their needs, only small changes have been made (they dismiss all but one Ripper letter). So it was nice to see the actual clues of the case appear and be assembled into a coherent storyline; even though the Prince Edward explanation has been discredited. The envisioning of Victorian London is fresh, and the film technique which suggests the passing of time over crime scenes is fine. So it ends up being less dumb than I imagined. Jack the Ripper is wearing the wrong hat though. (Witnesses describe a man in a deerstalker cap, not an opera-style top-hat)Heather Graham is a strange piece of casting for a role that requires a decent accent, and the revisions to Victorian culture itself are absurd. The culture is depicted as having very contemporary, relaxed morals: Annie is a whore; you don't sit in a garden, or visit the Victoria and Albert museum with a whore in 1888. And you just aren't seen in public with anyone but your wife, or there's a scandal. Oh, Mary can read!? Unlikely. Mary has improbable middle-class values and behavior. She'd more likely be a nasty, unwashed, ignorant, uncultured, drunk, prematurely-aging guttersnipe; as Ripper's victims were.The lamest part of the movie is that it hints at two or three options for who might be Jack, then selects the culprit you suspected the first second he was introduced (Gee... that was underwhelming!) And the idea that an underground society actually meets underground (!) is um, quaint.After seeing Sweeney Todd for the first time this week, Burtons' effort looks even less original or thoughtful than I previously granted. All he did was glance at this earlier Depp vehicle; borrow the whole production and add the songs. Heather even ends up living ""by the sea!""",From Hell

Heather Graham is able to emote and elevate her role wonderfully, despite it basically being a damsel role.Almost everyone else is old British guy, and it really feels like the complex mystery and drip-fed information investigation is really what makes the movie stand out.Fortunately, despite the movie still being somewhat gruesome, it's not a complete gore-fest, so there is very little to distract from the investigation aspect of the movie except for a ill-found romantic entanglement.",From Hell
63,Easygoer10,Very Good Hughes Brothers Film,8,26 March 2020,"I like this film. Although it is not based in fact, it follows the Jack the Ripper cases as it's primary theme. Although never completely solved, in more recent times, it was narrowed down to 4 suspects. The most likely (to my knowledge) is man who moved from London to New York City. The dates fit the records of this person's passage by ship to New York City. Moreover, this man killed at least 2 more women, and was subsequently executed in New York State. This is still a very good adaptation. The casting is very good. There are some flaws in ""over the top"" responses.

Even some of the camera set-ups and editing are the same.""From Hell"" adds more sex and a little more gore; also, its ending is depressingly negative.However, the original ""Decree"" was also pretty darn depressing. The detective, however brilliant, cannot move the mountains of society through the practice of reason and civility. The rich and the powerful, sick as they are, have some ability to reconstruct the world according to their own psychoses.No doubt. That was why the Plummer-Holmes film is not well remembered, and it is one of the elements in the present film that makes it, too, difficult to watch.""From Hell"", though depressing, is well made; the acting is solid; the mystery elements are handled well - although in place of Holmes' deductive powers, the case is solved more through some kind of magic or ESP (this was very unclear to me). Overall, the level of suspense keeping us watching is maintained.But I confess I am weary that we get these regurgitations presented to us as though they were brand new. In an era when the Government threatens to arrest working-class kids for downloading mp3s, the rich and the powerful seem to be able to bootleg and plagiarize all they choose.Dam' depressing, indeed.",From Hell

(R)Dull, dreary variation on Jack the Ripper's Victorian-era murder spree, with Depp playing an inspector on the case who gets clairvoyant visions in opium dreams (and that's not even the silliest thing going on here). He comes to the aid of Graham (hysterically miscast as a supposedly bedraggled Whitechapel street prostitute) amid a series of gruesome murders while uncovering a bizarre conspiracy involving shadowy, privileged circles of power--anything else the filmmakers wanted to nick from Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow""? Depp seems listless enough for the audience to assume he was ingesting real opium while performing, and his sentimental romance with Graham is all the more creaky and unconvincing surrounded by the grim, Gothic trappings. Said scenery and atmosphere are among the film's few virtues, though the directors can't even get that quite right, as their showy, stylized touches don't embellish mood so much as befuddle motivation.

He goes through the whole film with the same expression, even while ""chasing the dragon"" in the opium dens. Better acting comes from Heather Graham and many things have been said about her being too pretty, but that's not important She is believeable and so is definitely Robbie Coltrane as the police sergeant.Two hours don't appear to be too long.

69,Howlin Wolf,A Classy Chiller...,8,8 March 2002,"What makes ""From Hell"" a classy chiller that's 'a cut above' the rest? Well, a decent script and a handful of fine performances certainly helps. What is actually crucial about the script is not that it is particularly Oscar worthy, but that it never jars the viewer from the timezone that the film is supposed to be set in.  Several other details about Victorian London are very convincing as well.  So, that takes care of the setting, what about the actual mechanics of the story?   It definitely held the interest, but I can't help feeling that the whole experience would have been slightly more satisfying had the makers dealt separately with the two stories of the 'inspired copper' and the 'tart with a heart'.  Leaving aside such pedantic quibbles as these not actually being faithful renderings of real people, the feeble attempt at creating a romance between the two leads does not work.  That said, both are interesting enough to keep the film running smoothly when we encounter them each on their own.   It's definitely 'artistic license' to cast an actress as beautiful as Heather Graham as a 19th century English prostitute, but she does OK, without once threatening to steal the thunder of her more established co-stars.  Depp is as convincing as usual, proving a reliably intense performer on which to hang the bones of the story.  Give the man a part in ""Eastenders""!  Robbie Coltrane is good as usual, playing advisor to Abberline; and Ian Holm can always be relied upon to give good value.  So each member of the cast (whether American or not) seems quite at home in the 'grimy' capital depicted.  Much credit though, must also go to directors The Hughes brothers for making this a thoroughly interesting watch.  They handle their first foray into horror territory well, suggesting a return may not be out of the question.   If you have an idea of what to expect when you sit down to watch, I struggle to see how you could be disappointed.  There are minor flaws to be sure, but not enough to really ruin the 'mood'; and it is the skillfully created atmosphere - contributed to by all - which goes a long way towards making ""From Hell"" one of the best unsettling thrillers to come out in quite a while...",From Hell

71,oneguyrambling,Stylish and visually striking version of fabricated events.,6,5 November 2010,"So let's get this straight, the African-American directing team the Hughes Brothers - fresh off a hot streak including Menace II Society and Dead Presidents decide that their follow up would be an English period dramatic thriller? Well yes it was folks, and to prepare for making their Jack the Ripper flick they watched Bram Stoker's Dracula about a million times, and ripped off almost everything but the plot.There is much poetic license taken here, apparently it is based upon a fictionalised comic book version that I have never heard of, but then realistically I haven't heard about any comic that hasn't already been made into a movie.What I like is that it opens with a quote from good ole Jack himself, considering no-one knows who he is that seems a huge leap of faith.So to summarise The Hughes Brothers' version, Jack is not a random hack'n'slash guy roaming the back streets, but a calculated intelligent and skilled surgeon hell-bent on killing specific targets. In this case a sextet of hookers led by Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham, yup good 'ole Rollergirl herself.Now I've heard that Heather absolutely butchers the English accent in this, but as I am not especially familiar with the particulars of the dialect I can't be sure. As an Australian I can definitely tell when someone is massacring the Oz accent, so I guess the best people to ask would be British locals.Now these hookers owe some seedy guys from the Nicholls Street gang some cash, and more than 6 scrags can make in reasonable time at their trade. The boss of the gang McQueen is hanging around in menacing fashion, basically providing a nice red herring suspect for the early stages.This is sorta the first 10 minutes of the flick, and is real confusing, especially if you aren't paying attention, but in reality it matters not a zack, as aside from showing that the hookers are buddies it means nothing.Shortly after we have the first kill, one of the hookers is found minus some vital lady bits and a fair bit of blood. So we finally get to meet Johnny Depp as Inspector Abaline, and his Sergeant played by Robbie Coltrane.Now a digression: I should hate Johnny Depp, he is pretty, bangs supermodels, is rich, and was famous and cocky when very young. I should hate and boycott Johnny Depp movies just like I hate Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and Hugh Grant. But I don't.Why? I tried to find out why by looking at his IMDb page, and what I came up with was that over his whole career he has never once made a film that was obviously just for the cash. Beside this he has latched on to Tim Burton, one of the most consistently interesting directors over the last 20 odd years, which means every few years he will have a film released that I will likely see.Back to Hell. Aberline is a little bit of an opium addict, and dabbles with other nasties too, so much so that he has visions of what is likely to happen in the future regarding the hookers. Now I drink - often to excess - and even though I am not fortunate enough to have visions (if anything I lose memories I already have) I would think it extremely fortunate to have visions of people I have never met, but will soon.More kills ensue and it's 3 down, 3 to go. Turns out that the hookers, being poor and unfortunate, cannot afford luxuries like fruit, so they are lured to their doom with the temptation of grapes. This works apparently on almost every occasion, so it is obvious too that they are poor, unfortunate and stupid.So Aberline, working on a hunch, goes to meet some noted surgeons in the hope that they could enlighten his theory that an educated and trained man is doing the killing further. There he meets Bilbo Baggins, I mean the Royal surgeon and physician Dr Gull, who confirms and supports his theory.Without delving further and giving away too much there is a key subplot which eventually somewhat clumsily becomes intertwined with the key story, there are cover ups, secret orders and societies, red herrings and short-term suspects and corruption at the highest level. Basically everything a grown boy needs.Ultimately the film unmasks the ""real"" killer, or at least this version's killer, and while it is at least ballsy that they decide to name one guy and come up with a motive and backstory, it does feel very much like a flimsy attempt at a plausible story. There must have been hundreds of leaps of faith taken to piece the thing together from scratch, and if one or two of those aren't in fact true which is likely the case the whole house of cards falls.But did I like it? Not really, it was OK and vaguely interesting from start to finish, but I never really cared who lived or died, and there was no scene that was especially memorable over the whole 2 odd hours.Except That I watched Bram Stoker's Dracula a few months back, and I tell ya From Hell has so many similarities in feel, tone and vision that if you watched them back to back you might think they were part of a series.Seriously, that's all I can remember, is someone asks me next week I'll say: ""It reminds me of Bram Stoker's Dracula.""

74,mattymatt4ever,Stylish and intriguing--one hell of a ride!!!,7,30 May 2002,"When I saw the previews my first thought was ""The Hughes Brothers directed this?""  No offense, they're great at what they do.  ""Menace 2 Society"" and ""Dead Presidents"" are both very good movies, but how are they gonna pan out directing a period piece?  Well, this isn't a period piece in the conventional sense.  Most of the time when you think ""period piece"" you think about something along the lines of ""Sense and Sensibility.""  ""From Hell"" is more like a modern day crime thriller/horror flick taking place in the late 1800's.  The sets and costumes fit the period, but the style is modern.  I knew nothing about the Jack the Ripper murders previous to viewing the movie, so I found this movie entertaining as well as informative.  And the DVD contains a couple of documentaries about the real Ripper murders.  Like many historians said, there were many suspects, but they never really found out who was the real Jack the Ripper.  So the Hughes Brothers had a little bit of artistic liberty in creating the story.  The plot twist is really neat, I never expected *namesake* to be the killer.  But other than the Ripper's true identity, the Hughes stayed strict to how the rest of the murders were committed.  I was surprised to find out that there are in fact a lot of historical inaccuracies present--at least that's what it says in the ""goofs"" section, they could be wrong.  According to the featurette, the Hughes Brothers were sticklers for detail.  But who cares anyway?  So what if they did get a few things wrong?  Is there anybody watching this movie that was actually around during the 19th century?  The sets look magnificent and so do the costumes. That's all I care about.  I'm glad the Hughes cast Johnny Depp in the lead role.  He's absolutely perfect at anything he does, never failing to give a vibrant, Oscar-worthy performance.  So him being the star was one of my main motivations for seeing this movie.  I read that actors like Brad Pitt and Sean Connery were considered for the role.  Well, no one can fit the part better than Johnny Depp.  His English accent is perfect, but I wasn't worried he wouldn't be able to pull it off--he's Johnny Depp, he can pull off anything!  Who I was surprised about was Heather Graham.  Though she's often good at what she does, she usually does fluff films and I was surprised that she was able to fluently pull off the English accent as well as deliver a fully convincing performance.  When I rented the movie, the clerk said to me ""Just to let you know:  There are certain historical flaws in the movie...like there were no prostitutes back then who looked like Heather Graham.  In fact, they didn't even look like women.""  Well, Heather did seem a little misplaced among the rest of the prostitutes, who did in fact look as ugly as the real prostitutes during the period, but I was willing to suspend disbelief. Despite that mild casting error, her performance was convincing.  Robbie Coltrane is amusing as Depp's sidekick, and they have an interesting chemistry.  Also among the great cast of English actors are Ian Holm and Ian Richardson.  The effects are gory, but not gratuitous.  The Hughes Brothers did leave enough to the audience's imagination.  If you have an extremely weak stomach, you'll definitely cringe and maybe hurl, but if not you should be fine.  But I didn't really look at it as a horror film perse.  I thought of it more as a murder mystery, though many will probably think of it more along the lines of horror.  But even if you think of it as horror, it's not slice-and-dice ""Friday the 13th"" horror.  It's horror with a story--a very good one.  I was intrigued throughout, especially since I knew nothing about the Ripper murders.  And there are some nice touches of comic relief.  I love the scene in which The Ripper says, ""One day people will look back and say I gave birth to the 20th century.""  Johnny Depp pulls out a gun and replies, ""You're not going to see the 20th century.""  Those who know a lot about The Ripper murders will probably complain about the littlest of details, and be very cynical in approaching the movie, but I found it to be a wild ride.  It's intriguing, it's stylish and extremely well-acted.  I'm not asking for much more!  My score:  7 (out of 10)",From Hell
75,jhclues,"A Satisfying Consideration of the ""Ripper"" Case",8,18 July 2002,"The case of Jack the Ripper has long been, and continues to be, one of the great unsolved mysteries of all time, and as such has been the subject of numerous treatments in film.  Of them all, however, none has advanced a more logical or plausible theory in explanation of the who, whys and wherefores of the infamous serial killer than `From Hell,' directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes, which attempts to solve the mystery that has by consensus long been deemed `unsolvable.'  But-- cinematically speaking, at any rate-- the Hughes Brothers make a decidedly solid case of it.It's 1888, London; in the Whitechapel district prostitutes are being systematically slaughtered in a precise and grisly manner.  Scotland Yard is at a loss to solve or stop the murders, and Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is assigned to investigate.  Abberline is somewhat unique in his approach, as he is invested with certain prescient abilities, which he enhances through the use of opium, laudanum and absinthe; not the usual methods employed by the police, but it does effect the desired results. 
Abberline discovers a link between the victims, and along the way becomes involved with one of the `girls,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), who may be in danger because of something she knows.  But as Abberline gets closer to a solution, he very well may be in danger also; he knows too much, and there is one, especially, who would find ease if he were to just disappear.  And by any means necessary.The proper atmosphere is, of course, a requirement if one is to tell this story convincingly, and the Hughes Brothers succeed nicely in this regard. But it would be hard to find a movie about the Ripper that did NOT achieve a proper mood; it's kind of a common link that ties all of the previous offerings together, up to and including this one.  This film differs from the rest in one important respect, however, and it's a big one-- that being the story itself.  Whereas the others are good at leading you down the path and taking you nowhere, the Hughes Brothers go out on a limb and actually deliver a satisfying ending, and moreover, one that solves the mystery. It's all speculation, of course, but this film will leave you feeling closer to the truth than ever before.  It's well crafted and executed, and they manage to keep the air fairly heavy with menace and suspense, from the beginning right up to the very end, which ultimately defines it as something of a `fable-noir.'Johnny Depp gives a solid, convincing performance as Abberline, who is something of the antithesis of another of his creations, Constable Ichabod Crane, of Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow.'  It's a challenge for an actor to take on two roles somewhat similar in nature to begin with, and successfully manage to make them quite the opposite of one another in the end, which is what Depp has done with these respective portrayals.  The events surrounding Crane may have been dark, but Ichabod was not; here, however, Deep finds a dark side of his character, Abberline, that is as enigmatic as the case with which he is dealing, and it is that to which Depp plays, approaching from the depths and looking up, rather than observing from a position of light, as he did in `Hollow.'  And it demonstrates that Depp is endowed with that same kind of chameleon-like quality that serves such actors as De Niro and Billy Bob Thornton so well; it's a matter of being able to transform oneself from the inside out, which comparably few actors can do with any real success.Heather Graham does a good job with her role of Mary; she's convincing for the most part, but there are moments when it's something of a challenge for the viewer to totally believe that she is a `lady of the night.'  Her appearance seems almost a bit too polished, especially compared to the other girls.  It's a minor complaint, however, as overall, though her performance may not necessarily be one of the strengths of the film, it certainly does nothing to detract from the effectiveness of it.The performance turned in by Ian Holm, on the other hand, is definitely one of the film's strengths.  As Sir William Gull, he is quite believable, with a probing portrayal that does much for the credibility of the story. 
Also helping things along substantially, are Robbie Coltrane (who has since become known, and will forever after be, `Harry Potter's' Hagrid), as Abberline's colleague, Peter Godley, and Susan Lynch (who previously gave such a remarkable performance as Nora Barnacle in `Nora,' opposite Ewan McGregor), as Liz Stride.The supporting cast includes Ian Richardson (Sir Charles Warren), Jason Flemyng (Netley), Katrin Cartlidge (Dark Annie), Terence Harvey (Ben Kidney), Paul Rhys (Dr. Ferral) and Lesley Sharp (Kate).  Arguably the best and, without question the most satisfying of all the `Ripper' movies, `From Hell' is a well made, graphic and thought provoking consideration of the Whitechapel killings, which for quite some time held all of London in the grip of fear and terror.  The conclusions offered here may just be as close to the truth as anyone will ever get; in the event that it is pure fiction, however,it is decidedly good fiction that makes for a couple of hours of riveting entertainment and speculation.  Be forewarned, this one is not going to be for everyone, as many of the mental, as well as visual images it presents are extremely disconcerting.  Definitely not for the squeamish, but for those who are so disposed, this one will prove to be quite an experience.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",From Hell
76,Stampsfightclub,Darkly set but lacking the passion and tension of the story,7,19 August 2009,"In 1888 London psychic detective Fred Abberline (Depp) seeks to solve the mystery of Jack the Ripper.There have numerous critics slating this movie for its inaccurate depiction of the legend murderer and the poor adapting of English accents from the two leads.But From Hell is, when you watch it for the first time, undeniably intriguing with a passion and an interior motive to tell the tale of one of the mythical tales of Victorian era.Johnny Depp stars as Frederick Abberline, a worn down detective with a tendency to see the future. Depp's English accent is one to be scrutinized and whilst the critics may have a point on this matter, it doesn't shy away from the fact Depp is arguably miscast in the central role. The bravado of Captain Jack is missing, the surprise and imagination of Edward has disappeared and in the place is a stone coloured mask that denotes misery and lack of enthusiasm that is hard to see the balance of the character when considering the dialogue. For example the eventuality of Mary leaves Depp looking confused rather than surprised and amazed not to forget his expressionless and passionate responds to the constant murders of the womenfolk.Depp's far from on form here but do not be discouraged as come the end of the film we see his character thrive out of the darkness to see some much needed passion that wraps up the political incorrectness of the time and reflect on what has been a startling story.The plot revolves around The Ripper with each murder seemingly brutal with its use of powerful blood and gore to give Sweeney Todd a run for its money. Each murder adds spice and tension to the plot with some conscientious mystery that will baffle and intrigue right up until the revealing identity. Seeing the identity of The Ripper kind of spoilt the flowing mystery of the film and you may be wondering who and why had the film finished with a sharper climax considering the last murder.From Hell is a sharp period drama with a good sense of costume and setting to justify the times and issues that contained within them. The dark lighting and the sharp colours of the sky are worthy mentions to give that extra edge and a feeling of misery to the dark narrative, particularly considering the involvements. From murder to sex, this isn't afraid of shying away from realistic activities of past life, and with the political incorrectness regarding the force and the Monarch it may be seen as controversial.Where From Hell fails is with Depp unfortunately. Had there been a bit more spice and vigour in his dialogue then the plot may have been more engaging, a tad more passionate to really entice the viewer into the dramatic proceedings. The direction by the Hughes brothers leaves a lot to be answered for as some of the sex scenes are awkward rather than fiery and when the Ripper sits down on the bed, you wonder why. Worth a look",From Hell
77,CharltonBoy,Does not do old Jack Justice.,7,8 December 2002,"Considering the worldly known legend of Jack The Ripper it is suprising there has not been a top class movie made about him. From Hell is possibly the best so far but it falls a long way short of being a top movie.This looks good and the acting is ok even the accents werent as bad as i was expecting but the story is a major let down. ******* Spoiler Alert ******** This version of the ripper story lays the murders down to a group of free Mason's which while i have a personal dislike to Free Masonary and their pathetic antics , it's hardly a great conclusion to one of London's most famous mysteries. You can also see that this is a Hollywood production because as per usual they portray 19th century London as Foggy , Cold , full of Prostitutes and drunks and it is constantly night. Our American cousins must think we live like bats! 7 out of 10.",From Hell
78,MihaiSorinToma,A boring series of murders,6,28 August 2017,"In a past London, inspector Frederick is assigned to investigate a series of very gruesome but also complex murders, which seemed to target a group of prostitutes. He has to analyze each murder in detail as the killer is a person with high expertise regarding dissections and human anatomy, making him even harder to get. Using his ""visions"", he must get to the bottom of the case fast, facing gangsters and corruption, before the woman he recently fell for is going to be the next victim.Although it had every ingredient to be a great movie, from actors to an interesting idea, it showed how not to make such a movie. It is boring as hell, while Depp's characters leaves us waiting a long time in the beginning for him to appear, and when he does, he does little to raise the tempo to a more enjoyable one, only providing some intelligent dialogue and replies now and then. Besides being boring, it has a group of characters who are as dull as they are annoying, some of them seeming to beg to be killed, deliberately ignoring strict and precise orders. Its finale is another big disappointment in my opinion, finishing the story without any style or even sense. As an upside, it managed to keep a dark and spooky atmosphere, in which the identity of the mysterious killer could remain unknown till late. Honestly, I wasn't expecting such a result from a movie which had a very good lead actor and an interesting sounding story line, fact which makes it even more disappointing.",From Hell
79,Jack the Ripper1888,Great! The best horror movie of the year 2001!,10,13 April 2002,"I saw this movie with my father and my brother on its second day in theaters. We went there not knowing what the movie was about. All I had heard was that Johnny Depp was in it. The same guy who did such a remarkable job on SLEEPY HOLLOW, which FROM HELL seems to be like in many ways. The first five minutes were a little boring, and since I missed Marilyn Manson's opening song, I had little to hope for. But by the end of the first murder, I thought ""Wow! Cool! She's already dead!"" After that, the movie just went up hill. It got better and better as it went along. The worst part for me was that in the blackness of the theater, me and my 29 year old brother ended up sitting in a double seat together. And my father (who was lucky and got a single seat) fell asleep twice and was continuously complaining ""This movie's too damn gory and violent!"" And I bit my tounge to keep myself from exclaiming ""Well no sh*t! Its a movie about Jack the Ripper! What do you expect? A nice family movie?"" Well, that it is not. It is extremely violent. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* The goriest part is when Jack slashes wide open the throat of one of the victims. When we left the theater, we had to listen to my dad's constant complaining while all I was thinking about was how long it would take for the film to come out on video. I would find out seven months later. Its only April and I still have to wait another month for this movie to come out on May 14. But, I guess its worth it since that's my birthday. But having to wait eight months for one damn movie to come out really sucks! DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE came out in December and it comes out in three days! Now look who's complaining. So, I give this movie 5/5. It was definetly the best horror film of the year 2001.",From Hell
80,RonellSowes,Aptly titled,3,1 January 2021,"There's a couple of sources from which movies can be adapted from,with varying results,but one entertainment medium that never fails to equal in poor films are graphic novels. From Hell is an adaptation of one that is based off of The Ripper killings. There's certainly been a number of films based on Jack The Ripper almost all of which are of inferior quality.
A very good actor can raise a mediocre film but likewise an atrocious film,like From Hell,can drag down an actor as skilled as Johnny Depp. Perhaps this picture would only have been half as bad if it was directed by one person instead of two. Or maybe it would have been twice as worse. Either way the director(s) of the film are a dangerous combination of being sapient and talentless;trying to create an atmosphere of terror and mystique but leaving a disaster of a finished product. Couple that with a travesty of a script and your off to a pretty bad start.",From Hell

It is actually a pretty good thriller. Johnny Depp does a great job as always and the supporting cast was solid. And the storyline was intriguing filled with twists and turns.This movie is about a young detective who is sent to London to investiage the a string of murders of young woman, mainly prostitutes who are being brutally murdered and cut apart by the man known to everyone as Jack the ripper.This movie was pretty good the only reason I give it a six and not higher is mainly because of the ending.

82,tomimt,A disappointment,5,3 March 2006,"To the defense of the makers of the movie 'From Hell' it must be said, that no one could have followed the material written by Alan Moore to the graphical novel drawn by Eddie Campbell: there just is too much plot for a single movie. If by the other hand they would have decided to make a TV-series out of the novel, the result would have been entirely different.The most constructive difference between the graphical novel and the movie is, that the novel is about Jack The Ripper: who he is and why he does what he does. The movie is a film about Abberline and his personality and his mission to stop the monster. And some fool decided to add these mystical foresight abilities to Abberline, who in fact was described as rather normal fellow in the novel.Jhonny Depp plays the part of Abberline, and that was a bit disappointment for all, who actually have read the novel, as Abberline is no where near Depp's appearance: he's shorter and more rounder. Best role of the film is given to Ian Holm, who play Dr. Sir William Gull, the official doctor of the royal family. The rest of the cast is good, tough I question of the cast of the prostitutes, or does Heather Graham really strike anyone as 19'th century harlot?From some reason or another all movies based on Alan Moore's brilliant writing fail to capture the essence and the spirit of his works. The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was same kind of disappointment from the same reason. Moore's characterisations are far too bold for typical Hollywood films. They will always fail to portray them right.",From Hell
83,Movie-12,"A few nice sequences, exquisite performances, a convincing technical department, and a superb third act. But the execution of the ideas doesn't work. **1/2 (out of four",6,6 November 2001,"FROM HELL / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)It is the dramatically gruesome ideas that make this film what it is, but it is the poor execution of those ideas that makes this film what it is not. ""From Hell"" contains a few nice sequences, exquisite performances by Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm, a very convincing technical department, and it has a superb third act. Unfortunately, despite those positive factors, the film as a whole doesn't quite work. Jack the Ripper committed five gruesome, ritualistic murders during a ten-week span in London during the fall of 1888. He was never caught. As the first tabloid star of the twentieth century, he is remembered as one of the most notorious serial killers in history. ""From Hell"" does not successfully bring him to life, though the Hughes brothers certainly breathe life into the era. The film's sets were created by Academy Award-winning production designer Martin Child. He and seventy artists and carpenters constructed a 20-acre set near Barrandov Studios. Their hard work pays off; the film embodies an entirely believable design. It's a great achievement from a technical standpoint. Based on a popular graphic novel, ""From Hell"" referrers to the return address on a letter from Jack the Ripper. The always entertaining Johnny Depp stars as it's recipient, Fred Abberline, a tormented Inspector who seeks temporary relief with opium. His unendurable addiction gives him visions of the future. Let's have some more about Abberline's internal struggles and opium addiction. Let's dive into his mind and explore the source of these visions and addictions. This is a very intriguing aspect of the character, but the film never really develops this subject. Instead we get a shallow, flat concept that never leaves ground. Inspector Abberline is called to duty when a vicious serial killer takes the lives of several prostitutes. As the bodies start piling, the inspector realizes his superiors are far more interested in preventing public panic than finding the killer. One figure, however, named Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), takes interest in Abberline. As a physician to the royal family, Gull is a powerful enough figure to assist Abberline in his investigation. They discover a secret that threatens everyone who knows it.
Albert and Allen Hughes direct the film with a sense of precise detail. They took extreme measures to assure the film's effectiveness. They softened the lighting by placing a silk cloth over the rear of the lenses. They shot the flashback sequences on positive film. Fast motion and time-lapse photography give the movie a unique flavor. The cinematography creates an ominous presence. The Hughes' failure lies not within the technical aspects of the film, however, but within the misconnection with the audience. Despite a plot about the mystery and horror of Jack the Ripper, the movie is not particularly scary, nor does it work as a mystery. Watching the movie, I never found myself guessing the identity of the killer, nor did I follow the characters, or identify with which victim would be the next to go. There is no real sense of a puzzle here; the script does not give us enough to care about the killer or his victims. Much has been said about the film's violent content. Although it certainly suggests strong, gruesome violence, we seldom actually witness it. ""From Hell"" does contain some of the most grotesque images I have seen in film, but as a whole, Jack the Ripper's violent acts are not witnessed, but implied. During the murders, we usually only see a quick flash of a knife, and then partial glimpse of the aftermath of the victims. It's a letdown, since it's one of the few interesting things in the movie. 
All of this notwithstanding, even if there was more stomach-churning gore it would not have saved the movie. Violence relives tension, and ""From Hell"" does not build a single iota of suspense. No wonder why there is no sense of mystery or intrigue; for most of the film, we are sitting flat on our butts. In a movie like this, we want to be on the edge of our seats. To make matters worse, this film is almost two hours long. You know the sensation you get in your butt when you drive a car for a really long time? That cramped, anxious feeling that makes you want to get out of the car and stretch? That's how I felt during this movie.",From Hell

85,moviesleuth2,One of the darkest films that I have ever seen,7,5 July 2010,"""From Hell"" takes place in our worst nightmares, a place so dark and scary that even walking around is enough to drive someone mad. This is a very, VERY dark film. It's so dark that it makes ""Seven"" look like ""The Wizard of Oz."" Then again, you wouldn't expect a movie based on Jack the Ripper to be light and cheery, now would you?London, 1888. A young prostitute was murdered in the Whitechapel district. The police enlist the help of Fredrick Abberline (Johnny Depp) because of the savagery of the murder and because his opium hallucinations help him solve crimes. But more victims fall, Abberline begins to realize that these murders are connected.The film has a brilliantly dark atmosphere. You know that odd creepy feeling you get when you read about haunted mental asylums, and images of demented doctors performing horrific experiments come to mind? That's what ""From Hell"" feels like. It's an unsettling feeling, and the Hughes Brothers are skillful in their employment of this unnerving feeling.The acting is solid, although the film's best hand is the atmosphere. Johnny Depp, who according to his IMDb bio is fascinated by Jack the Ripper, plays things straight (as far as Depp can go in that direction). Heather Graham is also solid as Mary Kelly, the prostitute that Abberline develops feelings for. She speaks with a credible Cockney accent, and tones down the perkiness that she's known for to a very low level. Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane provide good support as well.The problem with the film is the story. Whether it was in the scripting stage or in production, the story is confusing at times, particularly at the end. This is one of those movies where you have to pay attention, or else you will get lost (which is quite possible, considering how strong the atmosphere is).Let me make myself clear: this is a very dark and disturbing film. Most of the violence and gore are left to the imagination (which will be on overkill due to grisly descriptions of the murders), but there is no doubt that this movie deserves as hard of an R rating as can be found. Definitely not for the faint of heart or the blood-phobic.",From Hell

Not since David Lynch's ""Elephant Man"" has there been such a hauntingly unique and creative artistic vision of Victorian England.

Add in a delightfully witty performance from rotund British character actor Robbie Coltrane, some fantastic theories on Jack the Ripper, marvelously imaginative and literate direction from a pair of ghetto-raised black brothers, a wonderful script spun from a graphic comic-book (!), a suitably off-kilter turn by Johnny Depp, conspiracy theories, political intrigue, scantily clad women, cool costumes, a wonderfully bad Irish accent from Heather Graham, some wild dream sequences and low and behold, you have one of the greatest Gothic-horror-gory-murder mysteries ever produced.

87,Antagonisten,Neither good nor bad,5,8 January 2007,"The movies i find most difficult to write a review about are the ones that are neither good nor bad but rather somewhere in between. This is definitely one of those movies.I saw ""From Hell"" in the theater back when it was released. And i left the screening not really knowing what to think. While there are a lot of things to like about the movie, it still didn't give me a lasting impression and the story quickly faded from my memory. What i definitely liked was Johnny Depp's doped out investigator, i also liked the very beautiful sceneries and the fact that several of the surrounding actors were very good. No, the problem was neither in the production nor in the acting department. Nor was it due to a boring subject-matter, there is definitely something that's still enticing and curious about Jack the Ripper.So what was it? Well, i don't know really but my best guess is the script. Because despite all this scenery, these good actors and this interesting real-life story, the end-result is actually rather dull and uninteresting. The movie didn't leave a mark, didn't make me want to learn more about Jack the Ripper, and worst of all it didn't really entertain me much. There was simply no nerve, no excitement, present. And for a thriller that's not good.So i guess the grade is... difficult to give. While it was decently entertaining during it's running time, and there was much nice scenery and images to watch, it faded immediately after the movie ended. And of the exciting chase for Jack the Ripper not much excitement remained (or was ever present). So i guess this is somewhere between good and bad, which means... a 5/10?",From Hell

It's fun and enjoyable movie from start to finish. Author of the graphic novel wasn't really amazed by Johnny Depp performance, but I find it charming, because it's a portrayal of a relatively normal man. Later Depp really lost it and shown us he cannot really act normal, and that turned him from my most beloved actor to... Well, what he is now. Anyway, the movie is very well executed, characters are fun and the plot is interesting and makes you care. Costumes and scenes are great, as well as the atmosphere. However, don't expect a horror, because you won't find it. It's more of a crime thriller. Movie also manages to make you hate Jack the Ripper, so that's a plus.

93,chrisbrown6453,The Hughes brothers take a mediocre stab at reviving one of the most horrifying murder investigations of all time.,6,20 June 2002,"Known for creating effective dramatizations of violence in urban culture, the talent of these two brothers is lost in 19th century London. Even though From Hell misses the mark, you have to give them credit for trying. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, this movie is a speculated story about the cryptic tale in 1888 East London surrounding the aristocracy, a madman named Jack the Ripper, and five unknowing whores who all share a deadly secret.
Within the Whitechappel district of London (an exceptional facsimile built just outside of Prague), a murderer is on the loose. Set out to capture this mysterious villain is Inspector Frederick Abbeline (Johnny Depp). We first meet Abbeline as he wakes from an opium trip, a frequent substance used by this character to thwart his clairvoyant visions. Abbeline can see the murders before they happen. Thus, he is the one man to find the killer. The story focuses on Abbeline and a group of whores who are the primary targets of the grotesque human-carving rampage. Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the whores, slowly befriends Abbeline as she becomes terribly frightened for her life. Abbeline discovers that these murders are so precisely executed that only a man with great knowledge of the human anatomy can be responsible. This is when he meets Sir William Gull (Ian Holm), a physician of the royal family, who assists Abbeline in piecing together the puzzle. Screenwriters Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias do a terrific job of hiding the man in the shadow's identity until the last minutes of the film.
If your stomach could withstand the gore in Hannibal, you'll have no problem with this movie. It makes you wonder where the boundaries are nowadays for cinema as far as what is appropriate to show on screen and what crosses the line. It is much more effective if you leave certain things to the imagination instead of forcing your viewers to cover their eyes at every corner. Bloody effects are a bad excuse to further the plot; it's unessential; not even needed. The love relationship between Graham's Mary and Depp's Abbeline is an undeveloped side story that gets lost in the cobblestones of London. Yet again, it does nothing to further the plot and strips the story of its momentum, catering to Hollywood's unnecessary must-find-romance-somewhere agenda. Heather Graham as a wench is so unconvincing that it is sad to see the poor girl attempt to spit out an accent. Compared to the other whores in Mary's group of friends with missing teeth and bad complexion, dirt seems to easily avoid Mary and dental hygiene must be on the top of her priority list. A box of red hair dye and a Victorian corset cannot save Graham from being poorly cast in a role too far over her head. Depp, with his piercing eyes and oozing sensuality does a fine job with his character but even he can't save this movie from hell.",From Hell
94,pfgpowell-1,Entertaining enough...,6,8 May 2009,"The 'Jack the Ripper' murders endure for no other reason than that the man himself was never identified. There have been equally as brutal murders the world over, but these are different because not having anyone to finger, we can finger anyone. And that is exactly what writers, playwrights and movie-makers have done ever since. Actually, 'Jack the Ripper' was as much an invention of the then nascent tabloid Press as anything else. The name is supposedly derived from a letter the murderer is said to have sent to the Press, but the received wisdom is that it was, in fact, dreamed up by some sub-editor with one eye on a good headline to a cracking story. (One of the first and most useful pieces of advice I and more or less every young reporter is given when starting out on our careers of discovering and unearthing the truth wherever it might lurk is: 'Don't let a couple of facts stand in the way of a good story.' I am pleased to report that I haven't, ever.) There is even very credible doubt that there even was a Jack the Ripper. Around the time his alleged victims were butchered, another six or seven other working girls in the neighbourhood were also murdered. The Ripper murders were attributed to the one killer merely because of the particularly gruesome manner five of the victims were mutilated and disembowelled. So these deaths have always been a fertile ground for artists of most kind (and one artist, the celebrated Walter Sickert, has also been named as the 'definitive Jack the Ripper). Here 'the Hughes Brothers' of whom I had never heard until tonight — are they, too, perhaps the invention of some overwrought sub-editor's imagination? — rework the story and interweave the gruesome end of the five prostitutes with a conspiracy which, as we subs are apt to proclaim in our sub-heads, 'goes right to the very top'. As stories and conspiracies go, it isn't half bad. Unfortunately, a previous Ripper film got in there first more than 20 years earlier, but From Hell is none the worse for that. The cast plays it rather well, especially Johnny Depp, whose lower-class London accent has been criticised by some, but it didn't offend me, and if that is the worst criticism that could be aimed at From Hell, the fabled 'Hughes Brothers' have little to worry about. Depp, as usual (well, in these viewers eyes, at least) again seems to ham it up, but very subtly, that is, not so you'd notice. In fact, the man can play this kind of part with his eyes closed, and I, for one, would like to see him in a far more challenging role where real acting is demanded rather than simply not forgetting his lines and not bumping into the furniture. I like to think we wouldn't be disappointed. I wasn't particularly convinced by Heather Graham who must be one of the cleanest whores working the streets in Whitechapel. Apart from these two Yanks, each more or less successfully adopting English accents — which rather begs the question: why cast Yanks? — the rest of the cast are all old familiar faces, lead from the front by the ever dependable Ian Holm and Ian Richardson, who can also both turn in the required performance with their eyes shut and still be home in good time for supper. Prague doubled up as East London, and a rather clean and sanitised East London it was, too. But I mustn't grumble: From Hell provides an entertaining two hours of rather good hokum, doesn't descend to the rather cheap depths of a slasher movie and will get you and your friends discussing the identity of the Ripper and the conspiracy behind it for, oh, at least six minutes before you find something better to do. Oh, and the usual caveat: elsewhere in these member's reviews you will find the standard hyperbole of From Hell being the best film ever made ever. Why do they bother?",From Hell
95,alicecbr,Queen Victoria was NOT a nice lady!!!,9,31 August 2002,"So don't expect truth from this movie.  I didn't, so was quite 'entertained' -- if watching a heart spurt it's blood geyserlike into a fireplace is entertaining. Not knowing any of the history, I could accept it for what it was, a movie with some excellent acting from Johnny Depp and those wonderful English actors.  Thank God there is still the class-consciousness and upraised finger to the 'posh' that I love about my hypocritical country, shown by the incompetent head inspector over-ruling the smart young if addicted detective.  (Follow the money, to find out about social class in the United States.  But at least we PRETEND to be class-less, and come to think of it, we often are!!!).Interesting perspective on the FreeMasons, about whom I'm now inspired to find out.  Did they really have human sacrifices, and were they in collusion to do horrible things, an upper-class lynch mob?  My step-father was all set to go through initiation into the Masons and discovered at the last moment their segregation rules, so sacrificed the paid dues and the bonhomie of their companionship (during the 60s).If you think of the movie as a better-than-average thriller, you'll like it, with some good acting to boot.  The carriage of DEATH with the heavy-footed black horses set the mood, nicely.  In fact, have a ""Jack the Ripper"" home film festival and watch Michael Caine's version after this one.  Many similar touches.  Someday someone will give us a dramatic movie that shows us the forces that drive a woman into prostitution and it's horrible degradation.

97,supertom-3,"Tense and Eerie, as ever Depp is excellent!",8,10 February 2002,"I am not a big fan of the horrer genre at all basically becuase most are bad and the fact is I don't get scared by what happens in movies. I don't mind mystery chillers or the more pyschological horrer like this film, the sort of film that substitutes attractive, screaming, 18 year old girls with clearly visible nipples(Rose Mcgowen, Scream) for a developing plot and atmospheric build up. I particularly find little enjoyment from the slasher genre especially teen slashers. Supposed classics like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on elm street I think are so overated. The first Scream I found good though but still over-rated. Anyway this film is a horrer mystery that builds up atmospheric tension and neat plot twists and developments. The lighting and sets in this movie are fantastic. The cast are made up of a host of British thespiens and of course the two hollywood film stars Johnny Depp and the gorgeous Heather Graham. Of course Depp and Graham are there purely to sell the film ahead of their acting talents which are considerable. Johnny Depp in the last three years has stared in three excellent horrer flicks of various styles, this, Sleepy Hollow and the Ninth Gate. All with him featuring a different style character with a different accent. Depp has proven himself as a brilliant character actor. In ""From Hell"" he stars as a detective who has visions and is a drug addict. He is on the case of Jack the Ripper with the help of the equally good Robbie Coltrane. The Ripper is killing prostitutes and has targeted five working girls in particular for his ritualistic murders. They include Grahams characters as well as Lesley Sharp and Annabelle Apison as two of the other Whores, the remaining two I know by face from other films but cannot think of their names. The film is very effective, it has its tense moments and towards the end of the film we get more gore as the ripper starts to rampage. Both the American leads do very good cockney accents as do the British luvvies. As for the plot well it nears the point of losing the audience with plot twists and conspiracy theories but the big twists of the film are generally surprising. I was sitting in my seat and half an hour in I thought I'd worked it out, I was well proud of myself and had a grin like a cheshire cat until the Rippers identity was made clear and frankly I was way off. Some moments are quite obvious but that is the case of any movie in history. Overall this was a very good chiller, the story was good and the plot twists were also surpising. I loved the recreation of 19th century London and the lighting effects the film really takes you to another time and place (unless your from london then its just another time). Although the film is good it is one of those that is rather forgettable, I won't remember much in a few weeks except for the plot twist. 8/10",From Hell
98,Bogey Man,The Hughes Brothers' version of the Ripper myth,7,19 May 2002,"Albert and Allen Hughes are the men behind the punching debut Menace II Society and the masterpiece Dead Presidents, so I had naturally pretty high expectations on From Hell, a film about the notorious Jack The Ripper. The film is definitely not their masterpiece but it is nice to see that this kind of cinema still exists in Hollywood. It tells the story of violent murders in London of 1888, as unidentified murderer kills prostitutes without any significant reason. A young and sad-faced detective played by Johnny Depp starts to solve the case, and the deeper he gets, the more twists take place..The film looks great with all its fog, smoke and ominous lightning. The film is very dark all the time which is nice and very atmospheric. The presence of pure evil is there all the time. There are at least three unforgettable images and scenes in this film and I leave them for you to spot. All I will say is that the scenes involve red sky, a bridge and eyes over the city... The photography is very great and technically this film is magnificent. Hughes brothers are very talented and I'm glad that they directed this, as now there is enough personal touch in the film, and the film is not just another stupid entertainment flick.The murders are occasionally graphic and disturbing but for most of the time they are shown as flashbacks and with fast editing. The film is still pretty gory so some will find it too offensive, but more offensive is the motivations and the pure wickedness of the Jack. He is definitely like the Devil himself and at one point he even mentions that he lives in Hell. So this is one Hell of a movie! The fast editings and flashbacks is in fact pretty effective and stylistic element, so I think that even more demanding film lovers may like From Hell, too.The love affair between the two protagonists is a little unnecessary but doesn't go too far, fortunately. In the middle part, the film concentrates too much on the affair between these characters and it seems like they forgot the whole Jack! But as a whole, the film manages to deliver the story and not to get tiresome. I am not familiar with the graphic novels this film is based on, so fans of the original material may find (and find) many differences and faults in this film. But after all, From Hell is an okay horror/gothic experience from great directors, and as I mentioned earlier, it is great that these talents still exist among the entertainment oriented big studios.Not a masterpiece but still satisfying and atmospheric film. 7/10",From Hell
99,p-jonsson,Quite nice Victorian drama although the ending is quite tragic,7,14 October 2014,"I cannot say that I am an outright fan of old era British crime stories but I do fancy them now and then. This one is a rather dark, grim and gloomy story perfectly suitable as a evening movie at this time of the year when darkness already starts to come quickly and matches the candlelight mood of Victorian London.I found this a quite nice movie. Well up to its very end which I have to admit is way too tragic for my taste. The voyage to the end was well worth watching though. The dark scenery is very well done. Beautiful and depressing at the same time. It is yet another Jack the Ripper based story and it is pretty much pure fiction loosely based on the character of Jack the Ripper. It is a good and well implemented story though and it was enjoyable to follow Inspector Abelard unravel to true reason behind the murders.As far as I am concerned the acting was without any major faults and generally of high standard although it is perhaps a bit sad that Johnny Depp again proves that he plays best in roles that portrays a more or less crazy, even insane, character.The movie is not as gory as one perhaps and it certainly would not classify as a horror movie. Most of the violence is hidden from the viewer although there are a couple of scenes which are a wee bit ""splattery"" but only if you really have a weak stomach for these things and if you do perhaps you should not watch serial killer movies in the first place.The ending took a star or two off this movies rating but otherwise it was surprisingly enjoyable.",From Hell
100,anton-6,Very well-done but...,7,14 July 2002,"... First of all I think it is a film that in maybe 20 or 30 years it will not be forgotten. It has a very scary style and I am very impressed that the Hughes Brother made this film. They have before made films like Dead Presidents(Which I haven't seen) and Menace to Society(Which is actually good). The acting was originally why I saw this film, I like Johnny Depp very much and he is very good in this one. I mostly see him in this pretty strange roles and he does them very well. Heather Graham was not bad either but nothing special at all.
It is a very entertaining film even if I thought the story was a bit complicated and everything was not perfect. Before I saw ""From Hell"" I belivied that it should be a bit better then it was, still I will see it again and now I recommend it because overall it is a good film.

101,ozthegreatat42330,"This one is the real thing, more or less.",8,26 March 2007,"As with many films based on true historical events, there have been a few liberties with the film plot. But the character of Frederick Aberline was very much real, and was the lead investigator of the Jack the Ripper murders. I just finished watching ""Murder By Decree"" a 1979 film on the ripper murder subject with Sherlock Holmes as the protagonist, and many of the critics of that film ran down this movie as be too far fetched, or Aberline as a second rate invention. But in fact Abeline (Johnny Depp) was very real, just as was Robert Lees the noted medium of the 1890's who worked with the police on several cases. I enjoyed ""Murder by Decree"" for it's style and cast but this film for it's more accurate portrayal of the events of the White Chapel murders. Depp and Coltrrane are excellent and well portrayed with their warts as well as their good qualities. This film stands well on it's own.",From Hell

Graham's performance isn't bad either and I absolutely adored her hair.

103,deanofrpps,Hell Knows its Own,9,4 August 2007,"Dateline: 1888, the London, slum of Whitechapel. Harassed by thugs and pimps, streetwalkers Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her companions meet daily misery until their friend Ann (Poppy Rogers) whose marriage to a budding artist (Mark Dexter) has rescued her and her daughter from the mean streets is mysteriously kidnapped in broad daylight and prostitutes disappear in a series of gruesome murders. To ferret out the fiend who delights in gore, Police officials summon Inspector Fred Abberline, (Johnny Depp) a brilliant though erratic detective lost in the haze of cocaine addiction hiding from his terrifying psychic ability on one hand and the recent loss of his wife on the other. The film's focus on the infamous Jack the Ripper caper of Victorian times cuts an exciting murder mystery with just the right number of hints to keep the breathless pace compelling at every turn through the twisted back alleys of Whitechapel. Depp gives an other worldly performance entirely appropriate to the subject matter. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson recreate change of century London in a dark though not totally depressing tone. As Abberline becomes immersed in the case, he is aided by a retired physician (Ian Holm) whose hands are no longer steady enough to hold the knife. At the same time, the recently widowed Abberline is falling in love with Mary. To lift the London fog, Abberline frames an interesting hypothesis. His nemesis Jack the Ripper might have been crazy, but still acted logically in his own perverted way to be sure but for purpose larger than killing social undesirables, a handful of expendable prostitutes. But as Abberline breaks through the slippery cordon of roadblocks put in his way, Whitechappel becomes more perilous for Abberline, Mary, and the other girls. Will Satan dance in delight or will Abberline turn back the minions of evil to Hell from whence they came? The Gates of Hell The ripper has overshadowed his competitors for gruesome honor because of his methodical MO: delightfully dissecting his victims with the care worthy of a devoted physician. That the Ripper operated with impunity in the heart of the world's most crowded city of the era and that high police officials ordered destruction of evidence suggests the protection of an highly placed person, the Crown Prince perhaps? Did a wealthy fraternity with influence in the higher levels of power in the police and the ministries of the baroque world empire shield the culprit? Very well shot with stylish backdrops lending a Gothic, creepy touch, From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel by Alan Moore. Directors excelled in attention to period detail and costuming. They may not have been the first to see a royal cabal. But the murders ended when the Crown Prince disappeared from public view into a sanitarium. WHO WERE THE FREEMASONS? Could Lucifer in concert with bedlam have devised a more fiendish plot? The Freemasons have been the villains of many versions of the Ripper Saga. From Hell is extraordinarily candid in portraying supposed Masonic rituals. Yet their role in From Hell is ambivalent. Was a rogue Knight Templar implicated in the Ripper caper? Did the brotherhood punish him for the atrocity itself or for failure in attaining the ultimate goal? The Masons will never say. The Freemasons in the 18th and 19th centuries saw the flowering of their fraternity not only in reactionary Britain but in Republican France, Italy and the United States and even in the Austro-Hungarian Holy Roman Empire. Masons included princes and presidents, police and military officials as well as common tradesmen. Masons were noteworthy figures not only in politics, both democratic and reactionary as well as the arts, sciences and literature. They promoted public education, endowed hospitals and performed acts of charity and benevolence in a time when public and private charity was regarded as fostering excessive growth of a dependent class. As a matter of policy, Masons neither take nor seek credit for their good works nor rebut their critics.",From Hell
104,bix171,Very Effective,9,20 March 2002,"At first, the Hughes Brothers might seem like an odd choice to direct this exceedingly graphic re-imagining of the Jack the Ripper case: two African Americans whose previous films (`Menace II Society' among them) dealt exclusively with current American social issues. But as the film goes on, you begin to be aware of a sympathy the filmmakers have for the Ripper's downtrodden victims that relates full well to their current concerns. Here, the victims are the desperate prostitutes struggling to survive in a ghetto where they are regularly persecuted and violently shaken down; and the Jews, whom the London police use as scapegoats for the murders in order to divert suspicion from a possible royal plot. The effect is subtle and very effective. There's also a great attention to period detail (everything about nineteenth-century London is presented convincingly--the production design is by Martin Childs who also did `Quills') and the added benefits of another excellent performance from Johnny Depp (perhaps today's most daring actor) and a fine one from Heather Graham. They're aided by a fine supporting cast including Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and Katrin Cartlidge (from Mike Leigh's ensemble). All in all, this is a distinguished film with its topics compelling and controversial. Be forewarned, though--this is a stomach-churning experience with many disturbing images and definitely not for the squeamish.",From Hell
105,CelluloidRehab,One day man will look back and say that I gave birth to the Absinthe Revival ....,7,7 March 2006,"London, 1888. Jack the Ripper.In the streets of White Chapel, there's the working classes, filth, grime, dirt, drunks, and prostitutes. The movie focuses in on a group of prostitutes. Heather Graham is Mary Kelly, a member of the group and the Ripper's last victim. Another one of them, Anne, has happily gotten out of the life by marrying a wealthy artist and having a child together. Her perfect life is shattered when strange men burst in (during the middle of a very steamy sex scene) and separate her from her husband and child. They disappear. Anne is diagnosed with dementia and is treated (a.k.a - 3 holes are hammered into her skull).From then all, the remaining girls are killed off one by one (by the Ripper of course). Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) investigates the murders as they occur. His opening scene is one in which he is having one of his ""visions"" while ""chasing the dragon"" (smoking opium) in an opium den. He ""sees"" the murders before or as they're occurring. Of course we all know of the Ripper, however, the movie is from the perspective that everything that happened, is happening as we watch. We are a part of Victorian London.Jack the Ripper is one of those mysteries. Numerous documentaries and movies have been made on the subject and various theories and conspiracies have been created, because of the lack of a information and a resolution. This movie resides happily within those folds. Just like the real investigation, the movie naturally has holes in it. It fills those hole with atmosphere and style. The murders are very graphics and gets progressively more graphic as the movie wears on. The mood is dark. London is in a perpetual coal fog and everything is black, brown, gray or covered with soot. Color is a sparse commodity, but when it shows is strangely captivating (mainly in the volume of fake blood used). I will not get into the various elements that make for an intriguing mystery as this might ruin the plot and the fun. There is romantic connection between Mary Kelly and Abberline, but it is subtle and is cut short by the plot. There is definitely a class struggle, but that is evident from Dickens and the period. This movie has always stood out in my mind because of its style and atmosphere. I didn't find it scary but at the same time I never feel quite comfortable. It is like your leg starting to fall asleep, yet you are unable to do anything about it. Abberline's ritualistic smoking of opium and his bathtub Absinthe preparation are classic. I can safely say Johnny Depp taught me about and how to drink Absinthe. All in all, this is an intriguing movie worthy of at least a rental.",From Hell
106,rollernerd,Visually gory...here comes Jackkkk,6,24 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the mystery thriller, From Hell (2001) which is based on Alan Moore's comic book adaptation where the ever versatile Johnny Depp plays Inspector Abberline investigating the notorious Jack The Ripper murders in Whitechapel, London 1888. Depp's nails the cockney accent and his performance as an opium addict who 'chases the dragons' was the highlight of the movie in particular when he uses his smoked filled visionary dreams to examine into the crimes of the serial killer. If we saw this along with other types of policeman techniques and standard that we used in 1888 would have been nice to see. It was also good to see a subtle performance by Depp which is not too funny and not too serious.The legendary Jack The Ripper mixed with Johnny Depp seems ideal for thrills and be on the edge for a good movie night..this was not really the case. The movie gets stuck into meat flesh gore and doesn't really look into the mystery of who the killer is by misleading the audience as to who the killer is which is a shame as you know who is behind the murders and the reveal at the end is no surprise. If the filmmakers looked into the conspiracy more and not using 'red herrings' the movie would have been more suspenseful and chilling and mysterious. The murders of the innocent ladies of the night along with the murderer itself felt too caricature and lacked realism. The idea of killing prostitutes who may have a secret so dark it may disrupt the Royal family was intriguing. However this was not utilised enough and the premise behind this was rushed way too quick which is a shame. Rather it focused more on the Heather Graham's character and her romance with Depp and how secret societies were in London which is a separate variable in the movie and complicated the story. If the filmmakers balanced out the different factors of the film maybe it would have been on another level to intrigue the audience.The directors did well with the portrayal of the streets of London which looked gray and grim that helped providing a common theme throughout the film which is darkness and shadows that loom over every character. This also helped creating the murder scenes but the murder itself felt too cartoon style which was a shame along with angles prior to the murder and post murder felt it was giving way too much knowledge of who the killer is. It would have been awesome if the killer's character was developed enough so you know the dark desire of one's soul to give into sinister slasher killings - that would have been chilling. To me the film starts off as a slasher film then transitions to a romance that may blossom, to redemption of a drug addict to a rushed conspiracy which states that the plot itself should have been looked into prior to shooting the movie as it wastes the talents of Depp, Heather Graham, Robert Coltrane and Ian Holm. Overall disappointing as it moves away from Jack the Ripper and focuses more on other themes and subplots - 6.2/10",From Hell

Johnny's performance is quite interesting with him playing an opium- addicted London detective on the case of the infamous Jack the Ripper. Heather Graham as Mary Kelly (a real-life Ripper victim)is a fine foil to Depp's addled Abberline, but the chemistry that develops could take a hike; it's a tacky angle to turn the two character's motives on their heads. The film lacks some real mystery to the Ripper's identity by the finale of the picture since the directors eventually give away who is involved in the case.

It takes a well known series of unfortunate events and gives its own take on it.

It's a movie about watching a series of events and a finale; there're little to no action scenes or whatnot. I have to say I kinda dislike Abberline's take on this movie.

Though Johnny Depp (the brothers' 5th choice for the lead) does a fine job as the film's protagonist (I haven't read Alan Moore's graphic novel yet, so I can't say how this filmic adaptation compares), it certainly would have been interesting to see how any of their previous choices would have done (in order of their preference): Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Connery, Jude Law and Brad Pitt (but especially either of the first two).

113,Mitch-38,GROSSED-OUT ANATOMY,4,21 July 2002,"Pretty standard costumer with a mystery motif, and tons o' gore to keep the adolescents enthralled. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, FROM HELL has much going for it, however the writing tended to be poor and the plot really held no surprises. Johnny Depp rose above the material more than once, and he usually does. Robbie Coltrane was wasted as not much more than a flunky for Depp. Anyone who has seen Coltrane in the British series CRACKER knows this man can act. Heather Graham did a great job, and was wholly believable. Those ""oh so terrible"" British actors, naturally play the baddies. Ian Holm, a mesmerizing actor, takes center stage here and clearly relishes the role. 
The script really sinks the ship. The unsustained and at times, complete lack of suspense brings FROM HELL down to the level of a ""game show,"" in terms of tension. Gratuitous violence never takes the place of suspense, but that doesn't stop screenwriters and directors from trying. Nice try...no cookie. Yes, the crimes of Jack the Ripper were indeed grotesque, however more was spent on faithfully rendering these scenes out, than the effort to peel away the layers of the story and where it was going.
The conclusion bordered on the silly and camp (HM Queen Victoria makes a couple of cameos...good grief!), making the preceding time spent not really worth the while. My conclusion is that FROM HELL is a good costumer, but the overall effect is razzle-dazzle to disguise a stilted and clumsy script.

This film is more than a slasher flick set London during the Victorian era. It contains phenomenal acting by Johnny Depp and Heather Graham who have an unusual chemistry in this movie that works. She was a little too pretty to be an ""unfortuante"" or prostitute in my mind, but it's only a movie afterall. I thought the suspense faded after the first hour but nevertheless explains the Jack the Ripper case in a comic bookish way that is not based on facts but opinion.

118,honorhorror,Romantic Detective VS. Conspiracy Cult?,7,20 February 2010,"From Hell is one of the more famous movie about Jack the Ripper, the series murderer who gutted several prostitutes in London, and left disturbing messages. The reason that his story is highly fascinating, is because this is an unsolved case, and until today, Jack the Ripper is still at large, if you can say so.The movie boasted technical achievements on several levels. The extremely gritty and bleak portrait of London slums is more than an eye candy, if you can say so. That is to say the art decoration of From Hell is literally from baroque era and Balzac. Compared to more recent productions like Sweeny Todd, who also aimed the camera on the slums and dirty gritty side of British glory, From Hell is really more disturbing and depressing to watch because of the social scope and context it examined.It's horrifying because it has a more realistic tone and accuracy on certain levels. When you see the prostitutes being constricted by a rope in a row in a church sleeping, while waiting for their nightfall to work and be killed, you really can't help but feel bad.All the special make-up effects just added more edge to its poignancy and trivial features. Coincidentally and ironically, this movie also stars the brilliant Johnny Depp in the leading role. I can only imagine inspector Abberline chasing down Sweeny Todd in a bloodier scenario. Cheers! However, From Hell's view on a series killer at large is also very stereotypical and intentionally romantic. The way they examine each character and each motivation is full of post-modern skepticism except for the leading role played by Depp. Jack the Ripper is not only a high-ranking royal officer, but essentially a leading conspirator in a cult that controlled England for centuries. If only the decisive historical evidence for this theory can be found, the whole world will shake. Every character who has even a bit of connection to the villains group would ended up a co-conspirator or someone with extremely ugly motivations(even the queen didn't escape this). Perceived by inspector Abberline who is the closest thing to a hero in this movie, everything and every attempt to solve the case is pointless, not only because the case would be covered up consequently but also because the result of his efforts will have nothing to do with him. When he died in the opium house at the end, the movie nailed nothing but the desolation of humanism and faith into our mindset, which is already bleak and hopeless enough. So, allow me to call the movie a elongated depiction of destruction of human souls.Modern skepticism about Christianity is often based on people's perception that churches(or the church if you are catholic) is that this religious group is only one of the many ""players"" in the society who strive for survival, identity and consensus. Yes, no denying that ever since there was a church, there was a corruption in the church, not to mention later eras only brought more power and corruption to it. We really can't ask a person to prove his/her faith is untouched like virgin Mary, but we may still need to have a more balanced perception and thinking of the reality in order to see the original messages in this faith. From Hell provided us with a ""bigger picture"" which is based on many speculations and if considered seriously, insults on certain historic figures. Yet, it holds a ""hero of the humanity"" in the core of its story and spirit, giving people more reasons to adore themselves and the heroism they have each day in fighting their bosses or lifting up an elder citizen from snow. It is only a matter of time until people come to realize that the capital From Hell to ""cushion"" their morality standpoint is a broken one and leads to deeper darkness.Not to mention those nature-born pessimists.

119,Tiger_Mark,Shoddy direction,4,13 November 2001,"This was not a well crafted film. I kept thinking I was watching some made for TV movie of the week. It was supposed to be a mystery, but you would have to be a total dunce to not figure out who the Ripper was. I will give you a hint, it is the obvious choice that the filmmakers attempt to shy you away from. Then there was Heather Graham, the great actress from Austin Powers (do you sense some sarcasm?) Heather Graham's accent kept reminding me of the Gilligan's Island episode where Mary Ann played the cockneyed flower girl. You know the one, where Gilligan was Mr. Hyde? Come to think of it, that episode was scarier than this film. Depp was pretty good, he usually is. However, the story was just not very convincing and full of holes. There were many gadgets and tricks that you have seen a hundred times before and the climax was so predictable. If you don't have an interest in Jack the Ripper, you are not likely to gain one after watching this film. These two brothers made a name for themselves directing gangsta films and I think that is where there strength lies, if they have a strength. Leave the historical based films to better story tellers. This was  ABC & MTV ""go to the movies"" and the result is a film that will leave you wandering what is on TBS later that night. Perhaps I am being too harsh, but as student of the Jack the Ripper case, I felt letdown.",From Hell
120,deadbull-95171,Likely the best of the Ripper movies,10,18 September 2021,"The Kennedy Assassination, Jack the Ripper; are 2 situations that have drawn more conspiracy theories and bizarre speculation then almost any events in history. This one embodies one of the more popular myths and adds a few unique touches, ie. The clairvoyance of Aberdeen and the final substitution kill of Mary Kelly, the final and most notorious murder.These days there have been so many Ripper style murders that is now recognized as a category, with many forensic psychiatric abstracts describing in detail the qualities of psyche that produce this 'type' of behavior.It is not even clear if this particular serialization in jolly old 1888 England was the archetype, but since it has become more prolific, and is usually found to be carried out by independent men of 'special agenda', I tend to dismiss these complex political fantasies, that try so desperately to make the facts support the freakish theories.Typically the handicraft of enraged impotent misogynists, I'm typically highly agnostic, at best, about the wild theorization. Most killers are undetected, and 130 odd years ago, minus DNA and fingerprinting etc., it would be near impossible to catch a single human microbial pathogen in the body of a vast city.This does not in any way impede the excellence of this fantasy. Depp is Depp, great, and Ian Holm. Robbie Coltrane and Heather Graham, are all
excellent too, particularly Coltrane. The plotting is tight, the noir setting perfect, the highly speculative touches, clairvoyance, laudanum addiction, body substitution, the surgeon myth, the political motives, all the usual nebulae that surround the utterly unknowable, are all used to great effect and whatever the realities were, I'm sure this depiction is far more entertaining then the truth, which, as I think and have suggested, is 99.9999% likely to have been a very angry lone nut job with a really serious grudge.I also think the Warren Commission got it right with Oswald, that there is no Santa Claus or Good Tooth Fairy, and that the Government finally 'admitting' UFO sightings are real, is just so much hogwash to divert the stupefied public from looking at the artificially created Pandemic, the digitalization of money, our complicity with China, the fantastic dangers facing this age.....We are only allowed freedom via fantasy, the internet, while our masters
are wiping us out, and that, friends, is no speculative theory.But as we move deeper into corporate slavery and biologically engineered depopulation, (Why Nuke and turn into irradiated rubble the things you want to steal?, just kill all the owners and equity holders......) we can still stay diverted and dumbed down and dehumanized and isolated with the web and the cell phones, all of which makes it easier for the .00000% of the population that will be left, the quadrillionaires, to do away will all political pretensions and just OWN.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, this is a better diversion than most things in its class and genre, elevated, as usual, by the quality of the acting.",From Hell
121,priyantha-bandara,Mundane,5,10 June 2011,"From Hell is based on the true life crime story of Jack the Ripper which took place in 1888 in East London. And it's the screen adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.When the prostitutes on street are getting murdered in a brutal and violent manner, the investigation is given to a young Scotland Yard detective Fred Abberline. Abberline who is already a trouble gentleman with the loss of his wife and child sometime back tries to catch this ruthless killer but finds little luck. The ritualistic manner of the murders and the mutilations seems to be done by someone who is quite experienced in human anatomy.In the mean time Abberline gets to know a set of prostitutes who are in the risk zone and particularly gets friendly with Mary Kelly who agrees to support him with his investigation. And soon he realizes that the murders are not just a work of a mad man but something more than he can personally bring down. As he and Mary starts to get emotionally involved he tries to keep her protected from the killer as she becomes the final prostitute left out of the target bunch.There is nothing new in this flick. It's a mix of horror scenes with a matching score. Other than that it doesn't offer much of a twists or mysteries to go along with. And it's quite predictable.But for a crime and horror fan it is not so boring. The flow of the story is good. There are no lagging or unwanted scenes. And there is a serious work of set creation and representation of London which is perfectly noticeable from the very first scene.Johnny Depp is mundane and Heather Graham is pretty.

122,loza-1,We need another Jack the Ripper Movie like I need a hole in the head!,3,26 June 2005,"Here we go again. Another Jack the Ripper book offering ""the final solution"" comes out, another costume drama is released utilising its contents.Johnny Depp and Robbie Coltrane play real life cops Frederick Abberline and George Godley. Some odd accents here: Abberline has a very lower class accent for an 19th century inspector, Sussex man Godley speaks with a Scottish accent, and Long Liz Stride has hyper-sensitive hearing - being able to hear the sound of Bow Bells in her native Sweden.There is not a shred of evidence to suggest that Abberline took laudanum, although many people at the time did.We have a few sub plots involving a love affair between Abberline and Mary Kelly. We have the royal physician, the Duke of Clarence, the Freemasons.And what was it all about? Well, the Duke of Clarence married a Catholic girl in a Catholic church, and the girls who are being bumped off were in the church. The royal establishment are quite willing to use murder to cover the whole thing up. Sounds like a great idea, BUT, in those days Catholics had to be married twice: once in the Catholic Church, and again in an Anglican church. Why? Because the Catholic priests were not registered to marry legally; so, in the eyes of the law, a Catholic marriage had no legal standing. So we are talking about a film with a busted plot.That aside, the film is well shot, well atmospheric, and has appropriate music.Another problem is that the conditions the girls of Whitechapel are living in are too sanitised. In reality, these folk lived in utter squalor.How many more films are we going to get about Jack the Ripper?",From Hell

Imagine if his biographical movies in the future long after his death, have him tripped out on drugs and his acting talent is depicted as being due to a supernatural force rather than charisma, training, timing and/or any of the other myriad of other things needed to become a Hollywood superstar.The man Depp portrayed, Inspector Abberline of Scotland Yard, was NOT a heroine addicted nor a clairvoyant.

125,jrfranklin01,A Bizarre View of the Ripper Tale,5,27 July 2004,"The classic ""Jack the Ripper"" story has evolved to incorporate clairvoyant inspectors, heavy laudenaum usage, prostitution as prolific as religion, and sacred orders and sects.  This is, in a sense, what this movie is about. 
The serial-killer story is delivered well in London with great  visuals of the times (late 19th century).  And the street life, while horrible, is plausible enough.  But the mysticism that was intended to be created in a psychic inspector's (Johnny Depp) pursuit of the enigmatic ""Ripper"" falls short.  The director should have given Depp a ""Sherlock Holmes"" role and cut the whole visionary bit out, although Depp did play his role well.  
I won't ruin the biggest part of the movie for you, the ""Who dunnit"".  But I must say while the film does good at keeping you guessing, the discovery appears lame and perhaps far-fetched.  The film then really starts to head south as cult-ish intimations develop and later deadlock into a depressing ending that has nowhere to run but down the tubes. 4/10",From Hell
126,senortuffy,Hollywood treatment of the Ripper murders.,6,24 August 2003,"Johnny Depp plays an Inspector Abberline who is assigned to investigate the murders in Whitechapel attributed to Jack the Ripper.  The film follows the theory explored in an earlier film, ""Murder by Decree"" (1979), that the Ripper murders were really the act of a mad palace surgeon who was killing the witnesses to a scandal involving Prince Edward.I can't think of a more unlikely pair of actors to portray Victorian Londoners than Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.  No matter how they tried to cover it up with elaborate costuming and bad accents, I kept seeing a surfer dude and a valley girl on the screen.  Depp is a pretty decent actor but he was just wrong for this role.The supporting cast is pretty good.  Ian Holm is particularly good as Sir William Gull, the mad surgeon who goes about disemboweling the young women. Ian Richardson has a prominent role as Depp's boss, but the script doesn't give him much leeway to act.The production values are slick, and the director went to great lengths to make the sets look authentic, but the film lacked any inner conviction. ""Murder by Decree"" made more of a social commentary about the perversity of the royal family and the social structure of Britain at the end of the 19th century.  Here, sensationalism seems to be the dominant theme.Maybe if the movie had been directed by somebody besides the Hughes Brothers it could have been more complex.  They should stick to hip hop culture.",From Hell
127,Vampenguin,Not bad at all,7,26 March 2006,"This was a pretty good show. Depp is one of my favourite actors, and while this wasn't one of his best roles, he still did a great job as Abberline. I also quire liked Robbie Coltrane as his partner with an affection for poetry, Peter Godrey. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, especially Ian Holm. I loved the atmosphere; though I've heard people complain about it's inaccuracies, I love this romantic kind of portrayal of London: the cobblestone streets, the faint street lights through the billowing fog...makes a great setting for a horror flick. One small problem I had was that the plot seemed to move too fast. There wasn't really enough time for anything to develop, especially near the end. Overall it was a pretty good movie though, I enjoyed it.7/10",From Hell
128,Panterken,Visually stunning genre-transcending film.,7,17 January 2008,"While this comment does include spoilers technically, there's nothing in here that reveals more than a short movie premise...I watched this film many years ago but recently saw it again and felt a strong tendency to write this comment. In 1999 I was only eleven years old and I feel I can really appreciate it more now that I'm older. Don't get me wrong, I liked it when I was a kid, but mainly because I was into horror movies and this movie really scared me.Now, some time later, I do not feel the same way anymore, but instead can appreciate the other things about this film like the colors used, the acting and the various stylish elements applied(the great costumes, etc.)As most of you will know, 'From Hell' tells the semi-fictionalized story of Jack The Ripper, the worlds most notorious serial killer and also one of the first ones and most brutal ones to date. He's known not so much for the quantity of murders, he 'only' made five victims in that dark fall of 1888, but for the brutal way he slaughtered them and the whole mystery that surrounds the murders. The popular rumor that went around London faster than a running fire back then and still lives on today, is that a secret organization called 'the freemasons' was behind the killings, an organization comparable to 'The Skulls' the, let's say, American equivalent. There's no real hard proof for this presumption, but there are some strong leads in the direction. Of course, people like to believe that the magistrates and aristocracy is evil so they are likely to accept this hypothesis without much proof.Now about the movie itself, it has the benefit of a very strong lead cast, with the exception of the unfortunate choice for Heather Graham. She doesn't quite live up to the other actors, but she's not horrible either. I especially dug Robbie Coltrane, but Johnny Depp was fantastic too of course. He proves ones again that he is probably the most versatile actor of his generation, that he's not just 'Jack Sparow' like so many believe. That's a sad thing really, because he's been in some jewels like 'Donnie Brasco' and 'Blow'. What immediately got my attention was the very dark look given to the film, lensed with very intense dark bloody reds, poisonous greens and yellows and a variety of mahogany-ish brown colors. The city of Prague never looked so evil and ominous. Of course Prague is a beautiful setting that lends itself easily to great film-making. Still, I found Prague to be one of the most gorgeous cities of the world, very charming and sweet. To make it look like an evil harbor for the wicked and twisted is really the director's great achievement. It really looked like hell sometimes. There are some other elements that can't be left unmentioned: the repetitive use of the metal stairs of the carriage(the click sounds horrifying for some reason) and the great way in which the first murder is filmed. This proves once again the strength of the power of suggestion. You really make the most horrifying images in your brain, which is so much more frightening than if we'd actually seen the gory images. Of course, later on in the film it gets pretty hard for the weak stomached, but I never had a problem with that.Another great thing about this film, is the fact that it really is a multi-genre one, which is a rare quality these days (I mean this in the best way possible). It's not a horror film, not a pure thriller either, and not a drama. It's a little of all three and that is what makes the film so memorable in my opinion.For those of you who may not have seen it when reading this comment, even though I included a spoiler warning, you might be interested to know that this film is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore, the very same Alan Moore who created the fantastic 'V For Vendetta'. If you loved that, I can almost guarantee that you will like this too...So that's it for my comment, if you're not shocked by the bad quality of this comment than please check 'useful'. I'd appreciate it.A new review in a lil' while, keep track of them if you like, there are 75 now. This film gets 7.7 from me, well deserved.",From Hell

But with all these small details, such as his use of absinthe and opium, just small details, all those pieces just completes the movie as whole.

132,stonedraim,"Stylish with less to offer.. with a ""Hell, yeah!"" (a curse of the pun)",6,4 September 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****Right into the 19th century in the heart of England. The accents, the people and the city gives a breath of the time. Nice little touch with a man giving illegal protection to prostitutes, instead of being the ordinary coupler. Being true to both the age and the country (speaking of the language) raises the bar both for what may come in the movie and also creates the precise and trustworthy frame to ""From hell"". Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba has been able to gather true British talent in seeking of the authentic expression; Ian Holm, Ian McNiece and Robbie Coltrane is just a few there.As of many movies that Johnny Depp is both involved in and also acts in, there is an vast theatrical sense going right through the screen in here. Maybe it fits the 19th century as the story is rolling out into, and maybe it fits anyway. It made me wonder, even so. Interesting to watch with those clear and explicit expressions and acting.The way Jack The Ripper is presented shows what way the producers, the writers and the entire team behind the motion picture wanted to go. The criminal killer is embedded in a gentle costume that has a solitude feeling of a sophisticated count, with the black cape, pure white gloves and the black hat. Add the little toolbox by velvet with knifes and such that is treated with a careful hand, being clean, in order and structured... then you have ""The Ripper"" in here... as a terrifying and hidden monster growing for more... As if being displayed on stage as theatre. Appreciated!Some special effects blended with dark orchestral music creates moments here and there that pushes this film upwards both in entertainment and quality, besides the planning of the mentioned. A picture is taken of the photographer; flash, and a black and white second is being displayed. 28 min and 30 seconds, a blood red sky gives the impression of the pure grit that grips hold of the situation. Astonishing! At 41 minutes, the fast cuts as knifes cuts through the air showing the instruments of dissect, and a filter of strange colour for the screen. The colour of red is recurring here and there, just to underline the stream of blood that is important for the ""refined gentleman that has drops of blood in the wine and eats rare steaks"", Mr. Ripper himself. A delicate touch of art, there.Underneath all this theatrical undertones, expressed acting and the story itself, there lies a clear social question mark; how far will the human being go for the sake of science? Can it be any good in killing innocent people to receive and get the answer for important breakthroughs in medical and scientific matters? Can it be any good in showing horrible diseases as in the old freak shows and circuses, to get the mentioned breakthroughs? Just look at about 46 minutes into ""From hell"". Interesting how Joyce Gallie and Sally Osoba gets the whole storyline together, indeed. Raw brutality and effective and close detective work, plus the atmosphere that it all brings into ""From hell"". In ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", it's ""I ate his liver with a can of beans and a bottle of Chianti"". In ""From hell""; ""I send you half the kidney I took from one woman, preserved for you. The other piece, I fried and ate. It was very nice!"". Psychological frightening. And then, the title being mentioned in its fully state: 1 hour and 15 minutes.Sadly, ""From hell"" only reaches a little above a good movie. To reach for the high and excellent rate, they should have pushed more into the actors, pushed more into the written dialogue both in timing and social expressions as for a more vast and appropriate vocabulary (as some expressions is over used, such as ""these unfortunates"" and ""whores""), more well written screenplay, worked harder for the extras/the figurants to be better, dug deeper for the special effects, pushed harder for the realism and the authentic feeling of the blood and the gore, a more believable and distanced relationship between Abberline and Mary, and created a better soundtrack. Then, ""From hell"" would have taken a better place in movie history.I really want to give this film a higher rate. And.. again, sadly, I will settle with around 6-7.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very well made! Costumes, the era of the century, the society... then some little vague production speaking of let's say the blood. - The actors : Some good, some just above approved. This kind of movie maybe sort the acting out by itself, leaving an experience of art for the viewer. Robbie Coltrane gives a solid touch of the sophisticated yet straightforward English man; nice to see. Heather Grahams attempts to give the character some depth is dearly missed, I might say. They should have gone with some other actress there (to get the innocent prostitute with working moral and social ambition) to grow and be displayed. - Entertainment : Yes. - Age : 15 or maybe even 18. This is due to the grotesque art that the story gives, and also the cruelty, the harsh environment and much nasty gore. Add Jack The Ripper, some horror elements and a mysterious form of script line, and maybe 18.6,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",From Hell
133,DeuceWild_77,"""From Hell"" is stylish and exquisite, but ultimately, lacks substance...",6,7 November 2017,"""From Hell"" was loosely based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, but could have been just a remake of ""Murder by Decree"" ('79), because both of the movies covered the same view / conspiracy theory on the Jack the Ripper's hideous killing spree and his true identity and motivations. The major difference is that in ""Murder by Decree"", the screenwriters used the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous creations, Sherlock Holmes (played by Christopher Plummer) and Dr.Watson (played by James Mason) to hunt Jack the Ripper, but in terms of story / plot is basically the same, except that the 1979 Bob Clark's directed film have, in fact, a heart and soul and substance over style, which ""From Hell"" severely, lacks.The Hughes Bros. came up with a flashy adaptation of the Ripper case, turning one of the greatest unsolved mysteries from the XIX century into a computer game with the player controlling Depp's character who wanders through the movie in a sleepwalking mode, being as inefficient as his Freemason superior, played by Ian Richardson, accused him to be.The script is too predictable, not offering any layers or creative sub- plots, it's 'filmsy', everything appears or happens in the right moment in time to help the plot to move forward (can we even count the 'Deus ex machina' resolutions used, without being bored at it ?).In the technical level, the movie scores as the production / art design, sets and costumes are good in the invocation of the Victorian Era and the gloomy cinematography is competently crafted.In terms of acting, this kind of low life Inspector, addicted to opium, absinthe and laudanum, was tailor made to suit perfectly the Johnny Depp persona, even if his moody performance was too lifeless to carry on the movie. Heather Graham is attractive and likable as Mary Kelly, but she lacks acting chops. The supporting players did better with Robbie Coltrane elevating the scenes with Depp (almost stealing them from him) and Ian Holm, as always, was dementedly fabulous as the main villain. The virtually unknown actresses playing the ill-fated prostitutes (including the late British actress, Katrin Cartlidge as Dark Annie) were very good, especially in the dialect & the authenticity.In short, ""From Hell"" is nice to look at, a visually engaging film, but unfortunately, even with all the style in the world, if it lacks substance and competent storytelling, it fails to achieve.Perhaps this kind of gloomy ""comic book movie"" works better in fantasyland such as in the case of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", which was a critical and box office failure, but at least remained out of a ""based on a real life case"" and was just a dark adventure / fantasy escapism.It worth a watch in a rainy Sunday afternoon, but nothing sort of memorable or a future cult-classic in the genre, if you're a fan of this take on the Jack the Ripper's true identity and motivations, there are far better movies covering the same premise, like the above mentioned: ""Murder by Decree"" ('79) or the earlier: ""A Study in Terror"" ('65) starring John Neville as Sherlock Holmes & Donald Houston as Dr. Watson and featuring an early appearance on-screen by Dame Judi Dench.",From Hell

I guess it was a mostly follow the trail type of movie instead of a murder mystery/suspense.The who dunnit part was mildly interesting, but the intersection of the perpetrator and inspector made the assumption that he was the one somewhat obvious because there were so few other character's personalities or traits revealed that it's as if there was a neon sign pointing to him in the whole scene.  We were lead to believe it was constantly somebody else, but when the murderer was revealed, the thought of ""I don't know why, but I had a feeling it was him"" keeps popping up.Maybe the hallucinations should have been more intertwined with the investigation as opposed to a after the fact confirmation of what the inspector imagined in his mind.Hether Grahm should stick to her usual happy spacy roles, since she seems out of place compared to the other hoarse prostitutes, acting and character-wise.

Depp once again pulls off a bizzare, yet likable man and Graham is great at portraying a streetwalker of the day.

136,Mr. Pulse,A fine mystery with great visuals,7,19 October 2001,"From Hell, based on the expansive (read: phone book length) graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is a strong mystery with great visuals.  The film is even more interesting than I expected; aside from its mysteries and scares, it also has some interesting unsettling elements; some I think were intentional, some not.  The Hughes Brothers impresssed me with some strong visuals and a moody, evocative interpretation of 1880's London, complimenting a retelling of Jack the Ripper as a Seven-ish murder mystery.  Johnny Depp is the Inspector assigned to the case, who also happens to drink heavily, smoke drugs, and hallucinate vital clues to his cases.  Heather Graham is one of a group of prostitutes that Jack has targeted for murder.Graham's Mary Kelly is the movie's biggest problem.  As a gorgeous movie star with a bad British accent, she sticks out from the rest of the fine ensemble as a poor casting choice.  The rest of the prostitutes she pals around with are plain, dirty, and probably more ""realistic.""  Graham's porcelain face and fire red hair stick out like a sore thumb. 
As I said, the rest of the cast is excellent, and the film really gets under your skin.  I've never seen anything by The Hughes Brothers before, but they are visually exciting directors, and I'll be looking into the back catalogue to see what else they've done.  The unsettling elements come in the form of things like Graham as a Victorian hooker and the lack of likeable protagonists, and the ending that is both formula Hollywood and defiant independent cinema.  Often commercial aspects and directorial vision seem to be duking it out, even within individual scenes.  I don't think either side truly wins; we're left with a mixed bag of emotions and styles.From Hell has a few graphic moments of gore that will turn off some of the weaker-stomached in the audience.  And the ending hits as many hollow notes as good ones.  But still, while it's not the most satisfying movie, it is never boring.

But only in one field was I rewarded: the technical credits are impeccible. Victorian London is atmospherically recreated and cinematography is above reproach. However, basically this is a remake of the 1979 film ""Murder by decree"" with minor alterations (mostly concerning the Mary Kelly/Heather Graham-part). And in a comparison this movie is the lesser one almost in every aspect. Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed ""From Hell"" and thought it was quite a good movie.But somehow it never moved me at all. I admired it to be sure, but never really liked it. First of all, the casting has it flaws. Heather Graham is a good actress, but is totally wrong here, looking like a whore who spends all her sparetime at Vidal Sassoon. The other ""girls"" looked more the part and I thought Geena Davis-lookalike Susan Lynch did a good job.Johnny Depp is quite good actually but doesn't compare to Christopher Plummer in ""Murder by decree"". The only parts I really liked was Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm. Especially Holm manages to be very convincing and deliver a surprise or two. The story tries to get away with some surprises and twists also, but you spot them a mile away unfortunately. You get some of the advantages from a big budget here, but also a lot of the disadvantages. The scenery looks just like a scenery and I was never once convinced about the dirt and filth in Victorian Whitechapel.
And, finally, this film didn't have Genevieve Bujold who in ""Murder by decree"", despite very limited screentime, alone managed to bring more pathos and emotion into that picture than every castmember in this one.",From Hell

142,Phantasm01,Very ingtriguing look at the Jack The Ripper case,7,10 May 2006,"Inspector Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp) is not your typical Scotland Yard inspector. He has visions of crimes that he tries to suppress or embrace, depending on his mood, with drugs such as opium, laudanum and absinthe. Luckily, he has Sergeant Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane) to help keep him on task. It is the sergeant who takes Inspector Abberline out to the scene of the first victim in the notorious Whitechapel district of 1888 London. Most of the investigators believe that the slain prostitute is nothing to worry about and not unusual at all given her profession. But Inspector Abberline notices some unusual things about the corpse, like the surgeon-like precision of the wounds and the expensive cluster of grapes near her hand. How could a prostitute afford grapes and what kind of client would have hated her enough to do this? As Inspector Abberline looks into the murder, he comes across Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who knew the victim and is convinced that the local boss is trying to scare them into paying what they owe. But Abberline doesn't think it is that simple. As he spends more time with Mary, he comes to discover that the first prostitute who disappeared left a daughter and that she was no longer working the streets, but had found a special man, an artist, who loved her and was taking care of her. Mary convinces the inspector to find her and Abberline does, but she is in an insane asylum and seems to have the mind of a child. Abberline turns to the noted ex-surgeon Sir William Gull (Ian Holm) to explain the procedure that made her so and to help give him insights on how a surgeon would have used the tools of his trade on the murdered prostitute. The more Inspector Abberline delves into the seemingly unrelated stories, the more he is convinced that they are linked. So when Abberline discovers that the artist lover is in fact the Prince, he suddenly comes to realize that the prostitutes who are being murdered all have one thing in common....This was a very intriguing look at the Jack the Ripper tale with an interesting premise and solution to the seemingly unsolvable and random crimes. The directors did a wonderful job at creating a very dark and creepy atmosphere on the film that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat even when there is nothing scary going on. I also liked their artful visions of the murders and their restraint in showing or not showing details and leaving it up to the viewers imagination to fill in the blanks. Johnny Depp was superb in his role as Inspector Abberline, as he always is, and you found yourself cheering him on and wishing him every happiness, yet knowing that he wouldn't allow himself to be happy. Heather Graham was quite convincing in her role as a poor British prostitute, but her accent was not quite right. However, it is Ian Holm who really fools the viewers and keeps you in suspense as his character rapidly unravels at the end of the film. However, with all of the film strengths I still had to give it 7 stars because it is just missing that certain something that makes a good film a great film. The plot was a little hard to follow at times and I didn't care for some of the characters, but if you are at all interested in the famous Ripper crimes then this is a movie you shouldn't miss!",From Hell
143,emfern13,Brilliant,9,12 May 2002,"This movie was just brilliant. Czech Republic was the perfect place to film this. It's old and it could very well resemble Victorian England. There were very good costumes in this movie, and i was disappointed that it did not get a nomination. The British actors gave powerful performances, especially Ian Holm as William Gull. Johnny Depp delivered a powerful performance too. Heather Graham is not talented but very Hott with red hair and blonde. I actually think she gave a good performance, not like the other actors but good.

Then it got into the action of investigating the Jack the Ripper mystery and, no pun intended, came alive.  The movie is loosely based on facts surrounding the Jack the Ripper murders of prostitutes in London.  One follows Johnny Depp's role as the inspector investigating those multiple murders as well as his love for one.  Once past the first 10 to fifteen minutes, the movie is easy to follow; there are no dull moments.  Fine acting by all and well worth the time to view. I rated it an eight.",From Hell
145,Streetwolf,Why did I bother watching this garbage??,2,17 January 2002,"I guess being from England and having been reading about Jack the Ripper for 12 years from books to movies I finally saw the right movie here in Denmark a few years ago where everything seemed to make sense and it was the mini series with Michael Caine. So my friends and I had to choose between Shallow Hal and From Hell. We figured From Hell would be good since we all were familiar with the story so there wouldn't be any surprises. 27 minutes of the movie and we are in total suspense and something happened and they had to restart the movie once again! So again we sat back and waited for that moment to come again and we figured wow if it was so interesting for the first ½ hour it would no doubt be even better later on! WE WERE WRONG!!! The entire movie suddenly fell out of place and entered a whole other dimension where fact and fiction had to be divided and after dividing it the whole movie became fiction. If they had to base a film on something like that they shouldn't have made a Jack the Ripper film it was almost an insult to what Michael Caine had preformed so perfectly as Abberline. Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there. The real Inspector Abberline was in his late 40's, did Johnny even look past 30? This movie will get a 2 out of 10 and only because the whole setting was terrific and even the special effects with the knife, good! Other than that don't bother it unless you have some extra cash in your pockets and nothing else to do.",From Hell
146,Mr_PCM,Johnny Depp as excellent as ever,8,9 April 2005,"A fresh retelling of the Jack the Ripper legend was probably due, and this Hughes Brothers piece is just the job. It remains faithful to the story whilst throwing in one or two potentially controversial aspects that will leave audiences horrified, but also with a number of talking points.***Spoilers*** The potential link of Jack the Ripper to the royal family has been rumoured for decades but has never been proved. Although this film might have benefited from remaining slightly more ambiguous, nevertheless it is a fascinating tale, though viewers of a nervous disposition are advised that blood abounds.Johnny Depp, as ever, gives a solid performance whilst always injecting human interest into the role. Heather Graham's performance is good but not spectacular, and her Irish accent is a little shaky. Robbie Coltrane is his usual bustling, robust self, and even in the most serious of roles he can be looked to to provide some comedic relief, and he can always convey his relishing of the role. Ian Holm brings the required gravitas to the performance.A superb and fascinating but rather grisly tale, this is not the average mindless Saturday night entertainment, but an excellent murder mystery, and a much needed de-mystifying of the tale.",From Hell

148,RolloTomasi,Conspiracy Theory,7,27 October 2001,"The Hughes brothers have again infused social commentary into their innovative filmmaking. The theme is familiar: The affluent turning a blind eye to the impoverished of 19th century British society echoes much about today's world. Like virtually any period film, ""From Hell"" is intended to reflect something about the present times, demonstrating that no matter how much things change, history repeats itself in different forms.""From Hell"" deals with social issues in its own way. Normally I'd say that art peddled as entertainment should stay off the soapbox unless it's prepared to be serious. ""From Hell"" tries to do both and misses most of the time. Still, it's a decent thriller/murder mystery with a definite horror film structure, but still passes as a historical piece.
The script is where the film runs into its biggest problems.  Foremost of them is that it may take itself too seriously. The slayings are certainly nothing to chuckle about, but some humor would have provided some much-needed balance. They could easily have sacrificed the love story between Abberline (Johnny Depp) and Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), which never finds its feet.Even in the late 19th century, these ritual killings seemed ancient; they were hideous and barbaric, like something out of some long forgotten age, committed by someone whose state of mind should not still exist in a modern society. The killer's savagery woke people up to the enduring possibility of such acts, just when civilization really started to seem civil.""From Hell"" takes liberties with the truth, following closely to the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. It stays faithful to the details of the murders, based on the actual police and coroner's reports. Mary Kelly's post-mortem for instance, is re-enacted verbatim by the examiner. Kelly's murder was the last and by far the most gruesome. Little is actually shown but it's true that your imagination can come up with far worse images than a make-up effects person can.No one ever figured out for certain who the Ripper was, which affords comic book artists and filmmakers the opportunity to romanticize the character for profit--here done at the expense of the royal family (always an easy target) and the freemasons. But at least these artists offer a reasonable, original revelation of the Ripper's identity that just happens to make good cinema.
Grade: B-",From Hell
149,starlit-sky,Each scene is stylish but the movie lacks soul,5,17 December 2001,"From Hell is the story of Jack The Ripper, an infamous serial killer who committed his crimes in the late 19th century London. He is allegedly the first serial killer who killed his victims with sexually related desires. The movie is based upon the comic book by Alan Moore which, probably, is the most reliable source on Jack The Ripper who allegedly selected his victims from prostitutes who witnessed a secret wedding between one of their friends and a prince from the Royal Palace in order to prevent this scandal to be known by the public. This mere fact is enough to suggest that Jack The Ripper, along with orders to kill were from the Royal Family. However, the way he kills victims in a ritualistic way suggests that there were other motives involved other than merely getting rid of the witnesses.
I have to admit that ""From Hell"" didn't turn out to be as good as I hoped it would be. This is a kind of movie where each scene is nicely done but when you put them together they lack soul. Hughes brothers have done everything right, the camera angles, locations, decoration, costumes, acting is good but when all put together, the movie still doesn't have a soul. One of the reasons for my dislike is that the characters don't seem very real. For example, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) doesn't have the look of 19th century prostitute. Directors didn't even bother using some make up effects to make her look like a prostitute. However, all her friends  have more realistic prostitute look, which makes Marry Kelly look even more incongruous. Her relationship with Inspector Frederick George Abberline (Johny Depp) is unnaturally hurried and lacks soul. Inspector Abberline's visions of the murders are haphazard. Does he see them when they are happening or after they've happened? Does he see them when he ""chases the dragon"" (when he is high on opium) or anytime when he feels like it? In one scene, he touches the wall near the crime scene and picks up some visions. I have found his visions to be very chaotic and not adding any excitement to the story at all. They just create some visuals but that's all. The victims are not introduced to the audience in a way that will make them likable. That's why, you don't feel any sympathy when they are murdered. I have found a lack of excitement there too. I have also noticed one technical mistake: in one scene (I guess it was right after the second murder), a cop turns the corner and sees the dead body lying on the sidewalk. You see him right before he turns the corner and after he turns the corner and sees the dead body. There is not one single visible reaction in his movement. He doesn't pace up to rush to the dead body, he doesn't seem to stop for a moment in surprise. From the beginning of the scene to its end, his speed and movements are unnaturally unvarying. What I liked: From Hell is a highly stylish movie with a quite realistic depiction of 19th century London. Costumes, locations, set decoration  and the way the scenes are shot are stylish. It is always nice to watch Johny Depp although this is not one of his best acting performances. The story is very true to the original book in the sense that it grows on all of the characters who were, in reality, accused of being Jack The Ripper. The story, at the end, remains to be loyal to the widely accepted theory.
If you like horror movies and enjoy serial killer themes, there is a great chance you might enjoy From Hell. But if you are expecting a serious movie with a strong plot, rhythm and soul ""From Hell"" is likely to disappoint you.",From Hell
150,culmo80,A good mystery/thriller based on history,7,22 October 2007,"The real Jack the Ripper case is mystery enough, add in some intrigue and conspiracies and it makes for a great story. The film does a great job of transporting you to Victorian London; everything from the clothes and buildings to the attitudes of ""non-civilized peoples"" really set the mood. There were a few problems; Heather Graham always appears to have just stepped out of the shower. For being a common street prostitute, she is remarkably clean and tidy. Her accent seems to come and go at some points as well. Johnny Depp does a good job as the conflicted inspector and Robbie Coltrane is as usual perfect (of course he didn't have to pretend to be English). Ian Holm also was very good.Spoilers:As for the plot line, it keeps you involved. There are enough misdirections so that you're suspecting the wrong people through most of the film. The idea that the Jack the Ripper was involved in a Masonic plot to protect the Royal line was a bit far-fetched though. Also, at one point, Ian Holm says he can no longer practice medicine because of a medical condition yet he states that the Ripper would have to have a steady hand...now perhaps the doctor was able to have steady hands by taking absinthe and laudanum.Overall, it was pretty good. It's worth your time to watch. There's some nudity and sexual content as well as a lot of violence (though it is done in short bits so you know what is happening but don't actually see it).",From Hell
151,kismit,A decent effort with a weak script.,7,31 October 2001,I had high hopes for this film. I very much enjoyed Sleepy Hollow and Murder By Decree so this one looked like a lock. Depp's bleak protagonist and his sidekick Coltrane worked well but could not rise above the material. A few breaths of the real London of the time-the dosshouse where the women slept against a rope and the Ten Bells tavern(still around today almost as it was then)but the conspiracy angle was handled better in Murder By Decree.

The script was well written with some changes from the novel and the cinematography along with the special effects were superb.

153,mfnmbvp,'From Hell' (2001),9,25 April 2012,"There are so many things that I love about 'From Hell' that it is difficult to begin somewhere. We can just thank The Hughes Brothers up front for directing this masterpiece, be it that their entire theory on Jack The Ripper was false or not, is arbitrary to the fact that 'From Hell' is well-made, well-acted, and very highly underrated. This probably got lost for many people in a flush of Johnny Depp films that would invade popular culture for the next decade to come, but fresh off the heels of making Tim Burton's 1999 'Sleepy Hollow', Johnny Depp plays this Sherlock Holmes-esque character well, and intriguingly, even if the accent might seem a little over-the-top, a decade later.The art direction is also highly notable, based on the graphic novel, which I haven't read, I can just imagine that there are plenty of panels in the comic depicting the ominous blood red London skyline. Beautiful. The costumes and set pieces are all very nicely done as well. Robbie Coltrane is great as Depp's sidekick, and underrated also much of the time. Heather Graham isn't anything spectacular, and she's no Christina Ricci, but she fills her shoes well. Ian Holm is spectacular, and this was probably my first real introduction to him.You will probably have to watch this film several times to really get the entire gist of it, because the plot could seem complicated if you aren't familiar with the theory The Hughes Brothers used. Indeed, I hope one day Depp can possibly conjure up an idea with someone as visionary as The Hughes Brothers yet again and bring us another true classic type, such as films like 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'From Hell' are. In my opinion, this is an absolute forgotten masterpiece of recent cinema, and highly overlooked.FROM HELL -----9/10.",From Hell
154,thehardyboyz2043,"Good, good stuff, with one really big flaw.",9,22 October 2001,"(Possible spoilers) ""From Hell"" is a visually arresting thriller that follows the killing spree of the oh so infamous Jack The Ripper, which take place in 1888 London, according to the film that is.   Johnny Depp plays Inspector Frederick George Abberline, a man who can see the murders before they happen, which is done by taking lots of opium and then slipping into a dreamlike state. The murder victims are prostitutes and soon after inspecting a couple of the bodies Depp begins to realize that the killer may be killing these ladies as a form of punishment, not for money.  The story of the film, although confusing at times, does make quite a bit of sense and the movie's pretty intriguing, until the last five to 10 minutes, which seem very rushed and because of the not very good, when compared to the rest of the picture. That's just the one problem that hurts the film. The other one is Heather Graham, whose phony and downright ridiculous accent plagues any scene she's in and just proves how miscast she is in the movie. Her acting isn't all the great either. Oh and also Ian Holm plays an old doctor, who is pretty fascinating to listen to, even if he seems a little off. But Holm does play his role well and does add some depth to the cast of the movie.
 Depp is by far the best of the bunch, as he always is. I'm not sure why he hasn't gotten noticed as much as actors like Mel Gibson, Tom Hanks or Harrison Ford (to name a few famous ones), he's just as good if not better than all three. But Depp does turn in a great performance as Inspector Abberline, his British accent is very convincing and he delivers his lines with a lot of power.   ""From Hell"" is not the best picture of the year, but it does come close on some fronts, with only the ending and Graham's performance keeping it from being truly fantastic. But the visual style, both in the real world and in Depp's visions is very impressive and for the most part the acting is exceptional, again, except for Graham. Sure the film is pretty gory in certain parts but that's what you should expect from a movie whose villain is Jack The Ripper and the violence doesn't hurt the picture in any way. I'll say ***1/2 out of 4 stars.",From Hell
155,smokehill retrievers,"Cheap knockoff, an insult to Depp's talent",1,24 June 2002,"I'll watch anything with Depp or Ian Richardson, which is how I got skinned on this PPV rental. For God's sake, do NOT spend money on this sad little ripoff of Murder by Decree -- but with far less talent and entertainment.The plot was ""new"" 20 years ago but thoroughly discredited long ago as being too silly for words. Even Depp's great Cockney acccent was completely out of character for a Scotland Yard inspector, but the portrayal of one pinup-quality whore amongst a thousand utter dogs was just annoying...as was her accent and acting. The storyline was erratic (even where it made sense), and the so-called ""mystery"" was obvious early on. The errors or misrepresentations about the Ripper murders were phenomenal, and only someone totally ignorant of the case could get sucked in at all.
Depp is one of the most talented actors around, but even he can be grossly miscast in awful movies (""Blow"" coming to mind immediately). One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in ""Sleepy Hollow,"" which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.There are several interesting (and even believable) speculations on the Ripper murders, and of course most scholars have a pretty good idea who it probably was (hint: it wasn't a doctor, a royal prince or a Freemason). Surely we could have been given an interesting premise that didn't have just class prejudice going for it. This really did suck.

The Hughes brothers have created a very dark, bleak, infested London here. It is shockingly realistic. Almost immediately, the film offers many suspects as to who the real Jack the Ripper might be. Not trying to sound clever here, but, I knew who the killer was very early on, as I also believe, after many conversations with people, that Jack the Ripper was indeed who this film makes him out to be! And the motive? Ah, the motive is pure gold! I hadn't thought of it like that before, but my God, it makes every bit of sense!London looks like some kind of ghetto here, and the mood is set for a thriller that will indeed shock many of it's viewers. The brothers do very well not to completely step into the 'slasher' genre - thank God! But the murders, or what we see of them , are very realistic.Johnny Depp, always a favourite actor of mine, does well in his role as a detective who is fighting, well not really, coming to terms with really, his addiction to opium. Poor sod. As far as performance goes, he is solid, but his accent does, at times, waver between cockney and Australian, but he stays with it, and we believe his performance. Heather Graham on the other hand, is slightly less convincing as Mary Kelly, one of the five prostitutes who have information that is worth their lives. Irish is she? Whatever you say guv'nor. Beautiful though!The story, if your not concentrating, is kinda complex. You don't need a degree in Ripperology to 'get' this film though, it's a stand alone depiction of one of many theories that surround the Ripper murders. It's gruesome to think that this actually went on.At one point though, I was so caught up in the film, that I forgot the theory that I had clutched to throughout and created a new one to coincide with the film's narrative...Johnny Depp's 'visions' might not have been visions, it could have been him that committed the murders, in an opium induced state. At the time it made sense, and it still does now, it was a 'Fight Club' type twist that I had conceived. Interesting though!The supporting cast are great, Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane do remarkably well in their roles respectively.The ending is welcome.

European critics also seemed to like the movie more than their American colleagues. Our local newspaper, for example, gave the movie a pretty good review.      From Hell is actually quite similar to Tim Burton´s gothic masterpiece Sleepy Hollow which also starred Johnny Depp. Both movies are dark and old-fashioned horror movies.

I first heard of it after reading an article i n a British film magazine, of all places. The plot, characters and setting quickly had me believing that this was going to be ""Sleepy Hollow Redux,"" which is never a bad thing.As with the aforementioned 1999 Tim Burton masterpiece, Johnny Depp plays a Brit-accented police detective who tries to solve a series of grisly murders. Whereas ""Sleepy Hollow"" retells the legend of the Headless Horseman, ""From Hell,"" directed by the Hughes Brothers, does likewise with the legend of Jack The Ripper, who, unfortunately, was never apprehended for his crimes.However, that's where the similarities end.While ""From Hell"" is by no means a letdown, I found that ""Tomb Raider"" had more in common with ""Sleepy Hollow"" than this did, but that's another story. It doesn't mean, though, that it's not entertaining. And yes, it has an engaging plot, though I had to see the film twice to fully get the gist of it.As always, the ever-versatile Depp steals the show. He stars as Fred Abberline, a drug-addicted inspector who sees visions of brutally murdered women in his narcotic-hazed dreams that ultimately come true. One thing leads to another and he is soon saddled with a serial murder case in which a group of gravely down-and-out prostitutes inhabiting London's sleazy, unpleasant Whitechapel District circa 1888 are being murdered one by one by a killer who is bedecked in a top hat and billowing cape and whom the public has nicknamed Jack The Ripper. He then takes his madness a step further and removes his victims' organs postmortem.To put it bluntly, this ain't Mary Poppins, folks. There are no homogenized visions of merry old England to be found here.Heather Graham plays alongside Depp as Mary Kelly, one of the circle of dirt-poor hookers who, while not being slaughtered, are constantly harassed and hounded by a seedy gang  call them Victorian-age pimps, if you will  for whatever small change they can scrounge up.The killer's ""surgeries"" cause Abberline to seek help from Dr. William Gull (Ian Holm), who just happens to be the physician to the royal family (and who has developed a skin-crawling medical treatment known as a `prefrontal lobotomy'). Their partnership ultimately reveals an exciting twist in the plot.Ian Richardson is effective as Abberline's pompous, anti-Semitic superior (he immediately believes a Jew is responsible for the killings), as is Robbie Coltrane as the inspector's sidekick, confidante and sounding board.I'm always in the mood for a good murder mystery film, and ""From Hell"" fits the bill nicely. I liked how little clues were peppered around the crime scenes, ranging from how the hookers' throats were slashed (""The cut goes from left to right; the killer is right handed,"" Dr. Gull surmises early on), to Abberline finding an empty sprig of grapes and detecting the scent of a potent alcoholic drink laced with laudanum on the victims' breaths.Plot and acting aside, the real standout of the film is Martin Childs' production design. The backgrounds and sets are so believable that one would never guess that the film was entirely shot in the Czech Republic, which it indeed was. The cinematography by Peter Deming brings viewers up close and personal to the action; it's almost as if you're part of the movie yourself as the characters stroll through Buckingham Palace or a dark alley. The exterior master shots of London are so beautiful that they look more like paintings borrowed from an art gallery.There are no real negatives about this film; my only gripes were that the scenes involving Dr. Gull's medical procedures and John Merrick (the Elephant Man) served only to shock the audience and did little to advance the plot, and it also seemed rather odd that Jack The Ripper would have a partner in crime (a nervous, bottle-swigging carriage driver played by Jason Flemyng), which, as a result, doesn't make him as imposing as he should have been. The flow of the movie is distracted in the third act when another woman, passed off as a French friend of one of the prostitutes, is suddenly thrown into the pot from out of nowhere for no known reason other than to apparently add to the body count.Yes, the term has become cliché, but ""From Hell"" is definitely not for the faint of heart. While the blood and gore is censored to some extent in the first act, more full-bleed (no pun intended) shots of the carnage are seen as the film progresses, and everything goes whole hog in the ending.What attracted the brothers Hughes to this film was the opportunity to make a period movie about street violence (a genre that hasn't been beaten to death enough already), which is a thin motive in itself. While it's not groundbreaking for the genre by any means - it lacks what made ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Seven"" so spellbinding  it holds its own, though my mother noted that it was like watching ""Murder By Decree"" all over again.All comparisons aside, ""From Hell"" is a nice, if sometimes grisly, little piece of cinematic heaven. 8/10",From Hell
160,csrothwec,A silly film with very little appeal beyond three good performances by supporting actors.,5,28 February 2009,"Where to start? To begin with, the plot has already been filmed in an adequate (and vastly more entertaining) manner in the 1979 film with Christopher Plummer and James Mason 'Murder by decree'. Secondly, Johnny Depp's 'English' accent must be well up there for the Dick Van Dyke 'cod-English, 'gor, blimey, govn'r'' Award - it is so abysmal that you LONG for another of the 'opium den'/'vision' scenes because one knows that at least he will keep his mouth shut and spare one's ears. The 'opium den' scenes themselves, and the role they 'play' in the script, are also themselves the height of silliness, even if they play the 'key' role in the final scenes and the 'saving' of Depp's sweet-heart. The whole role and everything about the latter ('Mary Kelly') is also virtually 'off the silliness scale'. As usual with films about Jack the Ripper, the producers want it both ways; revelling in the filth, poverty, gore, diseases and total cheapness of and disregard for human life prevalent in the slum areas of London in the 1880s, whilst, of course, portraying the lead, especially female, characters, as if they had actually nothing to do with such surroundings. The police photographs and crime scene sketches of the time, to which the film refers at many stages, show the real Mary Kelly (as with all of the other victims of the Ripper) for what they actually were - wasted, emaciated, disease-ridden and broken women, decades old before their time. The 'Mary Kelly' of this film, with her fresh complexion, beautiful 'Pre-Raphaelite' auburn hair, spotless clothes and bright, assertive expression is a travesty of the reality. If, however, 'Kelly's' general appearance and demeanour are shams, wait until the final scene when she escapes to a 'designer' cottage directly on the coast of Ireland with her 'rescued daughter' and decides to devote her life to bringing up the latter in healthy,clean and invigorating surroundings rather than the rat-infested slums of the East End of London - I say, what a terrific idea! A VERY silly ending to an extremely silly film which deserves to be totally forgotten and left to the type of murk and dark obscurity in which most of it is shot and which even makes the physical act of simply watching almost as disagreeable as waiting for the 'plot' to unfold. The ONLY saving graces were the performances of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm and Ian Richardson (the latter's appearances, though, being far too brief).",From Hell

But what I got was pathetic art film it was just a mediocre adaptation of a comic book.From Hell (Spoilers******) 20th Century Fox brings the cinematic version of the graphic novel written by Alan Moore. England during 1888 a mysterious killer starts to murder poor prostitutes, for searching him Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) was brought to the case. Even after his strict surveillance the killer continues to hunt down more prostitutes. Things went more darker when a young prostitute named Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) enters Abberline's life. Soon Abberline found that each victim was connected and the killer was some one from the Royal Family.Directed by the Hughes brothers (Allen and Albert) tells the unseen story of the notorious killer Jack the Ripper. I don't know why they treat such hard core theme to a sucking art film. It has no tension, no forcefulness, and no suspense. Or is that because of they feared Alan Moore's creativity, or a NC-17 rating, they cheated all the die hard fans by creating such lame movies based on a Great materials.I give this movie 1 out of 10.From Hell = Dull Hell.",From Hell

Depp's character is a bit hard to relate to because he spends a lot of time in a drug-induced haze, even though he is lucid enough while on the job. He'd be nowhere without the friendship of his sidekick played by Coltrane Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is it is hard to see Inspector Abberline's (Depp) motivation to solve the murders, at least until he develops some interest in one of the potential victims, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham). Even then he seems so lightweight that he could just be blown away. An atypical hero.A very good choice for a weekend rental.",From Hell
163,wbhickok,Why Ian why?...,3,21 November 2001,"First off, let me state that the person behind this script knows very little about the Jack The Ripper killings. I have bad news for people out there, Sir William Gull was NOT Jack The Ripper. I am not saying I know who is, many theories abound, but the 'Queen Victoria sending her personal physician out to kill the prostitutes that gave her son VD' is one of the more laughable. Secondly, Johnny Depp simply could not emit a convincing British accent. Don't get me wrong, he is a damn good actor, but he was in way over his head with this one.If you need to see a good Jack The Ripper movie, I would recommend Hitchcocks' ""The Lodger""",From Hell
164,Nigel St. Buggering,Victorian London via Hollywood,5,22 October 2001,"Going into this film, I had to realize that I am a great fan of the graphic novel; I consider it to be one of the great works of graphic storytelling, along with ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Watchmen"".  It is, therefore, somewhat difficult to put aside any bias I might have had toward this film from the beginning.  I did try, but it certainly didn't make it easy.First, just to start off light, for the good points: the film is visually quite arresting.  The sets, the cinematography, the camera work, all work together to create a very interesting vision of 1880's London.  It isn't what you'd call a realistic vision, but it is interesting nonetheless. Unfortunately, visually stylistic films are a dime a dozen these days.  It takes more than that to impress.Sadly, the film doesn't have much else.  The Hughes brothers are obviously quite familiar with the novel, but sadly, they've only picked out the seedy trappings of it, and left out what really made it work.  Where the novel extensively examined the world in which Jack went about his work, the film ditches all of that and settles instead on a standard murder mystery.  We've seen this story a hundred times in countless modern serial killer thrillers. By keeping the identity of Jack a mystery, and following the investigations of Inspector Abberline, they have reduced the story to something very drab and unoriginal.Among the worst touches is Abberline's psychic ability.  The ""vision"" sequences are more annoyingly modern than creepy, and really don't seem to help him much in his investigations, or aid the story in its journey.  They simply add an unwelcome supernatural element to events based (however loosely) on reality.  I can only imagine that the film-makers' intention was to combine two characters from the novel.  However, the novel's ""psychic"" admitted to being a fraud.  So why is this here?A Hollywood product mentality is found throughout the production.  While the supporting whore roles are filled out very believably, Heather Graham is instead cast in the role of the ""Friday The 13th"" virgin who is immune to harm because we never see her engaging in sex.  She stands out like a sore thumb among the grime with her colorful dress and pretty hair and makeup. They've done away with Abberline's marriage in order to make way for a romance with Heather Graham's ""whore"".  And the mistaken-identity ending sets up a conclusion so saccharine as to belong in a Shirley Temple movie.In the end ""From Hell"" turns out to be nothing more than a standard Hollywood serial killer movie with the words ""Jack the Ripper"" inserted into it.  5 out of 10.",From Hell
165,H_Spengler,"Awful, an insult to Depp and Coltrane",2,15 June 2009,"This was a depressing, awful, dark, dank, and damp (OH GOD was it ever damp, This version of London has to be the wettest i've ever seen.)Although going full well into this movie knowing it was based on the macabre and mysterious Jack The Ripper, it was more depressing, insulting, boring, and bland than it was suspenseful and scary.It's sad too, because it appears the Hollywood machine went full force in recreating 19th century London, CGI, costumes, and props. It Could have been a great, terrifying suspenseful mystery adventure. Instead it takes a little Alan Moore, history, and mixes in a terrible script. I actually cringed at the awful, screeching Cockney accents provided by the non British/UK actors and actresses. (Depp was OK though, his being mellow and not seemingly screeched at the top of his lungs like the ""unfortunates"" was.)There was no chemistry what-so-ever between Depp and Graham, at no time was I convinced of their attraction to each other, or of their predictable ""romance"", if you could call it that. Depp seemed to sleepwalk his way through most of this picture, (I wish I could've done the same.) The ""unfortunates"" are portrayed as the dumbest group of screeching harpies I have ever seen spread across the screen. How many moments of stubborn pride ""I won't take charity from nobody"" ""I'm not a whore"", ""I wasn't always a whore."" ""I need to work to live/eat."" moments did you count? Especially from Graham? Even late into the movie, as all her friends lay horribly slain, she still stubbornly sticks her nose in the air with these ideas rather than just taking the money offered to her (and at this point it should be quite obvious that it's not someone trying to get in her pants) and getting the hell out of dodge. It's nothing more than a bad script setup to share a ""passionate"" kiss with Depp.The killer story, for one of the most infamous and gruesome murderers in all of history is really quite boring, and lacking any mystery and aforementioned ""suspense.""I felt sorry for Depp and Coltrane, I really did. Having seen them both in much, much better roles, at least the friendship and work between the two of them was comfortable and convincing. It's too bad that no one involved in writing/producing/directing this disaster decided that anyone else should be.Want to see a movie done right with Depp as a detective?

166,ayric,Decent Ripper,7,21 December 2001,"Jack the Ripper is a perfect story for a film, and the result is quite creepy. Actually a little too creepy. There is some gore and a few really disturbing scenes in this film and it gets a little speculative. I have no idea what the Elephant Man had a cameo for. It seems as The Hughes Brothers are more interested in shocking the audience than to stick to the story. This is only a theory of who The Ripper was, as no one really knows. The film is very stylish, painting 19th Century London blood red. Johnny Depp is solid with his usual melancholy.   From Hell is a very good thriller but it could have been stripped down a little, actually adding to the chilliness. Rating: 7/10",From Hell

168,Baldrick44,I don't know what it's trying to do...,7,21 April 2007,"From Hell has its moments as a movie. However, it is also an opportunity lost because people wanted to take a safe option instead of the one that was offered to them.The plot revolves around Fred Abberline ( Johnny Depp ), a London investigator who is on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he leaves a trail of mutilated bodies through the Whitechapel district of London. High up on his list seems to be a group of prostitutes- one of which is Mary Kelly ( Heather Graham )- who confides in Abberline in the hope that the Ripper case may be solved. However, soon, both the inspector and Kelly, along with the trusty sergeant ( Robbie Coltrane ), see that the trail may lead to echelons of society far higher than they could possibly imagine.This, in itself, does seem like a good plot for a movie. However there are a couple of big problems that stop it from working. One is that Abberline has 'visions' when under the influence of opium which seem to be a half-baked excuse by the Hughes Brothers to show London in a different light and it doesn't really work. This compounds the second problem, which is that there is no real mystery element to the plot, instead he comes up with a vision which helps him figure it out.The performances are varied with Depp good as Abberline and Graham average as Kelly but it is the English supporting cast of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson as his police chief and most strongly, Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, which makes the atmosphere come alive. To add to that is an amazingly dark score and a great set in Prague which makes Victorian London seem as real and malevolent as ever.From Hell is a sort of a halfway house between a brilliant Alan Moore graphic novel which portrayed things from the view of Jack the Ripper and a straight out period murder mystery and it's this compromise that sees it fail. One wonders if the plot was changed just so they could get someone like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham into the star credits.",From Hell

171,asphyxion_,A fascinating transition for the Hughes Bros.,8,2 January 2020,"Known for their hard-hitting, well crafted cult-classic 'hood' films Menace II Society and Dead Presidents, From Hell represents an exciting transition for a familial duo of directors known usually for their street-savy tales of karma and retribution.From Hell is visually stunning; Whitechapel District is immaculately recreated thanks to the backbreaking sweat of 140 Craftsmen and crew members working relentlessly over a twelve week period on a 20 acre plot to construct one of the finest sets ever seen in a period piece of the Victorian era.Superb writing and the immersive acting from the movie's forerunners resurrects the nightlife of 19th century London for the big screen and the careful attention to detail borne of what is obviously rigorously-researched history really showcases some of the film's most fascinating scenes. Opium dens and sanitariums and morgues are seedy, gritty and absolutely thriving with an electric sense of tantalizing dread and morbidity. Icepick lobotomies and vivisection make some onscreen cameos, so if you're the squeamish type than From Hell will be a difficult watch for you.Regardless of any sort of revisionism or dramatic licensing, From Hell is a riveting watch from the first minute to last. The trademark Hughes Brothers nihilism is peppered throughout the film, however their signature 'come uppance' climax seen in Menace/Presidents is absent here, marking another transition for the brotherly team as well as showcasing their capacity for artistic growth.The Hughes Bros. know damn well how to make an addictive and stylish crime thriller, and From Hell is no different. They've created a masterful piece of cinema here and anyone jonesing for a fantastic murder mystery would do well to give From Hell a late-night, lights-out viewing. Johnny Depp and Ian Holm are of particular note here for their outstanding performances.

173,mikepwong,Dark audacious thriller,7,30 November 2003,"Rating: 7 out of 10. Directed by Albert Hughes and Allen Hughes.'From Hell' stars Johnny Depp as police Inspector Fred Abberline investing a series of murders in the Whitechapel area of London. His partner is Sergeant Peter Godley played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, an Irish prostitute that helps Abberline with the investigation.
Abberline is an opium addict whose dreams provide a clairvoyant insight into his investigations. In fact, the movie opens and ends with Abberline in an opium den. Depp does a great job with this character, showing the viewers that his acting ability improves as he ages. The story has a number of subplots that are interconnected. The Royal family is somewhat involved due to a little problem in their family that could cause a scandal; we see a secret society that is linked to Royalty and the government - even Abberline's superior officer is a part of this group; there is also a secret police described as the Special Branch involved with the plot. To top it all off, an appearance of the 'Elephant Man' makes its way into the movie. All these subplot points make this movie sound like an 'X-Files' story. 'From Hell' is dark and violent, similar to 'Se7en' and '8mm', yet the first three-quarters of the movie is quite stimulating. In my opinion the movie doesn't finish well. The alternative last scene shown on the DVD special features would have been better since it would have been less ambiguous with what happens to Abberline after the case is closed.",From Hell

I was very excited when these scenes were shown. Unfortunately, those scenes turned out to be few and far between. From a director's point of view, I believe they were used as an instrument to catch the audience's attention.Unfortunately, the movie doesn't follow up with with that momentum.

The Hughes Brothers were in love with the freaky dream sequences and imagery (which were interesting visually), but left the plot hanging.

The Hughes Brothers have really captured a stylised picture of the hellish conditions of Whitechapel in 1888.This also goes for the musical score that complements the sometimes psychedelic visuals.As for the crimes of the Ripper at least 3 are recreated with painstaking attention to detail.Unfortunately those who have a real interest in the Rippers crimes and even Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel are left seriously wanting.As for what I found wanting.The storyline is a bit of a mess. With to many unassay characters. This wouldn't have been a problem if the film makers had followed the novel where many theories are explored. Unfortunately they went with one storyline ( the most outlandish) that most know the plot too, and these day holds very little water.The script doesn't help the actor's as it make the police seem either stupid or incompetent, relying on Abberline's psychic abilities than actual police work.Actually the police work for the time was excellent and police explored every avenue of enquiry. The case notes were as good back then as they are now. Unfortunately forensics were in a very early stage of development. None of this is shown in the film.The acting seems to be kind of indifferent especially from Depp.. Heather Graham tries hard but its obvious that she did absolutely no research into her character. This can also be said of the other actresses who played the victims.For example (Mary Jane Kelly most probably never had a cockney accent. It is thought that she was born in Ireland and spent most of her life in the west of England and some time in Wales before coming to London in her late teens/ early 20's) Also Liz Stride was actually Swedish again coming to London in her 20's).Catherine Eddowe's was in custody for being drunk. She was released and around the time of the Stride murder and herself was dead less than a hour later.Also I could never work out why the final murder was presented as a total mirror image of the official crime photograph.This all sounds like a bit of a gripe on my part, but I just think they missed an opportunity to make the definitive Jack The Ripper film.

Performances are good all round (especially to the two stars Catrin Cartlidge and Lesley Sharp last seen togethor in the Mike Leigh classic 'Naked'). Very well shot and stylish backdrops helped provide the movie's gothic setting giving London a truly creepy touch.My only disspointment was that the murders weren't so shocking and brutal as I'd come to expect (maybe the Hughes Brothers should've looked at some Giallos of Lamberto Bava or Dario Argento in order to help gain more reference to the blood and gore portrayed).Overall not a bad attempt, though it was a tad bit dissapointed. 6/10",From Hell

182,TexMetal4JC,Absolutely incredible,9,22 October 2001,"From Hell is quite the work of art. When the ideas of infusing artinto cinema were produced, From Hell is obviously what wasthought of. But the question is whether From Hell's grandiosebeauty translates into the genius of Salvador Dali or the overblownfluff of Jackson Pollock.On the one hand, the photography is simply stunning. The realismis amazing. The depiction of the London of Jack the Ripper,Charles Dickens and Sherlock Holmes is stunningly realistic. Thesociety created by the film makers is amazing to watch in of itself.Also, Johnny Depp shows that he is one of the best actors of ourtime. Granted, his role as the police inspector trying to find theRipper is not dissimilar from his role in Sleepy Hollow, but whyshould that matter? From Hell is an excellent movie to watchimmediately after taking in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas andBlow to realize what an incredible actor he is.The movie contains vast amounts of violence, yet it is portrayedtastefully and seems necessary to the movie, even if it's not all thatimportant to show the blood and guts. It almost strips From Hell ofits horror label because the brothers Hughes found ways to showgutted prostitutes and still raise the movie above the slasher-goregenre.The plot works like a modern-day version of an Agatha Christiebook. We're given the parts fairly soon, and we watch the inspectortry to figure it out. This is much different from the other intelligentcrime-horror flicks of late: Se7en, Kiss the Girls and In Dreamsfeatured loonies we never met until late in the movie. The Watchertold us who it was the whole time. But From Hell shows us thekiller, as well as several clues throughout the movie, but theending is still a surprise when Depp reveals it. How refreshing!The plot also runs on several levels, adding in seeminglydisjointed pieces (Anne and the Masons, for example) yet putting itall together at the end.The ending of the movie is probably the most non-climactic endingto a horror movie the last ten years. Strange that this movie buildstoward a climax that never happens, yet the ending still leavesviewers satisfied.But not all is well with From Hell:Heather Graham isn't dirty enough. If she's a prostitute, then sheshould be a dirty whore. But she's not. She's the clean-faced,red-haired, smiling one that stays out of the fray while her friendsare slaughtered in unspeakable ways. After all the effort to makethe surroundings realistic, would a little charcoal on the cheekshave been too much to ask?Besides which, Heather Graham couldn't even act in AustinPowers, what ever made the film makers believe she could act ina horror-thriller based on semi-historical events and acontroversial novel? Sorry. Heather Graham joins Mira Sorvino infailing the ""first major serious role"" test.Someone in the editing room got a little too happy at the beginningof the movie. At some point in the middle of a string of murders,did someone not think to stop and say, ""Hey but do you thinkanyone would mind if we showed more than two uninterruptedseconds of a single viewpoint?"" In some cases, the splicing anddicing of the film works, but it gets old pretty fast, and horror fansmay be wishing they could play some scenes in slow motion.
The ending is also a potential weak point. The nega-climacticending leaves the possibility for the audience to walk out of thetheatre with no lasting impression of the film, except a lot of dark.This is dangerous. Bold and gutsy, and I subtract no points for itsince I found it appealing, but it is dangerous, none the less.Overall, From Hell is the third excellent horror movie released thisyear (Hannibal, The Others, sorry haven't seen Joy Ride orJeepers Creepers yet). It is dark and disturbing. The horror doesn'twork on a shock/scare factor, but rather on a psychological/fundamental level. Audiences won't scream in terror,but many will find the movie horrifying.

     The hero is an opium addict who has ability to envision tomorrows murder, today. He is supposed to be very smart. At one point he is drawing locations of different spots where bodies were recovered, and based on that he figures out that this has some significance in terms of some cult and predicts the location of next murder. At that point he had a good idea that the reason those women were being murdered was that they were witness to a wedding of some loser prince and somebody wanted them to be eliminated. My question is, why didn't he post all the idiot cops right outside that ONE room where all of those women lived? Wouldn't it be easy to just ask a pair of cops to FOLLOW the remaining two or three women in that ONE room? He knew who was getting killed, and why, yet there were cops everywhere but outside that one spot. This is level of idiocy not seen before in any crime movie.    Another question: Shouldn't the hero have told the remaining women, NOT TO TALK TO STRANGERS WHO GIVE YOU GRAPES? How about questioning couple of fruit vendors? He also knew the killer was rich and educated, and there were more than one suspect at hand. Yet Jack-The-Rip-OFF gallops through those narrow streets in his carriage, and no one seemed to take a note.
    The dialogue, the acting, the sets, the cast, the characters, were so horrible, that I found myself rooting for Jack! His acting was best in whole movie, but could not save it from being one of the worst movies ever made.

184,ga-bsi,What A Film,8,1 June 2009,"This film is wonderful. It's so powerful dark and brilliant. Johnny Depp is absolutely magical and enthralling as Inspector Abelaine. The mood of the film is so excellent and contributes greatly to the content of the film. Some will say that too much poetic license was used, but analyzing this movie is boring and stupid. The casting is superb, the sets wonderfully authentic and the costumes a colourful array representing the 19th century. Heather Graham gives one of her only good and solid performances as Mary Kelly. It is a simply masterfully executed film with twist and turns, and the thrilling execution of a well trained butcher.",From Hell
185,littlesb,"Dark, surrealistic journey into Victorian England",7,9 June 2002,"I was not too excited to see this movie when it originally came out, but recently rented it and found that it was surprisingly good.  It takes a played-out story and gives it fresh twist and even goes one step further than usual and solves the crime!  AND the solution makes sense!
Johnny Depp, using an authentic Cockney accent, does a great job in the lead as a demoralized inspector seeking the truth about these gruesome sex crimes.   Heather Graham finally gives up her kittenish image and also comes through in her role as one of the ""unfortunates"" or prostitutes of the London streets.The dark, moody atmosphere is created through camerawork, sets and the editing, which has a dreamy, surrealistic edge to it inspired by Depp's opium hazes and ""intuitions"".  Though these visions are not crucial to the plot, they take us a little more into the horror of what these crimes were.If you are squeamish about blood, DO NOT see this movie, because these filmmakers want you to experience these acts even from the point of view of ""The Ripper"", but if you are a fan of the horror genre, I would say that ""From Hell"" is a must-see.",From Hell
186,auberus,"A beautiful picture, a powerful plot, a disappointing film",5,26 October 2001,"""From Hell"" is another Jack the ripper movie. It is the 4th movie of the Hughes brothers (after Menace II Society in 93, Dead President in 95 and American Pimp in 99). It is also the most accomplished one from a technical stand point. Finally it is a fairly good adaptation of the novel by Alan Moore. The movie match the pace, the atmosphere and the style of the novel. The only good difference is that in the movie, you follow the investigation through inspector Frederick George Abberline's eyes (Johnny Depp), meaning you don't know who Jack the ripper is until the last 10 minutes of the movie. The picture of ""From Hell"" is very well set. The lightning and the shadows of London streets (even though it was filmed in Prague) are a piece of work. The realization is almost perfect: from the authenticity of this White Chapel district down to the very detail of the costumes, the work achieved here is truly impressive. The overall atmosphere is tainted with Gothic effects which ad to the power of some scenes. The sound of the movie is also very well worked, from the carriages wheels to the sound of the footstep over London's pavement. However the movie remain disappointing. The acting and the dynamic of the characters are superficially done. If Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow, 1999)was pretty descent and Ian Holm (remember him as Ash in Alien 1979 or in the Chariots of Fire in 1981) gave (almost as usual) a great performance, Heather Graham (Austin Powers, 1999) never emerged from the plot. She should have become the obsession of both Jack the ripper and inspector Abberline. Unfortunately most of this dynamic is underplayed. As a result the movie suffers from a lack of suspense (you just never get scared). There is almost no tension and little by little the movie becomes a pure artistic exercise leaving the cinematographic experience being a minor objectives (it should be the other way around!!!). The Hughes brothers managed to make a beautiful movie, unfortunately they also manage to make a scary movie non-scary and a powerful story unpowerful. I guess it is just another Jack the ripper movie, not the best one.",From Hell
187,homer_simpson91,One of the biggest disappointments of the year,5,20 October 2001,"This movie joins ALONG CAME A SPIDER (5/10) and DON'T SAY A WORD (4/10) in the category of movies this year that looked great in the previews and that I was really looking forward too, and then turned out to suck. What a horrible disappointment this movie was to me.First, the good points. Johnny Depp is an incredible actor and he gives an excellent performance in this movie. Also, the death scenes were well done, and the gore gave me the ""ewwwww.......cool"" reaction I was hoping for. Good costumes and scenery.But those are the only good points as far as I'm concerned. This is probably Heather Graham at her worst, and the chemistry between she and Johnny Depp was poor. Not that it matters, because the romance between the two was barely developed. The ""bad guys"" confused me, and yet I was able to predict who Jack the Ripper HIMSELF was right from the very beginning of the movie. The ending was also very predictable.Worst of all, I found myself bored with the whole thing near the end. (Around the time when Jack the Ripper's identity is revealed. But, again, I had predicted who he was much earlier in the movie.) I was just waiting for it to end.And why were the ""visions"" even in this movie? They weren't used very often anyway, and if they were eliminated completely from the movie it would have been at least as good or better.To me, this movie looked like a darker, better, and more gory version of SLEEPY HOLLOW (8/10).

188,evilasahobby,Stylistic and empty,5,25 February 2002,"Let me start off by saying _From Hell_ is not a bad film. It is stylistically very striking, and the Hughes Brothers have done a great job in getting London dirty in recreating Victorian times. The atmosphere, the characters (with the exception of the luminous Heather Graham, the cleanest whore in all of London!) are all consistent with a dank, dirty city. The murders are well shot, all the actors are hit their marks, and the film doesn't sensationalise the violence to a great extent.But... having read the graphic novel the movie is based on, I was disappointed. Alan Moore's tale sought to humanize a group of people preyed upon by the Ripper while bringing some motivation to the Ripper murders. The murderer is known from the outset, and it is the character interplay and the metaphysics of the story that provide the fiction's flavour.The Hughes Brothers have instead chose to make a whodunnit of the tale, and have cut out a lot of the story away. I could see the trails of the original narrative trailing throughout the movie, but that only left me disappointed when I saw other bits left out. Mr Moore's narrative would I have been very difficult to film, and would have lasted for hours. Even so, I felt more could have been done. In chaptering the style of _From Hell_, I feel the Hughes Brothers have left out the heart.And I feel for those confused by the end of the movie. It makes some sense in the graphic novel, but really seems dropped out of nowhere in the film.Overall, not a bad film, but it was unable to live up to the source material.",From Hell
189,Alex-Tsander,"Entertaining rubbish, in itself like a Victorian penny dreadful.",5,26 June 2005,"This piece is immensely silly but quite entertaining, often in spite of itself, on account of being unintentionally hilarious from the start.I watched it on TV and the jump from the presenter's dire warning of ""Contains strong language from the very start"" to the stereotype Cockney's declaring ""bloody"" this and ""bleedin"" that was hysterical! The depiction of Whitechapel low-life reminded me of my all time favourite Jack The Ripper movie, made as part of a ""Mad"" compendium, in which the murderer is exposed as being none other than...the Loch Ness Monster! Some years ago, before the film was finished, I interviewed and photographed at a comic convention the publisher of the original graphic novel. He was adamant that this was going to be definitively the true story of Jack The Ripper! No fantasy licence about it! Seen in the context of his earnest claims the end product seems every bit as daft as the conjecture that it was Nessie wot did it. For although the story is woven in and around some of the facts of the case, it is really a complete flight of fantasy. And utterly fantastical at that.For a start, even in modern Britain, anyone not ""well spoken"", let alone someone who yardles on like Depp does here could never rise to the rank of inspector in the Metropolitan Police. Let alone in the Nineteenth Century. The unreality of his ""Mockney"" speakin' jack-the-lad druggie cop is fundamentally not of this world. The same is true of the idea that people of the period commonly sat at home listening to gramophone recording's as do a couple of the characters here. The disc gramophone had only been invented the year before! More unreal even than that is that in one scene the gramophone is playing music from the score of the movie! And what, in the end, if anything, did John Merrick have to do with all this? Were we were supposed to think, yep, it's the Elephant Man wot did it ).These matters aside, Ian Holm turns in a superbly entertaining performance that knocks the tired Hollywood slasher-stereotype into a cocked hat. Although one cannot help in passing momentarily seeing him as a kind of psycho-Bilbo. However, unlike the tedious likes of Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees, Holm's monster is genuinely chilling, because he is totally believable. The scenes in which we are shown his tenuous grasp on reality, the paranoiac visions and time-slips unravelling in his head, are definitely the best thing here. Although the black contact lenses are another detail hard to reconcile with reality. Even more so the weird gloaming from the windows which the cabman spies, suggesting that Jack's murdering plan in objectively does release an awesome ethereal power! It's as though the two directors could not agree as to whether it should be ""all in the mind"" or a real force of black magic.The same dichotomy is found in the closing scenes. However,the depiction of Kelly's happy ending with the often mentioned but not previously seen ""Baby Alice"" is possessed of an idealised unreality that strikes an effective note of ambiguity. Does it work out well or is it only in the drug-addled mind of the wishful dreamer on his deathbed.",From Hell

191,kmberger,A psychotropic thriller,9,9 January 2002,"There are many things in media that have nearly insurmountable preconceptions that lead to generic truisms. One of these is 'comic books are pure fluff,' and another is 'no good movie is ever based on a comic book'. From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window.  Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man's carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888.   This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore's story into the crime tale.  Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light.  The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was.  All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey.  Ian Holm, Heather Graham, and Ian Richardson also provide good supporting roles. 
For an historical perspective of the Jack the Ripper crimes, best to watch an A&E documentary.  But for a theoretical description of the crimes, and an artful depiction of a carefully constructed tale, definitely check out the very chilling, very calculated, and very good From Hell.",From Hell
192,LG72387,Visually Stunning,6,27 May 2002,"From Hell is a gruesome portrait of murder in London during the reign of Queen Victoria. It tells the story of Jack the Ripper, a psychotic individual who murdered 5 prostitutes. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the inspector who tries to hunt him down and delivers one of the best performances of his career. The story is well written by the Hughes Brothers and is a truly enjoyable film for anyone who loves the horror genre. However, it is the predictability of this film and the performance of Heather Graham which provides From Hell with a downfall. The spoken dialogue between Depp and a good doctor lets you easily figure out who the murderer is. It does not supply the audience with a surprise or twist. Heather Graham's performance is purely simple and does not illustrate her capable talent. She does not deliver a well-rounded performance as Mary Kelly (also a prostitute) because she does not show essential emotion (i.e. fear) in order to fulfill her role. However, the film is an exceptional horror picture and should not be overlooked by any fan of movies.",From Hell
193,Lucky-63,From Absinthe-Are-Us,5,10 October 2003,"""From Hell"" proves that no matter how much money you throw at a crappy script and amateur direction, you don't get a good movie.See, it isn't just enough to pick one of the most sensationally gory police blotter stories of the past century, throw buckets of money at costumers & set folks, and pick two or three good actors. You have to motivate them to act with good writing. Or *something*.The story is such old hat that it needed a really good angle. Implicating the royal family isn't new. The Whitechapel wannabes wandering the very well-scrubbed sets are all well-scrubbed and their clothing is meticulously clean. AS IF! Late 19th century London was DIRTY, PEOPLE! How is it all of these whores, too poor to have a place to live, are running around in NEW clothes that look like they just got out of the dry cleaners? (Read that last line like Sam Kinnison would have, screaming ""just got out..."")There are a few shots of squeamish gore. After all, that's what we paid to see, right? ICHOR! ICHOR! But the reactions of the police actors and public onlookers? I'd expect better reactions from actors in a high school play. They look more like they stepped in dogcrap. (Hmmm.)Inspector Depp spends much of his screen-time doing free advertising for absinthe. What, he's sorry he didn't do ""Total Eclipse""?
Robbie Coltrane's character (amiable Coltrane has the only lively part in the movie) can't decide if the inspector is his buddy (""Goodnight sweet prince"", he says at the end of the movie ... ECCCH! Shakespeare!) or his boss (when Depp snaps an order at him, he gets all ... *obedient*).I know, I know, this whole movie is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek.

195,pc_dean,Saucy Jacky's Bloody Good Time,9,31 October 2001,"""From Hell"" is not really a horror movie, though it has some gruesome and disturbing moments, but rather a modern serial-killer movie given an unusual setting, delving into our fascination with the first truly famous serial killer in history.One of the nice things about making a Jack the Ripper movie is that it is a historical story, which lends it a certain gravitas and a built-in interest factor, but since history doesn't know for sure who the guy really was, you get to make up your own ending.  ""From Hell"" seizes on one of the more far-out (and frankly, historically implausible) conspiracy theories surrounding the mysterious stalker of Whitechapel.  Still, in Ripper lore there is plenty of ""evidence"" that can be construed to support just about any theory you can think of, and while the movie takes a few liberties with the historical record, a great many details are rooted in established fact. While I wouldn't view this movie as a conclusive examination of the case, it gives the story enough credibility that it functions quite well as a thriller.The story follows Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp), the detective charged with catching the killer (oddly, they consistently refer to him as ""Jack the Ripper"", even while the movie acknowledges that the letter bearing that name was probably a fake), while he navigates the seamy alleys of the East End, trying to protect the streetwalkers that seem to attract homicidal wrath (among them Heather Graham, as ""Black Mary"" Kelly; interesting casting choice, that) and contending with the interference of Scotland Yard's shadowy and muscular Special Branch.One irritating thing about the movie is in the character of Abberline. Understandably, the movie makes him younger and sleeker so he can be played by Johnny Depp (the real-life Abberline was forty-five and married with children while investigating the Ripper case), but it also subscribes to the annoying convention of mythologizing the ""profiler"".  I swear if I see one more psychic detective who gets otherworldly ""vibes"" about a case, I'm going to hurl my copy of ""Journey into Darkness"" through the screen.  Hollywood seems uncomfortable dealing with profilers for what they are: experienced detectives who are able to detect patterns in a crime and extrapolate what kind of person they are looking for.  Isn't that impressive enough? Abberline was, by most accounts, a dedicated and methodical investigator, but here he is a slightly dissolute dope fiend who gets flashes of the future and ""sees"" the Ripper's future victims while in an absinthe or opium-induced daze.  Often, the ""psychic detective"" thing is used as a cheap springboard for a lazy screenwriter to avoid having to think about how the pieces of a puzzle might fit together; in this movie the ""visions"" are not only distracting, they're really unnecessary: they reveal little that a sharp guy like Abberline couldn't figure out from available evidence.  They must have been interesting to film, though; I guess that's why they're in the movie.Twin directors Albert and Allen Hughes made their mark in the 90s with the acclaimed ""Menace II Society"", one of the raft of inner-city neo-gangster opuses that were in vogue at the time.  It seems the Hugheses made a deliberate attempt to make a movie as different from that as they could, and it would seem a shrewd move.  After all, it took John Singleton a couple of movies to escape from the 'hood; and, remember what happened to Matty Rich? Yeah, me neither.  Though ""From Hell"" is a story of another blighted urban landscape, there's not a drive-by in sight.  Well, maybe by hansom cab.The Hugheses make good use of the fetid, dire streets of 1880s London (actually, the movie was filmed primarily in the Czech Republic; apparently, London just ain't seedy enough anymore).  They play with light in interesting ways, silhouetting the spires of London's palaces and cathedrals against a roiling red sky, suggesting that if we aren't actually in Hell, we're at least in a pretty close suburb with bus service there.  The Ripper's hansom cab has twin lanterns that sputter with bilious green light; it looks like a primordial monster slithering through the night, which is a neat visual (useful, too; hansom cabs all look pretty much alike otherwise).The cast is good, although more so in supporting roles than lead ones.  Depp is fine, though his accent is weird.  Heather Graham is better than I expected her to be, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn't have been too hard to find a better actress (probably for less money).  Ian Holm does well as a retired surgeon who advises Abberline on the investigation, an old man with an infirm arm and a few too many secrets to keep.  Also standing out is Robbie Coltrane, as Abberline's loyal, over-literate sergeant.  Fans of ""The Elephant Man"" will take special interest in a certain historical cameo.The movie is well-paced, well-filmed, and delivers the thriller goods in fine style.  It doesn't hold up to too much scrutiny, especially among those familiar with the real case, unless they're willing to be good sports. There are a few spots where, eager to fit in as many authentic details as possible, the characters do things that don't make much sense, and the exact motivations for some of the Ripper's actions are not made clear.  I suppose you shouldn't expect too much clarity form a movie about an unsolved case. Ripperologists and aspiring forensic historians should not so much suspend their disbelief as zip it in a bag and leave it at the box office for a claim stub; you can pick it up when you leave.",From Hell
196,henfish,As Illuminating As The Victorian Gas Lamp,5,2 July 2002,"Inspector Fred Abberline (Depp) is thrust into the middle of his (nee' England's) most serious crime wave: Jack The Ripper.  He's a capable officer with a loyal assistant (Coltrane) but it's going to take more than guess work and intuition to crack this evil-nut.  Fortunately, Abberline is also gifted with special sight.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help prevent the murders.  Unbelievably, he falls in love with the prostitute at the head of the group seemingly on the Ripper's slash list:  Mary Kelly (Graham).  Can he prevent her demise?!  Are the Royal Family REALLY involved?!  Are the Juwes the ones who will not be blamed for nothing?!If you know nothing about the life and times of history's most celebrated serial killer then you will probably appreciate this well made, atmospheric thriller for the brooding fantasy feature it is.  Unfortunately, the more you know about the period of the Ripper, the less - proportionally - you will like about this film.  For starters, the theory at the heart of the plot has almost universally been either discretited or, at the very least, presented as unrectifiably flawed.  Secondly, Abberline's penchant for narcotics is (and always has been) highly debatable.  A difficult point to reconcile oneself with when it forms a rock-solid tenet of the movie's story.  And then there's the prostitutes:  Graham as Mary Kelly suffers from being at least a league prettier than the next whore (until Estelle Skornik's belated appearance), a red-head (when in reality blonde) and being burdened with a hybrid London/English accent bearing no element of her native Irish or her adopted Welsh (she lived in Cardiff until her early twenties)?  Likewise, 'Long' Liz Stride displays not a jot of her native Swedish accent despite only locating to England well into her mid twenties.
There are several other flaws which will niggle away at most viewers who possess even a slight knowledge of the murders.  But, so what?  It's a film. A piece of cinema.  It's not supposed to be true.  It's quite well made and (for the most part) reigns in it's cliches.  Depp invests a certain acting integrity and is supported, ably, by a stong British cast allowed to spout reasonably believable dialogue.  But it's not any greater than that.  And it DOES purport to be true.  All the characters existed and virtually all of them did what they did in the film.  So picking up on easily rectifiable flaws IS valid.  There are few things worse than lazy film making and - despite some tangible plus points - there is a veneer of sloppiness here which is sometimes difficult to see beyond.",From Hell
197,seltzer,Stylish and suspenseful,10,25 May 2002,"I loved it.  I thought it was a great mix of Victorian era whodunnit, horror, and a little bit of the paranormal.  The time and place are presented more convincingly than many other films set in the same era.  The mystery is well-plotted and paced, and matches the real life events with a more than plausible explanation for their occurrence.  There is a paranormal aspect to this interpretation, but it does not detract from the plot or stray off needlessly into either laborious exposition or lala-land new agey stoner mysticism.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole film, and the payoff was worth it.  Highly recommended!",From Hell
198,Caribstu,A ripping yarn? Or a schizophrenic tale?,7,3 April 2010,"What do you get if you mix Edward Elgar, Take That and Ministry of Sound at Ibiza? You get ""From Hell"". This film is a mix of historical fact ( Elgar), urban legend ( Take That) and surreal drama ( MOS Ibiza) coming together to form a strange yet enjoyable dance.The film is set in Victorian London when the poorer classes of London's Whitechapel area lived in fear of the most infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper. Directed by the Hughes Brothers, much is made of Inspector Abeline's opium, Absynth and strychnine addiction, something associated more with Sherlock Holmes than Abeline although historically accurate as the drugs of choice for the Victorian gent in London .Johnny Depp, an actor who seems to pick roles which allow him to showcase his versatility is convincing as Abeline, the unfortunate detective who became a sacrificial scapegoat offered up to the frustrated and furious Londoners by a powerful Masonic order. His London accent varies through the film and is reminiscent of his Jack Sparrow. Choosing to understate the role and not to go over the top with the drug scenes or action, but play it in the calm controlled way expected of a Victorian gent. It's tempting to compare Depp's Inspector Abeline with Robert Downey Jr's Holmes but one should remember Holmes was fictional allowing RDJ to go over the top, where as Abeline is real and Depp plays it more so.The tale of Jack the Ripper is well known, this version however explores a particular belief that Jack had royal connections and was protected by the Masonic order. The film is filled with factual aspects such as the pressure put upon Abeline to find a Jew butcher as the murderer, the chalk writing being washed off the wall and the intentional misspelling of Juwes. Equally it's full of assumptions, however I couldn't help feeling it's the closest any film has come to the truth. No one has ever sufficiently answered how Jack the Ripper was able to get in and out of east London unseen and un stopped, and the murders, swift and brutal over a short period seemed to end as quickly as they had begun without reason or answer.The plot is simple to follow and unfolds with ease as the film progresses, there are no surprises or ridiculous unbelievable twists but there are some problems with the film. You're repeatedly bombarded with surreal drug influenced moments, expected to believe in a miss fitting romance subplot, asked not to question set and costume design which is accurately Victorian but seems too clean and bright for the age. Perhaps the directors felt Abeline's drug induced visions were important and purposely avoided the classic Victorian smog and squalor we think of to give a bright and fresh feel . Additionally, less is made of Jack the Ripper's acts themselves. Given that the film is titled ""From Hell"" which is how the genuine Ripper letters were addressed, surprisingly the letters and body parts he sent to the newspapers and Scotland Yard is hardly touched upon as the film seems to concern itself more with Abeline and the Masons rather than Jack and his actions. We shouldn't forget how disturbed the mind of Jack the Ripper was and perhaps the fact that somehow these events were indeed covered up, even to this day, the directors were perhaps right to focus on those who sought to perpetrate the cover up than remake a story told so many times before. That said all these things do leave you feeling that the film is not sure of it's own identity and is somewhat confused, schizophrenic even. Enjoyable none the less.7/10",From Hell

202,Dr. Nick*#3,Okay,7,20 June 2002,"Gothic trappings and dreamy visuals try desperately to cover the stench of exploitation in this violent, speculative retelling of the Jack the Ripper incidents. Johnny Depp, who plays the clairvoyant detective on the trail of the murderer, is a wonderfully intuitive actor but has always lacked a certain screen presence/charisma, an attribute that works in his favor in films like Dead Man or Nick of Time but detracts from performances in, say, Blow from last year, films where we need to believe he has the magnetism and deep motivations the script is telling us he has. His ethereality, for lack of a better word, is a mixed bag here, as the murders and intrigue behind the killer's identity far overshadow and out-interest whatever internal conflicts the Depp character carries. On the plus side, the love story, between him and a potentially doomed prostitute(Heather Graham) makes sense and adds needed poignancy to balance out the carnage the directors(Hughes Brothers) are so eager to wallow in. The murders are inventively, brutally shot, and as the camera lingers unsympathetically on the grisly aftermaths the connection is eloquently, methodically made between the polite economic violence of the London elite and the cold brutality of being on the bottom rung. Nifty piece of work there. The fact that the Hughes are good at what they do(exploitation) doesn't get them a pass but it does lead them into some interesting territory almost in spite of themselves. 8/10",From Hell
203,boo_4ever,Real life Ripped off,6,31 March 2005,From Hell takes a genuine theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper and dramatises it. We follow opium addicted inspector Abberline played by Johnny Depp as he tried to discover exactly who is stalking Londons East End. It had better not be Phil Mitchell again.The film is stylishly shot and really brings grimy victorian London to life. The story is interesting and well known. However the film is just far too long. I felt it would be far better and more gripping had it been a good half an hour shorter. It was littered with useless scenes which dragged on leaving you bored as much as you tried to get into the story. It was like the director just couldn't make up his mind what to cut and said to hell with it.The character of Jack the Ripper needing a carriage driver to get around London (with no one noticing a huge black carriage at every murder scene) reduced the impact of the character. He just didn't feel as evil or as vile when you knew without his lackey he'd be waiting for the bus like the rest of us.Just a few niggles like this prevents me from giving it my highest scores.

Also, she has exposed the warfare between the Monarchists/Masons and everybody else who wanted change.If she hadn't already exposed the class discrimination that led decent women to have no choice to stay alive but to prostitute themselves and their horrific treatment in general let alone at the hands of the Ripper, I might also have found this shocking.But the addition of Johnny Depp's psychic detective was wasted which is way too bad because he is generally better than this. Robbie Coltrane was wasted too and the substitution of Shakespearian quotes for his dialogue just got annoying after awhile.This confused retelling of the theory that one of the Royal Sons of Queen Victoria was the ripper or the cover up blah blah mixed with the supposed secret Catholic marriage (which I was under the impression was the rumour about George IV when he was still the Prince of Wales and Maria Fitzherbert during the Regency period) doesn't make any sense.To make matters weirder they say that the Prince used the name Albert Sickert and the disguise of being a painter which is a nod to the alternate major ripper theory that the ripper was Walter Sickert, an established painter and amateur thespian with a mutilated penis from a childhood botched surgery and a major grudge against women who represented sexuality (hookers) because he couldn't actually have sex.Heather Graham did a better job with the accent than I thought she would although when she went home to Ireland you would think she would let her Irish accent come out rather than stick to cockney.This movie might be considered a needed dose of historically accurate social class prejudice revelation for those who didn't already know (which includes most Americans) but if I want me some real Depp action I will just watch Johnny in the brilliant ""Ninth Gate"" again.",From Hell

What we have here, is the victory of style over content. Sometimes when a film is supposedly about a real person, I think it best to forget that, or at least try to enjoy the film for it's own sake. Some things are taken for granted. No-one knows who killed the girls, so how do we know the same person killed them all? The thing that comes across most strongly when reading about the murders, is the incompetence of the police. Was a huge 'cover up' in operation? Again, no-one knows. For me, the film would have benefited from better editing, more character development,and less of them. I would still like to see more from the Hughes, at least the film was a brave attempt at something different.",From Hell

Yet, unarguably he is phenomenally talented, and it cannot be denied, especially by a US peasant such as myself.So with that being said, this is a flick that is exceptional in it's scope and is relentless in the free exploration of possibilities of the times.Controvery, is the least this story, would have been greeted with, had it come out during it's times.

208,Evolvist,"Hannibal Lecter, Eat Your Heart Out (a bad pun, but I could not resist).",8,17 June 2002,"Well, the Hughes Bros. really have their stuff together in their latest movie, From Hell.  When I originally saw the movie at the theaters I gave it a `7'; but not that I have scoped it out on DVD I believe an `8' is more in order for what is surely the new definitive Jack The Ripper movie.  The directors (and writers, for that matter) took the least plausible `Ripper Theory' and turned into to something that is very much believable.  For what it is worth, as a child, I read up quite a bit on the Whitechapel murders, and although I espouse I different belief in what happened in London in 1888; nevertheless, From Hell, took enough turns to make me second-guess my theory. The imagery in From Hell was top-notch all the way, and while Heather Graham's Irish accent was abysmal (as well as about half of her acting), Johnny Depp was aces, as always.      If you ever get a chance to check out the deleted scenes on the DVD release, you will notice that the Hughes Brothers intended the movie to be a bit more seedier then what we saw in the theatrical release.  From Hell was pretty dark as it is, nonetheless, I wish they had kept some of the more grittier scenes and thus showed more of the underbelly of 19th Century England.  The deleted scenes are fun to watch.  For the most part, however, the Hughes Brothers did not pull any punches, and what we see in From Hell really is a parallel to our present day sub-cultures of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, thievery, and basic skullduggery. The Hughes Brothers did their research into the Jack the Ripper mystique more than any other filmmakers to date (and I have seen them all the Ripper movies).  Down to the last cobblestone of Mitre Street, and the paint on the buildings-even the way each victim was mutilated, and how they lay in the street-taking every jot and tittle from the original police and forensics reports, this movie makes the grade. I really can't say why I did not give it a higher rating.  Something was missing from the flick, but I don't know what.  Nevertheless, if you want a good, solid movie, with lots of fiends and villains, history and mystery, you can't go wrong with From Hell.",From Hell
209,bonnie91,A beautiful piece of cinematographic work,9,26 April 2006,"From Hell is meticulously produced and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a horror movie.Although the story about who Jack the Ripper is is a little contrived at times, in general the plot is interesting. All the actors involved are excellent and the movie has the grisly moments you'd expect, considering the subject-matter. It keeps you interested and involved for the whole two hours, not to mention it looks beautiful.Heather Graham and gang as prostitutes put in a great and touching performance, showing the human side of the women that are unfortunate enough to have been in this profession in the Victorian era, and Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual, although (as others have pointed out) his English accent may be a little off, which I wouldn't know about since I'm American.This film is great entertainment and I would highly recommend buying the DVD (if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway, it's that good).

210,Gareth_Hacking,A poor adaption of great source material,4,9 September 2002,"I watched From Hell as a preview at my local cinema a while back. I thought it was an above average thriller that had a few problems in the story and casting areas (Heather Graham as an Irish prostitute somehow just doesn't convince me, maybe because she didn't have a spec of dirt on her or a decent accent). Afterwards I got around to reading the Alan Moore + Eddie Campbell brilliant graphic novel and realised that as an adaptation of that story, this film is really awful. Just because comics are words and pictures, doesn't mean they're all going to work as movies. I hope that Don Murphy, the guy behind this effort, can make a better job of the forthcoming 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.",From Hell

PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE FILMFROM HELL was better than say SLEEPY HOLLOW, but that isn't saying much. Like that other film, this was all style and no substance. What is the point of having a pretty picture when it means absolutely nothing to the viewer? This oft-told tale needs something fresh to get a jaded, *UH-HUM*, experienced viewer, such as myself interested. The Hughes brothers went to obsessive-compulsive lengths to get the historical details of the murders right and to create a unique Gothic sense of 19th century London, but they did so at the cost of involving the audience with an actual story. I don't mind the fictitious elements, in fact, I welcome them, because despite what is known about the Ripper murders, a lot remains a mystery. But what I cannot stand is the conspicuousness of someone like Heather Graham in this kind of film, much like Milla Jovovich in THE MESSENGER. I simply could not get over the incongruities of Graham's perfect white teeth and statuesque body with the absolute wretched squalor of her environs and prostitute friends. My other technical quibbles have to do with the directors themselves. Specifically, I'll certainly be glad when the Hughes brothers mature, because right now (through either naiveté or insecurity), they feel the need to use every camera shot they ever learned in film school to show how clever they are. All of that gets old very quickly.
As for the story itself, like I said, nothing new or interesting is presented in FROM HELL. The choice of the Ripper is anybody's guess and frankly does not matter. (Although, I have to admit that making the Ripper a Mason was certainly fresh and different.) The relationship between the Inspector (Johnny Depp) and Graham is surprisingly rushed, cliché, and truncated. And finally, this film just isn't gory or scary. Maybe that one's just a horrible reflection upon me or the times in which we live, but MTV-like flashes of blood and horror do not register well with me.In all, I found FROM HELL to be well-made but nothing more than that. It was certainly worth the $4.50 I paid but I strongly recommend not paying more than that.

213,mcquestion,"From Hell not a documentary, and also not a bad movie",8,30 March 2002,"For those who moan and whine that the movie does not follow the ACTUAL trail of events that Jack The Ripper left behind for us to follow, nobody ever said this was a documentary, and boy it sure isn't. Remember, this is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL (i.e. A COMIC), not history. That being said, it's not a bad film at all. Johnny Depp is pretty darn good, Ian Holm and the guy from the Brit series Cracker are excellent, the recreation of Vicotiran England is without peer, and the story is passable (though an exact recreation of the Sherlock Holmes Vs. Jack The Ripper movie called ""Murder By Decree"" starring Christopher Plumber as Holmes. I swear if you ever see it it's the EXACT same story). Graham is indeed miscast here and stands out garishly compared to her fellow prostitutes who actually look the part while she just looks like Felcity Shagwell on a bad hair day. All in all, if you're not expecting much more than to be entertained, I thought it was pretty good and recommend it. I'm even going to buy it on DVD because of it's excellent recreation of Victorian England. MAJOR WARNING!! THIS IS A GRAPHIC FILM AND IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!",From Hell
214,mcquestion,This is NOT a documentary...,8,27 May 2002,"WARNING - MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI must say I completely enjoyed this film from beginning to end. It is the only film the Hughes Brothers have made that I enjoyed. I have never enjoyed ""slasher"" films or anything in that genre, but From Hell I enjoyed so much I bought it on DVD. People have complained that this film doesn't follow the facts of history and so on. I rush to the film's defense, reminding everyone that this movie is not, nor has it ever claimed to be, a documentary. This is a Hollywood adaptation of a graphic novel, basically a long and more adult-oriented comic book. There has never been a more realistic and stylish representation of Victorian London and the ghetto that is Whitechapel. But style alone does not a great movie make. Johnny Depp is outstanding in this film, as is Robbie Coltrane who is good in everything it seems. Ian Holm is a great Jack the Ripper, not at all overacted and his smaller stature seems to add something to his performance as a believable psychotic. The only problem I have with the whole film is Heather Graham, who plays the part reasonably well, but she's so much better looking than her fellow prostitutes that she sticks out like a massive sore thumb. There isn't as much graphic violence in this as I thought there would be. In fact, you don't see too much gore until the final two murders, which are admittedly brutal. You do HEAR the killings, but for the most part you don't see them. I am NOT a fan of gore so if I say this film wasn't too disturbing than probably you won't either, though this is by no means a film to be watched in the presence of children. If you would prefer a film that sticks to facts, don't see From Hell, but if you like a stylish thriller with some rather disturbing moments and a whodunnit, this is a great film",From Hell
215,KenLiversausage,Simply a fantastic movie,9,1 October 2003,"The critics, nit-pickers and historical pedants who've trashed this superb piece of truly cinematic movie-making have totally missed the point.So what if Johnny Depp's English accent isn't exactly ""right"" for his character? (English accents have always been problematic for all but the most skilled of American actors: Depp pulls it off entirely passably, way way better than - say - Keanu Reeves, risible in Coppola's Dracula. Think of Kevin Costner, who didn't even bother trying in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.) I'm a Londoner by birth, and for me the accent in no way detracted from Depp's excellent performance.As for history, again, who cares if the filmmakers have employed a degree of dramatic licence? This is a movie, not a documentary. Nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was, and in order to make the film interesting and enjoyable the writers have speculated a little. Fine by me.OK, so Heather Graham was impossibly glamorous, but movies with big budgets need a little bit of star appeal. The notion of the ""tart with a heart"" is a cliché, sure, but nevertheless her character works in the context of the film. (Contrast the depiction of prostitution generally in this film with the utter garbage that is Pretty Woman.)What's so great about this film? The quirky, literate script; the performances (all, with the possible exception of Graham, excellent); the wonderful photography and production design; the depiction of the murders themselves - elliptical, shocking, mesmerising; and above all the aura of brooding menace, gloom, cruelty, darkness, melancholy and downright despair running through it as deeply as the veins through a block of marble. This is marvellously thoughtful, evocative film-making, very bold and brave. No happy Hollywood ending, no phoney saccharine or cheap laughs to satisfy the popcorn brigade. This is a proper grown-ups movie that probes some of the darkest regions of the human psyche, places mainstream filmmakers like Lucas, Spielberg, James Cameron and their ilk don't dare to go, or couldn't go even if they wanted to. To me it appeals almost on a subconscious level, forcing us to confront our deepest fears and taboos - death, pain, suffering, human wickedness. I can't think of a recent major release that is so relentlessly downbeat.Don't let the detractors put you off. It's hardly surprising a generation weened on MTV - folk with the the attention span of a gnat and the emotional depth of a paper cup - didn't like it. They've got their Screams and their Scary Movies, and they're welcome to them. This is super stuff, and the Hughes brothers and their collaborators should be heartily congratulated for it.A classic, not so much for the plot, which is a little contrived, but for its sure command of cinema as a visual storytelling medium.",From Hell
216,say_andy,An effective Gothic horror piece of speculative fiction...,7,18 July 2005,"For those who don't know, From Hell is an adaptation of the graphic novel by the same name, written by comics-god Alan Moore and with art by Eddie Campbell. Now, I've never read the graphic novel, so I won't be commenting on how well The Hughes Brothers adapted Moore's work. I will say this though, the movie certainly looks like a graphic novel, with its creepy rendition of late nineteenth century London, and its red painted skies.This graphic novel stuff is important to note because one must realise that From Hell the movie isn't trying to be an accurate depiction of the history of Jack the Ripper, but rather an adaptation of a book that was a heavily-researched, but ultimately speculative fictional account on the story of Jack the Ripper. The movie isn't trying to be historically-accurate, but rather uses history as a context for its fictional narrative. Which doesn't mean that one can't be bothered when police officers carry flashlights or when they screw up a historical figure's actual title given the year of the story (1888), these are anachronisms that should've been correct. However, if someone is upset by the film's suggestions on the identity of Jack the Ripper or the fate of Mary Kelly, then they're missing the point of the fiction. The film isn't trying to be the definitive account of Jack the Ripper, but rather the telling of a theory, a ""what if"" tale as it were.On to the film itself, From Hell is a gruesome telling of the Jack the Ripper story. Due to the nature of the story, it is gruesome and grim, and visually dynamic. I'd describe it as a moderately scary semi-horror movie for people (like myself) who don't watch horror movies. In watching the special features, it appears that the Hughes Brothers did a pretty good job matching scenes to the actual locations of the crimes in question, which makes the film a little more chilling in retrospect.In terms of acting, Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Fred Abberline, the chief investigator in the Ripper killings in White Chapel. He creates a character interesting enough that the audience is compelled to follow throughout the film, but nothing too spectacular. His co-star Heather Graham, playing prostitute and potential-Ripper victim Mary Kelly, is the weak link of the film, with a horrible accent and a useless romance sub-plot. It is obvious that she was cast to help open the film, and the character was fleshed out to humanise the victims. However, she is horribly out of place amongst the otherwise English cast (that being the actors not named Depp and Graham) and does little for the film than look good (which, I don't mind, since she does look good. Perhaps a little too good for a nineteenth century prostitute). Joining Depp and Graham are Ian Holm as the Royal Family's physician-in-ordinary Sir William Gull and Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Peter Godley.I found the flick to be a fairly effective Gothic horror movie, and enjoyed the theoretical explanation of Jack the Ripper's true identity and motives. The film has some genuinely creepy and horrifying moments, chief among them is the carriage the Ripper uses to bring himself to his victims, which is made at the same time ordinary and other-worldly through the use of shadows and sound. It has a very Sleepy Hollow-feel to it, which is always a little creepy.However, the film is merely above average, as it does a few things very well, but nothing extraordinarily well. A good movie to check it if you're in the mood for some late 1800's England creepiness, but aren't expecting high art.",From Hell

We really laughed at some of the bad lines in this film.
We both have been big fans of Johnny Depp.  Recently he seems to have been cruising through most of his films, getting by on his looks and attitude without really acting.  In this film he tried to do that, but it didn't work.  His performance was very very disappointing in this film.  If you want to see him in a much better ""period"" horror film, rent Sleepy Hollow.

I for one didn't guess who the Ripper was, though that probably says more about me than about the screenwriter's skill.  For some reason I just didn't get involved.  Neither couls Depp since he was acting on autopilot here (though a Depp on autopilot is still better then a lot of today's actors in top form).  His romance with graham feels forced, these two are together because the script says so, not because they belonged. On the upside, there was some great looking Art direction and nice music, but that couldn't make up for the fact that From Hell feels empty and soulless, probably much like the Ripper himself.

You can watch the same movie twice, feeling it's a masterpiece on first time, then feeling it's lousy second time, all depending on your state of mind. I can say I watched this movie in my best mental and physical condition and I insist it's a masterpiece. What I hated most was those funny large contact lenses that the killer wears during killing. This is no supernatural horror I guess, so no basis for shape changes.

225,WWalrus,From Hell = Murder By Decree,10,23 October 2001,"""From Hell"" is an excellent Jack the Ripper film, really well produced with good solid acting. For me the most disturbing fact was that the idea of why the Ripper murders happened is extremely close to the film ""Murder By Decree"" in which Sherlock Holmes goes after old Jack. It is a plausible idea and one that could easily be the answer to the whole puzzle.Johnny Depp's Abberline, while using the name of the real detective, is not what the actual Abberline was. In one of the many books devoted to this first serial killer, Abberline is quoted as stating that they did know who the Ripper was but could do nothing because of who he was. This certainly fits the solution in both ""Murder By Decree"" and ""From Hell"".
The producers are to be commended for not turning this into a ""slasher"" film. Yes, there are some disturbing sections, but they are shown quickly and not in graphic detail. The bodies are shown in brief shots that give the idea of the mutilations, but now great detail. The reactions of the coroner, his assistants and the detectives give the idea of how horrible the situation is better than any picture. The bittersweet ending is perfect for the film, but what happens to Abberline is far from the history of the actual man.",From Hell

""From Hell"" is an equally terrific film in terms of camerawork and colors. The 1880 redish skyline of London is as dark, gritty and realistic in this film as any other film I can remember. It is not just the art and set direction which make this production so realistic and interesting; the editing and camera movement is intense and helps glue the viewer's eyes to the screen. Proof of the powerful mise en scene and editing of ""From Hell"" are in the murder sequences.

And the story works, and the fictional (?) explanation of Jack's killings is convincing and somehow amusing.

229,sepial,Poor Mary Kelly,3,15 June 2011,"This movie, loosely based on the graphic novel of the same name, does not offer an accurate account of the events in Whitechapel, autumn 1888, and it doesn't pretend that it does, so folks preoccupied with the Ripper-case don't have to rush and fill the goof-section with corrections regarding the actual ongoings. It also doesn't rely much on the graphic novel, with the exception of the choice for the perpetrator and all this would imply, although different from the novel keeps it a who-dunnit till the end. The movie is a Hollywood action-horror-romance populated with historical figures who underwent even more liberty, ranging from shallow drafting over purpose-posing to audacious character-alteration. In this sense, recreating parts of Whitechapel in Prague, and this still way too clean, was with all the inaccuracy probably not necessary. But OK, it's a show, and the real background story remains captivating enough, as well as Depp's acquired accent and Coltrane's presence.Too many things strangle the effort, however, starting with the main weakness of Heather Graham being cast and outfitted as Mary Kelly. While the other victims, struggling prostitutes in the most ragged quarters of London, were all made up to more or less look that way, torn clothes, unmade hair, bad teeth and no make-up, not to mention the required acting, Graham's Mary Kelly sticks out the way Cinderella would if arriving in Whitechapel after the ball: hair perfect, careful make-up, tidy, clean, unharmed dresses, and Miss Graham is ready for the cast- party. Needless to say, we never see her getting drunk or even just attempting to go after her trade like the others. But then she's the love-interest, of course. Which is another very ill-advised idea, and we see virtually all cliché Hollywood-rules unfolding, a killer when it comes to this particular crime-case.The movie superficially shines with a cast of very able actors, Depp, Richardson, Holm, Coltrane, the late wonderful Katrin Cartlidge, to name a few, and yet, although the fantasy- and horror-genre ever so often tickles surprising performances out of well known stars, nothing breathtaking happens here, with the exception of Holm's play (although watch, he's doing the chin-thing again), too deep the tracks of expectation in character-behaviour are, and too dominant.Fusing an inspector and a self acclaimed medium, who both had been involved, to a clairvoyant inspector might have, with some tolerance, given this re-telling of the story some spice, but the idea went out in a puff in the end. The choice to stick to the graphic novel's conspiracy-take and involvement of the Freemasonry, which Moore himself, with good reason, didn't insist on being the most promising one, decides a course, of course, one that had already been taken once with 'Murder By Decree', and by taking it a lot of rather interesting theories, indicators and characters have to go out the window, but here we go.'From Hell' is pure entertainment, shallow, spotless, with a camera-work good for the eye, lines that fit together and no claim for authenticity. It kept me watching, mainly for the never ceasing fascination with the Whitechapel-murders, leaning back for the ride. It's not a very good movie, though. I'd give it a well-meaning 4, but the Graham-Kelly, so present throughout and in favour over a chance for an interesting Mary Kelly, spoils it. Hence a 3.And: will there ever be a truly engaging, good movie about the subject?",From Hell
230,saska-3,pretty and boring,4,2 August 2003,"This misguided attempt to bring a beautiful graphic novel to the screen hopes that viewers will be so blown away by its visual richness, they will forgive its weak execution of story.  Not to be confused with plot - which, from the graphic novel, is unique and intriguing - story is the execution of the plot, and in this film it fails miserably.Perhaps the Hughes Brothers felt they had to write down to a level below their own intellect, or feared their film would be disliked if the average moviegoer didn't understand what was going on before the characters reached the same conclusions. But this dumbing down amounts to a film with no character-centered surprises, and a surprise based on what feels like a red herring plot twist leaves me very cold indeed.Within the first twenty minutes I had deduced the identity of the man Fred Abberline was hunting, and I literally spent the next two hours waiting to be proven wrong.  My disappointment at finding that the big surprise was not who, but rather why, knew no bounds.  If this is the device by which to save an already-solved murder mystery, it must resonate as a shock and a means to empathize with the murderer.  It is the fault of the screenriters' and directors' execution that this ending, which is so shocking and powerful in the graphic novel, falls flat and feels unfinished here.Johnny Depp's layered portrayals can save nearly any film from the wasteland of 5-and-below ratings, but here he is powerless to resurrect the story.  He is not given enough to do, though what he does, he does well. Unfortunately, the filmmakers set him up as a fool, which the character clearly is not, and this takes the legs out from under Depp's redeeming power.Spoilers follow:By limiting the history, background, and purpose of the Freemasons to a couple of pretty but empty scenes, the viewer is robbed of any investment in the institution as a character in its own right.  Moore's twist on Jack the Ripper as a politically motivated murderer, rather than the first modern serial killer, is a truly unique perspective deserving of a read.  But the graphic novel, though you may know the ending of the film, will still surprise you, and I recommend it as an antidote to any disappointment you experienced here.  4/10",From Hell
231,rudimir-bombardinovic,"Very different, very good, very atmospheric",8,26 January 2009,"There are many horror-mysteries which take their inspiration from historic events that are memorized as one of the most horrifying deeds man has ever done. Most of those films are so occupied with the perpetrator that everything else regarding films becomes less important and so does the film in its entirety. That is not case with this movie.The Hughes brothers made very impressive film, faithfully creating 19th century London and well build up characters and atmosphere from graphic novel. What I liked in particularly was depth that was achieved in explaining (or said better examination) motivation behind murders - madness and motivation of murderer are done in very impressive way almost trying to get inside his head. Portrait of low and high class London was presented is not less impressive way. Everything was spiced with little bit art approach that fits perfectly - European influence worked very well in this movie.Acting is on high level, starting from Johnny Depp who, as usual, gives unique touch to his character to Robbie Coltrane and Ian Holm, all giving good performances and fit their roles very good, except Heather Graham. I must admit her acting wasn't so convincing, it's very hard to believe her character is a prostitute (but not because of her charming performance).There are few explicit scenes but directors mostly rely on formula ""things you don't see makes you even more scared when left to your imagination"", although I wouldn't recommend this film to children or those with really weak stomach. Without those scenes, I think, film would loose some of its ""creepiness"", and does not leave you with feeling directors put it there just so the film would be described as horror.For all those who fancy mysteries and don't mind few harsh scenes, go ahead, From Hell is more than decent film.",From Hell
232,monabassil,A far-fetched but stylish 'Hell',7,29 January 2002,"From Hell turns the mystery of Jack the Ripper, that late 19th century murderer of prostitutes, into a double political and religious conspiracy. A bit too far-fetched because this pseudo-conspiracy includes the British royal family and a fanatic Masonic sect'. Nevertheless, the movie does a fine job at hinting to the ridiculousness of religious and ethnic discrimination, and it succeeds in portraying the oppression of low-class women.Johnny Depp returns as the serious investigator (as last seen in Sleepy Hollow, notice the similarities?); he portrays Inspector Abberline, who follows his intuition and visions to solve his cases, and is appointed to solve this particular mystery. Depp's performance is genuine because he obviously takes his role very seriously. Abberline is clever, melancholic, psychoanalytical, clairvoyant, and, above all as opposed to his superiors, moral, even human. He is troubled of course, having lost his family in tragic circumstances, and is addicted to opium and laudanum, which aid him in his visions'. In the end, he sacrifices his relationship with Mary Kelly (and consequently his only chance for happiness) out of fear for her safety. An epic 'hero', more or less.The presence of his assistant (Robbie Coltrane, Hagrid in Harry Potter) is fortunate. I say fortunate because his character prevents the movie from taking itself too seriously. His sarcasm is tinted with genuine compassion towards the murderer's victims and a respectful affection towards Abberline. Coltrane gives a truly fine performance there, though it doesn't compare to Ian Holm's.Ian Holm (Bilbo in The Fellowship of the Ring) plays a double-role in the movie, and the transition from the poised physician to the devilish fanatic was remarkably done in terms of facial expression, voice tone, elocution, and, symbolically, size and makeup. In its own way, this movie is expressionistic. The prostitutes, or unfortunates' as they would rather call them, look and sound exactly as they're supposed to. They are worn-out, cynical, foulmouthed, but, in their own way, they look after each other. The odd one out here is the female lead, Mary Kelly, played by Heather Graham (argh!). She is too clean, too pure, and too elegant to be the companion of the other women. She is supposed to be of Irish decent, and naturally, the filmmakers made her a red-head. And a flamboyant one at that, with obviously dyed hair. Her so-called Irish accent sounds as convincing as my Swahili. If you should ever want to cast Heather Graham for your film, make sure you never show a close-up of her face; she's got the most inexpressive pair of painted ping-pong balls, er, eyes, I've ever seen. And now for the visuals: the only description that would fit here is psychedelic'. London has never looked foggier, with a smoky red sky and overall reddish ambiance. Abberline's visions of the murders are somewhat unsettling and gory (blood, flies on body parts, hazy photography etc...), but it's never cheap horror. Even the murder scenes are cleverly choreographed' so that we experience the act more through sound and feel rather than explicit violence. The whole mood of the movie is more graphically melancholic and dark than cheap and gory, really.
Though not quite from hell', it's the survival of the fittest in the gloomy streets of Victorian London, where corruption rules till the end.",From Hell
233,dltdvd,An admirable piece of art...,8,11 July 2002,"I have to admit that this is the first film I've seen directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. The twin brothers directed ""Menace II Society"" and various other street crime dramas. Their latest film, ""From Hell"" -- starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Ian Holm -- is a street drama of a different sort.Set on the streets of London in 1888, ""From Hell"" focuses on Jack the Ripper, and his infamous serial-murdering spree of innocent prostitutes. Johnny Depp plays Inspector Fred Abberline, who is sent to investigate these most gruesome killings, along with his partner Peter Godley, played by Robbie Coltrane. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly, a prostitute suspected of being one of Jack the Ripper's victims, who helps the two detectives search the murderer.In reality, nobody knows for sure who Jack the Ripper was. This is what makes the film so interesting. There are so many people in the movie who are suspected of being a serial killer, and this keeps you guessing until the film reveals the killer's true [fictional] identity. There are often times where you hear the killer's voice, and even times where you're actually seeing the contents in his home. But you never really figure his identity until the story tells you whom.Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, ""From Hell"" is so well-directed, contains such lavish sets, and great costume design, that you actually believe you're roaming the streets of London during 1888. There are times where the sky is even painted red, possibly to indicate bloodshed, as the film has a lot of that. This is all what helps the picture seem more disturbing.""From Hell"" is a film in which the characters are likeable, and where you're absolutely disturbed when witnessing prostitutes get their organs torn out. It's actually an incredible experience. The murders are so accurate, the filmmakers even did research on how exactly the corpses were positioned, and where the wounds were. You actually believe the film came from Hell. B+",From Hell

236,#1 Gracie,"Sleek, Stylish, but at Times Familiar Thriller",8,3 November 2001,"You enter a world where the sky is dark, and the streets of cobblestone match. The streets are crawling with late-night walkers and hookers at work. A streak of murder has been striking these prostitutes, with their bodies being slashed and their organs being removed. You have entered the world of ""From Hell"", a decently crafted thriller about Jack the Ripper.Set in 1888 London, prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather Graham) and her friends (also prostitutes, of course) aren't exactly in the best of the times. Their boss is demanding a pay of 4 pounds a week, and in a much bigger problem, a mysterious killer, who the residents merely call Jack the Ripper, is sweeping through the streets of London, slashing specific prostitutes in a pattern. The police force, along with working on the case themselves, decide to call on the help of Detective Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), an opium-addict who, while under the influence, sees visions of how prostitutes will be murdered by Jack the Ripper...and which prostitute is next (insert suspense music here).This was not your typical hack 'em up, kill everyone, gore and blood all over the place movie. Yes, the movie had lots of gore (this movie is NOT for sensitive stomachs) and lots of blood, but it also contained substance amidst all the killings and violence. Many (too many) thrillers rely on slashing and murder and gore to support the movie fully, without containing a story, but ""From Hell"" provided a good script, a good and followable story, and...well, the filler needed to make a good movie a good movie.
The one thing I would've preferred to be left from the story were the cliche`s. The script contained familiar territory that I've seen before, many times. The best example I can give without spoiling anything is the distinguishing of Mary Kelly from the rest of her prostitute friends. The movie took the tired route of making Mary Kelly prettier, well-kept, wearing makeup, and well-dressed, while her friends...well, looked like poor streetwalkers: no makeup, tattered dresses, etc. I'm tired of movies making the lead girl look more well-bred than her friends, because it seems unrealistic. Why not just make Mary Kelly actually look like a prostitute, and not like a rich, pretty girl who finds herself amongst a bunch of lesser-looking friends? Or if Mary Kelly looks like this, why not make her friends look the same? It might seem more realistic this way.The pacing in the movie was good, but the movie dragged. The movie  actually felt like it was two hours long, and that was a little exhausting. Don't think I have a short attention span-I've been able to sit through movies like ""Traffic"", ""Magnolia"", and ""AI"", all of which are longer than ""From Hell"", and I didn't have any trouble doing so. Those movies didn't feel like their lengths, and ""From Hell"" did.The acting was good. Johnny Depp delivered a great performance as Detective Abberline, making his character believable. I wouldn't say Oscar-caliber, but performances don't have to be Oscar-worthy to be good. Heather Graham was pretty good too-at times she seemed a little wooden, and I think her character would've been more believable if she seemed more scared about Jack the Ripper. I knew she was concerned, but she sometimes seemed too mello about her life being in danger, like, ""Oh, well, Jack the Ripper is sweeping through London and killing my friends, and I may be next...la dee da dee da!""The movie was cinematically brilliant. The murder scenes were well-filmed; one murder was seen as merely darkness with slashes of light being the only thing seen. The best moments cinematically were during Detective Abberline's Opium dreams-you can't even go into description about how great they really were.Overall the movie was very chic and very enjoyable. Take away the cliche`s, and make the movie move quicker, and it would've received those two extra points from me.8/10, B+",From Hell
237,ktappe,Wonderful look at 1888 London,8,26 October 2001,"To look at ""From Hell"" as a slasher or gore film is to miss the forest for the trees. The true value of this film is to gain insight into the ways of life in Victorian London. Few of us can imagine what life was like for the folks that we seeportrayed in this film and if one looks beyond the plot one can learn much. How often have any of us seen what an opium den was like or how the poor had tosleep upright in doss houses or heard what a dank, busy London streetsounded and looked like at night? No, the film wasn't 100% historicallyaccurate, taking liberties with the facts in the Ripper case, but that should be obvious to anyone viewing. Take the investigation with a grain of salt but not what the film has to say about the slice of the human experience it shows you. Further, do not discount the excellent acting that From Hell contains. Anyone who discounted Heather Graham's abilities based on what they saw in The SpyWho Shagged Me needs to eat their words. Admittedly Johnny Depp's facialexpression changed little (even when he was having his drug-induced visions), but Ian Holm always brings his all to any role he fills and Liz Moscrop'sincarnation of Queen Victoria is uncanny. Also, the direction of From Hell nicely complemented the unsettling nature of the material it was portraying. Viewers will feel as if they are a part of the disjointed mind of a serial killer. From Hell transcends being a movie and is more aptly described as anexperience.

Because of the subject, the movie is filmed almost entirely at night, ala The Crow or Darkman, which may be slightly disturbing to some.The movie encompasses conflict on many levels, which in itself is a valid description of Victorian England. Perhaps that's why it succeeds, by not getting bogged down into the somewhat gruesome basic plot-line.

Patricia Cornwell spent 3 million dollars on a new investigation with Scotland Yard and she came up with new DNA evidence that links a letter to Walter Sickert, the famous British painter.

250,O.N.,Quite acceptable thriller,7,8 August 2002,"As far as thrillers go, there haven't been many worth watching in recent times. I'm pleased to say that ""From Hell"", although not perfect, is a neatly crafted and entertaining horror/drama/period piece.
I was a little surprised when this film was first released to find out that it was directed by the Hughes brothers of ""Dead Presidents"" fame. Although competent film-makers and better-than-average storytellers, I wasn't particularly convinced that they could recreate 19th century England and the time of Jack the Ripper without at least some American overtones.Fortunately, they have reproduced this era in a very credible manner, with thanks to a number of their cast and crew. Cinematographer Peter Deming has created a claustrophobic and grimy London enveloped in sleaze and darkness and a sky that rarely seems to be anything but dull, even in the daytime shots. Veteran actors in the cast, particularly Ian Holm and Robbie Coltrane, add class to the production and Johnny Depp is probably the best choice out of Hollywood's younger male stars to play someone other than an American.The only slightly negative thread is the casting of Heather Graham as a young English prostitute. She just doesn't feel that convincing in the part (especially beside her more experienced costars) but thankfully her role doesn't overshadow proceedings.""From Hell"" tells the tale of Jack the Ripper, who in London 1888, became one of the world's first serial killers, murdering a number of prostitutes on the east side of town. Inspector Johnny Depp, who has clairvoyant powers courtesy of his drug addiction, is hauled onto the case by baffled sergeant Robbie Coltrane. In his investigation, he is aided by prostitute Heather Graham, whose coworkers on the street seem to be turning up gruesomely murdered at an alarming rate. What follows is a dissection through the ranks of both lower and upper class London to eventually trace out the killer and his motives. Saying much more about the plotline would reveal too much, but similar to David Fincher's ""Seven"", it is nice to see a serial killer actually given a personality and a reason (even if quite skewed) for their actions. On the downside, I was able to pick who Jack the Ripper was very early on and the ending does come across as somewhat contrived.However, in a season of disappointing thrillers, ""From Hell"" is a welcome addition to the box-office. Although not a pure shock-fest (it is quite graphic and couldn't have been too far off an Australian R18+ certificate) it is a reasonably intelligent serial killer film for adults and certainly a change from all of the teenage slasher-flick clones which seem to be flooding the market.7/10",From Hell

The real terror is not the murders, the way they are being carried out, the beating heart in the hand of Jack or the (scarce, anyway) gore. Nope. The real terror is the fact that you can't escape. That malady is not a state of mind, it's a whole world.The fact that for one to find hope, another must vanish. The fact that there is no action without reaction.Dep delivers another excellent performance - might be his best so far. Despite the baby-face. The Hughes brothers do a great work with the light on their star - they use the light (or the absence of it) to wake inner feelings and make more point than other directors make with the whole film.
The semi-happy end is really a work of art (I haven't seen the comix so I don't know if it is taken from there or is genuine).  And it only drags the helpless viewer even deeper into the abyss of this world.
Yes, it is not a *happy* movie. It ain't a ""who done it"" movie either - the basic storyline is used as the mean, not the goal. And it certainly ain't no *horror* movie - there are no ghosts, no supernatural beings, not walking dead, no gross details, very little gore, no detailed autopsies, no cataclysmic events.I think I should give out an advice to those not seen ""From Hell"" yet: Do not go to watch a ""horror movie"". Or a thriller. Or whatever. Prepare yourself for a different experience.It is a great movie and one I am happy to have seen. And at the same time I am very unhappy. Because I can't let that depressing feeling go away. I can't look at my world as I used to. Thousands of little details capture my attention. Previously innocent moves and words are not innocent any more. The world has a totally different meaning for me now. And four little words are in my mind 24 hours a day:There is no escape",From Hell
256,zedex,Chilling,8,9 February 2002,"_CONTAINS SPOILERS_ From Hell is based on (but not fully faithful to) the murders of Jack the Ripper, a serial killer who lived in 19th century London. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham are the leads (as Inspector Abbeline, the man in charge of solving the case, and Mary Kelly, the tart with a heart). This is one thing that always annoys me about American movies set outside of America: they always feel the need to cast someone American in the lead role, no matter how appalling their accent is. After seeing plenty of good films spoiled by accents (Ordinary Decent Criminal comes to mind) i was worried about this one, and my fears were half justified. While the accents aren't bad, they still have a hint of fakeness about them. This is almost made worse by the decision to cast decent British actors too, such as Robbie Coltraine as Depp's sarcastic helper. I suppose I should just be thankful they didn't try to get Heather Graham to put on a traditional Irish accent. However, despite this fault, it is a brilliant movie. The leads aren't too bad when they're not speaking, and the rest of the cast are excellent. The directing and camera work is stylish, for example a blood-red sunset is shown between two of the scenes, and Depp's visions are suitably hazy and unclear. The film is gory in the extreme, but not for the sake of it. It is showing the horror of the Ripper's crimes, and the brutality within it all. The picture of 19th century London is very realistic (the poor treatment of the whores, the old boy attitude of the chief of police claiming ""it couldn't be an educated man, it must have been a butcher, a foreigner or a Jew"" & the general dirt, grime and seediness of it all). The plot is dotted with holes and the ending is a bit hard to swallow (the concept that there is an entirely separate line to the English crown living somewhere in Ireland is possible, but very unlikely). However, the film achieves its goal, creating a real sense of fear as Jack lures his victims in, then viciously kills them. I would recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach, tell them to ignore the plot holes and enjoy an atmospheric horror film. Score: 8/10",From Hell

But this film gives you a good look of Jack and the mysterie around him. Because nobody can tell for sure that Jack has really lived his life with killing people. So any film about him is pure guessing about what happened.After you've seen from hell, you can tell people a little bit more about jack, but on the other side you can tell people nothing new about jack. So why is this film then so good? Well first of all the atmosphere they've captured in this film is taking you right back into the past. beside that there is a scene in the film where you see Johnny depp taking drugs with sugar and absint, besides that there is also a lot of opium involved. but all with all it is a very good movie. so if you haven't seen him this is absolute a must see film.go and check it out. see ya Gijs",From Hell
259,crossrad,A story of Victorian London told without empathy,1,7 June 2009,"Unfortunately I found this film a real chore to watch. Perhaps the directors, coming from Detroit, do not have enough connection with England and have not recognised this and obtained the assistance they need, but their portrayal of Victorian London is very much a cliché. The outside scenes look studio bound, with the sky always blood red, not at all typical of England's Gray skies. In one scene a drunk is dragged across the ground, drawing attention to the ground being far too clean to be realistic. In one scene there is a break-in, with a hand reaching in through a window to open a highly polished brass lock. So much for the image of Victorian London as a dirty place where the population is more interested in drinking, prostitutes and other vices than in good housekeeping! There are a large number of identical characters - stunning looking prostitutes in bright dresses often giving an articulate discourse on how hard done by they are, and evil men in sober suits slashing them in dark alleyways. The film is shot from a 21st century liberal perspective, not with the values of the time.It is a few weeks since I watched this movie and I cannot say that I recollect the plot. But I can remember that I didn't find the movie worthwhile to watch at the time.",From Hell
260,phil0011,"A stylish film, but has little to offer.",7,14 August 2003,"A dark and meticulous tale, based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I'm talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters, and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn't stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes. Why did I enjoy this film, I hear you ask? For a start, the direction was superb - the streets of London looked grimy, while the `unfortunates' (i.e., prostitutes) wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate. This produced a wonderful atmosphere, creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking (and very gruesome). Johnny Depp's performance (as the detective Abberline), as always, was hugely enjoyable to watch. He played his character in a very subtle way - halfway between comic and serious. He portrays a desperate man, constantly resorting to drugs so he can pass through the day. Depp and the filmmakers see him as a version of Sherlock Holmes, constantly finding clues that other police officers have overlooked (cliched, yes, but somehow Depp provides a little bit of originality). Abberline even suggests that the killer must be a learned man! How could this be?! While dismissed by all the other characters in the film (for a learned man would never commit acts of such debauchery), we as an audience know better not to trust a detective like this - their preposterous ideas are usually right. Another actor to praise in this is the wonderful Ian Holm. He plays his character with a wry little smile, seemingly enjoying every line he says. His interactions with Depp are great to watch.While the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled, you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.For those that care I gave this film 7/10",From Hell

262,tony-walton,"""Orright Meery Pappins?"" - return of the fake Mockney accent.",5,19 August 2003,"The movie was enjoyable enough. Good atmosphere, not a bad plot (making the Ripper a political murder was certainly a new twist), good set design, good lighting, plenty of gore and so on.There was however one person involved with this film who completely ruined it for me. That person should be buried in sand at least a cable's length from the shore. Who was this person?  Johnny Depp's voice coach, that's who. That accent was just plain wrong in several respects.Firstly it wasn't a London accent - presumably it was meant to be a Cockney accent but they didn't even try for generic ""London"". It was an ""Estuary"" accent - a sort of mishmash generalised ""South East England"" accent which has become widespread on TV over the past 15-20 years . In US terms, let's say they'd taken a Trenton, NJ accent and said ""OK, that's close enough to a Brooklyn accent; they're both in the north-eastern US"" when it MATTERED that the speaker was from Brooklyn. Secondly an accent like that would not (even in the 21st century) denote ""middle-class"" (as Depps character was described); it's a very working class accent. Nothing in the least wrong with that, but it simply doesn't work (and it's simply not conceivable that someone would have made his way up from the ""working classes"" to become a police Inspector in the 1880s). Thirdly, and what wrecked it for me completely, was that Depp's voice coach had Depp doing a more-than-workmanlike impression of David Beckham (English soccer player and alleged style icon). The impression was so accurate that I have to believe he did it on purpose. I kept waiting for the Inspector to start discussing England's chances of qualifying for the European Soccer Championships!",From Hell
263,kevin_blaze,"Jack the Ripper is the ostensible subject of Albert and Allen Hughes' From Hell, but this legendary figure is more a point of departure, an obviously sensational hook, than the film's focus.",6,7 January 2002,"30 Second Bottom Line: The infamous Jack the Ripper serial killer mystery unfolds in Victorian England as a stylistic who dun it.From Hell is an exciting murder mystery with a number of hints about who dun it to keep things interesting every step of the way. Depp gives his expected, outstanding and other worldly performance. Ian Holm, Katrin Cartlidge, Robbie Coltrane and Ian Richardson and some of the unnamed prostitutes give the film an edge that takes us back a century in time. Heather Graham is OK and I'm pleased to see her doing something beyond Say it Isn't So and more along the lines of Sidewalks of New York. She is, however, a little too pretty, sophisticated, charming and clean for a street ho. Katrin Cartlidge would have been a better Mary. It's a little bit of a stretch to envision the Inspector and the whore Mary falling in love, but stranger things have happened.It's always gratifying to see actors, writers and directors grow; and certainly the Hughes Brothers are doing that. They have not made a lot of films but each one is very good. The two could be a Stanley Kubrick in the making, as he only made 13 films during a long, respected and controversial career. Since 1993, they've made Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp. From Hell is more sophisticated while still retaining a dark tone that is not depressing. Peter Deming as cinematographer has outdone himself with From Hell and Mulholland Drive. It's clearly Oscar caliber work.Although From Hell is based on a comprehensive novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, with the focus on a real killer in 1888, the film is not trying to be a JFK and convince us how it really happened. That said, when you realize who the killer is you are faced with an interesting hypothesis.Jack the Ripper may have been crazy, but he was acting out of logic (his own to be sure) and for a reason other than wanting to kill a few prostitutes. The fog in London finally is lifted on the murder mystery and on the Hughes Brothers being great directors.Message on the movie: We can't always have what we want from life. Evil exists.

266,dane11,"Compelling Cinema, but is it art?",7,17 May 2004,"The Hughes Brothers version of the Jack The Ripper story is compelling cinema. From the opening credits to the blood red clouds hanging over the city a strong sense of doom prevails and pulls us in.  It's tough to turn away from the screen thanks to the stylized Victorian England look and dark, eerie streets, not to mention the well-known mystery of the Ripper, himself! I own this movie on DVD and have watched it a couple of times, but recently I saw it on Cable and I was still pulled right in.  Is it Johnny Depp's performance that pulls me in? No. Is it the fresh-faced look of Heather Graham as a low-rent prostitute? No. I watch this movie for two reasons: one the story of Jack the Ripper is always intriguing; and two I love the way the Hughes brothers made everything sooooo dark!  To begin with, the story is very dark and gruesome so the heavily shadowed scenes, the damp, gloomy, streets, and the dimly lit rooms all add to further the murky ambience of the story.  There are brief moments in some scenes where everything is so black that the viewer has to strain to see and guess what is going on. This isn't cheap film making, this is powerful direction that is seldom attempted in movies today.  While the violence is there, at the same time, it's not there. We see a shiny knife blade, a slash and we hear the rip of the skin and then we see blood, but with the exception of one very visual murder, we don't really see the victims get cut.  The Hughes brothers take a risk with this movie.  In a typical serial killer movie we would see the knife cut into the victim. We would see organs ripped out and limbs chopped off, but this movie leaves much of the actual violence to our imagination.  Don't get me wrong, there's enough blood and gore in this to cause some to lose their lunch.  But truth be known (and the Hughes brothers understand this) the viewer's imagination is usually stronger than any visual that can be put into a scene.   That's the magic of this film.  The Hughes brothers focus on the drama, the conspiracy and the character interaction more than they do the violence of the story. 
In 1888 Jack the Ripper brutally murdered five prostitutes, but that's only half the story according to this movie.  Many theories have been suggested as to the identity of the Ripper over the years.  The story provides numerous Ripper suspects from a villainous and slimy gang member all the way up to Prince Albert; thus covering most of the typical Ripper candidates that have ever been mentioned.  `From Hell' promotes a theory on the Ripper story that includes the Masons, the Royal family and a police cover up. Overall, we focus more on Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) and a band of prostitutes who appear to be the Ripper's targets than the actual murders themselves.  Johnny Depp is a little too handsome and young looking to be the over-worked, (in this movie  opium/laudanum user and clairvoyant) career constable Inspector Abberline.  Though I like Depp as an actor, it seems to me that he typically adds a certain modern feel to his roles (Chocolat and Pirates of the Caribbean are perfect examples of this).   Heather Graham dresses the part of a prostitute, but otherwise, she acts and looks more like a rough and edgy Mary Poppins.  Her stunning red hair is nearly a character in itself.  The romance that blooms in the story is a bit forced, but it does create an interesting-albeit purely fictional-subplot.  The surrounding actors, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, and Ian Richardson are all excellent choices whose presence adds to the style and richness of the film. The Hughes Brothers have shown their style and talent in every film they've made (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents and American Pimp), but this movie takes their abilities to the next level.  From strange camera angles, and the effective use of color that separates the slums from the upper class world, to dreary lighting, and the period costumes and settings the Hughes brothers provide a visual feast for the viewer to devour. While the story, based on the graphic novel `From Hell', is a bit contrived at times, the viewer cannot pull away.  The characters and the fast pacing of the film will keep most viewers from noticing miscast actors and fictionalized events.   Is it art?  No.  Is it good film making. Yes.  This is a movie that should be seen.  Just don't see it alone.",From Hell

When this movie came out, I wanted to see it, but a friend told me the solution and I was disgusted.  ANOTHER movie based on this tired theory?  Aren't movies based on historical events supposed to try and work in the known facts?  I finally got the movie (free) and was appalled.  They worked in enough facts to prove to me they did some research, but then ignored things like what these women did prior to their deaths, who they were, what their lives were like.  These women were not a clique of ""unfortunates"" who hung around together, though they might have known one another.  I mean, they did the same thing and lived in the same area!  But are we supposed to believe the police were stupid enough to miss something like a group of friends being killed off one by one?  If there had been that connection, wouldn't that be the MAIN thing known about the Ripper?It just bothers me that they are still doing Ripper movies with the same tired solution in this day and age.  This looks it was done just to take advantage of the ability to show blood and gore.  Why can't we start with the Ripper Files and fit the story around it? If you keep harping on the Royal solution, people will believe it that is what happened, because not everyone can read Jack the Ripper A to Z (great book!)  I am sure that if you ask anyone they will swear the Royal solution is the truth, because that is all they ever see.Johnny Depp is eye candy and they might have impressed some with the blood and gore, but I'd be far more impressed by a serious attempt to tell it like it *might* have happened.  This theory has been discounted LONG ago; it's time for something else, please! I know they were going to do a Maybrick movie, then suddenly they didn't - I assumed it was because they decided the diary was a fake.  Hey, fake or not, it would have made an interesting story, and something DIFFERENT.  Are they afraid someone might have taken it seriously?  If that's the case, then why are they still promoting this obvious fiction?  I don't see how it is any different.  Except this one's already been done.

270,Evil_Will_Hunting,Jack 'n the Hood,8,10 December 2002,"7 out of 10Whatever happened to movies about little kids and their animals?  You know-`Black Beauty,' `Free Willy,' `My Dog Skip'-that sort of thing.  I remember coming home from school as a kid to my little sister watching `My Little Pony: The Movie' and thinking, you know, the world's an okay place. I could leave the screen door unlocked and go sip a lemonade on the back porch without a care in the world.Now everywhere you go people are killing each other and making movies about it.  I figured at first that this was just a modern trend since, you know, the world's going to hell (or is it from hell?  No, to hell) anyway.  But apparently this sort of thing's been going on for a while.  It's just that they didn't have movies back then.So I guess a movie about Jack the Ripper has been a long time coming. Now growing up, I always just understood Jack to be someone else's dad who coached t-ball and worked at a factory and lurked around elementary school playgrounds ripping little girls' clothes off.  Hell, it made sense at the time.  Needless to say, I never included myself in Jack's exclusive victim demographic.  If anything I envied him and tried to emulate his work during my playground fare.After seeing `From Hell,' I am now much more scared of Jack the Ripper. Yeah, I know, he's dead (or is he?-I smell a sequel.  No, he's actually dead.)  But what's to stop little Tommy now from becoming Tommy the Ripper or little Susie from becoming Susie the Ripperess?  I am truly scared for all of us.I suppose that's the mark of a good film (or is it?-I smell a trick ending. Yeah, it's a good film.)  Allen and Albert Hughes (`Menace II Society,' `Dead Presidents') have taken a rather unusual spin on their usual theme of violent suburban life in `From Hell,' and for the most part it is a glorious one.  It took keen eyes to recognize that the victimization of prostitutes, or `unfortunates,' in late 19th Century England was merely a derivative form of the inner city chaos that many live with still a hundred years later.`From Hell' stars Johnny Depp (`Ed Wood,' `Dead Man,' `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas') as the laudanum/absinthe addict Inspector Frederick Abberline who has been pulled out from the opium den just in time to star in the new Hughes Brothers' film `From Hell.'  Just kidding-I love Johnny Depp. Actually they need him to fry Jack the Ripper's gourd.  And since all the drugs he takes give him magical powers and a British accent, this is not the exact same movie as `Sleepy Hollow.'Abberline is quick to fall in love with one of the unfortunates, or `sluts,' Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, `Boogie Nights') because she is the only one of them with box office appeal (sorry guys, no naked here-or is there?  I won't say-or will I?  Read on.) and has the least dirt applied to her face in the makeup room.  He is quick to get the help of Sir William Gull (Ian Holm, `The Sweet Hereafter,' `Brazil'), physician to the royal family, to aid in tracking a killer who appears to be an educated man with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy (Jack the Ripper).  And a budget for grapes.But Jack the Ripper is quicker at killing them all-or is he?  I won't say. As opposed to the graphic novel on which it is based, `From Hell' wisely chooses to conceal the identity of Jack until the end, so it has the same effect as Christopher Walken's appearance in `Sleepy Hollow.'  Come to think of it, just replace Walken as Jack, Christina Ricci for Heather Graham, and Johnny Depp for Johnny Depp and it's the same damn movie.  Aw man.Actually, Depp was better as Ichabod Crane, but `From Hell' is probably a better movie.  Granted, it's sort of a one note film-Jack kills a prostitute, her friends wince, Depp warms up the opium cooker, rinse and repeat.  But it's reasonably well written, even better acted (by Heather Graham of all people), and even still better filmed-it looks like something between `Moulin Rouge' and `Requiem for a Dream.' Of course, `From Hell' is strictly entertainment for all you gore- and Heather Graham (keep reading) skin- hounds.  But the restraint of the gore (compared to such recent fare as `Hannibal'), as well as the allusions to 19th Century medicine and freemasonry make this film creepy and disturbing as hell.  Or is it from hell?  Dammit, I've got to stop doing that.So, in conclusion, if you want to know if Heather Graham gets naked in this movie, you'll just have to see it for yourself.  Hahahahahaha.

I usually like Johnny Depp, but then I thought about The 9th Gate, which was a horrible movie.  Some of the trailers I had seen made the two look similar. Also, the time and place was given at the start of the movie, which led me to believe that some would take place in the past, but then shift to the present, which is a cheap trick some movies use.  Man, was I wrong.  I was taken on thrill ride that few movies take me on.  The plot is extremely deep and complicated and I was never able to correctly guess the outcome.  The movie is very film noire and is shot in a style similar to Se7en and Fight Club, specifically the way the film flashes between images quickly during some scenes.  The only thing I found lacking with the film is that it did not give very much background detail as to why Jack the Ripper was killing people.

For some it's a cunning plot (say, Twelve Monkeys), others it's great performances (take Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets).  For From Hell it's the casting.The key elements of the production are all competently done - late Victorian London is nicely and darkly reproduced, the plot just about stands up (depending on how bothered you are by the visions experienced by Depp's Inspector) and there are plenty of sound supporting appearances by some talented British actors (Ians Holm and Richardson to name but two).What I really enjoyed about this film was the chemistry in the two principal relationships - Johnny Depp and Heather Graham (who plays one of the group of prostitutes targetted by The Ripper) and Depp and Robbie Coltrane (who plays the Sergeant assisting the Inspector).  The relationship that grows between Depp and Graham is believable and the contrast of Coltrane's straight-forward approach with Depp's drug addiction and foresight is nicely played.It's not the best dark thriller ever made (it's certainly not a Horror film), but I'll wager it will be judged better than most everything else launched in Halloween season.",From Hell

It made me think about how much I have by not living in that era of human history. It was brutal for women who were forced to become prostitutes just to live if they were on their own, there were no other jobs for them. And even then it wasn't living.I saw it when it first came out on video and I haven't forgotten it since.And the story was good too, Johnny Deep was of course brilliant, I was more impressed with Heather Graham whose characters are usually more shallow, she was deep in this one.",From Hell

Yes, London looks miserable and morosely unpleasant, but it adds a degree of mystique and squalor to the tale.Using Americans as main characters and expecting them to master the cockney accent is a bridge too far, and if you pay attention you'll figure out the plot twist fairly early, but I enjoyed this film immensely, and if you suspend your disbelief, I'm certain that you will too!

Saying this to say I do adore this exotic and extremely handsome performer. I love his style in all of the films that I have been fortunate to see him in. I have been keeping up with him since 21 Jumpstreet, and he never ceases to amaze me! His dark brooding personality is just so surreal and their are not many actors (Christopher Walken another of my true favorites) that can take on these type of roles in filmmaking! The true artist are the writers and the filmmakers, the directors, but without the right personality behind the characters that have to be portrayed, what would these films be?  Johnny Depp is tops in this film.I would say anyone out there that loves the dark side of filming, go and see this film.

281,keenan-1,Darkly stylish--not based on reality.,8,17 May 2004,"The best thing about an enduring mystery is that people can feel free to take all sorts of liberties with the facts and create interesting ""what if"" scenarios.  FROM HELL is a perfect example.  For the record, the theory behind the killings is pretty much right out of JACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTION by Stephen Knight, and it's been pretty well discredited since it first came out twenty years ago, even though it makes a hell of an entertaining piece of fiction.I completely discount any criticisms of the movie where people say ""it didn't happen that way"".  Of course it didn't; that's why this is a fictional film and not a documentary.  It's very loosely based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, and about all it retains of it is the Duke of Clarence theory and the stylish look of the architecture.  It's enough to make the film beautiful to watch.Yes, I know that four of the five victims of Jack the Ripper were women in their late 40's, which on the streets of Victorian London would mean that they would resemble crones in their late 60's or early 70's.  Just try to make that fly past a Hollywood studio boss; the casting at least had women who looked fairly human rather than like fallen glamour girls.  I've read a couple of comments disparaging the accents.  Actually, Cockney accents were the norm in the street because people tried to blend in and often weren't eager to advertise Scottish or Irish origins.  I call special attention to the performance of Jason Flemyng in the role of Netley, the coachman, arguably the most fascinating and believable character in the whole production.  Most of his best scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, unfortunately, and yet he still manages to pull the movie together into a cohesive whole just by his presence.  (It must have been a heck of a fun role to play!)  As well, Sir Ian Holm deserves special mention for stepping in when the original choice for his role, Sir Nigel Hawthorne, tragically became ill and died just before the film went into production.  I have never seen Sir Ian in any role that I didn't find completely believable, and that ranges all the way from KING LEAR to his role in ALIEN, for heaven's sake.My interest in the whole Jack the Ripper case has been reawakened thanks to this movie, and I'm trying to hunt down a copy of Alan Moore's graphic novel (which is very difficult to find).  No, it's not even close to an approximation of what really happened; nobody will ever know the truth, Patricia Cornwell's arrogant claims notwithstanding.  It's still worth renting, if only for the beautifully ominous score and the fascinating transformation of Prague into Victorian London.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",From Hell

We get a gold-hearted prostitute whom the inspector falls in love with. We get the secret love child of the Prince of Wales and another gold-hearted prostitute. We get a ridiculous conspiracy and we're supposed to believe it's all historically accurate? Give me a break. Johnny Depp, as usual, is excellent, Heather Graham is indifferent.

But you can't pay me to try and sit through Benny and Joon or Cry Baby. Mr. Depp really hit the spot for me on this one. I believed in his character who albeit in a constant depressive state, or just plain jacked on opium, he was on his game in his hunt for the legendary Jack the Ripper.But he also had a good supporting cast,however, Ill omit Heather Graham. I don't know, I just didn't think she brought much to the movie and quite frankly I just thought she was just the whore with the most lines. But one of the final scenes took it home just based on sheer acting as Johnny Depp finally confronted who he believed was the madman.The scares are there people and so is the gore so if you want a fine-tuned re-telling of the most famous serial killer known, plus being led by a veteran who can do it all, then go grab the nachos and watch From Hell.",From Hell

I just couldn't picture Heather in anything less then a peppy gorgeous blond role (ie Austin Powers), although I have to say she surprised me in this role as the 19th century whore with the tender heart.

It does do a damn fine job though and gets as much of the details in as possible. The only problem I had was that it tries to turn the film into a whodunnit kind of thriller with the stories idea of the killers identity being revealed at the end. In the book we know from the beginning who it's supposed to be and we follow him around as he commits the murders and we hear his thoughts and his ponderings. This approach that the film takes cheapens the artistic value a little bit but having said that it does make up for it in other areas.The horror is actually horrible and the thrills are actually thrilling and Johnny Depp's cockney accent is pretty good, it just sounds weird because its coming from his mouth which is something we are not use to.",From Hell

It really gives your surround speakers something to play with. Then there is the film. The scenes that stuck out to me best were the flickers of grainy, distorted flashbacks that i can best describe as ""Something out of a Marlin Manson Video"". The whole ambience fits both the story of a serial killer and the slums of old London. The makers of this ""almost epic"" did a good job making it hard for the viewer to figure out who was Jack the Ripper.

But the acting varies between decent and excellent(the latter on the part of Johnny Depp and Ian Holm), the script issolid (structured, unlike the book, as a mystery where you don'tfind out the killer's identity until the end), and the visuals aregorgeous -- a bleak Victorian landscape under a smoky red sky.Particularly nice are Abberline (Depp)'s green-tinted opium visionsof the murders. The gore is also appropriately restrained for thefirst two-thirds or so of the film, such that when we finally see oneof the women's throats being slashed (it opens up like a mouth),the sight is truly shocking. I was also glad to see that despitelacking the novel's depth, the film retained a strong focus on themurders as the act of a man embodying the violence of adominator society. The film successfully associates that society'sracism with its oppression of women -- a significant ideologicalstatement. The ripper's vision at the climax of the film (the lastmurder) has him being applauded by the all-male members of therich, educated upper class, making his vision of himself asserving his class clear.Finally, kudos to Robbie Coltrane as the sergeant -- his earthy,practical character made an excellent contrast with Depp'sintuitive, emotional Abberline.",From Hell

The movie, ""From Hell"" starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham is about the investigations of a young detective (Johnny Depp) as he tries to track the infamous Jack the Ripper. Along the way he falls in love with a young prostitute (Heather Graham)who is one of the Ripper's targets and is torn between his commitment to the case and his desire to protect his sexed crazed lover.There's only one thing that keeps me from recommending this film: it's strange plot. The film has characters running all over the place and in my humble opinion often dosen't explain why they're doing what they are. Especially that strange brotherhood crap we find out the Ripper belongs to. Another that vexes me is the fact that the film tries to get you to beleive that some old geezer is the one commiting these crimes. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we haven't ever figured out who the real Ripper was. We only have our assumptions. I'm not one to beleive that some fat elderly dude was killing all these hookers.

This is a shame, as the film actually has a lot of good things going for it. Some genuinely chilling set pieces and a suitably grim visual style make for some scary moments. Sadly, particularly in the first half of the film, the Hughes Brothers (directing) seem to spend too much time trying to be visually clever when they should be putting more effort into getting on with the story. When they dispense with the visual gimmickry and the action is allowed to take off, the film is extremely gripping. On another level, the ending is particularly moving. A previous reviewer referred to the film's historical inaccuracies in depth, so I won't retread the same ground, but suffice to say that anyone familiar with the events will be distracted by these, although anyone new to the story wouldn't be affected.

I mean, why are those movies always so ""high-resolutioned"" and visually clean? ""From hell"" for example should have been shot in paler, darker colors in order to transport the dark-creeping atmospheres which Alan Moore originally wanted to display. A horror-movie should never be visually to ""clean"". Take ""Ringu"" ( the original, Japanese version of ""The Ring"") it is shot in a low resolution, sometimes with a blurry filter, and that fits just perfect to the movies ""groove"". From hell has no groove, you are aware each second that you are indeed watching a movie. Where is the illusion? Furthermore the movies speed is way to fast. Most cuts would fit in an action movie rather than in this one. Besides, the graphic novel is revisited very poorly. A mainstream-plot replaces the novels, highly interesting, psychological and philosophical storytelling. Just take Jonny Depp, mix it with a poor love story, use a action movie pace, and you'll have your perfect block(=blood)buster.Just another forgettable movie, done completely in a wrong way I'm sick of Hollywood ruining genuine and interesting plots stolen from evry media imaginable, cutting and amputating them... and what's worse: without letting people know the original even exists.4 of 10",From Hell
298,Sarlic,Fantastic Visuals Make this Jack the Ripper Story,9,20 October 2001,"Well, I just returned from seeing the movie From Hell, a movie that I have been anticipating since I first heard about it before summer.  In many respects, I am not disappointed, but I feel there are a few things that must be said.SPOILERS BELOW!!!For starters, anyone with a knowledge of Ripper History must know that the infamous Freemason Conspiracy Theory, published by Stephen Knight, has been completely cast out as untrue.  It was discovered after the death of its author that some of the research was ""created"" to help make the conspiracy. Knight stretched certain aspects of the facts of the case (the ""Juwes"", as the biggest) to help prove his conspiracy theory....which, quite frankly, is the most exciting of all the Ripper theories, though the most far-fetched. Of course Hollywood would pick that one.""From Hell"" is very detailed about some of the facts of the case.  Martha Tabram, the first murder in the movie, is not listed among the canonical five victims (Mary Nichols, Annie Chapman, Liz Stride, Katherine Eddows, and Mary Kelly) but Tabram, along with about a dozen other women, are theorized to be victims of the Ripper.  The death scenes were not as gory as I might expect;  though to show the body of Mary Kelly as seen in the black and white photograph at the actual murder scene 100 years ago would surely give the move an NC-17 rating.  The murders were handled well, with just enough of the ""gore"" factor to give them the scare factor.Depp gives a very solid performance as Fredderick Abberline (which is pronounced a-ber-leen, not a-ber-line as far as I know) though much of his character was made to suite the story.  From a historical standpoint, Abberline did not smoke opium, was married, and was actually ""demoted"" to returned to Whitechapel for the Ripper cases.  And he certainly did not die afterwards.  Depp, as we all know from his previous endeavors, plays a wonderful detective, and he handled this role beautifully, as far as I'm concerned.Ian Holm as William Gull was solid.  I was a bit perplexed about the change in his voice from certain scenes to the next.  I know that originally, Nathaniel Hawthorne was casted as Gull, but I'm unsure if he shot any of the scenes -- I'm wondering if his voice was used as the Ripper's.Coltrane adds some of the very few comical moments, and Graham gives an pretty good performace as Mary Kelly.I read somewhere that there were two endings shot for this film, one of which Depp and Graham got drunk and acted badly for on purpose so that it couldn't be used.  When I read this, I thought they would be doing this for an ending where everyone ""lived happily ever after.""  I was sorely mistaken. This movie's take on Mary Kelly living and/or falling for Abberline or even MEETING Abberline is completely made up.  It does help the plot along, however.The most wonderful aspect of the film, in my opinion, are the visuals -- the scenery.  Absolutely brilliant shots of London in what it could have looked like in the 19th century.  The shots of the skyline above the rooftops of the East End were equally breathtaking.  The prostitutes (other than the always pretty Heather Graham) were given a very true-to-life makeup job. The Hugh Brothers did a fantastic job in this respect.While not altogether historically accurate, ""From Hell"" was a very good movie that I will more than likely go to a second time and definitely purchase the DVD from.  If you're looking for a more-historically based fictional account, I'd try the Michael Caine film from 1988 (though I must warn you.... they choose the ""conspiracy theory"" as well).  It was made for TV, so the gruesomeness is cut out of the film completely.  But if you are looking for a visually stunning account of the Ripper's escapades, as well as a semi-realistic look at the blood that would result from his antics, see ""From Hell.""You won't be disappointed.***/****",From Hell
299,klkitchens,An excellent telling of one of the many theories...,9,22 October 2001,"Jack the Ripper appeared and disappeared after a relatively short killing spree.  However, as he was never caught and the gruesome nature of his killings, the Ripper legend still has steam after 100+ years.It's been told and examined in many films, most notably the ""Time After Time"" film with Malcom McDowell, David Warner, and Annie Steenburgen.""From Hell"" takes its name from one of the notes presumed to be written by the Ripper and delivered to investigating authorities.  The story of ""From Hell"" addresses the details of the legend and a quite entertaining and mostly logical way.  Depp, as usual, offers quite a turn as Inspector Abberline, the chief investigator.  This is definitely a must-see film.Be warned.  Most of the gore is kept to a minimum, seen indirectly.  This makes it even more shocking when a few graphic scenes take hold of your mind and refuse to let go.",From Hell
300,t_gilks,Good direction of a lame script,6,20 October 2001,"""From Hell"" is certainly a stylish exercise in gruesome horror/mystery, but the Hughes Brothers' direction is wasted on a script that turns ridiculous by film's end.Jack the Ripper is a killer defending the British throne (currently occupied by Queen Victoria) from an illegitimate child born to a Catholic prostitute (the movie makes it seem like being a Catholic is worse than being a prostitute) who could be heir. His goal is to 'eliminate' all those who are aware of the child's existence. The Inspector Abaline character (Johnny Depp) works well, as does the role of the Watson-like Seargent Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and even the nonsense of the Queen Victoria conspiracy has a certain charming mystique to it.However, Jack The Ripper is not satisfied with just killing, but insists on performing brutal mutilations and the removal of organs. Why does he do this, when he could just throw them off a building or toss them in a lake? I guess because the writers think that gruesome violence will help sell their movie. The explanation is some ridiculous and desperate story of Jack being so insane, that he thinks thoroughly butchering his victims will somehow represent Jewish struggle, or Jewish oppression, or something. I couldn't really tell, and I didn't really care. It didn't seem like the writers did either.That said, the Hughes brothers definitely created a haunting atmosphere through the first act, and although anyone who has seen enough movies and knows enough actors won't take long to figure out who the killer is, the suspense is still real, and will make you eager to see the story unwrap, when you're not dreading a closeup of the victim.",From Hell
301,Nightflyre9,A wasted effort ...,5,24 October 2001,"Having had an interest in the Jack the Ripper case since childhood and also being a huge fan of historical thrillers, I approached the Hughes brothers' ""From Hell"" with a great deal of anticipation and perhaps, in retrospect, unfairly high expectations.  Helmed by talented directors, starring a spectacular cast of actors, and fueled by an obviously unrestrained budget, this lavish production was, to my mind, a can't-miss proposition, its contribution to the edification of horror cinema, a foregone conclusion. How, then, did such tremendous potential so perfectly derail itself, to crash miserably into mediocrity and unfulfilled promise?  The answer to that burning question can be answered in one word: Script.  ""From Hell"" is the beautiful flesh of gorgeous--often breathtaking--visuals, hung on the decayed skeleton of a rickety story that seems to have been thought out with all the care and craftiness of a grocery list.  Indeed, ""From Hell"" is much like an enumeration of items that appear to have been checked off one by one, included for the sake of pretentious display, that never form any sort of cohesiveness.  This story is simply an overwrought, underdeveloped series of set-pieces that trades suspense for graphic violence, characterization for idiosyncrasy, and narrative for sensationalism.  I was thoroughly disappointed--as well as shocked--by the way the Hughes brothers neglected to provide this film with complete, logical, and interconnected scenes that would propel the story and give the viewer a sense that the events taking place on screen were a cumulative progression of action.  Ignored were the basic principles of storytelling such as building tension, arc, climax, resolution, and, especially, denouement.  Yes, these elements were present in a deconstructed form, but never were they explored or executed with any proficiency or insight.  Johnny Depp, I will concede, gave a suitably terse performance as the drug-addled Inspector Frederick Abberline, the main character through whose eyes the audience vicariously experiences the very real horror of the unfolding events.  Depp's accent was undeniably credible and his character's growing realizations believably portrayed.  Ian Holm's performance was, in my opinion, absolutely crucial to the success of the story, yet I do not feel that he accurately captured the essence of his character--often resorting to melodrama when restraint would have served the proceedings much more effectively.  Robbie Coltrane's character was a generic sidekick that could have been played by any number of contemporary actors, his contribution to the story completely forgettable.  However, I found the supporting portrayals of the doomed prostitutes to be well-done in comparison.  Which brings me to Heather Graham.  With an obviously ersatz British accent and a palette of blank emotions on her colorless face, her performance fell completely flat, reducing an essential character within the story to a two-dimensional caricature.  Though the acting was, on the whole, a mixed bag, let us now rejoice in what is perhaps some of the most extraordinary production design and cinematography of any film of 2001. ""From Hell"" is an absolutely gorgeous film ... from the exacting authenticity of the smallest period details, to the blood red sky hovering over the silhouetted peaks of an almost Medieval London (though filmed in Prague), to the echoing click-clack of horse-drawn carriages over the cobblestone thoroughfares, to the faithfully-reproduced historical costumes, nary an image was overlooked in building this dark, foreboding universe from the ground up.  I was consistently impressed, amazed, and delighted by the powerful imagery presented on screen, and found the entire film to be visually faultless.  Unfortunately, those lavish images fail to breathe life into the meandering story they strive to support.  Of note, is the film's graphic violence.  Though I believe it would have been exquisite had the story developed the suspense, urgency, and tension inherent in the subject matter, I will allow that the brutality of the killings in this movie is appropriately diabolic and filmed in an exceedingly stylized fashion.  It was necessary that the murders be disturbing, and, without a doubt, the Hughes brothers accomplished this task.  That said, I now must assert that the story's lack of historical accuracy in regards to the actual events of 1888 is among its major undoings.  Had the movie's creators adhered to the cold, harsh facts of the case and kept the revisionist fiction to a minimum, the overall story would have benefited tremendously, and may have, as a result, partially overcome some of its other deficiencies.  As it is, the ending of this movie is not only a profound disappointment, but also ignores important historical details.  ""From Hell"" is not a worthless film by any stretch of the imagination, but given its cachet and pedigree, it never realizes its tremendous potential.  For me, there is nothing more distressing than watching what could have been ground-breaking cinema relegated to just another wasted effort.",From Hell
302,GabrielX,Fantastic!,9,12 September 2001,"This is an amazing adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore. They managed to keep the story pretty much intact, as well as the style and pacing of the book. I was repeatedly amazed at how much of the book got into the movie, which I was expecting to be similar in name and subject matter only.There is one major difference between novel and the movie: in the novel, you know exactly who Jack is pretty much from the start, as well as the reasons he has for the murders. In the movie they flip it around to make it more of a mystery (and this is an appropriate change for a movie version).The crux of this change is that if you've not read the graphic novel, DON'T --  not until you've seen the movie. It gives away too much, and will reduce your enjoyment of the movie.(in case you're wondering, I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival's Gala Premiere, which is why I've seen it and you haven't! :-) )",From Hell

I especially liked the stylized shooting of the first murder - the flashes of the knife in the night. Very striking!What I did not like was what nearly everyone else mentioned: 1) Heather Graham - that red hair - sheesh! Even my dye jobs don't look that bad! And don't get me started on the accents - ech! And how nice that her character seems to be the only streetwalker who doesn't actually sleep with anyone?

Who'd listen to a druggy cop in any era?I did enjoy the commendable attention to detail to the Londoners and the background scenery. I could get into the feel of turn of the century London life the longer I watched the movie. Some scenes were humorous - like poor people having to sleep sitting up (and tied up) instead of sleeping in beds. Side note - the women couldn't find enough money to pay the gang but they found enough to bury their friend? Unlikely.The photography is what makes this film worth watching.

311,SteveMadcow,"""FROM HELL is a dark, compelling horror film... that will stay in your mind for days after watching.",9,2 December 2001,"I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack the Ripper, but surprisingly this was my first film based on the story. From Hell is an outstanding mystery and a dark, moody film. This is the type of film that sticks in your mind days after seeing it. You'll have the image of old Whitechaple in your head. You'll have the terrific murder scenes stuck in your head, but most of all you'll have the image of Jack the Ripper in your head. From Hell will disturb you. It might scare you, and it might even bore you (action fans will not enjoy this film). From Hell is certainly not for everyone, but it certainly was for me.Johnny Depp is fantastic. He is one of my favorite actors, and certainly delivers the goods in From Hell. His performance is perfect, and one of his bests yet. Heather Graham also does a fine job in From Hell. I was surprised with her performance. I'll admit, when I heard she was going to be in the film, I was worried. I mean who doesn't get worried when they find out the same actress who was in Austin Powers 2 is going to be in a Jack the Ripper film. But she did surprise me, although I still think she could have done better.The Hughes brothers direct this film with such style. The use of colors in the film is beautiful, as is the use of lighting. The camera angles are crazy, and the film turns out a beauty. Trevor Jones' score is great (As a matter of fact, I'm listening to it now), and fits the film perfectly. The music is eerie, creepy, and scary. It's flawless.The murder mystery is also great. It keeps you guessing the whole way through (I was not successful in guessing who Jack was), and when the killer is revealed, it all makes sense. And let me tell you, From Hell is violent! Although not as gory as I expected it to be, it'll still make you cringe (that throat slash!). A lot of the violence takes place off screen, which lets your imagination run wild, and mine did just that(My head was filled with tons of gory images).A lot of people call From Hell boring. I can see how they think that, but I disagree completely with that. Sure the film is slow moving, but how fast can a murder mystery movie be? I didn't get bored with the film at all... I was completely absorbed in the film. Another problem people found with this film was the love story, which I have to agree with. Had the love story been more developed, the ending would have been much more depressing, as we would have felt for the characters more (This could be what kept the film from an A+ rating).As I said before From Hell is great. It is my 3rd favorite film of the year, and my second favorite horror film (this year). It's a dark, compelling film, that is NOT FUN! There is no comic relief, it's all horror. Had it been a little more scary, and had the love story been more developed this film would be an A+. I highly recommend fans stay away, because you'll hate it.this film to fans of Jack the Ripper, and horror fans with patience. ActionFrom Hell: 9.5/10, A",From Hell

313,pateimann,"""Sleepy Hollow""-Syndrome",4,27 April 2002,"I had serious problems trying to enjoy this movie as it obviously suffers from ""Sleepy Hollow Syndrome"" (SHS). I'll try to explain what I mean: The most important fact that made me dislike this Hollywood production was the more than clumsily written script.... simply put: it was LAME. Throughout the whole 2 hours I did not give a damn about what would happen to the characters or who the killer really was. Just as in ""SH"", none of the characters were able to draw the viewer's attention for more than 5 minutes. And, also a trademark of the SHS, the ending was completely unsatisfying since it made the impression as if it were hastily put together only to reveal that the murderer ***SPOILER*** was someone that you didn't give s***t about at all. ***end of SPOILER*** Well, I would still prefer SH over this bore of a movie any day. I haven't read any of the graphic novels this film is supposedly based on but if the storyline therein is as dull as what the viewer is offered here, then I doubt it would have ever been adapted for the silver screen. The plot has many holes that were seemingly just put in there to make the whole thing longer (115 minutes!!! there was enough plot for about 60).***SPOILERS AHEAD*** Why is this whole drug-addiction-vision thing so important anyway?!! It doesn't add to the suspense and the sequences aren't even interesting to watch when you're ON drugs.... I think that says a lot. What meaning or possible plot relevancy is there behind the odd lesbian relationship between some of the whores?!? I DID NOT GET IT! If anyone did, then please take the time to explain it to me!! I'd really appreciate it: ;) Why Oh Why did it have to end like this?!!! It's the ending that I had been expecting since the first 30 minutes or so!!! I knew who he was all along!!! That's not what a thriller is supposed to be like! I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHO JTR WAS!!!! At least it shouldn't be someone like the killer portrayed in ""From Hell"".Well what else is there to say? The pathetic acting (with the cheesiest part delivered by good ol' Heather G.) was not helped by the poor accents.... and usually I'm very generous when it comes to accents. The whole drama thing was about as involving as an episode of ""Denver Clan"" and Johnny D. couldn't convince me that he really wanted to make a good movie. I like many of Johnny Depp's works (especially Dead Man and Fear And Loathing... ;-) ) but I believe that he should've just skipped this one (and a few others, mind you).Ok, so to sum it up: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It may have some (very little) gore but it's not enough to keep slasher-fans interested. There's no historical correctness either, so anyone interested in the Jack the Ripper story will be very disappointed as well. And there isn't enough original plot, almost no good acting and only fairly impressive camerawork.... so it won't be a treat for any of you moviemaniacs out there either.

This writer can think of one at present, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Be as it may, though differences are stark, these two events are both ignoble, made much more so, by the complicity of authorities, in both the progress towards their culmination and the cover-up of evidence, even to the extent of the murder of witnesses. Again, the ramifications go much further, even deep within the social fabric. For they touch upon the use of secrecy to hide misdeed and secret societies to commit them. The movie, From Hell is excellent, venturing into areas of high probability to weave a likely scenario with the established facts at hand, making sense of the puzzling anomalies so carefully avoided historically. So well does it succeed, we might wonder when the JFK assassination will be visited in similar fashion. The significance becomes imperative when society's own prerogatives are becoming more and more constrained to the privileged few.Excellent use of casting talent, the best job I've seen Depp perform, sets and camera work exquisitely utilized.

317,No-Explanation,"Rose from hell, halfway to heaven!",3,24 April 2011,"Review Four: From HellA five out of ten is by no means bad, From Hell isn't filmed badly, nor has it bad characterization, writing or acting. The special effects are average, too. Everything is just average in this film. It's not memorable, nor does leave ones mind instantly. From Hell is the definition of average, and with that it's not easy to say the film is recommended. The Gothic scape's are visually appealing, and much as one would expect. With the addition of Johnny Depp, one could easily think it was an early, toned down Tim Burton film, albeit not quite as absurd, fun or well directed. Released in 2001, the film has aged well over the last 10 years. One may be surprised it is that old.Yes, essentially this story of Jack The Ripper is a dramatized retelling, and all the better for it. Finding myself almost falling asleep throughout some scenes (when not even tired), the pacing isn't quite the best, either. Some scenes are unnecessary, some are over-drawn and some of the more exciting scenes aren't long enough.What was a fine film, however, has an ending so largely disappointing. This, again, isn't due to a script, nor the acting. it is purely from the directing style. It's, in text, satisfying ending, but it's just poorly executed. Possibly the issue with this film is that it takes itself 100% seriously, attempting to surprise with answers an audience is already familiar with. Essentially it spends so long building questions (and giving away the answers far too soon) that it detracts from the experience.For those a fan of the Jack The Ripper tale; this is a 5 out of 10 film, it's far from the best and you've seen it all before. Still, with it's own charm it is worth viewing. For those expecting a 'who did it' thriller, you'll leave severely disappointed with a 3/10. Anyone hoping for anything more akin to the Sherlock Holmes (2010) style model, loaded with dark humor, acting and a thrilling narrative, this film is far from it.A SOLID 5 OUT OF 10. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it, but for $5 when no other options are out there, grab it for a rent. Buying it isn't advised, as it doesn't seem to hold up as a repeat viewing material.",From Hell
318,edm-the_red,Mixed Feelings...,7,1 November 2013,"I'm pretty much a fan of Johnny Depp, as I usually appreciate his performance regardless of my ultimate opinion of the movie itself. Sleepy Hollow was a masterful re-envisioning of the classic story of Ichabod Crane, featuring a nice blend of mystery & horror. From Hell seemed like a natural extension of this character archetype, with a loosely-based historical inspiration, adding weight to the horrific scenarios that it depicts. With that in mind, I decided to check it out.There are many things that are done right in this movie, number one being the atmosphere. London is gray, rainy, & dark, and its desperate citizens reflect this foreboding setting well. The women whore themselves out for an extra cent, while the men retain control through intimidation & violence. Racial tensions, corrupt officials, and secret societies complicate the picture, and the actors in their elaborate costumes capture the unrest perfectly. As the film is a work of historical fiction, it takes liberties in the portrayal of certain events/facts, but only for the purpose of increasing the dramatic potential of the plot. In fact, these little deviations in historical accuracy felt very creative, and mostly fit in with the ambiguous nature of one the most infamous unsolved mysteries.The faults, while noticeable, are not disqualifying. The characters are played well, despite being mostly unremarkable to begin with. Depp's Inspector Abberline is likable, though his behavior is inconsistent. As an opium addict, he seems content to waste away his life in an altered state, yet jumps into action without hesitation, and utterly dedicates himself to risk life and limb tracking down a vicious serial killer & sifting through the lies that keep him so elusive. This also serves to make his relationship with Heather Graham, as the female lead, seem slightly artificial. The visionary, opium-induced haze that enables him to keep pace with the killer was an interesting touch, but wasn't utilized to its full potential, in my opinion. Also, the killer's character is not developed enough, and so comes across as ""cartoonishly"" scary, lacking in realism.Ultimately, this is a tense thriller that will captivate your attention, with a unique interpretation of the Jack the Ripper mythos.",From Hell

As its release date neared, though, and details of the film began to leak out, I became distressed by the broad changes the film's writers had made to Moore's original story, apparently with the consent of the Hugheses. Moore's story is not a mystery; neither, of course, is it a documentary of the case. He admits the novel is a work of fiction and has said that his choice for the identity of the Ripper is most unlikely. The Ripper case, its drama, and its continuing fascination was a hook on which to hang a social commentary -- and this, along with much of the historical research Moore and Campbell put into the book -- is what is missing from the Hughes Brothers' movie. The brothers are working with some very talented people these days, and they've made a very good-looking an good-sounding film, but at its heart, it's empty. Pretty as the cinematography is, talented as most of the actors are, ""From Hell"" is dull. It hasn't the thrills to qualify as a decent thriller, the chills to make a satisfying horror movie, the emotionally involving characters to draw us into a human drama. ""From Hell"" is a mess, and you'd do well to spend your money elsewhere.",From Hell

325,Mick Slowey,I know what you did at the end of the 19th Century,1,12 June 2002,"Johnny Depp plays Inspector Aberline, a cockney drug addict with psychic powers and a nice line in meaningful stares.  His task here is to catch a cunning murderer, going by the moniker `Jack The Ripper', who is disemboweling the local cockney prostitutes.From the opening scenes, where the whores are portrayed as `unfortunates' with a heart of gold and the gangsters are played as snarling, scar-faced sociopaths, I had my suspicions this wasn't going my particular cup of tea. Subtle? Not a word that springs to mind. The character development was heavy handed, bordering on downright stereotypical. Aberline is given a wife who has died in child birth, therefore he feels alone. Robby Coltrane spouts poetry, therefore he is wise. Mary Kelly has a picture of herself as a child to show that she wasn't always a whore.  Big broad strokes.Additionally, the supporting cast. (Sir Charles Warren, Dr. Ferral, Kidney and his Special Branch hoodlums) where left high and dry with hackneyed dialogue and slender, under-developed roles.The plot development on the other hand was acceptable, though derivative. A series of vicious murders with one potential victim being singled out for development right from the start. A romantic interlude. It even includes the old chestnut where the lovable whores' leave the relative safety of their lodgings one by one (after being warned to stay of the streets!) and are subsequently slashed. Nothing you haven't seen in the Scream movies. However, there is average development in between this that lifts the story slightly. An interesting conspiracy theory is included and the conclusion was a little less conventional, so I suppose that's something.The thing that particularly annoyed me was the style of the movie. When I heard that it was filmed in Prague I was expecting beautiful architecture, atmospheric back streets. No... A lot of the scenes looked although they had been filmed on a sound stage, whose sets were not particularly impressive. Now and again CGI shots depicted `Old London Town' in all its computerized glory. The directors used shoddy effects for the flashbacks and the premonitions. Time-lapse was used unnecessarily.Sound effects during the murder scenes sounded like someone was dueling with a cutlass, rather than eviscerating someone.  I'm sure my organs wouldn't clink and chink if someone went at them with a knife. I'd suggest a trip to the Modern Classics section in the video store for the Hughes brothers too see how it should be done.If you approach this film expecting something other than an average teen slasher movie set in the Victorian era, I think you will be disappointed.

Well I rented it and from the very beginning I was rooting for this film but didn't expect much, and 10 minutes into the film, I knew I was watching a brilliant movie. At first I tried to find flaws, but became so engrossed in the story that I soon just allowed myself to enjoy it. As far as the accents, they may not have been true cockney, but I often have have trouble understanding the real thing! I rented Snatch which seemed funny during the trailers but after 5 minutes the accents drove me buggers!!! I found the acting delightful, with excellent and believable performers. The movie was so visually stimulating that I had to watch it several times just to capture all the nuances of the extra's! I noticed a lot of people criticized the story line, the direction etc. Don't people go to the movies to be entertained anymore? Or does everybody now seek higher education. I was very impressed that the Hughes brothers known for their ""hood"" movies successfully directed an all ""White period piece"" proving that the world is really getting smaller and more familiar. This movie is a triumph on so many levels. Who cares that the theory the movie was based on is in my opinion, one of the least likely. But boy what a great story.

But aside from these two, overall the film was a bit dull with plot holes and un-settled questions everywhere and it was also the very first time I have not been totally convinced by Johnny Depp in a film. The whole film felt like it was about to step into a higher gear but regretfully never found it, even towards the end.  There have already been more intriguing `conspiracy' Ripper films and TV adaptions, so to see these very gifted film makers turn in something so empty was a bitter disappointment.",From Hell

(yes thats right, buildings do exist that are more than 100 years old!)I love Johnny Depp's diversity as an actor, but he really hasn't done himself any favours by starring in a film like this.

I loved the way that all of Johnny Depp's dreams and visions were shot. The murder scenes were original, i liked the little blips of images instead of long, drawn out shots. i didn't really like the ending, it left too much undone and was pretty confusing.

I mean, hey, this is a JACK THE RIPPER story! A *mystery* unsolved since the 1880s ... Visually the film is great, the performances are great either but somehow I expected more, more, more ... I don't know what. More suspense? More dark alleyways and shadows? More hints instead of explanations? More mystery for the mind to digest? But this film gave me no puzzle, no riddles to solve, no heated discussions at the end about some details that just can't be explained ... But then again it was good fun to watch, it just shouldn't have been so clear and stylised and ... simple. Maybe I knew too much about the story beforehand.---MAJOR SPOILER! DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE FILM!--- You can't expect a film to be true to the facts but anybody who is interested in the real facts knows that the theory about Dr Gull being Jack the Ripper doesn't hold up (I was surprised to see that Donald Rubelow, author of a great book on the real Jack, was involved in the making of the film if you believe the credits--he must have told the Hughes that the theory was nonsense).",From Hell

This movie brought so many of those instances to horrible and demonic light. I'm impressed that the Hughes Brothers jumped out of their usual genre of film to make such an incredibly evil and wonderfully dark movie. They remained so true to the graphic novel and true to the historical era it was based in. I saw an interview with the Bros. about this  they truly saw it was more of a period piece and less of a horror film. Nice angle. If you've seen and enjoyed this movie and/or read the graphic novel, pick up a copy of the novel The Alienist, by Caleb Carr.I'm a bit of a Jack the Ripper buff and I have to say that a great deal of the random facts and evidence that surrounded the case were in the movie (and the graphic novel). Those that weren't are wonderful adaptations and worked perfectly in the movie. The acting was excellent - Johnny Depp is becoming a wonderful actor... a far cry from his 21 Jump Street days.

The 'character' of characters (if you know what I mean) was a bit of a surprise to me. In other words, they did a very good job in keeping the suspense! The creative 'techniques' implemented in the movie (you'll see what I mean :) ) were very cool! I have to comment on the technical aspects (as they are incredibly important to any and every movie) - excellent! The camera work was fantastic, the special effects, and the music.....well, in the viewing of this movie at the theater I went to we had a bit of a ""disturbance"" in more than one way while watching - the audio stopped working on the film for some reason in the middle for a couple minutes, yet they continued to show the video, but *chills* they played NSYNC music to replace the actual audio blahhhh! The actual part of the movie that I saw, however, receives some of my highest praise - I've always enjoyed the original story of the movie and loved their take on it, but there's almost always room for improvement and the ending for me.....it just didn't add to the movie what it could have.",From Hell

He has not the""physique du role"" for playing an addicted middle age inspector in the 19th century. How could I say, he looks too healthy !! Also Heather Graham is definitively too pretty to play a 19th century street whore. The best thing in this movie is the atmosphere that only a city like Prague can give for a 19th century large city reconstruction. It really looks like you're living for a couple of hours in those days. The mixing between history and romance is very well crafted and acting is quite good. The bitter ending, so uncommon in an american movie, is unexpected and therefore appreciated.

344,tombrazelton,A gritty and violent thriller,8,30 October 2001,"From Hell is a gritty and violent thriller revolving around the famed Jack the Ripper murders. The clandestine plot as to who the Ripper actually is probably far removed from the real case, but within the universe this film establishes it fits like a glove. You really don't have any idea who it could be until the last 15 minutes. And none of the red herrings feel like the filmmakers are just pulling your chain.As always, Depp delivers a great character in the mumbling, opium addicted, hallucinating Detective Abberdine. Heather Gramm is mere window dressing as his hooker-girlfriend, but far less annoying here than in most of her performances.The real star of From Hell however has to be the scenery. 19th century London is depicted so convincingly in it's grime and depravity, you'll marvel at its sheer ugliness.

However, if you know a little of Jack the Ripper's history then you are not going to be surprised by to much in the film.

I have to admit Graham's performance was the low point of the movie but Johnny Depp, Ian Holm, and Robbie Coltrane? Fabulous actors. Over all, the accents weren't too bad- Depp's serviceable, Graham's annoying. And I really enjoyed watching Depp ""chasing the dragon"" because his psychic abilities were not as horribly cliché as they could have been. The bits about the stonemasons were very interesting as well.My favorite part was the ending. I had expected the typical: Boy saves girl, boy solves crime, boy shags girl and Bob's your uncle! But the ending surprised me, pleasantly. It was sad and uncomfortable- I loved every moment of it.For a night of soft-core-gore, From Hell is a good choice.

Everything about this movie gelled wonderfully, from the tightly knit story based on the graphic novel of the same name, to the beautiful cinematography (the image of the blood red skies over London is not easily forgotten), to the acting was pitch perfect for the film.  The acting especially was a pleasant surprise, as Heather Graham gave a fine performance despite normally having the acting range of stucco. Johnny Depp basically resumed his part from Sleepy Hollow, but added to it nicely to create a much more realistic character.  All in all, right behind Memento, From Hell is the finest film you'll see in the 12 month quality dry spell that has been 2001.  A solid 8 1/2 out of 10.",From Hell

I was afraid it might be a retread of his SLEEPY HOLLOW character, but it wasn't.All the acting was top rate, except for Heather Graham.I don't know if this was a ""studio"" decision or the Hughes Bros. decision to cast Ms. Graham in this film, but whomever's decision it was, it was a mistake.  Graham is gorgeous, which is a problem.  She looked nothing like a 19th century, poor London whore.  All the other prostitutes were fat, ugly and had brown teeth - except for Graham who was her gorgeous self with dyed red hair.  I don't think they even had that color hair in London at that time.  It sounds like I'm picking on her look too much, but it was incredibly distracting throughout the film and constantly ""took me out of the film.""  Her performance was passable, but far from up to par with Depp, Holm & the rest.

The acting is all around excellent with several English actors familiar from Masterpiece Theater.  Johnny Depp and Heather Graham do well with British Cockney accents. The movie is entertaining and has a plot or storyline that is literate. I would like to see more movies like this.

As somebody that's been somewhat morbidly obsessed with Jack the Ripper, I had high hopes that the Hughes brothers would deliver a riveting and original film on the murders.  And with Johnny Depp in it, who has picked so many good art house flicks in the past, my hopes were even higher.  Sadly to say, my hopes were dashed almost from the outset.  There was nothing new to the story, there was nothing that drew me in and if anything I kept wondering while in the midst of watching the film, ""Why did the directors even make this movie?""

I bet you'll know why by the end of it. I'd recommend it to anyone with a strong stomach and and a fancy for Johnny Depp. Personally, that's the only movie type I can truly get into. They keep you guessing until the very end, so even during boring parts of those movies, you're still tightly clasping your chair, wondering in suspense what's going to happen next.

This film is a dark one, much like another Depp movie Sleepy Hollow. In my opinion movie was a bit too hard to follow even though the plot itself isn't very complicated. Robbie Coltrane also succeeds to be in good shape in this one. But in general the stage is set for Depp and other performances tend go just in a side. The visual presentation of this movie is also interesting and exciting, although being quite dark, as said. But if you have seen a lot of movies like I, this one really doesn't offer anything new. The ones who liked Sleepy Hollow or The Ninth Gate will probably like this also. I liked both, but because I had seen them before watching this I was quite ready what to expect.

(Prince Albert, Catholic girl, child, Freemasons etc.) I don't know anything about the comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell; but I would love to know what they say their sources are.Apart from the ending (far too hollywood-esque), the events behind this story are all included in Mr Knight's investigations.

Johnny Depp does very well as the detective investigating the case and persisting in trying to solve it, despite the corrupt forces and people getting in his way.

357,lordstarkiller-16760,FROM HELL,7,24 November 2019,"First of all, it is worth mentioning the skillfully written original source in the form of a graphic novel, which served as the basis for the drama of the film in question. The creators of the picture should thank all the persons involved in the writing of the graphic novel, depicting an unusually charming and horrible story of brutal murders, further complicated investigations and secret semi-mystical conspiracies. All this, not without changes, and with varying success, was transferred to the screen, people, as can be assumed after watching the film, interested not only in the practical success of their work, but also in the artistic value of their work.
All the gestures in the film, as if the gestures of heroes or gestures expressed by filmmakers in the methods of visualization of the story, are extremely conditional, but they are filled with magnificent elegance of visual media, the stylistic solution of which brightly reflects the genre of the picture and the gloomy tone of the history as a whole.
Nevertheless, not all the scenes and dialogues in the film are able to retain the necessary attention, because of the obvious, purely informational nature of such moments, which represent a form of necessary evil, in the form of mandatory points for the further development of the dramaturgical component of the unfolding events, in this sad history, without which the already fragile integrity of the line of the plot, runs the risk of inevitably falling apart.
Separately, I would like to note the inspiring charisma of the Sergeant, whose interaction with the main character, performed in a restrained ironic manner, deservedly draws attention to himself, but, importantly, does not pull him over, but only complements the image of the latter and, in all senses, helps him.",From Hell

Ok well a lot.  Thinking that they would be another african-american set of directors bent on exploiting situations that are kind of unique to the african-american public, this movie has crossed over in all senses of the word.  And this was a welcomed change.  The movie was refreshing in a grotesque kind of way, the images and camera work was completely dark and delightful.  The story line was impeccably unique, seeing how all the previous ripper movies tended to focus on either the victims or the rippers point of view, and to add to that a conspiracy, possibly from the queen using an elite organization to protect her kingdom, definitely put a twist on the already engrossing tale.  Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, and Robbie Coltranes performances were shining, as was all the cast. The movie actually made you feel you were there.  I actually think I caught a buzz watching Inspector Abberline chase the dragon.  All and all I think the film was excellent, and it just goes to show that excellence is possible when someone completely steps over their boundaries.  My complaints....well a couple....the ""bodies"" of the victims could have been made to look more real.

I really enjoyed the plot twists and suggestions as to the identity of the famed serial killer ""Jack the Ripper"", no one has ever known the true identity of the man/monster. Though I will not reveal the suggested identity of the Ripper and in turn ruin the mystique of the film, I will say that for people who really enjoy murder mystery films, this is definitely for you. There is love & blood, encased in suspense, what could make for a more interesting piece of film?{END}***",From Hell

370,lcantoni,Not very good (mild spoilers),4,27 March 2003,"The actual Ripper events make a pretty exciting mystery in themselves, so why play with historical facts?  This film is so full of deliberate inaccuracies and unintended anachronisms that they become distracting, and the alterations do nothing to advance the story.  I didn't mind the Freemason theme - though it's part of an old and improbable theory, it is dramatically effective - but I thoroughly disliked making Inspector Abberline (who in real life was a much-decorated and respectably married cop of 45 in 1888) 20 years younger, a drug addict, and the lover of one of the women concerned in the case.  Indeed, that last touch tended to drag the film's pace down to a crawl.  As for the performances, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Holm, and the great Ian Richardson stole the show, but Johnny Depp and Heather Graham were just cardboard characters, flawed action hero and flawed damsel in distress, and I honestly didn't care what happened to them.  One excellent touch:  the sound of the metal coach steps being let down, like knives clanking against each other.  The murderer's fantasy during the last murder was also well done.  Other than that, a rather lame account.",From Hell
371,lce333,Better Than I Was Led To Believe,8,9 August 2003,"Having only seen this movie after hearing critics trash it for 2 years, I was surprised by how much I liked it.  I was expecting to be impressed with Depp's performance, and I wasn't disappointed, but I was also impressed by the execution of the story and the attention to detail by the directors. I haven't read the graphic novel (I plan to) but from what I heard about the deviations from it made for the movie, I think they were done to good effect.  I think adding the death of Abberline's wife and baby, and his opium addiction, made his character that much more compelling, as a flawed and unhappy man who nevertheless forces himself to pursue justice.  The opium and absinthe seem to be a natural response to the burden of clairvoyance that he must bear.  The re-creation of the lower underbelly of Victorian London was well done, I thought.  Not too squalid as to be distracting, but definitely not romanticized.  Altogether, a very solid movie.",From Hell
372,Lady_Legolas,"Review of From Hell, WARNING: contains spoilers!",7,12 March 2004,"From Hell is a great film; it has a cast of sensational actors and really brings to life the legend of jack the ripper. Johnny Depp plays Fred Abberline, an opium addicted police inspector, while Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly. The two work well together and the romantic twist adds a nice touch to the movie. However, some of the other 'unfortunates' can seem a little over-the-top sometimes.If you're not in to blood and guts the film is still enjoyable to watch as you don't see very much, but if you are there are plenty of clever sound effects to help your imagination! However, there is a lot of the old 'jump out of the dark' effect in this, so rather than being really scary its more a case of constantly jumping out of you skin.One of the best things about the film is the amazing sets and costumes that really bring to life Victorian London, and the way that the camera moves around in the dark alleys to make you feel like a part of the film. credit for that has to go to the set designers; Jana Chovancova and David Baxa, and to the costume illustrator Richard Gray, as well as all of the rest of the crew who done such a fine job on the movie.The part of jack the ripper is well played and if you like a film that keeps you guessing then this is one for you! I'm a sucker for happy endings so this film loses point on that feature, because even though jack the ripper is caught & punished, i would have liked the inspector to follow Mary Kelly back to her home and raise baby Alice together,but that would have been too much of a soppy ending for a horror film.over all i would give From Hell a 9/10, and i recommend that you go and watch it to see just what a good film it is!",From Hell
373,Nachum,Very Good,8,29 October 2001,"(Very small possibility of a spoiler)Overall, a very good movie. Excellent writing, acting, directing, and, especially, the sets all came together well. One very good point, from the point of view of someone who's followed the Ripper for a while and toured the sites of the murders- the movie does *not* butcher history (no pun intended). With the exception of the quasi-supernatural bits (which are integral to the plot but don't affect the ""history"") and the eventual solution (no one knows the real answer, of course), it's all as it happened.

376,aumfc,Very good; great detail.,9,30 October 2001,"I really believe that viewing a ""making of"" for a film can enhance the enjoyment of the actual movie.  This is definitely one of those cases.  The movie, without knowing anything at all about the history, is very well done. If you like Depp films (Sleepy Hollow, Blow, etc.), you will like this one. It reminds me a lot of Sleepy Hollow if done by the Hughes Bros.  It's dark and violent, obviously, with the conditions in the 'ghetto' of London in the late 1800's really done up well.  As I said before, though, if you know some of the history and see the making of afterward (I saw the one on HBO) it really enhances the experience.  The best thing about the movie is the level of detail.  Most of the sets where built from scratch using photos and writings from the period.  When you see the movie, you'll realize just how big these sets had to be.  Quite impressive for this day and age.  All of the killings were portrayed using crime scene analysis and details about how they were done, where they were done and even the position the bodies were found in!  Of course, since this is an unsolved crime, there had to be liberties taken with the plot line but I think it was still done very well and could possibly accurate as well.  The acting was not the best ever but it did serve it's purpose, it was believable.  Overall I'd give the movie a 7.5/10 before seeing the making of special and a 9/10 after.",From Hell

Murder scenes as purportedly committed by The Ripper were somewhat gruesome, but after all, isn't that what happened? Still, I would follow the age limit rating due to scenes of violence and some of sexual connotation as well as drug use. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the clairvoyant/police inspector/opium addict was well-played and convincing. Supporting cast, (especially actress who portrayed Mary Kelly) was also well-chosen.

The royal theory, the masonic conspiracy theory, and the two killer theory are all shown here, and none of them are very convincing. A very entertaining and frightening movie could have been made on the facts alone.  Hollywood of course is allowed to put their own ""dramatic"" spin on real life events, but what ""From Hell"" brings is the biggest fairy tale possible.  The movie plot alone without involving ""Jack the Ripper"" would have been a better idea.  The directors also seemed to want to throw in the real facts about the case quickly, so that they could make room for the fictional aspects of the events.

383,wretchedpyro,A Stylish and Suspenseful Look at the World of Jack the Ripper,8,10 November 2001,"The world of Jack the Ripper is a dreadful place.  London of 1888 is grimy, gloomy, and labyrinthine, and the skies are tinted the color of blood. This London is a desolate place, and From Hell doesn't succeed merely as a thriller, but also as an astonishing glimpse of ugly, polluted, and overpopulated London after the initial boom of the Industrial Revolution. From Hell makes an outstanding point by demonstrating the declining morale of the public during the reign of prudish Queen Victoria.  The use of trains is an especially great thing; at least two of the murders take place while a locomotive can be heard in the background.Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp: Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) is the detective put in charge of the case.  Along with a deductive mind and a loyal partner (Robbie Coltrane: Goldeneye), Abberline is able to see the murders actually occur while under the influence of opium, his drug of choice.  These dream sequences are probably the most poignant and powerful scenes within the entire movie.  While unraveling a vast conspiracy involving the throne and the Freemasons, he becomes acquainted with the only good-looking prostitute in London, Mary Kelly (Heather Graham: Bowfinger, Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me), who inevitably becomes the center of an entirely unnecessary romance.What From Hell fails in is becoming too obsessed with the identity of the infamous killer.  While the first hour of the film sculpt the anti-industrialist themes and build up a suspenseful thriller, the last half of the movie turns into a predictable, if slightly above-average, murder mystery.  Suspense has built up a considerable amount by the third act, and the easiest route is taken when the elaborate scheme is clumsily unveiled by just a small series of dialogues, which leads to an undeservedly short and simple resolution.  If only the finale had lived up to its preceding acts and had the filmmakers not have had such an obsessive devotion to unveiling the killer, then From Hell could receive a full-fledged recommendation, and would have undoubtedly would have become known as a masterpiece of the thriller genre.  It's a shame it just doesn't live up to its own potential.

384,aidan_morgan,It hurts to think about this one,5,21 October 2001,"After watching half an hour or so of From Hell I felt as if the Hughes Brothers had strapped me down and performed some impromptu butchery on my brain.  As soon as I saw that opening shot of London's blood-red skyline (after a promising into that does for opium what Pulp Fiction did for heroin) I knew that this movie was going to be an unrestrained and unsubtle Hollywood dream of Victorian England.What is it about pre-twentieth century Britain that makes American filmmakers froth at the mouth and scream ""More blood! More filters!  More simple-minded exposition!""?  1992's Dracula at least had the excuse of basing its extravagant visuals on an equally lurid literary source, but From Hell's betters are, well, better than that.  I loved the original graphic novel for its black and white images that looked like swiftly executed but amazingly skilful sketches.  There was a subtlety of artifice that made the story all the more terrifying.So much for that.  The Hughes Brothers pour on every daft trick they can think of to conceal the fact that a) they have no feeling for late-1800s London, except as a Cockney version of inner-city Washington; and b) the screenwriters Hayes and Yglesias didn't know to condense the wealth of information and paranoid plot detail from the original into a working screenplay.  The pacing of From Hell is, as another commentator noticed, bizarre.  The first act, before Depp's character begins to take an interest in the movie, is unbelievable clunky and awkward.  The early moments seem drained of drama, as if they were tentative character improvisations in the first days of shooting rather than actual scripted scenes.  Characters step into frame to announce their plot significance and motivation and then step off again; if they're not played by Depp, Graham, or Holm, they're onscreen only to talk desperately or menacingly, show cleavage or knives, and kill or be killed.In case you're wondering, Heather Graham does not make a convincing Victorian prostitute.  After five seconds of screen time, even before she opened her mouth to attempt a Cockney accent, it is immediately apparent that a casting mistake has been made.  The real horror of From Hell comes from the suspense between Graham's scenes; you never know when she's going to pop up next and whine out a line about being hungry and impoverished. It is like being lied to by someone who has stolen your jacket and wears it in front of you; you admire the audacity but you are not convinced.The rest of the cast stands up to the overbearing directorial style with a campy resistance that produces some enjoyment.  I liked Depp's thuggish London accent, which has him saying things like ""Fank you"" and ""I fink there's somefing going on here"".  Ian Holm jumps around in the birdbath of his own cultural folklore and makes all the other performances seem amateurish.This movie, like a whole schwack of others, is a kind of film soup: part inner-city police procedural, part period piece, part slasher flick.  Other generic elements surface occasionally, but the Hughes Brothers wield such a furious spoon that it's hard to see the ingredients.  The conflicting requirements of genre sometimes produce anachronisms and unlikelihoods that strain the limits of credibility.  Heather Graham's character Mary Kelly is an Irish peasant who left at the age of eight to take up an exciting career in Whitechapel as a prostitute, but she can read and write - and has beautiful penmanship.  Say what you like about the institution of schools in Victorian England; it's still ridiculous.More ridiculous still are scenes in which Kelly suggests that she left Ireland and came to England because ""it seemed too small a place to live the rest of my life in"".  Never mind the crushing poverty, the potato blight, and the stigma of being an Irish Catholic in Victorian England.  It's all about that restless feeling that makes you want to leave your dead-end town, get on that ferry and take your hopes and dreams to glitzy glamorous Whitechapel.  And all at the age of eight, apparently.  I can only hope that I misheard something.  A bit more forgiveable (but no less stupid) is the uncomfortable resemblance between the London constabulary of 1888 and the NYPD circa 1988.  Inspector Abberline, when he's not having opium-induced visions, acts like a renegade American cop with an infusion of British politeness.  As the movie progresses, examinations of the corpses begin to sound more and more like the autopsy scenes from ""Silence of the Lambs"".The really anachronistic, or perhaps historically blind, elements of From Hell would involve giving away the whodunnit modular unit of the film, so you'll have to see it yourself. But don't.  Unless you like blood (there's lots), or Johnny Depp's cheekbones (does this man never age?), or if you enjoy the spectator sport of watching lesser-known British actors steal scene after scene from hapless American stars.  There's also some really really bad continuity errors.  Jason Flemyng plays a tormented coachman with one of his ears partially lopped off.  Watch for the scene in the film that explains his torments and explores his psyche. It consists almost entirely of a close-up on his face. Take a look at his ears.  Then leave the theatre: tell people you've just come from hell.",From Hell
385,daelili,Disappointing,3,24 October 2001,"I found this movie so disappointing that it inspired me to write this, my first review. The only genre appropriate for this movie is Horror because of possible shock factor at the type of murders committed. However, considering the repetitive nature of this film, only the first murder could really be considered ""shocking"".I find myself shying away from horror movies because I scare easy, however, even I did not find this movie scary. There was no suspense. The movie was merely disgusting. You could not even really classify it as ""gore"" because the repulsive part was more the idea of the murders rather than what was shown.The ""romance"" part of this movie was laughable. Heather Graham's character was poorly developed, and I was not convinced that Inspector Abberline would fall in love with her. I suppose the fact that Mary Kelly didn't once solicit men, despite being a whore, like all the other women was an attempt to soften her character and make their love more believable. It didn't work on me.This movie was extremely predictable - you knew what was going to happen next throughout the entire film.

Nevertheless, as a classical dark whodunnit thriller, this is definitely a must-see movie. For those who like this type of movies, of course.Heather Graham is a little bit too sophisticated for an East Side ho, but life can be tough sometimes. She gives the movie an incredible balance in the sense that the movie's darkness is absolutely tolerable and appealing. Johnny Depp is definitely one great actor, although I'm not so sure about his English accent.

He was playing a police Inspector, but instead of having a middle or upper class accent like his peers, superiors and underlings, Johnny sported a lower-class street accent like the prostitutes had.

It was obvious that the filmmakers had paid plenty of attention to other movies set in that time and place, but they had no feel whatsoever for how it might actually have been.

400,SofiaPurple,Surprisingly bad,4,21 January 2003,"OK, I like Johnny Depp, I love suspense movies and don't mind a little blood. But this film left me disappointed. Let me just comment a few things:1) Johnnys accent. On the dvd version, the directors gave compliments to the fact that he was able to switch from Irish to Cockney to posh English, and they were so impressed that they didn't think he needed much coaching. What can you do but laugh. They're American, I guess everything with an intrusive R sounds English to them. Let the specialists be the judge of whether Johnny's accent was British or not, and let him get the help he really needs. I'm a native Swede, and I thought it was was terrible. And that says a lot. (I especially hated his mock Sean Connery thing, pronouncing ""s"" as ""sh"".)2) London in the 1800s was dirty and smelly. Why are the streets so clean, and especially: why is Heather so squeaky clean? And another comment: Heather's character is so obviously much more pretty than the other prostitutes. This could be credible, if only someone would have commented upon it. At least her friends should have teased her about it  or something. Or she would be making more money than the others. It doesn't make sense.3) Johnny is supposed to be investigating a murder. I understand that the methods are much more refined today, but come on... Most of the time he just wanders around looking sad, alternatively surprised.4) When I heard the directors' comments on the film, I lost whatever respect I may have had for them. Laughing, one of them said he'd cast one of the girls because she had such darn sexy collarbones. Duh. And all of you looking for nudity: on the dvd version, one scene which was cut out can be seen, where a very well shaped and beautiful female body lowers herself into a bath. I agree, she looks terrific. So why was she cut out? The answer is obvious. She was only there as a decoration, had nothing to do with the film, and I found that fact a bit offensive. Needless to say, the directors disagreed with the test audience, who wanted her out. Are we talking Hollywood directors or teenage boys here, everybody??",From Hell
401,Palantir_of_baraddur,The best thriller I've seen in long time,9,19 January 2005,"Set in 1988 in whitechappel, London, this film follows the story of Jack the Ripper, and the detective that is assigned to the case, inspector Albiline (johnny Depp). The whole film is incredibly stylistic, using a mix of filming techniques, including dreams, hallucinations and the more common types. The sound track is great, and the plot is good and easy to understand, even a child could understand this film! The length is fine, some think it is too long but if it had been shorter then they would have had to miss stuff out, which is what can spoil a good film (think Harry potter).This film is shot in a similar style to Baz Luhrmann's moulin rouge, its is full of color, with great detail given to the style and color of each scene. The only think that really lets this film down is the end credits, they are done in a style that makes a film look dated even 4 years after it is made. The actors try their best, depp is great, as is Coltrane, who plays depps sidekick. Heather Graham is average, but the accent isn't fooling anyone! A great film with a great twist, a lovely insight into Victorian London, whilst the style it was shot in will keep film students going for years! Definitely worth seeing.",From Hell
402,tracy-128,Excellent film drawing on both fact and popular fiction about Jack the Ripper,10,15 February 2005,"As an avid readers of Jack the Ripper history, to say that both my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised by this film is putting mildly.The film cleverly combines both the facts about Jack the Ripper and the popular fiction that now makes up the staple Jack history.The acting is great, the cast is brilliant, Ian Holme and Jonny Depp are superb. The sets are dark and atmospheric, some of the cinematography is stunning.We watched this with my husband, not a Jack historian who had been put off by the title but he enjoyed the film as much as we did.So the moral of this review - Don't let the title put you off, it is not a horror movie more of a period detective/drama, well worth taking the time to watch.",From Hell
403,greg-624,Johnny Depp as a Cockney!,7,8 April 2005,"The rather scarily-titled 'From Hell' is an entertaining piece of Hollywood hokum about Jack the Ripper. Without giving too much away, it offers a new spin on old material (although seasoned 'Ripperologists' will find little to surprise them). Johnny Depp works surprisingly well as cockney detective Inspector Abberline, and the cast is uniformly strong - although some might think that casting Heather Graham as an Irish/Cockney prostitute is pushing credibility a bit! Still, this is an enjoyable romp and there's no need to let realism get in the way of the fun. Frankly a lot of the characters seem to have stepped straight out of 'Oliver', but it hardly seems to matter. That said, the atmosphere is genuinely chilling at times, and it's interestingly filmed in a style reminiscent of comic books (the script was based on a graphic novel). Not one to take too seriously, but fun fodder for a wet Wednesday evening with the curtains drawn.",From Hell
404,Grimlyn04,a movie about a detective pursuing Jack the ripper,10,26 May 2005,"This movie has a very well written dialog that is good and sticks to the plot in good time. One thing I greatly liked about this movie is the ending. It isn't a happy movie so it sticks to it's ""guns"" and has a not happy ending (to an existent). Johnny Depp does an outstanding job in this movie and does a very good job of portraying his character. this role adds to the large list of varying roles he has successfully done. Another good aspect of this movie is the cinematography. It is dark, quick and suspenseful, all of which, are good for this movie. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys horror/suspense movies or people (like myself) who have interest in Jack the Ripper.",From Hell
405,sunil-07,Worst movie,3,8 November 2014,"Too bad ending. Nonsense crap movie. The actor could have returned to that woman village after some years. Or could have visited her occasionally. It was difficult to understand the logic of the movie. The name of movie shows there would be some horror, but there was no bit of horror.Abberline deduces that Freemason influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter Albert Sickert (Mark Dexter)'s forbidden Catholic marriage to Crook (Joanna Page), who bore his legitimate daughter Alice. Sickert is actually Prince Edward, grandson of reigning Queen Victoria (Liz Moscrop), and therefore Alice is heiress to the British throne. Gull himself is a Freemason and his increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated, mind.",From Hell

407,dariandemierre,Avoid like Jack the Ripper,3,21 December 2020,"There's artistic licence, and there's make-believe. This production picked out a dozen facts and then passed it over to the fiction team to create their own Jack the Ripper parody. Unfortunately, this team seems never to have stepped foot in London and relied on their postcard knowledge of the city to include the likes of Big Ben and St Pauls Cathedral as background images for Whitechapel. So too have they taken endless liberties to misrepresent the historical facts concerning real people in order to establish some semblance of a plot.Despite all these flaws and errors, the result is still a fictional failure. I was hard-pressed to keep myself awake and endure the childish script, weak direction and poor acting (Depp). I do love the era and nuances of East End, so for that reason alone I raise my rating to 3 stars out of 10.",From Hell

Stunning visuals good looking.
Johnny depp superb in a roll just made for him in the years pre jack swallow... Wich in the first movie he was a delight. Dark tale of England's and my favorits serial killer(after Jerffey Dahmer) Jack the Ripper. The comic is good too I was told... But I don't read... Waste of time I can't spend in the pub having a beer or two.... More more",From Hell
409,windsurfingchick89,Though a bit gruesome it was still an excellent film.,8,16 August 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Though it was a tad gruesome for my taste the cinematography itself made up for it. I loved the cast. I'm always amused when you can take actors who have played characters such as Captain Jack Sparrow, Bilbo Baggins, Hagrid, and the older daughter from Lost in Space and create an excellent thriller. I would call it a thriller and not a horror. To me a thriller will always be a horror with a plot. From Hell had a good plot that kept you intrigued and guessing the whole way through. Of course the fact that Johnny Depp is one of the most attractive men on earth always helps bump the ratings. This movie is great to watch with a group of friends. Only those with queasy stomachs should refrain from this movie. Almost everyone else is guaranteed to like it.",From Hell
410,shadowsgirl_2005,"""Much Scholarship Hath Made Them Mad.""",8,14 January 2006,"This is a fairly good film and Johnny Depp is, as always, good in it. What got me to write any comment was some of the ""supposed"" goofs as reported here. The main one is about the surgeon ""Ferral"" being called ""Doctor"". We are informed that a surgeon would have then and would be now called ""Mister"" not ""Doctor"" in England. This is almost but not quiet correct. In PROPER British usage he WOULD, as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, be called Mister. In general and lay usage, however, he is very likely to be called ""Doctor"" even though he isn't one. Witness Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES (1901) in which James Mortimer, MRCS is referred to as DOCTOR Mortimer pretty much throughout even though he himself tells Holmes ""Mister, sir, Mister, a humble MRCS."" This craze for finding so-called goofs gets out of hand, sometimes, and, as in this case, sometimes the goofs aren't true goofs at all.",From Hell
