0,MartinHafer,"Exceptionally original but very, very disturbing",8,1 June 2007,"In many ways this is a very unpleasant and highly disturbing film, but it is also extremely original and very watchable. Jody Foster plays a 13 year-old who lives on her own but manages to successfully pretend that she lives with her father. Again and again, when adults visit, she manages to convince most of them that he's alive and well though it's painfully obvious to the viewer that she's alone. Now this certainly is not enough to make a movie, so there are some very creepy subplots involving a horribly nosy and cruel real estate agent (Alexis Smith) and her pedophile son (Martin Sheen in a very difficult role). Both are such awful people that you really feel sorry for Foster and most will probably root for her to kill them! In particular, Sheen is super-sickening to watch, as he knows something is amiss and surmises that Foster is all alone--making her the perfect sexual abuse victim. His groping her and killing her pet hamster before her eyes (in a very realistic scene) will no doubt cause many viewers to turn off the film because it is so intense and disturbing. While these didn't bother me too much, a nude scene late in the movie did, as it appeared as if young Foster was naked. The idea of a 13 year-old naked on screen is very disconcerting, though according to IMDb the scene was actually done by Foster's older sister (whew). Regardless, showing so much skin really wasn't necessary and just seemed exploitational--making this the only negative in the film. Aside from that, the movie was surprisingly exciting and managed to make a simple story idea compelling and credible.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
1,bkoganbing,Another Bad Seed,6,24 March 2021,"In her woman/child period of Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver Jodie Foster turned out
this curious film. The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane is a 70s version of The Bad Seed. She wants to live alone though given her circumstances I doubt anyone in a responsible position of authority will let her. People just go missing
around her including parents.Acting honors in this film go to Martin Sheen the son of Foster's family's landlady Alexis Smith. As it is designed to do, Sheen's performance will make your skin crawl,Foster reputedly does not like the finished product. It definitely is in the
middle rung at best in her body of work.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
2,Leofwine_draca,Oddball psychological thriller hits the mark,6,7 April 2018,"The 1970s is a decade chock-full of interesting and long-forgotten American and Canadian movies, many of them made for television, some not. THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE is such a film, an astonishing tour-de-force for a youthful Jodie Foster, cementing her shocking role in TAXI DRIVER. She plays a weird and friendless 13-year-old who lives alone in a house; there's some mystery surrounding the fate of her parents which comes to light as the story goes on. This is set in a single room for the most part and feels like it was adapted from a play, although it's actually taken from a novel. It's a psychological thriller which remains thoroughly interesting thanks to strong writing and interesting, unique characters. Martin Sheen plays a completely sleazy character and there are a few shocking moments here and there, but for the most part this is slow-paced and almost surreal at times. It's certainly a film that leaves an impression and is ripe for re-discovery by modern viewers.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
3,SnoopyStyle,love the actors but...,5,22 July 2015,"It's Halloween in Wells Harbor, Maine. The creepy landlady's son Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen) comes to check on and creep on the 13 year old Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster). It's her birthday and she's suppose to be with her British poet father in the rented secluded seaside home. Except her father is nowhere to be seen. The next day, nosy landlady Cora Hallet (Alexis Smith) comes to invite her father to a party but Rynn is aggressively evasive. Officer Miglioriti gives her a ride home but he doesn't get to meet her father either. Cora returns to challenge Rynn but accidentally kills herself in the cellar. Rynn tries to get rid of Cora and convinces young infatuated passerby Mario to help her.I love all the actors in this. Sheen is surprisingly good creeping on young Foster. She's always great as a child actor. However it's too aggressive in hinting at the father's death. The reveal does make a twist on it but the twist is not nearly big enough. It just doesn't have enough change in the tone of the movie. The final tea is also problematic. It doesn't make sense that she doesn't put it in both tea cups. I can see this being a compelling thriller. This doesn't have enough surprises.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
4,claudio_carvalho,Low-Budget Cult Gem,9,18 April 2019,"In a little seaside town, the thirteen year-old Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster) is celebrating her birthday alone on a Halloween night since her father is not at home. They have arrived from England recently and leased the house for three years from Mrs. Cora Hallet (Alexis Smith). Out of the blue, Mrs. Hallet´s pervert son Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen) visits Rynn and sexually harasses her. Then his mother visits also the house and asks for Rynn´s father. The girl tells that he travelled to New York. Mrs. Hallet tells that she needs her jelly glasses that are stored in the cellar and Rynn asks the impolite woman to go. Later she returns and opens the cellar door despite Rynn´s refusal. However, she has an accident with the support of the cellar door that hits her head and she dies. Rynn tries to get rid of Mrs. Hallet´s car to hide the evidence that she had visited her, but she has trouble to start the car and the aspirant magician Mario Podesta (Scott Jacoby) helps her. Rynn immediately trust Mario and discloses her secret to him. What is Rynn´s secret?""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is a low-budget cult gem with Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen. The plot is original, creepy and highly enjoyable. Rynn Jacobs is a young teenager trained by her father to behave like an adult and it is impressive the intelligence and cold blood of this character. Martin Sheen performs a scary pervert. Their performances give credibility to their characters. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Menina do Outro Lado da Rua"" (""The Girl from the Other Side of the Street"")",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
5,gavin6942,Is Jodie Foster an Adult Trapped in a Kid's Body?,7,19 July 2012,"The first thing that strikes me about this is how adult Jodie Foster's character is. At only 13, she talks like an adult and handles adult situations. Granted, on some occasions she is awkward and does not always think consequences through. But, hey, neither do some adults. One could argue that Foster had adult characteristics in ""Taxi Driver"", too. Did she reach adulthood at 12? Anyway, not a bad movie. Some have called it horror, and I am not sure if it really fits in with that genre. I can see it -- death, a stalker trying to get in the house, a girl who has little contact with the outside world... but does it ever fully cross from drama to horror? Hard to say.Martin Sheen also appears as the pedophile who seems all too comfortable walking into houses without being invited. Judging his acting is difficult. I mean, he did a really great job convincing me that he was a child rapist. But it is hard to really congratulate someone for that... nice work being a creeper.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
6,lee_eisenberg,I also like crosswords...,8,1 November 2018,"Jodie Foster has been one of the most renowned actresses for almost forty years, not to mention one of the most versatile. Pretty much all cinephiles know about her roles in ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". But one role with which you might not be familiar is the 1976 thriller ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"". Part indictment of hebephilia, part reminder that children aren't as immature as you might think, this is an impressive one.Obviously, a few of the scenes look inappropriate; I get the feeling that one scene in particular couldn't get on screen nowadays. Sometimes called a horror movie, it's more psychological thriller, slowly building up Foster's character and revealing her disturbing tendencies. And I recommend it. The protagonist's innocent appearance hides a manipulative, sociopathic side. Mind you, there are some parts that will shock you (and I don't mean anything dealing with death). Perfect movie to watch on Halloween (as I did).",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
7,Woodyanders,Jodie Foster shines in this exceptional psychological thriller,9,5 January 2007,"Feisty, fiercely self-reliant 13-year-old Rynn Jacobs (a stand-out early lead performance by the remarkable Jodie Foster) lives all by herself in a swanky house on the remote rural outskirts of a sleepy coastal village. Following the death of her father, Rynn has convinced everyone in town that dear dad's away on business, but will be returning soon. Rynn befriends and falls in love with nice, but gimpy teen magician Mario Podesta (winningly played by Scott Jacobs of ""Bad Ronald"" fame). When her snoopy landlady Ms. Hallet (a perfectly irritating Alexis Smith) and her creepy pedophile son Frank (a splendidly slimy portrayal by Martin Sheen) threaten to ruin her adult-free self-contained existence, Rynn resorts to drastic violent measures in order to retain her independence. Tautly directed with laudable taste, restraint and aptitude by Nicholas Gessner, with a clever, witty script by Laird Koenig (adapting his novel), an elegant score by Christian Gaubert, handsome cinematography by Rene Verzier, and first-rate acting from a top-drawer cast (Mort Shuman is especially fine as a friendly sheriff), this exceptionally eerie and absorbing thriller covers all the bases with striking deftness. What truly makes this film special and noteworthy is the sweet, touching and sensitive romance at the heart of the story about unconditional love between two highly atypical and appealing adolescents. Moreover, the final confrontation between Rynn and Frank is both chilling and disturbing. An excellent picture that's absolutely essential viewing for both fans of well-done thrillers and aficionados of Jodie Foster alike.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
8,rmax304823,"Little, yes, but clever too.",8,17 October 2008,"I'm about to spill most of the beans here so if you don't want to know what happens, read no farther. Jody Foster is Rynn, the little girl who lives down the lane in a spotless, New England cottage, with her reclusive poet father. Or so it seems. When a nosy landlady, Alexis Smith, looking mighty good, shows up and begins making pointed inquiries about dear old Dad, Foster allows a heavy trap door to bonk her on the head and put a permanent end to her queries. The body remains in the cellar, aging along with the wine and Foster's mother.There is, of course, no father upstairs sleeping, or working behind his locked bedroom door, or off somewhere tending to some affair. After home schooling his keen-minded little girl, he advises her never to allow others to dictate her decisions. Thereafter, he wades off into the surf, leaving behind a payment of three years' rent on the house and a sizable sum of cash for his daughter to dip into.But Jody Foster is too clever by half. She's got the brains and the cultivation of an adult. (We can tell because she loves Chopin and knows how to preserve dead bodies after poisoning them). But she has an emotional configuration that befits her shapely thirteen-year-old body. I mean, what the hell is she going to do when the rent is up, when the cash runs out? A little more substance in the frontal lobe wouldn't hurt.Martin Sheen, as Alexis Smith's son, could, I suppose, be categorized as the bad guy. He's had a slight run-in with the law over an encounter with a pre-teen earlier, but he is not a pedophiliac. There isn't a single scene showing him worshiping a foot. However we do see him torture Foster's gerbil with a lighted cigarette and then fling the tiny beast into the fireplace. He hits on Foster, and he says to the teen-aged boy whom Foster has befriended and confided in, Scott Jacoby as Mario Miglioriti, ""Hit the road, Wop."" Sheen discovers Foster's secret but the audience is likely to feel little sorrow at his passing as he finishes the cup of tea she's prepared for him and comments, ""Tastes like almonds."" I hope nobody gets this movie mixed up with a schlock fest like ""The Last House on the Left."" No blood here. No screams. Just the rather slow unfolding of a tense story with, I have to say, a flimsy premise. You can't get very far with a story of a young girl who wants to be left alone and murders people who ask too many questions.In the end, though, we must ask how many bodies can that wine cellar hold? There are other weaknesses in the script too. Her dear mother's body has been lying in the cellar for a month or so and when Mario asks about decomposition, Foster says, ""You can put stuff on them. I read about it in the library."" Well, the thing about preserving bodies has to do with putting something IN them, not just ON them. You don't have to be a mortician to know that. Any good taxidermist will fill you in.The performances, on the other hand, are all good. (They pretty much have to be. Almost everything takes place in one room.) A lot of the film's weight rests on the shoulders of Jody Foster. How is she? She's amazing. She was about twelve when this was shot (the same age as Lolita) and she never puts a foot wrong. Every line is believable. On top of that, she may only be in her teens, but she's criminally beautifully, and sexy too, enough to bring out the latent molester in any normal man. She's the kind of adolescent you'd like to dandle on your knee and subtly caress while discussing Nietzsche with her. Sorry, but that surely must have been something the film makers realized. Her ash blond hair is long and wavy and she wears bangs low across her forehead, turning her eyes a deeper blue. Her features are slightly fuller than they were to become, and she has a gap between her upper incisors that produces a slight whistle when she utters sibilants. She's endearing, brain and body both. Some kids seem to be born with the talent to lie well, as an actress and as a character. Foster's got it",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
9,ma-cortes,Outlandish drama about a lonely little girl excellently performed by a precocious Jodie Foster,6,24 November 2007,"The film concerns about a rare thirteen years old little girl(Jodie Foster: Bugsy Malone) and whose father is never at home . She receives various visits, an old woman(Alexis Smith) owner her rented house, a child molester(Martin Sheen), a patrolman(Schuman)and a young boy(Scott Jacoby) dressed as magician. Meantime, the young girl starring hides something in her cellar.This is an offbeat and intelligent drama-suspense with good performances, though some moments is slow moving. Based on a novel written and penned by the screenwriter Laird Koenig. Casting is really magnificent with sensational main actors and supporting cast. Jodie Foster as premature nubile is outstanding, the film belongs her period when played turbid characters such as ¨Taxi driver¨ and ¨Foxes¨, counterpoint her sweets characters such as,¨Tom Sawyer¨ and ¨Napoleon and Samantha¨. Martin Sheen is very fine as nasty children lover and the veteran Alexis Smith, famed actress who played with Errol Flynn, is excellent as distrusted proprietary. The movie displays a glimmer cinematography and nice soundtrack accompanied by classic music score by Shuman and piano concert by Chopin. The motion picture is professionally directed by Nicolas Gessner. He's a mediocre director, this one is his best movie, he directed to Ben Gazzara in ¨Quicker than the eye¨and to Charles Bronson in ¨Someone behind the door¨. The film will like to Jodie Foster fans.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
10,BA_Harrison,Jodie can take care of herself.,8,14 May 2014,"13-year old Rynn (Jodie Foster) supposedly shares a rented property with her poet father, but when curious locals request to meet the man of the household, they are quickly rebuffed, causing them to suspect that the girl is actually living alone. The idea of a pretty teenage girl on her lonesome proves way too tempting for local pervert Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen), who seizes the opportunity to make a move, but resourceful Rynn isn't quite as defenceless as she might seem.Jodie Foster's confident central performance in The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is absolutely mesmerising, the young star displaying all the signs of a future Oscar winner; Foster is ably supported by Martin Sheen as cold-hearted child-molester (and hamster killer) Frank, and Alexis Smith as Frank's nosey mother, whose curiosity leads to a sticky end in the cellar. A chilling character study, a tender romance, a macabre drama, a subtle horror: The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is all these and more.Only an unbelievably silly scene in which Rynn's friend Mario (Scott Jacoby) dons a rubber mask and pretends to be her father in order to fool his suspicious uncle (Mort Shuman) mars what is otherwise a very effective and surprisingly provocative little thriller.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
11,moonspinner55,"Eerie, provocative thriller...",9,6 September 2005,"New to a seaside village, a young girl and her poet father seem to live an isolated existence, until curious neighbors get nosy and always seem to find the fiercely independent girl on her own... Unwisely advertised as a horror movie, ""Little Girl"" is instead an amazing psychological thriller, rich with atmosphere and featuring a lead performance by Jodie Foster that is deft and incredibly assured. The sequence where Foster, troubled by the sickness of a friend, eats alone at a hamburger counter (actually, she hasn't touched her food), then wanders down the street studded with marquee lights has to be one of the most beautiful Foster moments put on film. Well-directed and written, the movie is very cognizant of the way adults condescend to or ignore children, and allows leading character Rynn to use her intelligence as a tool--and maybe a weapon as well. Those looking for slasher-type jolts may be disappointed with the picture; it's more subtle than something like ""Halloween"", creating suspense out of tension and mood instead of outré violence. Foster was at a personal peak at this time in the movies, having just completed ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Bugsy Malone"". This isn't the harrowing character study of ""Taxi Driver"", but it is a remarkable portrait of a terribly uncommon child dealing with very grown-up issues. Due out on DVD in October 2005.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
12,paul_haakonsen,"Slow story, but nicely acted...",5,9 January 2016,"Given this movie is from 1976 then it is still a movie that can be watched today. Why? Well, because it does have a story with solid contents, although it was unfathomably slow paced.What works out for ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" was the acting. A young Jodie Foster really carried the movie phenomenally, and she held her own against screen mammoth Martin Sheen. And speaking of Martin Sheen, then he really pulled off that sly, perverted role he was portraying, and this has to be the most sleazy role I have ever seen him in.While the story is slow paced, it was also rather predictable. You know what is going on right from the beginning, or at least it takes very little to figure it out.Just to quickly summarize the story, then it is about a 13 year old girl living in a big house, allegedly with her father, although no one has ever seen him. As the locals start to come snooping around, the girl attempts to shun them off by driving them away.If you enjoy a movie that is driven by a well-written, albeit slow paced, story, and if you enjoy a good old Classic, then ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" might be worth spending an hour and a half on.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
13,dbdumonteil,Get out of my house!,7,20 May 2005,"Nicolas Gessner is very special director:an Hungarian,he made most of his career in France where he is today virtually forgotten,although his sentimental series ""le château des oliviers"" was a smash some fifteen years ago.After directing Mireille Darc in ""la blonde de Pekin"" which is pleasant but not very absorbing,he made his two best works in the seventies:""quelqu'un derrière la porte ""(1971) and ""little girl...."" These works have many similarities:both feature American stars ,Bronson and Perkins in the former,Foster and Sheen in the latter;both sometimes look like filmed stage production,although ""little girl"" was not,unlike ""quelqu'un ...' a play;and murders;and a mysterious character in both :Foster's and Bronson's ones.I would favor ""little girl"" over ""quelqu'un"" though.Part of the reason can be found in the fact that Foster was already a whizz kid and she carries the whole movie on her shoulders ,and it's not a small feat to make us forget the numerous plot holes.To think that at 15,she was already able to dub herself in French -like co-star Mort Shuman,who was enjoying a very successful career in France after writing for Elvis,Spector and many more-.Sheen is also impressive as a disturbing pedophile.In ""quelqu'un.."",Bronson was miscast and Perkins just gambled on his ""psycho "" prestige.A distant relative of Jack Clayton's ""our mother's house"" (1967),but not as haunting though.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
14,BandSAboutMovies,A perfect film,10,10 December 2019,"What kind of movie is this? Is it horror? A children's film? A coming of age story? A feminist or child's rights message film? Or is it as director Nicolas Gessner said, ""a teenage love story""?The American release of the film - which was rated PG and deleted the nude scene that Foster refused, with her older sister Connie acting as her body double - offers these words: ""She was only a little girl. She lived in a great big house...all alone. Where is her mother? Where is her father? Where are all the people who went to visit her? What is her unspeakable secret? Everyone who knows is dead.""If you need to put this in a neat box, the term I've been using for films like this - and others that we'll talk more about this week - is ""coming of age while the supernatural lurks around the corner.""Let's travel to the small town of Wells Harbor, Maine, where Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster) is celebrating her thirteenth birthday alone in the home she shares with her poet father. The son of her landlady, Frank Hallet (Martin Sheen), visits and is immediately sexually aggressive to her. Later, his mother visits and demands to see her father, who she claims is in New York City before taunting the older woman about her son. Then there's the cellar, which she's obsessed with seeing. Well, curiosity killed the cat. And it kills Cora Halley, too.The rest of the film involves Rynn hiding the body (and maybe even bodies), dealing with Frank and falling for Mario (Scott Jacoby, who of course was Bad Ronald), a young magician.It also features Mort Shuman as a police officer. Shuman was once the partner of Doc Pomus and wrote ""A Teenager in Love"", ""This Magic Moment"", ""Save The Last Dance For Me"" and ""Viva Las Vegas.""While this is one of Foster's least favorite films, I've always really loved it. That may be because she believed that one of the producers was crazy, as he wanted her to do have more nudes scenes. She also had a rough time filming the love scene.While rated PG, this movie exudes menace and nascent sexuality. It also has plenty of dark moments, like Frank killing Rynn's hamster. And then there's the fact that Rynn's father killed himself by drowning in the ocean before giving his daughter potassium cyanide so that she could kill her mother, then embalming her and placing her into that basement that interested the old landlady so much.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
15,Coventry,The Little Girl Who'll Creep the Hell out of you!,9,3 January 2007,"Since ages I wanted to see this film and it was worth every single nail that I've bitten off whilst waiting for the DVD to arrive at my place! If you're looking for a genuinely macabre thriller, like they could only make them in the lewd 70's, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is my number one recommendation! This movie is like a much darker (and un-comical) version of ""Home Alone"", with an extremely clever and independent teenage girl hiding from the outside world that she lives alone and keeps even darker secrets locked up in her cellar. Young Rynn and her father, a famous poet, moved from England to a quiet seaside town in the States where they're leasing a remote house for a period of three years. Nobody in town ever meets Rynn's father as he's always working in his study or resting up in his room. Various people, including the obnoxious landlady (Alexis Smith) and her perverted son (Martin Sheen) attempt to interfere with Rynn's life, but the eloquent young girl keeps them at a safe distance; with or without the help of a sickly local boy who she befriended. The script - adapted by Laird Koenig from his own novel - perhaps isn't always logical or plausible, but it's the grim atmosphere and brilliant dialogs that make this movie an absolutely compelling experience. And the outstanding acting performances too, of course. Everything you've read about Jodie Foster's performance is true. At age 14, she portrays one of the most powerful and convincing child-roles ever. Her cold stare and monotonous voice are disturbing as hell, but her intelligence and independence are admirable. Particularly the scenes when she's alone with Frank Hallet, a known child-molester, the young character's courage is deeply impressive. Although not featuring entire buckets or blood or shockingly explicit sequences, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is one of the most frightening films I've ever seen, mainly because it effectively portrays ordinary people as real threats. The Hallets, both mother and son, initially seem harmless, but they quickly turn out to be nosy and obtrusive perpetrators with mean intentions. The film is stylishly photographed and features many beautiful images of a secluded Canadian seaside area. Nicolas Gessner's direction is respectably slow-paced. This film is a definite must-see for all kind of audiences.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
16,michaelRokeefe,A young girl proves to be self-sufficient.,8,25 April 2012,"This is a psychological thriller starring Jodie Foster as a young girl, Jody Bryan, living alone in her father's house; all the while convincing everyone that her notable poet father is absent on a business trip to Paris, although actually he has died of cancer. Jody's landlord Mrs. Hallet(Alexis Smith)becomes suspicious of the girl always being alone. Mrs. Hallet,who is also on the school board, frowns on the self-taught girl not going to public school. Meanwhile Mrs. Hallet's pedophile son Frank(Martin Sheen)tries his best to have his way with the nubile Jody. The local law enforcer Mr. Miglioriti(Mort Shuman)comes to the house questioning the disappearance of Mrs. Hallet and in doing so really suspects the young girl is lying about her father. Before Frank Hallet can successfully rape Jody...he too will come up missing. The very self-sufficient little girl who lives down the lane will finally end up needing some help from a young boy near her own age played by Scott Jacoby. This movie may creep along a bit; and any suspense is fleeting. For some there is the highlight of the 14 year old Foster's brief nude scene. No doubt an atmospheric chiller and well worth watching.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
17,Doylenf,"Disturbing, with some dark themes and subtlety in the playing...",6,7 October 2006,"There's not too much to recommend here, except that JODIE FOSTER was always an interesting actress, even as a young girl, but the story could have been much more gripping and taut with suspense.She never seemed to play the wholesome types, and this is no exception. She's a bright thirteen year-old, living ostensibly with her poet father in a seaside house, very adult in her manners and interests.She doesn't like the snooping of others who ask too many questions about her quiet life in a house where her father is never seen. ALEXIS SMITH (her landlady) and MARTIN SHEEN (her lecherous son) are among those who do ask too many questions and threaten her isolated and very private existence. Like Miss Foster, their performances are just fine.All of this keeps the audience interested in finding out what has happened to her father--and what are the dark secrets she is hiding. There are a few unexpected plot twists, but most of the story is told in a very understated way in a style that is not likely to connect with today's audiences who want films with a faster pace.However, there is a certain subtlety to the proceedings and it does get under your skin if you let yourself fall under the spell of some very good acting. It seems like ideal material for Alfred Hitchcock, who, in this very same year, came up with his poorly received FAMILY PLOT. By comparison, this one rates more attention.For me, the highlight of the story came when Foster confronts her angry landlady, played in fine form by the still lovely Alexis Smith. Their tense confrontation is well staged and beautifully acted.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
18,preppy-3,The type of film Hollywood wouldn't touch today,8,4 June 2007,"13 year old Rynn (Jodie Foster) lives in a huge old house with her father on the outskirts of the ""village"" (I don't think the place is ever named). She has to deal with mean old Mrs. Hallet (Alexis Smith) who got them the house and her child molesting son Frank (Martin Sheen). Rynn also meets Mario (Scott Jacoby) a teenager around her age and falls in love. But why is it that nobody ever sees her father? And what exactly IS in that fruit cellar? SPOILERS!!! The plausibility here is tough to swallow--I find it very hard to believe that a 13 year old girl could keep up an entire house, pay off all the bills, get alcohol (HOW did she??) and NOBODY figures out what's going on! Still this movie works--if you can buy the premise. It's a slow (but never dull) psychological thriller. There's only a little blood and no sudden shocks like they have in horror films today. It's well-directed in a truly beautiful location. It has a good score too and has a very somber, quiet tone that does work on you. The acting is mostly good. Smith and Sheen are both obnoxiously slimy as the villains. Jacoby tries too hard to be cute and funny and quickly becomes annoying. As for Foster--I'm really torn. On one hand she says her lines with utter conviction--you believe every word. On the other hand she's totally emotionless--nothing ever shows on her face. That is explained (kind of) but just a little emotion would have helped.This movie has a PG rating but has some quick, casual female nudity by Foster (or her double). Today it might get an R rating considering it's made quite clear that she's having sex with Jacoby and Sheen's character wouldn't be quite as evil. Still--this wouldn't be done today. It's too quiet and challenges the audience to actually think. So, implausible plot aside, this is a creepy little thriller. I give it an 8.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
19,Bunuel1976,"THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE (Nicolas Gessner, 1976) ***",7,18 July 2007,"This is one odd little movie, a deft combination of the art-house with the “Grand Guignol” type of thriller – a character-driven mood-piece that’s undeniably gripping most of the way (it loses some momentum during the second half, when the narrative takes up the budding love story between its two young protagonists). Also, the wintry locations and the melancholy score complement the unfolding drama admirably.The five main actors are all excellent: Jodie Foster has one of the most difficult roles ever tackled by a child (which she carries with startling aplomb); Martin Sheen is equally surprising as a slimy paedophile; Alexis Smith is wonderful as the bitchy town bigwig – apart from being Sheen’s mother and Foster’s landlady (the confrontation scenes between the two strong-willed females are terrific); Mort Shuman is an Italian cop who befriends Foster (he also contributed to the soundtrack!); and Scott Jacoby is the latter’s nephew, a crippled young magician who becomes embroiled – rather willingly – in Foster’s scheming.While considerable tension is created throughout, there’s little actual violence here; nonetheless, the brief nude scene involving the under-age Foster is mildly shocking for a PG-rated film of the time. I’m somewhat ambivalent towards the ending, too: Foster is allowed to get away with murder (but, then, the 1970s were a cynical decade!); besides, Sheen’s comeuppance – in spite of its delicious twist – doesn’t quite carry the impact it should because we had already suspected her of pulling the same nasty trick on Jacoby.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

21,view_and_review,Jodie Foster Was Something Else,7,26 February 2021,"Jodie Foster was busy in 1976. She did ""Freaky Friday,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" and the topic of this review, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane."" Having now watched all three of these, it's hard to believe she was only thirteen to fourteen-years-old when these movies were filmed-she was that talented and, in this case, that nude.From the beginning of ""The Little Girl"" we know something was up with ""the little girl's"" father. She was evasive about her father's whereabouts to the town perv, Frank Hallet (Charlie Sheen), and to the property manager, Cora Hallet (Alexis Smith), but why is what we must know. It quickly becomes clear that Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster) was alone in her house and her father, who is oft-mentioned, was nowhere on the scene. Still, there wasn't the natural concern that one would have for an unaccompanied minor. It was like we all felt about Kevin when he was left ""home alone,"" we wanted to see what would happen. Rynn is so resourceful, intelligent, and brave that parents or no parents we want to see her left to thrive unmolested, and it seems like that will never happen in the little town she lives in. Between the property manager, the perv, and the police, Rynn has plenty of busy bodies snooping around. But it's going to take more than a few local yokels to break her stride and upset her plans.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

23,The_Void,"Intriguing, macabre and brilliantly acted - a must see film!",8,13 December 2005,"Wow, where has this little flick been? The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane is an intriguing mystery, an intense character portrait and a dark, brooding thriller all rolled into one rather odd little package - and on a personal note, I liked it a lot! The film has gained some notoriety (although not as much as it would have if it was more seen) for the scene involving a thirteen year old Jodie Foster undressing - but that never offsets the point of the film, and besides that; it's hardly like the scene has just been thrown in to satisfy the perverts in the audience. Furthermore, the most shocking scene in the film involves a hamster with no naked teenage girl present! Anyway, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is about a young girl, living down a quiet lane with her poet father. Only nobody has ever this man, and it isn't long before nosey neighbours - such as the perverted Frank Hallet and his enquiring, power mad mother comes sniffing round, eager to upset her life. She's not quick to let them know the truth, however, and along with her boyfriend; a crippled young magician from the neighbourhood, she is forced to take steps to preserve her independence.The most obvious theme running through the film stems from loneliness, and how being brought up on your own will ultimately leave you a different person to if things such as schools are allowed to take charge. This is interesting; as it preaches the idea of social conditioning makes up the person more than most like to admit. The film is often touted as being a horror, but this is incorrect. While the film does feature several macabre instances, and a foreboding and mysterious atmosphere that is present throughout the run time; there's very little in the way of actual horror. The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is much more of a drama-come-mystery than a horror film. The film is probably most notable for it's lead performance. Jodie Foster had already impressed in 1976 with her role in Martin Scorsese's hit film, Taxi Driver - but here she is far better. Despite her young age, Foster commands the screen and despite being a child, her maturity and acting talent shine through to make this a more complete performance than most actresses manage in a lifetime.On the whole, this film was once hard to come by; but with the new DVD currently doing the rounds, the film should be seen by everyone. The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane fits snugly alongside the rest of the classics of the seventies, and the fact that it has only just resurfaced is one of cinema's biggest injustices. Highly recommended viewing!",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
24,christopher-underwood,Made the same year she made Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone,8,17 March 2019,"Made the same year she made Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone, Jodie Foster had just turned thirteen when she made this. An astonishing performance especially considering she is on screen for most of the duration. Ably enough directed the movie often has the look of a TV movie and had originally been so intended. Only the wondrous green Bentley seemingly justifies my Blu-ray print but the film is so good, it is as well to see it as best you can. Martin Sheen is fine if worrying in his evident desire for the youngster and the near constant references as to him being a paedophile seem a little unnecessary.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
25,whpratt1,Great Jodie Foster Film,8,17 November 2008,"For some reason I missed viewing this film which held my interest from the very beginning to the end and I was amazed at the great acting of Jodie Foster. Jodie was 14 years of age making this film playing the role as Rynn who in the film was suppose to be 13 years of age. Rynn lives with her father in an old home which they leased for three years and she did not go to school, but taught herself at home along with her father's help. Martin Sheen, (Frank Hallet) plays the role as a married man with children but he likes little girls and even puts the make on poor little Rynn. It was nice seeing Alexis Smith, (Mrs. Hallet) who had a rather minor role but she was at one time a great movie star. There is some nudity, which is suppose to be Jodie Foster, but I have strong feelings these quick scenes were performed by a stand-in actress. You will never be able to figure out just how this film will end. Enjoy.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

The build up is slow and the plot is a little hard to follow with interest and much of the characters life and happenings appear to be in secret. In one of Jodie Foster's early roles (in fact this was the same year of her stardom role of ""Taxi Driver"")she is Rynn a young girl who lives in a seaside old resort house with her very reclusive father. It appears she's all alone or is she? Is something down in the basement? Her neighbors(note: Martin Sheen plays one of them) suspect that Rynn is dangerous and hiding secrets and they make appearances trying to set her free from this isolated world. However word of warning don't go down in the basement cellar.

27,lasttimeisaw,Ask Her No Questions And Nobody Dies.,7,8 March 2007,"Some girls are doomed to be great actresses, like Jodie Foster. She was only 13 when she was shooting this film. And one of the best children performances I've ever seen, especially for such a complex and mature role.The storyline is very tense and gradually discloses a quite creepy and scary situation. A lone girl who lives with her father whom hasn't been seen for quite a long time, then when other people try to contact her father, the little girl always uses different excuses such as his father do not want interruption while writing (btw, her father is a writer in the film), or he is just away at that moment. But suspicion has risen in any case,some people put their moves to find what on earth has happened especially after the mean landlady disappeared after she visited the girl. Including the landlady's lascivious, idle son, a kind policeman and a young crippled boy who was attracted by the little girl. Then the truth was exposed little by little which causes a lot of tension and surprise.I will not spoil the ending here but I think it's a film of good quality. The director handles the suspenseful atmosphere very well although the budget is very low and the scene was quite simple.Jodie Foster gives an impressive performance as this cool, mysterious and brave little girl and so is Martin Sheen, who is very convincing as the bad guy. Alexis Smith also gives a brief but intense work.One thing to complain, I feel a little bit unwell to watch Jodie has the graphic nude scenes, just as well she had a double to shoot them. I think the nude thing with the boy is quite useless, not work well for the script, only a kind of stunt to get some public notice for the film.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
28,gridoon,"All setup, no payoff.",6,23 January 2003,"Jodie Foster is indeed impressively good in this movie, and she is perhaps the only actress who could have pulled off such a challenging role at such a young age. However, the script is disappointing. It's the kind of story that keeps you watching by implying that many big revelations will be made, and when the revelations do arrive they prove to be less-than-shocking. There's only one moment in the film (when the seemingly vanished father appears) that it looks like there's gonna be a REAL SURPRISE, but that moment lasts only about 20 seconds, in which you have enough time to guess what is actually happening. Worth seeing only for Foster, and for her co-stars who are all very good, too.    (**)",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
29,lost-in-limbo,"This little girl can look after herself just fine, thank you.",9,24 June 2006,"Rynn Jacobs is a lonely, but well equipped 13-year old girl who lives with her poet father, while keeping a dark secret in the cellar. Although whenever somebody dropped by she would tell him or her that her father was too busy to greet his or her guests, or that he was out of town. But her life in solitaire is interrupted when she gets a visit from her snoopy landlady and her perverted son who takes a real shinning to Rynn. This is when Rynn goes to any lengths to keep this lifestyle with the help from a local crippled boy Mario, to herself.This noteworthy gem of small-scale, mystery-thriller incorporates a fascinating slow-drifting character study that has certain believability in its characterizations and manipulative suspense. The macabrely, lurid context of the film could have over-step the mark, but it keeps it mostly under-wrapped with it being more hinted, than aiming for anything really illustrative. But that in mind, it doesn't lose any of that unnerving effect that's spun out, because the confronting performances and crafty dialogues are extremely effective in underlining the disquieting horror that lurks within the film's make-up. What sweeps you along is that the script is lyrically dense and quite thoughtful, while it still generates psychological tension in certain scenes without needing to go out with a bang. There's nothing big or powerful about it, because it plays it cards close to its chest and grafts away with it's involving story and sedated handling. The compelling plot is incredibly well defined by touching on many different aspects that Foster's character encounters. These range from loneliness to her approach on life through an adult perspective and finally that of her estrange relationships with some of the town's folk. It's all about her finding her feet and living her life the way she wants to without the intrusion of others (the adults) enforcing their resolutions onto her because she's ""just"" a child. Life is what you make it and she's not going to play their game. It's just really hard to categorise this unique film (which, was originally intended to be a TV movie), because it goes down oh so many paths, but it's successful in gelling them together.Jodie Foster in the lead role makes the character her own by providing a maturely astute performance as the independent girl Rynn Jacobs. Her professionalism really does take hold in this picture and she does so with great control. Martin Sheen is equally as good and believable by playing his villainous character in a very subtle way, but still able to bring a creepy and vile presence to this predator Frank. Scott Jacoby is likable as Mario; Alexis Smith is great as the intrusively stern landlady Mrs. Hallet and Mort Shuman as the caring local officer gives a moving performance. What makes these performances so great is that they have vivid characters to feed off and shape.Since it was intended to be a TV movie it does feel and look like one, but none of that took away from the elegant looking production. You could tell it was low-key because most of the film did take place in or around Rynn's isolated house. The direction by Nicolas Gessner is carefully crafted and from the outset he paints a mysteriously brooding atmosphere. The simple layout of photography is crisp and beautifully demonstrated. While, the stirring score is quite a strange one with it's heavy handed approach, but it has some sort of a hypnotic trance because it likes to play around with the moody and quite edgy situations.This under-appreciated find of the 70's is a surprisingly focused and innovative treat that grips you from the very opening.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
30,bowmanblue,When Clarice was more like Hannibal?,8,11 March 2019,"I know I'm a little late to the party in terms of watching 'The Little Girl Who Lived Down the Lane,' as it was made back in the seventies and I've only just discovered it. Despite my love of films I'd never even heard of it and came across it quite by accident on an online streaming service. I didn't know what to expect, other than it had the (always great) Jodie Foster in it, plus a practically-unrecognisable (due to his youth) Martin Sheen (I guess he had to be young once, I've just never seen him looking like that!).Foster plays Rynn Jacobs - a 13-14 year old girl (age deliberately unclear for reasons you'll have to find out by watching the film!) who is wise beyond her years and yet never really comes across as smug or forced. In fact, despite her undisclosed wisdom, she actually comes across as quite vulnerable. She lives with her father, who is a workaholic poet and the pair of them have recently moved to a small town in America to escape city life. Some of the locals do wonder about the couple and subtly (and sometimes completely UNsubtly try to stick their noses into the pair's affairs. And, from this, we start to see more than we expect to.If ever a film cemented an actor's credentials that she was more than capable of carrying a film, even at a young age, then it was this one. This is Jodie Foster's film through and through. Martin Sheen is good (and creepier than I've ever seen him), but it's Foster who shines out. I would imagine that anyone who watched this film back when it was released must have realised that she was destined for mega-stardom.It's also a film where I can't really say too much about the plot for fear of giving away spoilers. You'll only get the one chance to watch it and not know how things are going to unfold. It's quite a 'straightforward' story, mainly taking place inside the family home - so much so in fact that I couldn't help but imagine how this could easily have been a stage play. There aren't that many characters to follow, but the story is simple (and when I say 'simple' I also mean different) which will make you want to know how things turn out.I guess, if I had to try and put this film in to a genre then I'd hedge my bets and say it was a 'drama-thriller.' The drama bit is easy to classify, but don't go expecting any fast-paced thrills here. There aren't any fancy special effects, major 'set-pieces' or anything else that may say 'big budget,' but don't let that put you off. It may be old and look a little a little dated by today's standards, but if you like carefully-crafted slow burning films which will make you wonder how they will end, definitely give this one a go. I can't believe it flew below my radar for so long.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

Rynn's resourcefulness is put to the test as several people try to find out what she might be hiding, including the snobby landlady and her sleazy son. This was a very intriguing film. It slowly creeps up on you and manages to get under your skin. It's a great psychological thriller with many great surprises. You know something isn't right with Rynn, but Jodie Foster manages to make you care about her plight anyways. Despite that she had obvious problems, I still empathized with her. That's talent! Martin Sheen is excellent as the scumbag. I hated him for who he was. He creeped me out on several occasions with his inappropriate behavior. Scott Jacoby is entertaining as the friend Mario.

Who, is not present at this time. Nosy neighbors, (Martin Sheen and Alexis Smith) wonders where is Rynn's father. Another person who is a policeman (Mort Shuman), who is rather curious as well checks on Rynn. He doesn't trust the Hallets. When Mrs. Hallet dropped by to get the jelly jars from Rynn, she demands to speak with the father. So when she goes into the cellar to get the rubber seals, she screams in terror, only to get herself killed by the heavy door. Later, she meets Mario(Scott Jacoby), who happens to be the policeman's nephew. At first, they have a small rift, but when he gets rid of Frank Hallet (Sheen) for killing Rynn's hamster, they ended up liking each other. Other than Frank's mother, Rynn's mother is in the cellar. Turns out that Rynn has poisoned her mother because she has been very abusive towards her. And her father carried himself off at the beach after he bought it for her. This girl may have been a minor, but she's adult enough to handle the world on her own. Eerily as it speaks, this movie was awesome.

A very pleasant surprise is the presence as an actor of Mort Shuman, who I adore as a musician (how many know that he wrote together with Doc Pomus ""Save the Last Dance for Me"", a very popular song first recorded in 1960 by The Drifters, with Ben E.

Mort Shuman(November 12, 1936 – November 2, 1991) was an American singer, pianist and songwriter, best known as co-writer of many 1960s rock and roll hits, including ""Viva Las Vegas"". He also wrote and sang many songs in French, such as ""Le Lac Majeur"", ""Allo Papa Tango Charlie"", ""Sha Mi Sha"", ""Un Eté de Porcelaine"", and ""Brooklyn by the Sea"" which became huge hits in France.

For me, Foster has always been one of those people that gets admired by other people. But there is something at once perturbing and yet irresistible about this pubescent adult interacting with people around her. Some are threats, some are well-intentionally condescending and I like to think that on some level we basically have a love story that one can actually take seriously.With a certain mystery to hold it together, the way the plot goes might not be what anyone would call masterful story telling and the whole thing feels a lot more like memoirs and disjointed episodes than a solid narrative.But there's so much personality in this quite singular experience and it's a rare and refreshing advocation for the emancipation of children.There's also a pair of jeans that look pretty good on the floor.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

37,drownnnsoda,Interesting Little Thriller.,7,28 December 2006,"""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" focuses on Rynn Jacobs (played by the brilliant Jodie Foster), a thirteen year old girl who lives in an old house a little outside of a small seaside town. The neighbors and townspeople are nosy, and always end up checking in on Rynn to find her all by herself, a very independent little girl. But where is her father? That is the question that everyone who visits the home has. Rynn has temporary excuses to her father's whereabouts, but soon Rynn has to resort to extremes - even murder - to hide a secret from the nosy people and the landlord who are invading her home and wanting to know too much information.More of a drama thriller than a horror movie (as the film may seem), ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" is an interesting psychological thriller that is held very well with Jodie Foster's excellent performance (as always). She shows off her acting abilities in everything I've seen her in, and even in this, which is her earlier work, she still shows a high amount of potential. It's no wonder she's become such a celebrated Hollywood actress, she's good at what she does. Martin Sheen, also playing a nosy neighbor in this film, is also very good in his role. I liked the idea of this film - an isolated and lonely little girl who seems to be possibly living alone, but hiding a secret as to why her father has mysteriously disappeared. But where is her father, and why isn't he there? The premise is intriguing so I thoroughly enjoyed the film. And the idea of such a young child resorting to murder is plain disturbing, even though it has been done a number of times, it's done very well here.But the real strong point of this film is what happens in the audience's point of view. We, just like the landlord and her son, and all of the other nosy people that are invading her home, don't know the secret behind why Rynn's father is gone either. The audience is put in the position of these characters, and it's a really fun experience to try and figure it out for ourselves.Overall, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" is a sometimes eerie and interesting thriller. It keeps the audience guessing along with it but holds onto our interest the entire time and doesn't fail with the storyline. Very well executed and very well acted, with a strong atmosphere to go along with it. Don't expect a gory slasher film though, because this is nothing even close to that. 7/10.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

Jodi Foster is very good as Rynn, a mysterious 13 year old who lives alone in a seaside town, somewhere off the coast of Massachusetts. Martin Sheen, as always, is excellent as a neighborhood creep, interested in Rynn, (he has some sort of criminal history against children).Scott Jacoby is her peer, trying to help her live alone, and stay in the house her father has provided, although her father and mother have both mysteriously disappeared.All in all an interesting theme, with some beautiful landscapes of the New England, and the beaches during winter. 8/10.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

A young, well-versed Jodie Foster plays the titular character, who inhabits a lonely house in the woods without any apparent parental supervision. She attracts the attention of the bitchy landlady, her pedophile son (a strong early performance by Martin Sheen), a local cop, and his mischievous son. While the film's central focus is the cover-up of a murder, it also carefully delves into the perceptions adults have of children (and vice versa), not to mention the shifting dynamics of relationships under extreme circumstances.

It's still worthwhile, mainly because of Foster. You really see a foretelling of her abilities as she grows into one of the greatest actresses of all times. Maybe Foster doesn't like this particular film, but she is definitely an actress on the rise here.Martin Sheen plays a really creepy, sadistic pedophile, but he'll get hid just desserts, now, won't he.

When he finds out about Rynn's murders he still remains best friends with her, even her lover, 'till the end. I actually read the book before viewing the film, the film follows the plot very closely. The Canadian small-town atmosphere was a great choice for the film, with the dark and dreary clouds and rain and charming houses. Martian Sheen pulled off the very convincing and disturbing role of Frank Hallet, the adult son of the landlady who is secretly a child molester.

If today's directors could create an atmosphere half as good as Nicholas Gessner a lot of chillers and horror films would be immeasurably better for it.The story, taken off a novel by Laird Koenig (who wrote the screenplay), delves deep into the dark psyche of humans. There are only a couple of characters who aren't hiding shadowy side. Even the little girl isn't as nice as she appears.Rynn Jacobs (Jodie Foster shows she was a great actress from a young age) and her father rent out a house on the outskirts of a Quebec small town. Though as time progresses her landlady and her son come to believe that something isn't quite right in the Jacobs household. It's this main mystery which drives the story and what Koenig does superbly is interweaving other peoples secrets into the tale. For example, it appears right from the first meeting, you would never trust your daughter around the Landlady's son, Frank Hallet. If frank is a deviant then what does that make his mother?Another strength of this film is the cast. The two who shine the most are Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen. Foster, even at this early stage of her career has a massive range of emotion and has no problem portraying them all through her character. Whereas, Sheen's character is a little less complicated. He is a man who is used to getting his way. He is manipulative and cunning. Unfortunately for Rynn, not only does he like young girls but is intelligent and driven enough to solve mysteries. Sheen nails the sheer sliminess of this character. Whenever he's on-screen there's a sense of unease that follows him. This is not a lovable man.Even though there's nothing too special about the direction Gessner is great at getting the emotions contained across to the audience. It might be because he had trust in his actors and actresses skill. Or it might be a slight camera angle. A pause too long on a certain shot that gets under the viewer's skin and into their minds. Like the continually live ending shot of Foster sat before the fire, her eye's starting to tear - you can see the raw emotion held within as the credits roll. There's an uneasiness, a sadness, a feeling of loss and being lost, all in that one long shot. I'm not sure what it is exactly but it works.This is one of those films that I recommend everybody to watch, especially if you like chillers, thrillers, and dark mysteries. This is a very good film.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
44,gizmomogwai,Close to greatness,9,18 August 2011,"Here's a movie I never heard of until last night; someone mentioned it as a great movie that not many people have seen. Coming out in the same year as Taxi Driver, Jodie Foster is about as good in this, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane (what a wordy title). I didn't find the movie entirely great, but much of it is impressive.The writing, acting and look of the film are good and the story was intriguing. Rynn (Foster) is only a 13-year-old girl and she seems to live in her house completely alone. She doesn't go to school. I was a little put off when Mario entered the film. I just couldn't buy this; Mario is a complete stranger, but he quickly plunges into some dark dealings and Rynn takes him into her world immediately. We never really find out Mario's psychology. Much of the film deals with Martin Sheen's character, a sexual predator and hamster murderer. He's good in this, with a character a world apart from President Bartlett.I had thought there was going to be a twist (Leonard Maltin hinted at one), but there wasn't one, really. She's got bodies in the basement, that was easy to guess. And Rynn poisoning Sheen's character was no surprise, either. The film abruptly ends there, no resolution for Mario, no look into what became of Rynn. Still, this movie is worth watching, for Foster's performance at least.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
45,meddlecore,Much Molestey Tension...,7,12 October 2017,"This film is crazy...because in today's day in age, it just wouldn't be done. At least not in any mainstream way. It stars 14 year old Jodie Foster as Rynn...and it sexualizes the sh*t out her for the entire film. There's even a nude scene where she gets fully naked in a back shot with her tits hanging out in full view (though it's actually her older sister Connie...the implication is still pretty nuts).The very first scene is one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a film since the Irreversible rape scene. It is legitimately f*cking disturbing. It features a 36 year old Martin Sheen sexually accosting 13 year old Rynn, because he knows she's alone. Literally molesting her.He's known throughout town to be a child molesting rapist, but was married off to a cocktail waitress with two kids- by his racist mother- so that he could look normal.The mother also has it out for Rynn. She's also her landlady and knows something is up, because her father is never seen around- and also hates Rynn because she is a Jew.But Rynn always has an excuse for why he's not around. She always has an excuse for everything. She's a great storyteller, and uses it to her advantage.One day, however, the landlady dies, accidentally, at Rynn's house. And she tries to cover it up.In the process of this she attracts the attention of a young crippled magician boy who is probably 17 or 18. He helps her cover things up by hiding the car and redirecting things when a cop (his uncle) shows up asking questions. He also defends her from Sheen when he comes back and more than suggests he is going to rape her as soon as he leaves.She grows to trust him. And he soon becomes the only one she can trust, because she manipulates him into becoming complicit in the cover up.Which brings me to what makes this film so goddamn creepy, and kind of f*cking great! She is by no means a victim in this film, despite her sexualization, she is a very strong, liberated female character...at least in the film (as for Jodie Foster, in the rest of general reality, is up for question). But, as a film, it is excellent.For example, think about the story she tells the boy while they are sharing tea...and then think back to what she was doing with the mother before she accidentally killed herself. That was a lucky break! And great use of foreshadowing.It's the subtle little details like this- and pedophilia induced creepiness- that made this a cult hit. It literally had me going...""this is crazy""...the whole time. There's so much molestey tension in here.She does put out to the kid! First, it's implied...but pure, because they are both virgins, right? Then is the infamous boob scene. But through the whole film her breasts are augmented to be the center of attention- especially in scenes when she is alone with Sheen or the cop. And at risk of being molested.As a character, however, she seems to be a bit of a sociopath, and it was almost like she uses sex to manipulate her now boyfriend into never betraying her- using him to her advantage- rather than out of any actual love for him...at least at first. As she does seem to genuinely love him by the end (though she definitely would have offed him if she thought he had talked).This is definitely one of the most f*cked up films about rapey predators I've ever seen. Sheen has the creepiness of Kinski in Crawlspace, and the overall cringe factor of Irreversible. It's disturbing as all hell.The perfromances from both Foster and Sheen are great. Critics noted this was Foster's best performance yet- her most realistic portrayal of a child.Growing up as a child actor, might explain why...7 out 10.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
46,sjanders-86430,1976 thriller and love story by Laird Koenig,10,5 February 2021,"Nicolas Gessner directed this wonderful film in Kennebunkport, Maine. Verzier the cinematographer captures the place and tone of suspense. Scott Jacoby plays the magician, Mario. Martin Sheen is Frank Hallet the town pervert. Alexis Smith is Mrs. Hallet the landlady of the house where Rhynn Jacobs played by Jodie Foster lives. No one has seen Rhynn's father. Then Mrs. Hallet can't be found. Loves develops between Rhynn and Mario. She is 13 and he is 16. There is never a dull moment with Foster's authentic performance anchoring everything. This is a love story between a teenage boy who has had polio and a girl whose smarts make him fall for her as we do. Foster is that rare young actor who was born to act. She takes control of the stage with her brilliant eyes and quirky mouth. She was actually only 14 when she did this. If you love Jodie Foster, you will love this film.

48,johnstonjames,A Very Controversial Nude Scene By Foster At Thirteen,9,9 October 2012,"i had the privilege of seeing this great movie again the other night and was happy to see it stood the test of time and was even better than i remembered it. it was also more intense than i had remembered.first of all i had forgotten that Foster did a nude scene in this film that was every bit as controversial as Brooke Sheilds in Louis Malle's 'Pretty Baby'. the scene wasn't exploitive or dirty and wasn't even all that eroticized. it was used for character development and realism. she is also having relations with a boy named Mario who is more or less her own age.the whole film as a matter, is handled with good taste and restraint. nothing, including the nudity and violence are done in a cheap or crassly exploitive way. doesn't mean the film is a crashing bore either, on the contrary it's still thrilling and suspenseful and probably more believable than more over the top approaches in other thrillers.everything about this movie is well made and done with excellence. it is more about it's acting and screen story than tricky camera angles or cheesy FX. there is very little bloodshed but the morbid events still send eerie chills and manage to shock you.of course one of the best things about this is Jodie Foster's thoughtfully deep performance. even at the age of thirteen, Foster was giving performances that were way beyond her years and of the same caliber or even better than her adult contemporaries.this is a excellent film for thrillers fans and of course a must see for Jodie Foster fans. though little or no bloodshed occurs, i can guarantee that thriller fans won't be bored or disappointed.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
49,killercharm,Did not age well,3,4 July 2021,"This flick did not age well. The presentation is particularly outdated in the lack of on-camera action. Here we have a darling 13 year-old girl who is graduating to serial killer as we watch, except we don't get to watch. We therefore miss out on what could have been a particularly jarring juxtaposition, even more so than the one every teenage Jodie Foster movie uses and that is her disarming wise-beyond-her-years manner. That is front and center, delightful as ever. This movie also lacks a fleshed out back story. To bring a teenlet to murder (and her own mom, at that) you need something rotten in that little tiny state.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
50,MattyGibbs,Unusual and effective thriller.,8,2 June 2013,I watched this for the first time recently. I must admit i'd never heard of it but it looked like an interesting film so i gave it a go. It stars a very young Jodie Foster who even at a very young age you could tell was destined for much bigger things. This is a very difficult role for a child to play but she is outstanding in this film with a maturity far beyond her years. Good support is given by Martin Sheen as the local neighbourhood paedophile and Mort Shuman as the kindly cop. I found this a very strange and slightly surreal film in a lot of ways but never less than intriguing. It's quite a creepy little thriller as you try and guess what the girl is hiding in the cellar. It does contain a truly horrendous musical score that wouldn't have been out of place in a seedy 1970's porn film. There are also some controversial scenes that might upset and offend some people. Overall this is a very good film and well worth watching for Jodie Fosters startling performance alone.,The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
51,PedroPires90,Very good story - couldn't have been made today,8,14 September 2021,"People overthink too much these days. Sometimes films are just stories. End of. They don't need to encapsulate a moral lesson, they don't need to have a meaning, they don't need to tell you what's good or bad (even if in the end the bad guy learns his lesson here). Yes, the nude scene is maybe too much (even if it's a double) but it's curious that Americans can be so sensitive about nudity, but dont blink an eye watching 13 years old dying on the news, bombing weddings in foreign countries or teenagers with guns. Weird people.I'm glad society was much more open a couple of years ago, not so shocked about everything and that it was possible to made a film like this. A brilliant thriller/drama with two fantastic actors showing their skills. Great cinematography, a fantastic use of music that is very rare to see these days and a mystery that will keep you interested until the end. A lesson: you don't need a 100M budget to tell a good story and youth is not an excuse for bad acting.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
52,Ali_John_Catterall,A genuine original,8,12 November 2009,"Jodie Foster doesn't like this film. ""When people are there to simply do a job they don't have any passion for,"" she is reported as saying, ""those are nearly always bad films."" Presumably, her unhappy memories of the shoot (she refused to do a nude scene; she was 14 at the time) prejudiced her against the movie. This is a shame, because The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane, based on the novella by Laird Koenig, in no way disgraces a fascinating CV. Fortunately or otherwise, we are merely spectators to the end result - a flawed, genuine oddity, with a lot going for it.A post Taxi Driver Foster plays 13 year-old Rynn Jacobs, the eponymous, wildly precocious 'Girl' living alone in a rented house by the New England coast, surviving on travellers cheques and misdirection. We gradually discover that her celebrated poet father has died, though this fact must remain a secret, lest she be taken into care.We also learn that she is disliked by her horrid landlady (Smith) and the feeling is mutual (""This is my house,"" she whispers defiantly at Mrs Hallet's retreating back), although her bad wolf of a son Frank (Sheen) would certainly like to see more of Rynn.There is a secret under the trap door in the living room. Soon there will be two secrets. And there are two innocents, a kindly local policeman (Shuman) and his teenage nephew, the polio-crippled amateur conjurer Mario (Jacoby), who are drawn into her desperately self-contained world. The certain tragedy is that, like some barbed exotic insect with an impenetrable defence mechanism, Rynn seems destined for a life of eternal, wintry desolation.Though originally promoted as a horror by perplexed distributors (tagline: ""Ask Her No Questions And Nobody Dies!"") the film defies pat categorizing - at various junctures resembling a stagey, Hitchcockian suspense thriller in the Rope vein, an existential drama, even at times a romantic comedy, albeit a distinctly unsentimental one.Its closest cinematic neighbours are The Cement Garden and Hard Candy, although there is practically no bloodletting and, whether through design or fluffed direction, few sudden shocks. It might also be read as an allegory of anti-Semitism, with the Jewish, Hebrew-studying Rynn fiercely protecting her culture and lifestyle from the local, close-ranked WASPs: ""Thirteen and brilliant, as so many of your people are,"" sneers Mrs Hallet; 'brilliant', the equivalent of the Oriental-directed 'inscrutable'.Mostly, as suggested by the title, with its echoes of the playroom, The Little Girl is steeped in the dark, tangled stuff of folk and fairytale; the domain of evil witch queens who must be vanquished; of ogres who threaten pubescent, tower-bound princesses; and of heroic young wizards who come to their rescue. Archetypes that grow up alongside us, becoming wilder, more dangerous and more unpredictable as we reach our teens.""How old do you have to be before people start treating you like a person?"" complains Rynn, no longer an infant, but still possessed of the vulnerability of adolescence; it is touchingly, appallingly sad that Rynn believes she might be able to deflect Sheen's advances by telling him she is a year older than she actually is; 14 not 13. If the courageous Mario has sworn to uphold her honour with his dazzling sleight of hand, all his tricks are rendered powerless in the face of this thirtysomething predator (""Be a good little magician would you son, and disappear yourself"") who even drops by on Hallowe'en; two years before Michael Myers.It is up to Rynn, drawing on all her resources, to defeat the monster with her magic potion by the end of the story. All performances here are exemplary, from Foster's wise-beyond-her-years title role to Sheen's bullying child molester, a brave and potentially career-burying role coming so soon after Badlands.There's great support too from Smith, Jacoby and 'Viva Las Vegas' songwriter Shuman, also responsible for the lovely main theme - though hopefully not the dreadful incidental wah-wah, familiar from 1970s cop thrillers.Such incongruous intrusions, along with some flat, TV-movie direction and the queasy sight of Foster (or rather her body-doubling elder sister Connie) jumping naked into bed with Mario, don't do the film any favours; between this, Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone, poor Jodie had by 1976 become as prematurely sexualised as a Bratz doll. And for a movie dealing with paedophiles, this seems dreadfully close to an own goal: no wonder Foster would prefer to forget Little Girl. Yet ranged against the standard 1970s psychothriller, this haunting little picture is in a class of its own.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
53,jonathan-577,sneaky and subversive,9,24 October 2009,"Where most 'international' cinematic ventures are crass exercises in lowest-common-denominator mathematics, this film is a remarkable fusion: clean-cut North American narrative meets European philosophical desperation. You can't imagine how the movie occurred to anyone, and you can't quite believe you're even watching it. It's almost like an evil twin to Jodie Foster's other Canadian tax-shelter film of the same year, Echoes of a Summer: a made-for-TV type movie about a resourceful kid in a small town and her precocious little friend, only in this one there's bodies in the basement, Martin Sheen tortures her hamster, and the beloved controlling father figure has gone away for good, leaving only his warped imprint on Foster's brain. Her project is to resist the corruption of 'normal' society by any means necessary, and the slowly revealed outcome is devouring solitude and emotional self-devastation. By the time we get to the mind-bending final scene, the horror is complete: unable to envision any escape beyond the horrific desperation her father has implanted, she fails to achieve even that; and yet there in front of her is ample evidence that the outside world really is irredeemably evil. Gessner (where'd he come from? where'd he go?) takes us all the way into Foster's head without losing his balance for a second.

58,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,One of the most intriguing thrillers I have seen,8,1 March 2015,"Jodie Foster isn't an actress who appears in many movies, for a reason. She carefully selects her roles which is good as she has never let me down even when the movie isn't up my alley. She makes it worth a view even if only once. Not so with this movie as I have seen it like 3 times last year and surely I will re-watch this over the years to come. Obviously based on a book with some great characters, Jodie Foster as the little girl Rynn living with her father the poem writer in a house close to the waterside. Nothing special at first only that she is bothered by some nosy people such as the landlady, the local cop and last but not least the pedophilistic creep marvelously played by Martin Sheen. when they come around her father is never and Rynn finds an excuse to get those people out as soon as possible. That begs the question where is her father or what happened to him? And why doesn't Rynn want anyone checking the basement? Some questions do get answered, some do not.

All I remembered was a little girl killing people and a bad lady's head getting whumped by a cellar door. What surprised me most about watching it as an adult is Rynn's sexuality and how it was played so matter-of-factly. She's a 13-year-old girl forced to grow up too fast and discovering her own sexuality while becoming the object of creepy pedophile Martin Sheen's affections.Speaking of Sheen - he's wonderful here as a first-class psycho creep. Too many viewings of the West Wing, where Sheen is a benevolent and often doddering character made me forget he used to know how to act.The movie itself is quite good and holds up well. Rynn is given depth: she doesn't kill for amusement, but to survive as her father instructed her. The scene where Sheen kills the hamster is incredibly vile and there's a nasty undercurrent throughout the whole move.

It is Foster who keeps us riveted to the screen, as she is surrounded by a fine array of ensemble players, including Martin Sheen and the incomparable Alexis Smith.The first part seems more creditable than the latter as characters are introduced and the story line unfolds in a spooky manner. There are a few loose ends in the script's second half that are effectively covered up, and the quickie production is good-looking throughout.In reading Foster's biography, I was amazed she began acting at age three and chalked off nearly fifty film and TV appearances before attending college.

69,blandiefam,70's Need For Skin,6,29 October 2010,Jody Foster was pretty good in this movie but I could tell she was phoning in some of the scenes. I thought the whole premise was good but not too believable. She kept asking if a 13 yr old should not be considered a person. That seemed like a 70's pedophilia European way of thinking. For some reason the 70's had a few movies like this where the child actor was required to do a nude scene. Brooke Shields was the worse of them. The horror label was not deserved. It was more of a black comedy with a little bit of mystery thrown in. I love the way the writer makes all of the victims deliberately evil so the audience could be more sympathetic for the lead. It was still captivating with the way the story moved on. That same year Jody also did taxi driver. Another child exploitation 70's film. I was about the same age then and the clothes and the atmosphere of the film took me back. Great movie to watch with some popcorn and warm coco.,The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
70,AshokePrabha,Living and Dieing alone.,7,18 June 2007,"I have seen this film yesterday on Pix. As many of the comments say it is beautifully directed, photographed, scored and acted. In a culturally different country like my India, the plausibility of such a story is almost zero. This is the most striking difference I realized while watching this film. In here, people would seem as nosy as any westerner would hate to be. Particularly in villages. Everybody knows everybody + everybody's secrets.(But still they are secrets!). Whether willingly or unwillingly they are into other lives. Now there is a question arises about nosiness. Where would we draw the line of nosiness? If a new person enters into the village and visits a house, probably the next day everybody in the village knows who he is. In this movie Jodie Foster's dad is never seen by anybody in the village and still nobody actually cared (only bizarre people cared; that too for exploitation; logically policeman must have verified). Few years back I read a news (that happened in London or somewhere in Europe). A 50 years old man who was a clerk in an office found dead(heart attack) on his desk while working, after 5 days. Nobody noticed him dead for five days in that busy office. This movie is made in 1976; almost thirty years back. What's the situation now? Now the plausibility is even more. Even it is very much possible in one of the big cities of our country(India) too. As human become more and more civilized and more populated there seems to be a strong orientation towards being away from the 'crowd'. It is also the part of the 'ego' that internally wants to be 'acknowledged' but exposing out a contradicting note to be left 'alone'. Human is a social animal. In the future this statement might have to be rephrased as 'Human is a lonely social animal'.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

72,matjpi,This is _my_ house ...,10,21 February 2012,"A young Jodie Foster shows exceptional maturity and skill in this sadly underrated play-to-film. It's unsurprising that it has become something of a cult classic.The setting and season were well chosen; coastal winter. Cosy romantic fires set alongside wintry isolation. A birthday greeting from a mirror. All the ceremony without the warmth and laughter of others. This inexpressibly cute and vulnerable kid, alone against the world. It worked perfectly: I wanted to tuck her under a blanket on the sofa in front of the fire and read classics to her until she slept. That put me in ideal shape to forgive almost anything she would later do.The independence of Rynn's character stems from her ability to internalise her feelings whilst outwardly appearing somewhat sociopathic. She never says anything insignificant and she chooses her words very carefully.Despite her outward coldness and manipulative skills that are way beyond her years, it's hard not to love Rynn as she verbally fences with Cora Hallet who considers Rynn more of a defiant nuisance than a person. Cora recognises Rynn's blazing intelligence quite quickly but not quite quickly enough. The dialogue is clever and well performed. Cora's death was a bit clumsy but Gordon running in his wheel neatly echoed how Rynn's mind was also spinning a way to handle this new problem.Mario's character fits well with Rynn's as she settles effortlessly into a trusting partnership with him and I felt genuinely sad for Rynn's character when Mario fell ill and she visited him. Suddenly her world of isolation was reaching out and pulling her back in just as she had discovered that she could love and trust another person.Rynn handles Frank Hallet, a psychopathic paedophile, very well in the end though there is always the question of whether she intended to kill him or herself as Frank says ""You know how to survive, don't you"" to which her reply is ""I thought I did.""This is a real gem of a film with solid turns by the supporting cast and an unforgettable performance by Ms. Foster.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

74,steve-ruzicka,Interface,8,26 August 2020,"First, it is a pleasure to discover Jodie Foster as a teenager actor. Beyond her promising actress career in this movie, there is an emotional attraction to her role.
She navigates the interface between early teenager and young woman, with the identity of higher maturity. The interface plays at various levels: strong will and subduction, secrecy and trust, maturity and child innocence.
Difficult not to like her character and wanting to help her go through the bleak and grey world of adults.

75,harrytrue,Great Movie,10,9 October 2005,"I recall seeing this movie soon after it came out (on TV). It made an impact. I later read the book.The movie differs from the book, in that in the book, Rynn murders (there is no other word), Mrs. Hallet and her mother. In the movie, they have accidents. She does poison Frank Hallet, to avoid being molested by her.The relationship between Rynn and Mario is sweet. Rynn feels the need for someone to share her life with, on terms of being and equal, and Mario is willing to go along with it. It might have been something for them to have sex, but Mario is not taking advantage of a child, like Frank Hallet would. It is a relations of equals. Their ages are not that far apart. As Mario comments, the guys talk about sex. He's getting some, and keeping quiet.A nice dated thing. Mario walks with a limp because of polio. In the United States and Canada, this is so yesterday. Sadly, until polio is wiped out, we must keep up our guard.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

77,Marjeez,Foster's Best Performance,10,23 July 2010,"Jodie Foster, at age 14, portrayed a real-world adult in her best performance in a film. It is awe inspiring seeing a child actress act in such a beautiful and professional way. I started with the acting because with a film that offers numerous memories, the acting of Jodie Foster is something I will never forget.I suggest the few people reading my review to refrain from reading the plot line. I skimmed the plot, and whether I'm a dyslexic or I have a mental disorder, I missed a key part in the plot that I believe made the film much better and mysterious. Below is the plot line the filmmakers wanted to give the viewers before going into The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Road, but I have taken two words out. I suggest you refrain from finding out anything else; it's unnecessary. ~A 13-year-old resorts to murder to protect herself.~The main character Ryann, despite what stereotypes you may have about teenage girls, is not only the most interesting teenage girl I have ever seen (fiction and non-fiction), but also one of the most interesting characters in a film I have seen. This may be due to my uninteresting life, but that's the honest truth. She's intelligent, witty, devious, independent, dark; but that changes until she lets the viewer enter her life, and that is when I felt like I truly knew her. She isn't a one-dimensional character, and her actions are worthy of discussion.Even though I have raved about the characters and acting, that is not enough to warrant a viewing for most people. It may be a simple and short film, but The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Road is also unique in a small way. I doesn't achieve anything out of the ordinary, but it's something you never imagined seeing on-screen. It's a little hard to explain, but once you (hopefully) give it a chance, you'll know exactly what I was saying. It's the simplicity that gives it that masterpiece status because the character development, emotion and wonder packed into this one short film will make the viewer feel tricked, and mesmerized, in the greatest way possible.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

I am unlikely to forget her expressions in many of the frames. Come to think of it, when I think of her acting today, I see only the same controlled delivery. She really carries this movie. About this movie. Very simple story and yet powerful. Plot is good and fits 1976 era of culture - when society probably was more restrictive to kids. Plot - Rynn Jacobs is a thirteen-year-old girl who lives in a secluded house that she and her father have rented in a quiet seaside community. Rynn's father is never seen by anyone even if people tried and doesn't seem to be around, and it seems as if the girl is all alone.

81,Hesse-02,Mediocre and overrated,2,19 October 2008,"This movie is a bit of a curiosity. I'm not surprised that people picking up the DVD expecting to see a horror movie are a little disappointed. Yet, with the provocative product description one might, at least, expect a thriller. This is how the movie was sold in its day and how it continues to be sold. For me, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" has always been an interesting character study--but not one that is that creepy and certainly not in the ""horror"" genre. Basically fills the need of a middle age pedophile as we get to see Jody (using a body double, as that of her 14 year old sister) in a nude scene, getting in bed with her best friend. I thought the performances were self conscious and the believability of the film to be ridiculous. Could be remade to be much more creepy, much more believable and actually a HORROR picture. As in my view this film has none of the above.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

83,barbecuedbanana,Very interesting film which leaves questions unanswered...,9,11 October 2008,Jody Foster plays her part with skill and believability as the young girl alone at home doing what she has to do to survive. Slightly reminiscent of 'Arsenic and Old Lace' with Cary Grant and his eccentric aunts.The film differs from the book according to Wikipedia in that she intentionally murders Mrs Hallett in the book whereas Mrs Hallet dies accidentally in the film.Throughout the film we are only told what happens to Ryn's parents by her. Personally not sure whether or not to believe her entirely as she shows herself to be a convincing liar throughout the film.I would like to know how she got that chipped tooth for example? Perhaps a hint of violence from her past? Martin Sheen was very creepy as the paedophile son of Mrs Hallet and I was shocked at how much he resembled his son Charlie from his role in 2 and a half men.Mario was played well and Officer Miglioretti was a wonderful rest from all the other adults in the film who were either just fleetingly on screen or villains.Put me off almond biscuits and tea for life though.,The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

Outstanding performances from Scott Jacoby (who was also in Bad Ronald in the 70's--if you haven't seen that either...don't miss it!!) and Martin Sheen. The entire cast is great...other small roles that are definitely worth taking a look at our  Alexis Smith (Mrs. Hallet) and Mort Shuman (Officer Miglioriti).

87,PetalsAndThorns,A tedious tale with all the grace and speed of a flat tire. FAIL.,1,14 June 2014,"Stilted, unnatural acting, something of an amateur community theatre calibre.A tedious and unbelievable tale, any hint of mystery and macabre is quickly squashed by boredom and ill-chosen ""tell me"" rather than ""show me"" elements in a script that moves along with all the grace and speed of a flat tire.Crap acting, lazy direction, obnoxious score, lacklustre lighting, poorly constructed story, badly written script ( with an unnecessarily disturbing implication of animal torture and murder, to which the characters don't have any emotional reaction whatsoever) round out this pitiful disappointment into one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. How this ever managed to have a 7-star rating on IMDb is beyond me.This horrendous flop of a film would better serve as kindling. Don't waste your time.(The only thing that kept me from shutting it off, 30 minutes in, is a personal goal to see all of Foster's films... no cheats. So far, this is the only one that has been painfully bad.)",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
88,carmmm4,Incredibly creepy little tale,5,29 January 2011,"This story is best described as a dramatic thriller. It's not a horror film per se (not even remotely in the same vein as a modern slasher flick). I felt a little tense, but definitely not scared while watching it. With that being said, I think it's appropriate to keep the ""horror"" tag associated with this film for the simple fact that I personally found the story developments with Martin Sheen's character to be more than a little horrifying. I was incredibly uncomfortable whenever Frank (Sheen's character) was on screen.I think the acting in this movie was quite good. Jodie Foster is excellent in this movie and I'm not surprised that she won an award for her role. Her character is resourceful and resilient, while reminding you at times that she still is a vulnerable little girl. Martin Sheen's creepy character was not very subtle, even from his very first appearance in the film, but Sheen still manages to make him very credible. Scott Jacoby also did a decent performance in his supporting role as Mario.As for the plot, it moves rather slowly but deliberately. The setting rarely changes (and I mean *rarely*), but I didn't find myself noticing that so much because I found the plot rather gripping. For those in my generation and younger - if you are not old enough to have seen this film during its original release, I'm talking to you - *please* remember that this is a dramatic thriller from 1976. As such this is a plot driven movie, not an action driven movie. Things do happen during the course of the film, but don't expect excessive blood and guts, nuclear explosions, random car chases, alien robots, or other special effects creations that are commonly used in modern films. While I do like movies that contain those things and I'm not knocking them, I can tell you with certainty that they are not present in this film. If you have found that you require state-of-the-art special effects or fast-paced action in order to really enjoy a movie, you will do yourself a favor by skipping this film. You're almost guaranteed to find this movie to be slow, boring, and action-less.Now, as much as I applaud this movie for its strengths, I did only rate it a 5 out of 10 for a few reasons. First, some of the characters' actions, Mario's in particular, just didn't seem like normal human reactions to the situations that were unfolding. Secondly, I didn't feel like there were any dynamic characters. The plot certainly pulled back a couple of layers of truth so that the audience understands more at the middle and end of the film than we do at the beginning. However, I didn't feel like there were any character changes (for better or for worse), important realizations, or growth/development for any of the characters in the film. I didn't know what to think at the film's abrupt end, other than repulsion. I couldn't find anything exactly to take away from the film, whether a moral message or a thought-provoking concept or a sense of ambiguity and wonder. While something in my psyche enjoys being scared by films, I don't particularly care for films when the only major reaction they elicit from me is disgust. I tend to prefer psychological thrillers (basically those are the ones that make the audience say at the end ""wow that was a mindf*** - for lack of a more sophisticated expression). Perhaps I've been poisoned by the ""Saw twist"" that modern horror movies try to duplicate, but I just felt like there was something lacking in this film. I felt empty at the end. I'm not sure if that was the point, but if it was, then it explains why I will not be watching this movie again.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

I love the soundtrack, the funny scenes with the pervert Mr. Hallet, and the whole story! The only thing I hated was the scene where Hallet burns the poor hamster with his cigar and then throws it into a fireplace. Despite the innocent title, this movie is NOT for kids! However, it's always been one of my favorite movies. The story follows a 13 year old girl (Jodie Foster), who is sort of a misfit and recluse, untrusting towards anyone. Any adults who get in her way, she kills and then hides elaborately. A pervert also begins stalking her, and she falls in love with a high schooler magician, too. She'll do anything to keep her life safe.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
93,alistair_deacon-1,If you thought Foster's role in Taxi Driver was disturbing....,1,30 October 2005,"If you thought Foster's role in Taxi Driver was disturbing, you ain't seen nothing yet...I don't know how to rate this movie, but it made me feel dirty. It is an interesting thriller where Jodie Foster plays a 13 year old girl who lives by herself in a cottage in a quiet little town and hides some dark secrets that you discover as the film progresses. Most of the ""thrill"" factor of the film comes from Martin Sheen's character who is the local pedophile (everyone in town knows about his 'predilections') and is trying quite transparently and disturbingly to prey on Foster's character. Along the way, Foster's 13 year old character ends up having a love affair with a boy from the local high school who is a crippled amateur magician (no kidding).Foster is an incredible actress, everyone in the film does a good job, and this film has plenty to recommend it. However, the pedophile theme is disturbing and sometimes crosses into exploitation. What is particularly bothersome to me is that after we have this whole Martin Sheen the detestable pedophile theme played throughout the movie we are then shown a tender love making scene between Foster and her crippled magician boyfriend, including nudity as they disrobe (I don't really want to see sex scenes with 13 year old girls, and I especially don't want to see sex scenes with naked 13 year old girls, OK?!? I felt like I needed to go take a shower after watching this.), forcing us to view Foster's 13 year old character in a sexual light. As far as I'm concerned, that is exploitative and really is intended to play for kicks to a pedophile element in the audience. The easiest way to express the message of this movie would be: ""Little girls -- so innocent, and yet so sexy."" It's f--ed up if you ask me.There is some satisfaction, however, in the fact that Martin Sheen's character gets his just desserts in the end. The film is well made, the acting is superb, and it is certainly something from out of left field, so to speak. Were it not for the weird themes and situations, however, this film would be little more than a collection of genre clichés.The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane reminds me of The Blue Lagoon (Brooke Shields) in that it is a well made, beautiful, thought provoking film, and yet I really wouldn't allow my children to be around the people who made it. However, The Blue Lagoon has much more to recommend it than The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane. I would only recommend this film to genuine Foster connoisseurs or to people who are really looking for some strange and unique cinema to see, because this certainly is strange and unique. ...How this movie was ever rated 'PG' is beyond the scope of my considerable imagination. Recommended only for well-adjusted adults.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
94,Scot6,Not Your Typical Story Line! What a Terrific Off-Beat Thriller.,9,18 July 2000,"Great Suspense and Atmosphere. This movie instantly became one of my all-time favorites and is difficult to describe without giving too much away. More than most movies I can remember, reading too many comments about it's content beforehand can detract from the viewing experience (and a great one at that!) and ruin the suspense. I will try not to give too much about the film away beforehand.  First of all, I loved the production quality, atmosphere and locale. It would be a great movie to see on Halloween night for example, at least in my opinion. It really can be watched anytime however and will be just as great. The acting was high quality, all the way around but especially with Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen and the direction and score are excellent as well.I had a problem with the plausibility of Jodie Foster's character behaving essentially as an adult. It was a little tough for me to buy into a 13 (or newly turned 14 year old) cooking gourmet meals, serving fine wines, listening to Chopin and generally acting much older than her chronological age.   Even taking into consideration the events in her life which apparently had shaped her personality, she seemed too mature for her age. If you put that concern aside however and accept it as a given premise of the movie you can sit back and enjoy the fun of trying to figure out what's going on.And trying to figure out what's going on really *is* fun in this movie. Figuring out what's going on with her mysterious father is enough to keep you occupied in itself (if you think you've figured out what's going on with him you will find later that you probably haven't) and that's only one aspect of this complex scenario.   I hate when movies this good are not in general circulation any longer. Brian de Palma's ""Sisters"" and many other excellent movies also fall into this category. I can't figure out why studios can't figure out ways to continue to make them available to the public, after all...they went to the trouble to make them in the first place.If you do get a chance to see ""Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" however, jump at it.

He price? Utter loneliness. What story could be more true? I takes a strong personality to stand up for all this and endure it. In fact she's so strong about it, she makes one faint. I never met a more enthralling character (both in the screenplay i am lucky to have read and in the movie as performed by Jodie Foster).So what's with the viewer, the compromising, settled down, despicable grown up? It's hard to look into the mirror and acknowledge: ""They. They have won!"" If you're not that grown up and kept fighting don't feel like loser or no one loves you. Your are not alone. Luckily life isn't a drama piece, so we hadn't to kill anybody over it. It just takes this: Stand your ground! For people who liked this movie i also recommend Christine Rocheforts ""Printemps au parking"" (German title: Frühling für Anfänger). I felt a bit cheated by it, because it turned out be a gay-emancipation piece in the end.

98,richardcostantino,Foster Is Mesmerizing,7,25 October 2021,"Critics have wildly differing views about this movie. To be honest, it's a bit of a slow burn, and there's no jump scares or buckets of blood, so any horror or thriller afficionados might be disappointed.This movie is better appreciated by movie fans who like good acting, intelligent scripts, and general creepiness.It is important to remember the Jodie Foster was only 13 when she made this movie. How many 13 year olds in the world could pull off such a mature and demanding role? Certainly not the Home Alone kid. Given her prodigious talent, she should have become a star as bankable as Pitt or Di Caprio - yet, apart from Silence Of The Lambs, her talent has been largely wasted.The other standouts in this movie are Martin Sheen and the under-appreciated Scott Jakoby. Sheen is suitably creepy as the sick pervert. On a surface level, Jakoby's character is just comedy relief, but Jakoby is extremely likeable and sympathetic, and his character displays a sense of wisdom that is often lacking in Foster's character.I enjoyed this movie immensely - in spite of the plot holes.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
99,kwugboots,Irony of the directors pairing 14-year old Foster with a 21-year old boyfriend in a film about a pedophile,6,15 July 2009,"Overall an interesting and good film, with some pretty good acting from one of my favorite actors, Jodi Foster.The film is a semi-thriller that deals with a 13 year old girl who provides for herself. No one in the village has seen her father for a while, but the girl keeps insisting that he is upstairs in the house, but sick/tired/working.A local man attempts to sexually abuse her, and the local police officer tries to keep an eye out for her because he knows that this man has molested other children. His mother is a powerful and wealthy woman in the community, so thus far her son has been able to escape the law. The girl is resourceful, quick-witted, blunt, and can provide for herself.She befriends a local crippled boy who is practicing to become a magician. He is a sweet, gentle and funny guy. When the molester man bursts uninvited into the girls house one night her boyfriend attempts to kick the man out of the house again to protect the girl. At the end of the film the man again creeps into the girls house one night, and it is up to the girl to try to ultimately outsmart him.I have two problems with this film, which may be interconnected.ONE: Jodi Foster didn't like making this film, this is her least favorite of the films that she has done, she did not like working with the 2 director men. I like Jodi Foster and I respect her so this makes me automatically feel some dislike towards this film. Jodi Foster didn't want to do the nude scene, so the director's got her older sister to do it instead of her. I don't think Jodi wanted that scene to be included in the movie when she was 14.TWO: This film is about a pedophile. What is ironic is that the two (male) film directors paired Jodi Foster (aged 14 at the time of filming) up with a much older boy (aged 21ish at time of filming) and made them be boyfriend/girlfriend. The directors included a scene where Jodi (actually her sister) removes all of her clothes and climbs into her bed next to her seemingly naked older boyfriend (we don't see much nudity, only Jodi's sisters' naked back). It is ironic and creepy and just wrong that the directors would do a film about a pedophile, yet include a dodgy semi-naked scene involving a 14 year old girl (who is supposedly just-turned-13 in the movie). Directors need to be extra careful when they do films concerning child sexual abuse that they don't portray the child too sexually. It is ironic that in a film about a nasty pedophile the directors make the 14 year old girl get naked with a 21 year old man (if sex happened, that would be statutory rape) and treat it as innocent/normal. I got the uncomfortable impression that the directors may have had subconscious motives when they made this film. They certainly were not sensitive in their portrayal of child sexual activity/nudity.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

104,Mina-Mina,Proves that Jodie Foster ALWAYS had GREAT acting chops!,10,21 October 2017,"The first time I saw this movie, I was a kid of maybe 7 or 8. (I was about 2 or 3 when the movie came out). My parents were both educators, and in the summer, they ran the local summer recreation center at the school. On Fridays, they would sometimes show movies that were rented on reel-to-reel from the library and shown on film projectors. (Ah, memories! I do believe VHS was just becoming a ""thing"", but my dad like the old-timey sound and feel of the movie projector. But I digress!) I have NEVER forgotten this movie, and so began my lifetime love affair with Jodie Foster. OF course I own this film on DVD and it is one of my regular watchable's during the month of October when I am watching ALL things suspense, horror, and macabre. As I am currently watching this movie on a very typical, cold and rainy fall day in the Pacific NorthWest, I am once again reminded of the small details that make this movie so enjoyable. The acting is FANTASTIC. Both Jodie Foster and Charlie Sheen nailed their roles with the perfect amount of tension, suspicion, and confidence. The director knew that subtleties made that much more of an impact than over-the-top actions (Pay attention to ANY of the scenes with the Foster and Sheen.) And truly, all of the actors were very believable in their roles. I especially liked the way Foster carried herself while at the bank. Her actions were very precise and direct. (I wasn't even aware that identity fraud was a THING back in the late 70's.) The pace of the film is appropriate, and I while I always ""know what's gonna' happen next"", I still get caught up in the suspense and drama of it all. Good times!!!",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
105,lucio@rocketmail.com,how could i have missed this one?,10,10 October 2005,"Even though I have heard and read about this movie for over 20 years, I never actually saw it until the newly released widescreen DVD. THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE is one of the best written and well acted films I have ever seen!! Although you will most likely find this title in the ""horror"" section at your video store, it is a solid mystery / suspense story. I have to say I was so impressed with the intelligent screenplay that I never lost interest even for a minute. The fact that the film is rated PG should not let that sway you either. There are some dark, chilling moments and innuendo that would probably gain the film an R rating today. By the way this DVD is the European cut which has a few moments absent from most U.S. prints! Also the soundtrack contains some funky heavy bass driven music that totally reminded me of Goblin! One of my greatest pleasures in life is to discover or re-discover old movies through the magic of DVD. Thank you MGM for making this title available!",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
106,MrAccident,"""A lone 13-year-old resorts to murder to protect her haven.""",8,7 November 2011,"Talking about spoilers!!! Thank god I didn't read it, before watching the movie. I just watched it because of some recommendation; and only checked the rating on IMDb. Otherwise I think it would ruin a lot of the experience. So I suggest to change this title! I mean, IMDb warns me not to forget to check the ""Contains spoiler"" box, soo... Hah... it's like mentioning that Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator II is the good guy; come on!Now a few words about the movie; I mean it's a review right? I think that what made this movie so good (relatively to other movies) is, more the Casting then the Directing or Writing. Great actors. Today I see a lot of movies with far more original and great ideas, and a great budget and technology; but they don't put enough emphasis on the fine details; how the film looks and feels exactly, in the end.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
107,pstankavich,Jodie and Martin show their dark side,8,24 June 2006,"I see where Jodie Foster gets her strong side for her more recent films. She plays a 13 year old who can make it on her own in a way I have never seen before. Antiestablishment yet capitalist enough to know how to survive the plot shows her force full but not sassy. Martin Sheen lets us know his character is a sneeze from the start. Just about everything he does or says makes you want to bury the character alive. The film does have that 70's look but the drama is timeless. OK, maybe I am a hopeless Jodie and Martin fan, but this DVD definitely needs more attention. However the DVD should have a rating more strict than PG. I wouldn't want my kids acting like this.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
108,ventures01,DVD at Last,8,9 August 2005,"This film is finally about to be released on DVD. And, at long last, in the widescreen version. www.Amazon.com shows it as an October 4, 2005 release and www.DVDempire.com has the DVD picture.The local used for the film fits exactly. First of all, I loved the production quality, atmosphere and locale. The acting was first class and shows Jodie's soon to blossom strong talents. Martin Sheen probably won't be happy to see his character reprised, he is not a nice guy in this film, especially with Jodie Foster. The direction and score are excellent as well.The plausibility of Jodie Foster's character behaving essentially as an adult stretched things a bit. It was a little rough for me to buy into a 14-year-old cooking gourmet meals, serving fine wines, listening to Chopin and generally acting much older than her chronological age. Even taking into consideration the events in her life, which apparently had shaped her personality, she seemed too mature for her age. If you put that concern aside however and accept it as a given premise of the movie you can sit back and enjoy the fun of trying to figure out what's going on.The film takes pleasure with its twists and turns and will keep you guessing.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
109,R-W-Watkins,A Thinking Person's Suspense Classic: The Ultimate '70s Cult Film.,10,16 March 2006,"A Thinking Person's Suspense Classic: The Ultimate '70s Cult FilmLet me make a few things clear from the outset: If you are totally unfamiliar with such philosophical schools of thought as social Darwinism, Nietzshean non rationalism and Randian objectivism, then this is not a film for you. If your life is unquestionably governed by the theological, political and/or legislative dogma(s) of the day, then this is not a film for you. If you think the boundaries separating children from adolescents from adults should always be contingent on chronological age, then this is not a film for you. If you (mistakenly) think that a paedophile is someone who forces him- or herself on teenaged females (as, apparently, several folks out there tend to think, judging from some baffling comments and reviews I've seen posted/published regarding this movie), then this is not a film for you. Yes, folks, this is, to put it bluntly, a film that can be thoroughly understood, appreciated and enjoyed by only the truly educated and open-minded (or those who are at least on the right path--usually the young, bright and liberally reared). Having said all that, let me now say this: Nicolas Gessner's The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane may very well be the best and (definitely) most Hitchcockian film that The Master never made. In fact, released in the same year that Hitchcock released his swan song, Family Plot, TLGWLDTL makes the more famous other film look incredulous, child-slanted and philosophically shallow in comparison--more like an episode of Hanna-Barbera's Clue Club--despite the latter being an excellent second rate Hitchcock classic. Yes, TLGWLDTL is that good, making far better use of a dimly lit living room than Family Plot, in spite of the latter's much bigger budget.But atmosphere is only part of the film's magic (magik?). The applied philosophy and symbolism inherent in the film is equally significant. In addition to the egoist and survivalist philosophies utilized in the plot (Is it just a coincidence that Jodie Foster's title character's name, 'Rynn', is most likely derived from the Old Welsh 'Ryn' ['ruler', 'monarch'], and bears a striking resemblance to 'Ayn Rand'?), there is both the Biblical and Holocaust-era Judaic symbolism intrinsic in the picture. Thus one can find the Passover (complete with the lamb's blood--i.e., the outside light--above the door), the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ (if one has already seen the film, think about it--otherwise, I don't want to spoil anything for potential viewers), the standard bas mitzvah (Rynn's use of a Hebrew linguaphone record) and kosher eating habits (no milk after lamb chops), and the house-to-house Nazi searches for hiding Jews (the adults' intrusions). The original 1974 novel by Laird Koenig has even a gas chamber, and Jewish casualties represented by the oft-mentioned falling autumn leaves. It unavoidably draws comparisons with Albert Camus's existential novel, La Peste/The Plague (1947).I could go on and on about the film's thought-provoking theme of Traditional Child and Adult Roles and the Often-Blurry Lines Between Them (the mature, intelligent 'adults' of TLGWLDTL are the children and vice versa); the continuity errors made manifest by the fact that it was shot on at least two locations in--according to Astral Media--Knowlton, Quebec (hint: watch the windows, curtains and banisters); its plausible symbol of Rynn's pregnancy towards its end; its possible influence on Sonic Youth's 1998 double LP A Thousand Leaves--right down to the album cover; the possibility that Mario the Magician (Scott Jacoby) and the magazine rock star (in the novel version) were based on Marc 'T. Rex' Bolan (1947--1977); etc.; but that would amount to excessive spoon-feeding--speaking of which, I have probably done enough already. Watch the film--if you feel that your outlook and education level fulfill my criteria outlined above--and discover such particulars, anomalies and minutiae for yourself. Who knows? You may uncover things that I haven't even considered--in spite of having seen the film close to a hundred times since I was a child in the '70s. (You may also want to read the original novel in the process.)For those who are serious or long-time fans of this film (and/or the novel it's based on), they may be interested to know that I have published a chapbook of haiku poems, New England Country Farmhouse, based on the tale. As well, I am preparing the second issue of Cellar, a TLGWLDTL fanzine that delves into many of the sub-topics that I've briefly discussed or alluded to above. The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane is an excellent and rewarding film for those who are intelligent, curious and dogma-free. For mentally, emotionally and socially advanced children, it can also serve as a good introduction to secular philosophy, ethics, and symbolism in the arts--as can another early Jodie Foster film, the even rarer Echoes of a Summer (also 1976). It is definitely NOT, however, recommended for those who adhere to the dogmatic standards of the Extreme Left or Extreme Right. Neither is it recommended for those who report having to bathe (for whatever specific reason) upon viewing brief scenes of adolescent nudity. Only a long-term committal to a reputable mental institution can be recommended for these individuals.Despite (barely noticeable) continuity errors and one alleged crew member sighting in the shadows (which actually only adds to the film's spooky atmosphere) this is without question an overlooked '70s cult classic.

110,erawlins-2,Restrained thriller better in memory than reality,5,17 March 2006,"I first saw this film on television when I was a 'tweener, and had very fond memories of it for its unhurried yet unrelenting pace, and its quiet, urbane horror (though, as many have correctly pointed out, this is a mystery/thriller, not a horror movie). So when I saw it was finally available on DVD, widescreen and uncut, I purchased it without hesitation. But, after watching it last night, thirty years older (and hopefully wiser), I have re-learned two lessons: one, anticipation usually far exceeds the actual event, and two, everything looks better through rose-coloured glasses (and nostalgia, my friends, is always rose coloured).From the very first frame, which lurches on-screen with the title already visible (no black screen intro, no title fade-in) to the ludicrous ""music by Christian Gaubert and Frederic Chopin"" credit (for those of you whose memory is a little cloudy, Frederic Chopin died 130 years before this film was made) to the horridly intrusive wacka-wacka fuzz guitar soundtrack bits (sounding as if they were pulled from some lurid porno or an episode of Starsky & Hutch) to the constant, unsure use of the zoom, TLGWLDTL screams ABC Movie of the Week ineptness in its first seven minutesand rarely rises above that level for the remainder of the film. While it does have its moments, including a memorable ending sequence that is just shy of brilliant for its understatement and restraint, TLGWLDTL as a whole is a movie just barely better than the sum of its partsand there is a lot wrong with most of the parts.Perhaps its primary weakness (aside from the aforementioned soundtrack, which reeks of cheese worse than a Kraft worker's farts) is the directing, which is amateurish and confusing. I frequently felt there was no intrinsic meaning to what the characters where saying and doing; instead, I was very aware that these were actors following the director's orders, whether it made sense to or not. Often, the characters seem like ping pong balls, bounced from one motivation to another as they reverse direction and intent according to the dictates of plot and script.For example, when Rynn first meets Frank Hallet, Hallet spends five minutes ""seducing"" her, then suddenly switches gears and smacks her on the ass as he begins bouncing around the room claiming in a boisterous voice that it's his right, since it's her birthday. Then he suddenly shifts gears again and begins acting wary and frantic, as if he'll get caught, when  having acted inappropriately with her from the very beginning  he should have been wary all along. Or, later, when Rynn meets Mario and asks for help, she reads her lines first nonchalantly, then snobbishly, then pleadingly. Perhaps a more experienced actor could have pulled this offbut a more experienced actor would have played Rynn smart enough not to fall prey to the snotty impulses of a child half her age (and a better director would have kept her from playing it that way in the first place).Along with this, the reading of many lines simply does not fit the action on-screen. For example, when Rynn, feigning agreeableness, asks Mrs. Hallet if she'd prefer Darjeeling or Earl Grey tea in a civil, even solicitous manner, Mrs. Hallet responds ""I don't care for your tone."" Then, when Rynn says she must apologise, Mrs. Hallet snarks that Rynn isn't like most other children from England, who are ""so well behaved."" Um, what? If offering tea and apologies isn't well behaved, what is?Many of these problems stem from the movie's second greatest weakness, an inept script. While Laird Koenig wrote a great, chilling little novel, TLGWLDTL shows him to be far less talented at adapting his own work for the cinema. What Koenig took pages to do in the novel had to be accomplished in seconds on-screen, resulting in awkward bits of exposition and spin-on-a-dime changes in action and emotion. Worst of all, whereas the novel smartly maintained a consistent vision of Rynn as a cold, calculated survivor who only becomes stronger, like iron in a forge, the worse her situation gets, the script tries to have it both ways: Rynn as a victim of circumstance and her own overweening intelligence, with the deaths around her being accidentsand Rynn as a methodical, restrained Bad Seed, calculating the ""erasures"" of those who would disturb her idyllic retreat and operating without compunction or remorse.Finally, the film misses so many opportunities to be more than a mystery thriller that it's almost criminal. For example, when Mrs. Hallet is killed and Rynn steps outside, she sees a carload of teenagers go by, carousing after winning an intramural football game. This would have been a perfect moment to expound upon the differences between a normal childhood and one burdened by isolation and a profound intellectbut the film does next to nothing with the moment. Or it could have made incisive socio-political statements about the powerlessness of youth, letting us sympathise with the problems of Rynn's plight while simultaneously rejecting her sociopathic solutions (much as we do with a certain Tony Soprano, or Vic Macky, or even Norman Bates). But TLGWLDTL merely lets Rynn talk about such issues, rather than showing them and making us empathise.I really wanted to like this movie, having had such fond memories of it, but I just couldn't. And a sampling of the comments here clearly shows that the vast majority of users who do give it glowing reviews have not seen it since it first aired almost thirty years ago. Granted, it's much better than most of the Grand Guignol gorefests and histrionic thrillers Hollywood churns out today, but I felt I needed to be the voice of reason (rather than remembrance) in all this sea of nostalgia and point out that this emperor, while not totally without clothes, is not as finely arrayed as most here remember it to be.(5 out of 10 stars.)",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane
111,rynnfrink,The most amazing movie of all time.,10,25 January 2000,"Well, what can I say?  The plot is wonderful, the acting is wonderful, the atmosphere is wonderful.  Sheen, Jacoby, and Foster are absolutely outstanding in this movie. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 17, and it instantly became my favorite.  During my 5 day rental period, I must have watched this movie at least ten times.  I couldn't get enough, and I still can't.  Until I bought the movie I rented it continuously.  In fact, I think I'm probably the only person in my town who has.  Heheh.  I rarely come across anyone who has seen, or even heard of, this movie, and certainly no one who considers this movie a favorite, which is unfortunate.  Everyone who I have watched this movie with has loved it.If you have seen the movie, you should also read the book.  It has more depth and details.It's horrible that this movie is out of print and not on sale.  Hopefully, sometime in the near future, someone will come to their senses and release it.I see in many places that LGWLDTL is considered a ""dark comedy,"" which I couldn't disagree with more.  It's a suspense/thriller flick, in my opinion, though there are a couple of parts when I do laugh.  (Such as when Rynn slaps Mario's hand when he tries to pick up her hamster/rat (it's a rat in the book), and when Mario's flipping out when Rynn tells him her secret and she casually asks him to take the cookies in where the tea will be.  These things strike me as humorous.)I'll wrap things up now.  Bottom line:  See it.  You'll love it.",The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane

They act as a reference point for your life and experiences.For me, this film was one such. I saw this about 4 times when it was released. I was aged 14. Jodie Foster played Rynn, a 13 year old in the film. I was an only child. Rynn was an only child.(I think this was the first and only time I had a crush on a fictional character - the shots of the birthday cake with facial close-ups are still vivid. The - at the time - exotic kaftans added to the ambience.)The murders and threatened child abuse aside (!), this is a story of survival, of independence, and of a growing realisation of a need for others.There are many levels to this movie, and I would love to see this again.

118,jenk264,Intriguing,10,16 March 2013,"I read an earlier review from Scot6 who talked about Jodie's behavior as a 13 year old hard to believe because she was too mature. Well, that's what makes Jodie Foster who she is. It's always been discussed by older actors who worked with her at this age that she was so mature and adult like for as young as she was. Jodie was able to act by just being herself, yet become the character. So many of her scenes seem so natural(slapping Mario's hand away from the hamster, dropping the note her father wrote after Mario handed it back) I wonder if they weren't ad libbed or a mistake(dropping paper) yet left in because it was so natural and believable. Foster is amazing for her age in this movie. It makes me want to know more. Does Mario help her bury Sheen? What does the cop do with the footprints he noticed behind the house? And what will they do about the pervert missing or will anyone even know, since Rynne was sly enough to tell the cop that everything was fine and she was alone that night? No car to get rid of because he didn't drive there. Would love to see a sequel to this but only with Foster playing Rynne as a 50 year old.

I don't know why she doesn't like this move cuz she is great in it even with the delicate material and taboos in this film it was comfortable for me to watch not like ""Taxi Driver"" which disturbed me when I saw it on late night T.V. a few years later and edited for T.V. In the late 1990's I got the book as an old beat up paper back novel for 50 cents at the library and the book follows the screen play well minus ""RINN'S"" English accent and a few in-depth character developments and scenes that would'ave made the picture far too long the arthur and screen writer, Laird Koening, did a wonderful job with the screenplay, This is a perfect example of cooperation with the director,writer and producer.
