0,MartinHafer,excellent but not among his very best,7,20 January 2006,"I absolutely love the films of Akira Kurasawa and have seen most of them. And, for some reason, this is not among my favorites although it is one of his highest rated films on IMDb. Perhaps I'm just being too picky, but I think MAYBE its popularity is because it was made somewhat recently and some of his older (and I think more interesting) films are sometime forgotten. After all, MOST of the IMDb reviewers are old enough that they could have seen this film on the big screen, while very few could have seen his earlier films in all their glory. The other reason why I think it's a little overrated is that his version of Macbeth (Throne of Blood) is the best retelling of Shakespeare and so Ran, despite it being wonderful, pales if you see them one after another (like I did). And finally, the characters and their interactions are just sterile--with little understanding or life to the them.So what DOES this film have going for it? Well, the word is SPECTACLE. Like KAGAMUSHA (which came out around the same time), it had a big budget and glorious locations. It is simply a gorgeous film to see. Some watch Kurosawa for the spectacle, I tend to look more at the characterizations which are really secondary in this film.Give me a film like Kurosawa's IKARU or SCANDAL over a film like this.",Ran
1,TheLittleSongbird,Akira Kurasawa's take on King Lear,10,10 June 2012,"I loved Kurasawa's Throne of Blood, and heard this was even better. And indeed it was, for me second only to Seven Samurai as his best film and one of the finest movies ever made. As with any Kurasawa film, it is superbly made with the camera work in look and technique masterly and the colour and period detail really sumptuous. The battle sequences are even more epic in scope and emotional impact than Seven Samurai, aided by the spectacle and camera work. The music is rousing and haunting, almost sometimes paying homage to Mahler, the script is literate and thoughtful and the story intensely moving. Add to that Kurasawa's ever immaculate direction and the truly remarkable lead performance Tatsuya Nakadai and you have an even more brilliant film. Rounding off is the truly Machiavellian performance of Mieko Harada as the daughter-in-law figure. The over-two-and-a-half-hour length and slow pacing didn't hinder Ran in the slightest, at least to me anyway, though some not used to Kurasawa's style may be deterred. In conclusion, there wasn't much I really could add to the wonderful reviews already, but I do think Ran is a superb film with much to admire. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Ran
2,Leofwine_draca,Kurosawa's late historical masterpiece is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations out there,9,24 October 2016,"This was my fourth Kurosawa film and my favourite to date. Previously, I'd started off by watching SEVEN SAMURAI (a great film), then trying out KAGEMUSHA (which I thought was okay, but too constrained by budget). Next up was an early classic, RASHOMON, which was a fine human drama, and now comes RAN, Kurosawa's final historical epic and the film that he claimed KAGEMUSHA was a mere warm-up for. I can see that. RAN is an epic film, truly epic and one of the best-shot films I've ever seen. Every frame of the film seems to have been painstakingly composed and the result is a bright, colourful, and vivid production that fully brings to life the castles, costumes, and characters of feudal Japan.Tatsuya Nakadai, returning from KAGEMUSHA, here plays Lord Ichimonji, an immensely powerful ruler who concedes that power to his three sons at the film's beginning. However, his plans quickly go awry and before too long he finds himself ostracised from Japanese society and a literal outcast. This film is a loose reworking of the Shakespeare classic King Lear (another favourite of mine), something I really enjoyed as Kurosawa takes elements of the Shakespeare plot without following it slavishly. One of the best inclusions is the fool, who comments on the on-screen antics the same way as he did in the Shakespeare play.It goes without saying that RAN is a tragedy and, indeed, it must be one of the most tragic films I've ever witnessed. Those looking for a happy ending should go elsewhere as this is all about doom, despair, and overall the failings of human nature. There's a fine cast of stand-out performers but one of the best has to be Mieko Harada, whose Lady Macbeth-style character is vengeful and terrifying. Nakadai, unrecognisable in ghostly, age-old makeup, is outstanding as the lord losing his mind, and Kurosawa is there to capture every little nuance. The most dramatic part of the film is a massacre set in a castle which is full of on screen death and destruction and successfully depicts the ferocity of battle better than 99% of other films do.Like most of the Kurosawa historical epics, this is a lengthy and slow moving film, one that emphasis characterisation over action, plot over incident, but it's well worth sitting through. In the end, I found this one of the most rewarding films I've ever watched and anybody who professes themselves to be a fan of the cinematic medium should have it in their collection.",Ran
3,SnoopyStyle,Shakespearean Samurai Epic,8,27 July 2016,"Warlord Hidetora Ichimonji is haunted. He divides his kingdom among his three sons; Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. The oldest Taro is given the First Castle to lead the younger brothers. The youngest Saburo objects and he is banished. Another lord Fujimaki takes him in and offers his daughter for marriage. Taro's wife Lady Kaede lost her blood family to Hidetora's ruthless conquest and plots to destroy the family from within. Taro and Jiro force Hidetora from power driving him to madness.Legendary director Akira Kurosawa delivers a big production of mass battles and epic drama. It's one of the grandest samurai epics. It is wonderfully beautiful. The acting is big. It is visually stunning.",Ran
4,Hitchcoc,A Masterpiece of War and Greed,10,16 September 2009,"This is film that everyone needs to see. It brings home the horrors of war, betrayal, and greed. When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying. She is nearly a carbon copy of the woman who played the wife of Mifune's Macbeth character in ""Throne of Blood."" I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon and am convinced that this may be his finest work.",Ran
5,Horst_In_Translation,Daunting descent into despair and desolation,6,3 March 2019,"""Ran"", which means translated ""Revolt"", bit this is not really used as a title for this film, is a Japaese/French co-production from 1985, so it will have its 35th anniversary next year. This movie is linked inevitably with Akira Kurosawa, by many considered the finest non-American filmmaker of all time, and it is a late career effort by him. He had already been in filmmaking for way over 40 years when he came up with this one we got here thatg turned into one of his career-defining movies. It is of course in contrastg to most of his earlier stuff in color and runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes. I guess it was a tribute to Kurosawa that the Academy really appreciated this one as it also could have been a film that could have gone completely under the radar. However, it scored 4 Oscar nominations, one of them being for Best Costume for which it took home the award. And I think all these nominations are not undeserving. On the contrary, one or two acting nominations, for Nakadai and Haradai perhaps, would have been appropriate too. Butg lets get into the film. This is the story of an influential old Lord (played by a much younger actor by the way) who hands on the power to his sons. Too late he recognizes thatg he made a huge mistake that may not only endanger his heritage, but also his life eventually. But while the sons are pursuing their violent path, there is a new threat rising with a women full of revenge. Can the last remaining son help his father find a way out of his misery? Watch for yourself. One thing I want to emphasize here is that I mentioned earlier Kurosawa made many b&w films, but the way he uses colors for this film proves without a doubt that it is a shame he did not make more color films. For example before and after this film, there is a break of five years each. Anyway, with colors I was referring to red, yellow and blue mostly here, the colors symbolizing the sons and their armies. Things get heated for the first time when the old patriarch kills one of his soldiers' sons who was about to kill one of the old man's guards. Blood is not thicker than water in this case and the blue son (lets call him that) predicted it correctly. It takes a long time for the father to understand and a really rocky journey during which he turns from one of the most influential men of his country into an old bum you could say that is considered insane by many.However, he is not, he only may seem that way. His final words and actions show that and even if his body is ailing, his mind should not be mistaken for being gone. I want to elaborate a little bit more on how this film is so different than what an American or probably also European movie about this subject would have looked like completely away from the country where it is set. With this I am mostly speaking about the blue son. We may have seen a from zero to hero storyline involving him à la Gladiator and this would have resulted in a much weaker movie without a doubt. But this is never his movie, not one bit. He is basically gone for almost the rest of the film after he is sent into exile by his father. Even if he was the only one getting it right, this does not mean he is at the center of the story. When he returns, he is killed off pretty quickly and that sure came surprising, even if the father's words about how he has so much to talk about with his son somewhat indicated it would not happen. But yeah, I expected the dad to die, but he sure is a fighter. And when he finally concedes, this results in probably the best moment of spoken language and dialogue, well rather monologue, and again this comes from a character we hardly know anything about when there is an elaboration of how nobody should blame the Gods for humans being greedy and violent enough over centuries to destroy everything and everybody around them in their insatiable hunger for power and always wanting more. Instead on the blue son, the film focuses on the power struggles for those who are in power actually, the yellow son, but evenmoreso the red son, who runs into a woman who is even more ruthless and cold-blooded than he is in exacting her revenge for those she lost and losing them destroyed the last bit of empathy inside her. I must say while watching the film I struggled a bit with this character also how she uses her power and almost kills the red son out of nowhere. It is interesting how women (wives) were far more than quiet bearers back then. But the more I think about this character, the more I like it and I think it is a worthy addition, also shown by the fact that I mentioned the actress deserving a supporting actress nomination at the Oscars. But she was probably too unknown for that. Anyway, fittingly she gets also killed all of a sudden by another minor character. It feels realisic. It is never about the big players doing the crucial deeds here, but just anybody for whom it feels right looking at their anger.Yes this is a really long movie, but in my opinion it felt far shorter than over 2.5 hours I must say. It is definitely with all the customs, traditions and very style-focused sequences not a film that will appeal to everybody, but if you manage to make a connection, then you are in for a high-quality movie. Like mostg other Japanese films, they are doing completely without comedy. Even the foxhead scene that may seem funny to the untraiend eye has far more dramatic depth than just the intent to make you laugh. And even if my rating may not make you think like that, this is one of the most powerful anti-war movies I have seen. It is uncompromising, realistic and not scared of taking untraditional parts when it comes to story-telling. And completely away from the story, this is really a mesmerizing watch visually in terms of cinematography, costumes, make-up and art direction. Something every film student should see really, not just those from Japan. I can see why many years after Kurosawa's death and even more years after films like this one have been made, so many still cite him as a gigantic inspiration and dedicate their works to him. I was lucky enough yesterday to watch the film on the big screen, a really rare occasion for such an old movie, but I am very glad I took it and if you happen to get the same chance I highly recommend you to take it. The more I think about this film, the more I like it. There were more thna just a few scenes and moments that deserve a higher rating than 3 out of 5 stars, but overall this is what I am going with at this point. Maybe I will increase it on rewatch we'll see. Also I want to call this film a formidable period piece as, even if there were firearms included, it plays several centuries in the past. This genre is not just about English royalties, but here we have a very different approach showing everybody how it needs to be done. A real powerhorse of a movie and I am glad it got the attention it received back then and is still seen by many today. Also a huge success from the technical perspective if we look at sound effects mostly and yes the soundtrack is really good too, but also visual effects (the scene where the red and yellow army chase down the old man is a true spectacle and I am saying this as somebody who normally couldn't care less about visual effects). So many high-quality production values here. And to end it all, finally a few words on the very last scene, the blind woman at the abyss. Well, I understood it as follows. She may be blind, but still manages to recognize the abyss before falling into a most certain death. Those who see are not that lucky. Or not that smart you could also say. So you could say Kurosawa leads the human a mind a bit ad absurdum eventually. But that's what he has done all the way before that too because there is no reason to all the insanity in here. That's all folks. Don't miss out on this one.",Ran
6,classicsoncall,"""The enemy is everywhere. Inside and out.""",8,7 April 2017,"I find myself in the same quandary with Akira Kurosawa's movies as I do with Hitchcock. I find some of them great and others just so-so, even if they're heralded by the professional critics. Having just watched Yimou Zhang's ""Curse of the Golden Flower"", I was pretty well conditioned for another film about Orientals in a dysfunctional family attempting to take each other out. The disconnect I have here is why all of a sudden the three brothers would have turned on each other without their father, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai), having an inkling that they were so mercenary and self serving. I'm also put off by the histrionics and aping aspect of some of the principals. As an example, the facial contortions of Hidetora reminded me of John Belushi doing his eye squints as the Samurai character on 'Saturday Night Live'. Somehow it takes away from the seriousness of the character, as when Hidetora jumps off the cliff and winds up none the worse for wear in the valley below.Maybe it's just the frame of mind I was in when I watched this film. I didn't have a total appreciation of ""The Seven Samurai"" until a second viewing, so that might be the case here as well. But with so many movies and so little time, it will probably be a while before I get back to this one.",Ran
7,gavin6942,Samurai Legends Meet Shakespeare,8,24 November 2014,"An elderly lord abdicates to his three sons, and the two corrupt ones turn against him.Is this Kurosawa's masterpiece? One would think the title of masterpiece ought to go to ""Seven Samurai"" or ""Rashomon"", and they are probably right. But an argument can be made for ""Ran"". The blend of traditional Japanese storytelling with Shakespeare? The years Kurosawa put into this, story-boarding every detail? And those hundreds of colorful, handmade costumes? Certainly this deserves recognition.If nothing else, we can probably say this is Kurosawa's finest film in color. He may have been more influential in the 1960s, but this does not mean he ever stopped making great films.",Ran
8,jboothmillard,Ran,8,10 June 2013,"From Oscar nominated director Akira Kurosawa (Ikiru, Dersu Uzala), this Japanese film in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was one I had heard the title of plenty of times and was really looking forward to watching. Basically the story is a reworking of the William Shakespeare tragedy King Lear, and it begins with the Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) stepping aside as leader of his people and giving control of the empire to his three sons Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), Jiro Masatora (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo Naotora (Daisuke Ryû). The three songs are all have youth on their side to rule the kingdom, the eldest Taro is given the prestigious First Castle, while Jiro and Saburo settle for Second and Third Castles, and the Lord only wishes to be an honoured guest in these three castles for the continuing years of his life. The two older sons make their father happy, but the youngest may want to cause arguments by warning his father that the uniting of the three brothers to have control will not remain united after some time. Enraged by this the father banishes the young son for pointing out this potential danger, however the warning does come to pass when the oldest son plots with his remaining brother to take everything from their father. With all this going on a war is declared and battles are fought, the formerly powerful Lord Ichimonji is stripped of his former glory to the point where he may die, murders are committed within the closest family and friends, and in the end is only a bad ending for the particular characters. Also starring Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, Hisashi Igawa as Shuri Kurogane, Masayuki Yui as Tango Hirayama and Yoshiko Miyazaki as Lady Sue. The story was just about easy to understand, I admit the first half an hour or so was the most interesting, but the rest had some interesting moments, the costumes were absolutely deserving of an award, and the battle sequences are great to watch, although I drifted in tiny moments I know overall it is a great epic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTAs for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!",Ran
9,Tweekums,King Lear in Feudal Japan,9,27 May 2016,"This film, Akira Kurosawa's version of 'King Lear' set in feudal Japan, tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his three sons Taro, Jiro and Saburo. The elderly lord gathers his family and talks about how he started off in a small castle but gradually defeated all his rivals and now controls the entire area from the largest caste. He finishes by saying that he had decided to retire; he states that Taro, his eldest son, is to inherit the absolute leadership and Jiro and Saburo will inherit the second and third castles respectively and must support Taro. Saburo, the youngest son, suggests that his father must be mad to stand down arguing it will only be a matter of time before Taro and Jiro turn on him. This leads to Saburo's banishment but it isn't long before his words start to be proved right; first Taro makes his father's position at the First Castle untenable then Jiro refuses his men access to the Second Castle forcing him to head to another castle. Here Taro and Jiro's forces attack; Taro is killed and Jiro takes his place as dominant warlord; Hidetora escapes with his fool but Jiro still wants him dead anybody familiar with Shakespearian tragedies will know that there won't be a happy ending for any major character.As with his previous adaptions of Shakespeare plays director Akira Kurosawa does a brilliant job transferring the stories to Feudal Japan their themes fit the era perfectly. It explores the idea of revenge as Lady Kaede, Taro's wife whose family was killed and lands taken by Hidetora, seeks to destroy the family from within. Likewise it shows the thirst for power as Taro then Jiro try to destroy their elderly father despite the fact that he has handed over all the real power. The battle scenes have an epic feel; especially when Hidetora is the sole survivor as the castle burns and arrows fly past him. Hidetora's subsequent descent into inevitable madness is shown as he travels through various places he destroyed on his rise to power. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; you don't have to be a fan of Shakespeare or familiar with Kurosawa's other films to enjoy this.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",Ran
10,Quinoa1984,"My third favorite Kurosawa film- deliberately paced (not painfully so), heavy on tragedy, and glorious in overall artistry",10,16 August 2004,"I would agree with Ebert's review on a point, that Akira Kurosawa, legendary director of such samurai classics as Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, and Kagemusha, as well as human dramas like Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and Red Beard, could really best direct this film in his old age. There's something about his version of the doomed King Lear of Shakespeare, his Lord Hidetora Ichimonji that could be truly captured by someone in old age. Not to say that directors can't make great films when they're young, or in middle age, about a man in the dark days of the golden years (About Schmidt, Tokyo Story, Bob Le Flambeur, and Kurosawa's own Ikiru come to mind). But it's clear that Kurosawa must've seen or felt or understood at least an element of Hidetora's character, something that goes beyond tragedy that is stuck with all who are mortal. At one point when Hidetora is in a wandering, dazed state he says ""I am lost"", to which his companion/caretaker Kyoami responds ""Such is the human condition."" Was Kurosawa lost as an artist and filmmaker as he tried to get his epic (which at the time of it's filming was the most expensive Japan had seen, and got some extra backing from outside European backers) off the page and onto celluloid? Hard to say, but the end result displays that even in his later days he could create a work so wonderful, so sad, so brutal, and so human that it will remain timeless. If Kurosawa deserves praise for look of the film, the pacing, the editing, every single painstakingly storyboarded (painted) shot, and his direction with the two battle sequences as well as with the quieter, more compelling scenes with the actors, the man who plays Hidetora deserves some as well (like any production of King Lear, including Godard's wild treatise with Burgess Meredith in the lead role, the actor is as important as the writer). Tatsuya Nakadai, who had roles in past Kurosawa films as a young man in Yojimbo (the gunslinger) and Sanjuro (the opponent), is awe-inspiring. Early in the film, after a mind-shattering dream, his character decides to split up his kingdom unto his three sons (Jiro, Saburo, and getting the first castle and all control, Taro), he still feels in control, and has the look of a Lord with just the right level of stubbornness and, unfortunately, naivety. Then, as everything he owns crumbles before him, there is one scene that struck me as remarkable, and then for the rest of the film I couldn't take my eyes off of Nakadai whenever he was on screen. It involves the first battle sequence, in which one of his son's comes to take over a castle, and killing all of Hidetora's men. Look at Nakadai in the scene where he's sitting down stone-faced amid the chaos going on outside, and then as he somehow manages to walk out, the fellow soldiers making way for him. He then sees one of his sons, the betrayer, and he doesn't say a word- he's already decided that his son Taro has gone too far with his position, as he rules over his domain and scares the peasants right out of the picture- and he simply walks away, as his family continues to crumble under corruption of the mind and heart.It's a sequence like that though, where the great Lord makes such a radical change, where Kurosawa and Nakadai have some of their greatest time ever on a screen. As the filmmaker treats the battle, up to a point, like a feudal-Japanese version of a Eisenstein battle (no talk, no sound effects, just the eerie, sorrowful score here applied by Toru Takemitsu) with devastation and visceral nature taken to a poetic, thoughtful level, the actor's eyes and body language are, well, indescribable almost. And if Nakadai gives the finest male performance of the film, credit is equally due to the pivotal female character, Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), who is like a Lady Macbeth taken to the next level. This is a character that's seen Lord Ichimonji destroy his castle when she was young, and now that she has her son(s) right in the palm of her hand, she'll have her revenge in guise of ego-feeding. I may not be able to recommend Ran on one level, despite it being on the painter's equivalent of a splendorous, seething portrait of royalty. Kurosawa takes his time telling the story, and to some it might even feel longer than his epic Seven Samurai. This is a work heavy on emotional nuance, on how the characters (in particular Hidetora) look unto their surroundings, how the presence of destruction and war and slayings are traumatic as opposed to being 'cool' in a stylistic way. If you're looking for a slam-bang action thriller look, elsewhere. But if you're looking for a mature film about life, death, loss, and the bonds that are kept within families, the mind, and how we accept and give forgiveness (a blind character named Lord Tsurumaru is stunning from a certain point of view), this is it. As well for the Shakespeare fan it's an absolute must-see, and it may even turn some onto Shakespeare's classic due to the fact that this film, much like Throne of Blood, contains none of the language style used in the source.",Ran
11,BandSAboutMovies,Classic,8,18 July 2021,"Ran means chaos or turmoil and that's what's at the heart of Akira Kurosawa's take on King Lear and Mori Motonari. The director had been planning to make this film for decades and this was the realitization of a decade of painting the storyboards for this film. It would be his last epic and the most expensive film that he would ever make.Beyond the autobiographical nature of this story, Kurosawa also saw the battle scenes as metaphor for nuclear warfare and the high anxiety after Hiroshima. There's also the influence of Japanese Noh theater for two of the protagonists, Hidetora and Lady Kaede, whose single-mindedness stand in contrast to the rest of the cast of characters.Hidetora is a powerful warlord at the close of his life who has decided to divide up his kingdom amongst his sons, with Taro gaining the First Castle and the leadership of their family, while his brothers Jiro and Saburo are to support him and live in the lesser castles.The wise old man explains unity using three arrows. It is easy to snap one arrow but three together are more durable. Saburo snaps all three arrows and calls his father a fool, which leads to him and a servant named Tango being exiled. Fujimaki, a visiting leader who watches all of this, agrees with the brash young man and offers him his daughter in marriage.Taro's wife Lady Kaede also demands that her husband go to war, still angry that her entire family was killed by Hidetora. The constant battles - gunfire has replaced swords and arrows - drives the old man mad as he wanders the wilderness, haunted by visions of those he has destroyed in his journey to power.As the entire family follows him into some level of insanity, with war, intrigue and double crosses throughout, it seems as if every castle will crumble into nothingness.How important was Ran to Kurosawa? His wife of 39 years Yoko Yaguchi, died during the production and he only mourned for one day. His eyesight had also completely deteriorated by the time principal photography began, so his assistants used his paintings as guides to frame each scene.",Ran
12,sunwarrior13,Kurosawa's Last Epic,10,24 October 2012,"Ran is Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's reinterpretation of William Shakespeare's King Lear.This epic film written and directed by Kurosawa happens to be his last epic.It features Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging Sengoku-era warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons. It also stars Mieko Harada as the wife of Ichimonji's eldest son. The story is based on legends of the daimyo Mōri Motonari, as well as on the Shakespearean tragedy.The Lear counterpart is an elderly 16th-century warlord, who announces that he's about to divide his kingdom equally among his three sons.In his dotage, he falls prey to the false flattery of his treacherous sons, while banishing his youngest son, the only member of the family who loves him enough to tell him the unvarnished truth. Thanks to his foolish pride, his domain collapses under its own weight as the sons battle each other over total control. Akira Kurosawa's last film is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema.But nevertheless,it enhances the spectacle the same way the spectacle bolsters the drama. Few other directors had Kurosawa's ability to convey the intimate as well as the epic, to handle stillness as well as violence.It's a film for the ages and one of the few genuine screen masterpieces ever released on cinema.",Ran
13,preppy-3,Beautiful but slow,8,5 July 2000,"Gorgeous photography and some great acting help this Japanese version of 'King Lear'.  The only real problem is that it starts off interesting, has an incredible battle scene and then comes to a screeching halt.  It stays that way for about an hour before it picks up for another battle scene at the end.  This movie could easily have been edited--it's way too long (160 minutes).  Still, as I said, the photography was beautiful and I was lucky enough to see a brand-new print at a revival theatre--this film would really suffer on TV.  Good movie, but too long.",Ran
14,CinemaSerf,The Bard would be proud....,8,28 April 2020,"This is one hell of an interpretation of William Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" told in a magnificently vivid, colourful fashion with grand scale cinematography, costumes and matchless battle scenes. It's a well trodden story of a Lord who, rather rashly as it transpires, surrenders his wealth and power to his children on the assumption that he will visit each in turn - on a rolling basis - and continue to live a life of state and grandeur. Readers of the original play will be aware that this not so cunning plan proves to have more flaws than Donald Trump's plans for Domestos; and his initially supportive two sons (as opposed to ""Lear""'s daughters) renege and leave the old man abandoned and homeless; dependent on his third son - whom he banished in a fit of fury when he originally told his father that his plan was daft. Kurosawa combines the rigid formality of Japanese ceremonial existence and familial deference with the raw emotions of betrayal, conceit and desperation magnificently. It's a long film - it'a a long play - but well worth the concentration required to appreciate a cleverly nuanced telling of a visceral story.",Ran
15,grantss,Epic drama,8,17 October 2015,"Epic drama.Set in Japan in the 16th century (or so), an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. However, he vastly underestimates how the new-found power will corrupt them, or cause them to turn on each other...and him...Directed by famed Japanese director Akira Kurasawa (Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Yojimbo), this is a grand, sweeping tale of family betrayal and lust for power. Based on Shakespeare's King Lear but even if you weren't familiar with that work, you can spot the Shakespearean aspects - the family feud, the Machiavellian power plays, the plots and counter-plots, the tragic twists, often from seemingly arbitrary events.Not perfect though. The story could have been tighter - there are a few sub-plots which don't really add anything to the story and just prolong it unnecessarily. Some plot developments aren't explained very well either. And I could have done without the irritating court jester (more like court cynic) character...",Ran
16,Boba_Fett1138,A late Kurosawa that is just as great as his earlier work.,9,13 July 2009,"Over the decades Akira Kurosawa has always maintained his own directing style and approach of a story and characters. For this he got acclaimed mostly throughout his early career, when he made movies like ""Kakushi-toride no san-akunin"", ""Shichinin no samurai"", ""Rashômon"" and ""Yojimbo"". Many people however seem to forget that Kurosawa never stopped making great movies. Reason why his later movies aren't acclaimed as much is because they were all less revolutionary and refreshing, while his earlier works was still very much unlike anything else and influenced lots of western film-makers.The story is told in a typical slow Kurosawa way and also itself features lots of typical Kurosawa approaches and angles in it. The story itself is based on Shakespeare's King Lear, set in the early days of a small Japanese lordship. It has themes such as power and greed in it, which also provides the movie with plenty of intriguing characters, who all have their own agendas throughout the movie. It's characters, themes and definitely the directing of it all is the reason why ""Ran"" works out as a great Japanese epic.The movie often doesn't use to many words to tell its story but the words that it does pick are effectively and carefully chosen. The movie tells the story slowly and things take a while to unravel. But ultimately in the end it turns out to be all very rewarding, like so often is the case with movies being told in such a specific manner.It's a grand movie, with big looking settings, set in the natural environment and on the in- and outside of some large constructed castles. The movie also has lots of extra's in it, of course mostly during its big battle sequences.It's a very stylish movies, of course mainly thanks to Kurosawa's directing. Kurosawa was almost completely blind at the time of making this movie but it didn't prevented him from delivering a visual masterpiece. Each shot and every frame are carefully thought about it seems and everything is planned out and executed into the smallest detail. The movie used three different cinematographers for some reason, who all provided the movie with some beautiful as well as powerful shots.A great late Kurosawa epic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ran
17,evanston_dad,"Grand Kurosawa Film Still Falls Short of ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Throne of Blood""",8,8 April 2008,"Director Akira Kurosawa takes Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and sets it in feudal Japan.What I love about Kurosawa films is true about ""Ran"" as well: he was capable of making popcorn entertainments that were infused with an art-house intellectualism. He made thinking man's action movies. ""Ran"" is right up there with some of his best work, but to me it falls short of what remains my favorite Kurosawa film, ""Seven Samurai,"" and even as his Shakespeare adaptations go, I was more wowed by ""Throne of Blood,"" his visceral re-telling of ""Macbeth."" Incidentally, ""Ran"" brought Kurosawa his only Academy Award nomination for Best Director, and as it has done with so many tremendous film artists, the Academy had to admit that they'd botched things and handed him an honorary award as a consolation prize a few years later.Grade: A-",Ran
18,ElMaruecan82,"""Ran"" is pure cinematic poetry ...",10,30 December 2010,"""Ran"", how such a short, such a light, almost feeble word can be so poetic, so colorful, so tragic, so meaningful ... and so cinematographically beautiful ...""Ran"", what can you say about ""Ran""? First of all, the movie strikes by its stunning visuals, the use of colors and the beautiful landscape shots ... this was one aspect of Kurosawa that obviously couldn't emerge from his earlier works, and I was so used to watch epics in Technicolor, that I wasn't very impressed in the beginning. BUT Kurosawa is so talented, what am I saying, such a genius, that even the use of colors serves as a clever plot device, it's not just to make the movie look better, but also to give you a clearer view of the battles, and the need of colors to distinguish between the armies highlights the central element and most tragic element of the plot, which is that these blood bathed battles are internal, it's between brothers, it's between the sons of a man, who sees all his hopes and dreams annihilated, who witnesses the failure of a whole life, which makes the massacres more and more sickening and heart-breaking especially because it all ends up in the same dominant color in the end.The movie is not just a cinematographic achievement, it's a movie about the power that ultimately corrupts people's souls, a movie showing that greed, for lack of a better word, is bad and leads to destruction and ultimately, self-destruction. The movie is guilty of preaching but not during the preaching scenes, it tells you not to trust those who say they love you or those who throw flowers in your path. Indeed, people who wants the best of you won't feel the need to appear sympathetic in front of you ... unfortunately, power not only corrupts but it also blinds and drowns in the ocean of greed, your intelligence, that can only survive on the boat of humility ... the same humility the Father lacked in the beginning, before realizing when it was too late, how wrong, wrong and wrong he was. Epic Tragedy! Just like ""The Godfather"", ""Ran"" is about the eternal Shakespearian theme of power and succession, but whether the succession in Coppola's crime epic was successful, in ""Ran"", it was a tragic and bloody failure ... how can greed be so destructive? no movie could have illustrated this with such intensity than Kurosawa's masterpiece. And yet, the movie strikes for its beauty, its poetry, and its universality, the king of yesterday can be as worthless as a bum the very next day, your own blood can betray you, to satisfy a pitiful feeling of jealousy, and a thirst of revenge and power. And sooner or later, you pay for your sins. In fact, life is so vicious, that it gives you the chance to satisfy your darkest schemes just to lead you faster to self-destruction ... life as the seemingly indifferent Gods mentioned in the film, are they? regarding indifference and lack of love and empathy, isn't the film inviting us to question ourselves ""well, aren't we, too?"" ""Ran"" means 'Revolt'. Well, it sure inspired me one feeling of revolt ... towards the Academy, the Master has been snubbed so many times, for ""Rashomon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ikiru"" ... I couldn't believe ""Ran"" won only one Oscar and ... for costume design, but time speaks for ""Ran"" now, and the movie is rightfully recognized as one of the greatest cinematic epics and directorial achievements. The movie redefined epic like ""The Godfather"" did for Gangster movies, it gave it a new poetic and tragicomic dimension freed from any dull Manichaeism and other clichés, and to use another cinematic comparison, if ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" makes ""Ben-Hur"" look like an epic then ""Ran"" makes any modern epic look like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ... For one simple reason that doesn't take a long philosophical analysis : ""Ran"" is entertaining as hell, there isn't a single dull, boring or sappy moment, forget the battles scenes, even the dialog, the shots on the clouds, the character development are insightful and masterfully directed ...""Ran"", Kurosawa's masterpiece (I feel like writing a pleonasm) is pure cinematic poetry ... my Respects, Master Kurosawa!",Ran
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A Shakespearean nightmare.,7,6 August 2019,"Though much is often made of its lavish battle scenes, at its heart 'Ran (1985)' is a family drama. In typical Shakespearean fashion (the film is loosely based on 'King Lear'), it just so happens that each core member of that family has an army at their disposal. Even so, the feature is surprisingly light on fights; political manoeuvring, personal backstabbing and threats of full-blown war are far more prevalent. Thankfully, this talking is, essentially, as riveting as any skirmish could hope to be. Of course, familial conflicts often devolve into - and are keenly presented as - physical ones. The stand-out of these is a nightmarish, blood-soaked and oddly ethereal sequence depicting what's essentially a massacre. Its almost madness-inducing mayhem is truly horrifying to behold, with numerous extremely violent vignettes aptly conveying the futility and immorality of the entire situation. This alarming scene kicks off an introspective odyssey for the protagonist, one that sees him almost comatose and forced to come to terms with the many sins he's committed. He isn't a good man - that much is evident even from just the small number of his skin-crawling crimes we actually hear about - but we're able to truly empathise with him, even when he's being pig-headed or brutish. That's because we understand how deeply the betrayals he experiences must cut; anyone would be shocked if their sons treated them the way (at least a couple of) his sons treat him. Make no mistake: this is a tragedy. The plot unfolds slowly, painfully but inevitably veering towards an increasingly bleak conclusion. Its haunting end evokes a sense that perhaps it was all some sort of punishment. However, such bloodshed affects all those near it, not just those that may deserve it. In this way, it never feels fair, it just feels real. It's compelling, strangely affecting and fantastically well-conceived. 7/10",Ran
20,dromasca,Kurosawa's Last Masterpiece,10,1 September 2007,"This is an amazing film, the last masterpiece of one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. Kurosawa was a master of cross-cultural fusion, he started by doing very Japanese music that were re-made by the Western creators, then he took some of the great writers and playwrights themes and gave them a Japanese adaptation. 'Ran' (Chaos) is a perfect blend of the Shakespearean 'King Lear' with the Japanese samurai legends. It is both classical and Japanese, it is universal.The film is of a visual beauty and complexity that words can hardly describe. Action scenes, costumes and the color palette are worked finely to the latest detail. The text has poetical beauty and moral strength and tells a world about wisdom and insanity, getting old and loving one's children, about death, love and treason, and above all about human madness. This is a creation not to be missed.",Ran
21,ThomasDrufke,Sins of the Father,8,23 April 2019,"Akira Kurosawa's last true epic, 'Ran' serves as a fascinating Shakespeare adaptation of 'King lear' which brings the classic tale into the world of Medieval Japan, where a family is torn apart by greed and power. Not exactly something overtly different than other stories from him, but Kurosawa brings a new dynamic to the tale. It's everything from devastating and depressing, to thrillingly brutal. Ran is one of the great samurai films of the century.8.8/10",Ran
22,gbill-74877,Outstanding,9,10 January 2020,"Glorious in its production value, devastating in its commentary on mankind. Greed, selfishness, cruelty, the will to power - these are the dominant traits in man, Kurosawa says, and it's statement about humanity in all ages, whether it be feudal Japan, the 1980's era cold war, or today. Peace and stability are short-lived, we live on a powder keg, and warfare and chaos are inevitable. It's a very dark work that's a joy to watch because of its outstanding visuals, haunting use of music, and excellent performances from a deep cast, including Tatsuya Nakadai (the elderly warlord), Mieko Harada (the wicked daughter-in-law), and Peter (the fool).The 5-6 minutes of chaotic warfare set to symphony music, followed abruptly by the audio cutting over to gunfire and the other sounds of war for another 5 minutes is some of the most moving battle footage I've ever watched. The battle scenes near the end are also magnificent, with the warlords assembling their forces on the plains and those fantastic shots of horseman and foot soldiers scampering forward like a swarm of army ants. Kurosawa is brilliant in using the landscape to show the green paradise we squander by killing one another, and the resulting hellscape of scorched ruins. The undulating hills and beautiful shots of clouds in the sky reflect a timelessness, almost as if they were gods looking down impassively on the madness below.We want to sympathize with the father who has been betrayed, but are told of the many acts of slaughter he committed in conquering his surrounding neighbors, and then in old age we see him make a serious of rash, irrational decisions, so instead we just watch in horror as he descends into senility and madness. While his first and second sons seem like the good, filial types and the third son scoffs and speaks a little too directly early on, note the little clue as to his better nature in the moment when the father has fallen asleep in the hot sun, and he cuts a few branches to erect a makeshift shade for him.There are very few such acts of kindness in the film, but Kurosawa does show us an alternative to all of the violence, and that's the way of peace taught by Buddha, who the other daughter-in-law (Yoshiko Miyazaki) is a disciple of. The scene at the end is a touch didactic and leaves no doubt as to Kurosawa's view on how enlightened we are, but what a lasting, fantastic image he creates.",Ran

24,851222,Great movie,9,20 May 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.To shortly sumarize ""Ran"" (1985), a movie made by a legendary Akira Kurosawa - this is a great movie. It is superbly crafted, greatly acted and written and wonderfully directed. There are few battle scenes, but both are memorable in its own way - especially the haunting castle siege scene done without sound effects, accompanied only by haunting score - amazing sequence. I also highly enjoyed the story itself - its shows that one has to know how to give a power to the others, even if others are his family and how it can turn out if its done not in a right way - something to be learned even in these times.Overall, ""Ran"" is a pure classic. Superbly made with themes that done age - this is sure must see for everyone who appreciate great cinema.",Ran
25,clanciai,King Lear turned into a monumental epic in Japanese,10,11 July 2020,"There is nothing wrong with treating Shakespeare at large with any licence, which Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece is a clear evidence of. He sticks mainly to only the skeleton of the play and makes as many deviations as possible, the most remarkable and successful being to let the fool stay on with King Lear throughout the drama to the bitter end, while in the play he is lost half way without an explanation. Instead of troublesome daughters there are troublesome sons, and the youngest proves to be the only true and correct one of them, like Cordelia, and meets with a similar fate but more militarily. In comparison with his earlier masterpiece ""Kagemusha"" there are less horses here and less beautiful music, while the main character of the film with its many devastating battles and massacres is rather apocalyptic, with some marvellous contrasts to the general doom, especially by the female interaction and the blind flutist, who makes something of a frontispiece and symbolic figurehead to the entire epic, adding some profound symbolism. Above all, Tatsuya Nakadai as the troubled old king is the best and most convincing Lear type I have ever seen, transcending even Laurence Olivier's characterization by mere physical acting without speech - his finest part is when he sits totally unmoved while everything around him is burning in the apocalyptic siege of the castle after the first hour. His long white hair, his wild eyes, his impersonation of the ultimate despair by mere movements and expressions - is enough to make this film only for his sake one of the most outstanding and indispensable films in all history - and it was Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece, made when he himself was 75 years old.",Ran
26,briancham1994,Epic but drags on too long,7,23 September 2021,"One of Kurosawa's later films shows his mastery of the samurai film. As he demonstrates across his career, the direction of epic battle scenes is definitely his strength. This time, instead of instilling a sense of heroism or justice, it feels like senseless bloodshed, with important characters killed off unceremoniously or stumbling around in a daze. The character drama that underlies this sad, showing the futility of conflict when driven only by personal ambition. The real standout here is the portrayal of Lady Kaede who really is a demon, instigating all the chaos around her for personal revenge. However, the film does drag on at times, involving too many characters. At least the jester was funny.",Ran
27,tomgillespie2002,Quite simply one of the finest films ever made,10,11 March 2015,"Ten years in the making, Akira Kurosawa's Ran took it's toll on director Akira Kurosawa. Following a highly successful career in the 1950's and 60's, Kurosawa fell out of favour with modern audiences and producers due to his traditional film-making styles and topics. Japan had experienced it's own New Wave, where directors used innovative techniques to look forward, rather than looking back. Eventually backed by Sidney Lumet, Kurosawa developed his labour of love, based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and made Kagemusha (1980) - a 'warm-up' for Ran - while developing the project. He storyboarded every scene with beautiful artwork, ensured that every costume was made by hand, and even built a castle to torch it down for the movie. On top of this, his wife passed away during filming (Kurosawa took only one day off work to mourn), and by the film's completion, Kurosawa was almost completely blind.Such dedication and rigorous planning doesn't always work out, but Ran is Kurosawa's final masterpiece. The term 'epic' is thrown around far too often these days, but if one film could really be labelled as epic, it is Ran. Epic in scale, length and scope, it's a complex, exciting and bloody movie, capturing the tragedy of Shakespeare's play, and invigorating with it's Machiavellian intrigue. The ageing warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) decides to pass his throne to his eldest son Taro (Akira Terao) so he can spend his remaining years in peace. To his other sons, Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and the youngest Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), he leaves two large castles. Saburu objects, calling the decision folly and foreseeing instability, and is banished by his father for his loyalty.Before Taro's backside has warmed his new throne, his wife Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) is whispering doubts into his ear. With Hidetora still residing in the castle, Lady Kaede tells Taro that his crown is hollow and his men will never earn his respect until his father is removed. After Hidetora kills one of Jiro's men who was about to kill his fool Kyoami (Funeral Parade of Roses' (1964) Pita), Jiro banishes his father, who then seeks refuge with Jiro. But Jiro has plans of his own, and seeing Taro as a weak leader, pretends to side with Taro in preparation for a future betrayal, and also sends Hidetora packing. With nowhere to turn, the broken and increasingly senile old man wanders to the ruins of a castle he conquered in his warmongering days. But when Saburo hears of his brothers' betrayal and Lady Kaede's scheming, war begins to brew.Kurosawa's precise planning pays off, as Ran is a gorgeous canvas of colours and scenery, to the extent that any scene could be paused, printed and hung on the wall as a piece of art. The costumes, a sumptuous blend of red's and yellow's, bring the battle scenes to life. Bodies litter the ground, streaming with bright red blood that give the movie a grim and apocalyptic feel, and when juxtaposed with Hidetora's mental decline, makes it feel like the world is literally crumbling around him. The acting is surprisingly subtle and subdued, especially when compared to Kurosawa's earlier works. Nakadai is outstanding as the lost old man, though he is helped by some impressive make-up, but the film belongs to Harada, whose ruthless conniving truly embodies Shakespeare's text. Quite simply one of the finest films ever made.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Ran
28,Thanos_Alfie,Old time classic...,8,5 February 2015,"""Ran"" is an action movie in which we watch an old lord who decides to step aside to make room for the younger blood of his three sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo. His only wish is to be like a guest in his own castles for his final years. The older brothers support their father's decision but the younger one does not and he attempts to warn him not to take this decision because it will not be as good as he thinks not only for the future of the kingdom but also for the future of the family.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found brilliant and of course the direction of this movie which made by Akira Kurosawa was simply outstanding for one more time. I also liked this movie because of the messages that wants to pass and because this movie wants to has an impact to the audience after they watching of it. About the interpretations it has to be mentioned the interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai who played as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and he was really good at it, equally good was the interpretation of Daisuke Ryû who played as Saburo Naotora Ichimonji, and also Akira Terao's who played as Taro Takatora Ichimonji.Lastly I have to say that ""Ran"" is a masterpiece movie and it really worth everybody to watch it, it has much of suspense and action and of course war and all of that are being combined really good with drama. I also believe that this movie makes you understand better many things such as how you have to think and be careful for the future and of your decisions about it.

29,Red-125,Kurosawa's masterpiece,10,4 October 2010,"Ran (1985) written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, is one of the great movies of all time. I saw it when it was first released, and just saw it again when it was shown locally. It's one of those films that gets even better on a second viewing.This movie has been billed as the ""Japanese King Lear,"" and that's fairly accurate. (However, the three children are sons in this version, not daughters.) However, in my opinion, the film is just as close to Shakespeare's ""Macbeth,"" because much of the plot pivots around the actions of Lady Kaede, the wife of one of the sons.Lady Kaede, played by the renowned actor Mieko Harada, is intelligent, beautiful, and completely devoid of fear or kindness. She has a goal and she pursues it relentlessly throughout the film. It's only at the end that we understand the goal and her actions in pursuit of it.If you're a movie fan, you simply have to see Ran. It works much better on the large screen. (We were fortunate to see it at the excellent Dryden Theatre at Eastman House in Rochester.) However, if the only way to see it is on DVD, go with that. Just don't miss it!",Ran
30,TheMovieDiorama,Ran is Akira Kurosawa's last epic.,9,2 March 2018,"The man was a genius when it came to directing these long Japanese war epics and Ran is no different. This is Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear, a play that unfortunately I did not study. The plot consists of Lord Hidetora abdicating his empire and splitting the kingdom between his three sons, who each want to have total control. And so many castles are raided and many horseback battles are conceived. Whatever the scene, everything was filmed to perfection. I just adore Kurosawa's style, he doesn't rush a single scene. Leave a castle burning for 30 seconds, watch a man run through a field for 30 seconds or even look at the sky for 30 seconds. In theory, I should be bored...but his artistic integrity and majestic style is a sight to behold. What resonated with me the most was the screenplay, also by Kurosawa. Several lines of dialogue felt like Shakespeare and it's admirable to see an influential film maker be...well...influenced by another famous writer. Scenes where Hidetora descends into madness are great examples of this. Tatsuya Nakadai, who portrayed Hidetora, was once again outstanding. This equals his role from Kagemusha, it was an emotive and poignant portrayal of a father who has been betrayed by his children. The battle scenes were masterful work, hundreds of extras in clan attire definitely filled up the screen with contrasting colours. The costume and production design were yet again wonderful to look at. I do love me the traditional Japanese environment that Kurosawa captures with ease. Lady Kaeda though, was the manifestation of evil...her manipulative skills were fascinating to watch. This leads me to my only problem, which is that none of the major characters are likeable, even Hidetora had issues. So I struggled to become emotionally invested in these characters. However, the purpose of this iteration was to explore themes of betrayal and insanity, Kurosawa conveyed them to technical perfection. Not a complete masterpiece, but extremely close to being one.",Ran
31,SAMTHEBESTEST,Another fantastic Shakespeare adaption but Akira Kurosawa is better with Originals.,7,29 August 2020,"Ran (1985) :
Brief Review -Another fantastic Shakespeare adaption but Akira Kurosawa is better with Originals. This was 2nd Shakespeare adaption for legendary director Kurosawa and the script was certain to fetch critical acclaim but was it enough in mainstream filmmaking? Ran is about 160 minutes long and somewhere this thing makes it a strict one take viewing experience. I can't watch this film multiple times on TV or anywhere with breaks and neither i think i can watch it again in one take without forwarding once. In Medieval Japan, an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. However, he vastly underestimates how the new-found power will corrupt them and cause them to turn on each other...and him. The family battle of reign and crown is very much predictable but never loses sense and artistic values. What i feel about adapting something is either you should try and modify it or make the copy paste look so good that people will find no difference at all and you'll be saved. From what i have seen in Kurosawa's filmography, i found his original films more interesting and more classical than both the Shakespeare adaptions. It could be because i knew the story already or may be i didn't find it Highly interesting, glueing and engaged. Ran doesn't go offtrack, it stays on its way and runs smoothly till the destination. The only problems are long runtime and typical use of big Canvas. The performances from all the cast members are good but only Tatsuya Nakadai remains in mind. Background score and Cinematography are suitable to the theme and the era in which the film is set. Agressive use of violence and battle scenes look fine sometimes but not everytime. Kurosawa directs another gem but just because of outdated melodrama and lack of freshness, Ran didn't make it to the my list of Classics. Nevertheless, a Fantastic Adaption any day.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Ran
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Deep and personal Kurosawa masterwork.,10,16 August 2009,"The height of Akira Kurosawa's career as a masterful Japanese filmmaker might have been in the '50s with ""Roshomon"" and the epic ""Seven Samurai,"" but ""Ran"" represents a consummation of sorts in the director's career and lifetime. At age 75, Kurosawa puts his own style into Shakespeare's ""King Lear,"" the descent of a once great king into utter senility, and the result is a deeply personal and tragic film of great beauty and wisdom.His second Shakespeare samurai adaptation, (after ""Throne of Blood"" in 1957, which drew on ""MacBeth"") Kurosawa tells the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji a famous, revered and aging ruler in feudal Japan who after a bad dream is stirred into abdicating his throne to his sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo. He gives full control to his eldest, Taro, though his youngest, Saburo, tells him it's a horrible idea and as a result gets banished. Sure enough, Hidetora is denied the respect of Taro when he takes power and wanders off in search of the son he exiled to seek redemption as the elder brothers shred apart his kingdom in attempt to have it all to themselves.""Ran"" is a beautiful film despite the Shakespearian tragedy. Filmed in Kurosawa's style of three simultaneously rolling stationary cameras, it rarely gets in close to the scene and appears to have the style of much older films, save the color. Kurosawa, who's known for painting his story boards, brings this contemporary abstract color to the film by using the three primary colors (yellow, red and blue) to represent the three sons (their respective armies all wear those colors.) The colors are bright and show the division between the brothers -- each distinct yet capable of mixing. Even the blood is bright red paint as opposed to anything more realistic, suggesting how unnecessary the bloodshed is.The film borrows a lot of Japanese tradition in telling a Western story, which in the past always seems to work well. Borrowing on traditions of Noh theatre, allusions to animals like the treacherous fox and the make-up on Hidetora (frequent Kurosawa collaborator Tatsuya Nakadai) is suggestive of Noh techniques that resemble iconic masks that represent characters with certain qualities. Nakadai excellently uses the facial expressions so crucial to Japanese theatre in his incredible portrayal of Hidetora as he goes from confident and powerful to completely lost.It's a meaningful story for Kurosawa to tell at this point in his career, having much of his films in the '60s and '70s pass by unnoticed and in that time attempt to take his own life. Kurosawa takes his bleak look at human nature with ""Ran,"" using weather like always to show the coming storm of bloodshed and tragedy. ""I am lost ..."" Hidetora says as they wander about, and Kyoami the fool replies ""such is the human condition."" It's apparent where the story will go and Kurosawa delivers it as only a master can.",Ran

34,Anonymous_Maxine,"Sometimes, given sufficient objectives, even the people who are closer to you than anyone else can turn against you.",10,7 August 2001,"In another lengthy samurai epic, Akira Kurosawa approaches the boundaries between family members and the damaging affects of one of his rather common themes - reckless ambition. This is very clearly a Kurosawa film, a respectable trait that is most clear in the cinematography, in which Kurosawa uses many extensive shots with little to no camera movement, as well as the common natural setting, characterized by the far-reaching landscapes of sweeping hillsides. Ran has a fascinating plot about an aging King who considers passing on his empire to his three sons. Lord Hidetora is well into his 70s (maybe Kurosawa saw part of himself in this character?), and he addresses the fact that he cannot go on ruling forever, despite the fact that he fought for his empire for over 50 years. His youngest son disagrees with his proposition of passing on leadership yet maintaining much of his control, yet Hidetora nonetheless divides his kingdom into three parts to his sons, hoping that they will remain allies. As an incentive, he demonstrates with arrows that a single one can be broken easily, but three arrows together cannot be broken as easily. The three sons, Taro, Jiro, and Saburo do not agree with Hidetora's philosophy and, as new leaders of their respective portions of Lord Hidetora's kingdom, they soon begin to fight each other for full leadership. Hidetora is attacked by his own sons and cast out of the kingdom, left to wander hopelessly from castle to castle with no one but his goofy jester at his side, who stays with the Lord entirely out of duty to him. One of Hidetora's three sons eventually returns and tries to patch up their damaged relationship, but before they can do that, he gets killed and Hidetora is left alone again, and the empire that he worked for during most of his life is left in ruins. As is also common in Kurosawa's films, there are a lot of interesting and significant characters in the film that play a substantial role in the story. When we first meet Lady Kaede, the woman who was married to Taro but then forced her way into marriage with his younger brother Jiro (the new Lord) upon Taro's death, she is holding a knife to Lord Jiro, threatening him with blackmail if he does not accept her as his wife. The first thing that makes her interesting is that her objective in marrying Jiro is to ensure herself a comfortable life, and so she can avoid fading into obscurity as the widow of a past Lord. Her blackmail threat has a lot of damaging potential for Jiro, and he accepts her as his wife. From the very start of her role in the film, her ultimate goal was to bring about the downfall of the kingdom in order to avenge her family who had been killed when Lord Hidetora was in power. This is not expected or even hinted at previously in the film, and it gives her character much more depth.There is some great irony in Ran that occurs after Lord Hidetora is banished and is left wandering the endless plains. He and his jester come across a run-down wooden shack at the foot of a hillside, and they approach it, asking for help and shelter. The occupant, after explaining that his home is too poor to offer any shelter, turns out to be a man who, as a boy, had had his eyes gouged out under the orders of Lord Hidetora in exchange for sparing his life. Once the jester and Hidetora are inside, the man explains that he will offer hospitality in the only way that Hidetora left him able, he will play them music on his flute. In this scene, Hidetora is confronted with the terrible suffering which he once imposed, and it is horribly ironic that he is forced to take shelter from someone that he once devastatingly mutilated without a second thought. In Ran, as was also the case in Kagemusha, which is a very similar film in time period and content, Kurosawa again employs a subtler style of directing. Again, he focuses more on the story than on cinematic trickery, and with spectacular results. The extensive use of the motionless camera is stunningly effective, but he also uses it in a different way here. Ran opens with a series of stationary shots of a group of horses standing majestically with their riders on the top of a flowing hillside. Virtually the exact same image is shown from a fairly wide variety of different angles and distances, indicating the vastness of the plains and the power that these characters hold (or will soon hold) over them. Again, a musical score is entirely absent throughout the vast majority of the film, and the same lengthy scenes are employed to a large extent to communicate the story of the film. An example of one of these exceedingly long takes can be seen early in the film when Lord Hidetora first announces his what he intends to do with the leadership of his kingdom. The ending of Ran is definitely realistic, for many reasons. There are no myths perpetuated by it; close family members do not always stand together, even the noblest intentions are not always realized, and no one lives happily ever after. Ran is the story of a man in a position of power who makes a trusting decision that backfires devastatingly, and the ensuing madness is not altered to make way for a happy ending. It seems that Kurosawa was trying to capture the militarily charged atmosphere that is present in times of war, and the things mentioned above are some of the many efforts he made to make it all as real as possible, even at the expense of the audience's emotions.",Ran
35,jzappa,Great Seclusively Japanese Film,10,16 February 2008,"No matter how much I rave about the 1970s being the heart of change for the better for the movies and how the bar was set even higher for the production values and creative eye of cinema, it was in 1985 when Akira Kurosawa, not at all weather-beaten at age 75 with Ran, his 28th film, forcibly molded the standards of cinematic approach, which he'd already done many times through his career before that time. In Ran, he emboldens colors, ambient sound, and the reality of violence, and when the gloomy music score plays, the ambient sound disappears and the music becomes the hum of the action.The film, indeed inspired by Shakespeare's King Lear, features acting ripe with what appears to be detaching Shakespearean countenance, overacting, which to many can thus deflate the potential effect of Kurosawa's vision. However, the choice for Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Great Lord Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who plays the vindictive Lady Kaede, to use such old-fashioned acting techniques is not based on Shakespearean training but the influence of classical Japanese musical drama theater, exemplified in the heavy, ghost-like makeup worn by Nakadai, which resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh theater performers, along with his body language, long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. Being a very concentratedly cultural adaptation, Ran uses these dramatized aspects of the two characters to emphasize their ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures.The story itself, which is said to be a blend of King Lear and the legends of Mori Motonari, a 16th century daimyo, neither of which I have read, very tightly and carefully unravels and unfolds very present, glaring moral insights.",Ran
36,Vartiainen,Shakespeare would be proud,9,30 June 2017,"Akira Kurosawa returns to Shakespeare in this loose adaptation of King Lear that also incorporates elements from the legends of the daimyō Mōri Motonari. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that those two sources are eerily similar. An aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai) that has decided to retire and hand over the three great castles he has conquered during his bloody reign to his three sons, with the oldest named his successor and the head of the great house. But almost immediately the sons begin arguing among one another and soon the warlord finds himself dethroned and wandering the battlefields of the war his sons are waging.Quite like with his previous Shakespeare adaptation, Throne of Blood, Kurosawa delves deep into man's corruptibility and the taint of power in this film. Many of his films are at least somewhat heroic in nature and tone. Whereas the protagonist of this film, the warlord, is anything but. We learn throughout the course of the film that his life is a long tale of conquest, beaten down enemies, blood, fire and destruction. Yet Kurosawa achieves the very hard task of making him sympathetic despite all that. He obviously loves his sons and his anguish at seeing his life's work torn down in a matter of days is real and jarring.Perhaps it could even be said that his character is reflected in his sons. There's the oldest, the one with the power, pride and possessions, but who is brought low by those closest to him and stands on feet of clay. There's the schemer, the one willing to commit atrocities to get what he wants. And there's the youngest, who's the most driven by the love he has for his family, but who's also the one with the most difficulties in surviving the war-torn realm they live in.The film is also massive in scope, budget and length. Its themes are deep, its running time is closer to three hours and its story is a humongous five act monstrosity. It was also the most expensive Japanese film ever made back then and the money is definitely on the screen. Hundreds of soldiers at once on display, all of them decked in armour. Entire castles built and then destroyed. Lavish costumes, ruins and locations. I don't think I've seen a movie with this much handcraft on the screen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And this predates those films by almost two decades.Yet the film is always gripping, always interesting and endlessly fascinating. It's called one of Kurosawa's finest, and yeah, I can see why.",Ran
37,jamesrupert2014,Outstanding film from the end of a legendary director's career,9,25 November 2020,"In this jidaigeki version of 'King Lear', an aging Warlord steps down after dividing control of his fiefdom between his three sons, only to discover loyalty and honour are a distant second to ambition and power. The film is the last, and one of the best, of the 'historical' dramas from director Akira Kurosawa. The production is outstanding, with beautiful expansive cinematography, excellent set design, and fabulous costumes (the film's only Academy Award win). The cast is great although Lord Hidetora Ichimonji begins to look a bit theatrical as he slides towards madness and Tatsuya Nakadai overplays the character at times. Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede, who oozes Machiavellian menace as she ruthlessly manipulates Hidetora's hapless middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu). The film moves at a faster pace than Kagemusha (1980), Kurosawa's previous jidaigeki and the battle scenes are epic and spectacular, with armies wearing brightly coloured armour and flying brightly coloured banners clashing like a game of 'Risk' brought to life. The stunt work is also excellent, especially the horsemanship in the ill-fated cavalry charges. All in all, one of the best films from the legendary Japanese director and a fitting 'swan song' to his output of historical dramas.",Ran
38,freemantle_uk,"A film that truly lives up to the word ""Epic""",8,11 July 2014,"Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest filmmakers ever and his last epic film Ran is often considered one of his best, an adaptation of King Lear. Ran is a visually striking, thematic epic that Kurosawa's fan will love. Ran is glorious to look at, having fantastic colours, costumes and cinematography of the Japanese plains and mountains. The characters are rich, major and minor as well defined and have a role to play with their character dynamic. Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora is a character who goes through the ringer as he descends into madness, face all his sins when he rose to power and goes into a mental and physical void as he ends up in a wasteland. The battle of Third Castle was a terrific sequence as a small force are in a last stand against massive army attacks, using arrows and muskets. It was beautifully shot battle, showing the scale of the army and showing the carriage as Hidetora's mind cracks.A theme of power corrupts as Hidetora seek power as his sons want to have complete control of the land. All the characters have their own agendas and the only ones who are loyal to Hidetora are the ones he rejected. All the characters in the power struggle are all trying to play one against the other.Kurosawa direction is superb, a great looking film and he allowed scenes to play out in long takes, allowing the drama to play out and adds to the theatrical nature of the acting and story. Kurosawa even uses the weather to great effect to enhance the emotion and turmoil the characters and world suffers, much like Rashomon and Throne of Blood.Ran is typical Kurosawa.",Ran
39,dee.reid,A modern-day Akira Kurosawa masterpiece,10,9 July 2012,"Late Japanese master of cinema Akira Kurosawa has many masterpieces to his name - ""Seven Samurai"" (1954) (my personal favorite), ""Rashomon"" (1950), ""Yojimbo"" (1961), ""Throne of Blood"" (1957), ""Kagemusha"" (1980) and the film I'm commenting on here, 1985's ""Ran."" Having seen this movie in its entirety for the first time earlier today, I'm simply amazed by the epic scale of the picture, the performances, the use of color and imagery (by Emi Wada), and Kurosawa's master direction.""Ran"" is a unique collaboration between Japan and France. ""Ran"" (which means ""revolt,"" ""chaos,"" or ""fury"" in Japanese) is Kurosawa's epic adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy ""King Lear,"" and surrounds the aging 16-century Japanese warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) after he unwisely decides to give up control of his kingdom to his three sons - Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu) - with the land divided up equally amongst them. Hidetora falls prey to the false flattery bestowed upon his by two oldest sons - Taro and Jiro - but angrily banishes his youngest child Saburo when he speaks the truth about the insanity of his father's actions. Madness, bloodshed, betrayal, and all-out war soon follow.Kurosawa is by far the greatest foreign director I've ever encountered in my 26-and-a-half years on this planet. I've already mentioned a number of pictures that I've seen and consider to be classics, not just of Japanese cinema, but of all films (I consider ""Seven Samurai"" to be the greatest foreign-language picture I've ever seen). What makes ""Ran"" so powerful is its strong performances, inventive use of color and costumes (which won an Oscar at the Academy Awards for 1985 for costume designer Emi Wada) and having looked at the picture, there's a certain air of timelessness to it: it feels like it could have been made decades ago back in the 1960s, yet it's only 27-years-old! (This last statement could be because of the restored audio and picture on the Blu-ray edition of this film, from which this comment is based.)The film also plays on two common themes in Kurosawa's work, the battle between reality vs. fantasy (the flattery of Taro and Jiro to their father for his decision, and the madness Hidetora soon falls into), and the lust for power (and the bloodshed that ensues as the three newly crowned warlords battle each other for ultimate control of the land). Perhaps is this no better seen here than in ""Ran.""This is another Akira Kurosawa masterpiece to behold!10/10",Ran
40,mjneu59,unforgettable samurai Shakespeare,9,29 December 2010,"Sitting through three hours of Shakespeare transposed to a feudal Japanese setting might be enough to test the endurance of many viewers, but Akira Kurosawa's colorful reading of 'King Lear' offers a bold (and, at times, barbaric) spectacle well worth the effort, and not soon forgotten. The music of Shakespeare's language suffers in translation, but the scenario is faithful to its source, filling the screen with operatic intrigues, skullduggery, vendettas, and a Götterdämmerung climax that leaves just about every character dead. Like other Kurosawa films it takes a while to work up any momentum, requiring several long, static dialogue scenes to establish the conflicts between an aging warlord and his (thankfully color-coded) sons (plus one totally ruthless daughter-in-law). But once underway the story builds into an exciting, impressive, and exhausting melodrama far removed from its humble stage origins.",Ran
41,MissSimonetta,Everyone has their reasons - Kurosawa revisits Shakespeare,10,7 February 2016,"It is not uncommon for an artist's output to wane a little in age. Not so with Akira Kurosawa. Even in his late period, his work continued to be inspired and masterful. Ran (1985) is the most regarded of these late works, a ravishingly beautiful and yet bleak adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear.The Noh-influenced performances and choice to transpose Willy Shakes to 16th century Japan recall Kurosawa's earlier Throne of Blood (1958), which told the story of Macbeth; however, this film is far more downbeat. In Throne of Blood, the tyrant-protagonist is taken down by the people. Though the cycle of violence will go on as long as greed and ambition live within mankind, there is hope that they will always be taken down. But here? Ran is so much more tragic in its view of people and the human condition.As Renoir once said, everyone has their reasons. Here, there really aren't any white or black hats. The treacherous Lady Kaede is a victim of Lord Hideotara, who had killed her entire family. The tragic Hideotora has killed many innocents in his quest for power, yet we still pity his fate and ultimate inability to live peacefully with his sons in his advanced years.From the boar hunt in the beginning to the film's haunting closing image of the blind man on the edge of a cliff, Ran is a nearly three hour movie that doesn't feel its length for a moment. It is perhaps Kurosawa's final bonafide masterpiece, but that is arguable. It's much harder to argue this one is anything less than great.",Ran

43,kluseba,Failure at the highest level,4,17 July 2012,"This movie came as a big disappointment to me. I really adore Japanese culture and history and I am a big fan of Asian cinema. I was looking forward to see a film that is considered as a masterpiece by many and has risen to world wide fame.I was surprised to see so many flaws in this film that I don't even know where to start. First of all, the movie is far too long and lacks of fluidity. The story is extremely predictable and develops no tension at all. The script is very poor and unoriginal. It steals several ideas from many other theatre plays and movies. One always feels that one has seen the same story elsewhere before and in a much better way. The beginning is overlong and should have been shortened. The middle part with the scenes in the field and the destroyed castle include many lengths. The ending is not well told and finishes too abruptly on the other side.The battle scenes are a complete fail. We see a shot of soldiers shooting in a forest. In the next shot, we see five soldiers yelling and falling from the horses to die on the ground. Repeat the two shots five times and this is what the battle scenes of this movie are like. There is no action, no aesthetic and no emotion in those scenes. It rather looks like a chess game than a true battle.The dialogues are amongst the poorest ones I have ever witnessed in cinema and I have seen thousand of movies. They are extremely wooden and sometimes so ridiculous that I had to laugh out hard. The scenes including the arrogant, philosophical and schizophrenic fool are annoying. When the old lord gets insane and just always says the same couple of sentences throughout the second half of the movie and shares many scenes with the fool, the whole thing looks like a parody in form of an old fashioned theatre play for kids. Some intellectual people will now talk about the irony that the fool always tells the truth and switches roles with his master and that the poor old man saved the fool and that this action started all the intrigues but this is no excuse for so many poor and repetitive dialogues.The characters are not credible. The movie tries to include many hints at traditional Japanese culture but these elements are exaggerated and don't seem authentic at all to me. The role of the fool that insults everybody around him but stays extremely faithful to his old master once he has gone insane is ridiculous. A man that shows this kind of disrespect would have been executed in traditional Japan. A woman like Lady Kaede would have never been so successful with her predictable intrigues. Any credible husband or brother-in-law would have given an order to execute her. The fact that Lady Sue could easily escape from the castle and go to her brother is not credible at all even if she got help. One would have followed and killed her and the traitor that refuses to obey his master and its sister-in-law would have been executed, too. It also seems strange to me that the lord's adviser finally kills Lady Kaede without getting the order by his superior while the lord stands next to him and doesn't react. I'm not an expert of Japanese history but from what I have seen from other movies, read from several books, known from history lessons and heard from Japanese that I could meet, many of these scenes don't seem realistic to me at all if I think about the severe code of honour of this country.After so many negative aspects, let's mention some positive things. Even though the characters aren't credible and the dialogues are wooden, it's not the mistake by the actors but by the writer and director. The acting itself is well executed and should be praised. It's the only thing that kept me watching this flick until the end. To give you an example, the interpretation of Lady Kaede or the annoying fool are well done from an objective point of view.At the time of its creation, this movie was Japan's most expensive production ever. Akira Korusawa was a big name and he got some good connections. You can see this by the inclusion of many supportive actors, excellent settings and especially many valuable costumes that are created with much detail. The film is quite colourful and beautiful to watch. Only the camera cuts are stiff and some potential is wasted there.Concerning the story, even though the whole thing is predictable, some of the intrigues are still well done. After a weak start and before a weaker second half of the movie, we have around forty-five minutes or so that are really entertaining and have some plot development. This is the strongest part of the movie.In the end, there are some positive points to mention but the weaker ones are in majority. It's definitely not the mistake of the costume makers, the actors or the light and sound engineers that do an almost flawless job. It's the fault of the poor writers and the headless director. Shame on you, Mister Akira Korusawa. Even a big name can't save this film that must be considered as a failure at the highest level. It's not the worst thing I have seen but still below average. I definitely don't recommend this movie to anybody apart of fans of gorgeous costumes and old fashioned theatre plays.",Ran

45,myriamlenys,"Superb take on Shakespeare's ""King Lear""",10,19 September 2019,"A Japanse lord has risen to power through many years of warfare and intrigue. Now an old man, he decides to divide his domains among his three sons. In the process, he quarrels with the youngest son, who is the only one sane and bold enough to tell his progenitor the truth, to wit that this is a singularly misguided plan. Slowly but surely the family will rip itself apart, amidst treachery and slaughter...Kurosawa transports Shakespeare's tragedy to feudal Japan. In doing so he re-arranges and re-adapts the story liberally : the protagonist, for instance, becomes an old samurai warlord with a whole household of openly acknowledged concubines. There is also a bitter joke which involves a fox head and which allows for a bit of folklore about beautiful shape-changing women who set out to beguile unsuspecting men. The move to feudal Japan works very well, for a variety of reasons. To begin with, this backdrop preserves the great themes of class, power, prestige. Secondly, the viewer is immersed in a rich and complex culture which can produce extremes both of violence and of beauty, often at the same time. (Some of the movie's costumes, especially the aristocratic ones, are so exquisite that they deserve a fashion museum of their own.)This is an epic movie with an exceptional visual grandeur. It is also a deeply pessimistic movie. ""Ran"" deals not just with the folly of a single man or a single family : it deals with the folly of Mankind, which could live peacefully on a generous and abundant Earth but prefers killing and looting...Much recommended.

47,Steffi_P,"""Barren of loyalty and feeling""",9,19 March 2011,"Akira Kurosawa is renowned both in the west and at home as one of the world's finest filmmakers, in large part thanks to his many historical pictures. Made towards the end of his career, Ran is the last in a long line of Kurosawa features set amid the chaos of Japan's feudal past. But this time around there are none of the downtrodden samurai and gnarly-toothed peasants so familiar from his 1950s classics. Ran is not an intimate human portrait as Rashomon, Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress were. This is a vast epic of battles and warlords, the bloody historical backdrop against which those earlier, small-scale stories would have taken place.Kurosawa himself was now in a very different phase in his career. He keeps the camera back from the action, a cold and objective eye. His however is still very much a cinema based around movement, rhythm and tone. Take the opening shots over which the credits are played, picture-postcard tableaux of horsemen, the occasional turn of a head or flick of a tail the only thing to tell these are not stills. Set to the haunting whistle of a Japanese reed flute, it's a perfectionist evocation of the calm before the storm. Throughout the picture staging, pacing, colour and sound are all precisely tuned to the needs of the scene. Often a shot will be held for longer than strictly necessary purely for the sake of rhythmic balance (Kurosawa did his own editing). But it's not all about aesthetics. Some of the artier looking shots also serve to give the story more depth, such as the attention-grabbing close-up of the helmet when Kaede seduces Jiro, which visually corresponds to Hidetora's grass ""crown"" in the following scene, the comparison between the two reminding us how great the shift in power has been.The acting in Ran is as much a matter of stylisation as the direction. Taking inspiration from Noh (a Japanese theatre tradition comparable to opera) lead man Tatsuya Nakadai makes exaggerated gesture of even the most normal action, for example wiping his fingers clean with military snap after signing the document that relinquishes his power. It's not a realistic or emotive way of performing but it fits in with the tone of the whole piece. And as with a stage production, the focus here is much more on figures than faces. Of the other cast members Mieko Harada is particularly good as Lady Kaede. She has a wonderful wavering voice like one of the reed flutes prevalent in the score, and is deeply expressive. It's great fun to see the exuberant stage performer Peter playing the fool, and also Hitoshi Ueki (Lord Fujimaki), a popular comic actor who seems to me like a Japanese Clive Swift.For all its stylistic precision, Ran can make for difficult viewing, not because of its length or cultural barriers, but because of its utter bleakness. It is not just in scope that it differs from the Kurosawa pictures of previous decades, it also foregoes the heart and humanism that made those earlier affairs so affecting. Ran is one of the most aesthetically beautiful films ever made, and is certainly a powerful commentary on the war-torn chaos of the twentieth century, but it seems slightly sad that Kurosawa has rejected making an emotional connection with his audience.",Ran

I watched the remastered UHD version and I was blown away with the visuals.Sadly I could only watch the dubbed version and that might be another reason why I couldn't follow this film clearly .I really struggled to understand who was who and what was happening and why and I put that purely down to my aversion to Shakespeare.

50,Samiam3,Strong but Sloooooooowwww,7,5 August 2009,"I am not certain, but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually, It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography, and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie, and you also need to understand the context of the story.Ran is Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear, which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy. The premise is identical, revolving around an old monarch who is ruined by the corruption of his sons, after he gives them power and authority. (In King Lear, they were daughters, not sons, of course.) Ran starts and ends strongly, but the problem comes down to a huge, plodding middle section. This part of the film will really test your attention span. Kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens, because he wants to evoke one single emotion...isolation. He places his principal character (and a couple of others) in the middle of nowhere, with no story progression, music, or major dialog. There are perhaps one (or even two) too many similarly grim scenes.The battles scenes are the biggest in Kurosawa's forty year body of work. Not only do they feature swords and spears but guns, cannons, and a cast of thousands. The interesting thing about those scenes is that Kurosawa, doesn't intend them to be rousing or exciting. Instead, there is a strange emotional feeling generated. The most memorable part of Ran is the very last sequence, which is visually brilliant and really disturbing. He makes a metaphor about the frailty of humanity by showing a blind man in a very particular place.Ran will leave you thinking long and hard. I have not seen a film like it and I don't think I ever will. It is not my favorite Kurosawa, but it is very much worth watching.",Ran

53,Blueghost,Masterpiece.,10,22 February 2011,"What can anyone say that hasn't been said already about this film? It's a commercial release of one of the most artistic plays ever, and rendered by the most artistically minded film maker in the history of cinema. Who could create such a thing?I speak of none other than the magnificent Akira Kurosawa, the grand master of all film making, and the epitome of his work in the samurai genre, ""RAN"".""RAN"" explores the turmoil caused by the child who knows only himself, and dismisses all that he should hold dear and valuable. But our main protagonist Hidetora raised his children on the values of unbridled warfare; how to betray a friend, turn him into an enemy, and conquer him ruthlessly. Yet he is utterly shocked when his own offspring treat him thus, and sent into a psychosis from which only a loved one can retrieve him.Edward De'Vere's play focused on three daughters who use their wiles to manipulate and scheme against one another, and thus inflict and strike the same madness in their father. But Kurosawa takes the story and give it a new bent by turning the daughters into sons for the would be Shogun of Japan. This adds a new twist, and gives more than just the usual visual hyperbole that many remakes of films do to their predecessors by actually adding to the story material. The manipulation is still there, but it is the men who are driven by a lust for power and wealth, the one thing they inherited from their father.Note the color schemes of the sons. Note the eldest in Gold, his ascendancy to the family throne. The second son shows Red, and his thirst to replace his eldest brother. The third son, the youngest, donned in blue, and it is the color that comes forth at the end when Hidetora regains himself, and as we also look up at the sky with the characters, and ask the gods why they are so cruel. Indeed, what hath god wrought upon this segment of feudal Japan? A land where its borders are set apart from anything tangible we know about that period in Japan's history. It is truly an imaginary tale, but one fraught with the historic realities of those striving for dominance in a system that knew only swords and plowshares.But it is not the men who are the only samurai. There is indeed a woman who takes on the spiritual semblance of the vampire, and drives the story forward to render justice for her family, now lost to Hidetora's exploits. She is perhaps a samurai above all the others.It is a slow film. It is a grande film. It is spectacle mixed with the frailties and cruelties and, at the end, devotions of the human heart. We see the splash and splendor of the colors, the utter destruction of a society that has put faith in military-wit and lost its heart and soul. We see one disaster follow another, and we also see those who come in to assist the true, and those that come into to clean the chaos that has reigned. Note the old lord in Act Three whose forces are in white. They look down with smiles and applaud the efforts below of those they love. Note the color of the army that assails the Red uniformed forces of the angry second son.Artistry encapsulated.Now, technically it is supremely shot, there isn't too much to criticize here save for one or two SFX shots. The scope and scale of the production is enormous. And for all of the spectacle presented in this epic, it does not lose its intimacy. We see moments of passion, moments of truth, moments of betrayal and moments of solitude. Shot composition and lens selection does not miss a beat. Whether we're looking at a long shot, or a close-up. There is of course the famous montage battle sequence that many have tried to duplicate, but have never achieved. Married to some incredible music accentuating the segment, we see cinematography at its best.This is a long film. It is a long epic film made for and by a Japanese film maker, but a film that can touch all on an emotional level. It will try the patience of the average viewer, particularly younger viewers, but if you're a film aficionado, then this film is for you.Watch and enjoy.ADDENUDM; Oh wow, apparently three prostitutes didn't like my review.

54,Lady_Targaryen,King Lear adaptation..and Great!:),10,12 September 2005,"Usually, I don't write comments of movies that have too many reviews. But this one is so good, that I decided to break this rule. Ran is an adaptation of King's Lear, a story from William Shakespeare , very tragic and full of treasons.Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, already old, decides to pass his powers and leadership for his older son,Taro,leading the other two as rulers of the other two castles. Saburo is the only son who says that is not happy with that decision,speaking against his father. This one,being fooled by flattery of the two older sons,decides to banish Saburo of his lands.After this, what comes is a series of perfidiousness of his older sons,and even his daughter in law, lady Kaede,who wants to revenge her family,since they were the true owners of the castle, and were killed by Hidetora.Hidetora becomes mad, and totally exiled from his lands. And he discovers that his son Saburo, was the only one who really was loyal to him.There are many messages in this movie;one of the them,clearly is that not all the compliments are honest, and they can have bad intentions behind. Sometimes,someone near you can look insolent,but is only being honest. It's better a horrible true, than a fake lie,although not all the people are prepared to listen to the true. Not to mention that sometimes, you think that the person who is going to help you,really doesn't care about you,(like Hidetora's older sons) and you find all the help you need, in people you expect to not even be concerned with you. (like Saburo,the exiled son, and even Tsurumaru, who has lost everything he had, including his eyes because of Hidetora, and even on this way, he helps the old man with shelter.)Kurosawa also shows a vision about the mankind: We only search for war and sadness, instead of happiness and peace. We, humans, alone,are destroying ourselves.",Ran

Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, while Jiro and Saburo will be given the Second and Third Castles. Hidetora will retain the title of Great Lord and Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro.Hidetora lectures them on the importance of unity by showing them that one arrow is fragile, but three arrows held together are much harder to break. However, Saburo breaks the three arrows across his knee and calls the lecture stupid, pointing out that Hidetora foolishly expects his sons to be loyal to him, while he himself has used the most ruthless methods to attain power. Hidetora mistakes these comments for a threat, and when his servant Tango comes to Saburo's defense, he banishes both men. Fujimaki, a warlord who had witnessed these events, and been impressed by Saburo's frankness, invites him to his dominion and offers him his daughter's hand in marriage.",Ran
56,frankde-jong,The last great film of Kurosawa,9,10 May 2020,"""Ran"" was made by Kurosawa when he was already 75 years old. It is his last great film.
Kurosawa had a long career, but it was interspersed with difficult periods of ""writers block"". Therefore finding funding for his films was noy always easy, especially in the second half of his career. ""Dersu Uzala"" (1975) was financed with Russian money and ""Ran"" (1985) with French money.From the three great Japanese directors after the Second World War (Ozu, Mizoguchi and Kurosawa) Kurosawa was the most Western one. The cultural influence went in both directions. Kurosawa had an influence on Western filmmaking. ""The magnificent seven"" (1960, John Sturges) was a remake of ""Seven Samurai"" (1954, Akira Kurosawa). On the other hand Kurosawa was inspired by Western literature, most notably by Shakespeare. Stange as it may sound Kurosawa is one of the most prominent Shakespeare adapters under the film directors. He brought MacBeth (""Throne of blood"", 1957), Hamlet (""The bad sleep well"", 1960) and King Lear (""Ran"", 1985) to the screen.King Lear is a pessimistic story in which a father is cheated by his elder sons. Only his youngest son remains faithful to him. In ""Ran"" the difference is visualised in the landscape. When the father is with his youngest son, the landscape is green. When the father is with the other sons, the landscape is black and consists of a volcanic type of sand. This black landscape is ideal for the fighting scenes because it provides a perfect background for the colorful banners of the different armies.The last scene is mindbogling but also not easy to forget. A blind man is all on his own, staying on the edge of a cliff. In essence he can't make another step.",Ran
57,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good,8,26 August 2010,"The DVD, put out by Wellspring, as The Masterworks Edition, actually offers some different features than the later two disk The Criterion Collection of the DVD. Both DVDs offer enhanced versions of the film. The Wellspring DVD still has some dirt and splotchiness, although the colors are well restored. And unlike Criterion, Wellspring uses gold subtitles, which are easier to read than the white subtitles Criterion uses. The DVD I saw has production notes, the film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, a restoration demonstration, and two film trailers. The chief difference lies in the commentaries. The Criterion version has only one commentary by film historian Stephen Prince, and has a documentary on Kurosawa called AK, by French filmmaker Chris Marker, as well as Toho Studios It Is Wonderful To Create series of documentaries on Kurosawa. By contrast, Wellspring has no featurettes, but a second film commentary, by film producer Peter Grilli. Grilli's commentary is flat and uninvolving, filled with sweeping generalities about film, in general, and this one specifically,; as well delivering few specifics on Ran, much less individual scenes and moments- either within the diegetic reality, or in the making of the film. It is also punctuated by several minutes long periods of silences. It begs the question of why was this person hired to do the commentary? The second commentary is also by Stephen Prince, and it is reportedly similar, but not exactly the same, as the later commentary he did for Criterion. Prince is a very hit and miss commentarian. This offering is one of his better ones. While he always trends to over-prepare and come across as bland and reading notes, this commentary is quite scene specific, and Prince seems to have loosened up a bit.Overall, the screenplay by Kurosawa, Masato Ide, and Hideo Oguni is a good one, although, as mentioned before, a better fleshing out of the characters was needed. The cinematography by Asakazu Nakai, Takao Saitō, Masaharu Ueda shows that good scenery alone does not make for great cinematography. One need only look at films like Sean Penn's Into The Wild or Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries to see that beautiful mountainscapes do not equal great art. Kurosawa's men, by contrast, show how framing and flattening out imagery with telephoto lenses can render reality into a sort of Japanese flat art depiction of the world. This also illustrates the superfluity and flat out wrongheadedness of most critical writing on the use of certain types of cameras or lenses to get certain effects, in this film and in general. Why? Because the flattening of images (such as in the openings ceremonial scenes in the mountains, or in certain interior ceremonial shots, especially when the frame is crowded) is not important for how it is achieved, but for what it imparts to the viewer. In these cases, the flattening of images into an almost Classical Oriental illustration makes the objects and characters in the frame seem to be closer to each other (sometimes almost on top of each other) than they really are in the internal reality of the film's narrative, which, in turn, makes the scenes seem and feel almost claustrophobic. This, then, makes the viewer feel what the characters do emotionally, as they are uneased by the internal circumstances and crowding, just as the viewer is by the external composition on screen. Thus, viewers understand the aggression on screen viscerally, cued by what amounts to a subliminal visual testosterone (think of the effect crowding has on male interactions at sporting events, or in cases of road rage). That these effects are achieved via a certain lens or camera technique are, again, far less important than what they impart into the viewer. That so few critics understand this about art, in general, and cinema, in particular, is typical of just why so much art and criticism is so bad, repetitive, and dependent upon the seeking out of artistic intent, rather than artistic effect. Why? Because intent is rather a simplistic declaration, whereas effect is a multifarious cogitation. There are also several jumpcuts in the film that depict emotional fragility of characters and moments. These all work well, and are employed so well that one often does not notice them, except subliminally, or upon rewatch. The score by Tôru Takemitsu has an otherworldly feel that really meshes beautifully with the images. It also is obviously influenced- at least emotionally- by Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score for The Planet Of The Apes.Oftentimes, when an artist has been as consistently great as Kurosawa was, his bar is set so high in expectation of ineffably great things that when one gets merely demonstrably terrific stuff from him, well, it seems wanting, although from lesser lights it would be praised sky high. Ran is a film that falls just shy of Kurosawa's greatest works, but stands leagues above the vast majority of the films we all watch. If that praise seems faint, then catch it when it falls onto you.",Ran
58,bobsgrock,"""Such is the human condition.""",8,2 January 2009,"For Akira Kurosawa, without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time, Ran marks the last great movie he ever made despite its shortcomings. It is hard to find fault with such a great director; one who has explored the very realistic nature of human living with classics such as Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo, and Red Beard. Here, he continues his love for Shakespeare by adapting King Lear to the samurai age as he shows an elder lord abdicate the throne to his eldest son only to watch it be tossed around amidst bloody and violent interactions.As with his other period pieces, Kurosawa pays attention to the little details and they all pay off and enhance the watching experience. Every scene is visually delicious from the remarkable sets and locations to the epic and colorful costumes and props. Kurosawa was also a master at filming action scenes and Ran is no exception. They battle scenes are rather graphic for Kurosawa but stunning nonetheless. Although this one didn't entice me as much as his earlier work, perhaps due to its slow-moving pacing and some rather complex motifs, this is still a very strong piece of work from the greatest of all Eastern directors and further shows that Akira Kurosawa is a director to be recognized and honored for all time.",Ran

61,TheUnknown837-1,"alongside the utterly brilliant ""Seven Samurai"", ""Ran"" defines Akira Kurosawa as one of the true masters of the art of film-making",10,10 February 2010,"To anybody who is in love with the art of film-making, Akira Kurosawa is a favorite name. Throughout his unfortunately not-so-successful (financially) career, he made a string of remarkable pictures that changed cinema overseas rather than in his own country. But what many people miss, I think, is how varied he was in his talents and tastes, and the way he dipped the tone of his pictures from one end of his career to the other. Look at his early pictures such as ""Yojimbo"", which more or less glorified violence and then look at his later ones such as the marvelously artistic ""Kagemusha"" and ""Ran,"" in which there is no atmospheric similarity.""Ran"" is loosely based on the Shakespeare classic ""King Lear,"" which I have had the pleasure to read. Combining elements of the play with some Japanese legends and myths, Kurosawa weaved a terrific story that not only exposed violence as harrowing and gut-wrenching, but made us ask a question: ""Why do human beings kill each other?"" The answer was not definitive, but it was clear: for petty reasons. In the picture, an aging tyrant (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom amongst his three ambitious sons and the two corrupt ones turn against him. Banished by his own flesh and blood, the tyrant is forced to live like an animal in the wilderness while his one noble son attempts to save him, and along the way, looses his wits and comes to terms with the horrible things that he did to gain his kingdom.There's a substantial different between King Lear and Lord Hidetora. Lear, as far as we know, was innocent and not worthy of having his daughters turn against him. Hidetora, by contrast, deserves it. Instead of retiring peacefully, he sees the monster that he was in youth. And what's brilliant is that Kurosawa decides not to flash back and show us the horrible things he did, the kingdoms he burned, but to tell us through other characters and see Hidetora react to them. The key character in this is Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), wife of one of Hidetora's sons, who is so cold-blooded and vicious that she makes Lady Macbeth seem as pleasant as the girl nextdoor. Harada is utterly brilliant as this vengeful psychopath, who is worked into one of the screen's most detestable villains. Every time she appears on screen, the audience (and the scene) grows silent, waiting in fear of what she's about to do. She's like a cobra, gliding along with his silk gown dragging behind her, hissing, posed to strike at any time. Her key to her viciousness is not witty dialogue (though she has that) but her silence.And the violence theme. Kurosawa painted a field red with blood in the climax of ""Kagemusha,"" but as he put it, ""Kagemusha"" was a dress rehearsable in comparison to ""Ran."" It's not just that Kurosawa paints the sets with blood, but that he makes it look horrible and frightening and dehumanizing. He exposes it as it is. And he reminds us that this is all for a petty reason. Hidetora murdered and pilaged to expand his territory so he could own more. Now he watches his sons murder before him, so they can spite him. There's a famous scene where Kurosawa shows a bloody massacre and shuts off all sound except for a music. It's like watching a silent movie and it has twice the impact it would have had had Kurosawa decided to mix in gunshots and screams and killings. Some of the killings look more like accidents on the set: so well-done that they look as though they couldn't have been simulated. The montage is gruesome and deliberately exacerbated with one chilling killing after another and not one bit of it is glorified or even cannily familiar to what Kurosawa had shown in ""Yojimbo,"" which though a fantastic picture, was child's play compared to ""Ran.""""Ran"" is not only a strong picture in its morality and story and theme, but it's also a professionally-made one with Kurosawa at his peak form. The movie looks beautiful with gorgeous cinematography. Kurosawa shot most of the movie in wide-angle, with very few close-ups, even in emotional ones. In my opinion, he did this to show as much of the landscape as possible, perhaps to remind us that all of this was happening because of the land these people are spilling blood over.There is so much I want to say about ""Ran,"" unfortunately I have a 1000-word limit on IMDb, so I have to cut it short. But I think my point is made. ""Ran"" is one of the milestones of cinema, and perhaps Kurosawa's most impacting picture and one of his very best. Even in his seventies, going blind, and without much financial backing, he made a heck of a movie.",Ran
62,sharky_55,乱 (Chaos),10,15 October 2015,"Kurosawa had fallen out of favour by this time in his career. Ran had been meticulously storyboarded by the director himself, painting colours and conceptualising the masterpiece in his mind years and years before he finally got the funding for what was the most expensive Japanese film at the time. The third and last of his Shakespeares, Ran tells the story of the old King Lear figure Hidetora. But there is a key difference; Shakespeare never delved into the details of the old king's past conquests and rulings, but here Hidetora is painted as a warlike persona, brutal and ruthless in his day. Fast forward years, and the ageing warlord cannot even commit seppuku with the katana he so once viciously brandished. The opening shots are almost garish in their use of colour. We do not expect the three heralded sons to be kitted out in the bright primaries of red, yellow and blue. We get wide shots of the clear blue sky, of endless grassy hills from all directions of the four riders as they look each way. Kurosawa's penchant for waiting for the perfect weather conditions pays off, because after banishment the clouds suddenly come out, and the grass is dull in the billowing wind. When Jiro's crimson army arrives to face Saburo, a cloud envelops the plain, and again when his envoy rides across the plain, bringing with him a false message of truce and an ominous shadow alongside. In 1985, hundreds of extras wait for that ten second shot. And in that harrowing and massive scale clash at the castle, the foreshadowed storm finally enters the film and serenades the massacre. It is a magnificent battle scene, with many things happening. Kurosawa chose to construct the entire third castle against a muddy hill and places his soldiers against the grimy backdrop, intensifying the colours emblazoned onto their uniform which signal their allegiance. His multi-cam coverage is never more evident here; placing cameras inside the battle itself and cutting judiciously to reveal horror after horror; a corpse being trampled by galloping horse, a solider struggling amongst the lifeless bodies of his comrades, another clutching his dismembered limb, and that magnificent shot of a crazy Hidetora, stumbling into the midst of the battlefield, while red and yellow sides watch him intently and the remains of a great castle burn from above. The cameras seldom dolly in Ran; they tilt and pan to reveal the action from a objective, omniscient view. There are sparse use of close-ups. As Ebert says, we are like gods, witnessing these atrocities of unfathomable nature. The Western orchestration punctuates Takemitsu's Eastern score; Kurosawa's divergence from tradition makes it all the more horrifying. Hidetora's ornate costume changes into rags, and his face becomes ghostly in his anguish and madness, deep gashes and burned eyes, the Noh influence stylising his mask-like Shiwajo as the weary old man wandering and contemplating his sins. Harada's Lady Kaede is another character of Noh influence. Observe how precise and elegantly she shuffles into the room, uses pointed questions to direct Kurogane to murder for her, before shutting him out. She drifts down onto the ground cross-legged, silent but so evidently displaying her sexual hold over Jiro. She explodes in emotion; the insane cackles as she seduces Jiro, closing each shoji one by one, and in that final moment where she confesses her vengeance and true motive. How long has she held Hidetora's atrocities in her mind? Kurosawa visualises her end in a sudden release of anger and bloodlust; no gore, but a painterly splash of blood on the back wall. A stark and powerful image. Shakespeare's play is perhaps not as focused as Ran is, with its multiple story lines and scattered soliloquies. Kurosawa's screen adaptation conjures images of sheer scale and horror like no theatre stage could. In that final scene, a blind Tsurumaru wanders and drops the image of Buddha into irrecoverable ruins. The gods have abandoned all sympathy. The camera paints a picture he will never see; a tiny helpless figure dead centre in a desolate, hellish world near sunset. Weren't we hunting boar in the idyllic bright hills just moments ago? How finite power is, and how even swifter seized power is lost.",Ran
63,tenshi_ippikiookami,Of family and power,8,17 February 2018,"One of Kurosawa's best, ""Ran"" is a story set on samurai era Japan that touches on different subjects, as for example family, power, revenge or betrayal, delivering a powerful movie that will stay for a long time with the viewer.Old Lord Hidetora Ichimonji is getting old and, when a couple of lords come to ask for his third son to marry one of the lord's daughters, Hidetora decides it is time to retire. He will divide his territories between his three sons and retire, even though he will keep his title and some power. The youngest, Saburo is against this decision, but the older two brothers are really happy with their father's decision and promise to take care of him. Saburo is sent away, stripped from all of his possessions and Hidetora starts his new life.What follows is a story of hate, betrayal, desire, corruption... You know, the stuff of great stories. The two older brothers start to plot against each other and against their father, the wife of the older brother too, Saburo just seems to worry about his father... There are a lot of threads but Kurosawa does an amazing job in threading them and keep the plot advancing while making things more and more interesting. The plot is full of nice twists and touches, and the characters are well rounded, their behavior and decisions well justified and presented. Kurosawa was a great director, and every frame of this movie is a clear example of his touch. Everything is really great, from the music to the palette of color, and even the use of the scenery is also top notch.Totally worth seeing, ""Ran"" is a movie about the dangers of power. Any kind of.",Ran
64,gftbiloxi,A Masterwork By A Master Artist,10,10 June 2007,"Born in 1910 Japan, Akira Kurosawa first studied painting before moving into film in the late 1930s. A well-known director in Japan throughout the 1940s, his 1950 production of RASHOMON launched him to international acclaim--and throughout the remainder of his long career he was widely acknowledged as among the world's greatest film directors, the creator of such films as THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and YOJIMBO. Released in 1985, RAN would be among his final films and is generally felt to be among his finest.Kurosawa often borrowed plot lines from Western literature, and with RAN--the Japanese word translates loosely as chaos--he lifted the basic story from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR. In Kurosawa's retelling, the Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom between three sons: Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu). When youngest son Saburo upbraids his father for foolishness, Hidetora banishes him--only to find Taro and Jiro turning against him just as Saburo predicted. Kurosawa shapes the Shakespearean story to 16th Century Japan, so it would be easy to belabor comparison with the original; at the same time, however, it is worth pointing out that he actually captures the story more effectively than any western filmmaker has to date.As in many Kurosawa films, RAN alternates moments of great stillness with rapacious action, enclosed spaces with wide vistas. In stillness, the film focuses upon its actors and their intrigues--perhaps most notably the perfidious Lady Kaede, a truly dark character frighteningly realized by actress Mieko Harada. Indeed, all the cast is remarkably fine. But the great centerpiece, and the great performance, of the film is Tatsuya Nakadai's Lord Hidetora, whose mixture of good intention and folly leads first to humiliation and then to madness. Perhaps the single most stunning moment of the film occurs when Hidetora, betrayed by his sons, walks down the tower steps of the third castle following a vicious battle. It is difficult to imagine many actors who could perform such a scene; it is equally difficult to imagine many directors who could stage it.Few directors are able to convey the sense of chaos, destruction, and fear with which Kurosawa endows battle scenes, and RAN is no exception. There are several, and the battle of the third castle (in which Hidetora is bested by sons Taro and Jiro) is easily among the finest battle sequences of Kurosawa's career. Presented without any sound except a simple, eloquent music score, flash-cutting between different groups in the struggle, the result is a unique mixture of beauty and horror--and in my opinion unequaled by any other film I've seen.It should be noted that RAN, unlike RASHOMON, THRONE OF BLOOD, YOJIMBO and many other Kurosawa films, is in color. I have long been used to the remarkable shading of Kurosawa's black and white films, and I missed it--but only for a moment. Kurosawa proves no less adept in color than in black and white, and RAN's use of color is remarkable. For this reason I particularly recommend the Criterion Collection edition of the film over any other; it is very fine. But regardless of the particular version, this is a film which must be seen by any one who appreciates Asian or world cinema, truly a masterwork by a great master.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Ran
65,KnightsofNi11,Just so beautiful,8,9 October 2010,"Ran succeeds as one of Akira Kurosawa's legendary epics. This film is an artistic masterpiece of such beauty and grandeur, that it can put one in an immense state of awe and wonder. I'm not always one for epic scale films like this, but in the context of a master of storytelling like Kurosawa, I loved it. Ran is an almost three hour tale of political unrest in a kingdom of feudal Japan. When the patriarch of the Ichimonji family, Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, decides he wants to live out his remaining years in peace and ease, he hands over power of the kingdom to his three sons. In the vibrant opening sequence of the movie, Lord Hidetora announces this to his sons are receives mixed reactions from them. Two of the sons flatter their father and accept his request happily. The youngest of the three sons has an entirely different reaction, telling his father of the mistake he is making and how the kingdom will crumble if the powers are to be divided like this. Furious at his sons accusations, Hidetora banishes his youngest son, leaving the two older sons to rule the kingdom. However, shortly after this exchanging of power, the youngest son's grave warnings become reality, and the two older sons conspire against their father to strip everything of him, including his title as The Great Lord. From here, war ensues in an elaborate tale of greed and deceit, as political turmoil leads to some of the grandest scenes ever imagined in this gigantic scale epic.Kurosawa's career began all the way back in the 1940's, so obviously the bulk of his film career consists of black and white films. Ran, however, was shot in color, and it is some of the brightest most eccentric color I have ever seen. The film opens in the beautiful rolling hills of Japan. The grass gleams a rich green, and the sky a vibrant blue. It's the kind of beautiful landscape that would bring a tear to the more transcendentalist eye. In this opening scene we are introduced to the main characters of this film. Lord Hidetora is dressed in a pure white kimono and his three sons each wear different colored kimonos that are all equally vivid. Jiro, the violent and unpredictable one, wears a blood red kimono. Taro, the slightly less unpredictable but more naive one, wears a glowing yellow kimono. And Saburo, the fair, peaceful, yet also truthful one, wears a soft blue kimono. These colors remain consistent throughout the film as Ran prides itself in color symbolism, using it as it's most important motif throughout the entire film. The opening scene sets the stage for the pacing and style of this film. What the characters say in this scene is obvious foreshadowing for what events will take place in the movie, what the characters simply wear is an almost bigger foreshadowing of how they will each play out and develop over the grand scale of this film.Ran continues to reinforce its use of color to heighten the visual experience of this film. By the end, it's hard to decipher whether you have just watched a painting within a film, or a film within a painting. Either way, this film is a work of art not only in cinematic context, but in the context of the painters medium as well. Kurosawa is known for his ability to set up a beautifully choreographed shot for every frame of this films, but with the added use of color in Ran it gives the film credence in multiple artistic mediums. Every shot could be reconstructed into a beautiful and vibrant painting Kurosawa did something genius here, and it might display a directors greatest transition from black and white to color in the history of cinema. It's somewhat sad to see how this added level of symbolism has seemed to dwindle away now that color has become the norm. The use of color in filmmaking has switched gears, when we now have directors shooting their films in black and white for artistic effect and color for something more normal.The greatness of Ran doesn't end at its visuals though. There is a fantastic narrative within these vivid and colorful vistas. It is a very slow paced film that dwells on certain scenes for a very long time, yet never overbearingly long. The story itself is fairly complex, as would be expected from such a grand scheme of a picture, yet as long as you stay with it, it is an incredible story with a great deal of subtext and underlying themes that serve to give it an even greater purpose as a revolutionary film. With any epic film like this you'd expect it to cover a lot of proverbial and existential ground and it certainly does. We see everything from the themes of close family bonds and loyalties, to the traumatic effects of war on the human mind and soul. Ran is a dramatic tragedy of lost innocence and peace. It is a harrowing look at the destruction of family and kingdom. Yet, despite these bleak themes, it still manages to be a stunningly beautiful film. This beauty serves to drive home the emotional impact of the film, engraving some very gripping images into your mind.Ran is a story told on such an unimaginably epic scale. It's complex narrative is not for everyone, yet if you put your mind towards understanding the emotion and symbolism of this film, it becomes something so much more than your average tale, even by Akira Kurosawa's standards. The film is rich both in story and visual artistry, and the two elements blend together so splendidly. This film is immaculate and is filled with such subtle emotional nuance. It is a sweepingly beautiful painting that tells its story in an unforgettable way. Ran is a timeless classic that stands out as one of Akira Kurosawa's best.",Ran
66,Holt344,"Akira Kurosawa delivers some of the most phenomenal and artistic imagery in film, a true masterpiece",10,5 April 2020,"In Medieval Japan, an elderly warlord retires, handing over his empire to his three sons. That's the opening of this masterpiece, a story so rich and each frame are simply stunning and artistic. It's my first movie from the acclaimed and legendary film maker/director Akira Kurosawa and maybe it wasn't a movie I should have started with but I've long wanted to see and experience it and I'm glad I did. The imagery is again pretty, extraordinary even. How Akira Kurosawa used paintings as storyboard is incredible and a very nice way of doing things. He also wrote the story and script ten years before filming so combine that with the paintings as storyboard we know that Ran was a passion project. The movie is based on William Shakespeare's King Lear but set in the Sengoku Period in Japan and it worked perfectly.The acting is phenomenal and feels very real and accurate to the time period, they succeed in giving a believable and dramatic performance that comes out as a perfect performance. The costume and prop department did a magnificent job at creating remarkable costumes and props that immerses you into this epic adventure that is Ran. The music is something amazing in the movie as it moves the story forward and used at emotional times. The various of sets they built was enormous, superb. With the huge amount of long shots Akira used made it look like paintings, the camera angles and such, it probably were exactly like he thought it would be.This was a very interesting experience, a movie so special but so superb. It's something I've never seen before and I'm glad I got the experience to watch this piece of art that might be Akira Kurosawa's Magnum Opus? Ran was phenomenal, strange at times but overall superb!",Ran
67,FilmOtaku,Not as great as I thought it would be,5,3 June 2005,"Realizing that it is practically heresy in the film world to criticize a Kurosawa film, much less downright dislike it, I'd like to precede my review by saying that I have absolutely loved every Kurosawa film I've seen  until now. ""Ran"", Kurosawa's 1985 film based somewhat on Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" is the story of an elderly emperor who hands down his kingdom to the oldest of his three sons. While the oldest and middle son fan over each other, saying that they are not deserving, etc. it is the youngest who speaks his mind about the subject, incurring the wrath of his father and ultimately, banishment from the area. Meanwhile, the two older sons are making a mess of things with the kingdom, leading to wars, fratricide and the dismissal of their father, even attempting his murder. None of their motives are noble or honorable, only avarice and power motivate them, leading to tragedy for all.Going into this, I knew that this was not going to be a light story by any means. For anyone who has read or is familiar with Lear, it is a story that is pretty much slogged through, though it is wonderfully told. ""Ran"" can pretty much be described the same way. While I certainly appreciated the good acting, the unbelievable costumes and the set design as a whole, I found myself unable to become engaged in the story. The pacing was extremely slow, certainly not an easy thing to deal with during a film that lasts about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it is the pacing, visuals and story that can really make a foreign film a success for me, and I found that ""Ran"" only had one compelling element out of the three, which managed to save it from being an absolute dud, but not enough to make it as awesome as Kurosawa's other films are. (And in using the word awesome, I really mean the word ""awe"") Because of the costumes, at times arresting imagery, and the ultimate fate of Lady Kaede (which bumped up the film by an entire point for me because of its bluntness) I'm not completely panning the film. While I feel the film was a bit disappointing, I'm more disappointed in myself for not being able to like it as much as I would have wanted, since it has had such amazing reviews. But since you can't like them all, ""Ran"" gets a 5/10 from me.--Shelly",Ran
68,charlytully,Colorful Asian warfare without ninjas-on-wire trickery,9,19 July 2009,"Unlike director Ang Lee's 2000 film CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, or director Yimou Zhang's American wide releases earlier this century (HERO in 2002, HOUSE OF THE FLYING DAGGERS in 2004, and CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER in 2006), viewers of Akira Kurosawa's 1985 epic RAN not only are treated to period warfare much more colorful than equivalent movies in European settings, but also get a sense of realism (as in, these things actually could have happened on planet Earth) missing from the four more recent Asian martial dramas.Since it was not Kurosawa's original intention to remake KING LEAR, and since only a few of the touches (such as youngest son Saburo's shading of his ""sleeping"" father's form in the opening scene, or the presence of Kyoami, a European-style court jester) are distinct ""borrowings"" from Shakespeare's play, film fans with an antipathy toward the bard should not be put off by RAN being listed as an ""adaptation"" of LEAR.Finally, if I were to compare a character from RAN with one from Shakespeare's opus, I would tend toward noting the similarity between the amoral ambitions of Lady Macbeth in the tragedy named for her hen-pecked husband to RAN's Lady Kaede (a brilliant Mieko Harada), who earns the fate of Macbeth himself with her no-holds-barred unquenchable thirst for revenge.",Ran
69,jdkraus,A glamorous Shakespearean achievement!! Kurosawa is truly one of the best directors!,10,10 October 2004,"The film Ran is based upon the Shakespearean tragedy of King Lear with a Japanese feeling, and some samurai tales added to it. The film is about an aging war lord named Hidetora who leads a clan called the Ichimonji and has three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. he decides to split his rule into thirds with his eldest as the leader. Everyone who hears the news is outraged, and his youngest son Saburo speaks agaisnt his father, only to tell the truth nad is thus banished from the kingdom, as well as his advisable councilor Tango.His two other sons soon become corrupt with greed and power, which takes up about the first hour of the film, which is rather slow paced and filled with Shakespearean like dialogue. it sounds o.k. from here. Then, without a warning, a huge battle sequence explodes on the screen started by his two sons! The battle is depicted in a very horrific but beautful sense that shows to other war films that filmmakers don't need visual effects and blaring music to fulfill the battle.because of this betrayal, Hidetora is forced into insanity and escapes the battle alive, while is eldest Taro dies, and Jiro takes the throne of the clan. As fate comes, Tango and his court jester Kyomi, who is wonderfully portrayed by Peter; Tango leaves to find Saburo who seeking him out, who has hidden hismelf with one of the other clans.here the film jumps between the story of Hidetora and Kyomi, which swtich roles beautifully from king to fool, to fool to king, and the manipulating power of Lady Kaede who seduces Jiro leader the Ichimonji clan. the film goes on with a gradual, but necessary pace for a two hour forty minute film.it is a film of tragedy, betrayal, and the powers of greed and deception. The most magnificent thing about this film is the cinematography that shows the mood of the story very explicitly. the costumes and set-decorations are fabulous and well made, the acting is grand, the music is haunting, and the story tells us that we should not fall for our desires, but fall for the goodness in life. 5/5",Ran
70,tomimt,The mad king,9,10 April 2005,"Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is an old clan leader of Ichimonji clan. He decides to give up his control to his oldest son Taro (Akira Terao), which is like a knife in the back of his middle son Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu). Only his youngest son Sabaru (Daisuke Ryu)tries to beg his father to reconsider: he knows what will happen. But no, Hidetora driven by his guilt of his murderous deeds during his rise to power wants to throw the towel in and to give peace a change, which he believes his oldest son will grand, and so maddened from the harsh words of Sabaru, he casts away his youngest son. But soon, it is discovered, that Taro and Jaro both want total control of the area. So begin the battle between two brothers, driving old Hidetora insane. In the middle Taros wife Kaede (Mieko Harada) prays the lives of Ichimonji clans brothers like a black widow. People say, that Ran is Kurosawas adaptation of Shakespeares play King Lear. I wouldn't know that, being that I've never read it. So I'll just take their word on it.Whole plot is full of schemes and conspiracies: everyone is on everyones death list. Very deep drama mixed with bloody battle scenes. And I am not talking about Hollywood type action, but far more brutal type of action, in style of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Acting is overall very good, tough like it is always in my case, I have this small cultural shock between Japanese actors and European/American ones. But it usually quickly wears off. Good actors are good, no matter the language.Direction of the whole movie is very good and cinematography is just stunning and full of colours. All images are extremely vivid and lush. Beaty mixed with violence. A combination, which is tried by many directors, but usually in vain, but Kurosawa carries it off almost painlessly.There's also lots of scenes with lots of extras running all about. In fact it took two years to make all the costumes for this flick, so make your calculations about the amount of all the extras in the flick.All in all very stunning movie, in fact I even dare to say, RAN is one of the finest made by Kurosawa.",Ran
71,Marwan-Bob,In a mad world only the mad are sane.,9,9 February 2017,"An absolute masterwork, the human being's dark sides as the main protagonists. Vengeance, hatred, betrayal, greed and what they bring with themselves. It's the deepest film that I've seen so far on Kurosawa's filmography. Visually beautiful, pure poetry in every frame and every death. There is strong symbolism on the red color and the fire. The history of humanity has been covered by blood and fueled with greed since the very beginning, among these beautiful landscapes, the human race have been destroying themselves no matter the family bond or friendship. Not only Kurosawa's best, but also the best film adaptation of Shakespeare.",Ran
72,gigan-92,"""Are there no godsno Buddha? If you exist hear me...Is it such fun to see men weep?""",10,30 March 2011,"A truly thought provoking bit of dialogue from one of Akira Kuorsawa's best works, a true masterpiece in the world of film. The film is so visually stunning one may completely forsake the meanings behind those images or worse walk away from the film confused. In response to that, another character remarks, ""It is the gods who weep. They see us killing each otherover and over since time began. They can't save us from ourselves."" To me this may quite possibly be Kurosawa's greatest achievement among many.Firstly, and rightly so, is the sheer greatness of the acting in this movie. I could go on about the greatness of each actor's performance, seeing as every performance stands out so well; no character is over shadowed or unforgettable. Instead I'll focus on the gorgeous story treatment and this film's themes. As I'm sure anybody who's reading this review knows, the story is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear."" Kurosawa uses Japanese history very well so, portraying quite faultlessly a warlord ruled Japan. This film, due to it being his most big budget production, has quite an epic feel to it as well. A vast landscape shot accompanied by the awesome cinematography creates a beautiful and majestic aura to the atmosphere as a whole. And the costume design is done artistically, very worthy of the award it won.Despite all that beauty, anyone who truly understands the film will realize it is easily Kurosawa's most nihilistic-toned film. The score itself is dark, brooding, stomach churning and never uplifts onto a joyous melody. The whole underlying theme in itself is the near pointlessness of our existence in this world. How man is naturally power hungry and lusts almost always for only their desires, no matter what they may be. Regardless of whom must one must hurt or toss aside to attain it, we will do it, for better or for most cases, worst. We naturally do this, and are more than willing to shed blood and commit betrayal to have what we want. There's a classic sense of Shakespeare tragic irony at work here, about how loyalty can be misplaced, and before we can even have a chance to make up for it the world can take away our redemption. After all his losses, including his power and sanity, all Hidetora wanted was forgiveness, and yet the opportunity was forever lost in death. His other two sons are easily seduced by the promise of power and intimacy but both also end up a victim of their own vile ways. And yet, it is not God's duty to punish the wicked, nor to praise the righteous. This seen many times in this movie, but is brought out to the fullest when the gruesome death of lady Keade comes to light. This character had lost her whole family at the hands of a war for power long ago, and lost everything but her own scarred brother. She coped, as she said to Hidetora in a great scene, by way of prayer to Buddha, a holy deity. Religion is her savior, but no amount of devotion saved her in the end. The same goes for her brother who sits atop the ruins of his childhood home, but has no idea his sister isn't returning. An image of Buddha she gave to him falls down below amongst the rocks, neither worsening nor benefiting his predicament. Man is alone to deal with his own self-constructed problems.""Don't cry. Its how the world is made. Men prefer sorrow over joy, suffering over peace.""",Ran
73,Rickting,Close to perfect,10,4 December 2014,"Akira Kurosawa is one of my favourite directors and William Shakespeare is my favourite writer of all time. As can be expected, combining the two creates cinematic gold. This adaptation of King Lear relocates the play to Japan a few centuries later than the play is set. A powerful war lord abdicates to his 3 sons and 2 of them turn against him and betray him. Shakespeare films rarely capture his genius, but this one does and then some. It adds depth and complexity to an already fine play, and makes the central character arguably even more compelling than he was in Shakespeare's version. It makes some changes here and there, but it doesn't feel overly different from its source material. This isn't just an adaptation of the play; it's using the play to create a sobering, fantastically powerful and completely mesmerising meditation of loyalty, chaos and war. This is absolutely incredible cinema which shows why it is one of the most successful art forms in the world. This dazzling, earth shaking masterpiece outshines not only every single other Shakespeare adaptation but all the paintings in the Lourve combined.Akira Kurosawa's direction is near perfect: The film looks unbelievable and the battle sequences are absolutely tremendous. Every single shot looks amazing and it's definitely his most beautiful film. The acting is absolutely astonishing, and there are some particularly frightening characters in this one. It also has an incredible script; it's incredibly deep, hauntingly powerful and none of the dialogue feels forced or awkward. It's a fairly slow movie, but you don't even notice it. The final shot of the movie is utterly haunting. Ran is a very powerful and thrilling movie with amazing action scenes, mind blowing acting and a brilliant story. It's so ridiculously captivating and well made 2 and a half hours disappear like nothing. Definitely one of the best foreign language movies ever and even better than the film which put Kurosawa on the map, Rashomon. Films like Romeo + Juliet and O are good, but they can't possibly hope to match this, which is actually just as good as King Lear itself. At least they actually say what happened to the fool this time.10/10",Ran

76,domino1003,Incredibly Visual Masterpiece,10,14 April 2007,"By the end of his life, Akira Kurasawa was losing his sight. However, like Beethoven when he was going deaf created beautiful music, Kurasawa created beautiful cinematic imagery.Such is the case with ""Ran,"" Kurasawa's version of King Lear with a samurai spin. The use of colors is absolutely magnificent.Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai)wants to spend his remaining days in peace and comfort and gives his three sons his kingdom, hoping to be welcomed as a guest. Even though his 2 older sons tell him everything he wants to hear, his youngest displeases him by telling him that he's making a mistake, that his 2 brothers would say anything to get what they want from him. Angry and hurt, he banishes his younger son and gives his kingdom to the 2 remaining sons.And this is where things go to hell.Lord Hidetora realizes that everything that his youngest son told him was true: His older sons not only treat him with an appalling lack of respect, but they conspire to take everything from him. This drives Hidetora to madness and sets off a chain of events in which Hidetora's past and present collide, leading to war between those involved.The scene in which Hidetora, slipping into madness as his kingdom is taken from him, flames surrounding him, is incredibly haunting.The battle scenes are so incredible, that you can't take your eyes from the screen, even to blink.For those who haven't seen any of Kurasawa's films, or haven't gotten into Shakespeare, then this is the film to start with. Even after over 20 years, the film has not lost any of its impact. Highly recommended.",Ran

78,net_orders,"All Dressed Up, But Going Nowhere.",3,25 July 2016,"Viewed on DVD. Costumes/makeup = ten (10) stars; restoration = ten (10) stars; score = nine (9) stars; set/decoration = nine (9) stars; sound = five (5) stars. Today's mega-budgeted, tent-pole films consist of spectacular, computer-generated technical set pieces strung together like beads on an extremely thin (or near nonexistent) plot string. Director Akira Kurosawa has employed a similar approach here. There are two major technical beads on his string (and a fair number of minor ones). One of the majors is presented in the opening scenes where costumes (and actors' makeup) are overwhelming spectacular and, perhaps, the most gorgeous ever filmed for a samurai-like movie. The other major technical set piece occurs in the closing scenes of intricate military maneuvers by huge (some real, some not) armies. The plot string is excessively stretched/padded-out as well as twisted up and knotted to the point of numbing confusion. (I am not a fan of voice overs, but this is one film that could really use one!) Acting is hammy and sometimes ludicrous (a Kurosawa trademark) with characters using dialog styles that are often challenging to comprehend even with the subtitles turned on (another Kurosawa trademark). Some sound dubbing is poorly executed with outdoor scenes sounding like they were recorded in an echo chamber. Sets (indoor and out) are/appear completely authentic (filming occurred around and inside the most spectacular extant castles in Japan (except for the royal family's). Stunt work is curious with each stunt fall from a horse looking pretty much identical (same stunt person each time or reuse of the same filmed sequence?). Viewers who are riders will find mounting a horse on the right especially interesting. Camera format could have greatly benefited from a much wider aspect ratio to engender a more epic feel. Film score is rich and integrates well with scenes. Restoration is outstanding. Bottom-line: This is an overly long in effect documentary on some of the technical aspects of making a movie masquerading as a movie. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",Ran

It's a great story with some of the darkest facets of human nature.Lord Hidetora's character probably struck me the most.  An old warrior, whose days of glorious battle are behind him, deals with his coming of age. Tatsuya Nakadai's acting is great and you can't help but feel for his plight.  The scene in the burning castle is so surreal and I loved Hidetora's face as you can feel his anguish.  So many themes are covered from loyalty (very important), honor, greed, the corruption of power, and insanity.  I don't want to go into detail too much without giving the plot away, but let's say that my first impressions of the characters proved to be severely wrong as the story progressed.  I noticed the tone of the film starts happy and peaceful, then just goes 180 towards chaos and anarchy. It's great.The cinematography is breathtaking.  Kurosawa captures the beauty of japanese landscapes from castle strongholds, fog covered land, to fields billowing in the wind.  The battle scenes are spectacular and the savagery of war is very realistic.  Colors are stunning from the soldiers' uniforms to rich red pools of blood in battle.

83,OttoVonB,Kurosawa Twilight,8,8 January 2003,"Ran is the most melancholy epic ever made. Knowing the context in which it was made only adds to that sense, but is hardly indispensable. It is the last classic Japanese samurai epic of the 20th century, and the last great film by a filmmaker who overshadowed most of his contemporaries.Adapting Shakespeare's King Lear to Medieval Japan and changing daughters to sons, Ran opens with an aging warlord (Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai) dividing his power among his sons, only to watch them sulk away. Intending to spend his twilight years visiting each in turn, he instead witnesses the slow disintegration of everything he has created and a vicious fraternal war.The 70s were a very rough time for Kurosawa, with the debacle of his first color and independent picture, attempted suicide and very slow rehabilitation. In this time he made only the Russian Dersu Ouzala, a fine film, but one that stands apart from his other work. He also devised the story of Ran, an impossible-to-finance behemoth of a picture at a time when Japanese filmmaking was evolving towards smaller, nimbler, and safer ventures. As the prospect of ever making Ran grew ever fainter, he set his sights on a smaller film to serve as a dress-rehearsal of sorts: Kagemusha. It took foreign financing, courtesy of his first generation of successful fans - George Lucas and Francis Coppola - to get that made, to great international acclaim. It also helped Kurosawa rebuild his confidence and throw himself at Ran with countless paintings and years of preparation behind him.If you've never seen anything by Kurosawa, or, worse yet, if you've only seen his earlier masterpieces Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, Ran might cause a bit of a shock at first. Those other films were the work of a master in his prime, confident, playful and extremely dynamic. Ran is a much more static, fatalistic an poised film, the product not just of a decade of storyboarding, but of a grim sense of doom born from Kurosawa's experience and the play he chose as his inspiration. That said, never has the cruel indifference of fate been so artfully depicted on a screen.The battle scenes are few, but haunting in their grim relentlessness. With his endless flows of colorful, authentically-armored soldiers, Kurosawa paints war scenes that manage to be both incredibly convincing and otherworldly at the same time. It conveys a sense of being a ghost, forced to witness the last hours of a dying world, something no other film has managed before or since. You will marvel at the mastery on display, but your enjoyment will depend on whether you can overcome the near-crushing pessimism on display. I struggled with that at the very end, and consequently cannot rate this as highly as his other films I mentioned. Nevertheless, Ran deserves deserves every bit of praise thrown at it.Watch it and decide for yourself.",Ran
84,tankace,The Japanishe version of King Lear.,10,4 January 2017,"Akira Kurosawa is among the most respected directors and writers of posrt-WW2 Japan with many of his films been consider as classics and Ran, which in Japanese means chaos is one of them and one of his last work. What I like is the fact that Mr. Kurosawa took inspiration of one of Shakespeare plays, King Lear to be precise and fused it with a historical figure of that era the daimyō Mōri Motonari, but the main plot is more or less the same with King's Lear.So during the Warring State Period of Japan we meet Hidetora Ichimonji a elderly warlord who seen that he is at the end of his life he gather his three sons and divides the area among them but he with retain the title of Lord. For that his youngest son ,Saburo fiercely disagrees with that plan and tells it immediately to his father that his plan is flawed. But Hidetora has none of it and banish him and gives the first castle to his eldest son Taro and the rest two to his second, Jiro. And as it is obvious by the inspiration of king Lear the two brothers treat their father poorly to a point he is reduce to a beggar!And at the same time Jiro seems to overthrow his brother, while Saburo with his allies later master a big army in order to pressure the rest two Ichimonji to take Father under his protection. In the end all of the House of Ichimonji is dead, their main castle is soon to be destroyed and the once prosperous realm is in ruins.Now to the characters for some of them are quit intrigue. I will start with the Ichimonji and then analyses some of their peripheral allies and antagonists. For starter Hiderota while he at first is in peace, he can't see that the brutal method which he used in order to take power have left a lot of grudges against his house and that his sons aren't as united as things. As for his first-born he is an oaf under the control of his wife Lady Kaede, whose castle was the now First castle and in the process her whole family was murdered in the night of her wedding (I guess the George R.R. Martin may took some inspirations) and she has one goal: to stay in her castle and keep it all cost, so she forces Taro to banish his Father and later after Taro is secretly assassinated by a trusted man of is brother Jiro during the siege of their Father's men in the abandoned Third castle, so to look like normal, she seduces Jiro.As for Jiro he is the Petyr Baelish family and he makes plans to take down his brother for him to be the next ruler of the clan, from this actions he seems to be angry that though smarter and better leader from his older brother he never got the recognition he deserved ,but when he becomes the ruler after his brother death he is practically a pawn against Kaede,who is leagues more manipulating than him and in the end she is one of the reasons the Ichimonji fell. As for Saburo he is blunt but not mean ,headstrong but not an idiot, in general he should be the next ruler, but it wasn't meet to be. For closing it will writer about my favorite secondary character,the right hand man of Jiro,Kurogane, although he has the dirty job for his lord ,he is totally realistic and when war is up on them, he is the only person who wants to find a solution with a peaceful way and also the only who see that his lord is ""under the spells"" of the recent widow of his brother.As for the fighting, is fast, devastating and 100% historically accurate. What I loved is the impact of the early firearm arquebus has for it kills two of the brothers ,Taro in a way to hide a treason and Saburo to deprive him of his victory. Also during the decisive battle of the dominion of the Ichimonji's state the firearm ,turn the table on the bigger Jiro's army who uses just mass attack of infantry and chavarly , but Saburo's troops, dag in the woods and every time the larger army comes to them is slaughtered. This is also true for the period, the introduction of firearms during the second half of the Waring period changed the way Wars were won and lost. Kurosaga intentionally shows firearm like that to make parallels with the atom bomb, the War changed and everyone who didn't not follow then new rules can't survive.All in all is an epic of a film, which though a bit slow it worth your time and gives plenty food for though and analyses of the psychology, war and the hobbesian world of that treason and violence create.",Ran

86,zeekwunlau,Ran,8,5 May 2020,"I think one of the more prominent aspects of this movie is the treatment of death and some major changes. Before death and some turning points, there was no preparatory work, but this thing happened naturally in a seemingly flat tile. . For example, the protagonist's sudden death, before this, there was not even any sign. Sometimes life and change are like this. Shaking people's hearts in peace is the power of real substitution. Although some deaths and accidents were sudden, they were calm. However, this does not mean that the film lacks a close-knit, but that his close-knit is more reflected in the changes in the relationship between the characters in some events. Death is also very dramatic, but his dramatic treatment of death is unconventional. Death should be a relatively important node in our previous drama concept, and it is also a more vigorous and tragic thing in our life concept, but when we return to life, death often occurs, not as we have agreed in the past. Roaring accompanied by tragic and accompanied by all predictable foreshadowing, death and even other things as usual, just a certain event, he may have a huge impact different from other things, but before and during and After it happened, it might not be like the fanfare we imagined. This conflict between the abnormal planning and treatment of the dramatic state and the previous mass perceptions has caused very large psychological and logical effects. Everyone saw the passing of a life in a tile, and suddenly, despite the calm, it contained a stronger force than the hustle and bustle, the sudden death of Xiuhu, the sudden death of the three sons, all these issues were handled in this way, It makes people feel impermanence in the absence of God. However, in order to avoid the tiredness caused by this sudden tiling process, Kurosawa adopted exaggerated colors and stage effects to deal with colors, and the form and content were highly rebelliously merged, becoming a classic of film and television.",Ran

After all it is Shakespeare and one must be patient with it if they are not a fan of the old school theatre.Colourfull clashing armies, The lord awaiting his fate in a burning castle, a brilliant execution scene (I consider the BEST I have ever seen film ever), and the blind being left in the hands of Buddha?While Seven Samurai will always be his perfection, Ran is more than an enjoyable movie that should be seen.

88,GeorgeRoots,Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece.,10,14 February 2015,"Kurosawa's last epic and the most expensive Japanese film of its time, ""Ran"" is the result of a master of his craft firing on a cylinders. Whilst my favourite of his work still remains ""Ikiru"" (1952), there is no doubt ""Ran"" is his masterpiece. The colours and level of detail the director went for is jaw dropping, spending 10 years storyboarding the film as paintings, even mourning the death of his wife for one day before returning to shooting the next. Kurosawa's ambitions and mad dedication pours out of every frame, and the results is one of those unforgettable ""landmark"" movies that can easily be considered among the greatest ever made.As we all know the man particularly excels at Shakespeare such as ""Throne of Blood"" (A ""Macbeth"" adaptation from 1957), ""Ran"" is based on the legends of the daimyo Mōri Motonari, as well as the tragedy ""King Lear"". Set in the Sengoku-era, Tatsuya Nakadai stars as Hidetora Ichimonji, an ageing warlord who decides to retire and separate the land between his three sons. Unfortunately the news does not bode well among the siblings, leading to events and betrayal that will leave the whole kingdom in jeopardy.I've said it before in my review of ""Kagemusha"" (1980), the colours of a Kurosawa movie are unmatched in their ""saturated"", watercolour like quality. And a particular silent battle scene speaks volumes when you see light pouring out the darkest of clouds, and the crimson red blood stain every wall. The theme of Nihilism is ever present, and obviously Kurosawa was more known for favouring Humanism among his work (There are a few brief glimpses in this tragedy that do show signs of redemption). But I think the ambitions of each individual is perfectly represented, with all their greed leading to their eventual demise.Tatsuya Nakadi stars in his last collaboration with this director, and his performance as the warlord descending into insanity is believable every step of the way. Though I'm not all to familiar with it, the film has been noted for its reminiscence of Japanese ""Noh"" theatre, and an extensive use of wardrobe for its 1000+ extras (The movie won an Academy award for its costumes). The dialogue driven story is fantastic, and the camera-work has that look about it that remains effortless.Final Verdict: I've praised this film enough, and I cannot think of any faults or shortcomings whatsoever. I hope you see it and become overwhelmed at its beauty, or at least its scope and efforts broaden your horizons. 10/10.",Ran
89,flingebunt,A legend???,7,16 March 2005,"If you know even the smallest bit of information about film making you will have heard of Akira Kurosawa. To call him a film director is somewhat mistaken as his movie making reflects his writing and cinematography as well.His influences on the film making world are great as well as happily being able to be inspired by many different sources. When Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola admire you enough to have a quick whip around with the hat to raise enough money so you can make a film, the term legend is not strong enough.He has made 16th century Japan his most popular subject both because this period represents the height of purely Japanese culture (becoming unique from Chinese culture and only just beginning to encounter western culture) and because it was a time of great conflict.Ran is based on a range of different sources. Those who think this is a Japanese version of Shakespeares ""King Lear"" are sadly mistaken. Yes, throne of blood was a remake of ""Macbeth"" but this movie uses a number of different inspirations. Yes, there is King Lear in there and that story is the main guide for Ran, but with many different developments. The primary inspiration for the story is from a real Samuri who split his empire between his 3 sons. Only in reality the 3 sons ruled happily and this story the opposite happens. He also manages to integrate elements of traditional Japanese No theater into the mix. He did this with throne of blood, but here it is seamless.The story starts with with the old war lord leading a hunting party. Afterwards he seems to fall asleep. My view is that he is not really asleep but dead and what we see later is his Ghost. He has a dream and when he ""wakes up"" he decides to split his kingdom between his sons.Then things go wrong. The sons fight each other and him. He is a man condemned to a hell where he sees the empire he has built ruined by the hate and betrayal of his life.A great epic tragedy. Perhaps many people will watch this movie after reading reviews wondering why people seem to think this movie is so great. Kurosawa is one of the most innovative film makers of all time. If you are interested in film making then his movies are a must. But those who complain that he never had enough main stream exposure, get over it. Americans took his innovations, slicked them up for a mass audience.Watch it, enjoy it, feel moved, analyze it, probably fail to get all the ideas, then watch it again. It is probably a little bit long and spends too much time on the ex-warlord going mad scenes and the ending is a bit of a fizzer.....(hmmm.......I can here the angry cry of a thousand angry film school students)....but it is still the work of one of the greatest geniuses in film making.And don't forget to watch the DVD comments, but seriously I don't think they really understand Kurosawa's real genius (for example, he tends to film the people listening rather than those talking, why, the talking is merely giving information, it is the reaction of the listener that is the most important).",Ran
90,jose-cruz53,Currently my Kurosawa favorite,10,17 October 2012,"I have seem, at this point of time:1 - Rashomon 2 - Seven Samurai 3 - Yiojimbo 4 - Kagemusha 5 - RanThe earlier Kurosawa films were very interesting, however, they lacked a certain ""budget thingie"". With material limitations I think Kurosawa was unable to fully realize his vision while here we have all cylinders firing as this was the most expensive film in Japanese history up to that point (converted to current dollars, it cost 30 million, a huge amount for the standards of the day!).This film has it all: massive battles, treachery, love, complex and interesting characters and can be understood fundamentally as a film about old age and its effects on the reduction of decision making capabilities of individual decision makers (that's sounded terrible, didn't it? :) ).So concluding this is the best film out of those five, that I have seem from Kurosawa. Highly recommended. I gave it only 9/10 to differentiate from the truly ""best"" films ever.",Ran
91,ExpendableMan,A beautiful epic,8,12 July 2007,"Given that Akira Kurosawa's sight had deteriorated so much by the time he made this movie, it's astonishing what a beautiful film Ran turned out to be. Filmed nigh on entirely in long shots, every single frame looks like a celebrated painter's masterpiece come to life, each one bursting with colour. From such examples as the hill top debate which begins the film, where 16th Century Japanese royalty sit in brightly coloured robes before the sweeping green mountains or the sight of colour-coordinated Samurai armies ransacking a fortress in a silent, apocalyptic battle, right up to the achingly sad final shot before the credits, every second of Ran is a beauty to behold. That isn't to say it's a film that'll concern only those interested in poetic visual statements however, because it is also one of the director's best works and a landmark moment in Eastern cinema.Basically an updating of Shakespeare's King Lear, the film sees the elderly Lord Hidetora Ichimonji deciding to hand over the reins of power to his three sons. His eldest, Taro, becomes the new Lord, while his younger sons Jiro and Saburo are each granted a province of their own to rule over. Saburo however protests, believing it to be a foolish decision that will split the clan and Hidetora banishes his third son. It isn't long however until Taro and Jiro's ambitions of power lead them to betray their father and the nation begins to fall apart, spurred on by Taro's manipulating wife lady Kaede.Kurosawa thus blends Shakespearean tragedy with a sweeping historical epic about the loss and gain of power. At the centre of it all is a remarkable acting presence in the shape of Tatsuya Nakadai as the displaced elderly Samurai. At the beginning of the film he is a man of stubborn pride, but as his world crumbles and his people die, he soon finds himself with nowhere else to go. The emotional turbulence of being betrayed by his own flesh and blood drives him to his limits, but nevertheless he still refuses to contact Saburo because his warrior principles will not allow him. As a man in his twilight years, lost in the world, there is definitely some element of Kurosawa himself up there on screen, the director having been near the end of his career with his health failing and his wife having tragically passed away during shooting. Hidetora isn't a perfect ruler but as evidence of his cruelty and oppression during his reign mount up, he remains a sympathetic character, questioning his past decisions and what exactly it is he has achieved in his lifetime. He is the pillar that holds the film together and no mistake.He is aided by some impressive performances all round. Daisuke Ryo's impetuous, outspoken but loyal Saburo is a highpoint of course even if his screen time is limited, spending the majority of the storyline in exile. Jinpachi Nezu's Jiro is another remarkable presence, equally proud and stubborn as his father but beset by insecurities and mistrust. The two that really standout however are Hisashi Igawa and Masayuki Yui as Jiro's General Kurogane and Saburo's Lieutenant Tango respectively. Kurogane is loyal soldier but he is a bit more complex than average because he knows that his master is a flawed and weak man, yet remains by his side to the bitter end. Tango on the other hand is an adviser who gets banished alongside Saburo, but who returns in the hour of need and goes through hell and high water to return his lord to safety.Sad to say though that not every character feels truly grounded in reality as Mieko Harada's Lady Kaede is the film's weak link (and the reason I'm not giving it a nine). Her performance is spot on as Kaede is a cold, calculating woman with vengeance on her mind at the best of times, but there are one or two moments in the script where the writing isn't particularly strong. During one pivotal scene towards the middle, she comes dangerously close to parody, verging from one dramatic emotional outburst to another, ranting, screaming and licking blood from a knife wound.Mercifully though, that is the only bad thing about this movie and fans of historical epics would do well to check it out. The battle scene that forms the centrepiece is absolutely breathtaking, with legions of Samurai warriors storming a castle in total silence. There are no sound effects, no speech, just the sad musical overture for the majority of the fighting, until a particularly important gun shot rings out and we are plunged right into the maelstrom. Bodies are filled with arrows, blood drips everywhere and hundreds of warriors are slaughtered in spectacular fashion. It may be a glorious sight to behold, but it is the closest thing a historical epic has got to showing that war is hell, no matter what period of human history it is set in.The more blood thirsty among us may then be disappointed by the second clash towards the end, a far more unremarkable skirmish that promised to be incredible after several scenes of armies manoeuvring in anticipation but even so, Ran is unquestionably a masterpiece. It gets into the heads of men who hold tremendous power and puts all their complexities and failings under a microscope for the world to see. Like a watercolour painting that moves, it is beautiful to watch time and time again.",Ran
92,ebossert,"Another Display of Directorial Ineptitude from the ""Master""",4,21 February 2009,"Review in one sentence: This movie has zero energy. What follows is my fragmented, chronological lambasting of this ""masterpiece."" The characters are cardboard cutouts with very little in terms of actual development. The opening scene begins with an argument between Hidetora and his three sons. It's almost like it assumes retroactive character maturity that was never established to begin with. It would have been nice to see some color in terms of personality, with each of these three key players given some screen time before the big fallout. In the seemingly endless line of miscalculations made on the part of our favorite ""masterful"" filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa (""AK"") decides to provide *his* kind of ""color""  vague one-liners. The ""pranks"" of the third son are referenced, but we get no actual development of his character (he does have one good moment later on). As for the other two sons, we don't even get AK's fuzzy caricatures. This viewer was left wholly indifferent by all of these sons, and their opaque motivations didn't help matters.Even worse is the portrayal of the vitally important fifth character. In AK's infinite stupidity, he chooses to have the key puppetmaster (Lady Kaede) simply state that her father and brothers were murdered by Hidetora and that her mother committed suicide. There is ample opportunity for a flashback (or a lengthy opening historical segment) that actually fleshes out her character while allowing the viewer to experience her sorrows directly, but AK simply settles for dull monologue by a one-dimensional personality. At one point (early in the film), she's sitting down and simply states that she's happy to be living in her old residence again. It's an utterly robotic, emotionless, tedious series of statements that are boring as hell. Only AK could portray vengeance in a manner this dull.We get the first battle and see a bunch of generic guys killing each other with no reason to care who actually wins. Some women that we don't know kill themselves along the way. There are some decent visuals though. Not bad, but not exactly scintillating.After the battle we get some of the vintage overacting that shows up in most of AK's films. Hidetora goes crazy and frolics in the grasslands. When his two buddies show up to comfort him, he stares into space, opens his mouth as wide as a Pez dispenser, and has a hissy fit while his jester runs around singing. It's a total disaster of dramaticism. But that's not all. Hidetora's buddies carry him to some random shack, only to learn that the resident just so happens to be a dude that got his eyes gauged out by Hidetora years ago. Impractical coincidence alert! So what does this blind dude do to the man who handicapped him for life? Does he curse him? Does he lunge at him with a knife? No. He plays a sad flute song. Hidetora then promptly throws *himself* through a wall. Such a ""masterful"" filmmaker, AK is.We go back to Lady Kaede, who magically goes from stoic carelessness to knife-wielding lunatic in 5 seconds flat, then takes another turn to hysterical crocodile tears only a few minutes later. Hey AK, that flashback would have been REALLY helpful. And do you know what else would have been helpful? A little relationship development between Kaede and the two sons to help the viewer in understanding exactly why these powerful men are wrapped around her little finger. You did have 160 minutes to use here. Why not use them properly for a change? Over 90 minutes in and we finally get a well-written moment when a stone fox-head is returned to Lady Kaede. Then again, even a broken clock is right twice a day. Of course, AK immediately follows this brief success with another laughable attempt at manipulation. The blind dude and his sister (who has become a target for assassination) are escorted to safety. His sister spots an old castle and tells him about it. He asks where it is. Now, any thoughtful sister would give her blind brother some idea of where this castle is. Perhaps she could take his hand and point it in the right direction. Unfortunately, this is one of those ""masterful"" Akira Kurosawa movies, so she simply blurts out ""Over there!"" The blind dude turns to the right, turns to the left, and asks ""Where?"" Some sad music accompanies this hopelessly incompetent scene where AK so blatantly reminds the viewer that  yes  the blind dude is, in fact, BLIND! Good ole AK wanted the viewer to feel sorry for the blind dude, so he constructs this ridiculous scene to pile it on. I laughed. The direction here is so terribly amateurish that only fanboys could possibly deny AK's clumsy incompetence.Hidetora gets amnesia and babbles senselessly. Stuff like, ""Who am I?"" and ""I'm lost."" ""Such is the human condition"", replies the jester. Give me a break. In a truly hilarious moment, the jester tells Hidetora to simply jump off a cliff if he's so disturbed about everything. Hidetora promptly jumps off a cliff. I laughed. Later on, Hidetora suddenly remembers that he has three sons. I'm serious.We get the final battle, which is pathetic. First of all, the blue samurai army somehow gets their hands on some semi-automatic rifles. What on earth are semi-automatic rifles doing in this period piece? Next, the editing is atrocious. The sequence is so badly cut up that one wonders if a young Paul Greengrass was hired as the action director. Third, the battle strategies suck. The red army rides around in circles while the blue army shoots them down. Not good.AK finishes things off with his patented overdramaticism. Hidetora even goes so far as to say  out loud, no less  ""Things are getting dark."" Wow. Just wow.",Ran

94,coconutkungfu-30704,Another Good Kurosawa Film,7,19 February 2020,Well-made Shakespeare adaptation that has beautiful cinematography and is an overall impressive film from a production standpoint. Not one of my Kurosawa favorites but still a good film.,Ran
95,krational66,"Right and wrong, success and failure, turn around and empty.",8,3 May 2020,"Kurosawa likes to adapt Shakespeare's plays, and most of his films are also few main characters. Fierce conflicts, simple and fixed scenes, consistent with the uniform structure, have their own characteristics.
In this movie, the characters are still simple. Xiuhu and his three sons, Xiuhu passed the command to his eldest son. The three sons were bluntly ousted by him. His home country was in chaos and he was also displaced. Taro and Jiro killed each other. After picking up his father, Xiuhu recognized his mistakes, but unfortunately he was in an ambush, and Xiuhu also died in anger.
But in this simple story, Kurosawa was able to shoot ups and downs, and it was exciting. This is also a consistent feature of his movies. The plot is often not complicated, but the director can make people worry and curious about how to progress. Perhaps this is inseparable from the characters 'distinctive personalities, that is, the characters are all It's very brilliant, so the plot retreats to the second place at this time, the director's creation of the atmosphere, and the character's Huacai performance at the gate, attract more audiences.
Kurosawa said that this movie was filmed with the attitude of overlooking the beings in the sky, so there are almost no close-ups and few close-ups.
The protagonist of this film is undoubtedly Xiu Hu, who is a lifelike interpretation of Zhong Dai Da Ya. He is not only a sullen general, but also a loving old father. From arbitrariness to despair, the character changes during it are very convincing and crazy. After that, fluttering white hair, angry eyes, sad eyes, and the strong wind blowing the shirt from time to time, revealing his thighs that were too late to wear pants for escape, are all so sad-the impermanence of the world, From the top to the bottom, the disillusionment is undoubtedly unfolding.
The two women inside were also very striking. Both wives were destroyed by Xiuhu and their father and brother died, but they chose different paths. The wife of Taro, A Feng, retaliated, instigated Taro, then seduce Erlang, and finally the brothers murdered each other. She was also slaughtered, but she died without regret, rather willing to destroy the city, her determination and viciousness were shocking. In Kurosawa's ""Spider's Nest City"", there is also such a lady. Even if she is scheming or short-sighted, she finally sends her husband back, and it is also a vicious lady who is cruel and murderous. This lady had similarities with A Feng, the director at that time also meant to blame the character's failure on the shortsightedness and greed of the woman, but when she came to A Feng, she gave a more reasonable explanation, namely It's not that women are insidious by nature, but that there is a reason for it, and that there is excuse, A Feng is shaped into the role of the goddess of revenge.
The other Mrs. Mo, who was devoted to the Buddha, was very helpless about Xiuhu 's slaughter city in the past, and Xiuhu was very helpless about this. She said that if you are bad for me, I will be in a better mood, but Mrs. Mo is not at all with him Careful, recite the Buddha every day, and still remember to carry the portrait of Buddha on the way to escape. When was the grievance reported? With a gesture of evasion and forgiveness, Madam Mor gave another solution to the hatred.
In the end, the family of Xiuhu's family collapsed, only Mrs. Mo's brother Hemaru, the blind man was still alive. He was using the blind stick to explore the road on the ruins of his former home city, and almost fell into the abyss. Perhaps it is a kind of metaphor. All living beings are just like blind people. They cannot see the way forward. If they lose the heart of Buddha and compassion, the abyss is in front.
Probably only such a tragedy can be filmed in the mood of overlooking the whole life in the sky. Otherwise, how could you bear to reveal the truth to the public so naked, Lu Xun said that the people in the iron house are actually afraid of such a tragic, but someone must wake up the people in that room. The bitter fruit that Xiu Hu finally tasted was originally planted by him. Even if there is a son who is reliable, he finally cannot withstand the retribution of karma. Looking back on life, is it a success or a failure? Is it gain or lose? The crazy Xiuhu muttered to himself, who I am, when he finally realized that he was small, it was too late.

96,manendra-lodhi,"""A bloody family feud.""",10,25 May 2013,"Ran is 160 minutes of pure engagement, fun, action or whatever you wished for. It's a tale about an Ichimonji clan who has a ruler Hidetora and his three sons. Within the first few minutes itself the entire story will become clear to you. Kurosawa's mastery is seen in how the story progresses involving many characters and each playing a specific part. Lord Hidetora is ageing and he decides to give control of his kingdom to his eldest son. What follows next is a powerful display of human nature mingled with treachery, war skill, decision making, loyalty and many more. Keeping the main story on the top all the time it allows the viewer to think about the question of good or bad. Lord Hidetora's past was filled with slaughter and suffering to people and it comes back to him making the viewer wonder whether to sympathize with him or not. The film takes inspiration from the Shakespeare's king Lear. The acting from Tatsuya Nakadai (Hidetora) was spellbinding. Majority of his work was done by his scary eyes which depicted his inability to do anything when he understood that the fall of his empire was imminent. His face with all that whiteness of exasperation speaks things which no one after watching the film can ever forget. There is active participation of the supporting casts including the women (who influenced the story greatly) who might be the king's associate but were free to speak. It is the most expensive film Kurosawa had made and speaks for itself. The beautiful landscapes, the costumes, the palaces, the army scenes all shout for their achievements individually. It felt like everyone in the family had a grunt over something and wanted to be a part of it. The brothers had no affection at all for each of them. It would be nice to have a prequel to this story to see how these characters developed in the past. MESSAGE: ""Circle of life.""VERDICT: ""A must watch""",Ran
97,Christopher_Reid,Breathtakingly beautiful.,10,21 October 2007,"Ran was unlike any other film I had ever seen. It has Kurosawa's stamp of awesomeness of course but visually it just blew me away. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. The costumes, the castle and of course all of the locations are amazing. I was literally speechless for a few hours after having seen the movie; it completely changed (or at least refreshed) the way I look at the world. I think one of Kurosawa's strengths is that as incredibly talented as he is, his modesty always comes across as well; his films are never pretentious.Perhaps the only possible flaw I felt the movie had was that it only used music sparingly. I thought the music that was used was great (especially one surreal sequence which had solely music and images, no sound effects) but I wonder why more music wasn't used to add depth to some of the slower scenes. Maybe the lack of music is ultimately more effective, perhaps it enhances the dreamlike reflective quality of the movie, I can't say for sure.I don't have anything to say about the story really; I haven't read King Lear and narratives are a relatively weak point for me with movies. I tend to find the visual and musical aspects more accessible with dialogue and story more difficult to truly appreciate. I certainly found the story in Ran very engaging and thought provoking but what makes the movie for me is Kurosawa's masterful direction and also the way he makes the movie personal. Even though I didn't completely follow the movie at all times, several parts were very affecting nevertheless and it was clear that the movie meant a lot to its creator.Ran also has an epic grandeur to it; it was the most expensive Japanese film made up to its time and apparently Kurosawa spent about 10 years painting (!) ""storyboards"" for the movie. I think it shows in the movie, you really feel like so much work and consideration went into every second of it.Anyway, the way I see it, Ran is unlike any other film ever made. In terms of capturing beauty on a grand (and yet humble) scale, it is unparalleled (in my puny amount of experience). If I were a pretentious film snob (which I hope I'm not, at least, not yet) then I might say that ""if you haven't seen Ran, you haven't experienced cinema"". That would be a fairly accurate description of what it felt like for me.",Ran
98,Artimidor,"Shakespeare, Kurosawa - a classic spectacle",10,23 May 2012,"In Ran, one of Akira Kurosawa's last pictures, the legendary director once again returns to themes he has dealt with before in such impressive pictures as ""Throne of Blood"" or ""Yojimbo"", and these are: power struggle, arrogance, selfishness, greed, betrayal, suspicion, revenge, blackmail, battle upon battle, madness, death and tragedy. To sum it all up means to spell the title of this epic: ""Ran"", which stands for ""Chaos"", and this is exactly what you can expect when things get out of hand in a once thriving land. The film is a loose rendition of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and begins with what an old warlord thinks to be a good idea: to abdicate and make room for younger blood. But his three sons have their own agendas and soon clash to decide upon the right of succession until everything that reminds of the once glory days is irretrievably gone.""Ran"" lasts nearly three hours, has beautifully choreographed battle scenes, sharp dialog and is packed with lots of strong main characters: aspiring and falling warlords, conniving wives, a faithful, wise jester, a symbolic blind man on the edge of a cliff, to name just a few...

But the chaos found within this film is not the Michael Bay style of mayhem that we are used to, it's the chaos that is perfectly controlled and derives from each aspect of the production. Kurosawa brilliantly frames each shot as a painting, staging actors often in the foreground of amazing sets and backdrops.The battle scenes are epically staged as Kurosawa shows logistical prowess as the geography and thematic elements of the battle scenes are easy to follow. Nothing is left out and it is all laid out in a clear and concise way. Cinematically, the battles are the culmination of Kurosawa's directorial career. Bright red blood stains the ground it flows on and the skill of the samurai is well illustrated.Like all Shakespeare works, the story is set in a world of heightened reality. The acting is turned up to 110% and the plot is pure melodrama. There could have been 15-20 minutes shaved off as the film loses a lot of momentum near the middle point, but that would also take away from the amazing performances from Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada.""Ran"" is a masterwork from a master director.

I come back to this film every few years, and each time it impresses me more. LOTR may have bested it for grand battles, but such are only a means, not an end, in RAN.Superficially, RAN is a King Lear story about a Japanese warlord who abdicates his throne and is betrayed by his elder sons after sending his true youngest son into exile. His dream to visit each son in turn and stay over a few days at the ""in-law addition"" to the family castles is thwarted when his sons want to usurp every last bit of his power and the whole clan goes down in war.In reality, RAN is about female power. And manipulation. Power manipulation. Sexual manipulation. Manipulation for revenge. The Supreme Manipulator is Lady Kaede. The battles are just her chess games. The sons are just numbers - literally, their names mean ""First,"" ""Second,"" and ""Third""-born. The fate of Hidetora Ichimonji, our King Lear, is not sealed when he trusts his elder sons and sends his true youngest son into exile at the beginning of the film. It was sealed long before the film started, when he massacred Lady Kaede's family in front of her eyes, and then forced the unspeakable on her: marrying her to his eldest son as a spoil of war. Little did he understand how much more cunning than he she is. How much more patient. How much more manipulative. Seemingly peaceful years pass with Hidetora watching his kingdom prosper, but the tree has already been severed at the roots.When Lady Kaede is finally beheaded at the end of the film, it is too late. Lady Kaede's most dangerous body part is gone: the brain that plots, the mouth that whispers destruction into her husbands ears. Her plans have already come to full fruition, and the destruction of her family is avenged by the complete destruction of Hidetora's. Who is to say that she is more evil than Hidetora or his sons? Has she done more unto them than Hidetora did to her? Did she ever wield anything but her tongue, while powerless men kill and rampage with their swords?RAN is surely Kurosawa's greatest opus, and his last. The Twelve Samurai and the Hidden Fortress are fine films, but ultimately just sophisticated action films. RAN is a film of color, of symbolism that is powerful but never in-your-face, of emancipation, and of revenge served oh so very cold.",Ran
101,dkncd,Shakespeare in Japan,10,28 September 2007,"""Ran"" is Akira Kurosawa's film which takes the story of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" and adapts it to be set in feudal Japan.

Tôru Takemitsu's score also adds to the grandeur of this film.The performances of the film are also memorable. Tatsuya Nakadai is effective at showing the decline of Hidetora Ichimonji and making him a sympathetic figure despite his checkered past. The three Ichimonji sons are also well-portrayed and seeing the rivalries of these three strong characters is impressive. Also of note is Mieko Harada's performance as Lady Kaede, who is unnerving to the last. Shinnosuke Ikehata also plays the role of Shakespearean fool well and the supporting performances are commendable.The film is effective at developing its characters and story without seeming slow-paced. To punctuate the character and story development, the film has some battle scenes. These are well-staged and shot on an epic scale. In particular there is a siege and a major battle which are unforgettable. ""Ran"" momentously recreates the tragedy of ""King Lear"" with adept characterizations, exquisite color and grand scale conflict.",Ran
102,quinimdb,Ran,9,24 July 2016,"""Ran"" is a poignant epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear. Many call it one of the best (if not the best) Shakespeare film adaptations, and while I haven't seen enough Shakespeare films to say for sure, it's hard to see any other one topping this one.The film begins on huge rolling hills, where Lord Hidetora has gathered his acquaintances and his three sons. He blacks out, and suddenly he decides he will choose his successor right there. He picks his oldest son, Taro. Taro and the middle son, Jiro, suck up to their father by saying they will serve him loyally until his death. The youngest son, Sabaro, knows exactly what is going on. He calls them out on it. Then Lord Hidetora decides he will give power to all three of his sons, but Sabaro once again sees flaws in this. He knows the three brothers will not get along. He is banished, since Hidetora needs everyone to be loyal and follow him blindly, rather than taking criticism when he needs to.This causes a slow downward spiral. Taro is convinced by his wife, whose family was killed and village was burned by Hidetora, to force his father to give him complete power, but he is clearly not cut out for being a King. He already can't control his soldiers. Hidetora leaves the kingdom and while he is gone, Tango Hiragana, one of his advisers, comes to him with gifts given from peasants. Hidetora is told that the samurai never accepts charity, so he orders the peasants dead, but he finds out from Tango that those peasants were told by Taro to never send food to Hidetora, or else they will die. These people were pushing away Taro and asking for Hidetora back, but he just killed them. Tango suggests Hidetora should put Sabaro as king, but Hidetora didn't want the truth. He now has no where. Hidetora is told that Tango is just trying to stir up trouble between his family and take the throne for himself. He pretends that he did nothing wrong, but this causes his downfall. Both Taro and Jiro betray him and invade the castle at the same time, in an incredibly violent and intense scene. Not only have Hidetoras sons betrayed him, but all of his loyal followers have died in front of his face and it was his fault. Despite nearly dying many times, and arrows and gunfire flying all around him, Hidetora comes out alive, and what follows is his punishment, his personal hell. He confronts all of his past atrocities, such as a boy whose family he killed, and eyes torn out. The wreckage of a palace he burnt to the ground. But the two most truthful people in the film, aside from Sabaro, Lady Kaede, his loyal jester whom he saves earlier in the film (part of what shows Hidetora has the potential to be a good person, since she jokes about his foolishness frequently), and Tango. They look for Sabaro. Meanwhile, his son Jiro, who killed his other son that was taking the throne, is sitting atop the throne, but he is being controlled by his brothers widow, who is now his wife. She threatens him and then she controls him by earning his trust. Jiro isn't strong enough to be a leader of his own, so he succumbs to blind loyalty to his new ""wife"". Sabaro confronts Jiro, and this is where Jiros downfall begins. He is told by many that he shouldn't start a war with Sabaro, and he tells Sabaro he won't, yet he stabs him in the back the first chance he gets. He attacks, but Sabaro has a plan. There are men in the woods firing guns at the oncoming attackers, and despite Jiros orders, which they don't want to follow since he didn't truly earn their trust, the men retreat. Jiros wife reveals that she was just trying to get revenge for her family, and she did it. Then she is killed. Sabaro then reunites with Hidetora, and Hidetora at first can't forgive himself and doesn't think Sabaro will forgive him, but he comes to his senses and seems completely changed, and he essentially had redeemed himself. All he cares about anymore is Sabaro. Then Sabaro is killed by one of Jiros soldiers. Lady Kaede blames the gods who she worshiped, but the true blame is on man. As one soldier states, the gods try to make things right, but man has to always go and make things worse. We have an obsession with violence and our rulers will always continue to kill and kill, until the rational ones die and the cycle repeats itself. Then we get a poignant shot of Tsurumaru, the kid who had his eyes torn out, dropping a portrait of Buddha as he stands atop a mountain, showing how humans themselves deny justice from the gods and truly control things. And the good will always go out with a whimper, not a bang. They don't get to go out as valiant soldiers.",Ran
103,f-57307,great!,8,2 May 2020,"This is a masterpiece that is enough to be included in the history of Japanese movies. Akira Kurosawa used the classic script to make a shocking story.

104,pritol,Stunning alternate take on King Lear...,8,25 August 2021,"It's widely known that this film is based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and in its execution is stacks up just as well as the original. The story is in this case that of a warlord in Feudal Japan, stepping down from his position and dividing his kingdom between his 3 sons....what ensues is chaos.Whilst some of the original plot points are reversed, I.e - instead of 3 daughters, there are 3 sons, the story does retain some original Shakespearean components. The one that stands out to me is that of the warlords ""fool"". It's not something you would see in Japanese courts, but was very much part and parcel of medieval Europe. The Fool though does play a crucial role, in often speaking to and observing truths that key characters do not often notice.Story and plot structure aside, the colour palette is stunning, and the cinematography is beautiful. The scale of some of the sets are just spectacular, with gorgeous costumes and set design giving the whole movie an authentic dramatic feel. My favourite parts were the scenes involving horses / cavalry, the number of extras were in the thousands, not a CGI soldier in sight...I very nearly gave this film a 9, but in some moments it is so dramatic and theatrical, with long drawn out silences that is slows the flow of the film. I understand it's to build suspense and focus on poignant moments, but it doesn't always deliver....Not a film to watch everyday, but it is a work of art, and should be viewed as such.",Ran
105,FilmSnobby,"Kurosawa communes with Shakespeare, again . . .",7,24 July 2005,". . . with somewhat less scintillating results than the first time, *Throne of Blood* from the late Fifties. Of course, some of this has to do with the obvious fact that ""Macbeth"" is just more amenable to cinema than ""King Lear"": the former play is much briefer, more to the point, and has more visual possibilities. ""Lear"" also contains reams of philosophical commentary on Man's place in the cosmos which, I fear, gets lost in translation to any other language, let alone Japanese. I'll expand on that a little later.But first, praise is due. If the poetic meat of ""Lear"" necessarily must be excised from the milieu of 16th-century war-torn Japan, one can still admire Kurosawa for brilliantly adapting the play's plot and characters to their new setting. Obviously, the tired old king of ancient Britain morphs easily into a tired old samurai overlord (Tatsuya Nakadai as ""Hidetora""). But instead of the three daughters, we get three sons. As in Shakespeare, the elder two are bad, the younger good: the former use language to hide their true natures from the king; the latter's inability to use language to SHOW his true, good nature causes his precipitate banishment from Hidetora's dominions. The good son is accompanied in banishment by loyal samurai Tongo, the equivalent to Kent. The wife of the eldest son, Lady Kaeda (Meiko Harada in the greatest female role in all of Kurosawa), is nominally this movie's version of evil Edmund, but in actuality she is Edmund, Goneril, and Regan all rolled into one silk kimono. Indeed, the ""bad"" sons seem unable to commit the vilest crimes without Kaeda's prodding. One scene that demonstrates Kaeda's nastiness with absolutely brilliant economy shows her sobbing on the floor, trying to soften up second son Jiro into marrying her after the eldest son Taro -- her former husband -- has been treacherously killed in battle. With Jiro's back turned, she viciously squashes a moth on the floor without the least interruption in her performance.Minor roles are also transposed: the old samurai has in his service the Japanese equivalent of a court jester, who, as in Shakespeare's play, serves the somewhat tiring function of continually pointing out what a mistake the ruler has made by abdicating and then dividing the kingdom. The good characters Gloucester and Edgar are sort of mixed and matched interchangeably with a brother and sister tag-team of woe: the brother, blinded, is a hermit living in squalor, and the sister is a frightened mouse having fully retreated into Shindo Buddhism. Both of these characters are the damaged results of Hidetora's warlike past, their misfortunes entirely due to their father having been Hidetora's enemy.And this elemental difference in Hidetora's and Lear's back-story is what finally trips up *Ran*, in my judgment. Artists are always attempting to re-write Shakespeare; all fail, even the greatest artists like Akira Kurosawa. Lear was ""more sinned against than sinning""; Hidetora is basically getting his comeuppance for past brutalities. This is perhaps a suitable enough alteration for Eastern sensibilities: a movie that invokes the Great Buddha is bound to find dramatic justice in an old man suffering the retribution of all of his bad karma. But this idea just isn't as bold as Shakespeare's. Lear pays the price for his foibles twenty-fold, and his sad story is really but a small item in a world of chaotic violence in which maliciousness is the one certainty. Life just isn't fair, and karma has nothing to do with it, either way. Kurosawa, despite depicting all manner of barbarities in this film, clearly couldn't stomach Shakespeare's nihilistic vision of the world. In *Ran*, Tongo reprimands the jester for getting angry at the gods, going on to say, ""The gods weep for us""; in ""King Lear"", the gods are simply absent. I think Kurosawa lost his nerve. I also think that the Lady Kaeda could have done without the tiresome ""motivation"" for her actions. Unalloyed evil was good enough for Goneril and Regan, and, for that matter, Asaji, the Lady Macbeth-figure in Kurosawa's own *Throne of Blood*. Giving Kaeda a revenge motive deprives her of no small amount of force.Of course, the latter quibble can be considered more than adequately compensated for by such scenes as when she requests a henchman to salt the head of the Lady Sue after cutting it off, so that it would keep better in the heat for presentation. And, of course, any other deficiencies *Ran* might have can be relegated to nitpicking when one considers the great siege of the Third Castle in the middle of the film -- the crowning glory of Kurosawa's epic mode. Horrific carnage mounts over a mournful, Mahlerian score (which changes suddenly and explosively into ambient sound when Taro gets shot), finally culminating in one of cinema's greatest moments: a $1.5 million set going up in flames while Nakadai as Hidetora, denied seppuku and now finally mad, parts two armies like some awesome ghost, trudging his way toward oblivion. If Hidetora is sadly denied Lear's articulation, Kurosawa gives him some of the most brilliant visual presentation that a great artist can conjure. As such, comparisons between the actual director (seventy-five during the film's making) and his subject seem notoriously wrongheaded. Kurosawa hadn't abdicated any throne. Not yet.7 stars out of 10.",Ran
106,murtaza_mma,Greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic,10,3 July 2009,"Ran is probably cinema's greatest rendition of a Shakespearean Epic, ironically coming from an oriental film-maker. Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. The story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",Ran
107,luisguillermoc3,They are the gods who cry when they see the folly of men,9,29 April 2010,"Days pass, years pass and the centuries, human society still does not understand anything about existence. All we need is to learn to live in brotherhood with each other, but, in principle, from the rulers themselves given the damn example of the opposite: there is competition, rivals will be usurped, is invaded and destroyed. With this, governments are the worst enemy of social justice, and they share the ideological backwardness is so impoverishing humanity. If they disappeared the absurd desire for power, would be so easy to live in brotherhood! Would be enough for anybody accumulate, the land was for everyone and that food and housing, were guaranteed to every human being.But so far in sight that beautiful day of light and understanding that would bring happiness to each and every one of the men! Therefore, I join the cry kurosawan one of the characters in this brilliant version of ""King Lear"", has made the Japanese master, ""is the gods who weep. We are killing ourselves, over and over again from the beginning of time. They can not save us from ourselves. Men prefer sorrow to joy and suffering to peace... and celebrate death"". Someone very naive, he thought there in the seventeenth century, that the barbarism of ""King Lear"" was a thing of the past, and since then, adapted the play a happy ending that was sustained for several years... even when others concluded that even man, lacked sufficient clarity to learn to live in peace and that the steep roads of the work, were still drawn for many men today.""RAN"" means chaos and is the most obvious and painful example of the human blind has been maintained for centuries. The men are killed by the external power is envied by material possessions, self-destruct by law of compensation, and ignorant of all history, they repeat and repeat the same process annihilating to infinity. A very personal version and sobering, a lucid and illuminating adaptation of a work which, by its importance, remains over the centuries. William Shakespeare will always be irreplaceable in the literature, and ""Emperor"" Akira Kurosawa, will remain eternal in the dignity of film art. A film worthy of the highest praise.",Ran
108,BB-15,Classic Story of Betrayal,10,26 November 1999,"Ran (or Chaos) is a brilliant film. For some, there are a few obstacles to its enjoyment. It takes place at the time of the Samurai and it's subtitled since it is in Japanese. If that is ok, (it was fine with me) then you can look forward to a powerful tale of intrigue and betrayal. Speaking of the story, while it is based on Shakespeare (King Lear), it contains lots of action. And unlike some movies based on his work, Ran is very easy to follow. The first thing you notice about Ran is the style of the camera work. The scenery is often beautiful and Kurosawa uses powerful telephoto lenses to interestingly compress distance. The plot begins to unfold about an arrogant Lord and his three sons. It seems like a simple family squabble but the family members are often not what they seem. Everyone believes they know what is happening but almost no one understands the danger they are all in.
The castles, battle scenes and the costumes are tremendous. I especially liked the quiet moments. For in every silence, a terrible event was beginning to unfold. The performances by the brothers are good. The Lord played by Tatsuya Nakadai is outstanding. But it is Mieko Harada playing Lady Kaede who steals the show.Ran vividly shows how fragile family and sanity are. It is a paranoid vision where anyone can do harm. Yet, it is all glossed over by the polished customs of the traditional Japanese world which increases the story's intensity. There are good people in Ran. They cling to their faith. But they are at the mercy of the arrogant, who are blind to the need to work together, to make any society work. No other film illustrates the need for cooperation at every level better than Ran.",Ran

It just seems like an epic tale that has been with us forever, not a film from 1985. Everything, dear reader, everything about this movie works. Gorgeous sets, costumes and cinematography immerse you into this world unlike anything else.The Bad: it's too long? But for it to be any shorter would not do justice to its characters or epic plot. Honestly, nothing really.The Ugly: one detail I love is how the characters behave like people from that era of history.

111,Det_McNulty,Kurosawa's Final Masterpiece Is A Godsend,10,24 December 2007,"There it was. My second viewing of Ran, and the one which made me acknowledge just how much of an auteur Akira Kurosawa was. I have seen numerous films from the director and literally all of them are essential viewing, yet one of those particular essentials is undoubtedly the director's concluding, 1985 epic. Set on the foundations of William Shakespeare's King Lear and produced on a remarkably large by Japanese standards at the time- $12 million budget, Ran draws corresponding angles between ancient Japanese history and the classic literacy theme of tyranny.Kurosawa's inspiration for the picture is as follows; ""when I read that three arrows together are invincible, that's not true. I started doubting, and that's when I started thinking: the house was prosperous and the sons were courageous. What if this fascinating man had bad sons?"" Those words describe the general premise of Ran, not just the beginning idea, but the focal-point. Also, the King Lear insight was something which fascinated Kurosawa, as he had always wanted to create a past for the characters in his version of the tale (something he similarly did with Throne of Blood).Beginning with an extended scene set against the expansive and luscious background of Mount Aso -during the historic period of Feudal Japan- and ending in full-scale war. This contrast depicts how easily broken a ""peace"" can be, and the escalating tension slowly builds until the land's ageing Great Lord flees his own land to avoid his children's bitter quarrelling. Almost all the characters in the film are after some sort of power; the Lord recognises the yearning his own family have to take the land from him and expresses his disgust towards their selfishness, gluttony, deceptiveness and disrespectful nature. Yet the youngest son observes the evil taking place and attempts to rescue his father from the wrath of his deceitful brothers. Keep in mind; this is based on a Shakespearian tale, so tragedy is always inevitable.Ever since its release, Ran has garnered practically 100% unanimous praise and is often denounced as a modern masterpiece, along with the previous and far less polished work, Kagemusha (Kurosawa called it ""a dress rehearsal for Ran""). There is something about the to-be classic which for me personally- offers more satisfaction than any other picture by the Japanese auteur. Many would argue that the film is not as entertaining as Kurosawa's '50s and '60s outings, such as Yojimbo and Seven Samurai, but I would disagree, as much as I adore such classics. In retrospect, nearly every finished Kurosawa product was and continues to remain a great film, if not a masterpiece. Only a collected minority of directors have ever held such unmatched stability.The symbolic use of individually coloured clothing accentuates the emotions of each character; primary colours, yellow, red, blue and white are worn by the principal characters at the start of the piece. Heavy weight is pressed on conveying four predominant and reoccurring themes; turmoil, age, nihilism and warfare. The violence obviously existed throughout the Lord's reign, as an increased inner thirst (predominantly from his children) for control had been looming over the elderly Lord each day he grew older. Kurosawa is said to of intentionally made the chaos displayed a metaphor for an apocalypse of modern nuclear warfare. Well, it sure works.More than anything else, Kurosawa proved his ability to craft films which were in touch with contemporary cinema, but still included all the elements which develop a classic. Without hesitation I would cite Ran as the film which employs the finest use of long-shot cinematography. This is a mere sampling of my feelings towards the technicalities, let alone the film as a whole. Eruptions of unqualified chaos have never been so intoxicating.",Ran
112,Soysoy,There's more to this than meets the (immature) eye...,10,7 September 2003,"On the surface, this is an epic. Well it is actually an epic to a certain extent, which probably explains the surprising popularity of this movie, considering the average modern viewer's lack of interest for artistic ambition in movies.But below the surface... This is so clever it took me almost 20 years to really get it. The first time I saw ""Ran"", it was in 1986... I was 25. I saw an epic. Got impressed with the imagery, got bored with the narrative style. Since then, my tastes have vastly changed (dare I say ""improved""? ;-)), so have my inclinations towards cinema in general, and the way I approach artistic works. That's life. I would probably have loved LOTR when I was 20 *LOL*!I'm usually not at all into this kind of movies. Even if I admire to a certain extent Kurosawa's skills and good intentions, I generally still get bored with his movies, even after all this time spent in discovering artistic cinema, because to my sense they're basically Theatre, not Cinema, just (very) cleverly recorded for the big screen. Theatrical acting, theatrical scenery, theatrical dramatic construction. And as I don't like that much the conventions and mannerisms of Theatre (matter of cultural background), most of Kurosawa's movies (despite their quite obvious qualities, like outstanding artistic framing, use of space, pace, atmosphere...) fail to interest me but on a mere intellectual level. In short, I find them too artificial to my taste (like many ""intellectual"" french movies btw).But ""Ran"" is a winner. Because in this movie, this theatrical approach pays, like it does -but much less IMO- in ""Dersu Uzala"". And it pays sooo much! The acting/scenery theatrical conventions - some being inherited from NO - fit the story perfectly, allowing the attentive viewer to catch each and every single subtlety of the narrative, giving life to archetypes instead of stereotypes, and offers the rare possibility to consider things from dramatically different points of view. It's artificial and intellectually constructed, sure, but this very characteristic, against all odds, gives birth to an emotional ballet, a poetic power that is quite rare in the movie industry. And the humor! It's an incredibly daring (and very dark) humor, always on the verge of artistic suicide... Kubrick is capable of such humor sometimes (I suspect there is a lot of hidden cynical humor in ""Eyes"" - maybe I'll get it in another 10 years? *LOL*). Chen Kaige tried to use some similar humoristic twists in the very derivative (but nevertheless enjoyable) ""Jing ke ci qin wang"", but the result is far from being on par with Ran's wicked, cruel, over-cynical humor. Shakespeare would probably be very proud of this. My opinion, of course.The visuals are astounding, and help me to remember the difference between art/style and artifice/mannerism (the latter being the norm in most of modern blockbusters' cinematography, like in ""LOTR"" - over-idealized, over-clean, iconic, synthetic, demagogic, manipulative).  Kurosawa (I think) basically built on the ""Barry Lyndon"" approach and took it to a whole new level. Very, very impressive. The beauty and the power of these images.Sure, it requires attention, patience, receptivity, and sure it's not easy to get over some surprisingly bad moves (like awkward, almost laughable battle movements) but it's well worth it. Below the ""epic"" surface, this is a demanding, challenging movie to understand (many great movies are, like ""2001"" or ""Lost Highway"", which explains the fact that such masterpieces sadly don't get the deserved recognition in their times but only after a fair amount of time), but the rewarding is proportional to the efforts the viewer accepts to make. Oh of course, if you're on the ""movies-are-made-to-entertain-and-they're-crap-if-they-don't"" side, just forget it, and wait until you're grown up a little. Just like I did.In short, ""Ran"" is quite an outstanding audiovisual and emotional trip. It may take time for one's taste to adjust, depending on one's previous experience in reading books and viewing movies (it took me about 18 years to come back to this movie with an open mind..!), and it may take time to reveal its hidden treasures, but I repeat myself: It's weeeeeeell worth it.",Ran
113,zolaaar,Jester and Warlord,10,3 November 2005,"'Ran' is the Japanese word for chaos, riot, dissension. Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece is indeed a feast of destruction and perdition, charged with symbols and powerful in pictures like it is found very rarely in today's cinema.The dusky story is based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. In the film a Japanese warlord celebrates his own downfall. Kurosawa devised this with a radical film language which works with certain imageries of colors, rapid cut sequences and a sophisticated sound design. When the colorful flags of the different armies get intermixed in a battle, when the peacefully quiet wind (which carries the soundtrack) swells to a raving storm or when long wide shots suddenly segue into shots of details that follow hot on each other's heels then you realize Kurosawa's incredible style which deeply influenced the cinema worldwide.The drawings of the characters are equally terrific. Hidetora's jester is for a certain reason always at the side of the warlord. Their relationship alters as the film continues: Jester and warlord change their roles which makes it hard to distinguish both. Just as the sky turns from blue to grey with dark clouds, the violent past of Hidetora is catching up the aging lord. His trail of murder and predation is not forgotten, the brutally conquered land still carries the old scarves of war and exploitation which now burst out again.The viewer can take this monumental work as a warning to the destructive power of war, which is even decades later at present and beset those who seed the violence.",Ran

In fact, it seems to glorify violence.And to claim that it's a ""beautiful"" film is even more twisted. Violence and carnage are not ""beautiful"".

That he produced an epic of such proportions makes a further evaluation of the great man's contribution to cinema necessary.'Ran' (translating as Chaos) is set in medieval Japan and follows the basic King Lear narrative closely. Lord Hidetora is an aging warlord and, wanting a peaceful retirement, decides to divide his kingdom up amongst his three sons. After banishing the youngest, Saburo, for pouring scorn on the idea, Hidetora finds himself an unwanted obstacle to the older two. After repeated humiliations, pride forces Hidetora into vain wanderings on the open plain, his state of mind declining as rapidly as his entourage.The film sets itself the unenviable task of trying to explain the precarious position man holds within the universe. Man is seen to be elevating himself to such a level that he dreams of challenging the very laws of nature. Hidetora has achieved his status through deception, callousness and violence; his notion to wash away the blood he has spilt in happy retirement is scornfully thrown back by the elements. The speed and manner in which he is forced to lie in the bed he has made for himself should serve as a warning to all.The films large set pieces, particularly two quite stunning battle sequences, are staged magnificently, but 'Ran' is no empty epic. The characters and their motivations are fully explored and the tension built up by the dialogue fully compliments the action. With an ending which offers no redemption 'Ran' paints a bleak picture - the colours and brushstrokes it employs however, turn it into a dazzling masterpiece.One point - the second main battle reminds me of 'Zulu' with the soldiers lined up on the skyline shouting down.",Ran

I didn't expect it to be so theatrical, even down to the make-up which seemed more theatrical than usual for naturalistic cinema. I do wonder if maybe Kurosawa in his later period was sensitive to Japanese criticisms that he was too 'western' in his technique, and wanted to give it more of a Japanese feel - or perhaps he was deliberately paying tribute to the theatrical origin of the story, rather than the usual film technique of attempting to 'open out' and naturalize adopted plays.I found this theatricality sometimes a problem - shots are often from afar, and no attempt whatever is given to providing the characters with back stories. I found this provided a disconnect for me - i never really felt any empathy for the characters. So much of the dialogue was in the form of soliloquy rather than natural conversation. Judging from my further reading about the movie, the subtitles do not adequately translate the subtlety of the original Japanese script, which i understand was in a deliberately archaic and poetic style - impossible to translate properly. Perhaps this is one of those rare movies where a dubbed version would be better than subtitled - a skillful scriptwriter may have been able to come up with an appropriate and distinct language and tone for the characters.Those concerns aside, this is certainly a great movie, epic in scope and with a huge emotional impact. While some criticize the running time, i feel it is perfect, I was never bored. His pacing is perfect, bringing the pace up slowly but inexorably to the great battle scene (very well rendered, its rare that battles are filmed in such a manner that allows tactics to be so apparent to the viewer), up to the devastating final scenes. While the final metaphor may be a little heavy handed, it is immensely powerful.",Ran
118,latsblaster,Ran: A heavy and great Kurosawa-movie,10,19 June 2003,"This must be one of the most unknown classic Kurosawa-movies in Sweden. When Swedish Television showed some Kurosawa-movies, ""Ran"" was not one of them. Few Swedish people seems to have seen ""Ran"", so they don't know about it. However, ""Ran"" was more impressive than I could have expect. I have big respect for Kurosawa, and it is even bigger after seeing ""Ran"". 'Ran' is based on a Shakespeare- tragedy, and it is very dark and sad. The American title ""Chaos"" fits very well on the plot. Kurosawa worked hard with ""Ran"" with perfect result. It was engaging without being too much. But sometimes, it's really heavy and it is almost too much sorrow to experience. From start to end, true movie-quality atmosphere is in every scene.Rating: 10 of 10.",Ran
119,philip-ct,"Don't abdicate, pleeeeeez",1,21 October 2001,"Shakespeare's Lear is not my favourite play, largely because of its length and overkill (the subplot and main plot; the repetitions; the Sturm und Drang). It is equally difficult to stage vibrantly. But, put it in Japanese, add in an extra 30 minutes (for measure), and you have a spectacular film that manages to disengage its audience. More than that, it is strangely alienating and makes the original play more appealing and palatable. It's a great pity the storm and drama didn't wipe them out earlier - a far better, though less 'artistic' and certainly less pretentious (and less uneven) option would be to watch 1000 Acres and compare this to Olivier's King Lear....  Tedious.",Ran
120,KIDOLOHKEN,This is terrible.,1,6 October 2020,"After reading the script written by Kurosawa, the scriptwriter Hideo Oguni advised him as follows
He said, ""The audience is different today than when King Lear was written. In Shakespeare's time, the audience knew firsthand how important a powerful king was. They knew how tragic it was that he was dying and that his sons were fighting one another. In the audience minds, there was always the fear of invasion from another country. But that's not the case for today's moviegoers. The script has to explain that how the King was strong, how he was smart, how he was feared, how he was loved...
Shinobu Hashimoto, the screenwriter famous for ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Seppuku"", also expressed the same opinion in his autobiography.
But Kurosawa ignored their advice and made the film as he had written it. Even though the masterpiece he made in his prime was made thanks to their advice...
And then they made this terrible failure. In the original story, there is a character named Kent. That person tries to protect Lear. It shows how good King Lear was, how respected he was and how important a position he still holds today. In trying to protect King Lear, that means simultaneously trying to protect the nation. Whether it would work or not was very thrilling to the audience at the time.
Shakespeare used this kind of device in his works, but Kurosawa did not. In his script, Kent was reduced in size and the misery of the King was magnified. The reality of the drama as a large scale drama was lost and it became a mere drama about an old man becoming miserable.
If the king, who had been wielding the power, suddenly became an old geezer, the people around him would be more panicked. In the original story, the children were his daughters, so their rash behavior, ignorant of politics, was realistic. And there was prudence in the behavior of their husbands. In the 'Ran', the new kings are acting like morons as the daughters of King Lear. The new king and his entourage should have behaved more cautiously because they were afraid of the former king's influence. If the story was depicted in such a way, the potential of the third son when he teamed up with the former King would be implied and the audience would be able to enjoy the movie to the end even if the former King become more miserable for a while.
... The pictures are not beautiful at all and the acting is at the level of arts and crafts. This is a bad movie of a bad movie.",Ran
121,jonr-3,Astonishing and heartbreaking,10,20 December 2003,"Surely ""Ran"" must rank among the very greatest dramatic creations of history.  This work, loosely modeled on ""King Lear,"" presents the heartbreak and ""chaos"" of the human condition, and the merciless horror of war, incomparably.  It is sometimes hard to watch but I cannot imagine anybody viewing it and not coming away deeply moved.For me, much of the power of the battle scenes comes from the unspeakably mournful music of Toru Takemitsu, another very great master.  That we have preserved the collaboration of Kurosawa and Takemitsu, and that these two artistic geniuses handled such serious and thought-worthy material with such gravity and depth, is the incomparable good fortune of filmgoers everywhere. I feel deep gratitude to the makers of art such as ""Ran.""  May there always be a current flowing in art that is capable of nourishing such work. Humanity needs it.",Ran

123,Dark Eye,Grab a bowl of popcorn for this one,10,17 April 2002,"Ran is a great movie, because its a lot of fun in a spectacular way.  Much like the Seven Samurai and Yojimbo, its a great mix of serious filmmaking and entertainment, which means you can just sit down on a couch for more than 2 hours, absorbing all the little details while munching on popcorns. I tell you, this is rare since most movies are either too cerebral (not a bad thing) or too bombastic (sometimes not a bad thing). The battle sequences are very, very nicely done, and the characters are so tragic. Seeing someone like Hidetora falling downhill into a crazed, senile old man has never been so much fun. All sorts of characters appear in a form of double crossers, weaklings, manipulators, fools, honourable warriors, tragic victims, heroes... they're all here. Its easy to get convoluted in its plot, dialogue and visual scenes and say ""oh Ran is about betrayal"" or ""Ran speaks on the horror of war."" Look closely, and you'll see that Kurosawa uses the whole film to point out that mankind are foolish and questions our ability to change, even though we are aware of it (Ikiru shares this subtle parallelism on theme). The very last scene with Tsurumaru alone on a cliff is unforgettable.Buy it, hire it, or borrow it, it doesn't matter as long as you get to watch Ran, because it will be a blast.",Ran
124,hbdave_77,Must watch Masterpiece epic,8,9 November 2008,"The movie is a Japanese adaptation of Shakespeare's 'King Lear' from the legendary director Akira Kurosawa. King Hidetora Ichimonji is 70 years old now. Among all of his three sons-Taro, Jiro & Saburo, he chose his eldest son Taro as a successor of his throne & demanded his other two sons to support him. The youngest son Saburo is prankster but the wisest & he isn't happy with this decision & rejected the idea. So the king banished him from the kingdom. And rest lies royal conspiracy, treachery & human tragedy. The movie is maybe the first color film of Kurosawa & rich with detailing cinematography, epic in its scale. It is also technically sound & polished film by Kurosawa. Watch the violent enemy attack tragedy scene inside the castle- a hall of fame of Kurosawa touch. The movie reflects too didactic in its approach. But without doubt its one of darkest drama he had made reflecting his fascination with history of human insanity. I missed Toshiro Miffune in the film - an inseparable part of almost all his masterpiece films. Must watch if you like Kurosawa films.Ratings-8/10",Ran
125,barkingechoacrosswaves,Superb,9,17 February 2010,"I saw this movie when it first came out but remembered very little of it. How fortunate I was to be able to see a new print of this movie on a cinema screen recently!I have seen many of Kurosawa's movies and have to say that this is certainly among the best of them. For pure spectacle nothing else he did comes close, with remarkably choreographed battle scenes, but that is just the icing on the cake. The actors, headed by the truly splendid Nakadai, all acquit themselves well including, most especially, Mieko Harada who gives a volcanic performance as the archetypal femme fatale sowing ruin wherever she goes. The story is epic and timeless, and the cinematography and editing are wonderful. The whole enterprise is spiced with Kurosawa's laser-like focus on human folly.If you have the opportunity to see this movie, particularly in a cinema, do not miss it. Then watch Yojimbo and compare the two -- they are both great films from the same maker yet refreshingly distinct treatments of the smallness, cruelty, stupidity and majesty of humans.",Ran
126,shusei,Dramaturgy of RAN,10,23 August 2003,"First of all,I must say that this film will be the last and probably the best example of Japanese cinema, having tried to adapt Japanese traditional aesthetics, which is now dying. Kurosawa was very fond of theater NO, and in some films--""Throne of the blood"", ""Kagemusha"" and partly other jidaigeki films--he tried to use the elements of this traditional theater--slow movement of actors, sudden change of tempo,dialogue with Buddhist concept of life and death, mask-like make up of actors etc. But the most ambitious attempt of Kurosawa on this direction was in dramaturgy of ""Kagemusha"" and ""RAN"". They are twins in this sense. ""Kagemusha""'s story--the real person and his double, who is trying to be ""real"" and in the end dies as a result of the contact of two world--this world and the world of the dead--is very similar to one genre of theater NO--Fukushiki-Mugen-NO. ""RAN"" followed the same genre but the plot is based on one of Shakespeare's tragedy. The dramaturgy of theater NO and Shakespeare's plot were miraculously mixed and made into a quite original scenario, which in fact two-layered everywhere. So in this film there are so many terms from Buddhism and Shintoism, such a slow tempo and a sudden nightmare of the hero, which brings him to the unreal world of madness.Dream invades the real world and changes it into total chaos--""RAN"" means ""rebel"" and ""chaos"" at the same time. This deep structure may not be noticed by contemporary Japanese youth, probably will be forgotten by most of us, but it is really the artistic point which the director wanted to reach for about 40years,after he had seen theater NO at the first time---total simulation of this theater into his own cinema.",Ran
127,miloc,Film and poetry.,10,4 March 2002,"I'd like to say, firstly, that I don't generally trust ""visually stunning"" films.  There are a lot of movies that rely on grand special effects, bright lights, and tricksy cinematography to dazzle us past the fact that in the words of Gertrude Stein, ""There's no 'there' there.""  (Or as David Mamet put it: ""But what is it in aid of?"") Ridley Scott, for instance, you can have.  Granted, his movies look spiffing, but a fog machine doth not a catharsis make.Kurosawa's visuals, of course, are famous, and often imitated, and here and there in his films he has fallen somewhat into the same trap-- but only here and there.  Not so in ""Ran.""""Ran"" may be the closest thing to pure poetry I have seen on the screen-- you can almost hear the cadences of the recitation.  I don't trust spectacle, but in ""Ran"" the spectacle is informed with wrenching emotion, and a terrifying weight-- it's the only great tragedy of the screen, the only one that lets you feel the size of tragedy.  For once visuals are not just a magic show or window dressing-- in the absence of Shakespeare's language we have Kurosawa's images, and it is no small thing to say in the light of this that ""Ran"" is the greatest Shakespearean adaptation for the screen.  Why this should be I don't know, but perhaps it took an old man-- Kurosawa, his sight failing, entering the realm of darkness, with a heavy disillusionment with the world to give force to his age, to get at the heart of Shakespeare's play: a mammoth, brooding anger at the sins of the world.Shakespeare, luckily, got through this period to a craggy sense of redemption in his final plays.  It's a pity Kurosawa never got to ""The Tempest.""",Ran

He is now ready to pass on his castles and lands to his three sons, and wants his legacy to be one of peace. But the three sons quickly become enemies as they vie for power, and plunge the kingdom into chaos and war.The plot and characters are brilliantly adapted from King Lear - the plot is complex and characters' fates intertwine with one another beautifully.""Ran"" is beautifully shot - it is set in a mountainous region of Kyushu Island, and it makes you want to travel there. The sight of dozens of cavalrymen dressed in 16th century armor, thundering across ridges and fording rivers, sends chills up your spine.The ""jester"" is brilliant in the alternating roles of caregiving and ridiculer of the aging Hidetora, and has a knack for coming up with lines both amusing and deeply illuminating.The battle scenes are incredible. Over 1,400 extras were used, and a suit of armor had to be made for each. Some 200 horses were used. The stunts also are amazing... there had to be some bones broken when you see these guys falling off their horses at a full run. There's another scene where an infantry soldier tries to get out of the way of a cavalryman thundering toward him, and the horse's breast hits him full in the chest, sending him flying.There a really memorable scene where Kurosawa has built a $1.5M replica of a castle, and burns it to the ground. The sight of the castle, fully engulfed, and Hidetora walking down the steps in his descent toward madness, has to be one of the best all-time film scenes.My only criticism is the length - it lags a couple of times. Kurosawa really liked lingering on scenes so the viewer can fully absorb and think about them.",Ran
129,el_nickster,Kurosawa's crowning masterpiece.,10,15 April 2007,"This is Kurosawa's adaptation of ""King Lear,"" set in feudal Japan.

Jiro and Taro toady to their father, each harboring secret hopes to eradicate the other brothers (and old Hidetora himself). Suburo rails at his father's foolishness, warning him that by dividing power in the valley he invites generations of chaos and war. Enraged by Suburo's defiance, old Hidetora banishes him. True to Suburo's warnings, the country soon falls into strife as Taro and Jiro turn on each other, turn on Hidetora, and turn on Suburo.This is a magnificent film. Ten stars is not enough. The plot is as moving as Shakespeare. The performances are top-notch. The cinematography is exquisite. The costumes and sets are wonderfully rich.

130,two-rivers,Before the Fall,10,16 December 1999,"Wars have always dominated the history of the human species, from its early beginnings in the Stone Age up to the days of our modern civilization. An immensity of blood was spilt on the most various justifications, to extend one's own territory, for the sake of possession or maybe out of no apparent reason at all. These vile habits continued throughout the ages; they were backed by policies of bold expansionism like the ones of the Roman Empire or Colonialism, to name but a few. In our century the incessant waves of arms and armours still have not stopped breaking on the shores of mankind; wars and warriors are not exterminated yet. Only the weapons have changed: where first there were some scattered tribes who fought ferociously against each other using rather rudimentary equipment such as roughly cut bones or stones, there are now modern means of warfare, more powerful than ever, with a capability of destruction hardly to be surpassed.The film I want to comment on, ""Ran"" by Akira Kurosawa, reflects all this, the unceasing and senseless carnage of millions of people, man's fury of self-annihilation. The last scene in particular deserves attention: You can see Tsurumaru, a young blind-man, one who has suffered many atrocities, who has traversed the infernos of war and has become its only survivor, stumble along a mountain ridge towards the edge, alone, in front of a wide and open sky, impressively reddened by the sun's setting.And the spectator, still deeply touched by the violent scenes seen before, the bloodshed, the ever-present hunger for power and possession, draws his pessimistic conclusion: this is the dusk of human history; man, who did nothing to stop the move into the fatal direction, who, in his folly, even invented nuclear weapons to hasten his own destruction, is a stumbling blind-man, about to fall into a deep and sombre abyss.",Ran
131,unbend_5440,The Jester said it best,10,2 April 2004,"Inspired by King Lear, Akira Kurosawa created with this, maybe the most complex and dramatic film of his career, and there's a LOT to choose from. Technically speaking, this was the last great Epic to be made. The scale is massive. Not just because of the huge battle scenes in the end, but mostly because of how massive the story was. There are more than a dozen prominent characters, and within the 2:40, every character is properly developed, and each is very distinct. Tatsuya Nakadai, who plays Hidetora, gives one of the most powerful acting performances I've ever seen. Every second he's on screen, even when he's passed out sleeping, he has your complete attention. But luckily because of the great character development that Kurosawa gave us, each character is equally important to the overall story.
There are so many fascinating and intelligent themes played throughout. Most interesting being the theme of loyalty and betrayal. Ultimately that's what the whole film is about. Strangely enough, the themes of loyalty and betrayal are represented best by the characters of Kurogane and The Jester. They have minor parts compared to Hideotora's family, but their actions and the lines they say best sum up the point of this movie. And this is a very deep, heavy, dramatic, fascinating movie. While it's quite a depressing story, and you can't help but feel depressed for ALL the characters, Kurosawa balances the heaviness with jaw dropping visuals. The script is poetic, moving, powerful, and just plain enjoyable. I first saw RAN on a day when I was bored and very exhausted. That didn't prevent me from getting more involved than I have with any movie in years. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen at any moment. When the whole movie was finished, I literally leaned back and took a deep breath. One question I have though. With Decades of experience, was Akira Kurosawa, the most flawless and polished Director who ever lived, LUCKY when he got those incredible shots of soldiers marching while the shadow of the sun and clouds followed behind them? If you see the movie, you'll notice. My favourite line in any Kurosawa movie comes from RAN,""Man is born Crying. When he's cried enough, he dies.""That line was spoked by.......... The Jester.",Ran
132,jaesboxer,"The Greatest Shakespearian Adaptation of All Time, and the Crown Jewel of Akira Kurosawa's Career",10,15 February 2006,"Of all Shakespeare's plays, none excels King Lear. Whilst Hamlet is the true masterpiece of language and poetry, Lear has a true human story unlike anything else in the Bard's writings. And here is the only film adaptation to do this great work justice, a Japanese film by master director Akira Kurosawa. This is the pinnacle of Kurosawa's career. It is a work that directly captures the tragedy of Shakespeare, and is final proof that Kurosawa was unequaled when it came to blending Eastern and Western styles. The story of Lear is transmuted into the story of Lord Ichimonji, who foolishly draws his flattering sons near him, whilst banishing the only one to speak the truth. What ensues is the chaos (Ran) of war, as a clan that Ichimonji built out of blood and death erupts in a power struggle. Ichimonji is the perfect version of Lear, considered by most Shakespearian actors as the hardest and most noteworthy role to play. Here are preserved all the classic elements: the loyalty of the third son (Saburo/Cordelia) in the face of insurmountable treachery, the crazy old man (Ichimonji/Lear) and the wise fool that follows him. Other elements are added, such as the Lady Macbeth like Lady Kaede, whose hatred fuels the ravages of war, the gentle Lady Sue and her blind brother Tsurumaru, both victims of Ichimonji's former wrath. In this film, Kurosawa gives birth to the brilliant vision that is worthy of King Lear. Its imagery is unmatched, and certain scenes, such as the Siege of the First Castle, are remarkable for their savagery, poetry, and tragedy. The final Battle of the Four Armies is unsurpassed in film. For people familiar with the techniques of Sun-tzu, this offers a fascinating glimpse of his strategy in action, with much more depth and planning than the bloodfests in Braveheart or Gladiator. And though the Seven Samurai is still his greatest work, Ran stands as Kurosawa's most complete masterpiece, an epic, a tragedy, and a truly masterful film that shows the vicious circle of destruction that arises out of war and ambition.",Ran

The older two agree to this offer, but the youngest one thinks his father is mad, and doesn't realize that soon the sons will soon be fighting amongst each other for power of the kingdom. The chain of events that follow will drastically change the kingdom of Hidetora forever. Ran is one of the most captivating, beautifully filmed masterpieces since movies started to be made in color.

He is a master in the art of filmmaking, no one can film an epic battle scene quite like Kurosawa. This is recognized as the most expensive film ever made by Akira Kurosawa, it was at that time, Japan's most expensive film ever. Being at the age of 75, he still showed us, he's one of the best in the business.This movie is about an aging lord, head of the Ichimonji family, decides to retire and to pass the power to Taro, the eldest of his three sons. He will however have to banish Saburo, the youngest one, who dared to speak the truth to him. Soon, the former lord is chased away from the castles of his sons and becomes mad when he understands that one of his sons is trying to kill him. The three brothers are fighting for control of the Kingdom, as their lust for power grows every day. Four armies are facing each other on the prairie. Lord Ichimonji's former peaceful kingdom is nothing but a distant memory.Akira Kurosawa redefines what an epic film is, with astonishing story telling, entirely believable characters and real life battle scenes without the use of Special effects/CGI. He retells the story of King Lear in his own way and no one would recognize that it was actually a adaptation beforehand. But just like Shakespeare, there is humor, irony, death and not a happy ending. Everyone who played a part in the production of this film, deserves some kind of recognition.

They have so much texture and tone. They have so much depth and character. I just recently watched ""Rashomon."" That is a very beautiful film. He is able to use color equally as effective. Every color is perfectly arranged. Like a painter, he composes each scene, each frame with tender affection. I doubt you can find a better looking film. The ending of the film is the most cynical, the most depressing, the most emotive of any film I have ever seen. It has stayed with me ever since I first saw it. Kurosawa, near the end of his career, has ostensibly lost all faith in human kind. There is no goodness. There is no decency. There is no hope. All that is left is meaningless suffering.

The battles rage a little too long for my liking, and take the story away. The film is very long and tends to drag, with some of the dialogue adding to the plodding pace.The story revolves around a warlord and his sons who vie for power, resulting in much bloodshed and strife. There is a jester who adds comic relief, and his wild antics are quite the bizarre contrast to the otherwise serious tone of the film.Kurosawa fans should watch this, but alone it is not the most impressive story, even as a retelling of Shakespeare.

Lady Kaede is certainly a great role and she throws herself into it completely.  As for the film itself, Kurosawa's epic story manages to survive the film's overly long running time and preoccupation with stage blood.

Her character is so ruthless it almost defies belief. The scene in which she pulls a knife on Lord Jiro is one that gives me goosebumps whenever I think of it, and one of my top 3 scenes in any film.This is a film that treats the viewer as an intelligent adult, and has the density of content to repeatedly reward.

Rarely in modern film has such an evil and unsympathetic character been rendered with such an unerring pathos.  Kudos to Harada (who would have won an Oscar with this performance in an English-language film) and to Kurosawa for making this one of the indisputable cornerstones of film art.",Ran
143,sherbetsaucers,Awe Inspiring,10,6 February 2007,"At the core of this movie there is a long running philosophical question. Certain characters continually question what is happening around them, and through these questions, the themes of the movie are forthcoming. The most obvious theme is that of war. Here, once again, Kurosawa reminds us that modern warfare is not a place of honour or duels, but massed attacks on faceless enemies, shooting each other from a distance. I will discuss the battle scenes later in this review; they help us examine the chaos that is again consistent throughout the film. It seems that no one in this movie has any control over the events that are transpiring; not even the ultimate manipulator Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede has true control. This lack of control seems to mirror the idea put forward by the only character who is continually able to tell the truth without ramification. Shinnosuke Ikehata (credited here as Peter) is the fool who says 'Are there no gods... no Buddha? If you exist, hear me. You are mischievous and cruel! Are you so bored up there you must crush us like ants? Is it such fun to see men weep?' Even if god exists then the only pleasure he enjoys is watching mankind destroy itself in the chaotic mess that is war. The final scenes see chaos erupt, as through the good natured actions of one man, 4 armies are dragged into a bloody battle. Which leads us to the idea of futility and death. The pointlessness of life is summed up once again by the fool. 'Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies.' Death comes to us all, yet it is far bleaker than that. If there is a god then they allow everyone to suffer. Even a noble character, like Saburo, dies an ignoble and futile death. Everyone within this movie is both hunter and hunted. It is a bleak world indeed.Then we have morality. There are very few 'good' characters here, but there are three exceptions to this. Saburo, Lord Hidetora's third and youngest son, who because of his love and loyalty to his father is unable to not speak out at the foolishness he sees around him, which leads to his banishment. Tango, a loyal servant to Lord Hidetora who is banished with Saburo, but through love for his lord disguises himself so as to stay near him. Finally there is Kyoami, the fool. He again is loyal to his Lord, however, he voices ideas of leaving his side numerous times, but again his sense of duty and even affection keep him with his master.The movie itself is near perfect. Stylistically it is almost like watching a play. Both the staging and the style of acting are clearly very influenced by Japanese Noh theatre, with the slow and deliberate style of acting used, and the mask-like appearance of age notable in the make up of Nakadai as the seventy year old Hiderota. Every shot looks like a masterpiece, perfectly framed. Kurosawa trained as an artist, indeed he painted the storyboard for every shot in the film. The framing is perfect and in most senses the camera does not move at all, or if it does, it is simply to keep the perfection of the shot intact. Kurosawa was a master film maker, this is clear throughout. His confidence with film is breathtaking: only a director totally sure in his craft would dare leave the long, motionless pauses at the end of almost every scene, punctuating what has just happened and allowing the audience to grasp the full implication of the actions taking place.Kurosawa is, of course, well known for his ability to direct action, and this movie recreates war in a way few others have ever managed to do. There are two great battles here, one in the middle and one during the end. The final battle is perfectly staged, riveting, and speaks volumes of the futility that the lust and pride of Jiro Masatoras, Hiderotas second son (played by Jinpachi Nezu) has led to. But for me it is the first battle that is the one of the greatest moments in cinema. Due to council given by a traitor, Lord Hidetora has led his household, which includes 30 warriors, to the castle of the outcast Saburo. It is a trap, and Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), his first son and Jiro strike. What follows is horrific. This is the purist language of movie, and a thing of true genius. On the battlefield, even in the world of the Samurai, there is no honour, no real glory, only ugliness and death.It is interesting to note that seeing someone actually kill another person in this movie is rare. Considering the acclaim Kurosawa has garnered for the sword fighting sequences in so many of his movies it is interesting to note that not once do you see a sword kill another person on screen. Indeed, there are only two times we really witness one person attacking and killing another, other than mutual suicide. The first is entirely shown at a massive distance, the figures barely distinguishable, and the second, despite being amazingly gory, does not actually show the death itself on camera.Yet with all of this emphasis on framing, shot, symbolism and colour, Kurosawa manages to bring to the screen some of the greatest performances I think I have ever witnessed. I have to cut short my praise of what is a faultless cast and talk about Mieko Harada giving perhaps the finest performance in the movie. Driven by anger and vengeance she becomes something other than human, she is some kind of succubus, a temptress, a fox-spirit. Harada is at all times compelling, her every movement one of cold perfection and as we hear her silk robes rustling as she glides along the wooden floors we see before us an unforgettable creation of pure evil.",Ran
144,Abyss47,Kurosawa's last epic is an extraordinary achievement.,10,7 July 2013,"Saw this for the first time today, courtesy of the StudioCanal Blu-ray, which looked and sounded fantastic on my set-up.Great, great film. I'm not entirely familiar with the story of King Lear, but I thought ""Ran"" had a wonderful story with all kinds of layers. It was almost overwhelming for me at times as I was trying to keep up with all the various character names and motivations. The photography was so lush and colorful as well, probably the best-looking Kurosawa film I've seen to date. Then again, this is the first one I've seen in color. The framing of shots, the scope and scale, all of it was just so.....magnificent. I love huge epics like this which have so much to them in regards to subject matter; this one deals with loyalty, family, and the bloodthirsty nature of war, among other things, and in the sort of poetic way that would make Shakespeare proud. The battle sequences are stunning and somehow manage to be beautiful and brutal at the same time because of the way they're filmed and the use of music. The score is very haunting; I thought it was used best in the big battle scene towards the middle of the film which causes Hidetora to go mad. I was even smiling during it because the execution was so breathtaking; the type that makes your eyes widen. And the opening set the mood extremely well; I knew from that point on I was watching a film that would instantly become a favorite. I'm glad I blind-bought it, because I will definitely be seeing it more than once.",Ran

First of all why did some of the samurai have guns? samurai didn't use guns, its against their honor, something Akira knows nothing about, just like Seven Samurai, the worst movie ever made, worse then this pile of bull. Its also disgraceful to Shakespeare's great story, something deserving of a much better film. This movie was made in 1985 so why is Akira stuck in 1950, at least thats what it looked and felt like, it had no meaning, no point, and it was boring, almost as much as 2001. 0 out of a 10 for this and Akira.",Ran

Don't get me wrong, this isn't Kurosawa's greatest film( that still goes to Derzu Uzala ), but its an amazing epic that I'd watch with gusto over skipping past all the Gladiator's or Bravehearts you threw at me. Kurosawa directed an epic thats not only stunning but viscerally entertaining and elegantly sad. Scenes like the attack on Hideotora, the opening credits with its shots of warriors sitting quietly atop horses, or the final scene involving Lady Kaede achieve an almost operatic grandeur that shows the work of one of cinemas true craftsmen.

Yet this movie was too long, tried imagery too hard and did not engage me either with the King Lear story (and the characters' stupidity), nor the acting (with the exception of a few supportive actors), and even the cinematography (ok, the opening and the closing shots are impressive, and so are the colors in the fight scenes). The war scenes (and man, are there a lot of them) are particularly bad with endless repetition of the same implausible actions.

The man's ouevre isn't that wonderful.... there's nothing too terribly Japanese about the films (except for the uneasy superimposition the traditional lore, pomp and pageantry). Also: no American director would get away with filming only battles and their contexts. It's no surprise that vacuous 'thrill' artists like John Sturges and George Lucas used K's films as 'inspiration' for their empty Hollywood confections. There' just nothing else there. Would it surprise you to know that his films were despised and UNPOPULAR in JAPAN (!!). Patently overrated. That's how Kurosawa's unfathomable influence started, with a bunch of pseudo-art conscious Americans in the fifties confusing 'exoticism' with blatant and planned pandering to American tastes.

155,deng43,not really Shakespeare,7,6 April 2008,"a peerless cinematic/visual experience. i can name very few films that have even a couple of scenes to compare; lawrence of arabia does, but the list is tiny. and this film just keeps them coming and coming.my reason for a seven is that the film is a failure as Shakespeare. being sadly monolingual i cannot speak to the stunning beauty that other languages probably offer when crafted in the right hands, and maybe the Japanese language version of this sings as sweetly as william does in English... toward the end when the fool rails against the gods i heard my wife mutter: 'as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for sport.' now that hits an English speaker full on. the fools rant, though meant to express the same thought is comparatively empty.this brings me to another reviewer's point: Shakespeare's very language evokes the images needed to bring life to the ideas right inside your mind with a sort of 'uhuh!' flash. he pours into your ear his gold and the empty stage comes alive. kurosawa is trying to do this with the images foremost. they are beautiful beyond words. it is stunning. but it isn't Shakespeare. we have the ideas like vanity and treachery, we have the wonderful visuals framing them, and we have the actors coming across in maxed-out melodrama mode. This is not madness, not a soul seething with demons. it is histrionic flailing.i think perhaps the Japanese cultural approach to the very idea of madness is not accessible to us in our usual western terms. it may be that an appearance of high melodrama is as close as we can come on this issue. the cultures simply don't see the same thing when they look. the film makes me glad bette davis never did Shakespeare.sorry, kurosawa fans, i love him, too, but this one misses as badly on the verbal level as it transcends on the visual.",Ran
156,letrias,War is hell - Kurosawa is a cinematic god.,10,28 August 2002,"Massive SPOILER ahead.A truly wonderful study of war.  It is a story about what should have been a simple family feud, but because of the position of the family in question in the Japanese hierarchy many thousands of people have to die senseless deaths.  It's especially significant to note that, like in almost every war in human history, the leaders who were responsible for the carnage do not die until the very end.  It is an incredible relief to finally see them die, and perhaps that is the only element of the ending that makes it a rather ""happy"" one.  It's difficult not to feel sorry for them when it happens, yet it is the most satisfying feeling knowing that had they been killed much earlier, then so many innocent people would have been spared.  The scene that symbolizes this theme best is that of the fallen emperor as he walks away untouched from a battle, in which everyone, including all of his best warriors, and his wives, is killed.  They all die because of a decision he made, yet he is the only one who survives - what a wonderful, and true to life, irony it is.This is quite likely the best war film ever made, matched only by Hoffman's ""Deluge"" and Chen Kaige's ""Emperor & The Assassin"", although neither of these other two films made such a powerful philosophical statement.  It is Kurosawa's greatest work, and far more mature and interesting than any of his previous work.  ""Seven Samurai"" was fun, and most popular amongst american audiences, but hardly his best film, even ""Hidden Fortress"" was more cinematically interesting.  ""Ran"" is simply magnificent.  A true work of art.",Ran
157,Colin0001,It all started here,9,20 November 2004,"My love for film that is. When I saw this almost 20 years ago, I realised that art was something different to what I'd previously imagined. I recently watched this again, and time has indeed been kind to this film. I was yet again totally enthralled by the sweeping vistas and clever action. Even though it was an interpretation of a Shakespearean play,it still came across as fresh and vivid. It takes a brave artist to feel they could add to Shakespeare's work. This film is a success at every level. The slow treachery that builds up is exquisite to watch. As with all Japanese films, the theme of loss is recurrent all through the film. But its the pacing that sets this film above and beyond the reach of others. From start to finish it is a treat for the eye and for the mind. A superb, stunning piece of work.",Ran
158,ajoyce1va,"Daimyo Lear has no daughters, but lots of problems with his sons",5,5 September 2008,"It's interesting to read the earlier reviews for Ran on this forum: the artsy-minded love it, while the roller derby fans hate it. I didn't hate it but must agree that there's enough bad acting from Nakadai to make you want to hold your nose, and lots of terrible writing. For example, we see Hidetora, stumbling around in volcano-land in a preposterous white wig, as he comes out of his stupor to announce ""I am lost,"" and his Fool replies ""Such is the Human Condition."" Oh, come on! And some of the actions sequences aren't much better. In the first battle, Tora's captain magically gets inside the castle and opens the gates. As the disaster proceeds, a guardsman comes up to report to Hidetora, finishes his message and as he tries to stagger back to the battle, he dies theatrically right there on the floor. And finally, while the castle burns, Kurosawa shows us pile after pile of bloody, artistically arranged corpse pin-cushions. Yeah, we got the point; get on with the story!But I wouldn't rate Ran as totally awful because there is much to admire in this film. Many of the domestic scenes show classic Japanese good taste, and the battle sequences are nothing short of amazing. And while I wouldn't care to get it on with ferocious Lady Kaede as (already married) Jiro does, I loved her character as one of the main forces behind the downfall of the House of Ichimonji. Best of all was the cinematography. Most of Kurosawa's greatest work was in black and white, but clearly his understanding of color composition was masterful. If I could keep the court intrigue, the good exterior scenes in the high country, and the battles and cut out all the Hidetora-gone-mad rubbish, I would have enjoyed this movie.As it was, after over two and a half hours of this stuff, my wife provided the best assessment. As the final credits rolled, she turned to me and said, ""Well, that was depressing!""P.S. An earlier reviewer commented on the anachronistic use of firearms in this film, complaining that samurai would not have used them. Well, yes and no. True 16th Century samurai as shown in this film would have done their work with sword, bow, and lance, but characters like Saburo and Fujimaki would not have scorned the use of men-at-arms with rifles. What was absurd in the final battle sequence was the rate of fire -- impossible for Saburo's small force.",Ran

The DVD quality was horrible, so that might have contributed to my dislike, but I really didn't like this film at all. It was very touhg to get through...I had to watch it in pieces, because I could not take it in doses longer than 30 minute stretches. The acting is horrible throughout, the plot is like a bad soap opera set in Samurai-land, and the visuals, while artistic and nice to look at, are heavy-handed, distracting, and slow down this already tedious film. Had this been an American production, people would bash it beyond all repair...compare it to other 1985 films for example ""Back to the Future"", and it pales miserably. The dialogue, the comedy, the action...all amateurish. I know it's Kurosawa and he can do great things, but this one was no good and seems like an aging director trying to do something grand and wonderful, and like Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather III"", this one fails and is not even worthy of being compared to something like ""Seven Samurai.""

161,Chihir0,A Shakespearean story presented in the genius way by Kurosawa,8,11 June 2015,"The story follows the period when an old warlord decides to find peace by giving space to younger blood. Hidetora decides to divide the kingdom in three parts to his songs. A castle for a son. Two older boys are satisfied with the decision to inherit a part of kingdom. But the younger son argues with the wisdom of a such of decision. The first thought for him was how reckless and shameless is the boy. But how much time will pass until we see an ambitious brother that want the whole kingdom? What can a wrong decision cause?A very interesting story. I think it can be a great lesson for many people, how excessive ambition, thoughtlessness and war for power can cause fatality.I've seen some of Kurosawa films in black and white, but this time I was surprised with his cinematographic work. Every visual detail was perfect. Costumes, places, colors, castles are incredible. Every single detail is made with dedication. I liked so much that he didn't use music a lot, especially during the war part. I felt like I was into the war with Hidetora. The war scene was epic.Acting was great too.

The elder two soon turn against the Lord and each other, each vying for full control of the land. Another masterpiece from Kurosawa, while I didn't enjoy it as much as another one of his Shakespearian adaptations, Thrown of Blood, it's still up there with his best films. Another stunning film, it's a sharp contrast to his earlier black and white films with stark, gritty cinematography. Ran is shot in colour with lots of bright reds, yellows and blue's to help give the film a unique, artistic look, more of an achievement when you consider that Kurosawa was almost completely blind when he directed it. Tatsuya Nakadai was electrifying as the tragic Great Lord with a layered performance packed with emotion. Just an epic film, can not recommend it enough.",Ran

The story simply deals with a tyrant dictator who raged war against many people, perhaps some were innocent,and now it is his time to pay back. The acting is good.... yet less impressive that other Kurasawa movies. I just couldn't love, hate or admire any of the characters. The camera tells the story in a beautiful way but sometimes it is just too far away to tell who is who.... one can only know by the color code if the banner! The battle scenes were magnificent, and even though too short lived, were the most interesting part of the movie. Overall, It is still worth the 2hrs and 40 min.

164,nskanyal,Japanese cinema at its best - a gift from Akira Kurosawa,9,21 December 2008,"Last night, I had this rare fortune of watching one more of Akira Kurosawa's magic ""Ran"". If you still haven't been able to lay your hands on it, make it the first thing on your priority list. How I wish, ""Seven Samurai"" could have been made in color. This movie is a pure joy to watch  as good as are other attributes of the movie, the cinematographic excellence leaves any other movie ever made so far behind. I have liked ""The Last Samurai"" for its imagery and amazing color presentation, but even that movie pales if compared to ""Ran"". Opening scene is spellbinding - music score along with those moments of deafening silence is way too good. No doubt, it was the most expensive Japanese film ever made. Lord Hidetora is superiorly awesome (especially when he turns mad) and Lady Kaede at times seems to be even more ruthless than Nurse Ratched (was in ""One flew over cuckoo's nest""). Also, so many subtle and some not so-subtle references to Buddha are timely and apt. However, I would confess that movie is not perfect - the attack on the third castle is more or less ordinary, and I do wonder how even in that wilderness, Kyoami was able to maintain squeaky clean clothes for himself and his master. So, if you really love movies, go and grab it - a movie must to watch before you die!!!",Ran
165,diffusionx,A Glorious Tale,10,3 March 2001,"Ran is a movie I have wanted to see for a long time, and, after seeing it, I feel privileged. It is a grand achievement for Kurosawa, and a wonderful film.As the movie unfolds, it is spectacularly easy to identify with each character - even the more malicious ones (this does the job of making one care about the good and despise the bad all that much more easily). Each character says what needs to be said to get the right thing across, and no more. The movie seems to be made gently, and with great care. And it's something that works, in every single shot of the movie.
One thing I love about Kurosawa films is how simple, but how effective the cinematography is. I cant help but mention it here. Compared to overdone and all-too-mobile camerawork in movies like Gladiator, Ran's camerawork is simplicity defined. For the most part, it simply sits there, as a casual observer. It doesn't move all that much, but that just means that, when it does, its all the more important. The way the camera moves in and out throughout scenes truly do enhance the movie, and give it even more life. Kurosawa truly was a master at using the camera to enhance the story, rather then just show it.Yes, the performances are excellent. The sets and costumes are incredibly beautiful. The battle scenes are epic and have influenced many a director, I am sure. The tale is grand, epic, and amazingly well translated to the movie screen. But there's more to Ran then just that. It's just an absolutely stunning motion picture. It jumps out of the screen, and is full of life. And it's so much better than just about any other Shakespeare play adapted to the film screen (especially the overly pretentious ""Titus"") by Hollywood. Ran is a movie that needs to be seen. It's also a fitting exclamation point (he made other films, but this is his last ""big"" one) to the career of one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live.",Ran
166,jminer,Kurosawa at his grandest,10,4 October 2000,"Ran means chaos in Japanese.  Instead of taking the story of King Lear and focusing on the central character as that title does, Kurosawa has chosen to name his film after its setting: a world of chaos unleashed by the pride and ignorance of a former warlord. Discovering what it is to be human, while hurtling around in a universe without rules or borders, is a theme that Kurosawa loved.  You can find it most accessibly in Andrei Konchalovsky's film Runaway Train, based on a Kurosawa screenplay.  The strength that evil has, if we allow it; the futility of so many things in which people believe; the redeeming power of love: these meant as much to Shakespeare in King Lear as they do to Kurosawa in Ran. Yet there is great beauty here - most of it associated with the pomp and circumstance of battling armies, and most of it belied by the violence they do.  The background, the universe in which Lord Hidemoto scuttles like a proud, crippled, spider, is blank; brown and grey in colour, but bereft of landmark. Just as, after Shakespeare's Act I, Lear never sets foot in a building; just as Ahab and Ishmael, having left Nantucket, never set foot upon land; so Hidemoto is cast out into darkness. Music, costume, cast, battle action: so good it's hard to remember you're watching a foreign film. This is film-making at its grandest and most universal.

Extremely high quality costumes, actors, scenery, plot, battles... But none of it comes together because the movie has very limited soul, passion or spirit. It just sort of ""happens"" like it's on rails.It's as if the cast and crew had already decided it would be exceptionally good so they just showed up, did their thing and released it to an audience they already knew would fall over themselves to be overawed and enraptured by it.Worth trudging through if you're a Kurosawa completist (in which case you've probably already decided it's a breathtaking, life-changing experience) but otherwise stick with the movies he made when he was young and on fire.",Ran

But I like Akira Kurosawas work and so this was a must watch for me. I mean I knew the basic plot line of King Lear, but thats it.
So obvious there where many twists and moments that I didnt expect or that I imagined to turn out different.But lets start at the beginning.
Just the first shot of this movie was so incredible beautiful and I directly knew that this movie is something special. The entire movie was shot so beautiful, like you can stop it at almost any second and have an incredible shot you could turn into a poster.The actors delivered an amazing performance and you can really empathize with them. During the time of this movie some of the characters really grow and continue to evolve, so you really start loving some of them and you just feel sad for them during some occasions. And some characters you start to hate more and more as the movie continues. And the ending... It just hits really hard, for me at least.There are some amazing battlescenes in it and you could only imagine how much work went into it. And the locations where they shot, magnificent. They build an entire castle for the movie, just to burn it down. Or they shot at real historical places and I was just baffled by how amazing everything looks. The cinematography was just great, as everything elseThe plot has a nice pace and it really never felt boring or dragged out and how I said, there where some moments that I did not expect.For me it was an amazing experience and it is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Without hesitation I would recommend everyone to check it out. 10/10",Ran
170,BenGW1,"One of the very best ""train wreck"" movies ever",9,16 September 2001,"RAN is a classic film and a classic example of what I like to call ""train wreck"" movies. In a ""train wreck"" film, the situation is obviously headed straight into disaster and the audience wants to scream to the characters to get off the tracks (whatever happens to serve as the metaphorical tracks in their situations) and prevent a catastrophe. A ""train wreck"" film is not like Roger Ebert's Idiot Plot example, where the film would be over and all problems solved if everyone involved wasn't an idiot. The characters in RAN are not idiots. They make bad decisions, and decisions that seemed good but are subverted and manipulated by malicious men and women, and when things go to hell they do become crazed and non-lucid. But the Lord had good intentions, forgetting what sort of travel route good intentions are used to construct.RAN understands also that film characters, like most real human beings, are a mix of good and evil. The three sons make bad decisions and end up destroying each other, but they also realize how horrible their actions are and regret them (only not enough to stop the train wreck from happening). Lady Kaede is as close to 100% evil as I've seen at the movies, yet even she is acting not as a stereotypical harridan, but as a subtle manipulator whose avenue for creating destruction is opened up by other forces. Metaphors could be drawn from RAN to a lot of modern-day situations where different factions battle for a lot of reasons, and paramount among them is the inability to see a word where they're NOT battling.The combat scenes in this movie are stunning, and have been well-described elsewhere; suffice it to say that BRAVEHEART and GLADIATOR owe their Best Picture Oscars to the choreography of costuming, editing, cinematography, and fake blood (lots of it) here, to say nothing of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. RAN is an incredible film, and it's not always fun to watch, but it's unforgettable in its poetry of a great family reduced to savagery.",Ran

This silly film looks like something from 1935.  Please don't tell me this is great art.  If a black kid from Chicago made it, it would have never seen daylight.  Films should be judged in the context of the period they were made in.  The thing that makes a great film, domestic or foreign, is the ultimate watchability of the piece.  If you can watch this without fast forwarding, you have either fallen asleep or you are forcing your eyes open.  There is no pleasure here.Great war scenes?  Please.  Lame and silly are more like it.

172,danielatala8,"What a magnificent movie, I'm speechless",9,24 August 2021,"I really wish that colour was invented even before so that we could've seen Akira Kurosawa's other movies in colour- cause the way he uses the shots and fills it with so much life is just so gorgeous, even more apparent in Ran.I must say I'm not familiar with the Shakespeare play King Lear which I read this movie is based on but I feel that this story just is super deep, touches upon themes of honesty- betrayal and most of all who are the people that really love you vs the ones that don't.Masterfully acted with a tight and talented ensemble, amazing breathtaking costumes (and I do mean AMAZING)- not a single second of this movie is wasted, although I myself felt that it started to slouch a bit during the end It still feels that every second has its purpose.This movie has a LOT of tragedy and little to no moments of happiness, and that's ok because it is a human story- a study on greed and love. Thank you for your art Kurosawa, you're amazing!",Ran
173,Madluke91,"Crushing, yet ultimately humane and beautiful film.",10,30 September 2010,"Ran is in my opinion Kurosawas most epic films in the mammoth scale of what it tries to tackle. All in one it is a crushing film trying to display the hopenlessness of humanity; the hypocrisy of hierarchy, the lack of morality within our societal structures, the greed and lust for power. Religion gets thrown in, and it's an anti-war film all in one. You might not take it all in, you don't need to, you take what you want from it and no more. It's impossible to sum it all up in one review, and impossible to grasp all in one viewing.Kurosawa is most definitely a genius with a camera that's for sure, although i've heard this film described as 'clunky'. I'd definitely put it under vibrant, very colourful and the shots throughout are exquisite. Tatsuya Nakadai puts in one of the best performances of all time, and his portrayal of suffering and almost the loss of soul is impeccable, and some of the shots of him are unforgettable. The cogs are kept turning by the spontaneity of the whole thing, each step assuredly moving us one rung up the ladder, but without revealing the exact locale of the next.The film is definitely a film of segments; we start out with the merciless lord Hidetora out boar hunting with his three sons, and two rival clan faction leaders. Hidetora is old and falls asleep after the hunt. He dreams a crushing dream - almost a prophetic dream - of himself walking aimlessly in a field with no voice able to hear him; lonely. The inevitable outcome of his ruthless life, and his bad karma perhaps, would be his own downfall. He was blind to everything around him but his own power. So although notably shook up, he hastily forgets about it.His three sons are of very different characters, and he gives the head status of his clan to his eldest son, and thus also the land to his eldest son. The youngest son is forth rite in his words and proclaims he must be senile if he thinks power of such magnitude can be passed on so easily; without any bad feeling, even amongst brothers, and as such he is exiled. His father was so blind to all around him that he couldn't accept he could be wrong, and furthermore took it as a threat.The second stage of the film is when the soul crushing venture really begins as the naivety of Lord Hidetoya's decisions bear fruition, war soon breaks out, and he is completely stripped bear, and the fall of himself and all around him slowly commences. It's the beginning of his humbling in position to put it lightly.If there is one thing this film certainly is, it is anti-war. The main real focus on war is the sheer hypocrisy and irony which surrounds it. That doesn't mean to say that there aren't epic battles because there sure are, but there is something more mystical and poignant in them far beyond a grandiose scope of a battle.Hidetoya's closest companion ends up being the fool, whom says to the mighty Lord ""A bird traded it's speckled and dirty egg for that of the pristine white egg of a snake"" ""The white egg hatched, and the baby snake ate the bird""  Beauty definitely isn't on the outside, it's on the inside, and this is said at Hidetoya's most humbling of moments. The man once adorned in his white and golden robes, he whom thought of himself as closest to the gods, and would have ruled as a complete dictator, had a complete role reversal with a man whom was living his life out making a fool of himself for others entertainment. His outer grandiose state no longer meant anything when when removed from his pedestal.",Ran
174,Rokol,cinematic perfection,10,5 January 2005,"I have had the pleasure to watch Ran twice this year. I purchased the 2 set DVD about 9 months ago and I must say it was worth the heavy price. The second time I viewed this masterpiece pleased me just as much as the first time I've watched it. The direction is stunning (ofcourse it is: KUROSAWA!!!)and the costumes, sets and colors are all state of the art. I haven't had the opportunity to read King Lear but I sure want to give it a try. Although Ran is not my favorite Kurosawa film (I would say it's Ikiru)I think it is his second best film. I only defeats seven samurai with a few inches, and that's because i think the story is more interesting and obviously the battle scenes are a bit more realistic.But all in all he made so many great movies it is hard to decide which one is his masterpiece. But Ran sure belongs to his best films. 5/5 stars.",Ran
175,pggirasole,The final defeat of the leaders,9,9 May 2015,"The first thing that I realized while I was watching ""Ran"" was that this movie should be considered one of the masterpieces both of Kurosawa and world cinema. The reason is simple. A perfect adaptation of a Western tragedy by a a director from the other corner of the world, and centuries later, with the liet motiv of Kurosawa's production in it.That's to say the bad habits of the leading classes that destroy themselves by themselves. Like a curse. If is not the case of Washizu condemned by the fate, the same one he wanted to destroy with his Lady in ""Throne of Blood"", as well as Jiro and his Lady Kaede, a perfect portrait of Japanese femme fatale, in this movie; or the decadence of an industrial family in the ""Bad sleep well"", as the one of Ichimonji clan in this case, the idea doesn't change. The ones that try to be powerful and are too sure to reach success, as the brigands in the ""Seven Samurai"" or the Takeda clan officials in ""Kagemusha"" will fail and will end as villains or fools. On the other hand, the poors show to survive as in the case of the fool jester of Ran, that, even if he was considered mad, in a madden world without value, will result, after the cloud were drifted away, the real winner. Even without an armour and a castle. Or, still better, without a wicked Lady ready to lick his wounds not to relieve but to soak blood. As can be seen in a breathtaking scene of fight and subsequent passion between Kaede and Jiro.The real fool and poor ones. With ""Ran"", so, the battle of the villains started in ""Seven Samurai"" seems to be resolved. And the losers are them, the leaders. And the weapon is their arrogance. The Greek play writers called it hybris and thought was the cause of the chaos. Japanese call it RAN.",Ran

177,Studio Morye Reviews,Nigh-perfection,10,21 February 2001,"I have always been a lover of Japanese cinema but it rarely went beyond anything frivolous like GODZILLA or certain Anime (Princess Mononoke is not frivolous). But in August, 2000, I awoke early in the morning. Armed with a bowl of cereal and a newspaper, I looked over the showtimes to see which theatres were showing ""Godzilla 2000"". Something else caught my eye, though. It was a tiny little box with the words ""Akira Kurosawa's RAN, 15th anniversary"". I had heard the name ""Kurosawa"" before and as a filmmaker to-be, I was very interested. But I had never seen any of his films.Well, to cut a long story short, I was sitting in the Egyptian theatre with my father during the evening the next day. And it was brilliant. It had humor, it had drama, it had heart-wrenchingly detailed and exceedingly horrifying scenes of epic violence. This is truly the work of a genius, and when one takes into consideration that the widower Kurosawa was almost blind and 75 when he made RAN we cannot help but bow down to the mighty power of Japan's premier filmmaker.The story of King Lear set into Feudal Japanese times, RAN takes a leap in all terms. It has three-dimensional characters, unpredictable plot twists, highly meticulous scene setups and brilliant dialogue. For fear of giving anything away, I won't say much more. Just watch this movie if you get a chance. You'll not regret it.",Ran
178,arenn,Truly Spectacular,10,2 October 2000,"Note: some SPOILERS for the first part of the film.I just saw a new print of Ran showing as part of a 15th anniversary celebration of the film.  I'd never seen it before, but because the name ""Kurosawa"" was on this it, my expectations were sky high.  Well, I was not disappointed.As you are surely aware by now, Ran is a Kurosawa's adaptation of King Lear, transferred to medieval Japan.  An aging warlord named Hidetora attempts to leave his kingdom to his three sons and enjoy a happy retirement.  Things immediately go awry.  The youngest son Saburo, a brash, outspoken youth, challenges his father's decision, saying in so many words that the father had trained the sons too well.  Raised to imitate their amoral butcher of a father, they would ultimately turn on him.  This incensed Hidetora, who banished Saburo (along with a close advisor who dared speak up in agreement with young Sab) and went through with the plan.Unfortunately, Saburo turns out to be right and the film proceeds to show the tragedy of Hidetora's decision.  Not only do Hidetora's sons turn against him, his entire family has enemies who've been waiting years to avenge themselves against them for Hidetora's past brutal conquests.Ran has the feel of a great Shakespearean tragedy.  Many of the scenes could have been stage sets, or perhaps more accurately opera.  Note the bright colors and lavish costumes set in contrast with the bleak storyline, the bigger than life emotions, the extremity of loyalty and betrayal, and the cataclysmic finale, all very reminiscent of a tragic opera.  I was left emotionally drained by the time it was all over.Visually, Ran is stunning.  I mentioned the exceptional use of color and costumes already.  But the shots of the landscapes, sky, and castles are likewise incredible.  The characters often make reference to the gods and in Kurosawa's nature shots, you almost get the impression that they are close by, gathering to watch these sad happenings.Additionally, Ran features the best - I repeat, THE BEST - battle scenes I have ever witnessed.  The music, choreography, and cinematography combine to create two major battles so incredible I think I could just sit there and watch them in a loop for hours on end.  The only problem with them (and one of the few weaknesses of the film in general) is the overuse of buckets of blood, much of which looks fake.The acting was wonderful, especially Mieko Harada who stole the show as the ultra-manipulative Lady Kaede.  Tatsuya Nakadai was also great as the animated Lord Hidetora.There's an awful lot that could be written about this film, but with limited space, I'll leave it with this: watch this film, preferably on the big screen.  FYI: Rumor has it that the DVD of Ran is complete garbage, so do your due diligence before buying.",Ran
179,Miura88,A glorious achievement by Kurosawa,3,19 March 2009,"Akira Kurosawa had given the world so much throughout the 50's and 60's: Seven Samurai, Throne Of Blood, Ikiru, Rashomon, Yojimbo to name a few. These are 5 brilliant movies in their own right that any director would want to have had their name attached to in any way, shape or form.But the 70's, 80's and 90's seemed to be difficult for Kurosawa to make movies: He only made 7 films from 1970 up until his death in 1998. He was getting trouble for funding his movies, some people criticised him for being too western and old-fashioned. Kurosawa even attempted suicide at one point, but thankfully he survived. He had wanted to make ""Ran"" for over a decade, but he couldn't find the funding, until Serge Silberman helped him out with the funding.So it was 10 years in the planning, the entire storyboard was painted by Kurosawa, the costumes were designed by Kurosawa and created over a 2 year period, 1400 extras and 200 horses were used in the battle scenes, Kurosawa's wife even died during the production of the film. After all the difficulty in making the film, how did ""Ran"" turn out? Extremely well, extremely well indeed.Ran is the story of Hidetora Ichimonji, a powerful Warlord in feudal Japan. A man who has spent almost his entire life fighting for control, and has decided to hand over his power to his 3 sons, hoping to restore peace to the land after a lifetime of bloodshed. However, his youngest son Saburo voices his concerns bluntly, which Hidetora does not appreciate: He banishes Saburo and one of his vassals who defended Saburo (The fiercely loyal Tango).What follows is a glorious exploration of greed, sexual politics, ambition, madness, loyalty, corruption, war, faith and revenge. Beautifully photographed, hauntingly scored, with incredible acting and brilliant direction culminate into one of the most emotionally shattering and incredible movies ever made. Not only is it the best film Akira Kurosawa ever made, it is also one of the greatest movies ever made. Akira Kurosawa has cemented his place as one of the greatest director's of all time with this film.",Ran

181,JJTTbean,A new King Lear by a legend of a director,10,9 September 1998,"Mr. Kurosawa, perfectionist that he was, certainly put all he had into the film ""Ran"".  It is an incredibly creative update of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" that takes place in a war-ridden Japanese culture.  Instead of the King bequeathing his castles and lands to his three ""loving"" daughters who then marry horribly corrupt husbands, Akira Kurosawa has the Japanese King bequeath his castles and lands to three ""loving"" sons who then marry corrupt harpy wives.The most beautiful aspect of the film is the fantastic imagery in which Kurosawa delights so zealously.  The opening war scene of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" seems to have been lifted directly from Kurosawa's ""Ran"" wherein a horrorifically blugeoning war seems to be taking place in a dream-like state.  Kurosawa also has spectacularly vibrant colours so as to use them to vividly punctuate every aspect of the film.To produce Shakespeare alone is an amazing feat; but to be able to interpret Shakespeare via the ancient Japanese culture is pure brilliance.  This is one of Akira Kurosawa's definitive films and that which will keep him alive for generations to come.",Ran

185,kelshawd,Ran,9,26 September 2006,"﻿ RanThe story opens with a hunting expedition. The men are of royalty. They sit in the fields surrounded by the King's accouterments and dine, discussing political matters, when the king announces his resignation and assignment of the throne to his eldest son, Taro (in yellow). The youngest male, Saburo (in blue), objects and is banished.As time passes, the king realizes the changing of leadership status has caused a perceived decline in respect from Taro, and small acts of false pride result in his banishment from the castle. The brings rise to evolves into a complicated political struggle from factions previously beaten into submission from the very family now feuding within itself. Suspicions are fueled by the daughter of one of these subservient clans (Kaede,) and she is a strong, wily woman with great ambition and the will to win. Taro and Jiro (in red,) stir a cauldron of debate resulting in Taro's assassination and Kaede's self professed machinations for her own ends only, with no love lost over her dead husband. She seduces Jiro, winner of the brothers' duel. Meanwhile, the old king wanders the outdoors in an up-welling of senility and despair. His face becomes increasingly white and mask-like, as if one of the living dead. His wandering fool companion (a hall mark of Shakespearean tragedy,) watches him pick flowers aimlessly and declares ""only the mad are sane."" Like Saburo, the fool, Kyomani, lives in the same paradox of wandering homeless as a price for telling the truth.More of the ranks who fell to the Ichimonji clan are revealed: Suei and Tsurumaru, two siblings defeated by the old king. One was subjected to marriage to a royal son, and the other was blinded as a price for sparing his life. Now the old king's exploits are beginning to glow in stark relief. Now the old patriarch of peace is seen from the other side. Old Ichimonji and the fool seek refuge in Tsurumaru the blind's house. The young man has nothing of substance to offer except to play a song on the flute after he declares ""Hospitality of the heart is the only pleasure I have left."" Even in total impoverishment, happiness is a possibility. Jiro is cajoled and prompted by Kaede to carry out her designs. She even over powers him physically to gain his compliance and to seduce him. The one who assassinated his oldest brother is spineless with this woman; this woman who tears apart the whole cabinet of trusted officials and has them all extradited.Out in the wilds, the old King ""shelters in the ruins of the castles he burned,"" as Kyomani the fool states. Manjo, a former cabinet adviser, finds the pair and persuades Kyomani that Saburo must re-connect with his father. Meanwhile, Jiro dies under Saburo's sword and outside forces seek to encroach upon castle three, Saburo's former domain. Saburo's men prevail, and Saburo finds his father in the woods, demented and run down, and tries to reconcile. They do, but the son is immediately killed by a bullet and never knows the spoils of his army's victory on castle three. The summation of the plot: the old king asks ""are there no gods?"" and Kyomani replies ""The gods weep...it is we who can't save ourselves."" This hails back to the question in Rashoman.Kaede is killed by Jiro's former adviser, the king is buried, and I won't spoil the end for you.It is King Lear, The God Father, Death of a Salesman, and The Brothers Karamazov.

Never sure whether to like or hate anyone, want to feel sorry for Lord Hidetora but never quite can, but eventually do, because he's a human being. Both battle scenes are breathtaking, in completely different ways.  The first was so sorrowful and awful and the second just unfathomable, just not possible, there there in front of you,  and in the end, both are equally pointless, needless, horrible in their destruction, yet sorrowfully just. It's amazing that a film that runs for 160 minutes and is only happy for the first five can have the bottom fall out of it so heart-wrenchingly at the end.  That after so much time wandering through such an unhappy world can take what little hope, what little joy, may be left, and snatch it away so breathlessly and finally.   To be a part of this world so long and to be left so empty is just an astonishing thing to me. I recommend making it a two-night event, and having something dutiful to do with your hands while you watch, especially the second night.

Two of the best acting performances I've seen are Tatsuya Nakadai as Lord Hidetora and Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede. I've never seen these actors before (I'm not too familiar with Japanese films), but they are evidently very skilled. The other thing that really stands out is the visual experience. Stunning at least. For example, the battle scenes are beautiful--if battle scenes can be called beautiful--and yet quite realistic.I personally like this movie more than Shichinin no Samurai: but that's something that changes every week.

194,golfer06,A Work of Art,9,15 December 2007,"""Ran"" directed by Akira Kurosawa is truly a masterpiece in film. The essence of camera movement and capturing nature makes it one of a kind. Adapted from William Shakespeare, King Lear, the story centers around three sons, whose father decides to hand down his power and kingdom to one of his sons. After this moment, the sons are truly separated from each other by their need for hubris. Kurosawa does a excellent job with the long shot and capturing the beauty of the scene and the moment. Nature, is also another character in the film, that Kurosawa captures beautifully. At times of chaos it seems that nature responds to reveal a religious entity. By having instances of meaningful emptiness, it allows the audience to have a moments of reflection, which many other films do not offer. Also the pristine use of color in the movie really makes it a wonderful piece of art. Each brother in the movie contains their own color and when these colors clash, it reveals the essence of art. For instance, when the red and yellow sides clash, they cause an orange fire that is set in the castle, to reveal what happens when two sides merge. It may cause destruction and utter chaos. Also the music in the film really makes the film more captivating and worth watching. I highly recommend this film for its use of color, nature, and incredible camera movement.",Ran

Then he gave them each three arrows as a bundle, which they were unable to break. The message is clear: divided they will fall, but united they will stand.In Kurosawa's reimagination, this succession plan takes a dark turn, borrowing from Shakespeare's King Lear. The third son uses his knee to snap the bundle of three arrows, exposing the wishful thinking of his father's lesson. What ensues is an epic film of human ambition, cruelty, and suffering.The cinematography switches between sweeping vistas of grasslands, to the inner chamber of castles, to pitched battles. The samurai dress and armor are majestic in vivid reds, yellows, and blue. An epic film worthy of three legends, Motonari, Shakespeare, and Kurosawa.",Ran

After the Portugese introduced guns intoJapan sometime after 1544, it obviously changed the face of battlefrom bow and arrow emphasis, to a gun emphasis.  The feudalkingdoms that made the transition were the winners and the onesthat didn't were left behind.  So Kurosawa overlays that historicalfact with his own version of King Lear.Great stuff all the way around.",Ran
198,sstransam209,vengeance of a woman,8,9 June 2008,"I think it is so interesting how throughout this whole movie people thought there were making their own decisions, when in actuality they were being manipulated. The father was manipulated and betrayed by his own men, or should I say man; when his adviser told him to go to one of the castles, but when he got to the castle there was a trap and there was a battle, or more like a slaughter. The outcome of that was the father loosing his whole following of men and soldiers. While the other brother and the king of that particular castle got killed. which only left two brothers, but by the end of the movie there was only one of the brothers left, who was going to die anyway. And by far the best manipulator was the older brothers new wife, who was fueling his lust for more power, with her lust for revenge.",Ran

The colors, the composition, the imagery, the symbolism and the movement are all choreographed to touch our hearts, minds and imaginations. And they all come together this way because of director, Kurosawa.This is one of the most breathtakingly visual films that I have ever seen. I'm not sure TV sets ill do it justice, with all of the color and contrast controls.The movie deals with classic plot devices like greed, power, loyalty and love. To be sure, it was adapted (so I've read) from William Shakespeare's KING LEAR. If so, then it was a brilliant adaptation, because, even just visually, the story works.I would highly recommend this movie.",Ran

Location, camerawork, costumes, plot twists, character development, beginning, ending, wars, executions, there is simply no flaw to be found.Was expecting an uninteresting plot, which is usually the case with samurai films from the 80's (Shogun Assassin, Legend of Eight Samura).

Seven Samurai captured the audience a lot better with the linking to characters and the overall 'personal' plot. This movie considering it was made around 30 years later has a lot to answer for in terms of general acting and effects. Das Boot is older for example and is streets ahead in terms of cinematography and audience enthralment.Seven out of ten. Max.",Ran
202,niggbrotha,overrated,4,29 October 2005,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago and, despite its credits given by critics, I must admit not liking it at all. The script is indeed potent, but the way it's materialized fails much behind the director's goals. First of all, this had to be a dramatic movie, while it's actually not. Drama is realized through superficial means and honestly convinces no one. It rather depends on costumes, declamations, stereotypic behavior and forces of nature to achieve something which had to be achieved through EXPRESSIVE ACTING alone. The story drags and the empty space is filled by artsy artifice. All characters are one dimensional and badly acted. Some may argue overacting is a respectable Japanese fashion, but I still don't like it, because it forbids someone to immerse into the plot. The only interesting (and realistic) character is Lady Kaede, also the only one enjoying a respectable performance.The first battle scene is outright ridiculous. Blood has orange colors (!), dead heroes stack one against another in a ""dramatic"" mass of arrows and bullets. Everyone dies except, of course, our main character, bound to have a more dignifying fate and miraculously surviving masses of stray bullets. If the movie ended there, having the main character avoid capture by committing seppuku, or even fearing taking his own life and letting bullets do the work, I would have found the movie enjoyable. But the movie goes on much more into a totally contrived and predictable direction. The end was exactly as I had expected.",Ran
203,johnandrewberardo,The Brilliance of Colors,10,14 December 2007,"Ran is one of the best pieces of Japanese cinema. As an adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear, it truly fascinated me. Akita Kurosawa directs Ran with the brilliance of modern realism and Japanese theatre with the additions of an epic story. It begins with a king separating his kingdom between his three sons. Two of them accept his offer, whereas one declines, insulting his powerful father and being banished from the kingdom. One could already guess the events that unfold after are not good. The first two sons both struggle with the responsibility of power, as the old king struggles with the lack of it.Ran truly exploits the tyranny of power and the lust and greed for it. As a great war epic, it embodies the longer takes as moments of reflection that are very much needed for the deeper drama of the story. The deep focus is something that is taken advantage of in every shot. Kurosawa models the downfall of a ruthless king and his only talent of killing and greed. The one thing that I truly admired about this film was the vibrant colors. Kurosawa is very expressionistic with the color in the film. Each son has a particular color to represent as their own. Also, the use of white on characters expresses evil, which is something that is usually expressed as the opposite. The red vibrance of the blood in the battle scenes is something to admire. Growing up watching war films like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart, color isn't something you see a lot of. I really admired that polar opposite that I witnessed in this film.The last thing I'm going to touch is Kurosawa's use of nature as a whole character. Each scene appreciates nature which is something that is deeply integrated into the Japanese culture. I loved Ran and hope to achieve it's success as a filmmaker myself.",Ran
204,theveneficus,Absolutely brilliant on every level!,10,6 April 2016,"The German artist Caspar David Friedrich once said that ""The painter should paint not only what he has in front of him, but also what he sees inside himself."" That is exactly what Director Akira Kurosawa has done with Ran. The story of a 70 year old warlord in feudal Japan who hastily decided's to split his thrown into three and leave it to his sons. Kurosawa was 76 when he directed this film, and shares many similarities with the central character Hidetora. The eldest Taro receives the first castle and becomes leader of the Ichimonji clan. The other sons Jiro, and Saburo are given castle's two and three. As I'm sure you can imagine things start to rapidly go downhill as Taro and Jiro's motives are soon shown crystal clear. Their greed is ultimately what led to chaos sinking its blooded teeth into the land. And soon Saburo who is cast out by his father raises an army in the hopes of securing peace across Japan. One excellent thing I noticed in this film is the subtle foreshadowing implemented into many scenes. There's an early scene where Saburo (who I initially thought would be the bad egg) insults two of Hidetora's subjects. After he's embarrassed his family the brothers get up and leave, but not before Saburo cuts down some bushes and uses them as shade for his sleeping father. That tiny detail cements his love and respect for Hidetora. The central theme to this film is 'chaos'. The word Ran even means chaos. And there's lots of intelligent scenes which foreshadow the oncoming mayhem. Such as short cuts of clouds ever growing larger until they've become uncontrollable storms. I really cannot say enough good things about this film. But this review has stretched on, so I'll leave it with this. Ran, is without a doubt the best Shakespeare adaptation ever put to screen, and in my personal opinion the greatest Kurosawa film there is.",Ran

With beauty and delicacy, he paints the screen with a cold emptiness, as only a master director could.  Life is absurd and cruel in this epic, but among the deceitful people who betray and kill even their family, there exists some who care.  The movie is dark, and seems to be without hope, but it is not Kurosawa with a doomsday message.  There is no message, nor an attempt to disillusion.  It is a movie that makes the viewer think and reflect, and consider who we are and how we act, and why we live. Supporting the content is the visual orgasm of colors, composition, and motion.  There are few movies that attempt to stretch the limits of film and human creativity, but Ran breaks past those barriers.  Such are the creations of not men, but truly elevated artists.

I was only able to watch it on video and I'm longing to see it on the big screen to fully appreciate Akira Kurosawa's ultimate statement about war. It's not only the masterly directed battle-scenes (which are among the best of all time, that is for sure) that make this film one the best war-epics, along with ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""All quiet on the western front"". It is Kurosawa's whole treatment of this complex adaption of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"": He reflects on the reasons of war, how longtime allies become enemies, how the victims split up in those who forgive and those who revenge and about the innocent, who pay in a war the highest price of all. All these elements are carefully developed and Kurosawa takes a lot of time to unfold his story. And to all, who think this movie needs to much time until something interesting happens: stay at least until the first battle. You'll see, everything that seemed boring or not interesting will work out perfectly and add up to one of the greatest movies of all time.",Ran

I think it takes a level of maturity that is a small minority in the American audience. For though who do connect with it, even with only parts of it, it is a memorable jewel, and like real jewels, rare, precious and enjoyed most by a discerning viewer. It is one of the films that has made my life richer. Richer in the same sense as having a day in front of an original work by VanGogh or watching Eve Ensler herself doing ""The Vagina Monologues.""

The obvious King Lear plot leaves little to guess how this will turn out and the much vaunted battle scenes were rather clumsy. Compared to Kurosawa's early work in Seven Samurai with the wonderful characters or the stunning photography in one of my favorite films, Kagemusha, this film is just dull. It misses completely on the tragedy side since the characters are never really developed and much of the film looks like it was shot in a bowl of a volcano with dirt and dust everywhere. The comic relief of Kyoami, the jester/fool, is just whiny and annoying. When the great lord finally reaches the end of his wits his deep comments on life just seem silly. He is too stilted too play the ""mad"" role properly and all the long shots and very heavy make up leave little opportunity for facial expression.

214,oakbymaple,"Maybe a masterpiece, but only to Connoisseurs",6,26 July 2020,"The Movie certainly has its qualities: carefully built characters, impressive costumes and scenery and an apparent skill in storytelling, at least in some places: the bigger hollywood productions of these days could probably learn tons here.That being said I don't think it's a great movie. It's hard to follow at some points, especially at the battle scene and in its more experimental sequences. Here, heavy with meaning symbols are extensively presented, which not only makes the plot appear very drawn out but also hard to grasp: they are so abstract at times that picking up on them is rather unlikely, unless you have a profound literary background knowledge and a trained eye of course.
The strong influence of classical theatre is also only a plus for the more educated: for instance characters proclaiming their thoughts and feelings is a necissity on stage, but in film this feels kind of out of place. The same goes for the demonstrative use of the names of the scene of events: it's obviously a legitimate means of conveying critical information and also meaning in a script of a play, but film offers so many more and much more effective options than that.
Also: Why is ""going insane"" such a must-have plot item in a classical drama?All in all it's a movie that definitely will have its place in the collections of enthusiasts, but to everyone else it might just be too tough to chew. If you're not into Shakespeare or theatre in general, this movie probably isn't too enjoyable for you.",Ran

This is not the first film by Kurosawa that has a Shakespeare play as inspiration, but I think this is the best one of them all.

The scenography is stunning, the long teleshots reveal the cruelty of war better than any documentary film, and the music nails you to your seat with its bitterness and sadness. Kurosawa must have studied, as I see it, the Italian painter Ucello of the 15th century, to be able to create the battlescenes this original in film history.

For example, it shows the old Japanese theater style where everything is formal called, Noh/Kabuki.It's an appealing looking picture.

The expression of the blood was very interesting; it seemed very fake (compared to the movies nowadays), but it still had a great effect to the audience with the bright red color. He also used the color to almost distinguish the sons in the movies; yellow, red, and blue. While watching, I thought Kurosawa expressed himself in couple different characters; one would be Hidetora, who is so majestic in the beginning in the movie but eventually referred as an old senile fool who can't even take care of himself. It seems as though he represented his career throughout the years, and how he must have felt throughout the years. Especially, when he expressed how pathetic Heditora felt when he couldn't even kill himself; just as how he tried to commit suicide but he fails.

However because of the culture, he took the daughters and make them marry this sons. Although one of the evil son's wife is the darkest, cruelest, most demented female character ever shown on film. However some would disagree calling her a hero and that's why Kurosawa is so brilliant in this movie. Filled with unmatchable imagery of passion and beauty. this film is a most see.

Greed and power consume many of the characters including two of his children. The Great Warlord in his attempt to step down, attempted to give his power to his eldest son and live out the rest of his life with his children. His youngest son Sabaro didn't agree with this and didn't trust his brothers ability to be loyal. The Warlord picks the children who are more willing to show there affection and his downfall starts there.Although slow and drawn out in many scenes Kurosawa does an amazing job showing the size of the battles. The choice to have no music during the Castle raid brought me closer to the battle. Hidetora losing his mind in the tower, and being subject to the barrage of arrows and bullets was one of the most captivating scenes i've ever watched. My favorite character Hidetora's nurse, constantly told the truth. Despite the circumstances he continued to express his feelings and not only added humor when needed, but also only spoke the truth about what was happening in the movie.

Jiro (red) is the scheming son, always looking for a way to gain power and an excuse for bloodshed. Saburo (blue) is the sincere son, caring deeply for his father and the only son of his that is pure. And then there is the Great Lord himself, Lord Hidetora (white). When all colors are combined, white is produced. Hidetora is the combination of his sons. He was ruthless like Jiro, burning peoples homes and slaughtering those who stood before him. He was cowardly like Taro, afraid to lose face in front of the other warlords, so much as to banish his son Saburo for speaking up against him while two other warlords were present.

About a father who wants to pass his power to his three sons. The eldest son gets the most and the youngest son who do not butter up his father so he was banished from the land.The long take and fast cut are the two different major technique Kurosawa used to shoot this film.

It was beautiful to see the bright colors and the beautiful scenery of the grasslands and green hills. Also enjoyed how the director foreshadows upcoming events, such as the scene of the sky with the moving clouds. Another great scene that was tragic but somewhat comical is when Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis tries to kill himself during the castle attack scene and ever attempt goes unaccomplished. He sees a sword, picks it up, and to his surprise it doesn't have a blade. Another scene is when numerous arrows are being shot into the castle, and every single on of them misses Lord Hidetora Ichimonjiis.

The running time is really long: 2 hour 40 minutes, however, I am always mesmerized by the film and forget such long running time. Tatsuya Nakadai's strong presence as the protagonist, sharp eyes like a beast, and his act which follow to Kabuki draw my attention; moreover, the scenes of Japanese Samurais' wars are represented courageously and beautifully by the Kurosawa's grand directions. Furthermore, it is possible to say that Kurosawa represents his ideas about god and death. Especially, at the last scene, a Buddha picture falls off instead of Tsurumaru. I think that Kurosawa represents the same thing with what Tango says; Tsurumaru can ""choose"" his way, alive or death, after the scene, and the picture of Buddha does nothing to him and just fall down from the top of the wall. That is to say, it is possible to argue that Tsurumaru is the metaphor of people who could choose disturbance or peace, and the Buddha represents the useless gods that cannot save people as Tango says. By the way, as a Japanese speaker, I am disappointed at the English subtitle a little bit because it breaks the presence of the Kurosawa's script which expressed in Japanese sometimes. For example, ""Old age is difficult (Aware, oitari)"" Surely, the meaning of this line is correct and exactly; however, I think the English subtitle does not have the power of the words which represented in Japanese.",Ran

Only the third one, Saburo, is trying to help them. However, he got killed. It seemed like in that age, more power means win. However, in the last scene, the Taro lost the war.

Especially, I was moved by Tatsuya Nakadai, who played Hidetora, and Mieko Harada, who played Kaede. Mr. Nakadai could express both mental agony and madness of his role. In addition, Ms.Harada's act was very terrible in the scene that Kaede frightened Jiro after Taro was killed. Finally, the film sets were excellent such as many kinds of weapons and castles.

Although I had never seen anything of this sort, it is important to say that what caught my attention right away was the colorful taste of the scenes. The bloodshed went along with the color for it increase the dramatic take of a scene. This also helped the foreshadowing such as clouds and rain present at various parts of the film to imply the coming of a battle or a big event. Betrayal and the pursuit of power are the main recurring ideas. The battles between brothers for the place of the old father built into a non-ending killing of each other. The role of each actor is very unique, not only because each of them has a determinant role but because they do it very well. Even when the film is based on King Lear, it does take a life of it's own making it more unique.",Ran
233,Elendil87,The Greatest Shakespeare Film,10,31 March 2004,"Throughout his career Kurosawa strove to achieve what he called ""real cinema"", proclaiming that ""in all [his] films, there's [only] three or four minutes"" of such quality. Many would argue that he was his greatest critic. For if not in ""Seven Samurai"", then definitely in ""Ikiru"" and if not in ""High and Low"", then definitely in ""Rashomon"" he must have achieved this plateau of greatness. Well, if not in any of his other films, then definitely in ""Ran"" Kurosawa finally came to the apex of cinematic artistry. With the both lyrical and grandiose tone of its craft, its beautifully spare imagery, its haunting score by Toru Takemitsu, and its lead Tatsuya Nakadai's masterful understated performance, ""Ran"" is perhaps the most fully realized epic ever made.The tale, which is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"", begins as Lord Hidetora Ichimonji and his court are out hunting. During a break in the hunt, Hidetora proclaims his adbication from the hight seat of the Great Lord and bestows his lands unto his three sons, dividing them up equally. He declares his oldest to be his successor in power. When his youngest son and one of his faithful nobles, express their concerns on this idea, Hidetora foolishly banishes them both, mistaking their advice as insolence. With this opening scene, the peaces are aligned and soon 'chaos' as the film is aptly named will break out throughout the land. From here, we see the downfall of Hidetora and all those who surround him. The film retains all the themes of the original play, but also thanks to Kurosawa's own input addresses a slew of even more varied ideas. Like Shakespeare, Kurosawa is greatly interested in the responsibility of the leader and the hypocrisies and ironies of an autocratic system. The most obvious though not the central theme in the whole film is war, and Kurosawa explores this theme to its full extent throughout the film. In perhaps the most grandiose battle scene every filmed, he demonstrates the destructive consequences and the paradoxical beauty of conflict.Here, Kurosawa implements the camera with masterful skill not once employing the editing/photography tricks and gimmicks so often seen in films (even the good ones) today. This director has an awareness of the past and the history of film, but also the creative spontaneity of a true genius. In ""Ran"", he focuses on the more methodically simple yet artistically complex montage of Eisenstein, and on the strict compositions of Ozu. He employs the most basic and yet most artistic of techniques. Each shot is planned to precision, and each cut is made for a purpose. The coreagraphy and blocking of each scene is simple and powerful, and Kurosawa allows the actors to play out these scenes without the intrusion of the camera or the editor. Thus, the director prevents the style from eclipsing the already powerful material he has to work with. Simply put, ""Ran"" is a masterpiece that flows and develops like an opera, from its forebodingly peaceful ouverture to its bloody Shakespearean heart until its final, quietly subdued, and sorrowful denouement.",Ran
234,jplong39,More than meets the eye,10,18 September 2003,"When i first saw this film several years ago, I thought it was long and demanding, and a film to be appreciated but not loved. After several dozen more viewings along with more experience in Japanese cinema (reading of, viewing and commentaries), this has become my favorite film of all time.Understanding the presentation is crucial to admiring this work: how Kurosawa used elements of Shakespearian drama, Japanese History and the ancient Noh theater style to form a coherent surreal experience. Kurosawa also felt that silent films had a visual quality that had been neglected with the advent of sound, so he even throws in the element of that in the films most famous scene!What I originally thought of as bad makeup was not what it seemed at all. Kurosawa based the characters appearences on the masks used in the Noh tradition. Hidetora in the beginning is styled after an evil spirit, but after insanity has set in, the styles takes the form of a tormented soul condemned to wander the earth eternally.The acting various from stage theatricality to subtle but intense minimalism. Tatsuya Nakadai gives an over the top theatrical Shakespearian performance, while at the other end of the spectrum is pure Noh by Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, devestating evil with the baresting amount of physical movement or facial expression. While the burning of the third castle is spectacular, the quiet moments are just as gripping. My personal favorites are the scenes with Kaede, Jiro and a brilliant Hisashi Igawa as Kurogane.True, ""Ran"" may not be for everyone, but for those with an open mind and a bit of patience, whole worlds of meaning and rivetting drama will unfold before you.",Ran

236,sergimb,The most terrible image ever imagined,10,6 August 2003,"****ATTENTION: SPOILERS*****A rendition of Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran is an extremely imaginative and well-crafted adaptation and an impressive cinematographic experience.Regarding the plot, Ran it's pretty similar to Lear although it's even more morally ambiguous than it's original source as Lord Ichimonji's 'good' son is neither so sweet nor so loyal as Shakespeare's Cordelia. In his way he is as brutal as his brothers although he is respectful and sincere to his father. The progression follows a terrible logic: greed leads to violence which leads to greater violence until it destroys everyone (all the main characters and most of the rest).Regarding the technical aspects, the film is just GORGEOUS to watch: the cinematography, dresses, sets, locations... everything is astounding. And the music by great master Toru Takemitsu, though for the most part it's just unearthly noises made by woodwinds, strings and percussion, gets a deep, restrained, Mahlerian poignancy during the attack on the castle (compare it to Mahler's The Song of the Earth, final movement).(**Attention: BIG spoiler**) But the very best part of the film is also its very worst: the ending, with the poor blind guy abandoned (her sister just been killed) on the edge of an immense cliff, surrounded by emptiness and with just his stick between him and the most probable death... it's just more than I can stand.

I would definitely describe this as an epic. The characters are so well developed and I care about them all, including the minor ones.One thing I found interesting was how the minor characters supported the plot and ideas presented. I don't think I have ever seen this done to the same extent as in this movie.****Possible Plot Spoilers****The plot in this movie flows very well. It starts off with a calm setting and premise. Then things quickly take a change for the worse after Lord Hidetora relinquishes his power over the lands to his three sons.The dark side of human nature, as well as the good side are presented in such a compelling way that it just draws you in and never lets you go. The major characters have interesting twists to their personalities and behaviors. I was definitely caught off guard by this at first. But the twists make sense as the movie progresses. You start to realize that they are very human in that greed and power takes over their once rational, caring selves. Not every character is like that, just like in real life and that is what makes the character/plot development outstanding.The one thing that sticks out as a negative in this movie were some of the battle scenes. However these weak moments were so brief and quickly give way to excellent scenes of battle.****End Possible Plot Spoilers****If you are into an epic movie, with beautiful scenery & costumes, an intriguing plot and unforgettable characters, you must see this movie!",Ran

So when I found out that Ran was based off of Shakespeare's King Lear I was already having concerns, even though I had never read King Lear in depth . However, all concerns vanished once the film started.All at once a tale about devotion, betrayal, war and most of all, family, Kurosawa's take on the story is epic yet intimate, all at once an outlook on three warring nations as well a look at the nature of sibling hood and fatherhood, of families broken, and of vengeance. Fantastic performances by the actors (including a deceptively incendiary performance by Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede) only add more to the film.From the opening credits to the tragic finale (after all, this is a tragedy), the film is captivating.

Is it for the high expectations built up in this period, or the ageing of this film, but I found Ran a rather disappointing viewing experience.The story of course is known, but the elaboration on the screen lacks some consistency in my mind. It's too long (the wandering scenes with the ""fool"" Hidetora accompanied by his jester could have been much shorter without missing anything essential) and in general it remained too superficial. The leading parts don't get any development of character (only exception: lady Kaede), although you could have been expecting this with such a tragic story as King Lear on the background.Although the mass fighting scenes, seen in the light of today's CGI, are not spectacular any more, they're very good done. The acting performances are fine too, topping Mieko Harada as lady Kaede, an intrigante who wants to take revenge on the Hidetora family. She gets some marvelous scenes and manages them very well.

'Every frame a painting' is thrown around a lot. But if I had to pick one film to describe the above expression, it would be Ran.
This is a film with perfect cinematography, acting, and characters. The battle sequences are jaw-dropping. The colours that are presented in the screen is vibrant. And I have never been more interested in a film's story.
The story is adapted from Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. This is the best Shakespearean story adapted to the screen.
The characters are complex and their motivations are deep. The story is also sad. I got easily lost in this world and when I saw certain character arcs, I was in near tears.
This movie is worth watching just for its costume and set design (which it won an Academy Award for). Kurosawa uses the vast plains to his advantage in the framing of the landscape. You can admire something in every shot.
Characters act in a very human way. You can easily put yourself in his/her's position and feel their decision justified. This film is underrated in the sense of a human story. This movie is an epic of gargantuan proportions.
It's amazing to think now that Kurosawa couldn't get funding for this movie. He spent 5 years storyboarding every frame and the end result was a masterpiece. Ran stands alongside Seven Samurai as Kurosawa's best. And Ran is easily one of my favourite films of all time.",Ran

It's kind of Japanese version of ""King Lear."" Even though it is based on ""King Lear"" story, this movie approaches me very Japanese style. What I mean is, it follows buddism and rewards in accordance with deeds in our life by showing chaotic battles and betrayal.By watching this movie, it reminds me 'What comes around, what goes around.' Once you betray someone, you would be betrayed. In this movie battle scenes are splendid. I think Kurosawa shooted very unique way that shows well by using wide camera angle that capture both armies. In this movie, Hidetora's make up is too much overdone and I guess it's because influence of Japanese traditional play called ""Kabuki"" Development of movie takes long time form scene to the other scene, so it can be a little bit bored to watch but it's interesting to see how it does reflect our life.",Ran
252,nicholas-murillo,Just another comment,10,9 June 2008,"I felt that Ran was an amazing film. It was a little slow at the beginning of the film but then it really picked up. I think that the most amazing scene was when the son first attacked the father. The Father was sitting up in his room and he was trying to die but could not get hit by an arrow. Even though they were flying everywhere around him, and they were on fire. And then he tried to commit suicide but he could not find a sword that wasn't broken. And to have all of the men with dozens of arrows stuck in them was very gruesome. I thought this was awesome and really set the standard for future war directors. I also thought that the women in this women are portrayed with lots of power and almost superior to the men. I think that this was really amazing because you don't often see this happening in film.

It really feels like a stage play on film, with lots of overacting and melodrama.The lead character of Hideotora goes mad about halfway through the film and then there are endless scenes of him being wide-eyed and crazy, and it gets old fast.The battle scenes are a huge swing and a miss, endless shots of horses and men running around aimlessly, followed by endless shots of them getting mowed down by gunfire. It gets old fast. And the rate of fire of those guns simply is not accurate to the times.In short, if you want to get into Kurosawa, watch his black and white classics, Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood...not this, which, IMO, is a sad endnote to a great director's career.",Ran
255,wallesque,Excellent,9,6 February 2005,"This movie is a masterpiece, and that it was made by Kurosawa at such a late point in his life is truly amazing.As has been previously noted, this movie is a rough adaptation of a play by Shakespeare (though not 'Macbeth,' as the previous review indicated, but 'King Lear'). However, the setting has been transferred to feudal Japan, and the themes updated somewhat by Kurosawa. The result is a reinterpretation that needs no understanding of the original play, and is on its own one of the great artistic masterpieces of film in the 1980's.The image from this movie that stays with most people, I think, is a clear comment of the world surrounding Kurosawa in the decade of Star Wars (the Reagan program) and the invasion of Afghanistan (by the USSR). The most lasting image of this movie points to a world on the brink of apocalypse, and Kurosawa uses his cinematic techniques to bring a story of feudal Japan into the modern world, and it contains messages still relevant in our current time (with the revival of Star Wars and the new invasion of Afghanistan - among other countries - it is clear that we are not too far from the world of the 80's).This movie can convey an artistic point that is still relevant through it's oblique interaction with the modern world, and aside from that, it is a great work of art.",Ran
256,SacredTeabag,Very disappointing considering the enormous potential,5,14 August 2005,"There are many longer reviews written about Kurosawa's ""Ran"", so I will keep it short and only outline why I think the film is hugely overrated and very disappointing. The film has great potential. Visually it is very impressive (in spite of a few disruptive cuts in the cavalry scenes), and the music and sound support the images extremely well. Very deservedly it was awarded the Oscar for best Costumes. But in the domain of storytelling I found ""Ran"" lacking. It positively reminds of Classical and Shakespearian tragedies and aspires to tell a great tale of the demise of an empire and family dynasty built on bloodshed, but the characters and their motivations are sadly unconvincing. Kurosawa spends much of the three hours on lavish images, yet he does not really develop what lies beyond the surface. The Great Lord and his three sons remain character sketches, and so the old Lord's emotional ups and downs and his sons' violent struggle over his succession seem jumpy and unconvincing without a deeper development of their motivations and family story. The only exception to this is the scheming wife of the Great Lord's oldest son.Granted, I don't understand Japanese and so have to rely on the subtitles. Furthermore, a Japanese viewer may probably read far more in the faces, gestures and intonation than someone only quaintly accustomed with Japanese culture. Nevertheless, this is no excuse. The movie simply does not achieve what it aims for. Apart from the visual pleasures the result is fairly shallow, too slow and overlong (although I generally prefer longer films). To me ""Ran"" is completely over-hyped. If you want tragedy, there are plenty of decent Shakespeare adaptations on film. If you want great storytelling and characters watch movies like those of the Cohen brothers (e.g. ""Millers Crossing"" or ""Barton Fink""). And if you are after the great images and the Asian flair watch one of the three recent Chinese Martial Arts epics. (Out of which ""Hero"" is probably the most interesting with the moral and political questions it provokes.) It pains me to say this, but in my view Kurosawa's ""Ran"" is simply not worth watching - at least not for entertainment.",Ran

261,swordofsutekh,An excellent adaptation of King Lear with its own character.,10,16 November 2006,"As arrows and bullets sail through the air, the white clouds in the sky give way to an approaching storm of despair. The mistakes of a father have come to torment him, and while it is arguable rather or not he should be considered a hero, it is unquestionable that his life has become a tragedy worthy of our pity.Akira Kurosawa's Ran is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's King Lear. It is the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, who has decided in his elder years, to relinquish leadership of his clan to one of his three sons. As King Lear did before him, he judges his sons too quickly, and makes the first wrong decision amongst many, each costing him more dearly than the last.Hidetora is a memorable character, not only on account of his torment, but also through his portrayal by actor Tatsuya Nakadai. The movie has subtitles, but they are unneeded in understanding the emotions of the character, as they are displayed with such strength they shatter the language barrier. When Hidetora feels something, it is often difficult to find yourself not feeling the same.In fact, it would be difficult to look down upon the performances of any of the actors in the movie. Every character, from the three sons to the various servants, is shown in such a manner that you learn to love or hate them. If a character is shown on the screen for even a few minutes, it is unlikely you will be left with a neutral opinion of them.It is simple to see the planning placed into this film, as every element is handled exceptionally well. The costumes and musical score are elaborate and fit well into the frame of this epic movie. The humor is limited, as it should be, and is incorporated at the right times, serving to make the movie all the more enjoyable. Akira Kurosawa's artistic direction makes even the clouds an important element of the film. They not only serve to show the passage of time, but also reflect the mood of the scenes.This movie might not be for everyone. It does show some age, not every scene is packed with action or comedy, and it does require the reading of subtitles. Nonetheless, if you are a fan of Japanese cinema, or even if you are not, you owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance.Highly recommended. A solid ten out of ten.",Ran

264,O_L_D_B_O_Y,RAN - A Classic Of Its Time And For All Time,10,30 December 2004,"Based on Shakespeare's King Lear, this film follows the story of the aging warlord Hidetora who, in an attempt to restore peace, divides his kingdom between his three sons - Taro, Jiro, and Saburo - and retires from his duties. However, one of his sons sees this as unwise and is banished by his father, leaving his two brothers in charge of two of the three castles left in their hands. It isn't long before they are overtaken by greed and eventually betray their father, leaving him in the hands of a philosophical jester and a loyal retainer. This betrayal ultimately leads to war, dividing the family and driving Hidetora insane.The remarkable script, which contains many of my favorite lines from any film, still manages to break its way through the confinement of subtitles and reveals itself to be one of the richest Kurosawa ever wrote. He has obviously worked equally hard on the look and feel of the film - the cinematography being excellent (example: the long, continuous shot of Saburo's men charging on horseback across a river).There's also something rather frightening about it that I can't quite put my finger on. The first battle, which is the film's turning point, is the most horrifying, yet strangely beautiful, battles ever filmed. A good effect used is the loss of sound, with only Toru Takemitsu's haunting score to be heard. The entire battle lasts less than ten minutes and there is no uplifting or bombastic music to be heard, but in my opinion, it's Ran's finest scene, and thus the finest scene ever.What Kurosawa managed to get rather than give though was excellent performances from his actors, none more brilliant than Tatsuya Nakadai's Hidetora, Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede (a woman similar to Lady Macbeth but with a different hidden agenda), and the strangely-named Peter as Kyoami.",Ran
265,Kherozen,So good ...,10,23 November 2002,"A masterpiece about the power, the loyalty,the corruption and the end of a empire. Your ally are not always the same when they take the power. Who is corrupted and who not... That the question... This movie  is unique, the story is so good and you can see it many times. The true is RAN is one of the best movie ever made. Maybe it's difficult for everybody to find this masterpiece but it's really a treasure.A 10/10 ( The first and maybe the last that i give)",Ran
266,sanjeevsripathi,I hate it,8,28 January 2011,"With a passion. You know why? It broke my heart. Broke it into a million pieces, over and over and over again.I haven't read King Lear, so I cannot comment on whether this is related to the play or not. It is, however, a tragedy of monumentally saddening proportions.The movie details the turns Hidetora's life takes, after he cedes the throne to his sons and watches them turn his world into ash. The movie details the man's fall, starting out slowly and gathering momentum as it goes along. This movie does not seek to make anyone happy, not its viewers, and certainly not its characters. They are led through war, betrayal, suicide and immense amounts of pain. And they come out broken and tortured.Hidetora is tormented by all the wars he has instigated and all the suffering he has caused. Those who he has burnt in his pursuit of power all bear their scars openly, some through hate and others through sorrow. His sons are constantly plotting against him and each other, driven by greed and women. Their advisors are helpless to watch as their lords fall into ruin, taking them with.And the innocent all fall in the wake of the strong.I will not watch this movie again. Dealing with pain is not my forte.",Ran
267,steklujo,"This is more than a movie, it's a painting!",10,13 September 2002,"This is one of those movies that has put a mark on my eye. A film to be seen on a large screen.The beginning of the film with the big grass hills and it's peace suddenly disturbed by the wild boar hunt is breath taking. The light in this movie is remarkable and makes the movie to look like a big painting. The sound and the ""none sound"" also plays an important part, especially in the battle sceens. The effect with ""none battle"" sounds suddenly interrupted by the shot in the back and then full battle sound is just one example of what makes this film so special. Almost surrealistic in sound and story.It's a realy long movie, I enjoyed every minute first time I saw it and I still do!",Ran
268,wolfrick-d,An interesting take on Shakespeare.,8,24 December 2008,"Director Akira Kurosawa does an interesting take on William Shakespeare's ""King Lear"", shifting the setting into feudal era Japan. The story follows war lord Hidetora who attempts to divide his land up between his three sons Saburo, Taro and Jiro while slowly slipping into insanity. However, Taro's wife attempts to destroy the family in order to take control, resulting in the peaceful countryside descending into bloody chaos. Ran then reveals it's party piece- a visually stunning yet haunting battles between two of the brothers, while Hidetora sinks even further into madness. Through a blend of tragedy, action and suspense, Kurosawa has created a masterpiece which is deservedly a classic epic. Ran will appeal to those fond of the works by Shakespeare or film fanatics in general. Suspense and action make this film an absolute must-see.",Ran
269,theNuttyprofessor,One of the greatest movies ever made.,10,22 January 2011,When I first watched this movie I had never heard anything about it before. What I then watched for the next 2 hours and 45 minutes was the probably best movie I have ever seen. The movie is based on Shakespeare's King Lear and directed by one of the best movie directors ever. The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is almost perfect. The dialogue is written very smart and the whole movie is very wise. Some of the scenes are incredible like for example the epic battle between Jiro and Taro. When Kurosawa made Ran he was almost 75 years old. This was his last big movie and also his most expensive. It is technically perfect and all the battle scenes are brilliant. The costumes are also beautiful and I even think that they won the academy award. After watching the movie I was so impressed that I didn't speak a word for 15 minutes. I can really just suggest this movie and hope that many people enjoy watching this as much as I did.,Ran
270,davidsk,"Shakespeare framework, a master film makers artwork",10,28 October 2003,"I've seen this movie more than 20 times...and it never ceases to please they eye and mind. I've been reading comments here and there that it does not live up to Shakespeares' King Lear, but I'm not sure that was what Kurosawa was attempting to do. The core concepts of the story (a house divided, greed, sibling rivalry, etc.)are so compelling, that when combined with Kurosawas' brilliant framing and extraordinary use of color and form are astounding.One of my top 10 favorite films. Enjoy it!",Ran
271,klopmanneke,Beautiful mix of emotions with a touch of magic.,10,24 March 2005,"This movie is so good I can't believe it. I just saw him and it is truly amazing. Akira Kurosawa really delivered a masterpiece. A land thorn apart when it is divided under 3 brothers, but more important, the family thorn apart as well. I loved this movie, it's been a very very long time that I saw a masterpiece like this. I left a tear at some scenes I admit. The drama is unseen, if you are not touched by this movie I doubt you have any feelings. I love the way the story is told with great acting in beautiful scenes, even in the few action scenes there was so much emotion. The sad sad history of the father having to bear the burden of regret. This one you must definitely see.",Ran
272,sameralnajjar,One of the best Kurosawa movies,9,7 December 2014,"One of the best King Lear adaptation in history of cinema, Akira Kurosawa artistic touch paint each frame with colorful symbolic meaning, as the movie progress you can feel the colors bloody, gloomy and blue representing the story.With the outstanding performance of Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada, Kurosawa master his camera like never before, with no cgi i don't reckon the cinema industry now days can afford this cost anymore unfortunately.This epic movie in my humble opinion is the crown jewel of Kurosawa movies.Ran It is a must-see movie.",Ran
273,r_ives,A slow yet beautiful look at the life of lords and samurai,8,19 March 2021,"This was my first Kurosawa film but certainly will not be my last. The film starts quite slow just building the tension between family members which inevitably ends in chaos. I didn't know what to expect from this film and was a little apprehensive due to the long running time. However not alone did I enjoy this film there are still moments I relive in my mind thinking back on this film, the scenes where troops gather to invade the fort of Lord Ichimonji with beautiful orchestrated music was a stroke of genius from Kurosawa which made the battle seem all that more heartbreaking, I will not say anymore about the film as I can't spoil a truly great film such as this, but on a macabre level I've never seen corpses in a film look so genuine the costume and makeup department did a marvellous job, this film is one to see for a real film enthusiast, the less you know about this film when watching for the first time is essential a true masterpiece of cinema",Ran
274,Yatesy_2003,One of the most moving movies i have ever seen,9,12 February 2005,"Ran was not what I expected, I saw it in my local video shop and thought I would check it out as I have an interest in the time period. When I was finished watching it I was amazed at the genius of Kurosawa. He creates a story wrought with betrayal and honour. And with characters (which I found to be one of the few times I have actually felt for) you either hate or feel sorry for them, like Hidetora's madness induced by his two sons betrayal and how he has made his own destruction. Plus, you actually hate the character of the two older brothers, Taro and Jiro and how they have conspired against Hidetora. But especially Lady Kaede when she died it was one of the best parts of the film as from the start she was a conniving and ruthless character which you felt no love for. The battles were also very good and graphic. In all Ran a movie I thought was just about Samurai, turned out to be the best film or one of I have ever seen 10/10 most definitely",Ran
275,27xllla,One of the best from kurosawa films,9,7 September 2019,"""Ran"" is based on the greatest writer's William Shakespeare's play ""King Lear"". It is one of the best films about Japanesse history, it is a real masterpiece.",Ran
276,raistlin_lukas,Single. Greatest. Shakespeare. Adaptation. Ever.,10,9 July 2005,"Thankee kindly.Kurosawa, while a great director, isn't somebody whose films I blindly endorse.However, Ran takes the cake. It easily makes my personal top five films any time I think about it.The imagery is absolutely stunning, and the dialogue is quite clever. The battle scenes are suitably horrific, and the humor (and yes, there is humor) is subtle enough not to get in the way.All told, one of the greatest films it's been my privilege to see. I watched it to get the nightmare that was Cold Mountain out of my head, as proof that long movies can actually be epic, as opposed to boring, trite, and predictable.",Ran
277,tenjou_tenge,Kurosawa Likes Shakespeare,9,7 August 2005,"The most important thing about this film is that it is Kurosawa's take on Shakespeare's King Lear. That's the meat of it, and if you dig Shakespeare, watch this movie. One of the reasons those of us in the west almost invariably gravitate towards Kurosawa's films when popping our proverbial cherry in Japanese film is because the production value of ALL his films are so high. It is true that you VERY rarely follow actors, and should follow directors instead. Kurosawa obsessively disallows any and all failure or lack of ambition in his films, and this one is no different. His choking grip on the reins of his films may actually have contributed to his fatal stroke, but I'm no doctor. The one reason this film loses a 10/10 is because it is somewhat inaccessible. Whereas Shakespeare's iambic pentameter in many cases makes it difficult for neophytes to understand what is actually going on in the story, Kurosawa similarly steeps RAN so deep into Japanese culture that those who are not familiar with it WILL lose something in the translation. You'll understand what's going down, but there are so many layers that you just might not see because you don't know. My advice: Watch this film. Then, read the original Shakespeare, brush up on a little (it won't take much) on the proper etiquette for the bushi/samurai, doshin/bonge, buke/kuge, and hinen classes/castes, and you'll get a lot more from the experience. While you're at it, read up on the oyabun and kobun etiquette and obligations, Polish it off with a somewhat working knowledge of the system of conflict between Ninjo, Gimu, and Giri, and the film will mean a lot more to you. However, most will be unlikely to do so, so Kurosawa's RAN may be, as stated, inaccessible to many.",Ran
278,cmsg-42995,Disappointing,3,1 February 2021,I had read a greatest War movie list and this topped it. Having read the reviews and seen the Meta Critic score I thought it would be a must see. I was never gripped by it and in the end I only watched it all because I'd started it. Perhaps others will enjoy but it wasn't for me,Ran
279,sylhan,A Masterpiece!!!,10,19 November 2020,"Ran is the story of Lord Hidetora Ichimonji, a man who has won his kingdom through decades of violent and brutal warfare.
There are the similarities between Kurosawa's story and Shakespeare's King Lear.
Kurosawa was able to make the film he had been wanting to for years. Though not his final film, it is certainly his last great masterpiece.",Ran
280,m-90095-45675,Weak Men And A Woman's Scorn,8,26 November 2018,"It takes a lot to destroy or damage a Shakespearean tale and of course Kurosawa would not ever do such a thing. He has the midas touch. His version of a story of betrayal and lust for film is a sight for the eyes, but also deeply critical of the human condition. Kurosawa had to go West for funding, but the result s scary and splendid.",Ran
