0,Leofwine_draca,"All action, no brain; worth the one watch",5,24 November 2016,"I quite enjoyed the first UNDERWORLD movie, so when I saw that this sequel had a stronger rating, I was all for it, hoping for a decent action flick a la BLADE II. On the face of it, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION offers exactly that, a tense thrill ride with plenty of action and heroics throughout. Oddly enough it fails from becoming a classic because it's got simply too much action, and action that's all pretty similar at that. Watching people fight with CGI monsters and heroes getting wounded but always coming back to life gets a bit stale after a while. I was also annoyed with Wiseman's colour palette; here it's all the same bluey-grey tones as we saw in DIE HARD 4.0, and it seems to be the only style of filming that the director uses. Why not branch out for some variety once in a while? Still, on the face of it, I love action and monster bloodshed, and this film delivers that in spades. There's a cool new monster on the scene, a huge and powerful flying vampire guy, who is well animated and frightening, and a briefly-seen ""king"" werewolf, huge and white. The CGI werewolf transformations are well done and have a nice stop-motion look to them that recall the old Universal classics amongst others. There are some decent set-pieces, including a truck chase and a cavernous climax, but it's all a little too silly and repetitive for my liking. Watching Kate Beckinsale pull ammo from behind her back where there clearly was none a moment before is just cheating the audience, and seeing her take down armed policemen in a forest, using her martial arts skills, is a little too been-there-done-that. Wiseman just wants everything to look cool without question, and the result is frequent lapses in logic and more plot holes than I could count.One of the silliest things about the film is the ludicrous back story. It was bad in the first film and even more demented here, with this guy doing something to that guy, that guy's family getting offended and doing something back, two different hybrid folks, blah blah blah. Who cares, really? There's no sense of even the family history that I saw in BLADE II; it just seems preposterous and half-hearted. The acting is also something of a detraction. Principal actors like Beckinsale and Speedman are sleepwalking through this, and I was annoyed when Bill Nighy turned up despite being killed in the first film (he's in a flashback here). Dressed in armour nicked from LORD OF THE RINGS, Nighy hams so bad I nearly turned the film off there and then, definitely the worst he's done. 'Classical' actor Derek Jacobi turns up to grab a pay cheque, and Beckinsale strips off for a silly sex scene which hints but shows nothing. What's the point, really? I have to admit that the special effects throughout are good, even if the situations are ludicrous. The film wins marks for offing one of the bad guys with helicopter blades (always a pleasure to watch and executed perfectly here) but uses the same kind of science-defying mistake we saw in Van Damme's SUDDEN DEATH, when a helicopter drops vertically and somehow its blades don't stop spinning, even after it's crashed. Good gore, bad plot; for what it's worth, I enjoyed this flick, but it's not one I would want to watch again.",Underworld - Evolution
1,SnoopyStyle,confusing story,4,2 August 2014,"For 8 centuries, there has been a secret war between the ruling Vampires and rebellious Lycan. The two immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus are Markus bitten by a bat and William bitten by a wolf. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) had killed Viktor and is going to be hunted for it. She only has hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) to back her who is a direct descendant of Corvinus. She needs to wake last elder Marcus and expose the truth before Kraven has a chance to kill him. Kraven wakes Marcus but he's too powerful for Kraven. Marcus finds out that Selene killed Viktor and goes on the hunt for her.There is way too much backstory and way too much exposition. It drags down the movie before it could get started. The audience needs a scorecard to keep track of all the characters and all doublecrossing. The movie needs a simplified story with a beginning, a middle, and an ending. There is a lot of interesting action but most of it is wasted in this confused mess.",Underworld - Evolution
2,Prismark10,Regression,3,25 July 2015,"The first Underworld film was OK thanks largely to a decent plot and Kate Beckinsale looking hot in a all in one leather outfit which seems to have kick-started a genre of horror staples such as vampires, werewolves, zombies and Frankenstein as superheroes and super villains.The sequel manages to entice Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy briefly and adds Derek Jacobi. I can see the casting agent on this one. Forget the Royal Shakespeare Company guys you need to follow in the footsteps of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and make horror films.In this sequel vampires and werewolves battle for supremacy among the undead. Sultry Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and hybrid Lycan Michael (Scott Speedman) try to untangle the secrets of their past and bloodlines. Jacobi is the father of two sons one who became the original vampire the other who became the original werewolf. The vampire Marcus (Tony Curran) plans to unleash a new force as he hunts down his brother entombed many centuries ago.The plot is confusing and convoluted. The film conveniently gives flashbacks to the original film, useful as I can hardly remember much about it. We have plenty of fight action sequences set in a blue neon tinged nighttime but its badly choreographed with cheapo CGI.The film suffers from horrid plotting and poorly drawn character arcs. A father who could had saved the world from a lot of bother if he forcefully dealt with his deviant sons. Yet one his offspring is happy to see off his dad.This is a letdown from the original film.",Underworld - Evolution
3,claudio_carvalho,The Last Hope Left,8,13 November 2006,"Selene (Kate Beckinsale) wishes to expose the truth about the death of Viktor to the first true vampire Marcus (Tony Curran) that is hibernating. However, Marcus has already awakened and wants to release his savage Lycan brother William (Brian Steele), who has been imprisoned for centuries. When Marcus tries to get the medal possessed by Lucian from the hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman), Selene decides to visit Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), the exiled official historian of the covens, to understand his interest. When Selene and Michael meet Tanis, they disclose the truth about their bloodlines, and later with the support of Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), Selene faces the powerful and evil Marcus as the last hope left for the mankind.It is very difficult to see good sequels, but ""Underworld – Evolution"" gave me the sensation that together with ""Underworld"", they are one good movie split in two parts. The viewers like me that enjoyed ""Underworld"" will certainly like this sequel very much. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Anjos da Noite – A Evolução"" (""Angels of the Night - The Evolution"")Note; On 28 January 2017, I saw this film again.",Underworld - Evolution
4,kosmasp,"Bigger, but also better?",6,3 May 2012,"It's always the same question you'll find yourself asking, when it comes to sequels. You know it's going to be bigger, but does that mean it's going to be better? At least this isn't really bad though. You get the same actors that played their respective roles (and survived) the first Underworld movie. That means you get a very stunning and beautiful Kate Beckinsale again! It's not so much the story that will interest you here though, but the action. And this I can tell you, is well shot. Plus even the small amount of story gets treated in a nice fashion here (the fact it's a real sequel should please you). Of course after this came a prequel, before they continued the story in 2011/2012 (though I'm guessing the forth one might be the last one too).",Underworld - Evolution
5,jboothmillard,Underworld: Evolution,3,22 November 2008,"From director Len Wiseman (Die Hard 4.0), this sequel is not any different in terms of quality, it again just doesn't do very well. You may remember how in the last film, Selene (Van Helsing's Kate Beckinsale) woke up Viktor (Bill Nighy) in hope to help end the war, and he betrayed the vampire side, oh, and also Michael (Scott Speedman) became a vampire/Lycan (werewolf) hybrid, well, the story pretty much continues with those facts in mind. This time Selene is trying to stop the original Lycan, William (Brian Steele), released from centuries of imprisonment, and we learn that years ago, he and his brother Marcus (Tony Curran) began the bloodline of vampires and werewolves, and their immortal father Alexander Corvinus (Derek Jacobi) wants Selene and Michael to put a stop to them and (hopefully) the war. Also starring Michael Sheen (archive footage mainly) as Lucian, Steven Mackintosh as Tanis, Shane Brolly as Kraven and Scott McElroy as Soren. The special effects as with the previous are still not bad, but again don't really add much to the story, which is still pretty unoriginal, the only moment that caught my eye most was Beckinsale's great looking body (covering breasts and bum of course) during a sex scene. Adequate!",Underworld - Evolution
6,Tweekums,A solid follow on from the first film,7,18 July 2016,"This film opens eight hundred years ago as we see an early battle between vampires and lycans; it ends with the capture of William, the first lycan, by his brother, Marcus the first vampire, and Victor. We then return to the present; moments after the previous film ended. Selene is on the run with hybrid Michael but decides she must return to mansion before Kraven and kill Marcus it turns out that by the time she gets there Marcus has killed Kraven. Marcus is determined to find and free his brother William; something that would be disastrous for the world as he and those he turns are unable to take human form so are always vicious creatures. Selene and Michael are determined to stop him.Before watching this film it is highly advisable that you watch opening film first as little time is wasted explaining who is who or what is going on. If you watched and enjoyed the first film you are almost certain to enjoy this as it is at least as good if not slightly better. There is plenty of exciting action throughout the film as well as a fairly solid story. The cast does a fine job; Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene and Scott Speedman impresses as Michael his character is definitely more interesting now he has become the hybrid. Derek Jacobi is a fine addition as Corvinus; the first immortal and father of Marcus and William. On the down side some of the CGI shows its age a bit but thankfully not enough to spoil my enjoyment of the film. The ending nicely wraps up the story before hinting at more to come. Overall I'd say this was a pretty good film that fans of the franchise are sure to enjoy.",Underworld - Evolution
7,ma-cortes,Again the eternal fight between vampires and werewolves in this second entry,7,27 May 2008,"This original and gore-soaked vampires film begins in 1202 a.d., eight centuries ago. Unknown to humanity, a blood feud raged between a ruling class of vampires and rebellious legion of werewolves known as Lycans. Legend tells that the war began with two brothers, the immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus(Tony Curran) bitten by bat became the blood leader of the vampires. William(Brian Steele) , bitten by wolf became the first and most powerful Lycan. For six centuries Selene(Kate Beckinsale) was a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she was betrayed. The war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Kraven, the second-in-command had formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor(Bill Nighy), vampires leader . But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. But Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe. He has betrayed them all. Soon the hunt would be on for his killer. Selene has but one ally left : Michael(Scott Speedman), the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither vampire nor Lycan, but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before they're found. Their only hope now is to awaken to Markus , the last remaining Elder and expose the truth, before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's match for him awake. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael are going to Tanis's(Steven Mackintosh) fortress for getting information. As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty entertaining. Packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with bullets. Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful and dark cinematography by Simon Duggan . Spectacular production design by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of known blockbusters, such as 10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black among them. The motion picture is well directed by Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale's husband . He's also the screenwriter along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. All participate in the following, a prequel in pre-production, titled 'Rise of the Lycans' directed by Patrick Tatopoulos and with similar actors. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.",Underworld - Evolution
8,BA_Harrison,"It doesn't make any sense, but Evolution still entertains.",7,31 January 2009,"Vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and vamp/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run, having just destroyed treacherous elder bloodsucker Viktor. Hot on their heels is recently awakened original vamp Marcus, who wishes to free his long imprisoned lycan brother William, but who must first extract vital information held in Selene's memory in order to do so.For Evolution, the sequel to his 2003 'vampire versus werewolf' hit Underworld, writer/director Len Wiseman once again plays by a set of very indistinct rules, thus allowing himself the flexibility necessary to make his rather flaky script work. By ignoring accepted vampiric and lycanthropic lore, Wiseman may risk upsetting many a die-hard monster fan, butand this is a BIG 'but'he manages to compensate for his contrived, confused, and convoluted script by making the film so damn slick and visually stunning that it's almost impossible not to have fun.An absolute feast for the eyes, Evolution is even better to look at than its predecessor, with mind-boggling special effects, more beautiful cinematography (although use of another colour other than blue would have been nice), and greater attention to detail. The sequel is also sexier than before (there's even a brief scene of rumpy pumpy with Kate and Scott), gorier than before (this time, blood is splashed all over the place), and packed with more outrageous fight action than before. Hell, even Kate Beckinsale's rubber-clad butt looks better than it did in the original Underworld!Evolution is spectacular, big-budget horror for the masses, and as such, it doesn't take too many risks (besides having an unfathomable plot, of course). But as far as mindless, gory, FX-laden popcorn flicks go, you could do a lot worse.",Underworld - Evolution

10,hitchcockthelegend,Oh Brother!,7,21 October 2015,"The sequel to cult fave Underworld (2003) finds vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and half werewolf Michael (Scott Speedman) unravelling the truth about their respective blood lines. Just what caused the feud between the vampires and the lycans?Unsurprisingly reviews for this sequel are mixed, it's either a smart action popcorner that was warranted, or it's a huge let down after the first film. Personally I'm in the first camp, personally because it does pretty much the same things, only the story has a bit of complexity about it to try and bluff us that it's cerebral.For a film about vampires and werewolves at war it delivers all that is required in the modern era. There's lots of high energy action, blood and guts galore, CGI overdrive, fast pacing and a sexy lead actress fronting the piece. The story ticks along nicely, introducing new and interesting characters, while flashbacks fill in the gaps for any newcomers to the series. The main villain is one bad-ass winged mofo, a genuine terror that our protagonists have right to fear, and the finale is as expected a bonkers array of bloody chaos.Smartly put together by director Len Wiseman and coolly photographed by Simon Duggan (steel blues and greys), it isn't ground breaking cinema, but it's a wail of a time for those with expectation levels set at popcorn bonanza. 7/10",Underworld - Evolution
11,Scarecrow-88,Underworld:Evolution,8,30 June 2007,"Vampire Selene(Kate Beckinsale)& Lycan Michael(Scott Speedman)have a new nemesis to contend with in this installment, newly released(..from his entombment)Marcus Corvinus(Tony Curran), the supremely powerful son of the forefather of both vampires and lycans, Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus wishes to release his uncontrollable werewolf brother(who is simply a raging, breeding monster who can not return to human form with those he bites cursed with the same affliction)from a specific crypt only known by the dead Viktor and Selene. Selene's childhood is touched on more in this sequel as we learn that her father was the one who created and built the very tomb holding the werewolf..Marcus wishes to find out that place through Selene's blood which is why he attempts to catch her. Selene will seek out the very forefather of all mutations, Alexander to seek the truth on why he'd allow such devastation between both factions, vampires and lycans alike, to continue. Meanwhile, we also learn the reasons behind why Marcus would wish to release such a beast upon the world and why he wishes for father Alexander to remain out the picture permanently. Alexander, seeing that no hope for civilization exists as long as Marcus is alive(..he wishes to rule the human race as a god), will allow Selene to drink from his royal blood which will lead to the eventual climactic battle in a castle ruins where the werewolf is entombed.I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed this sequel..it's a merging of both the Gothic and the modern. Set in a sleepy, cold setting where little sunshine is ever seen, we witness endlessly entertaining duels between Marcus(..whose vampire resembles a demon with wings)and his foes, Selene & Michael..including one harrowing sequence where Marcus, in winged demon form flying after them as they drive a truck around treacherous curves on a mountain-side. Lots of graphic violence including flesh often being torn and bodies often being pierced. Marcus often uses the tip of his wings to drive through the shoulders and hands of those he questions. Poor lycan/vampire/human hybrid Michael gets stabbed through(..and thrown in the air and against objects)A LOT. Erotic sex scene between Selene and Michael which shows us their blossoming love for one another. And, last but not least, Kate in tight leather certainly never grows old. I thought the flick had marvelous special effects, including some cool werewolf transformation sequences(..and one doozy of a helicopter crash at the end where the propeller is used as a weapon to great effect).",Underworld - Evolution
12,Hey_Sweden,"If you liked the first one, you'll likely enjoy this one too.",6,6 October 2019,"Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman reprise their roles as leather-clad, ass-kicking vampire warrior Selene and vampire / werewolf hybrid Michael in this decent sequel. The story picks up where the original movie ended; now Selene and Michael are on the lam and determined to obtain exposition regarding the centuries-old war between blood suckers and bloodthirsty canines. Relentlessly pursuing them is thoroughly evil bad guy vampire Marcus (Tony Curran); Selene and Michael attempt to get some help from the legendary Alexander Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi), the man who got the ball rolling on this conflict so many years ago.""Underworld: Evolution"" is okay as far as this kind of entertainment goes. It depicts a bleak, stylized environment that refrains from many primary colours, going for the gusto in terms of action and gore, and trying to deliver a poignant moment here and there. The CGI can be ropey at times - as we all come to expect from this sort of thing - but there is fortunately some practical work as well (like Brian Steele in costume as the fearsome werewolf William, who's been imprisoned for centuries).It really helps to have a largely British cast with such a tale; they lend gravitas where it might not have been delivered otherwise, and the actors all give it their best effort. Curran is a vivid villain, and it's a real treat to have Jacobi in a pivotal role in a modern genre crossover of a movie. Steven Mackintosh is a hoot as a seedy beast who's been the historian for the two clans, but was forced into exile. Some cast members from the original film, like Bill Nighy as Viktor, Shane Brolly as Kraven, and Michael Sheen as Lucian, appear briefly.Director and co-writer Len Wiseman keeps the story moving forward adequately, spices it up with a bit of sex, and gives us a finale where Selene and Michael are fighting their adversaries side by side.Not bad overall, but if one is NOT a fan of the first ""Underworld"", this sequel probably won't get them to change their minds about this series.Filmed in Vancouver.Six out of 10.",Underworld - Evolution
13,CinemaSerf,More fun acrobatics and leather but only if you liked the first one....,7,25 December 2019,"Now this film will only make sense if you saw, and enjoyed, the original in this franchise. As sequels go, it works ok (aside from a strangely miscast Sir Derek Jacobi). The persecuted pairing of Kate Beckinsale and a still rather wooden Scott Speedman race to track down the imprisoned original Lycan ""William"" before the recently awakened super-vampire ""Marcus"" (his brother) can release him and unleash untold terror on the world. Such as it is, the script is a bit stilted but the action scenes are tight and the film moves along quite sharply. As with the first film, probably not for purists of the genre, but it does have the distinct benefit of being half an hour shorter.",Underworld - Evolution
14,poolandrews,"Top gore, Werewolf, Vampire, birds in rubber, explosion & gun filled mayhem.",8,15 July 2006,"Underworld: Evolution starts in 1202 A.D. where a Vampire named Marcus (Tony Curran) uses the army of Viktor (Bill Nighy) to capture his uncontrollable Werewolf Brother William (Brian Steele), Marcus demands that William is unharmed & as such he is imprisoned in a tomb specifically constructed for such a purpose. Jump forward to the present & amongst the Werewolf Vampire war that has raged for centuries sexy Vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has been betrayed by her own kind & is now on the run with Michael (Scott Speedman) who is a Werewolf Vampire hybrid. Meanwhile Marcus is now a winged Vampire bat monster thing & wants to free his Brother William but needs two 'keys' that are shaped as amulets, his Father Alexander (Sir Derek Jacobi) holds one & Selene has the other & since it was her Father who built the tomb Selene is the only living (well in a 500 year old Vampire sense anyway) person who knows where it is. Marcus sets out on a violent quest to find Selene, retrieve the keys, find out where the tomb is, release his Brother & use him to create a new breed of hybrid creature to take over the Earth. However, Selene has different ideas...Directed by Len Wiseman Underworld: Evolution is a sequel to the modestly successful Underworld (2003) which I have to admit I have not seen, I still really liked this film though. The script by executive producer Danny McBride moves along like a rocket & is full of gore, monsters, action, explosions, gun fights, chases & Kate Beckinsale running around in tight fitting rubber outfits packing some serious weaponry & kicking ass which all adds up to a great time as far as I'm concerned, hey I'm easily pleased! I like the visual style, the character's & dialogue were as good as they needed to be while there's a certain seriousness about it that works. The one real negative aspect of Underworld: Evolution is that I found the story & mythology behind it quite tough going for the first half as it refers to events & character's in the previous film which I haven't seen & therefore felt a little lost at times although the mindless action & gore along with Kate Beckinsale fighting monsters in a rubber outfit makes up for it, it's not as easy to get into as say the mythology behind the Blade (1998 - 2004) films which Underworld: Evolutions has more than a passing resemblance to in it's style & structure with Vampires living amongst humans. A lot of theatrical films lately seem to run for well over 2 hours & I personally don't like long films because I just bore easily so I'm delighted to report that Underworld: Evolutions runs for little more than 100 minutes which for me is far more manageable & is another definite plus. As simple, undemanding, fun, entertaining, action packed mindless comic book violence I doubt you'll find much better out there, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Wiseman turns in a stylish film, everything has a light blue tone to it almost as if all the colour has been bleached from the picture. I also noticed that the colour of character's eye's was enhanced & stood out which I thought looked pretty cool. There's plenty of cool angles & neat camera work, Underworld: Evolutions is damned nice to look at. The film is packed with great set pieces & action scenes, from ultra violent The Matrix (1999) style CGI stuffed fights to shoot-outs & a great sequence where Beckinsale is trying to outrun a winged monster in a speeding truck. The sets are gorgeous & the way their lit as well, the monsters are cool & are a mixture of CGI & traditional make-up effects. The obligatory arsenal of weapons is also present, from chromed crossbows to stylish handguns to shotguns & blades such as throwing stars, swords & knives, I'm not sure I agree with the glamorisation of dangerous weaponry but what the hell they still look cool especially when Beckinsale uses them. There's blood & gore aplenty here, impalings, exploding heads, neck biting, slit wrists, stabbings, blood soaked fights & generally speaking the filmmakers weren't afraid to splash the red stuff around as it's here by the bucket load.With a modest sounding budget of about $50,000,000 Underworld: Evolutions looks fantastic with great production design & a real dark Gothic feel to it that I loved. The special effects are great, the cinematography is stylish & it's well made. The acting is OK & a special mention goes to the designer of Kate Beckinsale's outfit which she looks gorgeous in & as far as I'm concerned probably worth watching the film on it's own, but then again I'm easily pleased & a bit of a pervert.Underworld: Evolutions is pure entertainment, if you don't like violence or gore then forget it but if your up for a little comic book action then Underworld: Evolution should be at the very top of your list. It's a great watch & I can't really recommend it any higher, brilliant but violent fun.",Underworld - Evolution
15,dbborroughs,"Better than the first film, but unless you know the first film you're going to be lost",5,5 February 2006,"I disliked the first Underworld a great deal. I thought it was a terrible example of form over content. It looked great but that was all.Somehow I found myself being dragged along to see this second installment. Amazingly I kind of liked it (even though I found myself wondering how much of this, and the earlier film were influenced by the Russian film Night Watch and its source novels).Actually I loved the visuals, some of which knocked my socks off, but the script and the plot left much to be desired. The problem for me is that I never finished the first film. I walked out of it in the theater and I've shut it off several times on cable and DVD. The upshot of this is that I had no idea who or what was going on. I can understand how fans of the first film can love this more. Regrettably if you didn't like or see the earlier film this movie is going to be lost on you.Still if you liked the first film or want to see some great looking action sequences see this movie.",Underworld - Evolution
16,Bunuel1976,"UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION (Len Wiseman, 2006) **",4,18 August 2006,"This sequel to UNDERWORLD (2003) is a more elaborate affair: the original had made effective use of its dark and confined setting - even if the narrative resolved itself with an endless barrage of shoot 'em-ups; this one goes way back to the origin of the vampire/lycanthrope feud, but the plotting is so tortuous that it ends up making little sense (not that anyone really cares one way or the other)!What freshness the presence of gun-toting vampire(!) Kate Beckinsale - clad in skin-tight leather - had possessed, obviously, isn't there the second time around (though she still looks good). The film's deliberately dreary look and the CGI overload are very irritating, however, as is the seemingly omnipotent head vampire/chief villain (with a penchant for stabbing his victims with his over-sized bat wings!). Derek Jacobi's thespian skills are barely whetted with his pivotal but underdeveloped role as the man who 'fathered' both species (by allowing his two 'cursed' sons to live - though he seems to have been monitoring their activities through the ages, even if we're never told to what end!).",Underworld - Evolution

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Adds so much to the first and all in all, a better film",7,30 September 2006,"With the first Underworld being a mix of Godfather in the world of the undead and Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves(as it was originally pitched), it was interesting to see how its sequel would play out. Throughout the first film, we are told how powerful the elders are... and we do get to see some of their strength. At the very end, there is a hint at *the* elder, the strongest... and rest assured, you are treated to about an entire film of said elder. Bigger may not always be better, but here, it very much is. The characters get more background, more development. During the first, I felt somewhat bored at times, but with this, I was intrigued throughout, and following the story closely. The plot adds to the first, picking up basically exactly where it left off and adding background information. It develops nicely throughout, and there are quite a few(but not too many) tiny effective twists, and I don't think I saw any of them coming. The pace is intense, but not overwhelmingly so. The action, in almost every case, is awesome. During several of the biggest scenes, I was on the edge of my seat. Wiseman has a knack for action. Heck, the trailer of either film'll tell you that. The film builds up to an astounding showdown, final battle, and it's one of the best fights I've seen for a while. The effects are amazing. The scope of the whole film is several times bigger than the first. As another reviewer points out, it's kind of like the case with X-Men and X2... the first laid the groundwork, established characters and the ""world"", and the second just utilized that perfectly. The acting is excellent, pretty much all-round. Impressed with how Bill Nighy did in the first, the crew opted for more British actors in this, and their talent pays off, big time. Now, with all that positive said, I'm afraid the negatives must be said, as well... the cinematography, while at times quite good, leaves a bit to be desired, often during the action sequences. You could almost always make out what was going on, but there were several shots that had potential to look much cooler. Also, the back-story... it's a good thing that it's there, but you kind of wish they had a more interesting way of telling you than by the near-constant flashbacks. In this film, Len uses them as the crutch that Kubrick often used narration... only thing is that Stanley implemented his supporting tool much more smoothly. Also, with this sequel, the similarities between this series and The Matrix Trilogy become even more apparent. I'm sure anyone who's seen the trilogy as well as these two films can see what I mean. And the problem that was seen in the X-Men films(as a result of too many powerful characters) is evident... there are times when dubious explanations are employed to keep characters isolated from each other. There is only one in this film, but it's somewhat drawn out and moderately weaker than in those films. Then there are scenes that you wonder if they couldn't have done without... told it in a better way. The exploration of Michael's blood-lust early on in the film is a good idea, but the execution could have been better(first thing to cut: the very unnecessary reaction to the food). And was the sex scene really pivotal? One must wonder if that wasn't terribly awkward to shoot, with Beckinsale being married to Wiseman. All in all, a better film than the first, and much easier and more worthwhile to watch. Good Gothic violent action, with a good story, making for 90 entertaining minutes. I recommend this to any fan of Gothic style, horror and action. Very much an improvement. 7/10",Underworld - Evolution
20,view_and_review,Uncovering the Past,7,12 January 2017,"I recently saw Underworld: Blood Wars in the theater and it inspired me to review the entire franchise. Two days ago I re-watched Underworld (2003) and today I watched Underworld: Evolution.Well shame on me. I skipped right over Underworld: Evolution and didn't even realize or know. With that, I still was able to enjoy the three that followed this one (Rise of the Lycans, Awakening, and the recently released Blood Wars).I didn't quite like Evolution as much as I did Underworld (2003) but it still held its own. This installment was about uncovering Vampire/Lycan history. More information and more secrets were revealed about both species. Again there were many bullets shot (so many rounds of ammo and so many guns) and again Selene (Kate Beckinsale) had to fight some ferocious beasts (both Vampire and Lycan).A sound follow up and link to Underworlds to follow.",Underworld - Evolution

Better than-anticipated sequel to the 2004 ""Underworld"" with vampires Beckinsale in league with 'hybrid' werewolf Speedman out to stop the nefarious 'hybrid' vampire Curran from his plan to dominate the subspecies with no mercy to those who get in his way. Over-the-top and borderline campy with its graphic novel appeal and unapologetic gore galore the film runs on full gusto from beginning to end with some inventive action sequences and not-too-shabby visual f/x (I'm more of the old-school practical horror make-up but the beasties here look better than its predecessor) make up for the loosely structured plotting provided by filmmaker Len Wiseman (who collaborated on the script with Danny McBride). The kick ass last act is worth the price of admission alone.",Underworld - Evolution
22,Uriah43,An Exception to the Rule,7,5 October 2012,"Costing approximately $50 million to produce, this film takes up where the original movie (""Underworld"") left off. Marcus (played by Tony Curran) has awoken from his vampiric slumber with the blood of a lycan (werewolf) now coursing through his veins. With both Amelia and Victor dead, Marcus decides to free his brother William, who as the very first werewolf, was imprisoned because he was so wild and uncontrollable. In order to free William, Marcus needs two keys: One belonging to his immortal human father, ""Alexander Corvinus"" (played by Derek Jacobi) and the other in the possession of ""Michael"" (Scott Speedman) and ""Selene"" (Kate Beckingsale). Rather than reveal the entire plot, I will simply say that this movie makes very effective use of action and computer imagery which definitely enhances the film. Likewise, Kate Beckinsale turns in a superb performance and, quite frankly, looks exquisite both in and out of black leather. Additionally, I think the director (Len Wiseman) deserves a great deal of credit for the success of this picture as he manages to recreate the eerie Gothic look which gives this film (and its predecessor) its unique character. That said, more often than not, sequels are rarely as good as the film they follow. Fortunately, this one is an exception to the rule. If you liked the first movie then I believe you will like this one just as much. Both are equally entertaining.",Underworld - Evolution

I would say it left off exactly, but there is one little problem. How the heck did we end up in Russia? Apparently, the mansion at the end of the previous movie was in Russia the entire time, even though the one guy who was in America walked to the front gate. Aside from this minor oops, we have a pretty good, but not quite as good as the original. The action is good, and the gore is bloody, the problem a lot of shots where they just keep building up tension for the fight. They slowly ease up on the situation, before finally there is some action. The story is not quite up to par either as the lycans or werewolves are virtually absent through much of the film and not really a factor in the plot much at all. Still there are a couple of rather revelations here and there that we learn and things from the previous movie explained. We also get nudity in this one, however, I found this a bit unnecessary. Still though you get some head rippings, some good gore, and a couple of really cool fights. All good, just not up to the first movie.",Underworld - Evolution
25,gradyharp,Viktor's Wings as the Star of the Show,4,10 June 2006,"Some movies are created for special effects carnivals: a subservient storyline serves merely as the glue to hold together 106 minutes of action. Films such as UNDERWORLD - EVOLUTION is one of this genre and if the viewers take it for that they won't be disappointed. Writer (with Danny McBride) and Director Len Wiseman pulled out all the unused parts of the original UNDERWORLD and have recycled them and magnified them into a sequel starring Wiseman's wife Kate Beckinsale and he knows how to make it work.The script for the film is probably only a few pages long so the bulk of the piece is action. And here the real stars appear: Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos, Art Direction by Chris August, Set Decoration by Lin MacDonald and Costume Design by Wendy Partridge are only a few of the names that deserve the credit for the success. Everything is shot in a shade of blue (Simon Duggan is the cinematographer) but of course that is appropriate because it all takes place at night when vampires can function. The story is rather easy to condense: lycans vs vampires with a cross section of a hybrid to spice things up come into a centuries old conflict struggle for power. More than that is unnecessary to know.Kate Beckinsale is ever beautiful and is such a fine actress that she brings some warmth to this comic book heroine. But the rest of the cast is paralyzed by silly dialogue and that holds down the likes of Derek Jacobi, Scott Speedman, unintentionally hilarious bad guy Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen, etc. But keep your eyes focused on the locks, the wonderful wings of Viktor with all that they can do, and the entertainingly gruesome and ultimately tiring 'turning' of men into distortions of werewolves. As for Beckinsale and Speedman, they make a nice couple, but it is more a 'blood in, blood out' romance.Not for the squeamish or those who look for story, but for what it is UNDERWORLD part II and obviously to be continued is a special effects delight.

26,The_Void,"Surpasses the first film, and as good as a sequel to 'Underworld' could be!",8,20 January 2006,"The original Underworld was not as good as it clearly thought it was, but it's an entertaining flick - and in my view at least, good enough for a sequel. Subtitled 'Evolution', (having numbers after the title for a sequel is now out of fashion), this second instalment builds on the original film; while still finding the time for enough action to please it's target audience. Surprisingly for a boisterous action-horror flick, Len Wiseman's second film is more restrained than you would think. Although there are plenty of action sequences, the focus is put more firmly on the plot; and this ensures that the film isn't merely a dull collection of stunts. The film starts off with a great sequence, which goes back to the beginning of the war between the Lycans and the Vampires. We then follow Selene (Beckinsale) and Michael (Speedman), both now on the run after dispatching vampire elder Viktor (Nighy). We follow the pair as they trace their origins and try to ensure that the first ever vampire, Marcus, isn't able to free his brother William; the first of the werewolves.One of the major reasons I enjoyed the first film was due to its leather-clad female lead. The sexy Kate Beckinsale reprises her role under the direction of her husband, and is every bit the sassy heroine that a film like this needs. Underworld: Evolution, like the original film, makes best use of this asset! The acting here is a more than a little bit corny overall; but Beckinsale and the rest of the cast do their jobs well enough to ensure that the film doesn't completely fall down on the acting side. The special effects are good, with the werewolves being particularly of note for being impressive. Werewolves don't often translate to the screen well; but they look just fine in this film! The visuals are dark and Gothic, and look absolutely stunning. As with the first film, the glossy style bodes well with the action scenes and ensures that the film is pleasing to the eye. The best thing about the film for me, however, was the mythology surrounding the war between werewolves and vampires. It's portrayed well, and Wiseman leaves enough gaps to keep the interest, while ensuring that the plot builds to a complete whole by the time the credits role.On the whole, Evolution is a better film than the original. It builds on the first film, and delivers enough new elements to make it interesting to anyone who liked the original. This is the sort of film that wont be remembered long after it's over - but it makes for a great time while watching, and comes highly recommend to horror/action fans!",Underworld - Evolution
27,trashgang,the surprise of it's predecessor is gone but still worth watching,7,15 October 2008,"Part two luckily picks in were the first entry stopped. Well, you have to wait just after the opening credits before that happens. Before ethe opening credits you will get to know what happened to the twins from Corvinus (Derek Jacobi), one is a vampire (Marcus (Tony Curran)), the other a lycan (William (Brian Steele)). First I asked myself why they are showing that part because we already knew that stuff but there's more going on, it's all about the pendants.This entry moves a bit away from vampires living among humans, we do get to know why Selena (Kate Beckinsale) her parents were killed. But there's more going on, slowly she falls in love with Michael (Scott Speedman). We do have one love scene involving nudity from Kate and Scott but it is filmed in a way that they don't show anything. A bit further in the movie we do have bare-breasted women. I had a bit of mixed feelings about Evolution because here soldiers are involved and there's a lot of shooting going on. Still, it never leaves what is told in th eoriginal flick. Also, the wire-effects used in Underworls are a bit left out of Evolution and that was a particular thing in Underworld. But we had to sit through the whole story because we had to know what is going on between the twins and Selene.Effects used were sublime especially in the way Marcus was flying around.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Underworld: Evolution,6,4 March 2006,"After Kate Beckinsale's Seline character got around kicking massive rear in slinky black Lycra, we had Charlize Theron doing the same in Aeon Flux, and coming soon, Milla Jovovich in Ultraviolet. Sexy costumes, menacing weapons and killer moves seem to be the order of the day. It's no doubt that Underworld would have a sequel, since it was obviously hinted at after the end credits of the original, though it would be three years before it materialized.And Kate Beckinsale still looked as hot as the pasty-white faced, black and blue eyed vampire known as a Death Dealer. Actually, that's one of the extremely few good things about this movie. We get to see her more, see her in action more (*ahem* love scene some more to keep the fan boys happy) with her twin rapid firing handguns, and flitting around action sequences without tearing her outfit.The other good thing about this movie, is if you're a fan of blood and gore, you'll be kept happy with the many decapitations in various creative ways, piercings, shootings (at point blank), and endless gunfire.Unfortunately, these good points were thin after a while, and seriously, you'll be clock watching for it to end. The movie starts off by going back to the early beginnings of the feud and tries to explain blood ties and brotherly love, in the times when the Death Dealers were wearing hand-me-down armor from the elves in Lord of the Rings. For those who are unfamiliar with the first movie, fret not, this movie does spend some time to try and explain the convoluted plot to you in a series of quick flashbacks. Sometimes so much that I think the entire first movie had been told here in fast forward.And what a convoluted plot it is! Somehow you know that our heroes can't die - one's a superhuman hybrid never seen before, while the other is Seline the invincible who defied all odds to survive past the first film. But invulnerability makes a character weak, as it takes away the fun. Injuries heal in record time (ok, so they're vampires who recuperate in the darkness), and you'll really wonder if the Highlander way is the only way for a character to perish. The central plot about brotherhood, and the quest to unleash the very first Lycan was pretty boring stuff.Somehow the production seemed a little lazy too. In the first movie, we had sets which are more in tuned to the present world, with the city and all. But this movie seemed to like darkness and worn out locations, and even the finale set looked suspiciously similar to the original's. And I learnt too that vampires can transfer abilities and skills by letting another suck its blood, much like Chinese Martial Arts films where the kungfu master imparts his skills to his disciples using internal strength - you'll become stronger overnight.I had great hopes that the sequel would present itself as superior to the original, especially if it could develop a strong back story. However I was proved wrong, and this sequel, like many others, pale when compared to the original. I don't think there'll be another sequel given the characters becoming who they are at the end (almost a copy of X-Men 2's camera moving across a body of water shot with voice over), but then again, you'll never know.",Underworld - Evolution
29,siderite,"The first one had brains, this one has brawn. Not bad, though.",7,23 January 2006,"As horror/action/monster movies go, this is one of the good ones. I found myself thinking of the Alien saga watching it. Of course, as Alien 1 presented one creature, its life circle, its motivation, the second was with marines shooting at a lot of angry aliens. Such is the ""evolution"" of Underworld. The sequel is so action packed that it leaves very little space for plot. The story is thus reduced to Lichen/Vampire level 3 battles with Lichen/Vampire level 2, while the poor level 1 creatures from the first film are way weak and powerless.Sounds like a video game? Well, it sure feels like it. I just hope that, as with Alien, the brain will return to the story, like in Alien Resurrection. Else, all is lost. Kate Beckinsale already has a boyfriend one does not want to mess around with and the bad guys are all gone, even the big and scary ones, so another more evil and more powerful would just push it too far, like poor Blade 3.",Underworld - Evolution

I mean, don't get me wrong, I love vampire films and action flicks, also it wasn't a bad movie at all. Just I couldn't get into it. One of my friends recommended the sequel still, and I figured I should give it a shot. While I felt the story was very good and this movie had some incredible stunts and action moments, it just wasn't my cup of tea sort of speak.Kate Beckinsale may have something to do with it, while she's a very beautiful actress and talented in most of her movies, I couldn't believe her as a tough vampire for some reason. Also, I know there is a huge controversy of Vampire vs. Werewolves, it has been a horror fan favorite ""vs."" forever, but again, I just prefer the vampire flicks on their own stands.

31,Rainey-Dawn,Great Sequel,9,15 October 2014,"Evolution is a great sequel! This movie helps to answer a few questions that was left lingering in my mind after the first film.Like the first film in the series, Evolution is a dark, Gothic film with elaborate sets, props, and costuming. The acting (one again) is top notch and the script highly intriguing! The story/plot of Evolution is just a wonderful as the first film in the series. So much action to watch, a superb story and fine performances by all.Fans of the horror genre (especially vampire and lycan fans) will definitely not be disappointed in watching Underworld: Evolution.9.5/10",Underworld - Evolution
32,KineticSeoul,Well at least it's fast paced and feels fast paced this time,6,6 January 2012,"While the first ""Underworld"" movie was fast paced but felt slow, this movie is more fast paced and actually feels fast paced. Although it seemed like not much effort went into the production of this movie, but it was a bit more entertaining than the first movie. When I first saw this, the story didn't seem to drag. Although the story in itself is far from being great and it's average at best. Kate Beckinsale makes her appearance as the protagonist as Selene the vampire who is known as Death Dealer. She is nice to look at and she is good at what she does as the vampire warrior. For a sequel it surpasses the original not because it had more effort gone for it, but it actually felt fast paced this time and somewhat entertaining despite it being shorter than the first one.6.2/10",Underworld - Evolution

Sad we were still subjected to the dreadful (character) Viktor and an outrageously and hilariously bad use of CGI in the opening prequel. But good that we still had the ass-kicking Selene. She's worth the entire viewing and even her sidekick/lover Michael did a bang up job himself. The score, action and soundtrack are all good and it's not as heavy handed with the ancient mystery as the first was.

35,Robert_duder,A stellar sequel...the series keeps getting better,8,8 February 2006,"If the recipe for a great sequel is double the action, double the gore, double the sex then Underworld Evolution nailed it home!! What Underworld began with being the only unique Vampire/Werewolf film it continues with Evolution. Rather than rehashing the original storyline in any way, Evolution picks up the back story behind some of the elder characters from the original. In fact Evolution creates nearly an entire new storyline from the original. I'm not sure that all the facts and plot points match to the original film but I can't say for sure so I won't nit pick that. Len Wiseman picks up the helm of co-writer and director once again and flawlessly pieces together an incredible sequel.Kate Beckinsale takes up the lead role of Selene again. This time Selene has even more of a bite to her. The character seems more rounded like Beckinsale has really come into the role and it's even better than before. She's dark and deadly!! She still creates one of the best action heroes in film history!! Scott Speedman returns as Michael Corvin, Selene's love interest and the only vampire/werewolf hybrid in existence. Both of them are on the run following Selene's murder of Viktor, the vampire Elder. She desperately needs someone to believe her about Viktor's part in starting and continuing the feud between them. The story definitely focuses more on Speedman's character than the original did which in some ways is unfortunate because Speedman is not as good as the rest of the cast. He's adequate and the chemistry between him and Beckinsale is okay but to rely the entire story on him is a big movie. All the original cast members return either in the story or in flashbacks going back to the ancient origins of their species. Tony Curran takes the role of Vampire elder meant to rule Marcus who is more powerful than imaginable after being awakened. All he desires to do is free his brother who is a Lycan from eternal imprisonment. Although Curran is buried under make up for the film he is still a kick-butt bad guy and seemingly unstoppable. Veteran character actor Derek Jacobi takes the role of Corvinus, the father of Marcus and his brother. He's not in the film much but he does well in the role as he tries to help Selene contain his sons.The story is far more intense than the original and slightly easier to follow although I promise you you'll enjoy the sequel 100 times more if you've seen the original immediately beforehand. The two films definitely meld together the story. It's a very complex plot for an action film and you must watch and follow closely. The romance heats up ten fold between Speedman and Beckinsale culminating with a rather steamy sex scene (I hope Wiseman took that day off when his wife was shooting the scene!) The action is beefed up with some incredible stunts and much more hand to hand combat than gun play like the original. And the gore...well the original had no hint of being a horror flick but the gore is quadrupled from the original. There is some really gut wrenching, blood soaked moments that are pretty damn cool!! If you saw the original you absolutely must continue and see the sequel because this is one second part that is even better than the original. Continue this franchise for the love of films!! 8/10",Underworld - Evolution
36,richardchatten,The Name's Selene...,6,13 October 2019,"There's been a lot of tiresome talk in recent years about the desirability of making James Bond a woman and calling it ""reinvention"". But instead of trashing yet another long-established classic franchise, why not simply create a new one?We've already had a truly badass female action heroine for over fifteen years in the supple form of Selene: an English rose in black PVC capable of driving a truck with one hand while blowing away winged bad guys with an Uzi in the other; a sort of death-dealing Emma Peel who arrives by helicopter to kick ass (but why did she have to be the only woman aboard?).It's probably just commercial timidity - and laziness - that has so far rendered it beyond the wit of today's filmmakers to create a non-vampiric Selene and - Bingo! - you've got your female James Bond!

37,bowmanblue,Not bad for a sequel,8,24 January 2015,"With the possible exceptions of Aliens, Terminator 2 and Empire Strikes Back, it's widely regarded that all sequels to horror/sci-fi films are of inferior quality to the original. However, I think that Underworld 2 (or 'Evolution' as it's better known) is actually at least on a par with the original.For a start the same creative team was behind it (which always helps), the story picks up right where its predecessor left off and it actually expands the whole Underworld universe.Whether you like this or not will largely depend on whether you liked the original. It's not as if they just re-did the original script, but it's such a continuation, you really need to watch the films in order for you to fully get the importance of this one.One downside which people kept making was how this second outing constantly uses flashbacks in order to recap the story from the first one. I guess this is just for those who are watching this film without seeing the first.However, assuming you've watched and enjoyed the first, you really can't go wrong with the second - you have more action, more vampires and werewolves (none of which twinkle in sunlight!) and Kate Beckinsale in more rubber (but that's probably only a plus point for the guys).",Underworld - Evolution
38,ThomasDrufke,Look Into the Light,6,4 January 2017,"Looking at Underworld Evolution as a mindless action adventure, it's not all that bad. It doesn't take itself too seriously, there are some well-directed action sequences, and the characters are far more realized than they were the first time around.Let's just be honest, the first Underworld is garbage. There's no two ways about it. The dialogue is horrible, the performances are over the top, and the visual effects are dated. But with the three years in between the first and the second, something must have clicked within the writer's room. Evolution is about 30 minutes shorter and much less convoluted than the first entry. When there are exposition-heavy scenes, they add to the story, instead of making things more confusing. I've already spent a couple hours with Selene & company, so I was prepared with the lore and character history. Plus, wasn't it nice getting Kraven out of the way early on in the film? Horrible character.Len Wiseman isn't the most talented director in Hollywood, or the smartest (considering he wants to make a Die Hard prequel), but I think he knows what people want out of these movies. Kate Beckinsale and some cool vampire-werewolf action are the primary reason these movies make money. While the main villains are set up nicely through flashbacks in the opening scene, they end up having little differences to Bill Nighy's first film villain.Part of the appeal of this particular Underworld entry is that it's in many ways, a fantasy-horror-western. Sure, it doesn't take place in the wild west, but the way the story is set up is very much similar to that of typical westerns. Selene and Michael spend the entire film on the run and in search of a mystical artifact linked to the past of their species. At the same time, this film suffers from the same problems as most vampire flicks do, the untouchable nature of vampires contributes to a less visceral experience if you know they will ultimately survive whenever they die. In all, it's hard to think I would ever watch this film again, but it's entertaining enough for me to give it a positive review.+Solid action+Characters are more realized+Western-Villains are weak-So.. are they untouchable?6.0/10",Underworld - Evolution
39,MLDinTN,Guns and fighting...,4,26 December 2006,"don't make a good movie. It takes a decent story also, which this movie lacks. Why are guns the weapon of choice for Selene in fighting werewolves and vampires. I mean, she doesn't even use silver bullets. Shooting 20 shots at a werewolf doesn't kill it. Some of the special effects were OK, but some were cartoonish. There are some good gore scenes for all the gore freaks. How can you not like when the badest werewolf gets the top part of his head and jaw torn off. Also the badest vampire gets ground up by a helicopter blade. Cool. Question: Why didn't the father of the original vampire and werewolf do anything to try to stop them? He seemed to want to help Selene but used the ole they are my children, I can't hurt them? What? He didn't want them to succeed.Seeing this also makes you feel for poor Scott Speedman, who once had a promising career on Felicity. Now, he can't even get a lead role in any film since the first Underworld. Of course, he doesn't have much acting talent and should go back to TV.FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you liked the first one, you would like this. But for the average viewer, it doesn't have enough of a story to hold your interest.",Underworld - Evolution

The first movie was pretty good but I wasn't highly anticipating the sequel. Well it's definitely as good as the first one perhaps a little better. There is more gore, action, and nudity here. And that pleased me.This time the battle between the vampires and the Lycans get worse while the romance between Selene and Michael deepens. Also they have to face the ruthless vampire elder, Marcus.The acting is pretty good. Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and a beautiful one at that. Scott Speedman is certainly better than he was in the first film.Overall, this will please fans of Gothic movies like this. Len Wiseman made another great movie.

The first movie is decent, but not anything to write home about. This one is much worse, and deadly dull in my opinion. For starters it's dreary looking; I didn't get the vibe I did from Kate Beckinsale like I did in the first one. She was one of the main reasons I didn't mind the first one, but here I didn't get that same feeling. It has some alright action scenes; Bill Nighy always adds class to anything he's in, but there just wasn't anything special about this movie. I'd like to know why this is rated 6.6?; I personally think it's around the 5 mark or so, and that is way too high for such an average sequel. Final Thoughts: If you liked the first one, you may enjoy this one. If you thought the first one was merely decent, than you might feel differently like I did.

42,Bored_Dragon,Underworld Franchise (2003-2016),7,14 December 2019,"Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)""Evolution"" continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)""Rise of the Lycans"" is an ""origins story"" and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10",Underworld - Evolution
43,tabuno,So Much Potential Went Underground,5,22 January 2019,"5 July 2006. There was so much opportunity and creative excitement that this movie offered but what ended up on the movie screen was almost unintelligible, poor pacing, poor editing, poor script continuity. I couldn't ever tell what really was going on even though attempts were made to provide some overview. The special ops idea was neat but was quickly dispatched. The ultimate source of evil was also not up to the task. By the time of the movie ended, the predictable and overused climax occurred. All of the elements for a good horror classic were there but unfortunately, the director failed to put it together in a meaningful, coherent way. The movie was tolerable and made sense but failed to realize the significance of the what conceptual components of old and new, sophisticated and intelligence that could have been put on full display. Five out of Ten Stars.",Underworld - Evolution
44,The-Sarkologist,The Saga Continues,5,20 January 2012,"This film begins at where the previous film ended, though there is a prologue set hundreds of years before where we are given a glimpse of the beginnings of the conflict between the werewolves and the vampires. We learn that the lines come from two brothers, one was bitten by a bat and the other bitten by a wolf, and as such they were cursed with their respective curses. You do hear of their father, but he is apparently in the background at this stage, and doesn't really seem (at this time) to be a major part of the film.The main theme that I noticed in this film is the extent of the brotherly bond, and the father-son bond. It was almost as if the idea was taken from the bible namely where King David refuses to lay a hand of violence upon his son Absolom, despite Absolom having usurped his throne and waged a war against him. It is only when Absolom is found by some of David's men that he is slain, and even then David mourns bitterly at his loss, and has to be rebuked by his men for behaving in such an atrocious manner.There are similarities here (yes the father does make an appearance, and appears to be immortal, but it is unclear what it is that makes him immortal since he was neither bitten by a bat or a wolf) in that despite his sons running rampant across the world, causing chaos and destruction, he refuses to lay a finger on them. Further, despite the bother (the Lycan) being a ravenous beast, the other brother, once again, refuses to lay a hand of vengeance on him. While this is not the brother's downfall, it is the father's, and it is tragic in a sense because the father, through his refusal to discipline his sons, becomes a victim of their outrage.The makers of the film were sued by White Wolf (makers of the Vampire and Werewolf Roleplaying Games) for breach of copyright. This, in my opinion, is ridiculous. While there were a couple of instances where I could say that yes, that was taken from White Wolf, I would hardly call it a breach of copyright. To me it simply looked like a way to cash in on the movies' success, without actually doing anything to earn it (other than sue the film makers). As the matter settled confidentially out of court, it is just one more aspect of this matter that suggests that White Wolf's claim was quite spurious, and the only reason they reached an out of court settlement was that it would have been too expensive to run to trial (which is one of the tactics plaintiffs use to attempt to extort money from defendants).",Underworld - Evolution

And that because this movie I believe that it has not as much scenes with suspense as the first one and I also think that story progression was not as nice as I expected it to be. Although I have to say that for one more time the interpretation of Kate Beckinsale was really good such Scott Speedman's also was.Finally I have to say that despite all the previous facts I recommend this movie but you have to be prepared that this movie it is not as good as the first one.",Underworld - Evolution
48,johnnyboyz,'Underworld' isn't quite 'Out of this World',6,27 January 2006,"The circumstances surrounding me seeing this film were rather frustrating, as I will explain. My local cinema had 'Jarhead' listed down as a 21:00 start on their web site, so I made it to arrive there in time for that. However, when I got there five minutes to the hour, I was only to discover that it had started at 20:30 for some reason and as a result, missed out on seeing it. The 'new' 21:00 screening was this and I wasn't prepared to waste a trip so I decided to see it.Bear in mind that I haven't seen the first Underworld film whilst commenting on this and I do not make it a habit of seeing sequels before first films, but the situation that be-fell me was unfortunate to say the least. The story of the film may sound pretty basic but if you look a little deeper you have quite a sophisticated idea in the mould revolving around a war between two of classical Hollywood's 'classic monsters', i.e.; the werewolves (bizarrely named 'lycans') and vampires. However, these aren't your typical conventional classical horror vampires, in fact they are almost straight out of 'Blade' (1998) given the fact they're all mainly young, handsome, rebellious and have a thirst for guns as well as blood.Although a little tricky to follow at first, the story opens up through a series of flashbacks to what I presume to have been the first film. For me, this was vital as I was going in blind on this one but for others who have seen the first one, it seems that the flashbacks were unnecessary and, in a way to some, almost 'insulting'. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I was really in the dark when the film got going after the opening fight scene at the snowy village. Various different events and characters were building up/happening and it was rather overwhelming. The film DID regain some clarity, however, when they visited a character known as 'Tanis' (Played by an actor I instantly recognised from 'Lock, Stock...') These included the back ground on a certain key/emblem as well as rather important flashbacks the heroine has of the childhood and how everything is connected. For people seeing this without seeing the first film, I felt this scene was pretty important. Various fight scene dotted throughout the film also aided the cause.At times, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to impress the audience. Everything seemed very dark and Gothic, which I can understand it being a horror film involving vampires which have to stay out of light, but it seemed very forced; all most as if you were trying to read a comic book on a subway train with the electrics cutting out at random moments- the story is there for you to follow but it's hard to make everything out entirely if you see what I mean. There are also significant references to other action films made in the last 10-15 years. Nearer the end, it seems nothing more than a montage of Terminator/Matrix-esquire stunts and set pieces which are there to build everything up to its rather predictable climax, and that can't be good. However, the acting was all right and the camera work was rather artistic. The editing is sharp and unnoticeable, especially the few full frontal shots of Beckinsale's character in her cat suit which occur at random parts of the film which cut off to the next shot JUST as you realise what you're looking at. The fight scenes and sparse use of slow motion also keep everything feeling unique as does the constant presence of the antagonist vampire whom remains a menacing threat throughout. The film doesn't come without its gore; in fact most of the actors could probably write a dissertation on how good/bad the fake blood tastes given the amount of times we see it in their mouths, not to mention the amount of takes it probably took for them to get it right(!) Let that be a hint of what to expect along with the point blank shooting, werewolf decapitation and true 'Evil Dead' style melee attacks from certain characters. I probably would've enjoyed this a little more if I had seen the first film first (as I've explained, I haven't) but it did alright for me in the end and fans of the first will probably love this one if it's supposedly better than the first.",Underworld - Evolution
49,filipemanuelneto,"A lot of action, a lot of high quality CGI, but a terribly bad story and a terrible director.",3,15 July 2020,"This was the second film in the ""Underworld"" franchise but I saw it in third place, after ""Underworld"" and the prequel ""Underworld 3"". In this film, we follow the continuation of the events of the first film: Selene and Michael flee the vampires and the Lycan that chase them, while the oldest vampire still alive, Marcus, wakes up to chase them too.It is a typical teen film, full of action and violence. The direction is ensured by Len Wiseman, who continues to show weaknesses such as the exaggerated way in which he cares about the appearance and style, making the film sounds like a video game, absurd and impossible. It is also obvious the disregard in which he treats the script, which is so weak that the whole story sounds unlikely. It was thought to support the action scenes and not the other way around, that is, considering action scenes as a complement to a well-structured story. As a result, the film loses impact and interest as the minutes go by and everything becomes simply over the top and excessive.The cast is led, again, by sexy Kate Beckinsale, who is good at the task of looking cool and tough but exaggerates in her performance and has no chemistry with her romantic partner, Scott Speedman, who is basically a decorative figure. Derek Jacobi is very regal in a film unworthy of him, Steven Mackintosh is uninteresting and Tony Curran exists only to appear to be violent and bad... permanently. The rest of the cast doesn't matter.Technically, it is a film that bets almost everything on action scenes that are stylish and too incredible to be realistic. We almost never feel the danger or risk that the characters have to face because of this permanent exaggeration. The special effects and CGI are the best and they must have cost a considerable portion of the film's budget. Almost all monsters and werewolves were well made and designed. However, filming is banal, cinematography is permanently gloomy and blue and soundtrack is the same one that has been used in other films so far.",Underworld - Evolution
50,TheMovieDiorama,Underworld: Evolution neither regresses or evolves.,6,14 March 2018,"Three years later, mainstream vampire flicks remain dormant and so Wiseman and his team produce the inevitable sequel. Critics lambasted it, audiences enjoyed it...I'm with the latter. He's upped the budget, increased the action but, yet again, told a thinly written story. The vampire and lycan war rages on, Selene and new hybrid Michael must stop vampire elder Markus from releasing his imprisoned brother William in order to take over the dark bleak world with vampire-lycan hybrids. Basic story is basic, yet somehow feels more convoluted as each chapter is released. In fact, it's so complicated in terms of depicting the Corvinus bloodline that the first few minutes were just exposition. Flashbacks of the previous film to make sure the audience are up to speed. That in itself raises alarm bells. However, despite the bland monotonous story, Wiseman has crafted a consistently entertaining sequel that removes the horror elements and instead injects the narrative with pure action adrenaline. This change-up surprisingly works and will set the franchise off to a new course. Markus seems like the vampire equivalent of 'The Terminator', seemingly unstoppable with his sharp back wing arm things (best description ever). Kate Beckinsale in all her black leather glory is here to save the day, where the two have a fantastically exciting showdown in the third act. Actually, the entire third act is ace. Redeems the entire film from being a melodramatic drag. Derek Jacobi brings in some much needed acting talent with his thespian background, and intriguingly introduces some emotion to the story. Wiseman's insistence on utilising practical effects is always a pleasure to see, although some of the occasional CGI misses entirely. Some excellent production design, particularly the medieval castle in the final battle which ever so reminded me of 'Skyrim'. This sequel really is an onslaught of wet fur, sharp fangs and UV bullets, but it never once failed to entertain me. I can only hope the franchise maintains this consistent level...",Underworld - Evolution

52,matthewssilverhammer,Better Than TwilightBut Just Barely,4,26 September 2017,"Underworld is a melodramatic franchise about warring vampires and wolves, in which people of different species fall in love. The blue-gray aesthetics are bludgeoning, the script is convoluted and convenient, and the lore is incredibly unwieldy. I constantly found myself checking Wikipedia just to keep up. It's definitely not good, even with moments of ridiculous fun in the action and a surprising sense of care in the filmmaking",Underworld - Evolution
53,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Good for a gory monster thrill,5,1 January 2010,"It seems kind of pointless, in my opinion, to develop such an extensive mythos and history for a centuries old vampires vs. lycans (werewolves) premise when everyone's just going to try and kill each other anyway. Underworld creators Len Wiseman and Danny McBride impressively flesh out their world and backstory, especially so in ""Underworld: Evolution"" -- then they have all the characters' rip each others flesh out. It's fun for those looking for an imaginative gore-fest, but don't expect to feel deeply invested in the unnecessarily complex story. I imagine if I were in Wiseman and McBride's shoes, I would want to carefully craft my story down to the finest of details and take great pride in my own creation -- but that seems like a lot of energy expended just riddle a film with bullets and blood. Fans of the 2003 film, however, are apt to expect that and in that end they won't be let down.The film picks up right where the original left up and reminding us of the key pieces: Selene (Beckinsale) has killed vampire patriarch Viktor (Bill Nighy) and she and vampire/lycan hybrid Michael (Speedman) are now on the run from the one remaining patriarch of the coven, Marcus. To go any further into the story would take an essay's worth of writing.So neither will the fans who actually enjoyed the backstory and wanted to learn more be disappointed. But doing supporters a solid doesn't make ""Evolution"" great by default.From the opening scene back in the past with all the vampire immortals decapitating lycans in the snow, Wiseman lets you know this is all about bloody, gruesome death. He wants to catch you muttering ""awesome"" under your breath as many times as possible. It would've been nice for him to be a bit more selective and not actually construct plot events around creative death scene ideas to make the goriest ones stand out a bit more, but why be nitpicky?Wiseman is also a fan of the vampire sex appeal thing. There's some blood and nudity which is certain to get a select groups' blood flowing and it's incredibly deliberate and non- essential. It can definitely be accused of being bloody vampire porn, but let's just call it Wiseman aiming to please his audience.""Underworld: Evolution"" is mindless monster action thriller with a lore/backstory that vies to outdo the Old Testament. Fans of the genre will find parts of it to enjoy, fans of ""Underworld"" will love it and I enjoyed it just enough to feel like I wasn't wasting my time.",Underworld - Evolution
54,Anonymous_Maxine,"""An unknown chapter lies ahead...""",7,26 January 2009,"The first thing that I noticed about Underworld Evolution was not how much it added to the story of the original film, but how strikingly similar it is. It's more like a continuation not of the story began in the original film, but a continuation of the film itself, like they had completed this whole movie back in 2003 but just cut the movie in half and gave us half of it then and the rest of it now. Not that that's a bad thing. Tarantino pulled that off with much success with the Kill Bill movies, but the problem is that many of the things that were disappointing about the original movie are also disappointing about this one. That being said, it's certainly true that fans of the first film will remain fans of the series after seeing the first sequel. Clearly their interests were at the forefront of screenwriter Danny McBride's (yeah, that one) mind when he wrote the script. But for all of the similar shallowness and ineffective action scenes, it's true that they have heard the cries of the public over some of the problems of the first film. There is in this movie, for example, the appearance of real light for the first time in the series, although it's interesting that they should fill it with a romance that is totally out of place and then some sex scenes that are, ah, not entirely unwelcome. Unfortunately, aesthetically pleasing or not, the sex is so out of place and an obvious pandering (to who, I'm not entirely sure) that it looks like it belongs in an entirely different movie. Personally, I felt a little awkward by knowing that Kate Beckinsale's husband, Les Wiseman, was behind the camera while she was on screen naked with Scott Speedman. I can never understand that.Kate Beckinsale is back as the death-dealer, Selene, and Scott Speedman is back as Michael, her half werewolf/half vampire lover, and this time they are on the run since Selene killed Viktor at the end of the original film and the hunt for his killer, she understands, is inevitable. Underworld Evolution teaches us more about the past of the three rulers and the origins of the great war between the vampires and the lycans. Markus is an older and more powerful vampire than Viktor, and he has a brother named William. And William is not only immortal but also the original vampire, and not only his brother but also his twin brother. And just when I'm thinking that their poor parents must be a little dismayed at the supernatural bickering that their kids have been doing for centuries, we meet their father, who is, shall we say, growing weary of the bickering.The special effects are impressive, much more than in the original film. I remember being struck by how dated they seemed in the first movie, and while the transformation effects in this movie are still totally unconvincing, they are certainly more detailed. The graphics have gotten much better, but I'm curious when and if CGI is ever going to be able to convince anyone that it's anything other than CGI. Others are highly impressive, however. There are the most realistic werewolves in this movie that I've ever seen, and the character of Markus is probably the movie's greatest achievement. There is a chase scene that calls to mind the chase scene at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and if the movie had more scenes like it it would have been much better.Unfortunately, among other things, the movie copied-and-pasted the snooze-inducing battle scenes from the original film. For two species of creatures that can be neither killed nor even harmed (for more than a few seconds) by knives or guns, I'm amazed at how many of them bring knives and guns to the battles. Maybe this is why they have managed to stay at war for nearly 1,000 years without either side killing the other off? At any rate, it is definitely the reason why the constant rattle of machine-gun fire does absolutely nothing to make the action in the movie at all interesting.The story, on the other hand, again tries to tell more than the material can sustain. It's wordy and dense, and again goes for that Old English formality from the original film that gives the vampires a feeling of authenticity but also conflicts with the fact that they have so much high technology. Thankfully, however, the movie is less of an assault on the ears, as director Les Wiseman has smartly veered away from the heavy metal route and instead relied on horror composer Marco Beltrani for the film's score. The result is a more traditional vampire feel in a film overflowing with special effects and pointless gunfights, although the combined effect is not entirely disappointing. The appearance of Alexander Corvinus (in a classy performance by Derek Jacobi), the father of Markus, Viktor, and William, lends respectability to the story, although they would have done well to give him more screen time. But he is a necessary element in this most modern version of the vampire/werewolf story, which otherwise might have suffered from having too many young beautiful people in it. I have to say that there are times that I lament the total passing of the time when vampire movies were classy endeavors of subdued horror, starring characters who suffered quietly even while radiating style and a strange sexuality, where the blood was representative and effective and not spraying all over the place. Underworld Evolution is so identical to the original film that it's worth saying that your opinion is almost surely dependent on how much you liked the original. Although there are more improvements than regressions",Underworld - Evolution
55,GOWBTW,This movie surpasses the first! BIG TIME!,10,20 January 2006,"The sequel to ""UNDERWORLD"" is totally outstanding. The special effects, the graphics, and the action was indeed top notch. Selene(Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman) were indeed a very top notch team against the world of vampires and lycans. I enjoyed every minute of it. Selene has never lost her edge in fighting, and Corvin did himself well against the lycans as well. For Corvin being a half-breed, makes the other monsters second best, and Selene gave him some encouragement about his condition. Although Corvin had to learn the hard way about being a half-breed. Especially, when he tries to eat regular food which doesn't responds to his system well. For the others in the first movie, Kraven(Shane Brolly) met his end against Marcus(Tony Curran), he makes Viktor(Bill Nighy) a very distrustful leader of the vampires. Knowing the secrets of one another got the two fighters closer to the truth, and the father Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi) was a victim of his own pride. Knowing he could no longer trust his sons, he only puts his trust Selene. Talk about the ultimate sacrifice. I thought only a slit on the wrist would do him in. Nope! He must be stronger than I thought. This movie is so action packed, I could see this movie again and again. I couldn't get enough of Beckinsale. Her body is so hot, after her daughter, she still can flaunt it well! I didn't see not one sweat droplet. And the women will love Speedman as well. I enjoyed most was the truck scene. Making the driver leave was funny, and Selene can handle that Ford truck well, even if the side of it ate the face of the mountain, and Marcus. No wonder Ford said, ""BUILT FORD TOUGH!"" They weren't kidding! Full of action, full of the fun, ""Underworld: Evolution"" is the top of its game! It's worth the watch! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Underworld - Evolution
56,FiendishDramaturgy,No Home Run For Wiseman...More Like He Was Walked to Second Base!,7,23 February 2006,"More Fun on the Second ViewingAs someone who found the first installment of this series fun, provocative, and nearly legendary, I found this much-awaited sequel somewhat of a disappointment on the first viewing.The prequel segment was far too short. It gave us the set up for the second installment and NOTHING of the back-story of the original, as was promised! The filming style of the prequel segment was the worst aspect, as it lacked the epic treatment most fans expected in this age of CGI brilliance and considering this entire production was filmed on the immense blue-screen stages set for ""I, Robot."" It was also filmed in Vancouver, BC rather than the more exotic locales of the first installment. All background was CGI. You would have expected more love to have gone into this prequel work, for which all the fans have been clamoring since the film's unexpected Hit.They've brought in new characters as principle personages. These are characters never even mentioned in the first work, giving the audience the sense that this work was hurried and just thrown together in desperation. Such was not the case, but the illusion was complete with the inclusion of the gratuitous sexual content obviously thrown in as a distraction away from the fact that this work was lacking. Of course, it also served as an obvious device to placate the fanboys of this genre and this series (Kate Beckinsale's butt in tight leather, in other words). Unfortunately, it was 100% gratuitous, as it had nothing whatsoever to do with the story line and was wholly unnecessary to the plot even after they fidgeted so hard to make it part of the thread.The story itself felt contrived, like they were reaching desperately for something...ANYthing...and just ran with what they brainstormed in one weekend. The story was there, but was missing some serious elements. This was another contributing factor in the work's feeling rushed and incomplete.Regardless of the above mentioned misgivings, this chapter of the Underworld saga was filled with tense moments, clever ideas, and (other than the prequel sequences) was filmed in a near-epic Gothic (almost film noir...NOT, but almost) style. Wiseman strove to maintain the same Gothic feel of the original and, while it was vaguely dispelled by the lack of genuine locations and architecture, it was still a tangible Gothic atmosphere even with the prolific use of CGI.While the story felt (as stated above) like an abbreviated contrivance, it also held some interesting elements. I won't detail those, as I'd rather not give away the best parts of this otherwise straight-to-video-quality work. Beckinsale reflects some of her character from ""VanHelsing,"" this time around. Instead of the stoic matron of leather from the first Underworld, this time we get a hot-blooded Undead who will do what she can for her man. Nice sentiment from one of a race which is not supposed to be capable of love. But the ""Vampyre Rules"" put aside, they somehow made this story line flow well from one abrasive element to the other, without much interruption and distraction. The action sequences are awesome, and the set designs are inspired, but with the major disappointments upon first viewing, I couldn't give it more than a 6.2/10.Upon second viewing, however, with the initial shock and the let down of the prequel sequences out of the way, I found it was better than I'd first rated it; at least a 7.4/10. The reason most reviewers have regarded this work as ""uneven"" is because of the previously mentioned elements: the prequel was poor quality in comparison to the remainder of the film, the effects were awesome while the story line felt hurried and compromised, and the action was astounding while the characters portraying the action should have been better introduced. That, my friends, is uneven epitomized, regardless of the caliginous atmosphere.Again, it rates a 7.4/10 because it was a decent sequel from... the Fiend :.",Underworld - Evolution
57,thinker1691,The Macabre World of the Blood Hybred,8,16 June 2006,"Once again, the wondrous world of the Vampire descends upon the modern audience. However, if filmmakers are to succeed in this dark genera, the ingredients must be sufficient to capture and hold the attention of an increasingly sophisticated viewer. Thus any attempt to hold an audience today must not be aimed at the adult, but at the terrifying nightmare world of the child. Spare the incredible and you lose your audience. Underworld, The Evolution, has done just that. It fires the imagination with a Gothic story which spans centuries and synthesizes it with the latest in special effects and modern weaponry. The Result, a superb, action-driven and utterly fantastic film which entreats and then terrifies the curious and medieval child in each of us. Adding to the darkly savage, high speed, bullet-ripping landscape is the rare appearance and over the top performance of Sir Derek Jacobi as Alexander Corvinus. He is aptly aided by Tony Curran and Scott Speedman as his sons, Michael and Marcus Corvinus. Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene.

It's from these that arise some of the best improvements of the sequel over the original, as well as some of its most troubling questions.A lot of people were taken off guard by the success of the first ""Underworld"" in 2003 and the film has since been embraced by the Goth community, horror movie buffs, and a few above average film-goers as a semi-cult classic. So you can expect that the stakes would be high this second time out. Sequels are tricky: there's a lot riding on them and sequel history shows us that not too many are able to reach beyond their predecessor.Two of the primary actors from the first ""Underworld"" return - Kate Beckinsale as sexy-as-hell, black-leather-clad Selene and Scott Speedman as human-turned-werewolf-turned-vampire-turned-hybrid Michael - and ""Evolution"" is set directly after the events of the first film. Selene and Michael are on the run from treacherous Kraven (Shane Brolly), his goons and members of their coven, and have retreated to the relative sanctuary of a forest safe house. More on that later.For now, Kraven seeks to gain absolute power by eliminating only-remaining vampire elder Marcus (Tony Curran), who was originally thought by him to have still been in hibernation but is already reawakened and slaughters him and his henchmen. With elder Viktor (Bill Nighy) and werewolf clan leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) both gone, Marcus seeks to retrieve two ancient keys so that he can awaken his murderous full-blooded lycan twin brother William (stuntman Bill Steele) from a centuries-old slumber.Selene and Michael, meanwhile, seek to prevent this from happening, and are drawn closer together as they begin to consummate their relationship, alliances change, violence continues, and they both learn the dark secrets of their separate but equally important pasts. With the reluctant aid of an exiled vampire named Tanis (Steven Mackintosh) and the mysterious Alexander (Derek Jacobi), they're in a race against time to stop the rapidly evolving Marcus from unleashing his imprisoned brother.On a technical level, it's aesthetically brilliant and pleasing to the eyes with more ominous set design, and it is easy to appreciate director Len Wiseman and screenwriter Danny McBride's ""Underworld"" films. The cinematography allows to you to dive into a universe quite unlike our own and is one of the most distinctive places ever captured on film. But it's also easy to take notice that not a whole lot of more interesting stuff happens there.True the film flows better than the original and that's why I give it a 9, plus the lush visuals. Only problem is, ""Underworld"" mythology seems to get hurt in the process. That's the huge problem with self-contained mythology: things can sometimes get lost in the confusion. We get to learn a lot in ""Underworld: Evolution,"" but there's a lot of puzzles and not really enough genuine deception and intrigue to satisfy those outside the core fan base. I will admit, however, that I am a little sketchy when it comes to the details linking the two films together, so I will not waste time with any grievances over continuity.On the plus side, it's nice to see primaries Beckinsale and Speedman back in form, and even a little romance develops between the two (even though director Wiseman thought to leave that out of the first movie, and the camera just barely misses some explicit nudity during his wife's love scene with her co-star). Both handle themselves better this time out, and the blood + gore that culminates as a result of their actions is much more plentiful.All in all, ""Underworld: Evolution"" evolves beyond its predecessor, though I'm not confident enough to recommend it, or the original ""Underworld,"" to anyone else who may not be a fan of this sort of movie. I liked the original ""Underworld"" and as this film's ending may hint, a third trip into this universe is just off the horizon. Selene's narration, like the rolling tides of the ocean and glorious sunshine that make up the film's closing shots, indicate that the third time out may be the last. Of course, this is only an assumption.9/10",Underworld - Evolution
60,Chris_Docker,A superb sequel for fans - others should avoid.,7,21 January 2006,"Underworld Evolution is a film for fans of the genre - if you like it, prepare for two hours of undiluted pleasure or, if not, then I suppose all the epithets along the lines of 'boring, derivative, banal, underwhelming tosh' are fully justified. Read on: if you are put off by the description that follows, maybe this film is not for you and I've done my job. If you enjoyed the first film in the series, or (as one of the uninitiated) these tantalising glimpses of high-tech goth makes it appeal, then read on - for the more you know about the mythology first the better (since the film itself wastes little time explaining itself).Underworld is a dark domain where age-old enmity between Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) is played out with terrifying fury. Normal people are fairly peripheral to the plot (vampires have emergency blood transfusion type supplies to save the need to attack humans). Both sides are armed not only with traditional blood-sucking and flesh-tearing fang-capacity, but with all the gadgetry of customised guns and other scientific paraphernalia with which to track and kill each other. Here is no disneyfied world of a timid picture-book 'Dracula' hidden in a battered old coffin somewhere - these guys exult in state-of-the-art locking crypts, massive stone fortresses, and raids conducted with military precision. The film unashamedly boasts an adults-only certificate and has consummate amounts of nastiness, gore, head-ripping and scary battles as well as realistic dollops of sex.Apart from the actual mechanics (such as reaction to sunlight, ways of causing death), the vampires of Underworld have little in common with their namesake in literature - a fascinating creature that slowly saps its victim of strength. Several other fables are instead interwoven, perhaps the most obvious being a Romeo and Juliet type love affair between the beautiful Selene (Vampire heroine, played by Kate Beckinsale) and Michael, the Lycan hybrid. There is also a Beauty and the Beast charm since both these characters display very human qualities at times, such as their tenderness towards each other and the desire to minimise suffering. We long for them to rise above the terrible disease that pumps in their veins. There is a 'Mad Scientist' type underlay with the development of specialised weaponry and the search for the pure strain (giving rise to Matrix-style battles) and, last but not least, Underworld borrows from the X-Men idea of mutations and stylistically from more polished films of a not dissimilar ilk such The Crow or Blade.The name Selene means the moon goddess, who was known for her countless love affairs and also her purity. Her sister was Eos, the dawn. Michael is a Hebrew word meaning 'he who is like God'. But we're hardly interested in the psychology of plot structure and name-conundrums at this point, are we? The thrill comes from watching Beckinsale (Selene) in a leather catsuit kick ass all the way to the nemesis, or seeing the potentially very scary (and equally photogenic) Scott Speedman (Michael) show his gentle side as he gets her kit off, or actors of the calibre of Derek Jacobi and Bill Nighy play really cruel, vicious, malevolent creatures that haven't been toned down for the under-18yr-olds, or the inventive and bloody battles in fabulously Gothic settings. There's lashings of blood every few seconds; sex mixed with blood for the pervy; and tasteful, delicate sex to remind us we're watching something artistic and not downright depraved (even if we are). If anything, Underworld: Evolution delivers in spades what the first film only hinted at, yet keeping some of the best elements (Beckinsale's acrobatics, car chases and great sets) that set the original tone.The plot is far from simplistic, so here's a reminder of what you need to absorb in the first few minutes in case you miss it or forget to take notes: Vampire heroine Selene (Kate Backinsale), after dedicating most of her life to exterminate Lycans (who she believes slaughtered her family when she was a child), discovers she has been betrayed by her own kind. She teams up with Michael, a Vampire/Lycan hybrid (a human who has become infected with both viral strains). While on the run with her, Michael has to struggle to accept and understand his powers, and he longs to end the war between Lycans and Vampires.Other important characters include: Viktor (Bill Nighy) - a haughty, ostentatious vampire overlord with a very dark side (Selene awoke him prematurely from a long sleep to tell him of a Lycan offensive).Marcus - the last surviving Vampire Elder, a Medieval Warlord. Mutated into a vampire from the bite of a bat. Felt compelled to raise Vampire warriors (such as Viktor) to control the Lycan horde. As he was awoken by the blood of a Lycan scientist ('Singe') however, Marcus has become one of a terrifying new breed.William, brother of Marcus. He mutated into a werewolf (Lycan) from a wolf bite and thence populated the region with the violent Lycan beasts.Alexander Corvinus (Derek Jacobi) is the first immortal, the genetic father of both Lycan and Vampire. The pestilence of the Great Plague of Europe had mutated within him to become the Mother Virus, which eventually became two separate diseases (Vampire and Lycan), as it was passed on to his sons Marcus and William.The film traces the evolution of these characters but you do need to concentrate to get the significance of the heavy battles that are heaped one upon each other. The real question is, what will happen to Selene and Michael? The ending packs an emotional punch and paves the way for even more spectacular (and hopefully bigger budget) episodes. Stay to the end of the credits for some great heavy metal music.Underworld: Evolution offers escapism that explores dark lusts, power, overweening ambition, blind dedication, and the purity of vision to surpass these. Just don't expect Shakespeare.",Underworld - Evolution
61,Fluke_Skywalker,Dull sequel needs a transfusion of fun,5,22 June 2015,"Hey, it's a Hope/Crosby road pic!... but without the humor. I mean *any* humor.The mythology starts to get a bit tangled here, as is usually the case as franchises like these go along. After a while I sorta gave up trying to make sense of what was going on and just went with it (I doubt it really effects your enjoyment--or lack thereof--either way).It's biggest sin is that it's just incredibly dull. Despite moving along at a brisk clip, the action is boring and repetitive and the soapy drama that helped jazz up the original is missing here, making this a rather hollow affair.",Underworld - Evolution
62,sauravjoshi85,A well made sequel,7,15 January 2020,"Underworld: Evolution is the second part of the underworld movie Franchise and is directed by Len Wiseman and stars Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Tony Curran, Derek Jacobi and Steven Mackintosh in the lead roles.There is no doubt that the formula of second part is similar of the first with same violence, bloodshed, demons and vampires but the execution is praiseworthy. Kate Beckinsale is exceptionally good and deserves an applause.The movie is fast paced although goes slow in the middle but comes on track pretty nicely on time. The movie also has a potion of romance and emotion which was missing from it's prequel.The climax of the movie was nicely made and entertaining. Look forward for the next movie.",Underworld - Evolution
63,dwpollar,Fast-paced exciting vampire/werewolf battle...,7,22 January 2006,"1st watched 1/20/2006, 7 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Fast-paced exciting vampire/werewolf battle with Kate Beckinsale doing an excellent job as the vampiress heroine. If you can get thru the gory/bloody details in the fight scenes you will enjoy this adult-oriented adaptation of the video game, part 2. After watching this sequel, I'll probably go back and watch the original to help me fill in the pieces because this movie was definitely harder to follow when you hadn't seen the first. Beckinsale if wonderful in this role and the rest of the cast do a good job in portraying this other-worldly underworld. This is an effects-loaded movie that doesn't let that get in the way. The story is at the forefront despite this, although most of the characters are not completely developed but this may again have to do with not seeing the original. I personally think a television show is forthcoming due to the complexity of the story and what can be explored in this unique setting. I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the story because, #1 - I'll probably get some of it wrong, and #2 - the actions is what sells the movie to me. If your looking for a fun-filled action packed film with a great leading lady who can pull off sweetness & toughness then this movie is for you.",Underworld - Evolution
64,RavenGlamDVDCollector,ghastly hue,8,24 May 2016,"Computer-generated fur and fangs. Not fun to watch. Read something like that. Valid points. Movie looks like it has been filmed inside a freezer. That is the whole point, of course, but that ghastly monochromatic hue affects everything, the world doesn't look like this at all. Thankful!Two things. It's awe-inspiring x1000. There is no denying that. And Kate Beckinsale is amazingly beautiful, the fragile vulnerability of her delicately chiseled face, paired with those ice-blue eyes, offset by the raging tornado inside the character. These two things nobody could argue.The movie suffers from being just as inhuman and cold as its predecessor. As a character, the viewer had no feelings for Selene or Michael. There is no character involvement, they do not make themselves likable, they are coldly distanced from us, we see that they act like heroes, and prefer them to that other horrible lot, of course, but that doesn't make them likable.A third thing to mention, as for 'the king of vampires' in that scene with the truck - learned on the DVD commentary that the scene was considered as something to be thrown out, too expensive for the budget. Glad they didn't, that scene is magnificent!The bleakest magnum opus ever!",Underworld - Evolution
65,kairingler,vampires vs werewolves,6,12 February 2007,"well if i had to compare both underworld movies side by side i would have to take the first one , not that the second one is bad, in no means, just that it's very hard to follow, there's a lot of pre-story to the first, one, lot's of backstory, now i mean some of it's very interestesting i grant you that, but i don 't think the we needed 600 years worth,, but overall this is a very good action movie, with some neat horror niches, in it,, i liked the opening war scene,, some of the castle scenes were very good to excellent,,, kate beckinsale was as always very hot,, and dam she can also act i found out,, i think michael's characters could have been used better this go around, but otherwise it was a nice performance of th time that he was on screen.",Underworld - Evolution
66,Jonny_Numb,should have used Darwin's skeleton as a script consultant...,2,26 June 2006,"Great coogly moogly, I've seen shrink-wrapped hamburger with more brains than ""Underworld: Evolution,"" the not-so-'evolved' sequel to 2003's ""Underworld."" First off, I will put my shame out in the open--I had fun with the original; even if it had a plot devoid of complexity or surprise, it contained enough kinetic camera movements and impressive FX work that I gladly put my brain on the shelf for a lobotomizingly good time. As a meaningful piece of cinema, it was an utter failure, but from a purely aesthetic standpoint it was hard to top (that year, anyway). Now we have ""Evolution,"" whose faults begin with the title (as nary a thing in this sequel shows improvement over the original--or anything else, for that matter), and accumulate like hairs on a werewolf during a full moon. The story this time out is contradictorily simplistic in its telling (a super-duper-mega-hybrid-lycan/vamp crossbreed is looking to rule the earth...or something) and convoluted in its mythology and backstory (neither of which I kept a close eye on)--the original film had a similar structural layout, but was buoyed by what were, at the time, innovative stunts and FX. ""Evolution"" might have been saved in a similar way if its bag of cinematic eye candy didn't reek of 3 years' staleness; the visuals have an utterly uninspired and recycled quality to them (the perpetually dark, mountainous, woodsy world with crumbling castles and CG snow falling so artistically...hang on, Narnia, here we come!), and the swooping camera angles and slo-mo have all become anomalies in the annals of current cinema. With nothing to entice us on a superficial level, we are all but forced to groan at the horrendous dialog scenes (an affront to human ears and intelligence both), though in a moment of shocking creativity, Kate Beckinsale's character uses the word ""qualms."" Add in the timeless cinematic convention of thunder sounding and lightning flashing through windows while characters recite lines intended to be revelatory, and you have the perfect film to fall asleep to on a rainy day, since you certainly won't be riveted or thrilled by anything happening on-screen.",Underworld - Evolution
67,valleyjohn,"Bigger , Bolder and Brasher than the first movie.",7,3 February 2011,"Underworld Evolution is pretty much more of the same of what we saw in the first movie but bigger , better and brasher and i enjoyed this film much more. The special affects are great , as you would expect and the colors are what make this film so watchable. Lots of blue , white and black and on Blue ray this looks outstanding. The storyline is fairly easy to understand and an added bonus is that Steven Mackintosh has a small role which makes up for the fact that Bill Nighy is only in the movie just at the beginning. If there are any minus points , they are that Tony Curran is not as good as Michael Sheen was in the the first film and I'm still not totally convinced about Scott Speedman as Michael. They both lack personality. But never mind because Kate Beckinsale and her PVC makes up for all that !",Underworld - Evolution
68,Samiam3,The story continues (with nothing new),5,11 November 2009,"The thought has been on my mind for months now, but with Underworld Evolution, I've decided to make the following statement an official piece of advice. Labeling a sequel as 'more of the same' is a negative thing, not a positive one. Underworld Evolution, takes a couple of things one step ahead from its predecessor, but with everything else, it takes a huge step in the other direction. Here we see the same fight scene four or five times, and it is shot in a way that may provoke headache.Picking up from where we left off, with Seline and Michael (now a mega hybrid of werewolf) They are still on the run, only this time from a completely different menace. There will be blood for sure.Underworld was both a werewolf and a vampire flick. This one is ten times more of a werewolf movie. Most critics and film scholars have argued that werewolves are unsexy, romantic or glamorous next to vampires, but if you want to make a counter argument, the character of Michael in Underworld evolution is good evidence, (Although suppose Taylor Lautner would be a more popular choice today) All the other wolves in this flick are not so sexy, but they are among the most ferocious that I've seen. They are big and muscular, and move more like grizzly bears, than the long skinny creatures in say the Howling or the more recent Dog Soldiers.Sequels like Underworld Evolution are only for the die hards fans of their predecessors. I liked Underworld, but didn't love it. I will always try a sequel if the first was good enough, but I didn't much care for this one.",Underworld - Evolution
69,davidmvining,The Next Installment,5,10 August 2021,"This feels like the next episode in a serial, picking up right where the previous episode left off to tell just the next adventure in the exciting life and times of Seline, vampire Death Dealer. It's a good thing that I have such affection for the first film because I'm not sure I would have tolerated the rather empty genre exercise that is the second entry in the Underworld series as much as I do. Len Wiseman proved with his sophomore directorial effort that he could manage action scenes well beyond his first effort, and that he provided little more than a strong professional sheen to a script that honestly needed some work. It also becomes tradition that these movies bring in excellent British acting talent to class up the joint far more than it deserves.Seline (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) are on the run immediately after the death of Viktor (Bill Nighy) at Seline's hands. The leadership of the vampire coven now falls to the final of the three vampire elders, Marcus (Tony Curran). Awakened by the blood memories of the man who helped Lucian, the lycan, figure out the bloodlines of Alexander Corvinus (Derek Jacobi), Marcus comes into the world winged, angry, and determined to bring his brother, William, the first of the werewolves, out from his captivity. Freed from operating under the thumb of Viktor who had protected Seline, Marcus needs Seline's blood for her memories on the final resting place of his brother. So begins the chase of the film.Along the sides, monitoring, is Alexander Corvinus, the father of Marcus and William, the first of the vampires and werewolves, who lives on a shipping vessel with a massive spying apparatus to help him keep track of what's going on. He watches as Seline tries to figure out what's going on by visiting an exiled vampire historian (Steven Mackintosh) and Michael learns the thirst inherent to his vampire/lycan state.What's kind of interesting is that Seline and Michael are not the emotional center of this film. If there is one, it's Marcus. Seline and Michael are largely non-entities, there to drive the plot forward with affectation of an emotional journey. They have fallen in love, make love, and worry for each other as they go into and out of danger. Marcus, finally rebelling against the power structure that had kept his brother in chains for literally centuries, finding a new path forward, is actually far more interesting. Played by Tony Curran, he's actually given a shocking amount of pathos, a real benefit of hiring good actors to fulfill roles in even silly movies like this. It's kind of weird that the bad guy gets a more interesting emotional journey than the protagonists, but that's kind of why this movie isn't actually good.Where this movie actually is good is in the same places as its predecessor. The action sequences are really well-filmed, and the acting is far better than the movie deserves. Bill Nighy comes back for a prologue sequence with Marcus, and he chews up the scenery in the way that only he knows how to do, channeling his later performance as Davey Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Derek Jacobi has all of his scenes in one room (he is an old man), and he brings meaning to his part as Corvinus, the man who has let loose upon the world both vampires and lycans, unwilling to end both races because they are led by his own son. Beckinsale shows that she has every right to be an actress instead of just a model by delivering her lines effectively again. Thankfully, Kraven gets murdered in the first full scene, and we are saved from Shane Brolly's acting beyond a few seconds, and those seconds involve him dying horribly. So that's nice.The plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense, mostly because it's not told terribly clearly. It mostly has to do with a chase between Seline and Marcus to get to William first. Marcus wins that race, and we get an extended, well-filmed action sequence as Seline and Michael face off against Marcus and William. Bodies get thrown around, torn apart, and into helicopter blades. It's solid, gory fun.Is this series good? Not really. Do I see the entertainment value of it? Yes, very much. It still manages to take itself too seriously, loving its lore far more than it needs to without a wink to the audience, but the silliness of the film has become too evident to ignore. Either treat the film far less seriously in tone, or treat the story as seriously as the tone you want to use. The movie exists in the middle ground, and it's kind of frustrating. As it stands, the movie's fine, the sort of entertainment that can occupy without really engaging for a couple of hours. Much like the first one.",Underworld - Evolution
