0,TheLittleSongbird,"Kenneth Branagh, I salute you!",10,6 March 2009,"Apart from Roman Polanski's quite disturbing Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing is possibly the best film adaptation of a Shakespeare play I have ever seen. Director Kenneth Branagh managed to make an appealing film, without straying too far from the play. In fact, I think this is his best film as a director.The film itself looked beautiful, from start to finish. From the stunning beginning shots to the beautifully staged end scene, it was a joy. Also the music by Patrick Doyle was outstanding. The song's lyrics, performed by the composer, were actually written by Shakespeare, and the music perfectly matched the action.The casting was ingenious. The scene stealers were Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson(who looked beautiful in this movie)in their characters' love/hate relationship, that was so well-realised. Kate Beckinsale was the picture of innocence, youth and beauty, which reminded me strongly of Mia Sara in Legend. As for Keanu Reeves, I don't care for him particularly, but as you're supposed to hate his character, I actually didn't mind him here. Sterling support also from Richard Briers, Brian Blessed, Denzel Washington (blimey, he looked young) and Michael Keaten.The script was intelligent and funny. As a matter of fact, the script was the best element of the movie. It was also flawlessly expressed by the highly-accomplished ensemble of actors. In conclusion, a wonderful film, that is a must-see if you like Shakespeare. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Much Ado About Nothing
1,SnoopyStyle,fun frolic in Shakespeare,7,14 August 2015,"Don Pedro (Denzel Washington) and his men along with the villainous Don John (Keanu Reeves) visit his friend Leonato. Don John is the prince Don Pedro's bastard half-brother. Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) spars with Leonato's niece Beatrice (Emma Thompson). Young Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) is in love with Leonato's daughter Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and plans to wed. Dogberry (Michael Keaton) is the lead night watch constable. Don Pedro tries to entice Benedick and Beatrice together, and Don John tries to disrupt the wedding. In the end, it's much ado about nothing.Kenneth Branagh has created a fun frolic in Shakespeare. Branagh and Thompson have combative fun. Leonard and Beckinsale are fine as puppy love especially Beckinsale. Washington is solid. The only sour note is played by Keanu Reeves. He is simply not capable of playing the antagonist. Luckily, he's not in the movie that much. The stuffy Shakespeare is given new life in this movie.",Much Ado About Nothing
2,classicsoncall,"""There's a double meaning in that!""",8,27 May 2018,"Reading Shakespeare is nothing like watching Kenneth Branagh direct Shakespeare. He interprets the Bard in a way that commands your attention and allows you to have a good time doing it. I actually first viewed the 2012 version of this movie done as a modern day retelling of Shakespeare's classic comedy, and I have to say, I found this work much more satisfying. It was much grander in scale and the characters came to life in a much livelier fashion. All of the principals did a fine job in their roles, and I'll go out on a limb here by saying that I enjoyed Michael Keaton's Dogberry character the most, just because he brought so much humor and wit to the role. That's not to take away from the romantic elements at the center of the story, as the principal players all turn in marvelously impassioned performances. What I wonder about is how the actors can memorize their lines of Shakespearean dialog and deliver them with such stunning ability and competence. It seems there's not a wasted phrase or moment that doesn't add clarity to the story. This is one Shakespeare inspired film I could watch again and again.",Much Ado About Nothing
3,gavin6942,Branagh's Best Shakespeare?,7,15 April 2015,"Young lovers Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio, soon to wed, conspire to get verbal sparring partners and confirmed singles Benedick and Beatrice to wed as well.Kenneth Branagh has made a name for himself adapting Shakespeare (and other works of classic literature), but this may be his best. Unlike ""Hamlet"" or ""Henry V"", we finally get a nice comedy where the cast does not take themselves any more seriously than they need to. And we have an impressive cast: Denzel Washington (always a smart move), Keanu Reeves (a bold and unusual casting choice), Michael Keaton (coming off his Batman years).While ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is not one of those stories people know as well as the bigger plays, maybe they should... Shakespeare's comedies are far more entertaining than his tragedies and histories. See, for example, ""10 Things I Hate About You"".",Much Ado About Nothing
4,lee_eisenberg,"Well done, even if Keanu Reeves always looks like he's about to say ""dude"".",10,22 November 2005,"Kenneth Branagh perfectly adapted Shakespeare's play about love and deceit in a Messina villa. As Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) are about to get married, they try to get Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) to wed, and at the same time stop despicable Don John (Keanu Reeves) from doing anything nasty. The entire cast is just great, and Michael Keaton is really funny as Dogberry. Denzel Washington may not be someone whom we usually expect to see in an adaptation of a Shakespeare play, but he's quite impressive here as Don Pedro of Aragon. This is one movie that won't disappoint you.",Much Ado About Nothing
5,jboothmillard,Much Ado About Nothing,7,15 March 2007,"I have seen the shortened version of Hamlet, and this second film from the actor/director is a really good comedy drama with plenty to please, e.g. great dialogue, many famous faces and some good giggles. Kenneth Branagh directs, produces, writes (screenplay) and stars in this great film from the play by William Shakespeare. Basically young lovers Hero (Click's Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Dead Poets Society's Robert Sean Leonard) are marrying in a week, and to pass the time, most of the people at the grand place are deceiving bachelors Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) that they love each other. Meanwhile, evil Don John (Keanu Reeves) plans to break up the wedding by accusing Hero of infidelity. In the end, Benedick and Beatrice find out there was never discussions of love, it was ""much ado about nothing"". Also starring Richard Briers as Signor Leonato, Michael Keaton as Dogberry, Denzel Washington as Don Pedro of Aragon, Brian Blessed as Antonio, Imelda Staunton as Margaret and Ben Elton as Verges. The highlights for me are Branagh listening on a conversation, trying to sit on a pop-up chair and making bird sounds when almost caught gasping. Very good!",Much Ado About Nothing
6,Tweekums,A charming Shakespeare Comedy,8,26 October 2017,"As this film opens Leonato and his household await the arrival of Prince Don Pedro and his companions. These include Benedick, the former lover of Leonarto's niece, Beatrice and Count Claudio who is in love with Leonarto's daughter Hero but can't bring himself to tell her. In what follows Don Pedro helps Claudio woo Hero; the various characters try to bring Beatrice and Benedict back together despite the fact that they only bicker and exchange barbs when they talk. Once the two couples are brought together Claudio and Hero are engaged to be married; then the night before Don Pedro's dastardly half-brother, Don Jon, makes Claudio believe that Hero has been unfaithful it would appear that their relationship is dead until her friends and family come up with a ploy to prove her innocence.Actor/Director Kenneth Brannagh has assembled a fine cast for his interpretation of Shakespeare's classic comedy; there are big Hollywood names like Denzel Washington, Keanu Reaves and Michael Keaton and familiar British actors such as Emma Thompson, Richard Briars, Kate Beckinsale and Brian Blessed to name but a few all are on good form and bring the Shakespearian dialogue to life in a way that makes it easy for modern audiences to understand, almost without thinking about it. There a plenty of genuinely funny moments showing that some jokes are timeless. I liked the look of the film with nineteenth century style costumes and setting in an Italian villa. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of watching Shakespeare on the screen.",Much Ado About Nothing
7,blanche-2,Fantastic Shakespeare from Branagh,10,8 October 2009,"Kenneth Branagh assembles an all-star cast with varying expertise at Shakespeare for his marvelous ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" a bright,sexy entertaining 1993 version of the play. The stars are Branagh, Emma Thompson, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton, Denzel Washington, Kate Beckinsale,and Brian Blessed.The plot concerns young lovers Hero and Claudio (Beckinsale and Leonard), due to be married soon, trying to matchmake Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson). However, the evil Don Jon has a plot of his own which will break up the engaged couple by making it look as though Hero has been unfaithful.Youthful and lively, Branagh completely succeeds in bringing ""Much Ado"" to film. There have been complaints about Keanu Reeves, but as he gets a massage and lays on his stomach, bare-chested and wearing tight leather pants, a woman in the audience I was in yelled out, ""Not bad!"" He basically was in it for the sex aspect, and I agree, his performance or lack of it thereof doesn't spoil the film. Most of the rest of the acting ranges from excellent to very good.What makes the film is the exuberance, the sense of fun, the humor, and the fact that it is rousing entertainment. One doesn't usually hear Shakespeare on film described that way. A great achievement by Branagh.",Much Ado About Nothing
8,view_and_review,Different Strokes for Different Folks,4,19 April 2020,I didn't like Shakespeare in high school and I still don't like Shakespeare. Though I will say that it fairs better in a play as opposed to in a movie. I only watched because Denzel Washington was in it.,Much Ado About Nothing
9,neil-476,A joy,10,27 March 2008,"Back in the late 60s, Much Ado About Nothing was one of the Shakespeare plays I studied for A level. The other was Macbeth, and I learned to love them both. I've subsequently seen a couple of versions by the RSC (Janet Suzman and Siobhan Cusack playing Beatrice, I recall), so I came to this film predisposed towards enjoying it. Add to this the glorious look of the piece and the fabulous cast - not just the international headliners, but down to the top-line bit parters (Gerard Horan, Imelda Staunton, Phyllida Law) - and my personal assessment was pretty much guaranteed.So I showed the DVD to my parents. My Dad immediately picked up his crossword (no John Wayne, no Schwarzenegger, no blowing s*** up - not his thing at all). My Mum, who had never encountered Much Ado before, sat enthralled and thought it was a wonderful film.Neither she nor I had any problem at all with Keanu Reeves' performance or Denzel Washington's colour. Keaton's dialogue was, at times, a little impenetrable, but his very funny performance compensated.And I still think that Claudio is as dumb as a plate full of chicken wings.",Much Ado About Nothing
10,Sylviastel,I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Is that not strange?,9,1 December 2005,"I don't know why talented actors like Kenneth Branagh revel in William Shakespeare's works. I am sure there are other writers out there like Ibsen, Chekhov, Pinter, and many others. This film adaptation is a splendid example of bringing American actors like Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton, and Robert Sean Leonard to doing Shakespeare with Kenneth Branagh, Richard Briers, Emma Thompson and her mother Phyllida Law, Kate Beckinsale, Brian Blessed. This film adaptation is quite lovely to look at in the first place. Everybody is happy and alive in Florence, Italy. Phyllida and Emma looked tanned and quite happy there. At the time of the film, Emma and Kenneth were married and supposed to be the heirs to Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier. Sadly like them, they both split up after the movie. I suppose it has to do with Ken and Emma's egos or whatever. At that time, I guess we all wanted them to be madly in love. Two attractive and cerebral people like Ken and Emma get together. It was not meant to be I guess in real life. The film is worthy to watch because it's William Shakespeare being silly, witty, and comical rather than tragic and sad. I have to say Emma's mother, Phyllida Law, has become one of the busiest actresses of her age since the 1990s. She works more than her two daughters combined. I look at her and I can see her own talent. She comes quite alive and happy in this film version. Maybe Phyllida will get an O.B.E. someday before Emma. Believe it or not, Phyllida earned an OBE. indeed for Emma became a Dame and Kenneth became a Knight. I hope so. The cast was first rate. It's one of the more fun Shakespeare plays. The film is first rate with quality and filmed on location in a Tuscan Villa in the summer of 1992.",Much Ado About Nothing
11,SimonJack,Great performances make this the best of the many films,10,26 November 2016,"It's been decades since I've read any Shakespeare, so I don't know how closely this BBC production follows the bard's original. I suspect it's very close, if not exact. This film rendition of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" is by far the best. All the technical aspects are excellent, and the acting and direction are superb. Kenneth Branagh scores a triple hit with his adaptation, direction, and acting (in the part of Benedick). Most of the performers excel. The incomparable Emma Thompson shines as Beatrice, opposite Benedick. Richard Briers is wonderful as Leonato. Denzel Washington does a very good job as the initially magnanimous Don Pedro, then the quiet accuser and withdrawn observer. Robert Leonard plays the part of Claudio near perfectly, opposite Kate Beckinsale's Hero. And, Keanu Reeves is at once disliked for his stark portrayal of the pouting, hateful and envious Don John. All the rest of the cast give top performances. Even then, one smaller but meaty part stands out above all these other wonderful roles. That is Michael Keaton as the chief constable, Dogberry. Keaton steals every scene in which he appears. He gives marvelous life to his hilarious character. I laugh every time I see him in a scene, and even when I think about him at other times – as now. I would love to see Keaton in more Shakespeare comedy. Some people may shy away from Shakespeare because they find the language difficult. I highly recommend this production of ""Much Ado About Nothing."" It's an ideal film to introduce people to Shakespeare. And, I'm sure most will find it easy to follow. This film not only is my favorite rendition of this play, but it's my favorite film of any Shakespearean work.",Much Ado About Nothing
12,JamesHitchcock,A Film about Everything that Makes Life Worth Living,10,21 July 2006,"Prior to ""Much Ado About Nothing"" most memorable cinematic Shakespeare adaptations were based upon his tragedies or histories. Thus we had Olivier's trilogy of ""Henry V"", ""Richard III"" and ""Hamlet"", Welles's ""Othello"" and ""Macbeth"", Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"", Heston's ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (something of a rarity, but still worth seeing) and the Brando/Mason/Gielgud version of ""Julius Caesar"". Shakespeare's comedies were less common in the cinema, probably because so much Shakespearean humour is based either upon puns and wordplay which worked better in Elizabethan English than they do in the modern language or upon topical references to the events of the 1590s and 1600s, lost upon today's audiences. There was that old ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" from the thirties and Derek Jarman's rather eccentric version of ""The Tempest"", but generally the cinema took the view that the comedies were best left to the theatre and television.With his own version of ""Henry V"", well-received by most critics when it came out in 1989, Kenneth Branagh inherited Olivier's role as Britain's leading cinematic Shakespearean. It was perhaps something of a gamble for him to choose a comedy as his second Shakespeare adaptation, but it was a gamble that paid off. The film was shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and in the beautiful, sunlit surrounding countryside. The costumes are vaguely nineteenth-century, but the clear intention was to set the story in a timeless, never-never land, a sort of rustic earthly paradise. (Those claiming supposed anachronisms as goofs, therefore, have rather missed the point. It does not matter whether they had piano-accordions in sixteenth-century Sicily, as this film is obviously not aiming at an accurate recreation of sixteenth-century Sicilian life).Just like the original paradise, this one contains a serpent in the shape of Don John, the evil brother of the Prince of Messina. What is technically the main plot of Shakespeare's play concerns Don John's spiteful machinations to frustrate the marriage of the young soldier Claudio to the beautiful Lady Hero by making false accusations of unchastity against her. I say ""technically"" because this storyline often has to take second place to the sub-plot about the wooing of Beatrice and Benedick. Benedick starts out as a confirmed bachelor and Beatrice an ardent proto-feminist, but (in a plot development which has been copied in thousands of romantic comedies ever since) they end up by falling in love with one another. Their verbal duels were so popular with audiences that at one time the play was better known as ""Beatrice and Benedick"" than by its official title.In the late eighties and early nineties Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thomson (""Ken and Em"") were the golden couple of the British acting profession. Like a number of other golden couples (Larry and Viv, Richard and Liz, Jude and Sadie), their relationship was eventually to end unhappily, but while they were together they were cast opposite one another in a number of productions, and it is they who take on the roles of the feuding pair. Both were practised Shakespearean actors, and they speak their lines with great clarity and simplicity, bringing out all the humour and drama in their parts. Richard Briers is equally good as Leonato, Hero's aged father. Hero herself, despite her central role in the drama, is, on the page, a rather colourless figure, but the lovely Kate Beckinsale, in her first major film role, makes her a delightful and unaffected heroine.Besides a number of leading British stage actors, Branagh also cast several Hollywood stars, doubtless with an eye to the American box office. He was criticised for this in Britain, but in my view, given the unreal, idealised world in which the film is set, the mixture of British and American accents does not matter. Nor does the fact that Messina has a black Duke with a Hawaiian brother, although all of his subjects are white.The most criticised of the American stars seems to have been Keanu Reeves. Although he is perhaps not the greatest speaker of blank verse, I must say in his defence that, psychologically, he seems just right for the role of Don John. Whereas the other characters are full of high spirits and good humour, he is a saturnine figure who seems to radiate gloom and ill-will, a man whose malice arises from his envy of the happiness of others. Of the others, Denzel Washington is appropriately dignified as Don Pedro. Robert Sean Leonard rather struggles with Claudio, but it is a thankless role, a man who is technically the romantic lead but whose jealousy and credulity make him a rather unsympathetic figure. The one actor I did not like was Michael Keaton who over-acts frantically in a weird accent as the drunken constable Dogberry, but even he did not spoil the film for me.A special mention must go to the wonderful theme music by Patrick Doyle, essentially a single theme which is heard, in a number of guises, throughout. (Figure-skating fans like me will always recall this as the music to which Tonya Harding skated at the 1994 Winter Olympics while under suspicion for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan; rumour had it that the choice of music from a film about a woman wrongly accused was a quite deliberate gesture to protest her innocence).This stirring theme fits the mood of the film perfectly. It is a film about love, laughter, happiness, friendship, sunlight and the beauty of nature- in short, a film about everything that makes life worth living. In my view, the greatest-ever film of a Shakespeare comedy. Perhaps the best-ever film of s Shakespeare play. 10/10",Much Ado About Nothing
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A terrific Shakespeare story of love, betrayal and the battle of the sexes",10,28 November 2003,"William Shakespeare, a man ahead of his time who wrote some of the world's most beautiful and wonderful plays. He wrote tragedies, romances, comedies and one of his best comedies/drama that's personally my favorite Much Ado About Nothing. Kenneth Branagh directs another wonderful Shakespeare movie about love, reputation and the battle of the sexes. His chemistry with then wife Emma Thompson was so wonderful that made the movie just a delight. You can't help but smile with Much Ado About Nothing, making you just love life and to remind yourself that sometimes the good guys do win.Don Pedro and his noblemen are visiting their good friend Leonato in Messina after having quashed the uprising led by Don John, the prince's bastard half-brother. Among the victors are Benedick, Leonato's niece, Beatrice, and Benedick's ""sworn brother"" Claudio, a young count. Claudio has been thinking fondly of Leonato's gentle and lovely daughter Hero since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his young friend's feelings, arranges the match at a party. Despite Don John's best efforts to foil it, the Prince's plan works out perfectly in the end. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding day, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick. Of course, both parties being so stubborn to the opposite sex, this match will take a little more ingenuity. The night before the wedding, Borachio arranges to meet with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. John shows Claudio the rendezvous and makes them believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity. He breaks up the wedding and now it's a battle of the sexes and what damage you could do with a woman's reputation.Of course the questionable choice of having Keanu Reeves as Don John, as usual a wooden performance that I'm sure would make Shakespeare cringe. However, there was more than an exceptional choice with having Michael Keaton as Dogberry, he was too funny and exactly who I would picture for the role. Him freaking out because the prisoner kept taunting him and calling him names was just classic, he brings it up later while trying to charge them with lying about Hero got a good chuckle out of me. The thing I absolutely adore about Much Ado About Nothing is that it shows how easily a woman's reputation could be ruined. It's so sad to see how quickly Claudio turns on Hero when he mistakes that she's having an affair. We don't blame him as it was an evil trick but just tragic to watch as he disgraces her in front of everyone and they all look at her with judging eyes including her own father. Brought in with the proper balance of drama and comedy, Kenneth Branagh brought in a great cast and crew to make this play into a wonderful picture. I love Much Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare may not be for everyone, but in my opinion, he's still one of the greatest writers of all time.10/10",Much Ado About Nothing
14,KineticSeoul,A well done adaptation of Shakespeare's work,8,2 September 2013,"This is based on a classic William Shakespeare's play. Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work. There is a high chance you won't be disappointed with this one.8.2/10",Much Ado About Nothing
15,sol-,About Something,7,14 April 2017,"Amused by the contempt they share for one another, the friends of a confirmed bachelor and confirmed spinster conspire to make each believe that the other has romantic designs on him/her in this big screen adaptation of one of William Shakespeare's most popular comedies. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are both excellent as the two cynics turned lovers, sprouting Shakespeare's witty dialogue in a very natural manner and the fast paced banter between them is easily the high point of the film. The plot is more complicated than just that though with a spiteful friend of the couple also conspiring to break up the engagement of his best friend to a woman that he would rather have to himself. This angle is unfortunately far less interesting than everyone tricking Branagh and Thompson into romancing one another and yet the subplot soon gains centre focus. It also does not help that Robert Sean Leonard, who was so great in 'Dead Poets Society', is awkwardly cast here as the man tricked out of his impending marriage, though the actor who seems least comfortable overall here is Keanu Reeves, who looks stunned and dazed half the time. And yet, while the supporting cast varies in effectiveness, Brian Blessed is always great to have on hand, and with both Branagh and Thompson very much in their element, this is a fairly fun film.",Much Ado About Nothing
16,Dr_Coulardeau,Mysterious Shakespeare at his most entertaining,10,27 August 2007,"Shakespeare and his entangled love affairs are as famous as Dracula and his blood cult. But we recognize here the friar who advises a fake death to the girl and we remember that Romeo and Juliet came first in 1596. Shakespeare started with the tragedy around the clandestine marriage of the two heroes, and then moved on to a comedy that sounds at time very tragic, Much Ado About Nothing in 1598, and he doubles the merriment by having two weddings. And he will go on with As You Like It in 1600 and its four marriages under the auspices of the thrice crowned goddess Diana. And this was a model of perfection that he had kept from A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1594. But this present comedy could have been a drama at least if not a tragedy since the death being false, based on a false accusation what's more, could have led to a duel and one real death before being discovered as a fake, and it leads to the arrest of the villain who had arranged the fakery so that a happy love wedding was turned into a dramatic denunciation of the impurity of the bride. That's probably why he doubled the first line of action with a second that reminds us of The Taming of the Shrew (1593) and that second line will lead to the second marriage that will bring everyone, except the plotter, to merriment, gaiety and dancing. But this production is admirable because the setting of the play in a real garden and rich mansion in more or less renaissance clothing though it could be slightly more recent gives to the actors all the space they need to dance, play, hide, run, and many other things. The acting is admirable and they really make the language sing the way it should, sing joy as well as pain, sing sadness as well as happiness. Of course the language is also a little bit difficult but we get used to it very fast and we follow the music of it as well as the words, and the actors were directed into speaking as if they were singing, to the point of even having a failed attempt at real singing that sounds like a cat being disemboweled. And the final but suspended lack of clemency against the guilty plotter is there to remind us that everything may end with songs and dances, but there is always some drama to bring to an end sooner or later, and in that case outside the time limits of the play. But yet I always wonder about what such comedies, or tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, could look like in Shakespearean times when women were not allowed on the stage. So many girls played by teenagers must have been funny, with an echo in the play when Beatrice speaks of men with a beard or men without a beard and the latter are less of a man than she would ever like. That was said by a man without a beard in 1598. I guess we would find it funny and even maybe ridiculous today. But it should be attempted. Shakespeare played on the situation quite often with varying motivations.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Much Ado About Nothing
17,filipemanuelneto,Proof that Shakespeare is as well on screen as on stage.,8,28 August 2017,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" is one of the most notable comedies of Shakespeare's extensive work. His plot is well known, especially from English-speaking audiences (here, in Latin countries, the works of this notable English author have always been less popular), and revolves around an expertly forged slander that separates a couple. The film keeps the essential but it has an aura of lightness and idyll that is good to comedy. Jokes consist of word games with explicit sarcasm. I believe many of the original dialogues have been retained or slightly adapted, as they continue to sound like Shakespeare should sound.The cast has heavy names like Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Robert Sean Leonard and Sir Kenneth Branagh (who also directs and adapts the script). Most of the cast was up to the challenge. Emma Thompson and Branagh deserve both congratulations, as they shone and distinguished themselves by the perfect interpretation of their characters. Denzel was also quite well as the prince, radiating leadership and presence. Personally, I don't appreciate Keanu Reeves, as I have always considered him to be a monotonous and unimpressive actor, but he was right here, in a restrained and sullen character, consistent with his abilities. Kate Beckinsale is a good actress, but the character they gave her doesn't give her more work than to smile and proclaim her love in every possible way. There are a few more underused actors in the cast, but the play does not stretch, does it? I also liked the filming locations, with a genuinely Italian flavor that agrees with everything that is said and done in the film (the play is set in the Sicilian city of Messina). Regarding the costumes and clothes used here, however, I have my doubts. They are fundamental for the temporal framing of the events, and truth is that if the film seems to reproduce the action according to the instructions of the play, and an effort has been made to set it in the correct geographical and cultural context, the temporal framework seems to have been neglected. I cannot say exactly in what historical time the film set the events, but one thing I'm sure: its not the period in which the play puts them. Military uniforms point to the mid-nineteenth century, but if one of the characters is a Prince of Aragon this framing does not make sense, since Aragon no longer existed in the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it's evident the absence of vintage underwear in women's costumes.Staging a Shakespearean text, on stage as on screen, is always a challenge for a director. They are heavy, difficult, detailed texts, with a legion of inveterate supporters who are ready to blindly attack whoever tries to pinch them. But the truth is that, today, cinema has become a kind of ""people's theater"", since theaters themselves are becoming more and more expensive, and dramatic art is becoming more and more elitist. So praise be Sir Kenneth Branagh for helping to keep Shakespeare accessible to the eyes of all people.",Much Ado About Nothing
18,howard.schumann,Full of high spirits,9,3 April 2006,"A prominent theme in the plays of William Shakespeare is that of the ambiguous or unjust accusation of infidelity. Proteus' treatment of Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona, Angelo's of Mariana in Measure for Measure, and Bertram's of Helena in All's Well That Ends Well as just a few examples. It is a pervasive motif as well in Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing, brought to the screen with exuberance in 1993 by Kenneth Branagh. Much Ado is the story of Claudio and Hero's excellent adventure thwarted by Don John, the sullen half brother of Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon. This Branagh adaptation is filled with gorgeous scenery, outstanding costumes, and an all-star cast that includes Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson, Keanu Reeves, Richard Briers, Robert Sean Leonard, Imelda Staunton, and Kate Beckinsale. The film is so full of high spirits that it successfully undercuts the darkness of the theme and renders it much ado about nothing.Set in a 14th-century Tuscan villa in the village of Messina, Sicily at the home of Signor Leonato, the local Governor, the film opens with Leonato (Briers), his niece Beatrice (Thompson) and daughter Hero (Beckinsale) welcoming soldiers returning from battle. Branagh creates a flurry of activity as everyone jumps naked into the pool to bathe in preparation for the occasion. The soldiers are old friends and there is an atmosphere of relaxed joy when they arrive. The returning contingent is led by Don Pedro of Aragon (Washington), Benedick (Branagh), a lord from Padua, Claudio (Leonard), a young lord from Florence, and Don John (Reeves), Pedro's half brother whom he defeated in battle. Upon his arrival, Claudio instantly falls in love with the radiant Hero (Beckinsale) and everyone joyfully prepares for the wedding, with Hero, as was customary for that day, accorded no say whatsoever in the matter.Two courtships take place in the story: Claudio and Hero and Benedick and Beatrice. Shakespeare shifts back and forth between the stories of the two couples, interweaving them into a unified whole. Benedick and Beatrice pretend to dislike each other and exchange verbal thrusts and parries. Beatrice is exuberant, tantalizing, and full of wit, remarkably portrayed by the great Emma Thompson while Branagh, a confirmed bachelor, has a boyish charm and a keen intelligence. In spite of his outward disdain for Beatrice, Benedick inwardly burns with love for her and there is strong chemistry between the two (they were husband and wife at the time). It is interesting to note the similarities between Beatrice of Much Ado, Rosaline of Love's Labour's Lost, and Rosalind of As You Like It. All are witty, sharp-tongued women, reminiscent of the fiery Anne Vasavour, a woman of the court who was the lover of the Earl of Oxford and whose courtship offended the Queen and landed Oxford in the tower.As everyone looks forward to the wedding, the jealous Don John and his associate Borachio launch a scheme involving Hero's attendant Margaret (Imelda Staunton) to convince the susceptible Claudio that Hero was unfaithful to him on his wedding night. Rather than confronting Hero immediately, Claudio, supported by Don Pedro, cruelly waits for the wedding at which he interrupts the ceremony with a verbal tirade against his bride to be. He tells Leonato, ''Give not this rotten orange to your friend. . . . She knows the heat of a luxurious bed''. Her father, Leonato, takes Claudio at his word, believing Hero is a whore and despicably says that he would prefer his daughter were dead. The wedding scene causes Hero to faint and Benedick to challenge Claudio to a duel at the behest of Beatrice. To teach Claudio a lesson, Hero goes into hiding and everyone pretends that she has died.The theme of wrongful accusation of infidelity is a reminder of the cruel treatment by Oxford of his wife Anne, whom he also wrongly accused of infidelity and who was destroyed by his disbelief in her loyalty. If the play does represent a defense of his behavior, however, it is unconvincing as the accuser shows no remorse and never apologizes for his wanton behavior. As Benedick and Beatrice are manipulated by overheard conversations into believing the other is madly in love with them, Don John's scheme to thwart the marriage is uncovered by the dimwitted Constable Dogberry (Michael Keaton) and the play proceeds in typical Shakespearean fashion with justice and all good things prevailing. Much Ado About Nothing is rousing entertainment that cannot help but leave you in an upbeat mood.",Much Ado About Nothing
19,ianlouisiana,"With one bound,Mr Branagh is free....................",10,16 September 2008,"It is perfectly acceptable to tinker with the production of a Shakespearian comedy.If Mr Branagh had wanted Dogberry to have a large rubber duck on his head and wear frogman's flippers that is his prerogative.If Mr Keaton wants to play the part like an spaced out L.A. Tweaker that is his prerogative .Back in the 1950s we had a school production of ""A comedy of errors"" where a skiffle group played onstage and all the cast danced to Bill Haley's ""Rock around the clock"" in the last scene.The world didn't end. This wonderfully light and wonderfully lit production of ""Much ado"" is a triumph,and an especial triumph for director/actor Mr Branagh who has been accused of taking himself much too seriously.In this movie he takes the text seriously but displays a previously unsuspected touch for slight self - mockery as Benedict who finds himself unaccountably falling in love against his will with Miss E.Thompson.She is pretty and witty and gay as Beatrice who matches him verbal thrust for verbal thrust,extracting the most from the crackling dialogue.A 16th century Germaine Greer without the dour feminist partyspeak. She is,quite simply,magnificent,and when Benedict jumps into the fountain out of the sheer joy of being with her,he transmits the heady,reckless, dangerous exhilaration of new love to the audience. With this production Mr Branagh has moved out from under the shadow of Laurence Olivier,a pall that has hung over him since ""Henry V"",a fine movie in it's own right,but not perhaps the wisest choice for a young man wanting to make something his own. Here is a movie with the crackling energy and optimism of youth.And with one bound,Mr Branagh is free.",Much Ado About Nothing
20,Coxer99,Much Ado About Nothing,9,25 March 1999,"With exception to the idiotic casting of Keanu Reeves, this is a perfect film version the classic Shakespeare romantic comedy. Branaugh and Thompson are perfectly paired as arrogant jesters who find themselves in a game of matchmaking, compliments of Denzel Washington, Richard Briers and Robert Sean Leonard. The highlight of the film is the bawdy performance from an unlikely performer in a Shakespeare film in Michael Keaton. Keaton is energetic and lively in his performance of the befuddled Dogberry. Branaugh also directed this lavish adaptation that was nominated for a Golden Globe.",Much Ado About Nothing
21,runamokprods,"Uneven, but terrific at it's best",7,5 September 2014,"Not my favorite Shakespeare play, lacking the rich, playful complexities of some of the Bard's other comedies, I've always felt on a pure plot level this feels more simplistic, ill-logical and forced than most of the works by the greatest writer in the English language.That said, Branagh's adaptation has some sensational elements. The best of all is the relationship between Branagh and Emma Thompson (then married in real life) as Benedick and Beatrice. As they showed in their brief time together in Branagh's ""Henry V"" the two are both magnificent at making Shakespeare feel human, spontaneous, modern and above all fun. Both create terrific characters – two bull headed intellectual wits who obviously belong together, but who managing to use their words and wit to keep tripping themselves up, like some Shakespearian version of the best of Tracy and Hepburn. The star studded cast all do good work, although the much lesser known Richard Biers is perhaps the most wonderful in his simple, warm human reality as Leonato. The film looks great, filmed on an estate in Tuscany with beautiful grounds and that Tuscan light forming a backdrop too our story. But, in the end, the play's the thing, and much of the other character's stories. well acted as they are, feel too melodramatic and heavy handed for the fun, light feel of the film (Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckensale both do excellent work as Claudio and Hero, but their storyline's over-dramatic swings are hard to overcome). The score also feels over-the-top, especially in the more dramatic sections, which in turn adds to the feeling that there's something too uneven in the tone. The comedy (e.g. Michael Keaton's very weird but entertaining Dogberry), is so broad, that it's hard to put it in the same film with the over- sober tone of the story of the young lovers. None-the-less there's a lot to like if one overlooks some unevenness in both story and presentation.",Much Ado About Nothing
22,Agent10,A fun and inspiring film,9,14 May 2002,"While Kenneth Branagh has made a career out of making Shakespearean film, he creates a true masterpiece, despite the mainstream tendencies that are littered throughout the film. Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton and Keanu Reeves give the film a visual perspective unlike any other Shakespearean film I've seen. It was a welcome relief to see these two instead of just a bunch of stuffy British actors. A great film to watch, one that was both understandable, yet high brow enough to give art film lovers a show.",Much Ado About Nothing
23,Spleen,Shakespeare at his most exhilarating,10,17 August 1999,"Be honest: does the idea of a Shakespearean joke make your heart sink a little?  Do you think of obscure, lowbrow Elizabethan humour that MAYBE someone was kind enough to explain in a footnote?Certainly the comedies are harder to stage, but when they're well done ... One of the most exhilarating things about Shakespeare is the certain knowledge that no character will ever express himself poorly.  Well, characters like Dogberry do, in a sort of a way, but that's deliberately done for comic effect and doesn't count.  No character is ever thwarted by a lack of expressive power.  Whenever Benedick must plead his case, you know that he will summon up all the eloquence he needs; and whenever Beatrice insults anyone, you know that she will summon up all the venom and wit SHE needs.  In some ways it's easier to appreciate this in a comedy when the plot is, reduced to its essence, much ado about nothing.No film director working today can approach Branagh when it comes to presenting Shakespeare cleanly and clearly, in a way that lets us participate in this verbal delight.  This particular film is actually funny, as well as verbally delightful.  It's also visually delightful - it has an attractive cast (Kate Beckinsale plays one of Shakespeare's ciphers but makes us understand why people fell in love with her), a sunny Tuscan landscape and a long tracking shot at the end that has to be seen to be believed.  Performances are all good (other comments here have convinced me that even Keanu Reeves fits into his role).  Comedy or not, this is the best Shakespeare film in years and is a candidate for being the best of all time.",Much Ado About Nothing

25,intelearts,Romantic comedy at its best...,10,15 January 2008,"If you've ever wondered where genres came from look no further than Shakespeare and he'll look no further back the Greeks.This is one for those who love romantic comedies. It is so full of joy, energy, and fun that it leaps off the screen at the viewer. Ken Brannagh does a brilliant job at making the lines clear and beautiful and really anyone can enjoy this, if you just let yourself get lost in it. An outstanding cast - the only misjudged role for me was British comedian Ben Elton as Verges, a character I never liked anyway, (I wished they had used Tony Robinson from Blackadder in his stead) otherwise the cast was excellent: especially Richard Briers who I wish along with Felicity Kendall had had a chance to do more film. What comes across from this is just the sheer enjoyment at putting Shakespeare on film; it really is a good film, well shot, very well though through, and lovingly done.Whether you love Shakespeare or sat and slept during English Lit this is a fine production that will be watched over and over again. It stands as one of the very best adaptations on screen of the Bard's work, and can be enjoyed just for what it is: a really entertaining and good film.",Much Ado About Nothing
26,brchthethird,Charming and effervescent Shakespeare adaptation,9,14 November 2014,"Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Shakespeare's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is nothing short of astounding. With one exception, every cast member brought their A-game, resulting in a movie that is overflowing with emotion and humor. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson play Benedick and Beatrice, Denzel Washington plays Don Pedro and Michael Keaton does an excellently weird interpretation of Dogberry. The only downside is that Keanu Reeves is stuck in the thankless role of Don John, but fortunately the role isn't that substantial. Other aspects of the movie are just as impressive, from the on-location shooting in Tuscany to the score and a few beautiful songs. Shakespeare has rarely been so fun! A must-see for Shakespeare fans and people who like romantic comedies.",Much Ado About Nothing
27,sarastro7,Best Shakespeare film ever,10,29 December 2003,"Unlike some people, I'm not letting Keanu Reeves' ""acting"" ruin this film for me. He has such a small part, and I'm sure Branagh was fully aware of what he was doing when he cast wooden Reeves to play a wooden role. Reeves is indeed the one substandard thing about this film, but even so, it somehow works (Reeves' role, I mean). This film is about rapt joy and ebullient vitality, and Reeves' flatness creates precisely the contrast that makes his character stand out as totally unfit for the world presented in the film, just as the beginning of Richard III establishes Richard as unfit for *his* times (only, he had enough cunning and opportunity to really foul things up!). There is no mistake, neither on the Bard's nor Branagh's part, in casting Reeves as Don John.Having gotten that out of the way, I'd just like to say that this is my favorite Shakespeare film ever. It is perfect in virtually every way, and I think Branagh displays a marvelous and rare understanding of the textual material. This is an immortal classic that I've seen a dozen times and that I am certain I will continue to watch on a regular basis for the rest of my life.10 out of 10.",Much Ado About Nothing
28,KnightsofNi11,Branagh excellently supports an already excellent Shakespearian story,7,24 November 2010,"Whether you enjoy it or not, it is a solid fact that William Shakespeare was one of the best, if not the best, writer of all time. His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a ""love trap"" for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it.When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly.As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience.Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.",Much Ado About Nothing

31,perfectbond,Very enjoyable film,8,1 November 2003,Much Ado About Nothing was one of the plays we didn't cover in my Shakespeare class so I wasn't familiar with the text when I watched it. I enjoyed the story and performances of the all-star cast who were no doubt helped by the fact that their lines was taken from the work of one of the true masters of the language. This isn't one of my favorites of Shakespeare's works but anything by the master is thoroughly worthwhile so I still offer my strong recommendation. Branagh is to be commended for being so passionate about bringing this material to mainstream audiences who might otherwise never be exposed to it. 8/10,Much Ado About Nothing
32,HelenMary,one of the most joyous and uplifting films of all time,8,4 August 2013,"One of Shakespeare's greatest romantic comedies, adapted and Directed by one of Shakespeare's greatest aficionados, Mr Kenneth Branagh, this film is brilliant. The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily.The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, ""Would you have me, lady?"" or all the men coming riding over the hill...Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances. Laugh out loud humour, great musical score (the song ""Pardon Goddess of the Night"" is stunning) and flawless direction.

33,rollernerd,"Hello Nonny, Nonny",7,19 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! Queue in intro music**Good morrow to you fine maidens and sirs, the present day's movie review is thou Shakespeare's play movie adaption Much Ado About Nothing (1993) directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring an ensemble cast including Branagh, Emma Thomson, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton and my man Denzel Washington. The movie set in Tuscany starts with a village filled with laughter and joyful merrymakers and are excited (in particular the ladies) when they soon find out that Don Pedro, the Prince of Aragon played by Denzel is returning from a victorious battle and is accompanied with his followers and his devious half-brother Don John played by Reeves. Denzel plays as the match makers and with his help two young set of lovers fall for each and decide to wed the next day. Another set of counterparts are content with their single lives until they fall for each other with the help of trickery from their friends including Don Pedro. The villain Don John notices the happiness among his fellow men and the villagers and decides to scheme and destroy the love between the two younger lovers. Through misunderstandings and deception he brings his villainous plan to fruition by convincing that the younger female lover, Hero, is an unfaithful woman thus ruining her honour.It took me awhile to get into this film due to a series of picnics, communal bathing, weird courtships and the scene with the entourage's galloping arrival which feels like a scene from The Magnificent Seven is pretty dramatic however once you get over these scenes, overall not a bad story. Also the ""Hello Nonny, Nonny"" scene, no idea what it means but Thompson doesn't look crazy when she utters those words. Whats even better is her insults, banter and verbal berates are funny enough to make the film flowing and this probably credited to Branagh who uses the same materials and the Shakespeare language and gives its own witty and cheerful creation.From Denzels charming portrayal of the Prince who seeks rightfulness to the people he cares and promotes his comrades' happiness to Keaton's portrayal of the inarticulate comic constable Dogberry reminds of Beetlejuice created for this play which gets points from me especially when he learns the truth behind the scheme. Overall, great performances by all and you can tell that the love for this material was shared among all the cast and was easily watchable and understandable for a newcomer like myself, 7/10.",Much Ado About Nothing

Denzel Washington really is enjoying being in a Shakespeare-movie, and Branagh is very, very entertaining. I love this movie.                               My Rating: 8.5/10",Much Ado About Nothing
35,ferdinand1932,A lesson in overacting,1,29 September 2012,"Having seen this film when it was released and having disliked it at the time, then watched it again recently, disliked it even more.The worst defect is the overacting. Emma Thompson is perfectly dreadful as she overdoes it in every scene she has; but the rest of the cast also overact, their facial expressions animated like some cartoon. They all mug to camera except Washington but his part is semi-regal. The less said about Michael Keaton's performance the better - it is comically rank. His accent is a bogus Irish stevedore stuck in Tuscany.The other annoying feature is the glued on grins and smiles as if this is a Carry On film. If only Sid James had appeared to add some class. And finally the music is a sticky overbearing aural goop that lacks nuance. Film music and Shakespeare are not good companions and in this case, to quote, 'The Tempest', ""misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.""The play is one of Shakespeare's very best. It is the very first romantic comedy with ill-matched lovers who find love, but none of that brilliant sparring battle between Benedick and Beatrice is here.",Much Ado About Nothing

He was charming! But he's a great actor, so I'm not too surprised. All the characters in this movie have Shakespeare-like plays' incredible mannerisms.

'Much Ado' has a bright cheery feel that is never too much and the actors deliver on that. With the length of a movie its only major hindrance, Branagh has stood out with a good adaptation for the silver screen.Don Pedro returns victorious with his crew to Messina. Love is in the air for some of his men and the town's ladies.'Much Ado' has some of the most exceptional chemistry ever seen in movies. Wit is swung so dangerously, yet fluently that you would wonder how any non-Shakespearean fan would keep up. You have to give credit where it's due in seeing the blend of North American and British talent mesh with the play. It's a fantastic, bright story and, with the exception of a questionable soundtrack and length, is an overall good show.",Much Ado About Nothing
38,joestank15,"Not perfect, but a good film and a great way to start the kids on Shakespeare.",8,14 November 2005,"about 5 years ago, my first experience with Shakespeare was reading Romeo and Juliet in class. Then I saw the 70s film and the Leonardo Dicaprio film. And man oh man I wish my time with Shakespeare had started with this movie.Kenneth Branagh is priceless in his performance as Benedick, showing a true knack for comedy and establishing himself as one of the modern greats as Shakespeare. Emma Thompson delivers a cheeky and shrewd, yet caring performance as Beatrice. Micheal Keaton is pure genius with his slightly drunkard, slightly mad portrayal of Dogberry that pretty much sets the bar for funniest performance in a Shakespeare ever. Robert Sean Leonard plays a lovable and genuine pretty boy that is so uncertain of his good luck with the lady Hero that he looks for any excuse given to reject her.And here are the two follies of the movie. This has probably been said before, but whoever told Keanu Reeves that he should do Shakespeare, and a villain, no less, needs to meet bundles up in a bag of quick dry cement and sent down the river. He's just terrible. Don John is not Richard the Third. He's not Iago. He's not evil incarnate. He should not try to emanate the kind of wickedness he doe. It's bad enough that Keanu tries to give the villain a caliber that is not appropriate, but the fact that he does it so badly. He doesn't clarify most of lines, but we know they're evil because he glares during it all. The most genuine line of his (thankfully reduced) number of lines is ""I thank you. I am not of many words but I thank you."" His performance is a good example of what future Don Johns (like myself) ought not to do.And the second problem is the serious miscasting of Denzel Warshington as Don Pedro. He was like Mr. Rogers through the whole play. Whether he got rejected, discovered his brother was a villain, he'd bounce back up like it was Christmas day. No one should be that happy go lucky. Did he have a Valium before each take? Never mind that he's black (although it does raise some simple logical questions, such as how Hero could've ever fallen for him pretending to be Claudio. Half brothers indeed.It's a slightly mixed bag, but the odds are in favor of the movie.

Emma Thompson as Beatrice is a perfect match for him,creating an equally witty,yet feminine sparring partner and eventual lover. Kate Beckinsale in her screen debut is outstanding,bringing some guts to the pretty ingenue,Hero.Richard Briers is a welcome addition to any film and here he is charming,fun and solid. Only Michael Keaton (in a role that he could have excelled in had he been directed differently) and the bland Keanu Reeves as Don John, mar this perfect cast. I have been involved in 2 productions of ""Much Ado"" (once as Don John) so I disagree with those who say that Reeves way was the only way of portraying the villian.His performance lacks any fire,fun, or energy.No venom!

42,tonstant viewer,Never Tell An English Actor He's In A Comedy,6,1 July 2007,"I liked this picture a lot when I saw it in first release. Coming back to it now, it has rotted in the can.I've just spent a few months watching the entire 37-play BBC Shakespeare cycle on DVD, and have seen a great many different ways of acting this kind of material. Congratulations here go to Emma Thompson, who is wonderfully true and real all the way through this film. Richard Briers and Denzel Washington also do fine jobs.It goes downhill from there. The negative reviews of Keanu Reeves are earned: he struggles with the language, and never once sounds like the words he speaks convey anything from inside. They're laminated to his lips and emerge with difficulty. And Robert Sean Leonard is too darn wet for Claudio. It's impossible to believe that he has ever drawn a sword, let alone been in battle.Worst of all, Kenneth Branagh is cluttered, calculating and unspontaneous, and is an atrocious director of comedy. It's like he directs the first half of the play from an instruction book for those who have no humor but would like to learn, and makes sure the characters laugh too heartily at each other to cue the audience that it's all supposed to be funny. There is tiptoe-ing around among hedges, struggling with a balky lawn chair and splashing around in a fountain, and it's all dreary and inept. There is entirely too much exaggeration in the facial and vocal performances overall, and Michael Keaton and Ben Elton are grotesque without ever being entertaining as the clowns.Only with the catastrophic wedding scene does the film come to life, and from then on misses much of the power of the play. But at least they're not making those awful faces any more.It's like a bus load of English actors (with a few Americans thrown in) is let loose in a rented Italian villa to play charades. There's little that's honest and nothing organic about this whole project.Fortunately, the BBC studio version with Robert Lindsay and Cherie Lunghi is far more successful at the lights and shadows of the play, with less star power and no location shooting, but far more justice to Shakespeare's genius. That version is highly recommended, but not this one.",Much Ado About Nothing
43,colonel_green,It's terrible and Kenneth and Emma couldn't have worked out their differences.,8,21 July 2005,"It's often said that offscreen couples rarely work well together on screen. For negative examples, look no further than Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Great screen couples like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall appear once in a blue moon. One such couple was Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, who starred together in such films as ""Henry V"", ""Dead Again"", and ""Much Ado About Nothing"".It's often difficult to match Shakespeare's classic 16th century comedies with 20th century sensibilities, but Branagh pulls it off here. The only way to make this material funny to audiences is to take it way over the top, and that's where we go. Branagh, Thompson, and an eclectic cast of Americans and RSC regulars ham it up delightfully. Several Branagh regulars are on hand, such as Richard Briers, Jimmy Yuill, and Brian Blessed. Denzel Washington and Robert Sean Leonard acquit themselves well, while Keanu Reeves is somewhat one-note (but then, so is his character); Michael Keaton's bizarre Dogberry is difficult to judge. Kenneth and Emma are the real stars of this production, however, and they both shine.The film, shot in the Italian countryside, looks gorgeous, with wonderful sets and costumes, and the cinematography to show them off properly.This is a quality production, and it gives me hope that Branagh's film adaptation of ""As You Like It"" (with Blessed and Yuill returning) will be similarly successful. I give ""Much Ado About Nothing"" an 8/10.",Much Ado About Nothing
44,copperncherrio,"Pleasantly entertaining, due to amusing cast choice",5,13 March 2011,"Soooo This is a great movie. Mainly just due to the cast, more so the outstanding cast doing Shakespeare: Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Kate Beckinsale, Emma Thompson, Michael Keaton (essentially playing Beetle Juice all over again in Shakespeare)...Denzel is actually really good in Shakespeare so is Emma Thompson (obviously). But that's not what makes this movie great. It's freaking Keanu and Robert Sean Leonard (aka Wilson from House). Robert is actually pretty great. But it's so funny watching Wilson rattling off Shakespeare with such passion, trotting along side Denzel and Keanu in great outfit. And also shoving down Kate Beckinsale.Also Keanu chuckling manically but really poorly is great. Just look at the movie poster and one could completely understand.It's essentially Shakespeare made movies at its best.

For my money, this is the best of his Bardic movies, less weighty than Henry V and simply better-played than Love's Labours Lost.  He gives a masterclass in how to speak the language while being understood, and ropes in British thesps and US superstars to do the same.  There are bum notes - Neo is no Shakespearean actor, and quite what Michael Keaton is up to is debatable - but it's thoroughly enjoyable.",Much Ado About Nothing
46,Skeletors_Hood,Truly Wonderful! A great movie!,10,9 November 2001,"Brilliant!  Kenneth Branagh's version of the timeless William Shakespeare classic is a great rendition of the film, making it accessible to everyone, even those who do not like Shakespeare.Let me first say that I am a great fan of Shakespeare's works.  In college I was an English literature major, with a minor in theater, and so Shakespeare is found in both.  Theater people state that Shakespeare was never literature at all, which in the purpose of the plays is true, however because of the prose that he wrote in is a poetic form, he is literature as well.  Whatever you do, never get in between two people arguing this point, your head might blow up!Reading the comments on this page, the basic attack on this movie is that Branagh cuts lines and shaved parts.  Yes, of course he did.  Nothing is sacred, not even the works of Shakespeare, people.  I myself was in a Shakespeare play, and over half the script was cut from it.  With a Shakespeare play, the question is what to cut.  If this play had been presented in it's entirety, it would have been close to five hours long. And today's movie audience just does not have that kind of patience.  ""Titanic"" was stretching it a little, in terms of time.  Shakespeare's original audience would have had no problem, because they made a day of it.So when Branagh did this play, he had to shave off a great deal of the script, and he had to decide what to focus on.  He had to focus on the main characters, being Beatrice and Benedict and their romance, and of course the drama concerning Hero and Claudio, but also keep other characters incorporated as well.  For those attacking the ""whittling down"" of the script, why didn't anyone bring up the point that Benedict is supposed to have shaved his beard while in attempt to woo Beatrice.  Why?  Because it really isn't a major plot point that is needed at all.  So Branagh made great choices in his direction of the film, and in the end he made sure that everything tied together logically, and that there were no loose ends.The performances by the actors were great as well.  There was nothing wrong with casting Denzel Washington as the prince, though people seem to have a beef with it.  He pulled it off very well.  And Keanu Reeves did a great job as well.  It was a treat to see him as a villain.  I happen to be a fan of Reeves, and I do see him as great casting, though why people also have a problem with him I'll never know.  Branagh was going for acting ability, not just names.  Reeves has the goods, and he can speak Shakespeare very well, it's his character that's supposed to be moody.  And Keaton was a wonderful choice for the Constable, making me laugh whenever he was on the screen. And the other actors all did very well in their roles.If you're a lover of Shakespeare or not, this film is a great treat, and it appeals to all audiences who love the classic masterpiece.",Much Ado About Nothing
47,carflo,Excellent production,10,14 October 2003,"This was an excellent production of Much Ado, my favorite Shakespeare comedy. Beatrice and Benedick have been my favorite Shakespearean lovers ever since I saw the 1973 Joseph Papp production starring Sam Waterston, in his pre-Jack McCoy days, as Benedick. I would like to recommend this version of Much Ado to any Bard novice who is interested in Shakespeare. It is one of the most accessible Shakespearean movies I have ever seen. Kenneth Branagh obviously worked very hard to make the dialog understandable to modern viewers. Branagh is always good in Shakespeare and Emma Thompson is delightfully spirited as Beatrice. It was filmed at a villa in Italy and it is as much a treat for the eye as it is for the ear. It would have been a perfect production if it had not been for Michael Keaton as Dogberry. He tried to use some strange accent and I couldn't understand a word he said. Too bad, because Dogberry has some very funny lines.",Much Ado About Nothing
48,joliefille411,Be ye Blithe and Bonny,9,24 August 2007,"Kenneth Branagh is one of the most powerful filmmakers out there when he is in his element. Much Ado makes that extremely clear. Here, Shakespeare leaves the dusty pages for a golden romp in the sunny Tuscan countryside.The story is exactly what it seems; a big to-do over nothing. Soldiers returning from war are hungry for love. Each believes he is climbing a mountain of obstacles to obtain said love, when in reality they had nothing to worry about the whole time. In many ways this is a parody of real romance; thinking the simplest things are the end of the world.The acting is mixed between superb and mediocre. Hero (Beckinsale) was flat. She only ever did what she was told, whether it was ""say this"" or ""fall in love with this fellow"". She may not have had much to work with in the script, but there are plenty of ways to convey emotion without words. My problem with Claudio (Leonard) was not the acting but the character itself. He was seriously daft, believing everything he was told and then going ballistic. Even had Hero been unfaithful, to expose her in such a cruel fashion was completely unnecessary. I would have had a much harder time taking him back. Two standouts were of course, Beatrice (Thompson) and Benedick (Branagh). Each shows their command of Shakespearean language to the fullest extent, making every scene they are in come alive. Don Pedro (Washington) does what he does well enough. I never see him outside that certain benevolent hero role. Lots of people bash Keanu Reaves for his role as the villain and I can definitely see why, but I think that a flat, OTT performance suits the character. He even explicitly states that he cannot hide the fact that he is a ""plain-dealing villain"". Dogberry (Keaton) was always a little hard for me to understand, however his ridiculous antics helped smooth-over the difficult parts.The cinematography is quite beautiful, and the very last scene is especially well done. Overall, it is a lovely film about the follies of love.",Much Ado About Nothing
49,abum190,I love Kenneth Branagh,8,14 April 2006,"Before this movie, I had never really known much of him. I saw him in the 2nd Harry Potter movie, and liked him as Lockhart. I knew of his fancy for making Shakespeare movies, but, honestly, had always scoffed at the idea of Shakespeare on film. And now, with this fun-loving movie, I have to say that I scoffed wrongly.Shakespeare's plays are somewhat confusing to the average American because we don't speak his language. While his work was probably very well-liked and popular in his time, people tend to shy away from it now, simply because they can't understand it completely. The truth is, it's really better to view one of his plays after you've studied it and can follow the action better. Because I had never read Much Ado About Nothing before, I found it a little hard to follow at the beginning, but Kenneth Branagh films so directly and his cast is so brilliant, that I picked up the pace and direction of the plot in no time.I say the cast is brilliant because only a brilliant cast could make Shakespeare's words sound natural. I've read somewhere that Laurence Olivier was a master at making Shakespeare roll off of his tongue- well, now we can add Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson to that elite list. They have so much fun in creating characters that hate marriage and the opposite sex, that it came to the point where I would start chuckling before one of them even said anything in anticipation of what they were going to say- everything they did was funny, so naturally I expected the next thing they did to be funny. Denzel Washington and Robert Sean Leonard are also very good, but not really given the chance to shine as much as Branagh and Thompson- that is, except in the scene where Washington and Sean Leonard conspire to mislead Branagh's character into believing that Thompson's loves him, the best scene in the movie. Keanu Reeves, who would probably seem better in a lesser cast, only manages to seem forced in everything he does as the villain.As for the other aspects of the film, I must say that the art direction is beautiful and that Kenneth Branagh is a wonderful director. There are spots in the film where Branagh makes ""much ado about nothing"" with the cinematography, but I'm afraid the joke is probably lost on a lot of the people who watch this- I only noticed it because my sister pointed it out to me.And as for the story, all I can say is that it's classic Shakespeare comedy. And, I suppose, that's not really a genre up for mass marketing. This movie won't be for everyone, but for those of you willing to watch Shakespeare and enjoy it, this is a gem.",Much Ado About Nothing
50,shattenjager777,The easiest Shakespeare makes the easiest movie.,10,9 May 2003,"Much Ado About Nothing is one of Shakespeare's easiest plays to understand and follow and thus it is only sensible to make that play available to the public.  Its lighthearted humor is easy to understand and made even more so by some brilliant comic performances in this film.  In fact, the casting in this film is nearly perfect.  I would only disagree somewhat with three of them:  Denzel Washington, Robert Sean Leonard and Keanu Reeves.  Reeves's part is small enough and insignificant enough that Branagh got away with casting a big name who couldn't act, but Washington's part is just big enough to require a capable Shakespearian actor and he is apparently not quite there.  Meanwhile, Leonard seems to want to be a Shakesperian actor, but overplays his role to the extent as to be against what I believe is necessary (though it did add to the film's humor and thus may have been called for by director Branagh).  I love Denzel Washington, but here he just doesn't quite seem to fit his role.  The best performances are, as can be expected, from Michael Keaton, Kenneth Branagh, and Emma Thompson. Thompson's portrayal is spot-on and Branagh manages to handle the subtlties of humor to the point where he appears Robin Williams-like, but the true genius is Keaton.  Keaton's character is given physical humor that could not have been written in the play and Keaton performs it perfectly.Overall, Branagh presents a beautiful setting, brilliant casting, a perfect adaptation of a brilliant piece of literature, excellent music, and some lighthearted original comedy (such as the folding chair Branagh has in the garden scene) as his film.  Therefore, it is a very brilliant and successful work for a reason.",Much Ado About Nothing

Now I can't seem to get enough of it. I fell in love with the movie all over again. This time for other reasons like the plot and humor of it. The acting is superb by all. My favorite is no longer Claudio but Bennedick and then Beatrice. I think they had the most chemistry between them. It helps that the actors were married to each other at the time.

This is one of Shakespeare's lesser plays, pure fun, romance, and comedy, and Branagh captures that spirit.  I loved the sun-drenched look of this film, the way the Benedick/Beatrice scenes worked, and the never less than excellent Emma Thompson.  The supporting cast - Denzel Washington in particular - was also mostly admirable.  I even enjoyed the rough comedy of the Michael Keaton led watch.But to me there were two things that stood out badly here: a few of the sillier scenes of Benedick and Beatrice splashing in ponds, swinging on a rope, all set to swelling, overly romantic music.  And Keanu Reaves. Granted, the darker aspects of this play are plot contrivances to keep the romance moving, but that does not excuse a one note, emotionless, flat affect performance.

The editing and shot choices could have been better since there were long shots or many back and forth shots which made this film like a play full of talking more than a film, but that wasn't the main problem. I think I blame the source material and its adaptation in that it still feels too much like a play that makes its people laugh in springtime as if to remind us how happy we are supposed to be, but as a film it really drags - and when you watch the final wedding scene, you'll keep waiting and waiting for it to end (hence my gooey and annoying comment).I would recommend this film if you have trouble understanding the play since it is a confusing one, but if you are going to see it performed, why not watch a play? The live medium seems better suited for this piece than it does film. Good for a watch once I guess but then you'll realize all that effort put into the film was much ado about nothing.

I can just imagine Ken sitting around his kitchen table with his casting director saying ""okay we have this brilliant ensemble cast, the movie is going to be great, what can we do to completely screw it up? I know let's cast Keanu Reeves as Don John and completely snarl up the whole thing"" Personally I think Keanu made a great villain, and I trust Ken's ability in casting to choose the perfect actor for the part.  I do not think that in reality that Ken would cast someone so hopelessly inept as others have posted in a part that is so essential to the plot.  (and don't give me the star power excuse cause they already had Denzel Washington)..., I have always said that Shakespere done right is brilliant.. (done poorly it is pathetic)  and this is Shakespere done right in the purest sense of the term.

A very young Kate Beckinsale was a lovely Hero, and Denzel Washington delighted me as Don Pedro, the Prince. I've never seen Much Ado About Nothing in play form before, but I thought it made for a wonderful film. One got to see the beautiful Italian countryside and villa where the play takes place.

59,diogenes-858-449167,Much Ado About Nothing,3,8 February 2020,"Perhaps a simple, but important definition I learned at drama school can be applied to understand the failings of this piece of cinema. Theatre is about life. Film is lifelike. Putting Shakespeare on film is an intricate problem and proposition that very few film makers succeed in doing.Director, Kenneth Branagh, and his stellar cast, can't veil the fact they haven't addressed the above premise in attempting Much Ado. Film is unforgiving of even honest contrivances in an actor's performance, and this is Much Ado's burgeoning failure throughout.
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, and Polanski's Macbeth manage to skirt the death knell of this problem is by using relatively unknown actors.
Branagh's Much Ado can't do this. Every scene is peppered with movie stars, whose dazzling white teeth alone (kudos to Keaton's teeth for being the exception) deny our suspending disbelief to enter and be transported into the world of the characters. What might have seemed like a valid idea to Branagh at the time, results in movie stars, not characters inhabiting the story.
Michael Keaton's Dogberry comes closest to making a fist of it, allowing himself to transform into the character, but his exaggerated deliberation and pauses which work on stage eventually fall flat when delivered on film. His good character impulse work becomes the focus, but fails to have a context for it to spring from in the natural world we're observing around him. As for Ben Elton playing his sidekick, Verges, the less said about him the better.Quite simply, the theatricality which underpins Shakespeare's storytelling isn't supported in this modern use of film storytelling. It takes a clever director to find the compromise that will work for the audience - that is, allow them to suspend disbelief at the language and intrinsic staginess of theatre storytelling being put on film before them. Zeffirelli and Polanski used period culture, costume and location to establish a sense of theatricality for the time. It was enough to help the audience suspend disbelief, and even at times enhanced the purpose of the language. It allowed Shakespeare to be done on film without jarring conflicts for the audience.Branagh doesn't come to terms with the period his characters inhabit, so the locations he has them play provide little support for their performances. The actors can't fill the void this problem creates. For many scenes, the result is much like watching actors populate a diorama. All the jawing of the language, and training in doing Shakespeare the actors demonstrate, only serves to highten the lack in authenticity for what the audience are seeing.",Much Ado About Nothing
60,johnfuen,Delightful Version of Classic Shakespearian Comedy,9,5 October 2005,"When I was a high school Senior, I was fortunate to have a really good teacher for a course in Shakespeare. I always looked forward to going to her class. If you're out there, Ms. McGowan....thanks. One of the plays we studied was ""Much Ado about Nothing"". I was hooked by the sparing between Beatrice and Benedick. It was like a ""can you top this"" of insults between Joan Rivers and Don Rickles.I have been fortunate to see two stage presentation of this play and I think Kenneth Brannaugh's film adaptation holds up well against those stage presentations. Shakespeare's comedies are a bit hard to get into because of the ""Old English"" involved, but once you ""learn"" the language, just about any one of his comedies is better than the best modern sitcom.To give any one special praise in this movie is an exercise in futility because every one was fine. Of course, since Beatrice and Benedick are the main characters, the highlights of the movie are the ones were Brannaugh and Thompson are throwing insults at each other.If you like Shakespeare or good comedy....watch this one.",Much Ado About Nothing

And Comedies are always pose tougher questions than Tragedies. But director Kenneth Brannagh pulled it of very skillfully both as a director as well as an actor. Heavyweight Oscar winner Denzel Washington had nothing much to do in this movie as Don Pedro. Clearly the movie belonged to Kenneth Brannagh as Benedick, Emma Thompson as Beatrice and the surprise package Michael Keaton as the constable. His performance was so expressive and impressive that it's hard to believe this is the same guy who played the role of Batman in 'Batman(1989)'. It's a very cool enjoyable flick and almost as good as any Shakespearian comedy play. Well worth the time engaged in it.",Much Ado About Nothing
62,laika-lives,The Merry War Won,9,30 April 2006,"You have to give Kenneth Branagh credit for tackling Shakespeare's comedies (this and the later 'Love's Labours Lost') when most film makers have passed over them in favour of the more populist bloodletting of the Tragedies and Histories. Wit doesn't age as well as Pathos, and whilst modern audiences can cope with Iambic Pentameter whilst caught up in the urgent, fatalistic drive of 'Othello' or 'MacBeth', they are less likely to follow the comedies, based upon confusion and complication, when both the exposition and the jokes are in archaic English. With the arguable exception of 'The Taming of the Shrew', the comedies have never caught on as subjects for film. Branagh may be a less daring director stylistically than his obvious antecedent, Olivier, but his choice of plays is riskier (Oh, alright, he also directed 'Henry V' and 'Hamlet', just as Olivier did, but let's credit him for range and acknowledging the legacy Olivier left film, rather than berate him for not being entirely iconoclastic).Crucial to the success of this film is its lightness, the open, airy feeling Branagh discovers in the Tuscan locations, and the infectious buoyancy that carries the film through from the opening. Casting Hollywood stars in Shakespeare has never been done more acutely. Denzel Washington's image in the early nineties was still most associated with characters of integrity and moral strength, and he certainly seems ideal for the compassionate but authoritarian Duke. He also brings a guardedness and toughness that makes the Duke a believable veteran, a playfulness that makes me wish Washington had a go at comedy more often, and, unexpectedly, a ruthlessness (watch his eyes) that indicates what a great bad guy he'd make (although we had to wait a while). Keanu Reeves, as the actual bad guy, has less to do than anyone else, and he seems a little uncomfortable at times, but this actually works for the socially awkward 'bastard John', and he finds the character's intensity in a way more obvious actors probably wouldn't (he always seems a little on edge). The much maligned Reeves is probably the single most critically mocked actor working today, but he always gives his best performances as repellent characters (see also 'The Gift'), although his endearing doofishness in the 'Bill and Ted' films and unexpected charm in 'Something's Gotta Give' suggests untapped range, and a much-wasted talent that doesn't deserve to calcify in action films (all that stony-faced action in the Matrix trilogy can't be good for an actor so frequently compared to balsa wood). 'Thumbsucker' bodes well.Robert Sean Leonard's casting borders on brilliant cruelty, his sunny superficiality exposing Claudio's fickleness and bad faith. There almost seems to be a void behind that perfect smile. A cherubic Kate Beckinsale makes a pleasant Hero, a little bland but ideal as Claudio's innocent other half (are her early-Hurley big eyebrows supposed to represent her lack of vanity, hinting at her integrity next to her flawless, feckless lover? Okay, maybe not). Richard Briers is excellent as her father, giving an elegant portrayal of a kind, generous man whose dignity is suddenly stripped away. Michael Keaton is one of those comedians whose talents are rarely unleashed full-strength on the big screen. His turn as Dogberry ranks, along with 'Beetlejuice', as his most uninhibited role. He plays Dogberry as a genuine lunatic, totally unpredictable and occasionally violent. He feels dangerous, in a way actors playing Shakespeare never really do. He doesn't seem too awed or respectful of the material, and as such brings it to life in a new way. It's one of the two genuinely great performances that make this film, for me, the best Shakespeare adaptation of the Nineties.The other is Emma Thompson's Beatrice. I haven't seen enough versions of this play to throw around terms like 'definitive', but this feels like a role fully explored, all the nuances drawn out, all the ambiguities taken into account. Obviously that's nonsense - Beatrice will continue to be played, and actresses and directors will continue to find new aspects to her, but there are so many facets to Thompson's that it's dizzying. Her verbal sparring with Branagh's Benedick is joyous, perfectly timed but revealing (look at the way in which, at the end of their first exchange, she delivers her parting shot to herself, almost under her breath. Thompson's choice, or Branagh's? Either way, it's a telling little moment). She finds the melancholy in the wit, particularly in her exchanges with Washinton's Duke (their discussion of marriage during the masquerade is beautiful, a little masterpiece in itself), and has such an ear for comic delivery and such an understanding of Shakespeare's language she reinvigorates a lot of the archaic wit (even the 'Seville/Civil' pun sort of works). And the moment when she tells Benedick what he can do to help her is a reminder that Shakespeare's comedies have real teeth, as does Thompson. This was (until 2001's almost unbearably acute 'Wit') her finest performance, unrecognised because, hey, it's Shakespeare, and a comedy at that, and the rest of the cast is so good. The well-made but rather staid 'Howard's End' won her an Oscar instead. As for Branagh's performance, it seems engagingly self-deprecating, considering his reputation for egotism. The preening but insecure Benedick is his most likable role, a far cry from the accusations of smugness thrown at 'Peter's Friends', or those of self-regard thrown at his 'Hamlet'. And I didn't mention the great use of the song 'Sigh not so', or the wonderfully daft 'heroes on horseback' moment at the beginning. I also didn't mention that with a bit of off-hand nudity at the beginning, Washington in uniform and Reeves with his shirt off, it's also cheerfully and innocently sexy in a way that Franco Zefirelli could never dream of. Rarely for a Shakespeare film, there's no sense of duty required to watch this.",Much Ado About Nothing

I was right and it was. The acting was particularly good in the comic moments (Benedick not being able to sit on the chair after he hears that Beatrice loves him in particular) but Robert Sean Leonard I think, overacted a little.

Even if it was Branagh's (bad) choice for Reeves to play him as straight-up evil, he is unbelievable in the role. Add this to his semi-Shakespearean performance in My Own Private Idaho, and I come to the conclusion that Keanu Reeves should be banned from ever performing Shakespeare.Michael Keaton's performance is pretty weird, but at least he's in the right frame of mind. Everything else about the film is wonderful, and this is surely one of the best film adaptations of Shakespeare.",Much Ado About Nothing

That's too bad because the setting and the scenery looked great; very bright, colorful and full of sunshine. I think had the dialogue been all modern English, I would have enjoyed it much more.

67,hylinski,Uplifting,9,19 May 2010,This is a wonderful presentation of the immortal bard to the popular audience. A consistently brilliant cast and exuberant direction balance the unfortunate tendency to edit the original script which many movies seem to thing essential to give Shakespeare mass appeal. Apart from the slapstick of the watch (Michael Keaton and Ben Elton) there is little which was not clearly apparent in the original play. The breadth of the sets and the unrestrained romance in the music finish off the glorious feel this film has throughout.Possible the finest romantic comedy of all time with the possible exception of Twelth Night.,Much Ado About Nothing
68,o_levina,Brilliant! And sure to make people interested in Shakespeare once again,10,19 November 2001,"It's one of the most delightful adaptations of Shakespeare ever made. Personally, I am a great fan of Shakespeare, but it seems that the film must appeal even to those who normally don't like the Bard.   Kenneth Branagh is at his best both as producer and performer. I admire his imagination and ingenuity, which he applies to his work. He created beautiful, picturesque, entertaining, amusing and hilarious movie with awesome actor's work and fine music. Some cuts of the original play were essential to make the movie dynamic, and the play was not considerably damaged. All members of the starring cast make Shakespearean text sound natural, alive and very funny. Emma Thompson shines as bright ginger-haired Beatrice. It goes without saying that she's an actress of unique talent, and in this film she does an amazing job, being lively, sharp and witty, sparkling with energy, humor and cheerfulness, or sometimes vehement and passionate (when her cousin is offended). Branagh as Benedick is up to her. Other notable performances are given by imposing Brian Blessed (seigneur Antonio) and Richard Briers (seigneur Leonato). Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckinsale as Claudio and Hero are adequate and beautiful pair. Keanu Reeves is really good in the part of grim, villainous Don John, notwithstanding opinions of many reviewers here. Michael Keaton's Constable Dogberry and other comic characters makes me laugh a lot through the film. Definitely, this is an excellent film for enjoyment. 10/10.",Much Ado About Nothing

Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Denzel Washington, but isn't this taking diversity to a ridiculous level? There was no such thing as a black nobleman in medieval Italy. And why doesn't he have a British accent like everyone else? Keanu Reeves worsens things considerably. I would like to know what came over the directors when they decided to cast him for his part. Like all things that have to do with Shakespeare, this film is overrated to the point of lunacy. When you strip away all of the sentimental fluff and annoying archaic language, it is merely a soap opera. 1 out of 5.",Much Ado About Nothing
70,kimmb,Stunning and witty--Shakespeare at his best,10,13 August 1999,"Kenneth Branagh has done so much for Shakespeare...I've almost become a complete zealot of his work. This screen adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies is absolutely divine. The lovers Claudio and Hero are completely and wonderfully upstaged by Benedick and Beatrice, the most perfectly mismatched pair in the history of love, exactly as they were meant to be. The chemistry between Ken and Emma is so believable (after all, this was filmed before their marriage ended), the lines are so cunningly delivered, and the plot is so beautifully twisted and resolved that this movie is at the very top of my list of favorites. The setting is absolutely gorgeous--Italy in all its Summer glory. You can fairly taste the sunshine. Each part is completely delightful (Michael Keaton is perfect in one of the most bizarrely comedic roles I've ever seen, and as far as Keanu Reeves' performance, all I can say is that the part was written to be played in that manner. Don John was a bad guy of necessity--every comedy must have a foil). I found the entire production to be beautifully done and quite up to the professional standards that I've come to expect under Branagh's excellent direction. The wit sparkles and cracks between Beatrice and Benedick; a direct counter to the more traditional and borderline sappy form of Elizabethan love exhibited between Hero and Claudio. *This* is how the wise woo, and no, it is never peaceably! A smart, funny and visually stunning gem of a film to add to Branagh's already distinguished repertoire. I'm waiting for his MacBeth.",Much Ado About Nothing
71,theanomaloushost,"Not bad, if you can tolerate Michael Keaton.",6,17 February 2021,"The film is solid enough for what it is. A nice adaptation of a Shakespeare classic. But Michael Keaton nearly derails the whole thing, even if he's just in a few scenes briefly. Primarily because he went so over-the-top with his character depiction. He stands out so much from everyone else, and not in a good way. Not exactly the best depiction of Dogberry I've seen.If you can handle that though, the film is fine.",Much Ado About Nothing

How could one miss, with Branagh, Emma Thompson, Brian Blessed, et. al?  I always enjoy it, also, because it has one of my favorites, Michael Keaton, as Dogberry.  That man has so many talented sides, that it's always satisfying and delightful to watch his actions.  Such scenery!  Branagh has thought of everything in this one.  He is another actor whose films I always make it a point to see.  A true artist.  I remember Emma Thompson from when she had a weekly television comedy show.  Another example of true talent, which she displays in every role she plays.  Denzel Washington never fails to be convincing, and his movies are a must on my list, also.",Much Ado About Nothing
73,rimnod,The Peas and Seas of Much Ado About Nothing,7,3 October 2006,"THE PEASWords given by William ShakespeareAnother masterful adaptation of Shakespeare to film given by Kenneth BranaghThe beautiful light of sunny Tuscany - Watching this film's location shots can summon up images of summer even on a dark and dreary winter's day Branagh's use of mainline American actors such as Denzel Washington as Don Pedro, Keanu Reeves as Don John and Michael Keaton as Dogberry provides an interesting contrast with accomplished Shakespearian actors such as Briers (Lenato) and Blessed (Antonio). A great deal of pleasant suspense is added to the equation as the viewer eagerly hangs on every word - in every scene - anticipating flubs as the Hollywood acolytes attempt Shakespeare. At the same time we have the sturdy declamations made by the British pro's who are accustomed to projecting the Bard through on up and to the last row with a ceaseless and stagy confidenceWatch carefully as Washington (Don Pedro) engages Beatrice (Emma Thompson) in talk of getting a husband:------------Beatrice: Good Lord for alliance! Thus goes everyone to the world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a corner and cry 'heigh-ho!' for a husband. Don Pedro: Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.Beatrice: I would rather have one of your father's getting. Hath your grace not a brother like you? Your father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them. Don Pedro: Will you have me, lady? Beatrice: No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days. Your Grace is too costly to wear everyday. But I beseech your Grace to pardon me; for I was born to speak all mirth and no matter. Don Pedro: Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour. Beatrice: No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there was a star danced, and under that was I born... (Beatrice exits)Don Pedro: By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady. --------------Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckinsdale make a pretty pair as the young lovers, Claudio and Hero. Kate Beckinsdale comes across as being particularly well scrubbedBranagh and his then wife Thompson were more than up to playing the roles of Benedick and Beatrice, the once assiduous enemies brought to the altar by a curious subterfuge of emotion foisted on them by their friends Branagh (Benedick) slamming Leonard (Claudio) up against the wall to deliver a threat of mortal retribution for the wrongs done to Hero. Emma Thompson's voice heard as her words flash over the still blacked out screen at the beginning of the movie and the song at the end are both memorable and provide this movie-play with an effective entrance and exitTHE SEASOne shot--and it's a short one--shown at the beginning of the film of Don Pedro's men offering a cheer as they exult in their full galloped charge towards Messina. The whole company of soldiers is flashed on a wide front on the whole screen in much the same manner as the opening to Bonanza. I kept looking for Hoss and Little Joe to show themselves amongst the merry company A shirtless Keanu Reeves (Don John) gets what must qualify as the oiliest massage in the history of film from one of his henchman -- Branagh trying to offer up a little beefcake to any of Reeves' fans who might have accidentally stumbled into the theater. Leonardo and Beckinsdale (Claudio and Hero) cavort like young foals around Beatrice and Benedick's contrempts too quickly after Hero's revealed resurrection.It's interesting to consider that Branagh and Thompson were a bit more than halfway through their short marriage at the time that they played Benedick and Beatrice. They both excel in their roles --however, Branagh seems to outdo Thompson in the shift of emotion that takes place that turns these sworn, twin haters of marriage into lovebirds. Thompson seems to lose just a little in this transition. Watch for a bit of a hitch in the scene where she bids Benedick to go and kill Claudio. Benedick resists at first but then agrees as a concession to his new love for Beatrice. Thompson trudges away from Branagh just an instant of a second too soon in this exchange --and doesn't seem able to return any of the decisive governance of passion that Branagh exhibits. Makes you wonder what may have been going on (or going off) off-camera. .",Much Ado About Nothing
74,Katherina_Minola,Hey Nonny Nonny - wonderful adaptation,10,4 December 2013,"This Shakespeare play revolves around two pairs of lovers – Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale), who find that because of the deception of others, the path of true love does not always run smoothly; and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) and Benedick (Kenneth Branagh), who have an antagonistic relationship and fall in love almost against their own wills.Kenneth Branagh directs, co-produces and stars in this adaptation, and what a truly wonderful adaptation it is. It is full of colour and life, and left me with such a feeling of happiness afterwards, that it should be available to view on prescription! Denzel Washington has never looked more handsome than he does here as the Spanish Prince Don Pedro, Richard Briers as Hero's father Leonato and Brian Blessed as Leonato's brother Antonio are both wonderful in their roles, and Kate Beckinsale is sweet and lovely as Hero. It hardly needs to be said that Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are both note-perfect as the squabbling Benedick and Beatrice, making perfect use of Shakespeare's sharp and witty banter. It's worth mentioning Michael Keaton's small but important part as police constable Dogberry, which he certainly makes the most of, stealing most of the scenes he is in. The casting isn't perfect – Keanu Reeves is an odd choice for the villain Don John, who leads Claudio into mistakenly believing that Hero has been unfaithful, and Robert Sean Leonard is rather wooden as Claudio. However, there is so much to enjoy in this film that it hardly matters.Although it does contain dark themes – the aborted first wedding of Claudio and Hero is upsetting, particularly as the viewer knows that Hero has been slandered – it is mainly cheerful with a happy tone throughout. I'd recommend this to fans and non-fans of Shakespeare alike. It is definitely one of my favourite Shakespeare adaptations.",Much Ado About Nothing

76,Tomrad,I love it!,9,14 June 2000,"It's great! It helps that I'm a fan of Shakespeare anyway, but you hardly notice the language for most of it, so I'd recommend it even if you weren't a Shakespeare fan! Kenneth Branagh is superb. The bit with the deck-chair just cracked me up! His character is naturally a very funny and his interaction with Emma Thompson was wonderful. He brought out the best in that character. Robert Sean Leonard was the classic wussy lover and his bride, Kate Beckinsale, was wonderful as well. If you watch shooting fish, you'll notice that she has exactly the same expression on her face at the end of both movies. Keanu Reeves's ""villain"" was certainly interesting, if a little hollow. It almost worked. Denzel Washington was also very good as Don Pedro, very big brother-ish and valiant, just like you'd want a prince to be.This is just a great film. It looks almost as if Kenneth Branagh got together a bunch of his mates and said ""d'you fancy goin' to Sicily, we could, I dunno, make a film or something"". This is a film to watch on a cold snowy winter's day, with the fire blazing. It's very uplifting. The long continuous shot at the end, where the camera goes through the house and courtyard and into the grounds and then slowly rises up while everyone is dancing. Oh, that's one criticism I can make - that song really got on my nerves. Hey nonny nonny! 9 out of 10",Much Ado About Nothing
77,laurakay76,A Shakespeare buff speaks.,8,23 June 2003,"I'm picky about Shakespeare; you might call me a purist. If things fly too far of the mark, I can be very disgruntled. For instance, I saw a stage performance of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" where all the characters wore clothing from the 1940s. And there was a showing of ""As You Like It"" in which Orlando, the poetry-writing hero, affixes his love sonnets to trees by using Post-It notes. Ugh.Because of this pickiness, I was reluctant to watch a film version of Shakespeare. But my best friend insisted that I sit down and take in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing."" It's not the first time she was right, certainly won't be the last either -- because to say I loved this movie is no exaggeration.Most people already know the plot well enough that I can skip that explanation. Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson, are radiantly cast as the bickering Benedick and Beatrice, and their on screen chemistry is enough to make one sorry that their marriage didn't work out. Nearly all the performances are up to snuff; Kate Beckinsale is believably emotional as the falsely accused Hero, Richard Briers is delightful as Hero's father, and practically every supporting actor adds to the overall enjoyment.Many other reviewers have commented on the suitability of Denzel Washington for a Shakespearean role. While, admittedly, he looks just slightly out of place in the film, I found no quarrel with his delicate and genteel handling of the worthy Prince of Aragon. Keanu Reeves has been much maligned for his wooden performance as the prince's bastard brother Don John, but I consider it bearable, if for no other reason than that he doesn't appear often. Michael Keaton is insane as the constable Dogberry, and the scenes in which he speaks are the most tedious for me -- but that has less to do with the acting than with the script itself, and he certainly does no harm.The only thing I really didn't enjoy about the film was the repetitious use of a rather irksome little song used only once in the original material. But Branagh's handling of the story impressed me enough that I rented his ""Hamlet."" Shakespeare purist or no, ""MAAN"" is an excellent choice the next time you want to sit down with something romantic, fluffy, and easy to swallow.",Much Ado About Nothing
78,KatieBug19,"Shakespeare at his giddy, delightful, spectacular best!",8,29 May 2002,"I must begin with the confession that this play, above all the other comedies of Shakespeare, holds a special place in my heart.  It was the first play of Shakespeare's I attended and this specific production was the first film version Shakespeare I experienced.  My friends and I, even though we were only eleven or twelve at the time, were inspired.  Inside our hearts a life-long love of Shakespeare began to grow.  This film makes Shakespeare accessible without changing or belittling it.  This film entertains and impresses without masquerading as something that it is not.  Above all of that, this film embodies its own unique vision (and, I feel, Shakespeare's as well).Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Robert Sean Leonard and the unbelievable Kenneth Branagh make this film.  The supporting cast is also excellent, but they could not be so without these fabulous actors.  Each movement, look and action fits the script so well you would think Shakespeare himself were the director.  The humor becomes as fresh and modern as anything else produced today, except that it has the timeless quality of truly wonderful entertainment.  Yes, the story is a little silly and contrived, but a little research into the Elizabethan period (or remembering the ridiculous things that went on in high school) convinced me of its possibility.  I have seen the film probably a hundred times now, and each time I catch new nuances in the performances, I find more fun in the word play and I rejoice in the comfort of watching something that is honestly worth every second.To be fair, there are several issues with the film I should address.  My only complaint would be Michael Keaton.  I, personally, could handle it if he toned down his act, but that's artistic freedom for you.  The major complaints I have heard from others about the film are that the landscape becomes one of the characters, distracting from the plot and Keanu Reeves is terrible.  I think, first, Tuscany is beautiful and there is little anyone could do about that.  This is the location specified in the script, and if it becomes another force in the play - so be it!  I thought the amazing sun-drenched hills only added to the effect of the movie and was not bothered at all.  The problem with Keanu (Don John), however, can not be pawned off so simply.  I hate to admit it, but it is true, he is awful beyond words.  (But isn't he always?  At least he doesn't get to say ""duh."") I think the really issue is that that the character is sort of a cop out, no matter who is playing it.  Really, what is his motive for messing with everyone else's lives?  Who does he think he is?  Since Shakespeare had already constructed fabulously convincing villains when he wrote this play, I think that Don John is weak for a purpose.  Weak because ""MAAN"" is not supposed to be about deep motives, it is supposed to be entertaining!  The title itself refers not only to love, but also to theatre.  It is reminiscent of Theseus' line in ""A Midsummer's Night Dream"": ""The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst no worse if imagination amend them.""So, what are you doing reading this?  Go out and rent this movie and begin living a Shakespearean life as soon as possible!",Much Ado About Nothing
79,fourwinds4,"Visually Stunning, Brilliant Acting, Magical, Great Fun!",10,24 June 2012,"This is a movie I watch about once a year. The opening 10 minutes are worth it alone... Emma Thompson's lilting voice reading Shakespeare's verse ""Hey Nonny Nonny"" about philandering men against the backdrop of gorgeous Tuscany: the white bodices of the women, the red of the grapes and then the scene with the men riding in ... great movie making!!The banter between Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (Thompson) is perfect, I loved all the American actors, particularly Denzel Washington as the Prince and Keanu Reeves as the bastard brother.. they were both very good. I also really appreciate Branagh's interpretation of Shakespeare and his delivery.. and the way he encourages the ensemble to deliver Shakespeare, so much more real than the awkward Shakespeare delivery of old. With any Shakespeare piece, you know the story has to be excellent and Much Ado About Nothing is no exception. This is a wonderful romp through the countryside of Tuscany, the music is very good, there are some hilarious scenes and the costumes are just magical.

The acting and direction was amazing and through this, Shalespears best work (only my opinion of course) was truly brought to life.I thought Emma Thompson and Keneth Branagh stole the show as Beatrice and Benedick, who have always been my favourite characters. The other main reason for my great loving of this play/movie is that there is a strong female character, who is more than a match for a strong male character. She is not repressed and Benedick does not manage to 'tame' her. Hurrah!This really is a masterpiece and people would have to be foolish to say otherwise",Much Ado About Nothing
81,Lorenzo H.,Energetic and highly entertaining film marred only by Keaton's performance.,7,28 February 2000,"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is a virtual feast for the eyes and ears.  From the beautiful Tuscany landscapes and wonderful music score to the great performances of Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson and Denzel Washington, this film's high energy and good spirits will effortlessly sweep you off your feet.   For close to an hour this movie can do no wrong and has some great visual and comedic moments.  It is around this time however, that we are unfortunately introduced to the character of the constable played by Michael Keaton.  His scenes in the middle third of the movie seem quite incongruous with the rest of the film.  Every word out of his mouth is virtually unintelligible.  To make things worse, his performance is so `Pythoneseque' and over-the-top that it actually feels like slow torture watching it.  Its as if Beetlejuice had suddenly invaded the movie.  Director Branagh's mistake was not in casting Keaton in the role, but in having him play the character as he did.The Film happily does rebound in its last twenty minutes and concludes in a moving and joyfully uplifting celebration that is extremely well choreographed.  This last sequence consists of one long, continuous tracking shot which is truly amazing.  The camera starts at ground level and weaves in and out of courtyards, buildings and dancing revelers to end up not only a good city block from where it started but what actually seems to be ten stories high looking down on the proceedings with a gods eye view.  It is a fantastic end to a flawed but extremely entertaining movie.  I recommend it to all lovers of not only Shakespeare, but of feel good' movies as well. Had it not been for Keaton's sour note performance, I would have given the film an 8.  As it is, a 7 out of 10 will have to suffice.",Much Ado About Nothing
82,angel_de_tourvel,A beautiful film to enjoy,9,1 July 2004,"I saw this one or two years ago, and I loved it utterly. Not only has it a great cast including shakesperian actors Kenneth Brannagh and Emma Thompson, it also has a lovely, warm feel to it; set in the sunny countryside of Italy; perfect to watch on a summer's evening.   Although I am a dedicated admirer of Laurence Olivier, the legend who's reputation Brannagh is often set up against; I must admit that nobody would ever suit the role of Benedick as Brannagh does He was perfect; fun, natural and wittily amusing to watch. As for Emma Thompson; she gave a fantastically fiery performance as Beatrice of the untamed tongue; watching she and Brannagh go for each other in their satirical arguments was fantastic.  Then there was Kate Beckindsale; one who I really would not have expected in a film such as this, but she did an exemplary and satisfying job as the fair Hero; although put completely in the shade by Emma Thompson. Keanu Reeves, the film star who I reckon NOBODY would have expected in a film such as this was surprisingly very good as the schemingly dark Don Jon, he suited the hiss-hiss villain's role deliciously. One who I thought could have been cast better was Robert Sean Leonard, as Claudio; who, although fine in scenes of wit and amusement; became forced in scenes of anger and sadness. Despite this, I thought he too suited the part well. I highly recommend this film to all who enjoy shakespeare, great English actors, or just good fun.",Much Ado About Nothing
83,Tararaboomdia0101,Branagh at his best,10,12 October 2005,"This is one of my all time favourite films - a classic feel good movie with all the humour and wit of Shakespeare blended with a star studded cast, lovely Italian scenery and directed by Kenneth Branagh. What could go wrong? Well, nothing to be honest. All the cast did well, I've heard minor qualms about the casting of Reeves as the villain, but personally I think he pulled it off superbly. Kate Beckinsale, not a big name at the time is able to cope admirably in the role of Hero, her shining moment in the film is her reaction to the disastrous wedding scene. The stars of the film are, unsurprisingly Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson who are truly wonderful as the sparring Beatrice and Benedick. They convey a magnificent chemistry in every encounter.Much Ado has to be one of my favourite plays, a fresh relief from the doom and gloom of Branagh's other works. This is a film to watch which is guaranteed to leave you with a satisfied smile on your face by the end. There are plenty of highlights, the main one of which is the hilarity of Beatrice and Benedick each overhearing from their scheming friends the one's supposed love for the other.I have nothing bad to say about this film - except that it took me too long to find it on DVD.",Much Ado About Nothing
84,amabiliscasa,"Delightful, A Film That Outdoes Itself",9,16 September 2003,"I rented this film, having seen some photographs from it, and having read the play (which is my favorite of Shakespeare's), so I did not really know what to expect. I was floored. I laughed and cried, I got goosebumps all over and found a new film to add to my list of favorites. This is something special. Kenneth Branagh is just perfect as the eloquent Benedick, bringing out shades of heroism, humor, wit, romance and gaiety in his performance. Emma Thompson is hilarious from her first lines (""God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured!"") and she perfectly captures Beatrice wit and wisdom in her performance. She and Branagh have real chemistry, and the films most exhilarating scene is when she and Benedick admit that they love the other, and both give free reign to their emotion; Benedick by splashing through a fountain, and Beatrice by swinging like a little girl again.Kate Beckinsale and Robert Sean Leonard are quite good as fair Hero and the passionate Claudio, bringing a bit more life to the romance of the two. Claudio was properly gullible and hot-blooded, sentimental and quick to act, and Hero was gentle and modest, laughing at her cousin and obeying her father, a calming influence on her betrothed. I also enjoyed Denzel Washington's Don Pedro - he seemed always in control, honorable and solicitous of everyone, as the Prince should be. Richard Briers was also very good as Signoir Leonato, Hero's wise and gentle father. Michael Keaton was very funny - so over the top; I had never thought that much humor could be invested into the character of Dogberry, the constable, though sometimes I want to fast-forward his scenes and get back to our two couples. Very badly done was John the Bastard, played by Keanu Reeves as very wooden and one-note. He looks as if he is ready to stab someone in every scene, instead of being devious and calculating. The scenery is beautiful, and Patrick Doyle (who composed another one of my favorite films and scores, Sense and Sensibility) really outdid himself with the music. The best examples of this are the song ""Sigh No More, Ladies"", the opening sequence, the fountain/swing scenes, and Hero's first wedding. A wonderful introduction to Shakespeare, and a truly enjoyable film for those long aquatinted with the Bard. Ere you watch anything else, see this truly excellent film!",Much Ado About Nothing

This is, in my mind, the clearest indication that the play has been done well.
The cast is excellent across the board.  Anyone who says Denzel Washington is not a good classical actor is CRAZY.  Braunagh and Thompson are both excellent, and Kenneth really out does himself here.Great flick; check it out.Oh, special mention goes to the set; incredible job of putting you in a Shakespearean setting.",Much Ado About Nothing
87,ctando,Vibrant and enjoyable,8,9 January 2002,"I love this film! I saw it 6 times in the theater when it first came out. Branagh's love for the Bard shows clearly in his adaptations. I love his relationship with Thompson onscreen, especially knowing that they were married at the time. I always enjoy watching them spar.Before I rave about it there are two things worth noting for parents screening this film for their kids. The beginning of the film contains nudity as all the characters bathe in preparation for meeting each other (en masse, too). The other is the portrayal of sex. It is a key element but could have been done more discreetly. I certainly didn't need to hear the sound effects (and I don't mean vocalizations). I also quibble with the casting. I'm picky. I just don't care for Americans in British roles (unless they can fake a passable accent). Denzel Washington was pretty good. Keanu Reeves was downright jerky (although he broods well). Shakesperean English simply doesn't sit well on his tongue. I can't say I cared for Robert Sean Leonard. He's a bit...whiny. I didn't care if he got Hero or not. I do strongly disagree with the comment about Michael Keaton, though. He really surprised me! He was *wonderful* as Dogberry!The English actors are entirely up to par, as usual. One thing, though. Kate Beckinsale is *perfect* as Hero. She is so apple-cheeked and earthy...just lovely! What on earth have they done to her since then?!?

It was a real laugh watching Michael Keaton perform. That is, I'm praising him of his splendid role-playing.Michael Keaton's acting was really entertaining to say the least. Except for Benedick, out of all the characters I was mostly drawn to him for the way he portrayed Dogberry. Not having known that he played as Batman and just remembered him as the father of Lindsay Lohan in Herbie. I was fully impressed! If you want to see Michael Keaton acting a crazier side, see this film. It's a pity that he came out in just 4 scenes.",Much Ado About Nothing
89,Skylark-4,Quite good overall,6,20 April 2000,"I've read so many comments here about the great cast that I want to add a contrary opinion or two.  First, Emma Thompson doesn't fit my conception of Beatrice at all.  (Surely I can't be alone in this opinion.)  And on the other hand, I haven't read enough comments about the WONDERFUL performance of Michael Keaton -- who simply steals the whole show.",Much Ado About Nothing
90,Iverson2001,Meant for its Time Period,10,26 February 2004,"When you see most movies like this right now in theatres they are modernized versions of this. The only difference is that when people modernize this play indirectly they don't make it nearly as good as this. The romance and evilness in this clash and come together to make the perfect love story between Count Claudio of Florence/Hero and Beatrice/Benedick while having Don John try and ruin everything. I found it interesting at points how clever Shakespeare was when he wrote this playwright. An example, how Beatrice and Benedick were tricked into falling in love. Did they love each other the whole time? It is up to the viewer. I would think that they would have loved each other the whole time but it is the cleverish ways like these that make the viewer think of questions like these. Also how Leonato can change, almost like he has two faces. At the first wedding after Don Pedro and Claudio said they saw her with another man he said mean things, pulled her by the hair and slapped her. It makes you think, could Leonato be thought of as a bad person even though he seems gentle and nice like his daughter? Even though this was a pretty good movie it had its weak points. The actor of Claudio, very poor. When he heard news of Hero ""dying"" he acted like nothing had happened that he was still waiting for the news. Denzel Washington was amazing as usual and Keanu Reeves did a decent job. Another weak point of this movie, it isn't really a weak point but in the eyes of a viewer today most people would think the beginning with the army returning to Messina, a little childish and corny. It could be considered this for the way people run down the hill, sudden bustling around the village and then you see horses coming toward Messina with music playing. It isn't terrible but just a little obscure and makes one possibly think about what people would do if this army weren't here for the amount of excitment shown. And of course the way Shakespeare rights this play, the passion he shows through the writing, the graceful ways of old english to the full extent in this playwright. There were also other points in this movie filled with more cleverness such as the banquet scene with Beatrice saying rude things to Benedick we he doesn't know she knows it is him. Common today but in this case and the time and place, very clever. No one can forget the scene where you are thinking Hero is dead and Claudio is about to marry her cousin and then under the veil low and behold is Hero as Claudio apologizes for not seeing that Margaret had been used to trick Claudio into thinking that Hero had done such a cruel thing. Overall I give it 8 stars, a pretty good movie from an amazing writer, more worthy than any other writer to this day and any other day.",Much Ado About Nothing
91,simplystreeptacular,"Too wise to woo peaceably, indeed",10,15 April 2006,"There is no other actor/director today who can match Kenneth Branagh's talent with Shakespeare. Even though this was at the beginning of his career, he sparkles as the witty lord of Padua who vows never to wed but changes his mind when he meets the one woman in all Italy who can match him epithet for epithet. Beatrice, played by Branagh's then-wife and actress in her own right Emma Thompson, is a sparkling counterpoint to Branagh. Their chemistry is utterly believable and Kenneth's look when he turns around and sees Beatrice coming onto the balcony makes me swoon every time. Their dialogue is at once hilarious, tender, and romantic, and their kisses absolutely sizzle, most particularly their kiss in the chapel as they dance around each other but finally realize that they love 'nothing in the world so well' as each other. They are quantifiably the true lovers in this story... they sizzle with suppressed passion all the way through. They are so mad about each other and clearly want to snog each other senseless but can't find the courage to do it, so they engage in a witty repartee to disguise this truest of loves. They are absolutely perfect for each other in every way. Benedick plays the witty man who cannot abide love, but he is also a man of honor, of kindness, and of fondness. Beatrice too covers herself up as a witty, lighthearted lady, but she loves her cousin deeply and is more than eager to revenge her cousin's honor. Thompson and Branagh take the meeting of soul mates to the ultimate level, far and away giving the best performances in the entire film. The archaic speech rolls easily off their tongues, conversational and impromptu, without any stiffness or uncertainty whatsoever.But others deserve mention as well. Denzel Washington is a quietly dignified Don Pedro, Keanu Reeves is a satisfyingly evil villain, Robert Sean Leonard has the ladies swooning as Claudio, and Kate Beckinsale makes a wide-eyed, innocent, and drop-dead gorgeous Hero. This is a movie you can watch and fall in love with again and again. Claudio and Hero exhibit typical Elizabethan-style love, while, as noted above, Beatrice and Benedick are altogether more sophisticated and deep in their relationship.Kenneth Branagh made this film a sparkling gem of a film, taking Shakespeare, as he has before and would again, to the height of art.",Much Ado About Nothing
92,Lil_miss_tazzy,Perfection,10,10 January 2008,"I LOVE this adaptation of Much Ado. It's bright and breezy, on the whole well-acted and the setting is just beautiful. Thompson and Branagh are perfectly cast and just light up the screen.I am rather biased seeing as this is my favourite Shakespeare play - with the possible exception of The Taming of the Shrew - and i find the romantic plot line sensational. The chemistry between Beatrice and Benedick is wonderful; sparks really fly off one another when each is still in 'hatred' zone and when they finally confess their love they really seem to mean it. This is helped by the fact that Branagh and Thompson were actually married at the time of filming so one could truly imagine that these actors were passionate about each other.I agreed with previous comments about Keanu Reeves' poor performance when first watching the film; he was rather wooden; but having seen other productions of this play i have realised that Don John is a shallow and bland character and therefore Keanu's attempt wasn't too appalling.Overall a great effort and i think that this is just one of those films i will re-watch constantly and never get bored.If you're a fan of this play i do recommend the BBC updated version of it from the 2005 ShakespeaRetold series, because although it is nowhere near the quality of the Branagh version, it does maintain the spirit of the original play and is a really enjoyable watch.",Much Ado About Nothing

It is set against the backdrop of breathtaking Tuscan scenery in vivid colours.
Be prepared to interpret the original Shakespeare prose, but at the same time be thankful that Brannagh has included enough visual aids, vocal intonations and facial expressions to ensure that the plot is not lost on anyone.  As a result, this film should be enjoyed by most, even those with no interest in Shakespeare.",Much Ado About Nothing

96,schweitzer7654,Absolutely Brilliant!,10,27 June 2003,"*SPOILERS* Shakespeare's comedy, 'Much Ado About Nothing' is one of the most enjoyable plays ever written by Shakespeare.   Acting out Shakespeare well is already a hard task but actually directing, producing and as well writing the screenplay and playing a Shakespearean character is a tremendous feat; and the one doing all this, is Kenneth Branagh. This film is amazing with its great acting, costumes, music and the beautiful gardens are a major plus as well. Standing out from the rest of the other characters are the bickering, witty Benedick and Beatrice, marvellously acted by Kenneth Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson. Denzel Washington plays Don Pedro, prince of Arragon and lord to Benedick and Claudio and Robert Sean Leonard plays the easily-lead Claudio, Kate Beckinsale plays the honest Hero and Michael Keaton is the bumbling constable, Dogsberry. The only problem with the film is the lack of effort from Keanu Reeves' Don John, who is Don Pedro's half-brother. Shakespeare wanted Don John to be a sort of cold hearted villain, something like Hans Gruber from the movie, 'Die Hard', I can hardly hear a word from Don John, it sounds as if he's talking to himself rather than giving orders around to his henchmen, Borachio and Conrade, I don't blame Keanu Reeves' for trying, but this is definitely not a film you want to watch him in if you're a Keanu Reeves' fan. The scenes played out in the film are touching, detailed and full of energy but one of my favourite scenes was when Benedick overhears Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio that Beatrice loves him, which of course is a lie but of course Benedick doesn't know this but believes it anyway. (If you watch the film I guess you'll understand why.)   The music was lovely, composed by the celebrated composer Patrick Doyle, the two songs, one of them which I think is called, 'Hey nonny nonny' and the other was played at Hero's memorial service was memorable and I couldn't stop humming the tune 'Hey nonny nonny' for a few days after watching the film. The last shot in the film where everyone is singing and dancing must be mentioned, it's a long continuous shot, without any editing or cutting and it's breathtaking, it weaves through the courtyard, and then looks up at the balconies and there's confetti falling all over the place, then we follow Benedick, Beatrice, Claudio and Hero into the gardens and the film finishes with a bird's eye view of everyone joining hands, dancing and singing. Spectacular. This film is absolutely brilliant and I throughly reccommend it, hats off for Kenneth Branagh for this delightful and wonderfully romantic comedy, Shakespeare must be smiling somewhere...",Much Ado About Nothing

This production was wonderful, great cast, and Kenneth seemed to help them understand their characters with great force. This is the mark of a great director and a master in his craft. I finally was able to see the meaning of expression behind Shakespeare plays that I was not able to achieve simply by reading the plays. Wonderful, simply wonderful. The quality of his work and the care of detail the Kenneth places on his work make his productions simply remarkable and I hope to see many more of his productions soon.

I watched this film when it was first released and ignorantly didn't even realise it WAS a Shakespeare story until the opening credits appeared. My initial panic turned to pleasant surprise though, as I found myself laughing out loud and really getting into the story.This is one of Shakespeare's comedy romps with all the vital ingredients: comic idiot characters, villains, and of course, young lovers, whose path of true love does not run smooth.Kenneth Branagh stars and directs, and you really get the feel for how passionate he is about Shakespeare's plays. The whole cast seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves for entire film (apart from Keanu Reeves - possibly frustrated at his failure to produce an English accent, or possibly because he plays the baddie of the piece) which in turn transfers to the audience. The sunny climate and beautiful setting add to this, and by the end of the film, you wish you were there with them, dancing and singing forever in a land where all is bright and lively!

I loved their characters and couldn't wait to hear their dialogue. Denzel Washington's performance begins very stiffly but he does warm up to the character with time and his delivery improves, but never to the point of credibility.Keanu is NOT the problem in this film -- Michael Keaton is! His performance is so full of idiosyncratic ticks and gestures that I could hardly follow his dialogue -- a wasted casting if you ask me.The scenery and Tuscany setting are an additional tour-de-force and enhance the visual beauty of the film.I highly recommend it to both lovers of Shakespeare and those that want to get to know his work.",Much Ado About Nothing

Don't go in expecting an excellent score or outstanding lighting but it has it's moments. The props are good but Most of it's impact is in the delivery since the script was pre-written by about 381 years and the actors seem to get the job done most of the time (I'm looking at you Reeves!)

Only Keanu Reeves is disappointing (as always - sorry to say so, but there is nothing at all beneath the surface). But the greatest tribute to Briars who is England's great character actor.The setting of Tuscany is bright and merry and creates the perfect background for the actors.Please note that hilarious score who brings out joy, champagne and the sun of the South. Especially the main theme is wonderful in its majestic glory - it always makes me feel like a brave knight returning from a shakespearian battle!

It is Shakespeare done with real gusto and intelligence. The opening scenes, in particular, are vibrant, but the energy rarely flags throughout its 110 minutes. Ken Brannagh and Emma Thompson are finely matched as the duelling Benedict and Beatrice and there is a stand-out performance from (of all people) Keanu Reeves as Don John. The problem with this work is the source material - 'Much Ado' (as a play) sits uneasily with modern ideas of relations between men and women; and yet, the cast somehow get away with it - if it is 'ideologically' questionable, there is no doubt that Shakespeare's wit is sparkling.

108,mardri,"Very enjoyable, still current, still accessible, but one actor spoils the fun.",7,26 May 2008,"I bought the DVD of this play to add to my collection of recent film versions of Shakespeare plays (""Twelfth Night"", ""The Merchant of Venice,"" ""Midsummer Night's Dream,"" etc.). This film is still fresh and highly accessible, especially to younger American audiences (I've tested some of these on my teenage relatives) who might be turned off by the concept that ""Shakespeare"" means nothing more than some British theater company trying to educate the Colonials using ossified performances by theatrical statuary.I think Shakespeare plays should be inhabited by ordinary people who actually spoke a form of the English language that probably resembled its current American manifestations. After all, a lot of this country was settled by Scots-Irish immigrants, who brought an accent with them that still resembles what can be heard today in many parts of the British Isles. Not everyone over there speaks with that so-called ""Oxford"" accent.I loved the energy of this movie and was especially pleased by the performances of Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves, both of whom seemed to me to fit their roles very well. However, I was very disconcerted by Michael Keaton, who really smothered his character, Dogberry the Constable. One important aspect about Dogberry is that he mangles the language in a way that foreshadows the much more famous Mrs. Malaprop of Richard B. Sheridan's 18th-century play ""The Rivals"". In the film, alas, Mr. Keaton adopts a weird affect of gritting his teeth so tightly that his speech is almost unintelligible, thereby destroying the punchline of the extended linguistic joke that his character is supposed to be playing out. Mr. Branagh apparently didn't seem to mind this, but I do, and I discount the movie on this point.",Much Ado About Nothing

I found this quite by accident (flipping through channels and stopping when I wondered what were Denzel Washington AND Robert Sean Leonard doing in the same flick) On the whole, what I love about this movie is how natural the dialogue and setting are; none of the stilted portrayals I've come to associate with Shakespeare. For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.",Much Ado About Nothing
110,Endlessinstant,A surprising pleasure,8,4 August 2005,"I'll admit I never much cared for Much Ado About Nothing. Perhaps it was the dull study of the play, which seems a highlight of most Shakespeare courses, perhaps it stemmed from my fascination with Shakespeare's dramatic and historic works but my distaste for his comedic pieces.Perhaps it was because I never saw a good version of this play until this film came along. Now, I choose to watch it because there was little else on and I was confident that Branagh would give me SOMETHING to look at, even though I was not a Much Ado fan.And coming in, I found it quite dull, until Emma Thompson and Branagh squared off for the first time. Then I realized this was one of the most brilliant Shakespeare films yet created. Thompson and Branagh are completely ideal as opposites of one another. I found myself craving for them to be on screen when they were not, and I found myself caught up utterly in the film, even though I knew what the inevitable conclusion would be.And afterwards, I immedietly went and ordered the film. If you're a Shakespeare fan then, yes, it is -that- good. It is a perfect example of why Branagh's works are so incredibly enjoyable. Now, it is not the spectacular unabridged delight that is Branagh's Hamlet, but it has plenty to do and see. From Keanu Reeves as the villain Don John and Denzel Washington (a very WORTHY actor for Shakespeare) as Don Pedro to the aforementioned Branagh and Thompson, this cast is finely assembled.This is a film that I heartily recommend to anyone. If you've never seen a good production of Much Ado, or if you don't think you like Shakespeare much, I encourage you to watch this film. It may not change your mind, but boy is it ever a fun movie.",Much Ado About Nothing
111,caesarsiamese,Delightful nonsense,10,21 July 2005,"It is said that there are only seven plots in all the world, and Shakespeare used all of them. His themes are universal, written so that no member of the audience - whatever his station - is left unrepresented.This is why I found not just the direction but the casting so delightful in this particular version of Much Ado. Though arguably set in its own era, the cast mirrors a contemporary diversity which is the heart and soul of any accessible version of the plays. Thus did Don Pedro command both a dignity and humor, remembering his station while revealing himself to be quite human (Wilt thou have me, Lady?). When he's present it's impossible to look away.Playing with social conceptions is another classic Shakespearian device, as demonstrated by the admirable casting of Don John. Again tall, noble, yet menacing to a look, few of words, and coiled for battle even when there seems none. The brothers look nothing alike, stressing John's ""Bastard"" state to make a point perhaps lost on a contemporary audience, and offer a relevance to his actions which to some may seem obscure.Those were the two I found most interesting. Of the leading four it's nearly impossible to single any out - they're as outstanding as I expected. Though perhaps special mention should go to Emma Thompson for rendering tongue twisting lines with the speed and ease of a native speaker. Most of the time in a movie like this I'm aware that people are acting. Never her - her lines seem so lite and free she seems almost born in the wrong era.Of all the modern versions of our timeless Bard, I think only Richard III (McKellen) fares better. This Much Ado is food for the soul and should be cherished.",Much Ado About Nothing
112,maxhojones,A surprisingly fun film with numerous great performances,7,13 March 2017,"I first watched this film in an English lesson, when learning about the play/book it was based upon. I was immediately surprised to see such a famous cast including such big names and Kenneth Branagh, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reaves and Kate Beckinsale, along with other successful actors in smaller roles like Brian Blessed and Michael Keaton. In addition to this, this fantastic cast was not at all wasted, in that they performed their lines brilliantly and really helped you to enjoy each unique character. The writing and cinematography was also very impressive, though if i had one particular critique it would be how they often just straight-out repeated lines from the play, even going as far as to mimic entire scenes, word-for-word. This wouldn't be too much of a problem, and instead help develop the environment, had the lines been less excessive, and not sometimes just feel out of place, like they were saying them simply for the sake of it.

Michael Keaton was hysterical as well. His greasy, long-winded, and absurd Dogberry still makes me laugh just at the thought or sight of him and people's reactions to him. I love Shakespeare, and this film only heightened my appreciation for his works and their increasingly more common adaptation to film.Bravo to the entire production, and if you haven't seen this movie, do by all means. The best part is when Benedick and Beatrice both stumble upon people in the garden talking about how one loves the other but will never tell of it.

Can you imagine that a reprise of Star Wars in the year 2400 will have the same impact? By then mankind's heart can feel some 800 years of Shakespearean experience. Also Star Trek incorporates in it's episodes his timeless everlasting and universal plays. Branagh bridges the millennium. I feel great about to watch the happy and sunny scenery in a brilliant Tuscan countryside populated with exquisite actors. The opening comes with an landscape overlook taken from a painting and so is the whole movie. You can watch every single shot again and again and you will enjoy it like a precious painting. I love the music done by Patrick Doyle. You can see him play as Balthazar. Listening to his music makes me feel easy and happy again and the movie starts all over again in my mind.

For sure the list would include It's a Wonderful Life, The Godfather, Star Wars, Casablanca, Schindler's List, L.A. Confidential and American Beauty. But my all-time favorite is, and has been for several years, Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing. I've heard the complaints -- that Keanu Reeves is a stiff, that Denzel Washington was miscast, that Michael Keaton's Dogberry is too over the top, cartoonish, Monty Pythonish. But I've seen MAAN 10 or 12 times, and each time my appreciation for it has grown. I guess what it comes down to, for me, is that no movie is perfect. Every film has its flaws. I just really, really like this one -- warts and Keanu and all. I would venture to philosophize that the same is true for anyone's favorite film -- for your favorite. If you like it that much, it's not just in spite of its flaws but because of them. Much Ado is my No. 1 mainly because of the writing (hard to beat Shakespeare) and the acting of the leads (Branagh and the amazing Emma Thompson), but also because of some of the other performances are accidentally perfect. Keanu unwittingly nails his role as the brooding and soulless Don John. Denzel plays Don Pedro as though Don Pedro realizes he's in a movie adaptation of a play by Shakespeare, which seems just perfect to me. And I don't know if Michael Keaton was on drugs or channeling an Elizabethean theater clown or what, but I think if Shakespeare could see Branagh's movie he would say that's the best Dogberry he's ever seen.",Much Ado About Nothing

Branagh's direction and choices create a blend of moods that carefully pull you in to be involved on an emotional level.The cast in this film is a force not to be reckoned with. Performances by Robert Sean Leonard, Emma Thompson, and Kenneth Branagh were outstanding. Keanu Reeves did his job to say the most, but left nothing notable about his character... which was more complex then just being a ""bad, evil, jealous guy""... But it's okay because The Razzie's did him justice. Michael Keaton channels his inner Beatle Juice to give a great performance as the dirty drunk constable.The movie is extremely enjoyable from start to finish... slamming you with comedy and drama... at the same time, Shakespeare style!",Much Ado About Nothing
120,mimochild,Magnificent!,10,7 January 2006,"This film was one of the first Shakespeare pieces I ever saw, and I'm glad it was because it inspired me to watch, and see more. I have recently studied Much Ado About Nothing, and I cannot see any major plot points which Branagh has missed that are needed at all. I believe the cast did brilliantly, especially Michaela Keaton in the role of Dogberry, and Ben Elton as Verges. They made me laugh every time they were on the screen, though Dogberry was quite confusing at first I admit! The character of Borachio was represented exactly how I would have imagined, including the rather English accent. The best casting though, I have to say, is Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh as Beatrice and Benedick. their scenes were acted excellently and the ""merry war"" amusing every time.",Much Ado About Nothing
121,MadCelt,Awesome,10,30 September 1998,"I have watched Much Ado About nothing over and over, and still cannot get enough. The Actors are outstanding, both in their vocal, and their physical energy. The Cast was outstanding. Kenneth Branagh made an excellent decision with the lines he omitted from the script. The main idea of the script is still there, without the useless info. I am in the cast of Much Ado About Nothing at my college, and found that this movie was an excellent reference point to learn moods etc....",Much Ado About Nothing
122,kaylun,A flood of emotions presented by a great cast!,10,30 January 1999,"Being a lover of Shakespeare, I HAD to watch this movie.  In watching, I found the perfect combination of actors (all actors, not just the leads!) to pull off the high array of emotions.  For anyone who protests in misunderstanding Shakespeare, this movie is a must!  In a few short minutes, one forgets that the speech is hundreds of years old.Directing, cinematography, and acting - all are superb!  A great adaptation to the screen by Branagh.  Bravo!",Much Ado About Nothing
123,TheGenie,Outstanding Shakespeare film adaptation,10,24 July 1999,One of the best film adaptations of a Shakespeare play I've seen. Probably the best of one of the comedies. This one's worth many repeated viewings. Couldn't find a DD 5.1 soundtrack on the DVD as promised though. The 2.0 sound was still quite good.,Much Ado About Nothing
124,knitwit,Wonderful - except for the nudity.,7,27 July 2002,"This movie would have gotten a ""10"" from us except for the Hollywood obsession with nudity.  Shakespeare managed to tell wonderful stories without it but Kenneth Branagh cannot!  The opening sequence shows nude bathers, which is totally unnecessary for the plot, and there is another ""love"" scene that could have been written around by anyone with some skill. (Shakespeare managed it!)The rest of the movie is wonderful.  The costumes, the scenery, the acting is all very engaging. My little kids (who know when to look away) have learned to love Shakespeare partly because of this (otherwise) terrific film.  They have no problem following the language since the story is so well done.",Much Ado About Nothing
125,Tolipan,Shakespeare at his best,9,18 September 2000,"This is one of the best representations of Shakespeare in movies.Nigel Hawthorne, Ben Kingsley and the rest of the cast are perfect. The humor is wonderful and the text is delightful as expected from Shakespeare.",Much Ado About Nothing
126,jtruchsess,A masterpiece,10,1 April 2001,"Perfect in every respect: casting, performances, sets and location, and its adaptation of Shakespeare. Michael Keaton is brilliant. There's humor, drama, love, and of course commentary on the human condition. The final scene never fails to make me cry (with happiness) no matter how many times I watch it.",Much Ado About Nothing
127,cjeppson,So close to perfection,9,1 November 2001,"I absolutely adore this movie.  Even Keanu Reeves couldn't spoil it.  (This is the only movie with him in it that I can stand to watch!)  As a high school drama teacher, I'm constantly looking for ways to make Shakespeare accessible to my students.  This movie really helps them overcome the jokes they don't get and catch the vision of why Shakespeare has lasted all these years.",Much Ado About Nothing
128,nynicks_22,the best flim ever....,10,8 November 2002,"The film was fantastic with all the comedy and romance blend together. The cast was great. Though I have not any prior knowledge about the play, this film allowed me to understand it right away. This is definately the best flim I have ever watched.",Much Ado About Nothing
129,philipp4130,Shakespeare and Branagh at their best,9,27 June 2008,"Much Ado About Nothing has to be my favorite Kenneth Branagh adaptation of Shakespeare, and as it is my favorite Shakespeare comedy I was apprehensive of his work here, but I was not disappointed. Such actors as Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton and Richard Briers round out a great cast including Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, and of course, Kenneth Branagh. The latter three being my favorite with such amazingly hilarious dialogue and scenes, I've never laughed so much to Shakespeare.Branagh and Keaton's characters kept me amused the entire film. The scene in the garden where Don Pedro and Claudio are tricking Benedick into believing Beatrice loves him is one of my favorites! Every time Branagh goes ""Aaahhh!"" and tries to turn it into a bird's cry and the guys in the garden make the bird gesture I crack up. Then Keaton's entire character entertains throughout the tenser moments of the plot to keep things light and remind us this is a comedy. The whole Monty Python-like fake horse bit never grows old, especially when so brilliantly done by Michael Keaton.Overall I absolutely love this film and break it out to cheer me up on bad days.",Much Ado About Nothing
130,lg-57,Gorgeous scenery but misguided casting.,7,25 October 2007,"Much Ado has, at its heart, the falling in love between Beatrice and Benedict. Whilst Brennagh's Benedict has the subtlety and wit born out of experience, Beatrice is feisty by virtue of her nature and not the worldly woman as played by Enmma Thompson. Surely Beatrice is a virginal young woman whose learning and wit has produced a lively though disingenuous woman. Brian Blessed acts like the village idiot instead of a local patrician; one wonders how he has managed to hang on to his fortune! Kate Beckinsale as Hero produces a fine performance which is both restrained and virginal. The best is without doubt the wonderful Tuscan scenery which is lovingly filmed and must be seen as the star of this flawed performance.",Much Ado About Nothing
131,oliver-356,"Good movie, ruined by certain moments",5,23 December 2007,"Overall a good version of the Shakespearian romantic comedy, but it lets itself down in places. The Dogberry scenes were awful, Keaton is probably the worst type of actor for that role-he was just plain stupid. The character's word confusions, and all of Shakespeare's intended humour was lost. Also Robert Sean Leonard's portrayal of Claudio was relatively poor, some of the tragedy scenes were unintentionally funny! However The duo of Benedick and Beatrice held the piece together, aided, surprisingly, by Reeves as Don John. The movie is a good introduction to the play, however there are better versions out there.",Much Ado About Nothing
132,raye-3,One of the best Shakespearean screen adaptations ever.,8,23 February 2003,"A brilliant screenplay, and Branagh and Thompson are marvelous.  Keaton's performance as the Falstaffian Constable Dogberry is hilarious, even if it does remind one a little too much of ""Beetlejuice"". The weakness of this movie, however was in the casting.  Denzel Washington will never be able to pull of a Shakespearean role.  Even his theatrical weakness could never rival that of Keanu Reeves.  When will casting directors realize that the scope of Keanu Reeves' acting ability is unalterably limited to Ted Logan of ""Bill and Ted"" fame?  Listening to Reeves recite Shakespeare is roughly equivalent to driving ice-picks through one's ear drums.With this caveat in mind, imagine how stellar Branagh and Thompson must've been to rescue this film.",Much Ado About Nothing
133,katiecanty,This film is the type people watch when they need an uplifting of spirits.,10,13 April 2003,"Much Ado About Nothing is a wonderful adaptation of an equally wonderful play.  The film is brilliantly cast and directed.  This film is the type people watch when they need an uplifting of spirits.  The costumes, the setting, and the actors are beautiful in appearance and style.  What I enjoyed most was that I could relax and enjoy the film without worry of understanding every tiny Shakespearean joke or hidden reference.  The cast obviously understood the script and scenes, which allowed them to set the tone so that the audience could enjoy the film as a whole, instead of feeling the burden of dissecting each moment.  This is my favorite film adaptation of a Shakespearean play to date and my favorite role for Kenneth Branagh (I enjoyed it even more than Henry V.)",Much Ado About Nothing
134,Antistatic,Favorite Shakespeare Movie,10,29 December 2003,"This is my favorite screen adaptation of Shakespeare's plays!  I find it very easy to understand, so much so that I once showed it to a class of 2nd graders (approx. age 8) who had indoor recess. Almost all of them understood it and LOVED it. Most of them chose to continue watching it during recess the next three days instead of playing games! It makes the Shakespearean dialogue understandable by the good interpretation, not by changing the wording. The set is quite beautiful.Kenneth Brannagh (as Benedick) and Emma Thompson (as Beatrice) deliver their lines with cutting wit and the love/hate passionate chemistry that develops between them is quite electric. Michael Keaton does an exceptional and very funny performance of the comedic (and insane?) character of Dogberry. Keaton's drunken (and foreign?) accent is a bit hard to understand at first, however. Keanu Reeves delivers a believable performance as the bad guy, Don John. Denzel Washington fits as Don Pedro, the close friend/sidekick for the character Benedick (Brannagh), regardless of his skin color. I was quite taken by Robert Sean Leonard as Count Claudio, the lover of Hero (Kate Beckinsale). You might remember Leonard from ""Dead Poet's Society"".If you have had difficulty understanding Shakespeare before, give this one a try. If you already appreciate Shakespeare, there's a good chance you'll really like this one!",Much Ado About Nothing
135,jkaycashion,Just Lovely!!,10,3 November 2018,"My dad and I enjoy this movie so much. We have watched it many times over the years. The pace is quick, but keeping up is half the fun! Funny and witty and such a joy to watch!",Much Ado About Nothing
136,rcori4,Well done job except for Keanu Reeves,8,8 April 2005,"I had to give this an 8 because i feel that it is a wonderful adaptation done by Branagh, However the casting of Keanu Reeves was definitely the wrong move i cringe every time he opens his mouth to speak he's not fit for Shakespeare. A little harsh..maybe but i am an avid lover of Shakespeare and i think he definitely brought the movie down, there was just something about the way he spoke the lines and acted the part that was just wrong. As for Emma & Kenneth what an amazing job they did and such chemistry, they make performing and speaking Shakespeare seem so effortless and natural I would have loved to give this movie a 9 or even a 10 but like i said Keanu Reeves messed it up for the rest.",Much Ado About Nothing
137,ingootibooti,Characters and how they were played,8,26 February 2005,"I have to say, I am a huge Shakespeare freak! And I really loved this movie, up until the whole Keannu Reeves thing, and the frolicking through the fountain lol. I think however, as far as Don Joh goes Reeves did show that he was a compassionate person, which is what Shakespeare intended I think. I mean, you're supposed to think that he would be an awesome and compassionate loving person but the whole brother thing is in his way. He def could've done better and I absolutely hated it, but to give him the benefit of the doubt, it's a hard part to play. As far as when they find out that they love each other and frolic around, the movie so could've gonk around that. I mean, the fountain dancing part was over the top lol. But I absolutely adored the way that Branagh played Benedick and wouldn't have liked it any other way",Much Ado About Nothing
138,quasardrake,Highly entertaining,9,22 January 2016,"A very entertaining version of the play. Marvelous performances all around. Reminds you of just WHY Denzel Washington deserves both the love of audiences and fans, and an Academy Award. Kenneth Branagh is an actor one either likes or dislikes, and I happen to like him. He is well matched here with Emma Thompson. Both are excellent in the principle roles of Benedick(the Bard's spelling) and Beatrice. The supporting cast is outstanding. I particularly like the marvelous Brian Blessed as Hero's uncle Antonio. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly good as the villainous Don Jon; it is possibly one of his very best screen performances. Robert Sean Leonard is good but not quite up to the others as Claudio, and Kate Beckinsale is somewhat better as the slandered maiden named Hero. Michael Keaton is hilarious as the constable whose language is so filled with circumlocutions that no one can understand him.This Branagh Shakespearean production is considerably more edited for length than ""Hamlet"" or ""Henry V"", with a run time of just under two hours, which is just about right for most movie audiences. The trimming is judiciously done and the play hangs together very well, with the main plot points largely intact. His direction is crisp and the staging is very good. The language is not too difficult to follow, despite the fact that it was not modernized. I found this film vastly entertaining and particularly enjoyed Denzel Washington in it. Locations are beautiful and costumes attractive. I found almost nothing to complain about by the end, despite doubting whether Keanu Reeves would hold up in his role. He is fine. Overall this is a wonderful film, a good introduction to the Bard for younger audiences(though they may wish to review the plot beforehand), and a most pleasant choice for someone looking for a romantic comedy for a date night. I found it just delightful.",Much Ado About Nothing
139,Amore22,"Light hearted, beautiful, and witty.",10,8 November 2005,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Kenneth Branaugh does an amazing job directing this film, as well as acting in it. The film is light & frothy, beautifully lit, and (mostly) extremely well cast, especially all the Brits. (Emma Thompson is wonderful, Robert Sean Leonard also does a great job, but I could do without Keanu Reeves). I only wish Branaugh & Thompson hadn't broken up, but as time goes on, it seems less and less important.It is amazing to think that this play was written so long ago and yet holds up so beautifully. Also incredible is the fact that the final shot of the cast singing ""Hey, Nonny, Nonny"" was done in one take. It's a wonderful scene; the only problem is that the song is so catchy, it's hard to stop singing it. I've watched that finale over and over, and I've yet to tire of it.",Much Ado About Nothing
140,mel_2,Great version of Shakespeare's play.,10,14 November 2006,"I am trying my hardest to be neutral and critical of this movie for the sake of writing this review but let's face it, I am completely in love.Kenneth Branagh does Shakespeare better than anyone else. Much Ado About Nothing is a playful, merry movie that perfectly matches the witty script of Shakespeare's. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson shine in their roles as the bickering Benedick and Beatrice; the most important part of the movie. The love story of Hero and Claudio, though sweet, is somewhat shadowed by their performance. I definitely recommend this film to anyone. (And believe me, anyone. I saw a class of Shakespeare-bored techapologies for the stereotyping-- students herded into a room to watch it, and they came out cheerfully talking about it.)",Much Ado About Nothing
141,oakley-10,It's the anti-MTV,10,18 August 2005,"A wonderful movie. I was reminded how wonderful last week when I had the pleasure of visiting the villa Vignamaggio in Tuscany where it was filmed.I am a great lover of Shakespeare, but even if I weren't, I would love this movie. The heat and richness of Tuscany are faithfully conveyed in the cinematographer's efforts, and the motion of the story is incredibly faithful.It's a lovely love story and a busy romp.The scene with the maidens in the baths is alone worth the price of admission. It makes you believe that youth is possible and innocence worthwhile. It's the anti-MTV.I even forgive the stilted diction of Keanu Reeves, who just looks so right as a don Juan.",Much Ado About Nothing
142,ageiger2,A lively interpretation under Kenneth's guise,8,12 September 2005,"A mixed celebrity cast, under the hand of director/actor/thespian Kenneth Branagh, animates this partially dark comedic tale with a more positive emphasis. A wide variety of people help to give complexity to the roles, such as veterans Emma Thompson and Branagh playing the witty dueling would-be lovers Beatrice and Benedick, in contrast to the meddling Reeves as Don John. Michael Keaton asserts his character of Dogberry of the Watch and carries over a fragment of the ghost of Beetlejuice.True devotees of Shakespeare will revel in the Beatrice/Benedick story-within-the-story, but may cringe at Keanu's interpretation of Don John, as well as Denzel Washington portraying a dashing Don Pedro, eager to woo as well as curse the lady Hero.The upbeat tempo established by Thompson and Branagh takes away the sinister aspect of Keanu's character, and offers the viewer a happy ending, which we have come to expect out of the word 'comedy', but ultimately detracts from the underlying drama that Shakespeare was famous for.Those who are basically unfamiliar with the bard will at least delight in the scenery, the tone of the acting, and of course, the complexity of the courtier's political and romantic life.",Much Ado About Nothing

144,wilddestiny,"Very , very good film",9,21 January 2007,"I loved the movie!! We watched it in my English class and I have to admit it is a very well done and well acted film. I thought Emma Thompson as Beatrice was particularly brilliant, but then I think everybody thought that anyway....i was trying very hard not to cry at the ending ( even though it IS happy ) ! All the actors were brilliant - except I think the actor who played Claudio did not quite live up to the rest of them, and neither did Keanu Reeves, but nevertheless their performances were not at all bad.The sex scene...is that even in the play?! I don't think it actually is is it? (appologies if it is) Well yes that was quite awkward since it is a class of 30 people and we are 14 year olds....I think the only scene they could have done without is the scene where Beatrice is on the swing and Benedick is jumping around in that fountain and they are faded in.....so cheesy.....my friend and I burst out laughing.....I mean. If you find out someone is in love with you, you don't go splashing about in a fountain like a lunatic! I found it to be a very warm and funny film. I actually loved that song they kept playing even though quite a few people have expressed their dislike of it..I'll give it 9/10 (yes i really AM knocking off one just for the swing and fountain scene!!)",Much Ado About Nothing
145,squidgemolloy,Enjoyable and really captures the Shakespearean feel,7,18 April 2017,I think this was an enjoyable film that you should watch if you enjoy Shakespeare and his work. The director included a range of quotes from the play and the characters showed their personalities and emotion which really added to the drama. It had me hooked from beginning to end and having already read Much Ado About Nothing it was very interesting to see how much a difference it was when see the words shown through actors. My favourite parts were when the characters were having conversation using Shakespearean language but with the knowledge of English and the characters facial expressions you could still understand and be memorized by it. I am happy with film and the only negative thing I have to say about it is the tendency for the characters to go over the top with there expressions especially when Claudio was looking trying to give the look of sadness and heartbreak because it came across more like he was having indigestion. Apart from this the actors were great and excelled their roles perfectly.,Much Ado About Nothing
146,shaunruddick,Good.,6,20 April 2017,"I think this is a good interpretation of the Shakespeare play, and it makes the story line easy to follow because you can understand what the characters mean by how the actors say it. I'd recommend it as good to watch if you're trying to read the play but don't know what the Elizabethan English means. Good. Personally, I find it rather boring, but if you like Shakespeare and romance things like this, then you will like this, I'm sure.",Much Ado About Nothing
147,ciaran-03078,Review of much ado about nothing 1993,8,21 April 2017,Much ado about nothing is a love story with ups and downs all the way to the final scene this is a tale from Shakespeare from love to marriage to death to arise. Again much ado about nothing is a beautiful tell but like all good films there's a villain this villain attempts to break up love by making disgusting allegations turning love upside down. This book later adapted to a film in 1993 and later 2012 many books that were adapted to films change parts and add in scenes that may not make sense to the story. But this film is an exception The film is basically word for word the book with slight bits of comedy to Adapt it to modern society .In conclusion this film is a good watch I would still say the book is better than the film because reading the story you can adapt the film in your head and use your imagination which in my opinion better to understand,Much Ado About Nothing
148,lonnacob,...,7,23 April 2017,"The film represented the play quite well because of how they spoke, what they wore and how they managed to include the soliloquies, if it didn't have the soliloquies it is even harder to understand. As much as I think the actors played their roles well and I think it was done well there are moments when it is hard to understand, but it may just be how they spoke back then is a difficult 'language' to understand.",Much Ado About Nothing
149,broadwaybaby717,Oh Keanu. If only you weren't in this perfect film.,9,13 December 2006,"OK people. I love this movie; it has been my favorite since I was 10 years old. I am also a drama major, have been in numerous Shakespeare productions, and have cut Shakespeare plays myself for directing. I am writing a term paper on this movie. Kenneth did an unbelievable job at this movie. Yes, he did cut many, many lines as the woman before me stated, but he did so brilliantly. Watch the scene between Beatrice and Benedict at the beginning and you will realize that this movie kept everything juicy, nothing stale. Kenneth took certain lines (none to be spoiled here!) and gave them a completely new, fresh meaning that did not detract from the original intent! Branagh's casting list reads as a ""Who's talented"" in Hollywood and beyond, with his now ex-wife Emma Thompson playing deliciously opposite him as Beatrice; Robert Sean Leonard (who has since learned much about acting and is fantastic in the series House, MD.) and Kate Beckinsale as the sweet, if not too interesting Claudio and Hero; Denzel is princely as can be, I personally find objections against him to be petty, he knows how to do Shakespeare naturally, without pretensions behind the language. As Leonato and his brother are staples Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, both of whom Branagh uses in almost all if not every film he makes. The supporting cast was fantastic, Michael Keaton as Dogberry is one of the most perfect performances ever seen, and the only odd choice is, as stated before, Keanu. Dear god Keanu sucks. The lack of emotion in his voice, whether he is melancholy or not is appalling. You really wonder how this man was casted. Oh well, he really might be the only short-coming of the film, his scenes are almost unbearable. Overall, delight yourself in the gorgeous cinematic experience, with a perfect score, wonderfully new ways of looking at Shakespeare, and some truly perfect acting.",Much Ado About Nothing

I laughed aloud on many occasions, and was surprised that I could, since in seeing other movies based on Shakespeare I was confused, and had no idea what was going on.I think that it is a great movie with wonderful actors and i think it is a very well-done movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to watch a well-done, easy to understand and accurate Shapespeare movie.",Much Ado About Nothing
