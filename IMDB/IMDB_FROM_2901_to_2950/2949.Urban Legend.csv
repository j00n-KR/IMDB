0,Leofwine_draca,A good guess-the-killer slasher movie,6,23 November 2016,"Just another of the glut of teen slashers following in the wake of SCREAM, this one is much more entertaining than I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. For a start, the acting is better, and plus there is a higher gore content. URBAN LEGEND, while obeying all of the most copied clichés in the genre (particularly the jump scene when someone is bumped into, this happens five or six times in the film), still manages to be quite entertaining, in a funny-bad way.For a start, the cast is better than usual. While the main cast members are the fresh-faced, flawless beauties that we've all come to know and hate, even they aren't too bad. Alicia Witt is boring in the title role, while Jared Leto just needs to look pretty and run around a bit. The best actor of the bunch is Joshua Jackson, who is likable as the class joker, although unfortunately he isn't in the film for very long. John Neville fills the shoes of the headmaster well enough, while Robert Englund enjoys his small role as a suspicious college lecturer. Brad Dourif also has a small, scene-stealing cameo appearance as a stuttering garage attendant.The film benefits from a clever, tricky opening murder with a twist that I didn't see coming. After this excellent scene though, it just goes downhill, as to be expected. Bland college life is punctuated by some brutal murders, most of which are mildly clever and diverting, although horrendously contrived. The blood flows quite freely in these scenes, although they aren't really all that gory, apart from an excellent moment when John Neville is run over by a car and crushed into a row of spikes. This is the best murder of them all.The identity of the murderer is kept secret right up until the end, so it's quite fun playing guess the killer. However the fact that the killer wears a giant parka and carries an axe is very clichéd and the ending of the film is just plain stupid, with the killer coming back time after time after time for one last chill. These drawn out endings are really grating after a while, and you just want the film to end, not go on longer. While URBAN LEGEND isn't brilliant by a long way, it's a lot better than I thought it would be (due to all the negative comments heard on release). If you're a slasher fan then its an above average example of the genre, if not, it's a good film to watch with friends and to play guess the killer with. I did, and I had a lot of fun.",Urban Legend
1,SnoopyStyle,Fine horror about horror clichés,6,12 August 2014,"This movie opens with Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) driving in a rainy night and gets killed by an ax killer hiding in her backseat. At Pendleton University in New England, Professor William Wexler (Robert Englund) teaches a class about urban legends. Paul Gardener (Jared Leto) writes about Mancini in the school paper enraging dean Adams (John Neville) and security guard Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine). Mancini and Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) were high school cheerleader co-captains. Then Damon Brooks (Joshua Jackson) is killed while he's with Natalie but his body goes missing. She suspects the killer is focused on her. Her goth roommate Tosh Guaneri (Danielle Harris) gets killed. She and her friends Brenda Bates (Rebecca Gayheart), Parker Riley (Michael Rosenbaum) and Sasha Thomas (Tara Reid) are stalked by the killer. Also there's a weird janitor (Julian Richings).This is a functional horror although it's nothing terribly original. In fact, the whole movie is about all the horror clichés. It plays it seriously. The cast is full of good young photogenic actors. It's a routine slasher movie and nothing more. Unlike other films, this does lack a sense of humor.",Urban Legend
2,kosmasp,Burying the ex/hatchet,8,3 October 2021,"This was ripe for a rewatch and I remembered it fondly. Not just because I was fond of the beautiful people in front of the screen, but because I liked the murder mystery horror of it all. This was not being received well at the time of its release - Scream may have had something to do with it. Which is kind of funny, because Scream was probably responsible for this being made in the first place.But while Scream was making fun of horror movies (in a very good way mind you), this was more a straight horror movie kind of deal. That being said, it is still tongue in cheek in more than one place. Be it the beginning (which also works as a mini short movie if you want to see it that way) or the end - the very last one of them ... although the second one can be almost seen as fun stab (smash?) at horror conventions too.So while the movie is being honest and ""real"", it does not mean it does not have its moments of fun. Well fun might not be the right word for some, but I believe most understand what I'm saying here.Add to that a fantastic cast (Jared Leto? Woah - had totally forgotten about him being in it) and you have a clear winner - at least in my book. The deaths are not as bloody as I remembered and there are deleted scenes in the trailer that are being talked about in the audio commetary - curious to see what else was cut from the movie.One thing that you have to do for sure: suspend your disbelief. I don't think one can guess from the start where this is heading, but it is the journey nonetheless that is important. A journey made up of many things convenient and actually not really something anyone could plan happening ... but again, do not think too much about it, just go with the flow ... and what a flow it is!",Urban Legend
3,lee_eisenberg,the stuff that legends are made of,5,9 March 2007,"""Urban Legend"" is nothing special. Mostly, it's just another movie about a psycho killer targeting a bunch of twenty-somethings. The whole part about the killings being based on urban legends - for the uninitiated, those are stories such as the boy and girl who drive off with the killer's hook hanging onto their car door - was the main interesting part. Otherwise, there's little that we haven't seen in better movies (namely ""Scream""). Still, it's always a pleasure to sit down and watch a movie like this and wonder whether or not any of these urban legends could ever come true.All in all, an OK way to pass time. Starring Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, John Neville (aka Baron Munchausen), Natasha Gregson-Wagner (Natalie Wood's daughter), Robert Englund and Brad Dourif.PS: ""Urban Legend"" was one of three really profitable movies in autumn, 1998, along with ""Rush Hour"" and ""The Waterboy"". A slasher movie, a buddy comedy, and a football comedy. Hmmm...",Urban Legend
4,Woodyanders,Sometimes those urban legends are actually real,8,11 October 2016,"A group of college students find themselves the victims of a vicious killer who an obsession with popular urban legends. It's up to the scared, yet intrepid Natalie Simon (a spunky and appealing performance by Alicia Witt) to figure out what's going on before it's too late.Director Jamie Banks keeps the engrossing story moving along at a snappy pace, builds a reasonable amount of tension, stages the murder set pieces with rip-snorting panache, and delivers a satisfying serving of gore. (However, Banks does go a tad overboard with the cheesy fake scares.) Silvio Horta's clever script not only offers a refreshing tweaking of the final girl by making Natalie someone who has a dark history and hence isn't entirely innocent, but also offers another welcome departure from the slasher norm by having the psycho turn out to be a vengeful woman with a valid beef against Natalie that elicits the viewer's sympathy. The solid acting by the capable cast keeps this picture humming: Jared Leto as eager and unscrupulous reporter Paul Gardener, Rebecca Gayheart as Natalie's perky gal pal Brenda Bates, Michael Rosenbaum as the jerky Parker Riley, Joshua Jackson as the jerky Damon Brooks, Loretta Devine as sassy security guard Reese Wilson, Tara Reid as brash disc jockey Sasha Thomas, Robert Englund as the creepy Professor William Wexler, Danielle Harris as moody Goth slut Tosh Guaneri, and Natasha Gregson Wagner as the doomed Michelle Mancini. Brad Dourif has a cool uncredited role as sinister stuttering gas station attendant Michael McDonnell. Christopher Young's spirited shivery score hits the shuddery spot. The glossy cinematography by James Chressanthis makes impressive use of the widescreen format as well as boasts all these breathtaking gliding crane shots. A fun fright flick.",Urban Legend
5,BA_Harrison,"A silly-but-fun, post-Scream slasher.",6,1 September 2009,"One of the many slick teen slashers featuring an impossibly photogenic cast to follow in the wake of Scream, Urban Legend sees a crazed killer at a college staging an elaborate series of murders based on popular contemporary folklore.This ridiculously impractical modus operandi relies heavily on sheer coincidence for success, and inevitably, the resultant film is highly preposterous. Urban Legend's makers are, without a doubt, only too well aware of this fact, but soldier on regardless, relying on the probability that their target audience (indiscriminate teens) will be having too much fun to care (or even notice).And for the most part, the gamble seems to pay off—the eye candy cast (Jared Leto, Joshua Jackson and Michael Rosembaum for the girls; Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Danielle Harris and Tara Reid for the guys), enjoyable mechanical scares, frivolous in-jokes, and well handled action help detract from the general silliness, and director Jamie Blanks keeps things whipping along at a brisk enough pace to ensure that there's little opportunity to dissect the material and pose awkward questions (at least until the film has finished).It had been up to me, however, I'd have ramped up the violence (the film is surprisingly unbloody) and thrown in some gratuitous nudity in order to play it safe, for things do get EXTREMELY daft towards the end, and the slasher fans I know are always more forgiving if there's loads of blood 'n' guts and a few boobies on display (surely Reid could have been talked into getting them out for the lads).",Urban Legend
6,Quinoa1984,Nothing special,5,23 September 2000,"This is your typical (not well made) horror film with screaming girls, slashings and a killer who is a surprise to everyone (oooo).  Story isn't that bad though (Urban legends, based on true stories, happen to teens in a school), but it is executed so badly it makes the killing scene in Blood Simple look like the work of Jack Kevorkian.  Just another not to great horror film in a sea of death.  Only scene worth watching is the dog in the microwave scene (very cringy).  C",Urban Legend
7,BandSAboutMovies,Better than the other 90's slashers,6,1 September 2020,"Of all the 90's and 00's sequels we've covered this week, I'd say the first two Urban Legend films were the best. Admittedly, that's a low bar to trip over. But at their heart, they have more in common with the giallo than making fun of the formula of slashers.I have a fondness for urban legends, as I was obsessed by the books of folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand, from whom I learned that so many of the stories that came by way of a friend of a friend weren't true and merely our way of moving legends of the past into the modern era.This film was written by the late Silvio Horta, who was still working as a perfume spritzer at Nordstrom while he was trying to get into Hollywood. He'd eventually be the head writer and executive producer on Ugly Betty, the American version of the telenovela Yo Soy Betty, La Fea.The film starts with the ""The Killer In the Backseat"" coming true as Michelle (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is murdered, despite the best efforts of a Brad Dourif cameo as he tries to warn her. While that's happening, Paul (Jared Leto), Parker (Michael Rosenbaum), Natalie (Alicia Witt) and Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) are discussing a variant of the ""Hatchet Man,"" which in this movie is all about a series of murders that happened in their school's Stanley Hall.Michelle's murder is quickly hushed up by Dean Adams (John Neville, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen) and security officer Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine), Damon (Joshua Jackson) tries to console Natalie, who is disturbed by the murders, but after she rejects his attempt to aardvarking, he's killed outside the car. All she knows is that he never comes back, just like ""The Boyfriend's Death.""Danielle Harris shows up as Natalie's roommate Tosh, who spends much of the movie flimp-flopping before she's murdered and a note is left behind, which is ""The Roommate's Death."" That's when Natalie tells Brenda that Michelle and she were once close, but caused an accident after driving without their headlights and chasing the first person who flashed their brights - a long-standing ""gang initiation"" urban legend. while that's happening, Paul discovers that Stanley Hall was real and only one person survived: Professor Wexler (Robert Englund), who has already spoke about urban legends with the students, showing them how the Pop Rocks and soda story didn't murder Little Mikey.After ""The Slasher Under the Car"" takes out the dean - oh yes, I forgot ""Bloody Mary"" was used as well - we also get the ""Love Rollercoaster"" death story (as Tara Reid's character Sasha is murdered while doing her radio show), ""The Microwaved Pet"" and stories of kidneys being stolen while their owner is still alive. By the end, the murders in this movie have taken on a life of their own and thus, become urban legend.Director Jamie Blanks wanted to make I Know What You Did Last Summer that he directed a mock trailer for the project. After losing out, he made this film as well as Valentine, which is another very, very late to the game slasher that is way better than you'd think. He also made the remake of Long Weekend. It was scored by Christopher Young, who also did the music for The Dorm That Dripped Blood, Hellraiser, Trick or Treat, The Gift, The Grudge, Drag Me to Hell, Sinister and many more movies.If the school in this movie looks familiar, that's because it was also the setting for Killer Party. It's the University of Toronto, in case you were wondering. If you look closely at the Latin motto of the school, it translates as ""The Best Friend Did It,"" which makes sense at the end of this movie, which has a well-done closing.",Urban Legend
8,Coventry,Post-Scream horror garbage,2,12 May 2004,"Even though Wes Craven's Scream wasn't a very good movie itself, it did cause a revival of the long-dead teen-slasher films. One of the most annoying trends in cinema ever, since these clones and rip-off's merely are dreadfully uninspired excuses to show attractive girls screaming. Every once and a while, a reasonable effort comes out of this (like `Cherry Falls' or `Final Destination') but the majority are just a waste of time (`I know what you did last Summer', `Bloody Murder' ). Urban Legend also surely belongs in this last category, although it could have been better. The idea of mixing urban legends into a horror tale to itself is far from bad, yet the execution is downright lousy! Perhaps it would have been better if they focused on a slightly more solid script, but then againperhaps not! We'll never know and, frankly, I don't want to. Fact is that this piece of junk only has one good moment, near the beginning, with a small (uncredited) role of Brad Dourif. Hardly worth a viewing, is it? Urban Legend isn't gory at all and there's no nudity (at least the 80's slashers showed some ravishing meat) so why would you even consider watching it? I'm sure you got better things to do than seeing how the careers of former `Beverly Hills 90210' and `Dawson's Creek' stars evolve in the wrong direction?",Urban Legend
9,Theo Robertson,A Failure,4,22 March 2004,"Ah yes urban legends a folklore story that is supposedly true . An example would be boy asks girl out on date , she accepts so just to be ready for anything the boy pops into the drugstore to buy some condoms from the man working in there . He turns up at the girls door step later that evening , knocks on the door , the girl`s father answers and the boy realises the man in the drugstore is the girls father ! Or how about this one : Man is in court on Monday looking at three months in the big house so he decides to make the most of his last weekend , gets hidously drunk and on leaving the pub bangs into some old geezer on the street "" Watch where you`re going you old b*stard "" the man says staggering off into the night . Monday arrives and the man is in the court , the judge enters the court room and to the man`s horror he realises the judge is the old b*stard he bumped into at the weekend and the three months in the state holiday camp suddenly becomes twelve months in a maximum security prisonI could use many other examples of urban legend . They`re always supposed to be true but they fall apart when you stop to examine them , usually down to the high level of coincidence involved . This is the problem with the movie titled URBAN LEGEND since there`s a bit too much coincidence involved , and being a slasher flick we`re treated to stereotypical horny teenagers who are totally dumb . For example when someone thinks they know who the murderer is they don`t thinking of standing beside a nearby crowd of people and screaming "" I know who the murderer is "" they run away in the opposite direction which contains a lonely woodland where they`ll be killed by an axe weilding murderer , in other words the victims have only got themselves to blame for not screamingAs you can guess I didn`t think much of URBAN LEGEND , it`s lazily written , formulaic and riddled with plot holes that really don`t bare thinking about ( Especially in the last 20 minutes which becomes totally ridiculous ) and doesn`t have the post modernist feel that made SCREAM just about passable . There was something else very annoying and that was the amount of scenes with strobe lighting that gave me a severe headache . Hopefully we`ll see strobe lighting abolished in movies along with nutters running around chopping up teenagers",Urban Legend
10,Scarecrow-88,Urban Legend,5,23 November 2006,"One night ""Urban Legend"" was being shown(cut, mind you)on ABC Family's ""13 Days of Halloween"" late at night as I passed by the living room with my wife watching. It put an interest to see it and I found it at a decent price so I said to myself I'd give it a shot.""Urban Legend"", as you should know, is part of that cycle of films that spurned successfully from the huge popularity of Wes Craven's SCREAM. This one is pretty silly, but far more entertaining than it should be. Quality camera-work and craftsmanship try to make-up for a screenplay which asks a lot from our viewer. We are supposed to accept the fact that this serial killer can move from one location to another in quick speed(with some of the deaths desiring elaborate planning and cunning)..and in a torrent rain-storm that would rival anyone having to stage death traps at just the right moment with success.Alicia Witt is the heroine who knew the murdered Natasha Gregson Wagner from High School. Around her are friends dying in different ways by a psychopath wearing a huge coat with a fur head covering that provides us with no way of seeing the killer's face. The gimmick of this slasher flick is that people are dying according to elaborately staged Urban Legends. Witt will turn to college-newspaper journalist Jared Leto for help.The film is loaded with the faces of youth television stars such as Joshua Jackson, Michael Rosenbaum & also features the likes of Robert Englund(as a professor of folklore), John Neville(as the college dean), scene-stealing Loretta Devine(as the security guard modeling herself after blaxploitation heroine Pam Grier), Tara Reid(as a radio-host who looks great with meat on her bones), & Rebecca Gayheart(as Witt's best friend).",Urban Legend
11,preppy-3,Better than average but falls apart at the end,6,20 July 2007,"At a college in New England there's a serial killer who's killing people and using urban legends as a method. He seems to be targeting Natalie (Alicia Witt) and her friends...but why? And who is it?Well-done and very good addition to the slasher film genre. It starts right off with a scary and atmospheric murder (which also makes good use of Bonnie Tyler's ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"") and keeps getting better. They have some good acting (Witt and Rebecca Gayheart are just great), a pretty fun script (the basic idea itself is not bad) and some very well-done murders (Danielle Harris' was a highlight). Also it was fun to see Joshua Jackson from ""Dawson's Creek"" and casting Rober Englund (Freddy Krueger himself) as a teacher was a nice touch. BUT it all falls apart at the end.DEFINITE SPOILERS!!!!! ENDING IS REVEALED!!!!! We find out Rebecca Gayheart is the killer. That's right--a petite woman kills all these people (she was able to overpower Jackson?) and manages to move and hide all the bodies in an abandoned building. Uh huh. Also how does she get a car when Witt is running away at the end? How did she know Witt would end up at the abandoned tower? How did Leto know they were there? Far too many questions. We're also expected to believe that she is shot point-blank, falls out of a tower, gets into a car Leto and Witt are in, goes crashing through a windshield into icy cold waters...and is STILL alive!!!! That's just insulting the audience to a large degree. SPOILERS END!!!!!Also Michael Rosenbaum is lousy and Jared Leto (blue eyes blazing) walks through his role. So this is, at first, a smart and amusing slasher film that completely falls apart during the last half hour. Too bad. I give it a 6 for the opening hour.",Urban Legend
12,poolandrews,"""He's probably shacked up in a hotel room with a girl.. or a guy... or a farm animal."" One of the better post Scream rip-offs...",7,9 July 2007,"Urban Legends starts one dark rainy night as Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) has a close encounter with an axe wielding homicidal maniac hiding in the back of her car... Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) is studying at Pendleton University, after attending Professor Wexler's (Robert Englund) mythology class she lets the annoying Damon (Joshua Jackson) take her out in his car. Unfortunately his motives are of a sexual variety which Natalie doesn't take too kindly to, he steps out of the car to take a whizz when Natalie is attacked by a duffel coated maniac who has murdered Damon. No-one believes her & her friends try to convince her it's Damon playing a practical joke but when her roommate Tosh (Danielle Harris) supposedly commits suicide Natalie knows something sinister is going on, she becomes increasingly irrational as she thinks the killer is after her...This American & French co-production was directed by Jamie Blanks & I happen to think it's maybe the best post Scream (1996) slasher that tries to ride on the success of Wes Craven's flick & the sudden return to popularity of the 80's slasher flick. The script by Silvio Horta which is played pretty straight has the neat gimmick of basing it's on screen kills around urban legends although some of them clearly aren't based on any such thing, the slitting of Natalie's roommates wrists for instance. I thought it was a pretty neat hook which makes Urban Legends stand out just that bit more than the usual slasher, I thought the teenage cast of character's were better than usual as well with a fairly likable set of protagonists. The dialogue is alright, there's a couple of decent red herrings in here to try & confuse you & the inevitable twist ending is rather good without being too predictable. So it's all good news so far but Urban Legends isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination as it's perhaps ten or fifteen minutes too long & there's an absolutely scandalous lack of blood, violence, gore, naked chicks & exploitation. In fact I'd go as far as to say Urban Legends is one of the driest & tamest slashers out there which isn't good as it could have used a couple of really big gory set-piece kills, then again nothings perfect I suppose.Director Blanks does OK, the film has a very elegant & professional look about it. While it's not the most stylish or flashy film ever it's always nice to look at. There's a nice enough atmosphere to the whole thing, the stalk & slash scenes generate some tension on occasion & it tries to throw in a few genuine scares as well. Urban Legends is one of the few films I have on DVD which I actually bothered to listen to the director's commentary & I have to report that the lack of blood & gore was entirely intentional on the filmmakers part. In fact Blanks says there wasn't even a special make-up effects artist on set at any time, I simply don't understand why you would want to make a slasher film & totally ignore the boob & blood potential as surely that's what any fan of the genre is looking for, right? Anyway, forget about any gore as there really isn't any apart from a few after-the-fact dead bodies & an exploded dog in a microwave. The only real disappointing aspect of the film.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 Urban Legends is well made with good production values & has that Hollywood polish about it, this was actually shot at the University of Toronto in Canada. The acting is pretty good, the cast look nice enough both the boys & girls although I'm only really interested the ladies. You know, I hate Dawson's Creek (1998 - 2003) so I was absolutely delighted to see Josuha Jackson not only get killed but killed very, very early on. Tara Reid is suitably attractive enough as the films main looker.Urban Legends may only be another dull slasher to some & if I'm totally honest that's exactly what it is I actually rather liked it, sure the lack of blood & boobs don't help but there was something here that I liked & enjoyed. Followed by two sequels, Urban Legends: Final Cut (2000) & the straight-to-video Urban Legends: Bloody Mary (2005).",Urban Legend
13,utgard14,You Mind Telling Me What the Hell You're On?,5,29 December 2013,"Scream copycat slasher that uses the ""hook"" of having its killings tied into urban legends. The biggest asset Urban Legend has is its cast. Jared Leto, Joshua Jackson, Tara Reid, Alicia Witt, Michael Rosenbaum, Rebecca Gayheart, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Danielle Harris, Loretta Devine, Brad Dourif, and Robert Englund. One of the key differences between the '80s slashers and the post-Scream ones is the former had casts of nobodies, a few of which went on to bigger things, but the latter casts actors who have already established themselves somewhat. It's an enjoyable enough film of its type. Avid fans of slasher films will enjoy it more. To everybody else it will seem like an old car that barely runs but has a nice new paintjob.",Urban Legend

15,zardoz-13,"""Urban Legend"" Should Keep Horror Movie Junkies Squirming.",2,8 February 2008,"The fun of watching creepy slasher movies is to see how many clichés the films can trash without trivializing the conventions of the horror genre. Alfred Hitchcock launched this dreadful but adrenalin-laced genre back in the 1960s with ""Psycho."" ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" epics along with their sanguinary sequels carved out a cinematic niche for themselves in the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, the ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" sagas have pumped fresh plasma into the slasher genre for the 1990s.As axe-wielding, serial-killer, whodunits rate, ""Urban Legend"" takes its cues from ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and features more than enough get-up and gore. Sadly, lacking a credible plot, ""Urban Legend"" adds only a creative stab or two, but never twists the formula enough to distinguish itself. Ultimately, the film relies on the usual quota of clichés, shocks, and cleverly staged homicides to conceal its flaws. Conspicuously missing are the lusty interludes that punctuated ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Sexual activity is confined to the Kama Sutra sex chat of a late-night, campus talk-radio host, and an ""Elvira"" coed who reams out her roommate for walking in on her during sex with her guy. Unlike earlier slashers, ""Urban Legend"" doesn't punish its participants for their carnal urges. Thrill-thriving teens, may salvage a shriek or two, but veteran, old school horror-goers will scoff at the less than legendary treatment that the filmmakers afford their promising premise.Rookie film director Jamie Blanks and novice scribe Silvio Norta had a novel idea. An anonymous homicidal maniac is killing students, faculty, and administrators at Pendleton University, a prestigious New England campus. What sets these killings apart from ordinary homicides is that each slaying reenacts an urban legend. Urban legends are contemporary folklore spread by word-of-mouth that contain a modicum of truth. Alligators prowling the sewers of Manhattan and metal tooth fillings that transmit radio broadcasts exemplify urban legends.Scenarist Silvio Norta's predictable but abrasive 'cry wolf' screenplay paints paranoid college student Natalie (Alicia Witt of TV's ""Cybill"") into a deadly corner. She keeps warning everybody about the serial killer but everybody ignores her. Paul (Jared Leto of ""The Thin Red Line""), a scoop-hungry journalism major, refuses to believe that urban legends would inspire a murderer. Meanwhile, frat boy Parker (Michael Rosenbaum of ""Poolhall Junkies"") exploits Pendleton University's own urban legend. Twenty-five years ago an insane professor slashed the throats of several undergraduates in their dorm. Parker commemorates this heinous occasion with a party. When Paul sees the truth in Natalie's 'cry wolf' stories, the campus security chief (Loretta Divine of ""Dreamgirls"") reminds them that The U.S. News & World Report named Pendleton as the safest campus in New England.""Urban Legend"" sticks closely to the horror formula in most respects. Urban legends like the babysitter who gets harassing phone calls from within her house, axe-murderers waiting in the back seat, and trying to get the car cranked before the lunatic smashes the windshield are skillfully woven into the fabric of the plot. Just about everything spooky happens at night, and everybody has a nasty habit of sneaking up on each other. The killer walks, while the victims run! Not only does Natalie have a tough time convincing her friends about her serial killer, but the filmmakers also have their own problems convincing us that their murderer could commit such crimes.Blanks and Norta imitate rather than renovate the classics. Looking like Nanook of the North, the villain wears an ominous but nondescript fur-lined parka. The serial killer is literally faceless because the hood obscures all facial features. Wisely, the filmmakers have complicated the identity crisis. Just about everybody in ""Urban Legend"" sports an identical parka. Unhappily, their efforts to distract audiences with red herrings about the murderer's identity misfire.""Urban Legend"" opens with an exciting scene set at a back roads gas station on a stormy evening. A college student, Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson of ""Lost Highway"") runs out of fuel. At the gas station, a stuttering attendant (Brad Dourif of ""Dune"") who intends her no harm scares Michelle. As she spins her wheels to get away, the poor guy warns her about a person with an axe in the backseat. Indisputably, ""Urban Legend"" qualifies as both mischievous and mean spirited. The vicious killer wields a razor-sharp axe and enjoys swinging the bloody thing.Director Jamie Blanks choreographs each killing for maximum visual and aural impact. He doesn't really do anything innovative that previous horror directors haven't already done. He gets more mileage out of shocking than scaring. At least five times, he uses the old trick of having somebody grab someone else from off-camera. When he can neither shock nor scare, he resorts to sadism, like the dog in the microwave. Altogether, Blanks is a competent enough technician who never lets the momentum lag in ""Urban Legend."" A capable but unknown cast bolsters the mystery. None have gained a reputation for portraying villains so the baddie is more difficult to spot. Sadly, these characters are too sketchy and stereotypical to win our sympathy. Robert Englund of ""Freddie Krueger"" notoriety raises a few hackles as a suspicious folklore professor with a closet of grisly weapons. ""Waiting to Exhale's"" Loretta Devine excels. She is cast against the grain as Pendleton University's Security Chief. The scene where she practices her gun-wielding speech to an old Pam Grier movies is cute. Nobody can say that ""Urban Legend"" doesn't smash racial stereotypes. Apart from its bizarre premise, ""Urban Legend"" spouts none of the ironic humor that highlighted the ""Scream"" movies.""Urban Legend"" boasts a few surprises, and villain's slide show explanation for murder seems obligatory. Of course, the film leaves itself wide open for a sequel as the antagonist survives several gunshots and a night-time plunge into a deep, icy river. Nevertheless, ""Urban Legend"" should keep horror movie junkies squirming until the next slasher movie unspools.",Urban Legend
16,view_and_review,Sucked,2,29 November 2020,"If you thought ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was dumb, then from the creators of that movie comes more stupidity: ""Urban Legend,"" in which a killer stages all of her kills to look like urban legends.One of the biggest crimes of this movie is the stark stupidity of the police. Well that, and the plot.Let's discuss the plot for a sec. A killer of unknown identity is killing a litany of people all connected to a girl named Natalie (Alicia Witt). All of their deaths are in the form or fashion of one urban legend or another. We find out that Natalie accidentally killed a young man herself by enacting an urban legend as a prank.The plot is really immaterial because everything that occurs is so formulaic and predictable it's mind numbing: right down to the ""twist"" at the end.But if I can digress really quickly to talk about the police work in this dreck. With the first three murders the police weren't even close. It was laughable how pathetic they were. The first girl was axed in her car as the killer waited in the back seat. The police blamed the gas station attendant who was back at the gas station. The second person murdered was a dude who was hung in the woods. There was a car, a rope, broken glass everywhere, and a dead body. The killer (a dainty 110 pound twenty-year-old as we found out) was able to remove all of that, leaving no trace of a crime, before the campus security arrived an hour or two later. The third person killed was a young lady choked to death in her room. The killer, Brenda Bates (Rebecca Gayheart), then cut the girl's wrists to make it look like a suicide. How the police couldn't determine that she was first choked to death is beyond me.The movie was just full of traditional scary movie inconsistencies and absurdities. At the end we got the big reveal that the killer was a friend of Natalie's and that she was doing all of this because Natalie had killed her boyfriend with her urban legend prank. That was all part of your traditional bad guy megalomaniac story telling when the killer explains all of her actions as well as her plans for her now captive hero. Then we got the deus ex machina to come in and save our damsel in distress, but of course the killer had to be stopped more than once because evil never dies the first time. Yeah, this movie sucked.",Urban Legend
17,anaconda-40658,The Original When A Stranger Calls is Far Better.,3,26 November 2015,"Urban Legend (1998): Dir: Jamie Blanks / Cast: Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto, Robert Englund, Tara Reid: Another slasher film out to educate the public on various methods to kill people. It is a film about untrue events that bare probability. It involves the killing of teenagers based upon urban legends. Robert Englund plays a professor who teaches a class on the subject, and his urban legend involving a babysitter receiving threatening phone calls was presented in a superior horror film called When a Stranger Calls with Carol Kane as the sitter. Director Jamie Blanks does a fine job at concealing the killer's identity. It is well made but written as an executioner's handbook. When A Stranger Calls or Halloween have the suspense that this film lacks. We are required to blame the murders on Englund because of his notorious career as Freddy Krueger. Can a guy not get an even break? The young cast wander about aimlessly waiting for their roles to spark life despite the fact that the only thing to spark out of their lives is a very gruesome death. Among the wasted cast are Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart and Jared Leto and their roles consist of running, screaming and being murdered in some fashion that is unfortunately more creative than anything else the film has to offer, which isn't much. Yet another puke fest in all of its gory sick details. Score: 3 / 10",Urban Legend
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Best post-Scream style film,9,18 March 2017,"Following a series of strange murders, a group of students at a college campus set out to investigate the crimes and their seeming connection to the killer when they find out the killer is basing their crimes on urban legends and set out to stop the rampage.This is far better than its reputation would have it. Among the better features here is the fact that back when this movie came out the gimmick of using the deaths based on urban legends allowed for some pretty inventive and original kills. The opening backseat driver decapitation is a great one to open a film on, the dead boyfriend suspended over a fleeing car in the woods offers some rather nice suspense with the killer appearing and continually trying to break into the car and the sex/strangulation misidentification is really cool mainly because the circumstances needed to make it true, from the back-story needed to make sure she shouldn't see anything, the killer gaining access to the room without violent means, and the actual sounds of the incident, are all mixed together and makes a marvelous scene. These here really work nicely due to the way they incorporate the whole mythology of the premise into their stalking and work incredibly well at bringing these together. Other great scenes, where she watches someone in the killers known attire stalk one of her friends in a swimming pool while she is helplessly trying to get her attention or the tense stalking of the DJ in the radio station during the thunderstorm make for some additional tense, thrilling scenes, and the way it works out due to knowing what the killer is dressed like is effective enough. That also leads into the twist about the identity of the killer and how their secret is kept, as the way there are so many different red herrings involved and all of them given good alibis to clear them, so by gaining more clues to their identity, it broadens the suspense by making an extra clue for the people to solve. These here really work nicely for the film as there isn't a whole lot really to dislike here. The main problem with this film is that it was aimed for the masses to consume, so it has a lot of toned-down gore. Many of these killings should've been gorier, and it will probably disappoint many out there looking for a good gory slasher film. It also falls into the realm of those films where they're trying to poke fun of the genre at the same time as trying to scare, and here is one example that having a ton of cheap scares aren't that frightening. What makes it worse is that many of the jokes aren't funny, so it is a bit flat in some places. The pacing is a little off in the first half with all the build-ups to the class and what they all mean, but there's not a whole lot else wrong here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, some alcohol use, a scene with a dog drinking and a brief mild sex scene.",Urban Legend
19,FlashCallahan,Dogs in Microwaves......,7,8 January 2012,"Urban Legend tells the story of a group of college students at a remote New England university.Natalie is an academically-gifted student at the Pendleton University. Natalie and her friends are all involved in the Folklore class being taught by Professor Wexler.Wexler regales his class with urban legends, which include Pendleton's own urban legend about a Psych professor who murdered six students at Stanley Hall 25 years ago.Natalie is the first one to suspect there's a killer on campus, especially after she has ties to all of the victims. First, it's her high school friend, a guy she's in the woods with at night, her roommate...No one, including her friends, Wexler, Dean Adams and security guard, of course, believes her until it's too late and everyone begins to die according to famous urban legends.Natalie believes it's all tied to a dark and horrible secret from her past....After the success of Scream and IKWYDLS, it was inevitable that these films would carry on until they dripped the last bit of profit they could from the genre.This movie was when the genre was beginning to falter just a little, but the film is still breezy, and has a fantastic story to it. It's just a shame that the script wasn't polished up a little, as the ending should have been sorted out.The cast are great and nauseatingly beautiful, and the idea of an urban legend killer has to be up there with Ghostface, It's just the killers rant at the end of the film is so poor, it taints the rest of the film.It's not the performers fault, they are really good, the lines they spout are just too cringe inducing.With references to other films, not just horror, Urban Legend is one of those films you can watch, and then come across it a few years later and forgot who got killed and how.It's a guilty pleasure, good to look at, with some great editing, but the writers should have left out the speech and the fact that a lot of characters spend a lot of time running in the rain.",Urban Legend

Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart and Tara Reid play the three main female students while Michael Rosenbaum, Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson play the main dudes. Robert Englund is on hand as a dubious professor, Julian Richings as a weird maintenance guy, John Neville as the dean and Loretta Devine as campus security.While this is a slickly-made and entertaining late 90's slasher with a stellar cast, it's also hackneyed, cartoony, contrived, over-the-top and unbelievable; the revelation of the killer in the last act is particularly roll-your-eyes. It's also not scary. But, like I said, it's amusing and polished; I also like the NE locations (Toronto area). Alicia Witt plays a strong heroine and it's inexplicable that she didn't become more popular, although she's had steady work ever since.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot at Humber College, Toronto, Ontario, and nearby Trent University with an opening aerial shot of Trinity College School, Port Hope, Ontario.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",Urban Legend

22,The_Void,Maybe even the best post-Scream slasher,7,10 September 2006,"Urban Legend rips off popular nineties horror Scream pretty unashamedly, but even so; this film really isn't bad, and that's high praise indeed coming from someone who usually has an adversity to dull slasher flicks. Like many of the best slasher films, this one has a method to its murders, and that method takes form of the fascinating idea of urban legends. The plot is your basic slasher fare, with a bunch of dumb, but good looking, college kids finding out that there's a killer on campus. Only this killer doesn't kill people any old how, they're all dispatched in the style of the aforementioned urban legends - and includes such ideas as a wet dog being dried in a microwave, and the classic 'kidney heist'. The film is quite annoying, however, as it delivers it's best sequence right at the start and never manages to top, or even match it's opening - which is hugely disappointing.It has to be said that the murders in this film are mostly very well put together, and it's obvious that director Jamie Blanks (who also directed the rubbish 'Valentine') was more interested in the murder scenes than most of the rest of the film - which is fine considering what type of film it is. There's enough suspense generated to keep the audience interested (even though the target audience is the same bunch of moronic teens that star in the film), and there's also a big part of the film dedicated to the idea of red herrings, and just about every single character comes under suspicion at one point. The only problem with this is that while the script is busy making us think that the murderer is any number of characters - it becomes obvious in the end as there is only one person that hasn't come under suspicion yet. The cast is dotted out with a bunch of young actors; along with performances from eighties horror 'icons' Robert Englund and Brad Dourif. It all boils down to a satisfying silly conclusion, and while this is hardly great horror; it's certainly not bad.",Urban Legend
23,mm-39,Disturbing,7,12 July 2001,"My wife likes this film and gave it a 7.  She found it disturbing.  The characters had a early 90's feel to it, it brought back memories when I was at the University, and the director does this in order to make the film unravel like a urban legend from the past.

Rebecca Hayheart gives an outstanding performance as a young girl who has some very dark secrets in her past and has the hots for Paul Gardener and Natralie Simon steals her boyfriend and causes a great deal of problems.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Let's get our slasher on!,6,28 July 2002,"Ah our precious 1990's, so many great things came out of this memorable decade, including a streak of teen slasher films. Let's face it, after the mega success of Scream which opened the doors once again after Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street, we needed a new classic. So naturally all the screen writers who were a bit scared to present their ideas on the table, thanks to Kevin Williamson, the clever writer of Scream and Dawson's Creek. After that, every teen slasher film was released: the Scream sequels, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. But we didn't stop at that, we were now presented with Urban Legend.The film begins on a dark and stormy night as college student Michelle Mancini realizes she is near empty while driving in her car. There's someone in the back seat as Michelle drives, a figure in a dark coat with a fur trim around the hood sits up in the back seat and, with a swift blow from its axe, decapitates Michelle. The same night, on campus, a group of friends listens to Parker Riley tell an old story about one of the campus halls, Stanley Hall. According to the story, in 1973, an abnormal psychology teacher went crazy and killed all the students living in an on-campus residence hall. Paul, a school paper journalist thinks the story is bogus. Still, the story sticks in their minds, especially for Natalie, and Brenda. The next day, the front page of the campus newspaper has an article about Michelle Mancini's murder written by Paul but the papers are quickly confiscated by school officials. Later that night after going into a secluded area of woods to talk, Natalie reveals to Damon that she knew Michelle, but they hadn't spoken in years. Damon, playing on Natalie's vulnerability, tries to make a move on her but she rejects him. Upset, Damon goes into the woods to urinate but is attacked by the killer. He then is hung from a tree in a noose with the rope attached to the bumper of his car. The next day, no one believes Natalie's story due to Damon's penchant for pranks and tricks. Realizing both Damon's death and Michelle's murder closely resemble famous urban legends, Natalie goes to the library to read up on urban legends. Not realizing the terror has just begun to scare her and her friends even more.Basically, Urban Legend didn't stand out against it's competitors, it has every cliché in the book. Not to mention no memorable actors that had the same chemistry as the cast of Scream. It's over written at times and has every predictable moment: the friends don't believe in a ghost story, a couple people get killed off but everyone thinks it's a prank/fake death, a classic chase scene with a big breasted girl in a skimpy costume, the creepy janitor, the smart girl that no one believes is all of a sudden right about all the murders and of course a mega twist ending that no one will ever see coming! OK, Urban Legend isn't a horrible movie, while it has all these predictable moments and clichés, it's still actually fun to watch and a good part of the memory of good teen slasher films that came out of the 1990's.6/10",Urban Legend

Set in a New England college town that supposedly has a tradition of murder and havoc, one by one as tales are passed down from generations of students the murders of college students one by one start to return. Natalie(Alicia Witt) who's a lonely and shy new student will end up oddly enough finding herself at the center of these sadistic murders believed to be inspired by urban legends.

The direction is fair, and fast, but the script proceeds by-the-numbers, leading to a series of predictable ""surprises"" and to a preposterous climax.

All teens (actors in their 20s) are booze and sex hounds who do nothing more than party and laugh at serious stuff. How annoying.Once you find out who the killer is you realize that it would have taken precision planning on the scale of Desert Storm to pull off the murders that happen in the movie, even if some of them are purely by chance and some don't even coincide with Urban Legends which is what the whole movie is based on. Many characters are given (very) brief roles and (very) small personalities. Then they are killed. Like they are just teenage meat that are killed for our pleasure. I thought Hollywood had stopped making conveyor belt movie like this, but obviously not.When will filmmakers realize that horror films should be surreal, elaborate, scary, daring and manipulative? Never apparently. The only reason for watching this movie is Chris Young's pounding musical score. Once again he has creating a soundtrack that is simultaneously action packed and creepy.

Everyone who reads this phrase will probably think ""I've seen something like that somewhere..."" and you're right. It seems that American directors love to slaughter college students in horror movies, in particular with a few bites of sex and drunkenness to spice things up. It's not usual to be very interesting movies and this is just another movie where naughty and slightly drunk teenagers are killed like dogs on a freeway. The script is simple, taking advantage of a huge variety of US urban myths to support itself and creating around a mysterious murderer a cross web of suspicions (if you remembered ""Scream"", I also remembered watching). The actors are deeply amateur and never surprise. In fact, the cast leaves much to be desired for the level of interpretive quality, but nothing that we were not expecting from a film of this level. Alicia Witt stands out in the midst of the kids around her, but she's still a very raw and little-worked talent. In the end, you think they should all die because they are just idiots.

The reason for all this carnage were told, by the killer, was the result of a car accident some two years ago that both Natalie & Michelle, Alica Witt & Natasha Gregson Wagner, were involved in. It's in fact Michelle who was the first of many victims of the killers rampage.Using the cover of collage reporter Paul Gardner's, Jered Leto, story about urban legends the killer murders his victims in urban legend style. The movie goes way over the top in it's killings and body count that takes away any suspense it had to offer its audience since he seems to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time making him and his exploits, or murders, totally unbelievable even for a Hollywood slasher movie.. Even the end of the film when the killer is finally , to one one's surprise, reviled and killed is so predictable that it's so called surprise ending doesn't really surprise anyone. Since it comes across as a campfire story about some wild and scary buggy man not the so-called supposedly true story as it was meant to be taken as.One thing about the collage where the movie took place it was to be the safest school in the country. With all the killing slashing and murdering that took place in it Attica State prison or Gitmo would be a much safer place to farther one's collage education as well as life expectancy then it would be for those attending it.",Urban Legend

For months I heard this was a good film, now I must ask, good for whom? The producers? The investors? If I didn't know better I'd swear Roger Corman directed this one because every creepy scene was accompanied by a lightning storm. Really this show was moronic in that it was utterly implausible. The killer was simply too good at his/her work to be anywhere near believable.

The always naughty Tara Reid also stars in this one. But Gayheart delivers the best performance of them all. She's sexy even as a psycho.The death scenes were also good and creative. Expect a guy hung on a tree, a death caused by ""drowning"", etc. Some really creative and decently gory enough death scenes. So if you are into teen slashers give this one a try but be warned, it's a regular almost bad movie with an overall good entertaining factor.

Shockingly the murders they talked about start happening all over campus.

The storyline for this is fairly mediocre but still fun to watch unfold. This felt like a step down from other movies from this era like Scream, Final Destination and I Know What You Did Last Summer (I felt the same way about Blanks' Valentine film also). The acting in this is better than it should be and Leto is actually pretty good in this. The kill scenes are solid and worthwhile for horror fans.

As the anniversary of a supposed series of murders that took place on campus nears, some of the frat boys are throwing a party to have some fun... but as the mysterious killer closes in on Natalie and her friends, people begin to die one by one.I like this movie because it uses hints and clues to the killer's identity, although it doesn't really give it away. I was really surprised when I discovered who the killer was. The actors are all pretty good, and we also get horror veteran Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger from ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"") as a folklore professor, and Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky in the ""Child's Play"" films) as a strange gas station attendant. Another thing I'd like to mention was the killer's mask. Well it wasn't really a mask, it was a fur hooded parka and the hood was so large that you can't see the face of the person - it's just a black hole. I thought it was kind of original. There are many instances in this film were major flaws and clichés are present, but overall you have to take the film for what it is, and put those aside to be entertained by it.

The first half of the movie drug a little, it thankfully sped up a good bit in the second half. I liked Reese in this film, she was good and entertaining. The gore wasn't awful, like in some horror films, so that was nice to see. This movie isn't all that great, it's no horror masterpiece that's for sure, but it isn't horrible, 5/10 for Urban Legend.

Since she has an very dark secret, she kept hidden from her friends at College. But her former friend's murder is based on a urban legend, which this killer is re-creating from these eerie tales.Directed by Jamie Blanks (Valentine) made an entertaining horror film with some clever touches of suspense and black comedy. This movie was certainly made in the wake of ""Scream"". Which many film critics felt it was an bad rip-off but i felt it is one of the better horror pictures of the late 1990's. This features has better than expected cast, including:Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Tara Reid, Michael Rosenbaum, Loretta Devine, John Neville, Julian Richings and Robert Englund. Director Blanks and Screenwriter:Silvio Horta (Best known as being the developer for TV's ""Ugly Betty) are certainly having fun with their character, the suspense, dark humour and plenty of amusing in-jokes as well. Despite bad reviews by movie critics, it was an surprise box office hit. When it was released in the fall of 1998, i remember seeing it over ten years ago and i still enjoy it.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan & Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an amusing commentary track by Blanks, Horta and Rosenbaum. DVD also has Behind the Scream with commentary by the filmmakers, a deleted scene, the original theatrical trailer and a collector's booklet. If ""Urban Legend"" has an flaw, it is during the last 20 minutes of the picture. The movie goes way over the top with an disappointing conclusion. But ""Urban Legend"" is one of those movies, you could tell that the cast & crew has a great time making this. This is worth seeing. Brad Dourif appears uncredited. Followed by two loose sequels.

46,RavenGlamDVDCollector,by no stretch of the imagination could this be the killer,6,23 April 2016,"And, yeah, this is a spoiler SUPER alert, do NOT read further if you haven't seen the movie! First off, I am not a fan of the slasher movie genre. As RavenGlamDVDCollector, I do go after the pretty girls, though. My gripe with slashers is of course that blood and glamor doesn't mix. Who wants to see a pretty girl cut up? (That is, of course, a stupid question that I do not want to hear the answer to) I'm a big Rebecca Gayheart fan ever since her BEVERLY HILLS 90210 days, she was sorely missed by me when her character was killed off in that series, and so it came to pass that RavenGlam research showed the incredibly hot young cast of URBAN LEGEND. There are two sequels, direct-to-video, that seem entirely less promising, but URBAN LEGEND the original sure has a lot of pretty girls, with Tara Reid thrown in for good measure. Alicia Witt I knew from BODIES, REST & MOTION in a short but vivid sequence, aside from an absolutely vague memory of the kid in 90's sitcom CYBILL It is way beneath me to discuss the bloody scenes in this movie. They are extremely far-fetched, and as it turns out, FINAL SPOILER ALERT, committed by best friend Brenda. However berserk any human might get, and, yes, we all have it in us to kill, but come on! Rebecca Gayheart could execute that big blonde guy by hanging him? The bloody strangulation scene deemed as a 'suicide' is a symptom of a terminally-ill plot. And everybody wears that freaking abysmal style of coat. Even next to an indoor swimming pool when it was clearly shown to be a normal day, nobody else was remotely dressed for winter, and that thing was designed for Eskimos.The potholes in the plot are big enough for two army trucks to disappear into with no survivors.Best thing about the movie, Alicia Witt. Okay, I do agree, she wasn't scared enough, but in some scared scenes, she was just ooh-shame-what-a-beautiful-scared-bunny, let-me-hug-ya! Tara Reid was an absolute disappointment, I am very sorry to say, she could have done a lot better.

It could have been a nice way for the film to comment on fears inherent in all of us, as urban legends tend to focus on one simple theme. I love to go on Snopes and read Urban Legends, and even knowing they aren't true, they can still unsettle me. For stories like this the mind is the greatest director, as it can create atmosphere and tension. Unfortunately, the film goes for simple slashings of college kids. There isn't a lot of tension and one can only imagine the screenwriters telling stories to each other as quickly as they could, rather than creating the dread.

It looks slick, but some of the false scares genuinely work and the murders based on urban legends are a good addition (even though they bail on that pretty quickly). The whodunit aspect is also entertaining, there are so many red herrings thrown around in this movie. However, the climax is pretty disappointing. When you find out who the killer is in ""Scream"", you're genuinely surprised: it's a movie that's even more fun to watch the second time, because then you can puzzle it all together.

The murderer displays all the qualities of a more supernatural killer like Jason or Michael Myers, such as superhuman strength and the ability to be everywhere the plot requires him to be (like being across campus within minutes of each murder).  Signposting some of the urban legends would have been helpful (there's a urban legend about a DJ being killed on the air and people thinking it was a hoax???).  The cast is likable enough, but only Loretta Devine really stands out.  The movie could as easily have been called ""Horror Movie Cliche"" as ""Urban Legend"" (or was that subtitle spoken for by Scream?).

The fact that the killer kills based on urban legends is a pretty cool idea, and its outfit is the most menacing of those you see on 90s slashers. I've read a lot about « alternative casting », and I'm glad it went the way it did. All actors are perfect for the part, and even though Loretta Devine, whom I adore, has goofy expressions when looking scared. She did a great job giving Reese more than just the role of the rookie cop lady. Alicia Witt is a little off, or maybe it's the way her character was written, but I don't see another actress playing her part. Same with the rest of the cast. They were young, so I can overlook some of the silly delivering. Guest stars are a nice addition to any fans of the genre, and movies in general. Like I said, the writing full of illogicalities, is explained later in the movie. So it's not a big issue to me. All in all it's up there with Scream and I know What you Did last Summer.

55,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A celebration of every trope in the slasher genre,7,25 April 2017,"Urban Legend is nothing we all haven't seen before. It has elements of earlier films such as 'Candyman', 'My Bloody Valentine', 'When A Stranger Calls', 'Halloween', 'Sleepaway Camp' and 'Prom Night', just to name a few. That being said, while perhaps not very original, this late 1990's slasher picture has some funny and genuinely well-acted scenes, although I have to say personally that the protagonists were boring and forgettable, whereas the background cast of possible villains who may be perpetrating the campus crimes are the real stars of the story. Speaking of the story, it's very basic and straightforward: a university, which was once the site of a grisly massacre in the early seventies which has more or less become the school's urban myth, ends up subjected to even more killings by an unknown madman (or madwoman, nobody knows because the murderer's face is always concealed by a ratty old parka). Natalie Simon, a young student at the university, isn't sure what's real and what isn't anymore. As she tracks down the apparent killer only to find each suspect ending up dead in the end, this turns what might have been just another repeat slasher film into a very compelling and surprisingly well-built mystery.I would say that the absolute best of the cast undoubtedly are Robin Englund (A Nightmare on Elm Street) as the eccentric folklore professor William Wexler, Julian Richings (Hard Core Logo, Patch Town) as the mournful-looking albeit creepy-as-hell school caretaker, name unknown, and of course Loretta Devine (I Am Sam) as Reese, the school's strict security guard who secretly acts out film roles in her own office when nobody is looking. These three of the cast are totally unforgettable during their unfortunately small on-screen presences. Sadly most of the rest of the cast play roles which are neither memorable nor original. This may of course have been a plot device used to reflect another trope in the slasher genre (they're your run-of-the-mill preppy students, the jock, the goth, the party animal, the virgin, the queen bee and so-on), but instead of high school students, they're in university. The acting there is okay I suppose, but still not noticeable as anything worthwhile or special.As much as this film celebrates the slasher genre, more than anything else it is a testament to all those familiar old urban legends, from the infamous ""High Beams"" story, to the ""Baby Alligators in the Toilet"" one. The legends featured are mostly American but I'm sure most Canadians and Brits, as well as quite a lot of an international audience, will still completely understand these many references. The film itself is actually Canadian and not only does it feature a lot of talented Canadian actors, but it also has some of Toronto's most famously eerie film scenery, including but not limited to Unwin Avenue (the rickety bridge), which was also the location of 'Welcome to Dead House', 'The Colony' and 'Skinwalkers'.Overall, this film might not impress many veteran slasher fans, but most viewers will definitely get a kick out of it and enjoy the story all the same. Also it's a good way to introduce people to the slasher genre since it is basically an embodiment of the whole genre in its most obvious form.",Urban Legend

At Pendleton University, where a serial neck slasher supposedly struck 25 years earlier, Alicia Witt (who walks through her role in a very disinterested fashion) and her friends discover that the victims of a new killer tie into a book about popular urban legends.First off, the premise established by scripter Silvio Horta, a sort-of CANDYMAN minus the supernatural aspects, is serviceable and promising. It's just too bad that aside from this initial conceit, nothing even mildly interesting or scary happens, the characters are poorly developed cardboard cutouts (or just plain annoying) and the ending gives new meaning to the term ""desperate motive.""Even sadder, this thing peaks in the opening sequence with an uncredited Brad Dourif as a creepy gas station attendant and Natasha Gregson-Wagner getting her head whacked off. Robert Englund has a useless professor role, Danielle (HALLOWEEN 4 and 5) Harris shows up in goth (she's actually better in her tiny, restrictive role than all three of the lead females) and Loretta Devine fills in the race demographic as a Pam Grier worshipping rent-a-cop.Score: 3 out of 10",Urban Legend

And in the opening sequence, who do we have playing the role?  Brad Dourif as the gas station attendant.  Brad Dourif is a horror veteran first of all ( the voice of Chucky ) but further more he is a great actor ( Mississippi Burning, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest ) but what really makes the beginning work is not so much who is in it, but how it is directed.There is true terror in the beginning.  There are false scares and then just when you think the person is safe, WHAMMO, she gets it.  That is what the rest of the movie is missing.  There is no real suspense.  And that is what made horror films so popular in the 70's and 80's.  You can talk about classics like Psycho and Halloween but you can even go into mindless, quickie films like The Prey, Pieces, The Forest and any other 80's film that we saw as teens.  They are really not that good, but what they did is they scared you.  Horror directors emulated what they knew from guys like Polanski and Carpenter.  They had an icon to look up to and even if their films left quickly, at least they scared us as teens on video in the basement on a Saturday night.  This film is like every other recent film ( with the exception of Scream ) that has tried to be a horror film.  It just doesn't get it right.  There is no blurry image of the killer lurking ominously and imminently in the background.  There is no fancy camera work to make you think the killer is coming from one way and then all of a sudden just when you have no idea what is going to happen, someone gets a machete in the head and they roll down a flight of steps.What we have here is a bunch of good looking actors that are killed off one by one in ways that really didn't scare me.  They were actually laughable. And the other thing that really bothered me in the film is the identity of the killer.  There is no way that person could accomplish some of the feats they did.  They were not "" The Undead "" like Jason.  They were not dream characters like Freddy and they weren't as mentally unstable as Michael.The idea behind this film makes for an intriguing story, it's too bad that maybe Sean Cunningham or Steve Miner from the early 80's couldn't have done something with it.  That would be a movie I would pay to see.  But I do hope people keep trying to make the next great horror film, because it is a fun genre.  It just has to be done right.",Urban Legend
58,IonicBreezeMachine,A competently made but soulless Scream clone.,4,25 October 2020,"Set at Pendleton College, the movie follows Natalie and her group of friends as a killer stalks various people on campus staging murders inspired by urban legends.Urban Legends was one of a number of slasher films that tried to ape the formula of the then revolutionary Scream franchise by incorporating traditional slasher movie frameworks with modern 90s deconstructions and self awareness. Most of these movies never reached the level of financial or critical success of their inspiration, but a few did manage to tap into the cultural zeitgeist just enough to justify themselves from a profitability standpoint. Urban Legend is one such example. Produced on a relatively modest budget of $14 million and making back $72 million, the movie spawned two sequels (one theatrical, one DTV) but was critically eviscerated upon release, and deservedly so.The movie takes the framework established by Scream, but is now devoid of any of the substance that made Scream work. Alicia Witt is positioned as this film's Sidney Prescott equivalent, but unfortunately she lacks Neve Campbell's screen presence and feels very flat and does little to stand out from the over crowded cast. Jared Leto's Paul is clearly supposed to be a mashup of Jaime Kennedy's Randy Meeks and Courtney Cox's Gale Weathers and doesn't have the humor of the former or the appeal of the latter. Even the kills in the movie aren't particularly satisfying as they feel over produced and strain credibility to the point they lack any impact.There's some decent supporting work on display from noted character actors Brad Dourif, John Neville, Loretta Devine, and Robert Englund, but for the most part their roles are empty and have little bearing on the proceedings that follow.Urban Legends is a hollow vacuous film that tries to pretend it's smarter than it is.

59,hnt_dnl,Underrated 90s slasher flick,9,5 November 2008,"URBAN LEGEND is a slick, original, underrated slasher film from 1998. I find it an extremely effective addition to the horror genre. The monster success of SCREAM (1996) brought with it a resurgence of the teen horror slasher genre that had such success in the late 70s and 80s. URBAN LEGEND is the first one to come out after SCREAM. It is a simplistic tale told with solid doses of mystery, humor, and flair. An unseen figure in a parka is killing off students at the college campus of Pendleton, using ideas from urban legends to pull off the killings.The start of URBAN LEGEND is very scary and interesting as college student Michele Mancini (played by Natasha Gregson Wagner) is driving late at night and pulls over at a gas station run by a spooky attendant (veteran actor Brad Dourif who's done a lot of spooky roles). While Michele thinks the attendant is about to accost her and maces him to get away, he actually was trying to warn her that someone was in her backseat, our film's killer. Michele is killed.Cut to Pendleton College campus where we meet the film's 6 protagonists Paul, Natalie, Brenda, Damon, Parker, Sasha (played respectively by Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Michael Rosenbaum, and Tara Reid). They all seem to have a fun fascination with urban legends, but when they find Michele is killed, Natalie (the film's lead) takes it to another level and thinks there is more than meets the eye. But no one believes her. The campus dean doesn't want negative publicity (25 years before, there was a mass murder at one of the men's dorms).Actually more than the typical teen horror flick, it is a great forerunner to the the 21st century, with the 'urban legend' twist. It's one of those movies that has a high re-watchability factor. It's nice to pick up on clues that you might not have seen the first couple times.

I admit that it has it's weaknesses, like the fact that the acting isn't always very good (as in the opening killing), but it still manages to entertain and to thrill a great deal, because of relatively good acting, original killings and some good twists. There is even a good twist in the ending when the killer is revealed and the motive that follows is good as well. I even felt that when the full blown psycho finally got a face and became fully alive with anger and rage, the performance was very believable and good. After that the film get's a twist for the worse though, because what follows is a Halloween / I know what you did last summer sort of ending, which I totally did not like and which was absolutely unnecessary, nay STUPID!!!

At one point, two of the main characters discover a body in a trunk, and I had absolutely no idea who it was because all they gave us was a reaction shot.Regardless, despite a fun premise, the movie was trite, boring and predictable.  One can't entirely blame horror films anymore for being completely derivative since with a few exceptions, the genre has run its course.

64,Libretio,Stylish addition to the teen-horror cycle,6,25 February 2005,"URBAN LEGEND Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDSA serial killer descends on a New Hampshire college where he/she kills a number of students in the manner of various urban legends.History has a habit of repeating itself. In the early 1980's, a series of low budget 'slasher' movies emerged in the wake of HALLOWEEN (1978) and ""Friday the 13th"" (1980), most of which were condemned as substandard imitators by critics and horror fans alike. The same thing happened in 1996, following the success of Wes Craven's SCREAM, a smug reworking of genre clichés which allowed 'sophisticated' multiplex audiences to indulge an attitude of superiority over those 'crappy' old horror flicks and the 'unsophisticated' viewers who once supported them. The subsequent wave of teenage horror pics were flashy, sexy and ramped to the max, and - true to form - virtually all of them were (ho hum) trashed by critics and horror fans alike. And yet, most of them made a profit, perhaps BECAUSE they were flashier and sexier than those earlier pictures, and because they were designed for a wider demographic than 'mere' horror fans.Jamie Blanks' URBAN LEGEND is a case in point: Most reviews ran the gamut from harsh dismissal to faint praise, yet the movie is a visual treat, as creepy and atmospheric as any of the films which inspired it. Furthermore, Silvio Horta's unassuming screenplay confounds expectations with its solid narrative arc, recognizable characters and dynamic set-pieces, not to mention a climactic 'reveal' which offers a robust motive for the killer's devastating onslaught. There are a few embarrassing lapses along the way (such as the murder which takes place in full view of heroine Alicia Witt, which she ignores because she thinks it's a couple having sex!), and Horta can't resist a handful of cop-out contrivances (eg. the killer slashes the wrists of a girl known for her depressive tendencies, causing authorities to dismiss her death as suicide, though a routine forensic examination would have revealed the cuts were administered post mortem, AFTER she was strangled to death!), but these occasional blunders are redeemed by the movie's fast-paced editing, neo-Gothic visual scheme and clever plot developments. Blanks orchestrates proceedings with consummate skill, but he refuses to indulge the kind of transgressive gore that once distinguished this downmarket subgenre (where's Tom Savini when you really need him?!).As expected, the talented young cast - including Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart and Tara Reid - is pleasingly photogenic, and there are lengthy appearances by TV favorites Michael Rosenbaum (""Smallville"") and Joshua Jackson (watch out for the terrific ""Dawson's Creek"" gag!). Major co-stars include Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself!), John Neville and an uncredited Brad Dourif, who features heavily in a powerful opening sequence where Blanks and Horta pull a major switcheroo on the audience (I'll say no more). Loretta Devine is amusing as the campus security guard who views herself as a modern-day Coffy/Pam Grier (her fantasy is rudely curtailed by a climactic encounter with the rampaging maniac), and there's a brief appearance by Danielle Harris, the former child star of HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (1988) and HALLOWEEN 5 (1989), playing an adult character FAR removed from the angelic poppet of those earlier pictures!

Actually it could even be argued, that not even the fans of teen slasher genre will get a lot out of this. Then again it might be better than some of the genre films, but all in all it's so ridiculously clichéd and typical, that it's hard to think, that anyone would be take by a surprise by this film, unless it's a first teen slash film they see.",Urban Legend
70,acidburn-10,An Original Idea,8,9 March 2007,"The Plot Someone is stalking and killing off the students on Campus by basing them on Urban Legends, will anyone survive or end up being part of an Urban Legend. A journalist and his female friend try to dig deeper into the story.Despite being labelled as another Scream Rip Off, Urban Legends became one of the more successful ones and spawned 2 lackluster sequels, one being released straight to video titled ""Bloody Mary"". This is a personal favourite actually even though I know that many people hate this movie. See, this didn't just have a masked killer, it actually tried to do something creative and have the killer base his murders on urban legends which, according to me, was an absolutely brilliant and original twist which made this flick stand out among all the slasher flicks that were released at the same time. Most people have probably seen this slasher so I figured that I really didn't have to describe the story too much. This is definitely one of my fave modern day slasher flick but I guess you've all ready figured that out. I love teen slasher flicks so it was a shame that the sequel for this flick became responsible for the death of the slasher wave along with the cool and sexy chick slasher ""Valentine"". I can't see why some slasher fans don't like these high budget slasher flicks because I think that even though they are very mainstream, most of them are still very entertaining. If you still haven't seen Urban Legends, I definitely recommend you to check it out because this is one slasher flick that you should not miss!The acting I found was good, such as Jared Leto (Paul) does good, he acts well in teen films and other projects such as Fight Club and Girl Interrupted. Alica Witt (Nat)does OK as the female lead, Rebecca Gayheart was also great as Nat's best friend finally getting a chance to shine unlike her five minutes of screen time in her other slasher flick ""Scream 2"". Joshua Jackson (Damon) shows up long enough to slap a few laughs in the flick and Tara Reid (Sasha) to show her ample cleavage bobble has she runs. We also get Danielle Harris (Tosh) acting like a beeyatch, having sex with too much makeup, Robert Englund (William) acting till the next Freddy sequel and Loretta Devine (Reese) was also great in her role.All in all, underrated by critics by labelling this as another Scream rip-off, the critics never took the time to realize that this has an original idea by using Urban Legends.",Urban Legend
71,emm,Modern slasher offers little that is new.,4,6 March 1999,"I'm astonished by the massive number of IMDb users who speak plenty about slasher movies, old or new. My words will be fairly brief. URBAN LEGEND, unfortunately, is letting the fad-crazy genre put one foot in the grave again. Running like it's going to go on forever, it suffers tremendously from familiar old cliches that are overused throughout the program, and without any new horror-based elements to back it up. There are a couple of cool new twists and the acting is fairly decent, but overall, the film is another waste of production and distribution to hungry young audiences who demand surround sound. On an interesting note: the climax brings up the ""femme fatale"" factor that is cordially missing in Hollywood today. Slasher fans can't go wrong with this one, but I'm getting very sick of these movies myself.",Urban Legend

74,Min111,I seen it twice,7,26 March 2021,"I seen the movie twice, but it's great or terrific watching 'Urban Legend' for the first time since you don't know what's happening. I decided to see the movie again because I wanted to see if there was anything I missed, and it looks like I did.If you're a fan of the 'Scream' movies, you'll like 'Urban Legend'. I like these kind of 'horror' movies, and there aren't too many of these it appears. 'Urban Legend' is also a 'mystery' and 'thriller' movie just like the 'Scream' movies. I regret not seeing the movie sooner though.Anyway, I just like how a series of murders happen in and around a university with there being lots of students. I thought it was a neat idea. Quite a lot of people get killed in 'Urban Legend'. I really should've known though who the killer was, yet I still wasn't able to figure it out.I really like the main character named Natalie Simon. She's an attractive student. I didn't like her roommate though where she gets killed. I don't know why Natalie doesn't change rooms considering what her roommate does. I was surprised though the killer didn't try to murder Natalie since she was practically asleep. In fact, as she was returning to her room, Natalie doesn't bother to turn on the lights, and she goes to bed while her roommate is being attacked. I found that pretty hilarious!Another character I liked was William Wexler. I liked the part where he gives a lecture to the students. I also liked the part where Natalie breaks into Wexler's office. I was hoping she didn't get caught breaking in. I suspected William Wexler could be the killer. He does have an axe. There was the janitor too. He seemed suspicious enough. Any one of them could be the killer. You need to see the movie first. The killer does have a motive.I won't be watching the movie for the third time since I think it's a movie worth watching once or twice. Besides, you already know who the killer is. I'm pretty sure many people haven't seen 'Urban Legend'. This needs to change because the movie is decent. It's a good 'horror' movie to see on your own, or with your friends during the night.",Urban Legend

That would explain the abundance of BIG winter jackets. Looked sunny outside to me.....strange winter. It had some interesting twists, but was just not good enough.

However the film is entertaining enough for genre fans. There's a decent plot line, gory murders, and a gloomy atmosphere to boot.The cast is probably the films highest point though. Alicia Witt is good as our leading victim and Jared Leto as her love interest. Rebecca Gayheart does a nice turn as Witt's best friend. Tara Reid, Joshua Jackson, and Michael Rosenbaum make for some funny, if some what cheesy characters. Robert Englund of 'Elm Street fame appears as a college professor.While it's hardly Scream, or I Know What You Did Last Summer for that matter, Urban Legend is an amusing enough follower for slasher fans.

This could have become a pretty good slasher film, but it becomes ridiculous after about fifteen minutes or so. The idea behind the film isn't treated the way it should have been treated. And the last fifteen minutes I'm not even going to comment those. You know, I've seen episodes of ""Winnie the Pooh"" that are scarier than this. Watching ice melt is more entertaining A stupid, stupid film. The only reason why I won't give this film a 1 is because Alicia Witt and Jared Leto are quite good. The rest of the cast though I don't find words. (2/10)",Urban Legend
79,chrisbrown6453,A killer is killing off college kids using urban legends to as basis for all the killings.,5,12 July 2001,"When I first heard about this film I thought it was going to be a supernatural kind of thing were urban legends were actually coming true. The idea of that sounded very cool to me, as I was quite sick of the teen slasher Scream clones at that point. So did we get the supernatural movie I was hoping for? Of course not. Sadly this film turned out to be just another teen slasher Scream clone, and a bad one at that. I was so disappointed that it was just another teen slasher the rating dropped two points in my mind just from that fact alone. They tried to make it a little different by giving the killer an urban legend theme to the killings but unfortunately it just boils down to the ever tired ""who done it"" teen thriller. We start off with a girl watching all her friends and people around her being killed off and we soon figure out the killer is pretty much just after her (sound familiar Scream fans?). We go through the whole list of the cast trying to figure out just who the killer is and why the person is killing people (still sound familiar Scream fans?). As I said this is just a badly done Scream clone.Acting wise it's ok at best. The main girl is not bad and Robert Englund (Freddy as we all know and love him for) is pretty good too. Sadly the other main person (the school news reporter) is really quite bad and very annoying. A lot of the other acting was pretty bad too but thankfully they were all in the background for the most part. You remember the little girl from the Halloween movies that Michael chased around? Well she's the gothic roommate here and also very annoying.When the end finally happens the killer isn't too hard to figure out and the reason this person is killing people is really rather stupid. And if they were going to make a movie about urban legends why didn't they use any of the good ones? To this day I can't believe they made a part two.  What scares me more is I heard rumors of a third part, if there really is a god he won't let this happen. If you are lucky enough to have not seen this movie go rent Scream again, it's pretty much the same.",Urban Legend
80,nitzanhavoc,Clever and original story with classic 90's features. Definitely worth watching!,6,18 November 2012,"Having not always been a Horror freak, I've missed out on Urban Legend till today, 14 years after it's been done, and boy did I ever miss out!What at first appears to be a classic Slasher/Teen sub-genre, quickly evolves and develops into a cleverly written and surprising whodunit thriller. In the Horror encyclopedia, Urban Legend wouldn't appear in one of the sub-genre's chapters, but rather in an appendix.The idea is, in my opinion, very original and very well portrayed. A killer who eliminates victims one by one in accordance with the scenery and background story of the famous urban legends we all know and love (and some that I personally have only learnt of through this film). However, Urban Legend is also a stereotypical 90's Horror in many ways... the characters being college students (and actors made famous by a then successful TV drama), the location being college/dorm/student apartment, the killer being a character we've already seen, even the little wink at parody (in this case - the radio playing Dawson's Creak theme when Joshua Jackson starts his car). Also, no gore but plenty of blood in the right places. All not unlike the two famous Horror brands of the time, Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer.All in all, Urban Legends is a great film using a great idea. However, while not being able to point a finger to it, it feels like it lacks something. Perhaps a smarter twist in the end, or a more realistic ending. Perhaps the fact that the idea of using urban legends as inspiration has been the best part of the film, while the rest was not more than average. Perhaps the shortage of true Horror and fear. I'm not sure... Still, I've had a great time watching it, even it isn't the best Horror film in history, or even of its time.",Urban Legend

That'll put bums in seats!"" Equally inevitably, he was right and Urban Legend remains one of the most successful slasher films of all time. Director Jamie Blanks, who would later go for a more old school approach with another slasher film Valentine, takes a ""dot every I, cross every T"" approach here, signing on horror alumni Robert Englund, Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris for minor roles, opting for MTV casting with the bigger roles with Tara Reid, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart (before her self imposed exile from the mainstream following a DUI fatality), Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson all signing on, and borrowing from the success of Scream with a script offering frequent winks to the audience along the way.The overall effect of Urban Legend is a rather silly, only occasionally grisly, trip through late 90s pop culture with some passable performances, a workman like script and some shrewd casting.Love it or hate it, the film follows a winning formula and it's not very hard to see why it trails only the Scream movies as the highest grossing slasher film ever.

83,jayjaycee,Just another reheated dish...,5,27 April 2020,"""Urban Legend"" is a 1998 horror film directed by Jamie Blanks starring Alicia Witt and Jared Leto. I admittedly lost count of how often I expressed my love-hate relationship with the sub-genre of slasher films. While I personally declare John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" to be an absolute milestone and horror masterpiece, I just can't stand ""Friday the 13th"" and its uninspired and totally dumb screenplay, because let's face it, all of those movies imitate the same pattern that one successful film from 1978 once made popular. It's an irrefutable fact that you can't reinvent the wheel, yet people still try and fail miserably when it comes to slasher films. The delicious meal that you've been enjoying once in the seventies has been reheated more than a thousand times since then, constantly giving you this cinematic nausea you just got no cure for. Just as people thought they would die of this cinematic counterpart of a food poisoning, a clever chef called Wes Craven somehow achieved to cook a repast called ""Scream"" that brought a certain kind of freshness into the kitchen of slasher films. Sadly, it was inevitable that other people would reheat this successful fresh take and exploit it for their own profit as well, sparking a new wave of teenage slasher films in the process. The 1990s somehow managed to revive the subgenre only to produce one blatant imitation after another. While I admittedly take some sort of guilty pleasure in genre sibling ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" it's obvious that they're all cheap on the same level. This flick here doesn't draw a distinction either. It literally brims over with genre typical characteristics and apparently doesn't even try to take the bother to achieve something one might call original and goes with the same old pattern instead. It's the same old story, if you have seen one you've automatically seen them all. The biggest problem of this film is simply that it is formulaic as hell. In this case, you got a bunch of bland characters you couldn't care less about and aside from a Jared Leto in one of the leading roles, you got zero to no talent. Without a doubt the worst of them happens to be the protagonist of the story. Alicia Witt, as charming as she might be, is hilariously bad in here and thanks to her disability to convincingly portray any emotion, gave me the strong feeling I was watching a spoof rather than a serious movie. This is another heavy point of criticism. This flick here pretends to be a serious and on top of that angst-inducing horror film. What it simply isn't. The thing is, this film failed to accomplish its goal and offers none of the factors in apparently wanted to offer. Even though it had some of the correct ingredients to establish an unnerving atmosphere, the movie lacks any form of it, nevertheless. Next to the nightmarishly awful performance of the lead actress, the only aspect that actually scared me was the terrible screenplay. From cheesy characters and corny dialogue, the film doesn't give any variety and repeats every single scare. Not even the kills are memorable in any way and I totally forgot about them seconds after they occurred and from a film that focuses on creepy urban legends and has a serial killer that re-enacts the most infamous ones, it is kind of ludicrous that the film did not manage to convey the same bone chilling effect with its depicted murders. If there is one thing, I would acknowledge it might be the way the film sets the viewer on the false track multiple times. To be honest, the manner it raises a suspicion on several characters by placing a few false evidences ultimately paid off, as I haven't had a single clue about the killers true identity until the end. The fact that I was left in the dark wasn't only created by the false tracks, but also by the fact that the final revelation was simply dumb and extremely underwhelming by all means. It makes sense that the killer, who turns out to be the main characters best friend, would kill her apparent bestie, because she was involved in her fiancés' fatal car accident, but the whole procedure of taking vengeance that way is just utterly stupid. Simply the fact that the killing of several people who are not involved in the situation poses more than an immense endangerment to her undertaking makes me hit my forehead. Instead of killing her directly she rather plays dumb games with her other friends (and some strangers?). Why would she do that? Why would she do so many unnecessary actions that not only increase the probability of failing, but also give her actual target the opportunity to prepare for the worst? This conclusion is nothing but boring and extremely poorly conceived. You know, this film could have been tremendously better if it had explored the overall lore of those myths and the frightening nature of this fascinating phenomenon. It could have been a sophisticated psychological horror film, a cult classic of its own, but what did they do instead? The reheated the same foul dish by drawing on the same old formula. I mean, in some instances they even referenced some famous urban legends in a subtle way that only the ones who know about the subject matter would understand, but keeping this actually great advantage on a shallow level was the wrong decision. If there is anything I fully enjoyed about this flick it has got to be how the film includes short roles for Robert Englund and Brad Dourif, both iconic horror movie villains and urban legends in their own way. But that's it. All in all, this film is once again just another repetition of what you have already seen ages ago, another copycat of another copycat, a borderline imitation of the holy classics. In comparison to other entries to the nineties slashers it sadly is way less entertaining, cheap in both writing and acting and not frightening in the slightest. An averagely stupid, mindless and boring and cheesy campus slasher one can probably only enjoy in the company of friends. More than slumber party flicks movies of this genre from this decade sadly will never be. This one doesn't really pose any difference to the others. The fact that those films are more than this clearly is an urban legend.",Urban Legend
84,Quicksand,Remember the Drive-In?,7,12 May 2002,"Horror movies these days (and by ""these days"" I mean, since 1982) have no idea what they're supposed to be or how to do it; let alone how to make money at the same time.  THIS one is always going to hold a special place in my heart, and I'll tell you why.Three days before its release in 1998, it was broadcast, digitally, via satellite, to roughly 2 dozen colleges across the US.  It was not an isolated incident; previews have been brought to certain colleges in such a manner for nearly 10 years now.  My point, however, is that a free movie brings the kids out of the woodwork, and it was seeing this film with 500 screaming college kids that made it so great, in my mind.People yelled, they threw things, they made loud fun of the dumb white people that seem to populate every horror film ever made.  ""Don't go in there!""  ""Look in the backseat!""  ""Don't run UP the stairs, you pinhead!""Whatever.  People were screaming and throwing things at the screen, which is what they should be doing.  I recommended it to a friend, and watched it again three days later, at an early showing with 20 people in the theater. Suddenly the movie was bad, it was SO bad.  I didn't get it.Behold, the power of a community, visceral experience.  The movie was good for that; not for sitting at home alone to watch it, or watching it alone in a big theater (which is exactly how most paid film critics watch ALL movies).

She thinks she has escaped a Psycho (Brad Dourif) at a gas station only to find the real killer in the back seat with an ax. The film centers on a small group of friends and Natalie (Witt) seems to be at the center of it as her room mate (Danielle Harris) is killed while she is going to sleep. Half the time this slasher film delivers quite nicely. Director Jamie Blanks and Cinematographer James Chressanthis make the film look great with interesting framing and effective moody atmosphere. Like the opening sequence, and the pursuit and death of Sasha (Tara Reid), the film delivers with solid suspense and good kills. Unfortunately, the film is also unbalanced. The deaths of professor Wexler (Robert Englund) and Parker (Michael Rosenbaum) are weak and unconvincing. The movie bounces back and forth between some really good set pieces and some clumsy ones. Blanks is going for a classy horror film here but he seems to be unsure if he is pulling it off. There are many times when the audience must throw logic completely out the window or the plot doesn't work at all. The scary looking killer wears a big coat with a hood, yet we see no less than 4 other characters with the exact same coat in their possession. This cheapens the movie and so does the lapses in logic of the script. The overall effectiveness of the film still works with above average suspense and some great kills. These nice moments are mixed in with cheap effects like a friend coming up behind another character and creating a false scare. This is ""Urban Legend"" in a nutshell.

I'm not one of those people, and I will explain why Urban Legend despite its energy and cool pitch didn't live up to my expectations.The film begins strongly with a scene full of suspense, that I have difficulty believing was shot by Jamie Blanks, introduces the premise of an ""urban legend"" killer.But after that, nothing matches the thrills of the first scene except maybe the appearance of Robert Englund. The film proceeds to follow all the tropes of the genre so strictly that it removes all intrigue in its ""whodunit"" plot.And once again, the conclusion is inevitable.

They involved a group of pretty young actors in movies completely devoid of likeable characters, tension or any kind of intelligence.Urban Legend is an example of this wave. Stars from recent TV shows were cast to draw in the young audience members who wouldn't know good from bad in terms of filmmaking. Even Robert Englund can't save this turkey.Aside from being a time capsule from the late 90's this really doesn't serve any purpose. When I went to see the vile Scream in the 90's I saw David Cronenberg's Crash straight after it. So my advice to you is to watch this auto-erotic car fetishist's wet-dream instead.

I didn't like this film at all,the acting was cheesy,the deaths took life an hour to happen and it was just a stale or dull plot. I recommend not to see this if you want to see a horrible version of scream. The only good thing about this was Danielle Harris(Halloween 4-5',stake land)that was good but of course the best thing in the film had to be killed just because knowing my luck. This is a bad movie just like I know what you did last summer. I'm not watching the sequels,urban legend 2 or the third TV movie titled 'Bloody Mary'.

97,NJMoon,Sub-URBAN LEGEND In It's Own Mind,5,4 September 1999,"URBAN LEGEND is neither.  It takes place in a bucolic suburban college campus and will never be a legendary horror film.  If you think URBAN LEGEND is not your usual teen scream flick - you're wrong!  Despite it's attempts to rise above the genre, it never manages to creep far above it's own mediocrity.  The first twenty minutes feature so many ""sudden shocks"" (complete with abrupt orchestra stings)that the viewer becomes numbed to surprises before the first bloody corpse hits the pavement.Bland performances all around by a cast that may be just cutting their teeth and obvious red-herrings in the form of creepy appearances by Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) and Brad Dourff (CUCKOO'S NEST)only add insult to fatal injury.  Once the corpses out-number the characters you'll easily guess the campus cut-throat.  The Hollywood fade-out is yawningly predictable.

The kills are great and still hold up to this day.The cast and characters are all great and all have there moments to shine in the movie even Michael Rosenbaum who as always been one of my favourite actors.
And you're always second guessing who the killer is which adds a good mystery to the film.The reveal of the killer is amazing and I never saw it coming and the twist about why she wants revenge was Great twist that dosent ruin the story but expands it.
The actress on who plays the killer is amazing aswell through the movie but her acting really shines when she is revealed.The killer also looks simple and effective its basically just a jacket and hood and you can't see there face I like it alot it's simple and effective and still manages to be chilling.Verdict 8.5/10 a fun 90s slasher with great kills and story and killer reveal twist that I didn't see coming one the better post scream slashers.",Urban Legend

Let's see if there is a good thing on it... Oh, yeah! The opening scene! I think that's why I gave it a 2 out of 10. But a single scene doesn't make a film good, specially if the screenplay looks to be written by a 10 year-old child.The acting is just depressing. Alicia Witt looks like a statue. Rebecca Gayheart looks to be in a mental institute. And when Tara Reid is on the screen we start to beg for the serial-killer the murder her.Comparing ""Urban Legend"" to ""Scream"" is not very different from comparing ""Showgirls"" and ""Shakespeare in Love"".

103,Phroggy,What's new on the slasher front ?,2,25 March 1999,"Okay, since you've been so far, you're interested in the genre, so let's have a look at the new, improved recipe for slasher movies compared to Halloween/Friday rips-off. All this is like teenagers post-Halloween stuff, but now the average students are supposed to be modern and sometimes (sometimes.) really fleshed-out. And. it's obviously the end of the girls as just ""Screamers"" and psycho-fodder : just as in real life, they fight back (Jamie Lee Curtis did away with those clichés in H20). THOUGH. not on UL, or just once : the radio attendant just sits waiting for the axe to go down. The killer has his gimmicks : not horror movies this time, but urban you-know-what. But. he keeps on taunting the characters with the references they both have, as well as, presumably, the audience. This wasn't featured in the old slashers, which weren't thinking that far. They still relies on non-stars, or better : some guy straight out of TV and anxious for his/her BIG BREAK. Aaaand. asking for less money ! Some says those movies are inexpensive, and they are compared to Gibson/Schwarzenneger stuff, but they have better production values than the old slashers. Look at ""The curve"", with somewhat similar post-SCREAM premises : it's not a good movie, but it cost just one million bucks. 1/15th this one. Have I got your attention ? On this one and IKWYDLS 2, clichés are back : the killer bumps off an entire cast before getting to the one he really wants, he seems to be ubiquous  and still appears and disappears mysteriously. Aaand. let's wait for that old favorite, when the heroine has bodies falling on her head ! (THIS was also in IKWYDLS 1/2) There are one or two good shots on that one, especially the one where one victim's face is reflected in the void behind the killers'hood, seen behind a window. Okay, nothing new camera-wise, but some decent cinematography. But next time, maybe they could just maybe figure out that everybody in the audience condones stupidity in his/her fun, right ?

104,nashw82,Terribly Contrived Post Scream Horror but still Entertaining,6,12 November 2020,"For those of us who were horror fans in the 90's we know it was some rough years until Scream came along, then some more rough years as a whole slew of Scream clones popped up hoping to have similar success.
A bevy of hot young stars, a few good kill scenes, and an interesting premise make this worth a watch. The use of urban legends was a good idea, and it lead to some fun moments and creative deaths. With the occasional scare and one or two creepy scenes, though nothing really terrifying for horror fans, it is good definitely a good watch for teenagers or fans or 90s slashers. But it is still full of plot holes and some of the situations are overly contrived so don't expect too much. Plus they managed to get Robert Englund, Mr. Kreuger himself in there too.

105,shaun98,"""Scream"" clone doesn't deliver (possible spoiler)",4,13 April 2002,"""Urban Legend"" is little more than a byproduct of the ""Scream"" era, a copycat movie destined to fade into obscurity in a few years. The basic premise is actually fairly interesting: a serial killer disposes of victims based upon urban myths and legends. However, the script itself is ponderous, obvious, and stupid. While slickly photographed, here are few thrills to be found, and it just gets dumber until it falls apart at the end.The acting is actually pretty decent given the circumstances. Alicia Witt is gorgeous and does a good job with what she has to work with. Jared Leto, the best member of the cast, has since moved on to bigger and better things. Robert Englund is good as a Wes Craven lookalike, and Loretta Devine injects the film with a much needed spark as a Pam Grier wannabe. Many have put down Rebecca Gayheart for the turn her role takes, but don't blame her, blame screenwriter Silvio Horta. Finally, Brad Dourif has an amusing cameo as a stuttering gas station attendant.However, despite their best efforts, the film never rises above its material. It's just another tired exercise. I had actually harbored a vain hope of liking it, but alas, it was not meant to be.*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Pheonix Pictures through TriStar Pictures",Urban Legend
106,Panterken,Above average slasher-film with interesting premise and great opening-scene.,6,17 July 2007,"Urban Legends is one of my favorites of the wave of 2nd generation slasher-movies created after the release of Scream. The story isn't bulking with originality but the premise is pretty strong and interesting. After a brilliant opening scene ( the best in the whole wave of films) the film soon falls into a formulaic horror pattern, leaving the viewers disappointed and bored at times. Don't get me wrong, there are some thrilling slashing-scenes and fans of Scream ( like myself) will certainly get a kick out of it. There are a lot of plot holes but who cares about that as long as you get a scare out of it. The purpose of these films is nothing more than that so in that object it succeeds.The acting is above average for a horror film, despite the horrible Tara Reid, who has yet to produce one decent acting achievement. Joshua Jackson , Jared Leto and Alicia Witt ( who we can also admire alongside Mr. Pacino in the recent ""88 Minutes"") steal the show. Joshua Jackson is a perfect fit for his role and we can almost see the joy jump from the scream in his scenes. He has a really fun part to play and does so with a lot of liveliness. Keep your eyes open for the hilarious subtle Dawson's Creek gag.To conclude: If you're looking for a thrill-ride and don't mind some plot holes, if you were a fan of Scream and I know what you did...it's a must-see. Probably the third best of the 2n slashers generation.If you're looking for something more than some thrills, avoid it. I'd recommend you rent the fantastic Zodiac. If you're a horror fan with high standards I suggest '1408'.C.",Urban Legend
107,vasco_cid,"Deja vú, yes but hell entertaining",6,25 July 2002,"It's own title identifies the kind of movie it is. Urban Legends is just another teen slasher horror movie, that we all feel we've seen before, most noticeably in the Scream trilogy. But this time Urban Legends is one step ahead of the other horror movies, whereas the plot is no way original. It can be resumed in a single sentence. On a US High School, a killer starts slashing teenage students, based on the good old Urban Legends. Needles is to say what comes next: big boob girls running away from the killer, the central character, who, by the way happens to be a girl, never gets killed, despite being stalked every now and then, and lots of gore scenes, lots of blood and jump scenes. This is the main essence of an horror movie, it could also be called Scream 4, the only thing you had to do is put Neve Campbell on the lead and a goofy best friend cop, and that was it. Oddly enough, after all these `qualities' that could also be called plagiarism, Urban Legends ends up being a surprisingly good horror movie, with a great Tv Show cast, and a plot full of hilarious lines. Also what is more than expected is that when the movie starts, everyone knows what's going to happen: everyone gets killed except for the lead, a big twist in the end to reveal the killer or the killers, and also another twist in the very end that conveniently has to leave room for a sequel. That's probably where Urban Legends gets stronger: the killer is the very last character you may expect (although clues where falling down like rain), the twist in the very end is not only surprising and interesting, not mention humanly impossible or improbable. Jamie Blanks decently directed providing chills wherever and whenever they are needed, gets the movie to be worth more for its horror and for its lines rather for it's deja vú feeling. 6 out of 10",Urban Legend

It's very rare to have totally-origin movies.The new ground broken here is the Urban Legends. What a great premise! Why nobody ever thought about it before?The plot is not great, but the death scenes are shocking, inventive and funfunfun! Some points (especially the ending) are over the top, but it's still fun.A great popcorn horror movie.",Urban Legend
109,Zombified_660,A lean and stripped down version of Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer.,7,2 April 2006,"Urban Legend was pretty much globally ignored when it came out. It's release was timed badly and resulted in it coming out at the same time two other teen-horror movie franchises were kicking off, Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer (You may have heard of them lol). Still, several years on and with the teen-slasher fad all but dead (check out Cry_Wolf if for some perverse reason you want to watch it's death throes :P) Urban Legends stands up better to a repeat viewing than it's peers.Part of the reason for this is it's pacing. Although Urban Legend is smart and sassy enough to punch at the same weight as Scream, I'll cover that later. Urban Legend is paced in a similar fashion to the early slashers from the 80s, with a high bodycount, large cast (who are noticeably less numerous by the end :).) and very little time spent on overbearing witticisms. It's fast, it's punchy and it's one of those films that you enjoy enough that you don't really feel the time passing.It helps that it's also funny and self-deprecating without it getting in the way of the movie. Instead of setting up a 'and here's the funny...' scene like Scream does, Urban Legend builds it into the plot, saving valuable time for horror. In fact, a lot of the humour in the film is built into the horror sequences, again drawing on the movies of the 80s, especially the latter half of the Friday the 13th series.All well and good, it sounds fantastic, so why the 7 and not a 9 or 10? Well, despite all its advantages it is still a 90s style teen horror, and with that come all the genre stereotypes, dumb dialogue peppered with 'dude' and all the popular actors from sitcoms/teen dramas that you can muster. It isn't as achingly and offputtingly hip as the Scream series or I Know What You Did Last Summer (C'mon, Sarah Michelle Gellar and the Love-Hewitt at the same time? That's just plain wrong lol) but it is still a little overbearingly 'down wid da kids'.Anyhow, the fact is I still like Urban Legend and can see myself enjoying it for quite some time, whereas the need to rewatch Scream hasn't exactly gnawed away at me to be honest. It's the kind of movie that despite obvious shortcomings is enough pure simple fun that you'll keep it in mind over other films, and that's something I can say of very few movies.

It came out after ""Scream"" when all of these sorts or movies were being shoveled off the conveyor belt as fast as they could be made with little to no thought. Initially I rated this as a five, but after a bit more thought I had to scale it back. I know this film is not supposed to be any sort of masterpiece and you need to watch it for what it is, but it is wrong for movies to be treated as lackadaisically as this. I mean, high school students can write movie scripts as simple as this. The addition of the killings following urban legends did add a little uniqueness to this film, but just a small amount. Although, instead of that quick fix, perhaps they should have made a better movie with better dialogue and done something outside of a cookie-cutter formula.

There is no punch, no shock and no suspense, just your typical and redundant scares with a heavy music cue. Needless to say, the premise is a tremendous waste of a great idea.It appears that the movie tried to parody itself near the end, when one of the characters asks ""Where's the twist?"", but Craven's successful ""Scream"" did it far better with much more wit.Save your time and money by avoiding this ho-hum, saw it all before, half-baked flick.",Urban Legend

Ten years later everybody's ripping off Saw and now the teenage crowd is flocking to see ""torture porn"" at the cineplex. Movies like Scream made the late nineties kids feel trendy while these newer films make them feel both trendy AND hardcore.Films like Urban Legend are now (mostly) a thing of the past, so I decided that maybe now is the time to go back and see what I missed the first time around and my conclusion is that the thirty-year old Bill owes the teenage Bill an apology. This movie is a complete waste of time and a total piece of crap!Slow and stupid is a phrase that perfectly describes both this film and all the characters in it. How these morons ever made it to an ivy league school (much less high school) eludes me and they're unlikable as hell too! However, I forgot how cute Tara Reid was before she got fake boobs and started drinking all the time.As for the killer's methods, what is the point of imitating famous urban legends? Sounds very tedious to me and not exactly foolproof like it's portrayed. Someone going through all these ridiculous lengths to kill people would most likely get caught or killed very quickly. I'm all for the suspension of disbelief but this went way beyond the tricks that one skinny girl would be able to pull off.The final scene where the killer is unmasked and revealed to be none other than Rebecca Gayheart is a travesty.

Post-murder scenes always seem like a sleazy excuse for all characters to keep going on to the next scene. I find it's okay if they just play this once or twice, but in fact that they use this formula without any fresh idea to give, the whole urban legend goes real concept of this movie becomes too stale to be followed.The movie certainly has more to offer, for example they have quite creative murders, few great lines in the climax towards the end and the twist also (predictable but) fun. However, it needs me to get through the boredom too much to bother with good things happened here. This movie maybe gets better after I see the sequels/spin-offs.",Urban Legend
130,Xophianic,"Yet another teen slasher movie, but this one better than some",6,4 February 2000,"This is yet another teen slasher movie, one of the many to have come out recently. I don't think this one quite ranks up to the SCREAM movies, but I think it was better than the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER movies.College student Natalie Simon, (Alicia Witt) mourning over the recent murder of an old friend, finds herself in great danger after a large number of students are being murdered. Each murder is performed in the style of an urban legend, which many of the kids know. Everyone is a suspect, including the best friend Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), love interest Paul (Jared Leto) and friend/prankster Damon Brooks. (Joshua Jackson)The premise of this movie is fairly cool, but the rest of the movie is basic slasher-movie type stuff. It's pretty predictable too, as are most movies like this one. The acting is not especially great, but some of it is fair. Alicia Witt does a good job as the star of this movie. Rebecca Gayheart probably does the best acting job of all, especially at the end.Most all of the characters are boring and flat, aside from the main one. Many are simply there to get killed, and some that are more important are not as interesting. Still, this movie is better than I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and probably worth a rent.",Urban Legend
131,MadReviewer,Scraping the Bottom of the Slasher Film Barrel,3,17 May 2001,"Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the horror genre spewed forth the original slasher film:  ""Halloween"".  While ""Halloween"" will never be an all-time great film -- its appeal is distinctly limited, after all -- it did become the standard for slasher films, combining gratuitous gore with a high level of suspense and terror.  The fact that ""Halloween"" still remains a scary film today for new viewers is a testament to its enduring strength. Then came ""Friday the 13th"", and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- both good, scary films, although not in the same realm as ""Halloween"" -- and then came a horde of other forgettable sequels and series, each one worse than its predecessor, until the slasher genre had degenerated into a unmitigated pile of utter crap.Then, nearly twenty years later, ""Scream"" arrived in the theaters, and the slasher genre was reborn, arising out of the ashes like a reborn phoenix. A new cycle had started.Then came ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", which pushed this new cycle onto the downward spiral towards the toilet.And now, we've arrived at ""Urban Legend"".  The toilet.Still want to know what this awful film is about?  Fine.  A psychotic killer is re-enacting a slew of ""urban legends"", myths about killers and murders that seem to be whispered lore in high schools and colleges all across America.  The killer in question is stalking the young, attractive co-eds of a college campus.  In a half-hearted nod to ""Scream"", the co-eds are smart enough to recognize the urban legends and realize that they comprise the killer's modus operandi . . . but not smart enough to use that knowledge to keep themselves from getting killed.  Lots of blood, gore, and co-ed sex ensues before the killer's identity is finally  revealed.As a fan of the horror genre, and as a fan of slasher films, I don't have particularly high expectations for a slasher film.  I expect to see one or two imaginatively engineered death scenes, I expect to jump out of my chair in surprise/shock at least once, I expect one or two characters to have some funny, sarcastic lines spread out through the film for comic relief, and I expect maybe one gratuitous, well-shot sex scene between the Handsome Jock and the Pretty Troubled Girl.  That's it.  Yes, that's formulaic beyond nearly all belief, but that's also the formula for a decent slasher film.Well, ""Urban Legend"" lives up to none of these expectations.  The direction is dull and plodding, the scenes produce no sense of fear or tension, and the gore is uninspired.  All the big `surprises' can be seen coming from a mile away.  Considering there's actually a promising set-up with the use of ""urban legends"" as the catalyst for the death scenes, this is incredibly disappointing.  (Ooh, the killer's got . . . a butcher's knife.  Gee, that's original.) There's also the obligatory scenes of one character tapping another on the shoulder at what's supposed to be a tense moment, the character trapped in the darkness with nothing but a flashlight, the killer sprinting past the unwitting characters in the background as they helplessly moan about their plight . . . unfortunately, these scenes are so ineptly scripted, and shot with such lifeless direction, they don't serve any purpose except to make you check your watch more than the movie (or TV) screen.  It's typical, ordinary, obligatory scenes like these that can be tweaked into something special into the better-than-average slasher film -- but in ""Urban Legend"", these scenes are only typical and ordinary at best. At worst, they stink.  And they usually stink in ""Urban Legend"".The cast is undeniably good-looking, but apart from that, they also don't do very much of interest, apart from either brooding, whining,  pouting, asking incredibly stupid questions, having sex, or getting butchered like sheep. Sidebar:  the three main female leads; namely Natalie (Alicia Witt), Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), and Michelle (Natasha Gregson Wagner), are completely interchangeable in this film.  You will easily confuse their names throughout the film -- indeed, you will easily confuse THEM throughout the film, because they are all the same character.  The producers of this film could've saved some cash by only hiring one of these actresses, and by having that one actress perform some extended monologues.  Absolutely nothing about ""Urban Legend"" is scary, interesting, or for that matter, worth watching.Not even a brief appearance by Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund is able to resuscitate this rotten, insipid waste of film.  Avoid ""Urban Legend"" (and its sequels . . . shudder) at all costs.  Grade:  D-",Urban Legend
132,mrspasm,Rural Myth,7,2 July 2009,"Urban Legend is yet another teen horror which comes off the success of Shriek and Buffy. Indeed it is almost like a hilarious screamer, but with less funny bits. It has the familiar story of a bunch of pretty (ugly) teens (30 somethings) being hunted down by a cloaked killer with some sort of vendetta. The main character is our lovely innocent heroine, but who is trying to kill her? Her boyfriend? Her crazy room mate? Her boyfriend's freakshow friend? The spooky teacher who just happens to be Freddy Kruegger? The petrol pump guy? Her best friend? The bin man? The Fonz? A ghost? Bin Laden? The slut? The jock? The nerd? The Greaser? The head master? The campus cop? Someone else? Some Thing else? Who knows? The killer seems to kill his victims in a way that recalls spooky stories we tell as infants, known in America as Urban Legends for some reason. For example. A babysitter is phoned by a spooky man who says 'I'm going to eat your babies!' She hangs up and phones the police to say a weirdo has been phoning her. The police phone back to say that the caller is phoning from inside her own house! She tries to escape but is eaten by a bear. Ironically, the babies have also been eaten. Such is the way the killer kills in this film, except he/she/it uses and axe and a microwave. I wish they had used my favourite Urban Legend- A couple are driving at night and listening to the radio. An emergency news broadcast is broadcast about a local maniac escaping from a local asylum, and is believed to be local. The couple are also local. The man needs a dump so he decides to go into a nearby house. The girl is scared but has a gun, so waits in the car, in the dark, in the rain. She turns on the radio only to hear What A Wonderful World. The sheer awfulness of the song makes her implode. Meanwhile the husband has entered a nearby house. He thinks it is a bit strange that the residents keep cocking their eyes to and fro and cooing at him, but is busting so much he goes for his dump anyway. Afterwards he opens the toilet door and finds he is stuck up a tree. Terrified he almost falls, but hangs from the branch. He realises that the pressure on his bowels made him hallucinate and that the house was really a nest, and it's occupants were pigeons. Just as he wonders if pigeons live in nests, a lighthouse which had recently collapsed on a nearby mountain rolls over the top of them, crushing them all. The car has been watching all this closely and decides to drive home by itself. On the way it sees a hitchhiker. He picks him up. Of course the hitchhiker is the local maniac. The maniac sees the girl's wrecked corpse and cries as he was the one who should have murdered her. Suddenly, the man and the woman leap up from the back seat and eat the maniac's brains, shouting 'We only pretended!' five times. On the fifth time they all vanish and several years later are found inside a mirror.That is my favourite story. Why it wasn't used I'll never know.Best Scene: When the killer chases the girl into a room of barbed wire, cuts off her leg with a pair of hedge clippers, puts a firework into the stump, lights it, and she flies up into the air exploding, and the sparks spell out the message 'I'm coming for you next, Sydney!'",Urban Legend
133,mfnmbvp,'Urban Legend' (1998),6,15 November 2012,"'Urban Legend' starts off strong. And I mean, like, really strong for a horror movie of the late 90's ilk. The kind where the characters are all self-aware intellectuals but have no problem being dumb as hell anyway. Yeah, the opening sequence is *that* kind of good. But then it all goes pretty much as downhill as it can get from there on....It's sad to say that Brad Dourif may be the highlight of this feature, given that he is only included in one scene, but whatever. The rest of our cast is the typical montage of up-and-coming late teens/early twenties stars. Jared Leto would of course go on to make great things with 'Requiem For A Dream' two years later, Joshua Jackson has been in a handful of good movies and is recognizable, which is probably a good thing since he is probably the most recognizable face in the whole movie to me. However, Loretta Devine really steals the show here. Forget Rebecca Gayheart and the trying year she had with making not only 'Urban Legend' but appearing in 'Scream 2' also. The ending few minutes are predictable to say the least. But like I said, Loretta Devine makes the whole crap scenario tolerable. The entire movie pays more than enough homage to 'Scream' and gives us an extremely generous helping of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' worship. But, sadly for 'Urban Legend', we've all seen both of those two movies, and Kevin Williamson did it a lot better. The end sequence features one scene that throws 'Halloween' homages in your face, but it just doesn't work like how it did for John Carpenter.See 'Urban Legend' because it has a lot to say. However, it feels more essential than it actually is.URBAN LEGEND -----6/10.",Urban Legend
134,DJ_Shilo,It's only a legend and a stupid movie,2,21 September 2018,"I wish they would do something with these movies instead of making them T&N or bloody messes. A good concept can't go far and falls flat with ""Urban Legend"". Directed by Jamie Blanks, whoever the hell he is, he misses every marker with this film and settles for the gory violence instead.It's about a college student, Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) who is murdered in her car and found by the police. While the college students are shocked to learn of her death, Natalia Simon (Alica Witt) discovers that someone is murdering the students based on urban legends and it looks like she is on the list.""Scream"" was clever with the slasher genre and it gave us something new. We knew it was someone in a mask, we discovered why and it was a big revelation. We left the theater feeling like the movie came to a close and we weren't ripped off. This picture follows the same formula but it doesn't feel convincing because the revelation of why the killer is murdering everyone is stupid and pointless. It gives us an unsatisfying reason to slaughter people for the last hour and give use useless violence. There, I just gave the ending away.I don't believe I can say that the picture has any real build up other than a stab here and a chopped head off there. Every scene is someone being slaughtered like a typical slasher with no imagination at all. It's sad because it does have a good backdrop with the urban legends setting but it hardly uses it and instead people's heads are shoved into something or they are axed in the back or neck. There is one sequence where a character is hanging from a rope and he is strangled. I'm not convinced. The picture looks too cheap to convince me that any of it is good. Even the music is downright stupid and depressing.You have to wonder how a killer in a parka coat is able to walk around in a state of emergency on the campus. The security officer of the school is too stupid to act and yet a killer stalks the college wearing a fur parka that covers just enough of the face so we can't see it. These kinds of movies are put out now for cheap thrills and somehow they still manage to attract an audience. I saw this picture in a full house and it surprised me that it was that full but what surprised me more was when the picture started, it looks like the audience was glued to the screen.This picture will probably do well with its target audience being teenagers because this is what they want to see but in the end, all we get is a junk thriller that seems to be on the right path in the beginning but falls right off the wheels ten mins into the first act.",Urban Legend
135,tripwires,Average at best. (spoilers ahead),2,20 October 2001,"You know those movies that people watch on cable TV on a boring Saturday afternoon because they haven't got anything better to do? Those movies that they wouldn't watch in the theatre because they know it would be a waste of money? ""Urban Legend"" is one of those.So today I saw it on HBO, right, because it has the gorgeous Jared Leto, right, and for 2 hours, right, I was kinda, like, wondering where the casting director got his/her actors (with the exception of the fine Jared Leto and a few other people whose name I'm not bothered to know), particularly the annoying one who played...what's her name? Natalie's best friend? Yes, that girl. Ooh yes! Her name's Brenda! So anyway, ""Urban Legend"" is definitely better than its sequel...but it doesn't say much, because ""Final Cut"" is one hell of a bad movie. But that's not the point. I think what I'm getting at here is...how many times does ""Scream"" need to be remade until Hollywood is satisfied? ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is silly enough; do we need crap like ""Urban Legend"" and its stupid little sequel? I don't think so.""Urban Legend"" not only has an incredibly hilarious plot, it has some hilarious acting to boot. But let's talk about its plot first. So some psycho college kid decides to go on a killing rampage (sp?) based on urban legends. That's great, really, but the next time someone does that again, please give him/her a believable motive, because the one provided by this movie made me laugh. I wouldn't spoil it for anyone, so I'll just leave it at that.The acting. Okay, Jared Leto, like I said before, is fine, as always. Ever since ""My So-Called Life"" I've been wanting to see more of this gorgeous and talented young man, and I think he was the best thing out of this mess that's called ""Urban Legend"". My only real gripe (sp) I have with its cast is that girl who played Brenda. She annoys me. From her very first scene until her last, I kept waiting for her to die so that I don't have to look at her annoying face and hear her annoying voice and watch her annoyingly over-act. (spoilers) Who would've thought SHE was the killer? That came as a surprise to me, I'll grant you that, but why her? Why couldn't she be one of the victims? Why couldn't she take, oh, Joshua Jackson's place? Why did the film-makers have to put me through the agony of watching her??Another one is Tara Reid. She was okay, until her death scene. Her version of fear is really laughable; I've never seen fear being so badly acted out. The way she tried to convince the audience she's really scared is so pathetic, I found myself wishing the killer would get it over with and just chuck that axe into her.""Urban Legend"" is really not that scary. Or rather, it's not scary, period. Unless you're really bored and like Jared Leto or Josh Jackson, don't see this.

Loretta Divine is charming as the security guard whom says a silent prayer to Pam Grier before she confronts danger. And Robert Englund is always a welcome addition to any horror movie's cast. The performance of our heroine, Alicia Witt, is a little stale, but the action more than makes up for that. The ending is of the type that makes you sit upright and say ""OHHHHH SO THAT'S WHY!!!"" Then, there's a twist. And it gets resolved. And then ANOTHER twist, then that gets resolved. And just when you are preparing yourself for the ending credits, THERE'S ONE LAST TWIST, only this one does NOT get resolved.A sequel is reportedly in the works, but this movie would stand on it's own whether or not it becomes the latest sequel sprouting franchise.

I watched it when it first came out and enjoyed it. I watched it again, this time on bluray, a few days ago. It's still a much better than average campus horror flick.

I've been revisiting a few of them this October to get into the proper Halloween spirit, and I must admit that they don't hold up all that well, though I'm not entirely surprised by that.Urban Legend has as its center gimmick the conceit that a killer stalking a college campus is utilizing urban legends (hence the title) to dispatch of clueless coeds. This leads to a few fun set pieces that function as sort of a Rogues' Gallery of so many of the myths you remember reading about on Snopes. Unfortunately, the urban legend that most frightened me as a child--the one about the girl cowering in her dorm room as someone scratches aggressively at her door, only to discover in the morning that it was her mortally wounded roommate attempting to secure help after being attacked by an escaped maniac--is nowhere to be found.The writing is pretty clunky. All the characters are archetypes (the Frat Boy, the Prankster, the Supportive but Nondescript Best Friend, and, of course, the Virginal Heroine) and they constantly spew Kevin-Williamson-esque ""hip"" dialogue replete with pop culture references and colorful epithets. Everybody spends a good deal of time gaslighting the Virginal Heroine for absolutely no reason and very little makes sense. The direction, by the same token, is competent but never steers away from the ridiculousness of the premise (the killer's schemes to reenact the urban legends are awfully contingent on coincidence and luck). There's no shortage of unintentionally hilarious moments.At the same time, it's never boring, nor does it ever become too insulting to your intelligence (which is to say, it is insulting to your intelligence, but just insulting enough, I suppose). And the cast is good, doing what they can with the flat material they're given. Look for fun cameos by horror veterans Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund, Brad ""Chucky"" Dourif, and Danielle Harris of Halloween 4 fame as the raging Goth queen, whom we know we are meant to condemn in our hearts because she is so crazy she has to take--gasp!--Lithium.",Urban Legend

""Urban Legend"" is a teen-age moviegoer's dream. It has familiar young television stars, familiar older stars with cult followings (Robert Englund as the aforementioned professor, John Neville as the dean), an edgy sense of humor, a tricky plot and characters too genre-savvy for their own good. Maybe there will be an over saturation of ""Scream""-inspired horror films someday soon, but this one feels fresh. Someone at Pendleton University, the fictional safest college in the United States, is committing murders in the style of contemporary urban folk tales. There's an ax murderer lurking in the back seat of a car, a boy hanged in the secluded spot where he and a girl were parked, a killer on the telephone calling from within the victim's house, even a pet in a microwave. Alicia Witt (Zoey, the smart-mouthed daughter on CBS's ""Cybill"") is Natalie, whose biggest problem at the beginning of the film is her creepy Goth roommate's active sex life. Rebecca Gayheart, of ""Scream 2,"" is Natalie's best friend, Brenda. Jared Leto (Claire Danes' dream guy on ABC's ""My So-Called Life"") is Paul, the blue-eyed student reporter whom both girls are attracted to. Joshua Jackson (Pacey of the WB's ""Dawson's Creek"") is everybody's pal Damon. Loretta Devine, from ""Waiting to Exhale,"" plays the only admirable adult, a campus security officer who likes to practice her pistol-firing stance while watching Pam Grier movies. Audiences may guess the identity of the killer, although clues point in several different directions toward the end of the film, but the original motive is skillfully hidden until the last minute. Appropriately, the final encounters take place on a dark and stormy night (although the rain stops mysteriously just long enough for Natalie and Brenda to run, terrified, through the woods for a few minutes).

147,Sharkey360,Scream wanna-be (mini-spoiler),4,22 September 2000,"I can't help but feel that Urban Legend is a Scream imitator. We have an interesting cast, some cool secrets learned, some interesting history, etc. What makes this feel like a Scream imitator is the use of suspense, slasher-chasing-victim scenes and the use of unpredictability among the cast.Suspense is good but not as many as I hoped. The slasher-chasing-victim scenes have expression but felt predictable. As for the use of unpredictability, I admit I kept on guessing who's the guilty one, ala Scream. The revelation of the guilty one caught me by surprise.The story of the film feels kinda weak when compared to Scream, but then again it's not the priority here. Alicia Witt is the only good performer here, and it's great that she's the lead. While nowhere as expressive or emotional as Scream's Sydney Prescott, Alicia fits well as Natalie, who at times, does not feel right as a victim. Robert Englund of Nightmare on Elm Street-fame is here, but his exposure is way too short.People who edited this film deserve a huge slap in the face. There was a part when the guilty one stabbed Natalie on her tummy with a small surgical knife, and it bled a good amount. Shortly after that scene, Natalie got untied, stood up and went on with the story...if you looked carefully, she does not look and does not feel any pain or injury. She should be getting weaker, wanting to go to the nearest medical center, holding her tummy more to stop bleeding, and there should be more blood from her!
Overall, Urban Legend is a below-average film as it tried to ride on Scream's success. While this film is no match for any Scream movie, I find this film better than I Know What You Did Last Summer.",Urban Legend
148,timefreezer7,If you liked the Scream and Last Summer movies make sure you don't miss this atmospheric thriller,8,15 December 2003,"A local college is being terrorized by brutal murders. The mysterious killer targets a certain group of friends who initially do not realize, or even ignore, the upcoming danger and fall prey to   his clutches. They leave their rooms unlocked or go alone in the forest at night. The killer's main victim seems to be Natalie (Alicia Witt) a very typical gal, at least on the surface. The killer stalks her and harasses her continuously and Natalie not only tries to convince everyone about the danger in vain, but has to deal with melanic issues from her past. People soon start dropping like flies and Natalie and her friends are helpless before they all meet their fate. Many years before the incidents the college was rumored to have been plagued by an insane professor who flipped and invaded the students' dormitory killing many fraternity members at one single night. One of the few survivors is proven to be a sociopath weird janitor who is not willing to share his traumatic memories in order to help solving the mystery of this new killing spree. The murderer is much more than a freaked loser copycat who simply wants to rekindle the horror on the 25th anniversary of the alleged massacre, but has an obscure agenda.Maybe all these plot elements sound stereotyped and nothing special. The premise of a horror movie localized in a college is as old as it gets and has been done to death (no pun intended). Nevertheless there is a special originality in this film. The killer's modus operandi follows a unique pattern of an urban legend methodology. You probably all know what an urban legend is. Folklore stories which are always laying on the verge of reality and myth. Usually they are scary crimes and everyone seems to know or have heard or have read a similar crime although no one seems to have actually enlisted specific names. Stories like these are usually typical frightening tales. One example is the poisoned candy children are frequently treated on Halloween by insane people. Another example is the seemingly normal father who mysteriously brutally slaughtered his entire family over one night, preferably by axe, and disappeared never to be heard of again. The screenwriter plays cleverly with all the cliches and the fears of the dark. The urban legends provide fertile ground for some genuinely original and shocking death scenes. Urban Legend, despite an intriguing premise, cannot hide its  origin. It is a typical 90's horror film mixed with a whodunit subplot, recognizable TV faces and plenty of gore. The film succeeds in being a memorable and above average effort but if you are set to watch it you are bound to find all the stupid overused themes a teeny bopper provides (without nudity though: that is the determinant between 80's and 90's). There are plot holes the size of a volcano crater. For example the police officers are so dim witted that they regard a clearly obvious strangulation which would probably have left distinct bruises on the victim's neck as a suicide. Moreover why, oh why don't they send officers during the climactic tragic events after all those murders. I can accept the fact that the phone lines were dead but couldn't someone just go and ask for help? When they do arrive it is far too late. The cast was also over-crowded and it was obvious that the protagonists were nothing more than screen fillers. It is too bad since their acting skills, which seemed promising, were withheld. For example Jared Leto and Michael Rosenbaum are Paul and Parker respectively. Although the film starts off interestingly with equal screen time, Natalie soon wins the absolute focus and their roles are so small that they end up being extras. Things are even worse for Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) and Sasha (Tara Reid) who also had shrunken roles and are wandering pretty faces waiting in line to be sliced and diced. Although the suspects are many, the final revelation of the killer is weak, the motives even weaker and of course we have the inevitable cat-lived nature of the killer-who-refuses-to-die escorted by the predictable cliffhanger epilogue with the ""TO BE SEQUELED"" sign.An extra detrimental element is the presence of Alicia Witt in an especially important role. Her acting is not awful but it is definitely misguided and fails. Witt is way too calm to convince as a realistic character. After a certain point it is clear that her psychopath stalker has not only killed her friends, but is after her, and she doesn't even show a trace of panic. She DOES try of course to warn the bonehead authorities and she does a little research on the urban legends. The bad thing is that even in the gruesome finale she doesn't seem to fear the maniac even a little bit and even worse she is not the willing-to-fight heroine that Sidney Prescott in Scream was. Now I don't want to be misunderstood, I wasn't looking for Jamie Lee Curtis's overblown vocal pipes but she could have more human reactions, especially after the deaths of her friends. It's as though Natalie had read the victim list and knew that she had a contractual commitment to survive until the end. The only one of the main characters with some substance is Joshua Jackson as Damon. This guy is a derivative from other horror films and strikes as a cardboard cutout: a prankster who teases his friends and is slightly horny. At least Damon has a certain and sensible persona and Jackson is adequate. The funniest aspect of the film is that the cameos are far more successful and memorable than the leads!! Danielle Harris in a short role is the quite trendy Gothic young diva who is the incarnation of the Lust sin, the aged John Neville is the strict and by the rules Dean of the University and Brad Dourif gives an excellent performance in a role which I won't reveal. The best of them is Robert Englund as the clever and a bit creepy Professor who teaches folklore and introduces his students to the urban legends. Professor Wexler seems to be the chief suspect for this horrific situation and although there are sporadic hints throughout the film which point to other directions, Englund virtually dominates the screen even with his absence!!! Of course I won't omit Loretta Devine as Reese the guardian of the University who is very funny and adds the necessary comic relief. Who could have thought? A woman and indeed a black one as the cop/protector. It is another attempt to break a few cliches. Well done casting directors.Apart from some good performances Urban Legend has many other assets. The opening sequence alone was enough to keep me hooked on as I realized I would watch a great film. The rainy frames and the professional shooting with the distant take angles is enough to pose the threatening tone and warn us about what is to follow. The introductory scene is a stand alone masterpiece. The killer here doesn't have a costume but hides under a winter jacket with a cowl and this gives a realistic touch and a difficulty in pinpointing the culprit since many people have the same type of jacket. The best part of Urban Legend is the setting and the cinematography. The university buildings are bulky and old enough to support a medieval atmosphere which excites our imagination. Further, these baroque aged buildings give a much more scary climate and ensure that no matter how much they run, the protagonists will never get away since the corridors are so long that probably no one is going to hear them scream. But the greatest virtue is the photography which was dreary and gave a sense of a documentary style. The best example to describe the stigma the director tried to pull off are the library scenes. The leads are in a situation reminiscent of the Name of the Rose (lacking the religious undertones of course!!!) and are trapped in an infernal game they cannot escape. The whole point of view of the movie is clearly cinematic and the imaging techniques are much supportive. As I aforementioned the death scenes are fascinating and catapult the adrenaline to heights. Although the character development is bare you feel sorry for the victims (well, OK, for most of them). One surprise follows another as the body count increases. It comes as a great disappointment therefore that after a chilling 90 minutes period, the last 30 minutes go downhill. The action is very weak, the suspense retreats and we are left with overacting, inept and predictable ""plot twists,"" inadequate explanations and a rather disappointing climax . I mean how could anyone not wonder why the maniac wouldn't just kill Natalie and get over with this revenging mission instead of doing this wild carnage. So be warned: the last half hour is extremely disappointing. Thus, if you are a horror fan who wants an entertaining thriller Urban Legend is a good shot. Despite some letdowns Urban Legend is yet another landmark in 90's horror genre. URBAN LEGEND - 8 / 10",Urban Legend
149,helencmm,Full of clichés...,5,29 June 2019,"I definitely feel that this film gave me nothing. Really nothing. It was full of clichés, as I've mentioned, and there wasn't a plot twist (at least to me).Firstly, the clichés. I felt that I was watching a film, that desperately wanted to be better than ""Scream"" and to get all of its cult following. The concept, although it was about urban legends, something that I appreciated, it had many vibes from other slasher films, so I think that it lacks of authenticity.Second, I knew who was going to die, and I could tell easily, during the film, which deaths were ""fake"", the ones that wanted to shock you a little bit.Third, the characters. I mean, they managed to make even the characters to act in a cliché way. There was the serious final girl, the one whom they try to mislead you that he or she is the killer, but he's or she's not. The over the top excited person, the idiot prank boy, the blonde bimbo, the goth, and the a*****e! Nothing new, nothing creative.As I've said, I knew 90% of what was going to be happen, so I haven't felt any thrilling moment. Except one scene.Let's say the things that I liked about this film. First of all, the concept of the urban legends it was cool, and maybe the only prototypical. I also liked the first scene. It was actually very thrilling and gave me a very good first impression. The person who played the killer was cool and had good acting skills.To conclude this review, I want to mention that this film is not necessarily bad, but to me it wasn't good either. It was something between ""Scream"" and ""I Know what you did Last Summer"". Plus urban legends. As a person that have seen many many similar Films, I have to say that I kind of knew the flow of the plot, so I did not found it thrilling. If you've never seen similar Films, maybe you'll like it. It's a fun film to watch, if you don't have anything to do.",Urban Legend
150,Criz,One of the Greatest Horror Films of All Time,10,30 March 1999,"""Urban Legend"" is one of the most creative, inspired horror films in a long, long time. Funny, twisted and fresh, it manages to out-Scream ""Scream""--that is, it pokes fun at the horror genre, but pulls it off better than the Kevin Williamson-written flicks.

151,sublime501,A basic teen slasher movie that's just slightly above the rest of the pack.,5,20 June 2004,"URBAN LEGEND is the story of a college campus invaded by a serial killer. (Sound familiar?) Among the students at this college are Paul (Jared Leto), Natalie (Alicia Witt), Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), and Sasha (Tara Reid). However, this serial killer has a bit of a different intention. He/she kills people by way of old urban legends that were never really true... until now.Although the premise of URBAN LEGEND is much more interesting and original than that of most teen slasher movies, it's still a very mediocre movie. Some of the actors, i.e. Alicia Witt and Jared Leto, are actually good actors, but they're given nothing to work with and thus don't show their talent. The screenplay is bad and at times even ridiculous, especially Natalie's flashback sequence and the scene in which the killer confesses his/her motive. Speaking of which, those scenes are total cliches, and there are many more of those horror film cliches present in this movie, including the helpless, defenseless girls who get killed, the inevitable hookup, and the crazy old man at the gas station.However, this movie does have a couple of good points. The premise, as I said, is pretty intriguing and original, and there are a couple of good twists in the plot. One minute you're convinced that one person did it, then your mind gets changed in a matter of minutes. The ending, too, is somewhat clever and almost chilling, surprisingly.A couple of good points can't save URBAN LEGEND, however. It's another teen slasher flick that's slightly above the rest of the pack, but still very mediocre. Jared Leto's hot though. 5/10.",Urban Legend

153,bigwig_thalyi,different look.........,8,27 October 2005,"Contrary to popular opinion,I thought this was a well crafted horror movie that though not a classic horror still had it moments and enough uncertainty to keep you on the edge of your seat. Alicia Witt,of Cybill fame,is a college student who finds out that people on campus are being murdered by someone using deaths as recounted in the myths of urban legend. As she delves into the ever increasing number of deaths she fears she could be next. This film had its fair number of killings ,some pretty graphic and some not so graphic.The scene with the little dog was a bit too graphic for my taste and unnecessary in my opinion but that is only a minor quibble. Alicia Witt is a good solid heroine and the supporting cast does well.Joshua Jackson,from Dawsons Creek,is impressive though he is only in it for a short while before he is routinely dispatched by the killer. Robert Englund puts in a good performance as a teacher of urban legend folklore and it was nice to see him in a role that didn't involve him killing teens in their dreams. This may not be a purists type of horror movie but for someone like me who enjoys sitting down in front of a decent slasher movie it is a pretty decent flick.",Urban Legend

Of course not.  Or is it? After this opening scene and the girl drives off it is all DOWNHILL.  Too many cliches. The only thing different is the concept ( a serial killer copying URBAN LEGENDS).  Robert Englund (aka Freddy Krueger), is professor William Wexler, why is he in this movie? This movie is all too predictable, from the campus ""wanna-be"" cop to the Dean, to the students.

I knew the killer less than FIFTEEN MINUTES after the opening, and this is one of those films where you're supposed to learn who the killer is only in the very end. Even Robert Englund cannot save this movie with others acting so bad. And speaking of bad actors: who is that ugly girl killed in the very beginning, the one driving the car in the rain? She has to be the worst ""actress"" I have ever seen. She can't do ANYTHING, she can't speak, she can't sing, she can't walk, and she most certainly couldn't act even if she took 1000 acting classes. If you think you've seen a bad, wooden actress, take a look at this one... Apart from the quite good, ambient score, there is one good thing about this movie (probably especially for a non-American viewer :) - you learn a good deal about nice urban legends. The movie actually inspired me to hunt for those on the Net and then write an article on them - for this I'm thankful. :)",Urban Legend
157,very_doubtful,It just doesn't seem to stop...,5,24 March 2000,"Here it is, the next film going for the ""Scream"" audience. Again the end product is a more or less poor attempt of making a movie with the quality of ""Scream"". And again the film-makers tried to be original and again they failed for the most part.A killer that is imitating urban legends. Basically that's all the story is about. Nonetheless there are a few cool scenes (but I won't spoil them for you). The death scenes are sometimes inventive but can't make this film look any better. It is also weird at times. Suddenly all of the persons were wearing the same coat so that everyone could have been the killer (very original). And there is the final twenty or so minutes: terrible. It starts off weird, then gets ridiculous and finally it is illogical. The actor/actress playing the killer did a poor job. Trying to act like a psychotic, freakish person he/she gets more and more ridiculous and I just couldn't help laughing at him/her. Then they were trying to be original (again this word) by showing one last surprise at the very end but even there they were unsuccessful.Another mistake is that nearly all the interesting (or at least not-so-boring) characters are being killed off in the first half of the film. The only highlight in this film is Robert Englund (whether he is killed or not you will find out when/if watching the film).But maybe I'm being a little hard. The film is still entertaining but the comedy elements are definitely better than the scenes that are supposed to scare you out of your Alicia wi(t)ts (hahaha, I'm so incredibly funny). If you can survive the rest then you will probably have a few laughs and two or three nice scenes.By the way: Don't watch the trailer if you haven't seen the film yet. It would spoil the best joke.My rating: 5/10 (Hopefully they don't think about shooting a sequel)",Urban Legend
158,jwtrox08706,Ehhh...not bad...but no sequel was necessary,6,4 March 2008,"When this came on television the other day, I thought I'd sit back and watch it. I'm definitely one experiencing a major nostalgia for the '90s, especially the late '90s. In addition to that, I had never seen this film before, and it features two actresses I happen to like, Alicia Witt and Danielle Harris (even though Danielle's character is short lived). The acting wasn't terrible in it, but I was never really scared by this film, so points deducted there. I was, however and quite embarrassingly, stumped as to who was offing all of the people. I liked the homage to Halloween at the end with all of the dead bodies popping up inside the abandoned residence hall as the heroine comes to the aid of someone she thinks is a friend in need, when Alicia's character finds her best friend laid out on a bed in the all too familiar image that Jamie Lee Curtis saw in Halloween, and when the killer is blasted out of a top story window by someone shooting him/her out the window. And one more homage: the dead dog (killing a dog via microwave...innovative...but yuck...just in there for some shock value). The acting wasn't terrible, although I just couldn't stand Josh Jackson. He was okay in the Mighty Ducks films, but when it came to this film...uh-uh. What was with his bleached hair? Was he even thinking? Points deducted for that. Alicia Witt did a decent job of playing the heroine. And my hat goes off to the legendary Brad Dourif, playing Michael McDonnell the creepy but innocent stu-stu-stu-stuttering g-g-g-g-g-gasss st-sta-sta-station at-t-t-tendant, ""Someone's in the back...SEAT!"". Classic. But for the most part, the film follows many clichés that horror films have fallen into. It's almost unavoidable.

159,YungRapunxel212,So many twists...,8,3 June 2013,"I like this movie. Jared Leto and Rebecca Gayheart star in it. The movie is about a college student who suspects murders around the campus are linked to urban legends. The girls friend, Paul (Jared Leto) believes her, but her other friend, Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) isn't to sure. Some urban legends in the movie are ""Aren't You Glad You Didn't Turn on the Lights"", which involves a girl getting killed in the dark while her roommate walks in, suspecting she is having ""fun"", the urban legend where the babysitter is phoned by a killer in the house, which they made a movie of, called ""When a Stranger Calls"". Gory. Spoilers - - - - the main girl Natalie discovers all the bodies with Brenda. The urban legends are gory too. Not scary. I personally loved the ending.End Spoilers - Paul and Natalie push the killer - who is Brenda - off of a dock into water.

Natalie (Alicia Witt) has reason to believe a serial killer who's using urban legends as inspiration for the murders they've been committing on her college campus has singled her out as their next victim.It's hard to tell if Natalie is written as a whiny and fun-free young woman or if Alicia Witt brought that aspect out in her or maybe a mix of both, but she's only convincing in the big horror scenes where she does manage to look appropriately terrified and on edge.

162,davidhutch007,Nice Horror With A Nice Story!,6,30 June 2006,"Ever since its release I've been dying to see this (pun intended)and today after many long years i have finally seen it, and i wasn't disappointed.The premise of the film is that somebody is killing off campus members by using urban legends. This entails some very interesting and very unique deaths that i have not seen before in other horror films. The story is very good and shy's away from the typical idea of teens getting picked off by some killer in a mask, the story leads to much more than that typical affair that has been set by the Scream franchise.Of course with every horror film you have to expect some stereotypes, and in this case it is the characters. The typical sex craving busty blonde's etc also the typical scream fest of the woman being chased down the dark hallways by the crazed killer. Now this can become tedious but thankfully this does not happen a lot in the film as it frequently does with others so your ears are spared.The film opens strongly although not as strong as say the opening to Scream, but this film opens with a kill that sets the tone of what is to come and also we get to see Brad Douriff play a small role with big assets to the film. Also Robert Englund makes an appearance as a creepy Professor who makes a couple of good jump in your seat moments and also Englund gives a unique performance way off from Freddy Kruger which isn't a bad thing really.The rest of the cast are not really memorable in any way, although i did think Jared Leto and Joshua Jackson put in a good performances although i do think Jacksons character was a little under used as he did have a good character.The look of the film is typical for the genre with the darkness and the low key lighting making it just the same as any other horror film you have seen before. The campus was a great setting and created some great opportunities for the atmosphere of the film.The direction is good in places and only very rarely does it seem to let up which is good and the director builds tension with ease but the final scare never really seems to come which is a shame because the tension is well built.Overall the film wont win any awards for being a fantastic horror film because the horror films of today never are as good as the classics and also these films will always be compared to the Scream franchise and films like I Know What You Did Last Summer but this films i think belongs up their with them, although not as good as say Scream this film offers new ideas to what is becoming a tiered genre and i think if you are a horror buff like me, just check it out its worth a look! ****** out of **********",Urban Legend

An interesting plot seems to promise more Scream-style fun. The film starts off on the right foot with a terrific opener but as soon as it begins to rely on that same sort of ripped-off, pretentious '90s teeny-bopper dialogue pioneered by Kevin Williamson (who himself had adapted from various other hip-talking films, one of which was without a doubt THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE), the viewer can see just how serious the crew is about this film. Not very much.Though it often benefits from it's carefree attitude toward fronting itself as a horror film, and there are some great one-liners, and the leading actresses Witt and especially, Gayheart are excellent, the movie falls short of delivering the goods for horror fans. And the majority of supporting characters serve up this hokey dialogue, so I end up rooting for the killer, who doesn't have much common sence which also makes it hard to appreciate the eventual evolution into an immortal Robo-killer.In conclusion, I like the killer's confession scene. Funny killer. But while the movie is mildly entertaining, it's too hokey and does go overboard a bit on the body count.

Take the plot, for instance, the movie wants to pass itself as being about a killer on campus that crafts murders according to the most known urban legends. But, the thing is that by the end of the movie, we find that the plot is a simple rehash of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. It really has nothing to do with urban legends.

I've heard that this has so many copy scenes but the feel that the story and the characters make me think of no connections during the viewing unless I was told to create an educational assignment of connections.  The acting was far from bad and it was really quite convincing.  The movie presented many ideas of Legends and was never boring or tiresome.  There was always the constant surprise and even though I an  not easily scared I can be Alarmed and this film has many ""jumpers""  that made me tilt back.  The movie presented many teenage characters and the mystery of who was the killer was enchanting because there were so many choices--one being Robert Englund and a very creepy old janitor.  However,  the killer in the end is the one that I would never expect and this made the surprise all the more bizarre.  The killer's EXTREME CHANGE was very looney and I would never guess-only in the second viewing I realized some obvious clues. This movie is surpringly not graphically gory,  they do the majority of murders on the side which surprises me since this is an intended horror movie.

There are cheap jump scares, a twist ending, and inept authority figures. In spite of all this, I really loved this movie. The kills are brutal and mean, and they're very creative for the most part. The opening scene put a huge smile on my face. The characters are standard, but I liked them. Natalie is our final girl, but she was probably the most boring character in the movie. Jared Leto plays Paul, the campus reporter, and he doesn't even look much older nowadays! Other characters include Brenda, Natalie's best friend; Damon, the practical joker; Tosh, the goth roommate; Reese, campus security; Parker, the frat guy; and Sasha, the sexy radio DJ. The movie is a whodunit, so we're constantly guessing who the killer might be. Apart from the opening, I'd say my favorite scene would have to be Sasha's chase at the radio station. It's the classic scene with a hot girl in a tiny dress being chased through the hallways by the crazy killer. There's an urban legend twist though, because her screams for help are broadcast over the radio so all her friends hear her die. It's an awesome scene with good camera-work and lighting and music. All in all, Urban Legend is a fun watch, with some classic scenes and a few famous actors in cool roles. Give it a chance!",Urban Legend

It looks like the director thinks that showing a bit of blood and gore, and 'spooky' music makes a film scary, and it just doesn't do it.The ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" films were far better at getting the audience involved with the characters - I really didn't care aboutanyone in this film.

Alicia witt is ok as Natalie, we do feel sorry for her a little but they needed a more stronger actress to carry the film. Rebecca gayheart is almost awful as brenda. every line she gives out is just bad. jared let isn't too good either. in fact he's done better in other films.I know it sounds like i think it's the worse movie ever. i don't. the film has some entertainment value and the opening scene itself is a reason to see the film, but the script is horrible and the acting isn't great. this is what prevents urban legend from becoming a good film.

But THIS movie was so bad it made the bad 80s flicks (Friday the 13th...) look good.There wasn't a single fresh idea in this movie nor a single surprise.  The identity of the killer is supposed to ""shock"" us, but it is just done for the sake of surprise and it wasn't all that surprising at all if you look at it from that standpoint.The worst part of this movie were the lame attempts to scare the audience that were the usual false alarms interspersed with the real thing -- none of which was scary or suspenseful.  The characters are all one-dimensional and with the exception of Alicia Witt, the acting is inferior as well.  Rebecca Gayheart is particularly pathetic.Even if you like horror movies, avoid this one like the plague.",Urban Legend
173,crousbrandon,GREAT SCARY SLASHER FILM,9,30 October 2019,"This is a great interesting slasher film, with great mystery and suspense. We have a cast of good actors who all do well by their roles. Especially Rebecca Gayheart she shines in this movie!!.The whole idea of an urban legend serial killer is a very interesting premise. And it definitely pays off! We get some great urban legend kills. I really liked the chase sequence with Sasha, suspenseful, I actually thought she was going to make it but unfortunately not. Also the killer uses an axe allot in the scenes which is great, I've always liked am axe as a weapon in a horror movie and it used well so little. We get some great cameos by Brad dourif from chucky and Robert England from a nightmare on elm street, although I'd say he has more of a prominent role than brad dourif who plays a stuttering gas station attendee at the beginning of the film. Great red herrings!! You'll never guess the killerAllot of people call this film a scream rip off, and trust me its not, it has its own story and own great mystery, yes it might be a post scream slasher, but its not a copy at all and one of the better if not the best post scream slasher. One of my friends even controversially said its better than scream, I cannot choose between the twoOverall Very good movie and it was shot very well!!
Enjoy",Urban Legend
174,up2u,Not bad at all.,7,25 September 1998,"This spin-off of Scream is the most original slasher film since that, telling the tale of a serial killer making urban legends become real on a college campus. Scary and entertaining, though higly predictable (you could guess the killer, the victims and the survivors off the top of your head). Good performances by Alicia Witt, Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Gayheart, although Jared Leto seemed a bit stiff. A nice scary movie that is very enjoyable. Make sure to buy popcorn for this one!",Urban Legend
175,Isau,"Good premise, but movie loses it",4,17 March 1999,"This movie could have been very scary, but is instead somewhat laughable. The killer in many scenes appears to be psychic, knowing exactly where his intended  victims are and how they're going to react when he strikes.  It all sort of comes off like the Scooby Doo gang in a horror movie.  Still, the acting isn't bad, and people who are fans of cheesy 80's horror will probably enjoy this flick despite its flaws.",Urban Legend

It took the main idea (urban legends-the man with the hook) from ""I Know"" and the direction and the script reminded us of Scream. Not very scary neither gory but mysterious. You will never find out who the killer is till the end. You will get surprised but it won't be a ""good"" surprise. Silly end (the director wanted us to understand that is going to be a sequel, but as I see the sequel has nothing to do with this movie, actually that's good because we will see a new idea based on urban legends. After all it might be as the movie I had thought of before I watch it. I got bored of Scream-type horror movies. I want something new and original with teens) 6/10",Urban Legend
177,Caustic Pulp,Absolutely horrifying...,3,27 April 2000,"...but not in the way you're hoping it is. Oh no. No, Urban Legend is awful. I mean really bad. It's craptastic.First of all, it's part of the genre that's killing good horror: teen horror. I can't stand movies that feature ""hot, fresh young stars"" and try to pander themselves to the teenage audience. Absolute crap like the Scream trilogy, Teaching Mrs. Tingle, and the I Know Who You Boffed on Tuesday movies. Kevin Williamson should be strung up by his intestines for inventing the worst movie genre in the history of man, an atrocity to my favorite movie genre.But that doesn't even begin to explain what's so abysmal about this movie. Anybody who has ever taken a serious interest in urban legends is going to be mortified by this movie. Urban legends themselves are pretty ambiguous and the story changes from person to person, but there are always a few constants. To avoid spoilers, I won't mention any in particular, but I'd like to point out that every single urban legend featured in this movie has been perverted beyond recognition. They aren't the real urban legends. They're ""interesting ways to kill people."" And had the movie been marketed that way, it might have been more appealing.So let's recap. Crappy cast. Horrible writing. Lousy direction. No thrills, chills, or spills. Awful kills. And above all...desecration of one of the most interesting parts of American culture.Yeah, Urban Legend sucks.",Urban Legend

The results were worse than expected. I am ashamed to admit I paid to see it.The script here is the big flaw. The characters go through the whole movie telling each other these ghost stories, these ""urban legends"", while somebody acts them out by killing their peers in the fashion mentioned in the stories. There is also a creey teacher (played by Robert Englund, Freddy himself) who teaches a course on Urban Legends, and most of the victims were in his class. That is about as interesting as the film ever gets.The script is filled with corny, over-the-top dialogue and teen sex jokes (""Word of advice, back away from the volcano before it erupts"") sure to make all the 13 year old boys giggle.The movie then drags on, people die, and those alive accuse all the wrong people until they either get picked off themselves or they discover the real one.

181,kmhf-25079,It is Time to be Dead!,4,21 June 2021,"In the nineties of the last century, there was a real boom in Hollywood for youth horror films, where the role of the antagonist was assigned to a maniac with an axe. Naturally, the squarelogy ""Scream"" stands here, which in general is not surprising, because in addition to the fact that the franchise was a completely independent product, it also ridiculed its fellow genre. But in addition to it, other franchises saw the light, the creators of which tried to shoot a serious youth horror movie without any hints of jokes and jokes. And today's review will focus on just such a film. So, these are ""Urban Legend(s)"".A quiet student town. The students who live in it, according to their mental development, have not gone far from the boys and girls who study in the third grade of elementary school, because they can still get dressed without help, and putting two and two together is a million-dollar task for them. One can only wonder, as in America, what boasts of its education system, such spirited students? Well, it doesn't matter. And the important thing is that the owners of the Darwin Prize are being hunted by a man in a hood, who, when killing another student, is guided by urban legends. Well, the inhabitants of Pendlton University, beware of a crocodile in the sewer!In fact, the viewer could see impenetrably stupid students even in the movie epic about the adventures of Jason Voorhees, and such behaviour became something like the norm in youth horror films, if not for one ""but"". And it lies in the fact that at the very beginning of the picture, the viewer is shown a resourceful young girl (by the way, not bad played by Natasha Gregson Wagner), who even took a pepper spray with her, and managed to knock out the glass with a chair, in general, the first victim of a maniac behaved herself as any normal person would behave in a similar situation. And actually it gave hope that everything would not be so bad and the students would be able to evoke feelings in addition to - ""When will they just kill you all?"" But hopes are dispelled when the viewer is shown the main character of this picture, a girl named/nicknamed Nicole (or Natalie, who cares? I'm personally want to call her by the name ""Nicole"", I can't help myself, for me ""Nicole"" is more appropriate to her than ""Natalie"", and so this girl will be called by that name next in my text). In essence, this is the same Nicole should be (on scenario) a tragic character, who needs to be empathized by the viewers with in every possible way - her best friend recently was killed, with whom the girls (as it later surfaced later) at one time brutally killed a man, accidentally, true, but still. She lives with a Goth neighbour, in any case, the screenwriters of the picture are trying to convince the viewers that Nicole's neighbour is exactly that Goth, although the girl (Tosh) has both friends of interest (with whom she most actively communicates on the Internet) and a young man (with whom she ""meets"" regularly in her and Nicole dorm room, hee-hee-hee), and Nicole herself has no one and she is constantly locked in herself. Substitution of concepts? Well, I have already encountered this. And also our unfortunate Nicole has friends who do not bully the girl, but with serious faces ask if everything is all right with her, and are ready to help in a difficult moment. In general, Nicole is an egoist girl, whose acting is able to compete with the facial expressions of pokerface, and all she is capable of is at times (when it is impossible to do without it in any way) improbably yell. What a ""deep and interesting character"", don't you think?But what about the girl's friends, fellow students? Maybe they will be able to hook the viewer with something? No, they can't, because all the characters in this picture fall under the definition of ""these people should die at the twentieth minute of the film,"" because the actors play at the same level as the performer of the main role, which means that the audience is presented with a matinee arranged by a certain family of stones. No, of course, Robert ""Kruger"" Englund and Jared Leto are present in the picture, but if too little screen time is given to the first, then the second starred in this picture just for nothing to do, and therefore does not try to play much. And it's a pity, because if the main character was not Alicia Witt, who could squeeze out exactly one and a half emotions, but Jared Leto, then the film would only benefit from this. But not fate.Well, how is the situation with the slasher component? Well, do you know, some kind of piercing-cutting objects that pierce the bodies of teenagers, or memorable deaths, whether it's a toilet bowl that fell on the head of one of the heroes or a can of pepsi, in which there would be sulfuric acid instead of soda? But nothing.For the murders themselves - they take place in complete darkness, and the viewer only will see what the hero was like before communicating with the killer, and what he became after. And yes, the changes are purely cosmetic and they come down to ketchup on the wrists and faces of these unfortunate people. And it seemed to me that one of the key ideas of any slasher was to show how creative a killer can be, especially trying to bring to life the urban legends of America. But, apparently, I'm behind the times.Summing up, I would like to say that there is an atmosphere of tense expectation in the film, but it only works in the wrong direction. Heroes (except Tosh, who I'm personally like because of Adorable, Wonderful and Unforgettable for me Danielle Harris, actress, who in this film (and in every of Her films she did!) really dedicate herself to Her Character Tosh - bold, rude, vulgar, too free-spirited maybe, but for me just mentally unstabled, Poor Little Girl, who lost her way in life, and who for me, Didn't Deserve such cruel, cynical and treacherous Death, in which I much more blame even not a killer himself, but Nicole, who was cold-hearted, irritated and somewhat, I feel it personally, even envied to Tosh's popularity among guys (Goth guys, and so what?), she could take just one motion by herself, and murder (maybe, as a killer had planned it at the first place) couldn't be done, but she didn't even bother in her mind, what's really going on, and as a result killer succeed in his vile and disgusting intentions) do not cause sympathy, but directly opposite feelings, and from that I want the killer to come and do something terrible with them. With the plot, the creators also overdid it, making a murderer of someone from whom you do not expect this in any way, and not only because this hero had successfully pretended to be kind all the time before, but because he simply physically could not do what he did. And explanations like ""why and for what important reasons for him he does this"" are far-fetched, in my purely subjective opinion, by white threads, and somehow you don't really believe in them. I didn't hear any musical accompaniment at all, in addition to the wonderful cool song ""Crop Circle"" by ""Monster Magnet"", which Tosh (as a 12 year old, when I first watched this, I dreamed that I would have such a cool older sister!)) turned on at full volume on her computer. After all, before her death, she listened to this Great Music, eh...(((( I'm So Sorry for Tosh. Even know, almost 20 years later. She had Taste, Style and Fashion, even strange and creepy, but so, again, unlike Nicole/Natalie, who, I think, just didn't know such words in theory, not mention about practical usement.And as for the actors, as I said, they play below average, which, however, is the norm for this kind of films. And that's why I still advised you to refrain from watching and turn your eyes to the ageless classics of the genre in the face of ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"" and the ""Scream"" that joined their ranks.4 out of 10. I wish you all Health, good luck and all the best. I know that fans of these ""Urban horror stories"" will throw rotten tomatoes at me, belittle and pessimize my point of view in every possible way, but I wrote my review counting on adequate, unbiased, understanding and (most importantly, sic!) accepting someone else's point of view, which can (and should, as I think!) sharply differ from the reference, clearly and firmly established and generally accepted. I am such a person, I am not ashamed at all, and I am proud of it. If I don't like any movie (or in general I have my own point of view on any issues) I am not shy to express it openly, honestly and sincerely, without any fear of condemnation. This is my credo, my main life principle, and no one will ever force me to refuse to follow it. You may not agree with my opinion, but to abandon it or, even more so, force me to join an opinion that is polar different from mine - I ask you to spare me from this.

I have always been interested in urban legends and have read a lot about them. You would here them at Halloween and it used to scare the crap out of me. So i knew i would enjoy this film from the very beginning. There are many reasons that i like this film, one it doesn't take itself too seriously and it also uses humour. There are some very talented actors contributing to this movie as well. I love being scared and this film is short of sudden thrills and jumps. It does keep you guessing as well you always look for the most unlikely person as the killer and your never right in all scary films that i have come across and Urban Legends is no exceptance. It is a fun, scary and jumpy movie that is just waiting to scare the pants off you! If you see it in a rental shop don't hesitate to pick it up you will not be disappointed.

It relies on scares rather than gore, and believe me it is very scary and suspenseful. Although I loved Scream, I found this one more entertaining, and more scarier for several reasons. It makes you jump in just about every scene, it is one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it also keeps you guessing on who the killer is. Once you find out you'll be very surprised. So take my advice and next time instead of renting a predictable, gory scary movie, rent one that is actually scary.

It is one of those you try to guess who the pschyo is, but you'll guess wrong every time. So go see it and believe Me - you'll be checking the back seat every time you get in the car at night.

192,Mac-40,Sweet mother of...,3,3 October 1998,"Let's get something straight:  When a movie makes someone laugh more than scream, it's a comedy.  But if it was meant to be a horror movie, it means that it's a bad horror movie.  That is the case with 'Urban Legend', another slasher flick, ripped off from 'Scream'.  This movie was so lame it was funny.  It was not scary!  However it did startle the people next to me, but not for the reasons you may think.  You see, the camera is framed perfectly so that we don't see what's behind the person.  Then the person will turn around because she thinks someone is there, but everyone is happy there isn't.  Then when she turns back around and- Good God!- it's Joshua from Dawson's creek.  How she didn't see him coming down the hallway before she turned around is beyond me!And then we have the killer.  Someone dressed up as an Eskimo. I'm aware of many of the Urban Legends that are mentioned in the movie and none of them have anything to do with arctic natives. The one thing I do like about this movie:  it fits right into the category of 'slasher' movie.  I will quote a line from the movie 'Scream':  ""It's just about a big breasted girl who can't act getting chased by some psycho in a mask, and she runs up the stairs when she should run outside! It's insulting!""  End quote. And I will say that the acting sucked, although one of them did an okay job.  How many people can say a line like, ""It's like someone knows all the urban legends and wants to turn them into reality!"",  without giggling?  But here, this quote, also from the movie 'Scream', helps define what I think of this movie: ""What's the point?""",Urban Legend
193,Nick_Milligan,"A trashy, poorly written attempt at teen horror",3,29 April 2000,"Urban Legend is a very disappointing film. It breaks absolutely no new ground in the teen horror genre and is incredibly predictable right to the very end. At no point, does Urban Legend even show the slightest signs of realism and in parts, becomes so unrealistic it becomes hard to watch. The performances are not bad, with the likeable prankster Joshua Jackson and a rare performance by horror king, Robert Englund. The cast seems to do well with a very flat, cliched script. It is not made clear whether the killer is human, because from what is presented, it appears that he\she is super human, as he\she survives being shot, falling out of a two story window and flying through a windscreen of a truck over the edge of a bridge into an icy river.

196,David N.,"Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid",2,17 March 1999,"""Urban Legend"" is a moronic film.  I wish I could put it more elegantly than that, but the word ""moronic"" fits the film perfectly.  This is a carefully constructed attempt to cash in on the teen-slasher market, nothing more.  It has no flair, logic, imagination, or spirit.  I only hope tripe like this has had its day at the box office.Every cliche in the book is used in ""Urban Legend.""  People jumping out at each other from the dark and then asking, ""What are you so jumpy about?"" The weirdo who has some knowledge about the murders that are occurring.  The massive cast of characters, each person possibly the killer.  The surprise ending.  And so on and so on.Jared Leto's main character is a bland, arrogant doofus.  I was praying, hoping, wishing that the lame parka-clad killer would gut him like a freshwater trout.  (By the way, how come no one says anything about a person walking around the campus in a parka.  In the _summer_??  And how ridiculous is it that three different people have the SAME parka?? Arrgh!)Alicia Witt is the one bright spot.  Her charisma and ability shine through this muddle, believe it or not.  I will also give credit to Joshua Jackson for abandoning his image and getting slaughtered.The premise of a serial killer knocking off people using urban legends is good, but it falls to the tired old situations that populate movies like this.  The identity of the killer is painfully obvious, just because it is the one character who is so UNobvious.  The showdown is dumb, the surprise ending is laughable, and the final scene is ludicrous.  This pathetic pretender is a big plate of lousy.",Urban Legend
197,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,Great premise that delivers what it promises.,7,20 September 2006,"The movie ""Scream"" has an awful lot to answer for really. The amount of teenager packed, pop culture filled horror movies that have been released in its wake is astonishing. Movies such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legend"" are a direct response to the above movies success. Each involves fantastic looking people being killed one by one by an unknown executioner. They manage to include sex, comedy and popular music and the audience are subjected to cliché scenarios and inevitable twists and turns. It would be so very easy to just dismiss them all as redundant, money making exercises, but to be honest, when they're done well they are thoroughly entertaining despite the obvious plot holes, unrealistic acting and overuse of cheap scares. ""Urban Legend"" is a very good case in point.When students at a fictional university are being slaughtered one by one, it becomes apparent that the killer is using common urban legends to take each of them out. The movie starts with a young woman having her head cut off by someone that had been hiding in the backseat of her car. It's a very effective scene utilizing a story most viewers would have been told at some point, with great camera angles, a thunderstorm to create the appropriate atmosphere and a suitably creepy Brad Dourif whom makes it work. You know what you're in for from this point onwards and while not all the scenarios work as well as this opening they are all reasonably well done. Over the course of the film, the creators manage to make just about every single member of the cast appear to be the assassin. A combination of red herrings and coincidences regularly come into play to confuse and sidetrack. I must admit that the first time I saw the film I had no idea who the killer was until it was revealed, which is a credit to the cast and crew involved.""Urban Legend"", as is the case with many modern horror films, doesn't take itself too seriously. There are clichés all over the place which I guess can be excused considering the theme of the film. It's a little difficult to make things seem fresh when most of the film is actually attempting to clone other well known stories. There are a few too many cheap scares for my liking. You know the ones! A girl walks into a dark library and thinks she's alone. She walks slowly around saying ""hello, is anyone there?"" Then she backs down a corridor only to wander straight into an innocent bystander while the music raises several decibels in an attempt to make the audience jump. Repeat several times throughout the movie and it just becomes really predictable. I guess directors of these horror movies that contain so much comedy really find it hard to build up creepy atmosphere so they simply have to resort to regular little shocks. The movie isn't excessively gory, yet it does include decapitations with axes, people being run over with cars and hangings. There's actually not a lot of blood and most damage occurs slightly off screen. It's also worth noting that a couple of horror legends get some screen time during all the fun. Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger) and the previously mentioned Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) are welcome inclusions.Overall I'd have to say ""Urban Legend"" is an entertaining horror movie with a really great premise. Pretty much none of it is believable (the killer seems to be in two places at once several times and the killer appears to be immortal by the end) but then it really doesn't try to be a serious and realistic film. Its purpose is to give you a fun night in, a few good jolts along with some awesome eye candy for both sexes. I believe it succeeds in exactly what it tries to do and therefore recommend it for those inclined. You know who you are.",Urban Legend

Not to mention a fan of 30 Seconds To Mars so Jared Leto was another reason. This movie is about a killer loose on a fancy college campus who kills a group of friends off using urban legend techniques. The pacing of the movie wasn't bad for the length between the character settings and the kills, but the end is where it gets a bit annoying.

Only this time, there's a twist:  the killer uses urban legends as a template for the murders.  I thought that was a great idea.  Unfortunately, that seems to be my opinion and mine alone. Everyone else has said that this movie was a waste of time, and a ""Scream"" wannabe.  Yeah right, and Rosie O'Donnell has an 18"" waist!  This movie sets its own standards and, as far as quality is concerned, nearly surpasses ""Scream"".  I didn't like it as well as ""I Know..."" and ""I Still Know..."", but I still thought it was great.  Alicia Witt made a big mistake in doing the television show ""Cybill"".  This is because she is actually a pretty decent actress.  I was thoroughly impressed.   A-",Urban Legend

Horror fans may not agree with me, but I think it was kind of stupid. A New England college student decides she's going to to solve a 30-year-old urban legend about a massacre of students at the hands of an abnormal psychology professor. During the process, she discovers that she has been the focus of these murders. Now towards the end, if you ask me, seems sort of a rip-off of ""Scream"". I won't give away the ending, but If you seen ""Scream"" and ""Urban Legend"" you can tell it was a wanna-be of ""Scream"". Like I said before, horror fans may not agree with me, but that's what it seems like. Even though I was expecting more, the film does have its moments.

The first true scary movie for me was Halloween when I was 13 years old. This one is no Halloween, but it was able to make me jump at the right times.

BUT that doesn't mean every horror movie that follows it has to be an exact duplicate. I realise that Urban Legends storyline was by the same guy that worked on Scream but for god's sake, whatever happened to originality. I am sick to death of the drivel mass-marketed/mass-produced snot that is coming from hollywood ala Scream/Scream2/I Know../I still Know../ and now I can add to this Urban Legend.Horror should not follow a formula which has been determined as a) gather attractive cast. b) have them dating each other c) kill them off slowly whilst not knowing who the killer is.GEEE SO ORIGINAL ISNT ITAs the movie itself quotes""Ooh an urban legend serial killer, it's quite a stretch""SURE IS.",Urban Legend
205,TB77,"Quit nice, but still...",6,8 November 1999,"I think ""Urban Legend"" fits nicely into the line of American horror-movies made during the last couple of years, which has a story that takes place at either a high school or a college, and and always seems to have a bunch of good looking students being the main characters. (i.e ""Scream I and II"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" + the latters sequel.)Unfortunately, that's part of this movies' downfall. Because the story in ""Urban Legend"" is a little too similar to the stories in the films just mentioned. So, if this movie had been made before ""Scream"" was released, I'm sure it would have been a much bigger hit than what it became.But, like allready said, it is a good horror movie...So, it's somewhat of a shame that it leaves you with the impression that you've seen it all before.",Urban Legend

A neat premise and an excellent opening scene with a superb cameo by the great Brad Dourif, but then it just morphs into run-of-the-mill stalker/slasher mode. And to top it all off, the killer/killers is/are very easy to spot. But it has got a couple of really good scenes, but it's not exciting and entertaining enough to be scary, which keeps it from being a good horror film. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film by any means, it's well shot and paced, but the acting from basically everyone but Brad Dourif leaves much to be desired. It's okay midnight entertainment when one has little else to do, just don't expect anything from it, and you'll probably be mildly entertained.",Urban Legend

I also liked Rebecca Gayheart, with that -don't-think-i-am-not-psycho-enough-to-kill-you- look. She really looked great in her role. What i didn't like, was the fact that she survived, had new friends, and the film did not have a clear ending. Had the producers decide to make a #2? Who knows... Many say that the script was not that great. OK, I admit it. Many say it wasn't scary. Not THAT scary, but you jump off your seat every now and then.

209,j-kirby247,"Good 90's Slasher, Considering its Competition",7,28 March 2012,"Basic Story Guide: (contains a few minor spoilers) Natalie Simons is attending college at Pendleton University, when the news hits collage that Michelle Mancini, a fellow student at Pendleton, was murdered the previous night. Although the police are focusing on the gas station attendant who last saw Michelle, the killer then strikes again. This time Natalie witnesses the attack but is able to escape, but another college student is not so fortunate. As she is recovering, Natalie makes a realization: Michelle was murdered by a guy in the backseat with an ax, and her class mate was murdered by being hung above a car while Natalie was inside it. All of the murders thus far are being taken from urban legends, and made into horrific reality. And this is only beginning Verdict: Between I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream, and its surprisingly successful sequel, its sister silver screen slasher Urban Legend kind of fell into obscurity, and bordered on the rarely being seen. In spite of this I have only one real problem with it, the woman who played Michelle Mancini acted like she was in a soap opera, even by horror movie standard her acting was horrendous. If you can make it past that, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the movie.The killings in this are unique, and original. In the words of Timothy Olyphant from Scream 2, ""It's all about execution,"" and because of the originality of the murders, I bumped up the number of stars on it. I'm big on originality, when it comes to my horror movies. When you consider it's competition, it's lucky to have even been seen at all. And while it may not stand out as the greatest slasher or horror movie of the 1990's it can still stand on its own two feet.7/10",Urban Legend

After seeing this TERRIBLE Dead Teenager schlock, I did.  Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, and Jared Leto duke it out for worst performance as three college kids who become scared over a killer repeating infamous urban legends (um, didn't we see that in Scream?).  Urban Legend is a cheap, cheap rip-off of such horror classics as Scream, Scream 2, Halloween; such non-classics as I Know What You Did Last Summer and the Halloween sequels; and even Felicity!  Urban Legend is handsdown terrible; but surprisingly only my second least favorite of 1998.

The main girl is so boring and not charismatic at all, and we get to know virtually nothing about the characters, they're all just paper thin stereotypes. It's really sad to see a movie that was made just for money and seems like there was virtually no effort in making it stand out in the slightest.",Urban Legend
212,firetop14,Worth watching,8,13 September 2006,"The story of a serial killer re-enacting urban legends at a university -a simple but effective premise that explores the idea that sometimes the scariest stories are the ones that never happened. As these ""cultural admonitions"" come to life and students start dying, it is up to the main character (Alicia Witt) to find the killer and save herself.Strong writing and directing, and a welcome change from the mediocre or worse horror flicks that emerged from the 90's. The story works on a similar premise to the Scream films but is much darker. Maybe not the scariest horror film around but still highly enjoyable with a chilling menace throughout. Christopher Young's haunting score fits the atmosphere of the film perfectly, as does the lighting that the director uses. There are strong and entertaining performances all round, especially from Michael Rosenbaum and Rebecca Gayheart.Horror movie buffs might also find themselves looking at a few familiar faces. Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund plays a creepy psychology professor. Brad Dourif, the voice of Chucky in the Childsplay films, makes a brief appearance as the stuttering proprietor of a gas station. Finally Danielle Harris, Jamie Lloyd in Halloween 4&5, plays Tosh, Natalie's goth roommate.The death scenes are gruesome and imaginative. The gore isn't OTT because the story is strong enough that it doesn't need to be - a couple of the death scenes are left up to the imagination of the viewer, which is perhaps even worse than actually seeing them. Finally, when the killer is revealed, the motive is interesting and there's a nice twist (or two) right at the end.Definitely worth either renting or buying if you're looking out for the best of 90's horror.",Urban Legend

The performances are all very good (I would watch Alicia Witt do laundry - she's awesome) and there are some excellent scary moments. The killer is a surprise, and the ending actually satisfies, with a plausible, appropriate coda. Also, the little in-jokes add to the enjoyment of the film and are greatly appreciated. My only qualm is that one character is killed off way too early in the film; this character and the actor who plays them should have at least been given a little more time, since the character is one of the most interesting ones in the film.

216,hadar-20,Slasher movie with a script,7,29 May 2001,"Urban Legends is undoubtedly one of the best slasher movies of the nineties. It starts with a marvellous opening scene, and unfolds quite cleverly until the very end. I have seen a lot of films of this type, but I wasn't sure who the killer was until the very end.  Any movie of this type which suceeds in doing that deserves kudos in my book.     compare it to the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, which are basically ""Jason goes around and kills a lot of stupid teenagers"" plot, and you'll see how refreshing Urban Legends is, it actually has a well thought out script! of course it has cliches, but what are slasher movies without them, it's all part of the fun. The thing is it doesn't have TOO MANY cliches. It is better than ""I know what you did last summer"", and comes really close to ""Scream"". The direction deserves a word of praise, Jaimy Blanks first feature is extremely well done and stylish, he learned a lot from his mentor John Carpenter.The cast is uniformly good and believable, and it even has humor, as a self-concious modern flick should. It has minor flaws, but I won't be petty, considering what Horror buffs usually have to deal with, this is a treat.",Urban Legend
217,wolfee37,An original slasher,7,18 March 2006,"After a tacky opening sequence featuring Natasha Gregson Wagner getting slaughtered by the killer with an axe hiding in the backseat of her car, Urban Legend tells the story of a group of pretty college students at a remote New England university. The focus of the story is Natalie (Alicia Witt), a beautiful, academically-gifted student at the fictional Pendleton University. Natalie and her friends (who include Jared Leto as a brash journalist, Rebecca Gayheart as her best friend, Michael Rosenbaum as the party-hardy boy, Joshua Jackson as a practical joker and Tara Reid as the sexy campus DJ) are all involved in the Folklore class being taught by Professor Wexler (Robert Englund). Wexler regales his class with urban legends, which include Pendleton's own urban legend about a Psych professor who murdered six students at Stanley Hall 25 years ago. Natalie is the first one to suspect there's a killer on campus, especially after she has ties to all of the victims. First, it's her high school friend, a guy she's in the woods with at night, her roommate (Danielle Harris), including her friends, Wexler, Dean Adams (John Neville) and security guard (Loretta Devine), of course, no one believes her until it's too late and everyone begins to die according to famous urban legends, and Natalie believes it's all tied to a dark and horrible secret from her past. Now she finds that she and her friends are part of the killer's ultimate urban legend--the story of their own horrific deaths...This slasher flick is extremely satisfactory and it is very very original. The acting seems to be good and the dialogue is decent. The only problem is that the first death is quite stupid but luckily Tara Reid's chase scene is very well done (but not as good as Sarah Michelle Gellar's from I Know what you did last summer).",Urban Legend

I first saw like half of it on TV and then, over a year of looking, I found the cassette in a store in a village nearby. Since then I've been watching it over and over again. The only remark I have is that, almost at the end, it suddenly stops raining from one moment at the other.

The film has a few sparks, but after a while it becomes predictable and silly with its no-suspense plot (it rides only on shock factor).

The genius innovation (or gimmick, rather) of this little monster is that the serial killer is making grim urban legends realities.
With a higher standard of characters and dialogue, the tiresomely predictable plot would forgivable. Unfortunately, Witt's wilting flower of a heroine gets no one's sympathy. Her awkward performance doesn't help. Aside from her, the rest of the cast barely have a character between them. The dialogue, meanwhile, is completely devoid of wit and overstuffed with cliches. It's all expectedly slick and clean, with some of the death scenes particularly well-executed, but the deadening lack of suspense renders them insignificant.As the final reel unravels, it's like watching a particularly brutal screwball comedy, the action is so farcical.

The problem with the movie is that there are too many jump scares(with music) that get tiring after about the third one.  After a great opening scene, the movie goes south a little.

So, when it came out on video I ran out and rented and I ended up buying it when it became available.  Sure, you can say, ""how could the killer be that person?  it's physically impossible!"", I agree, but the motive is totally realistic and plausible.  As for the actual killings?

It isn't slow moving, but yes, it does take some time to introduce some sort of middle section, fill in the plot a little, and add some character depth, instead of just skipping from death scene to death scene. It is similar to The Scream Series in that it is scary, centers mildly obnoxious teens, good deaths, good story, original and not just another Axe movie. So, if it does sort of resemble that, good job to the director for picking that movie to resemble!!!The movie is scary and starts of good with a very suspenseful scene!

It's a good idea and well-executed (I swear that no pun is intended) and Joshua Jackson, Alicia Witt and Rebecca Gayheart enjoy their roles.

One girl was working for a school radio program and another was an athlete on the swim team.  The people were diverse and well defined.  Also the movie's ability to shock you was amazing!  Just when the veiwer thinks one thing is going to happen something you didn't quite expect occurs instead.The actors and actresses in the film were mostly new comers with the major exception of horror movie veteran Robert Englund. It is refreshing to see so many new faces in the movie industry. Especialy ones who can act so well.  The fear and the insanity of the film are very much alive in the actors portrayal of the characters.  Especially in Rebecca Gayheart's performance.

I also fail to see how all other post Scream slashers are cashing in on the success of that movie.  The slasher movie has always been made, Scream was just clever enough to bring them back to the cinema.At the end of the day thay are all just slasher films about a crazed killer stalking and killing teenagers in a variety of fashions.Urban Legend goes for the 'killer on campus' area of the genre with a group of 'teens' falling prey to an unknown assassin and each getting murdered in highly imaginative ways (and I mean that)!Alicia Witt is the main star and although she is a good and very attractive actress, she is only minorly convincing.  She doesn't quite project her fear enough to get the viewer scared.  (Mariyln Burns was the last actress to achieve that with her relentless screaming in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - although Amy Steel came close in Friday 13th 2).There are a few impressive death scenes in Urban Legend, the hanging is particularly inventive and the opening scene is sure to make you gasp.Overall I enjoyed this movie, it is not trying to be clever and knows that it is just a run of the mill slasher flick.

From the insupportable Joshua Jackson with a horrible hair to Jared Letto (I've only see him acting well in G.I.). Only the leading roles were well. Rebecca Geyrheart  overacts, but her performance is the second best of the young cast. The best performance come from the sensible Alicia Witt, she has a wonderful talent and bright and paled face that the director know how to employ it successful.  Probably Witt is the best heroine of this late ninety trash movies. She is much better actress than Neve Campbell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

The acting was half decent, the cast led by Alicia Witt, well I just wanna know why she was even cast as the main character, I just thought she should've played someone else or should've been cast at all cause her acting was terrible, and Rebecca Gayheart, well her acting was half decent, but at least she can say that she has been in Scream 2 and Urban Legend, Jared Leto wasn't too bad in this film, his acting as the Journalist on campus was a okay role for him, Joshua Jackson was probably the best character in the film, he was funny, had bleach blonde hair, had the goaty goin, but his role in the movie just didn't satisfy anyone I believe.

238,steve187,"Worst of the worst from the ""rebirth"" of horror films (Some Spoilers)",2,1 June 2001,"Ok, I have to start by saying that I do love these teen slasher films. Even bad slasher films can be fun. But when you get a piece of fecal matter such as Urban Legend .... well, you have to draw the line somewhere!Let's start off with the characters. This film takes EVERY SINGLE stereotype about horror films and, rather than building on them or trying something new, simply recycles them. You have the pretty ""virginal"" girl (Think Jamie Lee in ""Halloween""), the weird girl who doesn't fit in (Think ""Valerie"" from ""Friday Pt 5"", the professor/older guy who gets killed (think Henry Winkler in ""Scream""), and OF COURSE the obligatory prankster whose death is thought of as a practical joke (remember the fat guy from ""Friday Pt. 3""? Oh, and the required creepy janitor guy, not to mention that all of the teens in this flick look like they stepped out of an Aaron Spelling TV show. Trite, trite, trite. Then of course you get the authority figures who are shown the truth but refuse to accept it, instead thinking that there's a ""rational explanation""... until there guts are hanging out or their heads are missing.But my favorite came in the scene with the death of one of the characters:S P O I L E R   A L E R T!   S P O I L E R   A L E R T !Ok, so you have the goth chick who is made to look like a suicide. Ok, so the dean says ""oh, it wasn't murder, it was suicide, and she wrote the message on the wall in her blood for you, Alicia Witt character"". Uh - huh. SO she slashes her wrist, goes to the wall, writes this message on the wall, and then dies -- WITHOUT LEAVING A BLOODY MESS ANYWHERE BUT ON THE BED! And if she wrote it on the wall (without losing conciousness), what did she use to write it with???? And the coup de gras: So it's maybe a murder, maybe a suicide --- and the campus police are the one's investigating?????
Man, makes me reeeeally glad that I went to a non - prestigous school, as these characters are just too dumb for their own good!Bottom line: just avoid this and rent a classic horror flick instead!",Urban Legend
239,jamesbuc,Falling apart at the seams,4,4 February 2007,"Okay plot! A group of high school/college/whatever kids are being stalked and killed one by one by a mysterious parka wearing killer. Seems simple enough? There are some nice touches along the way (such as the school's hide-up of a previous massacre) but not enough turns to keep things interesting.The cast are all pretty notable pulling off their respective parts well. Some nice character cameo's by Robert Englund and Brad Dorif make it a bit more worthwhile.Anyway lets just cut to the chase. This film is good, its interesting, the characters are built up well and with purpose and then the party scene arrives... The whole film then degenerates into a silly mess as intelligence, plot and purpose are all thrown out of the window.Take for example Tara Reid's character Sasha. Se is being chased by the killer (Noting that the killer has somehow teleported across campus). She goes down the stairs (killer doing some more magical teleporting) and could just run outside. What does she do? Run into the freaking elevator and go back up... Dipstick!Also past the party scene various ridiculous twists and stupid kills happen with the killer teleporting and various goofs happening.Anyway..

The acting in the movie is not too bad,even though I can't think of too many standout performances.Alicia Witt is OK in the lead,far from a Neve Campbell or a Jamie Lee Curtis.Jaret Leto is solid and I can understand how Rebecca Gayheart isn't the best, but I think she's hot so I'm biased.Joshua Jackson and Michael Rosenbaum annoyed the hell out me through this flick.They get what they deserve though.Loretta Devine would be a good Mrs. Jefferson if they ever make a movie.

Unfortunately, ""Urban Legend"" is just that.  Having heard urban legends since I was about 5 years old (and being a fan of horror movies), I went to see Urban Legend with eager anticipation.  I left the theater shaking my head in disappointment.  Instead of being treated to a fresh, scary and perhaps even mildly comedic take on the legends everyone has heard over the years (killer in the back seat, pop rocks and soda, etc.), the film is simply a typical and very unoriginal slasher flick.  There was not a surprise to be had in this movie.  All of the plot twists could be seen coming long before they happened.  In short, Urban Legend ends up being a poor rip off of the very successful Scream movies and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  If you want to see a well made  and very scary movie, go to the video store and pick up The Exorcist.",Urban Legend

Instead, I got a horrible excuse for a horror film. The whole cast sucks and none of the characters were believable. The only believable performance was Brad Dourif's very short cameo in the beginning. He really put fear into the beginning which was the only good part in the whole film. Dourif's part is the only reason you should go see this so-called horror film.",Urban Legend
252,mviebuff,"After this thriller, you will have to check the back seat!",9,7 March 1999,"If you consider a horror film a movie starring a young popular T.V. star (a.k.a. Neve Campbell), a soon-to-be-well-known script writer (a.k.a. Kevin Williamson), and a famous horror director (a.k.a. Wes Craven) than you might not call Urban Legend your typical horror film. Unlike the past Scream and I Know... movies, Urban Legend has its own, unique way of scaring you. Instead of ghostface popping out from behind a hidden door or the fisherman breaking through shower glass, the killer in Urban Legend doesn't just jump out and attack his victims, he makes them legends. He tends to put you in suspense almost making the movie come alive and feeling like reality. Just like the tagline says, ""just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't"".The director chose well known legends almost everyone has heard of, such as the psycho in the backseat or the threatening phone calls to the babysitter which are coming from the children's bedroom. Since we know these stories so well it makes us feel like we are there and that we are the next victim. Even if you don't care for a character you almost feel sorry for them knowing exactly how they're going to die. The opening scene in the movie with Natasha Wagner in her car is by far the most suspenseful and scary part of the film. As you see the killer rise behind her, your heart starts pounding and you are hoping she turns around in time before he swings his axe. After this scene the legends are not as scary or threatening, but an action scene in which Tara Reid is pursued is rather gripping.As well as action, the film also has some funny and quite clever lines driven by Tara Reid's character Sasha while speaking over the radio with some freshman. This film was surprisingly scary and shockingly entertaining and I recommend it to all horror fans, but if you are a dog lover I strongly suggest to not see this film!",Urban Legend
253,Jorgen-8,the ultimate proof why one should leave horror movies to Williamson,3,19 August 1999,"This movie is just about the perfect example on how horror movies should not be made. It loses the grip on the audience during the very first minutes, and it does not manage to regain that grip during the rest of the movie.The problems are these:a) the plot is not interesting enough. Now, even if the basic idea of a serial killer with an 'urban legends-theme' causes    some mild suspense, the screenplay destroys it fully.b) the plot has several logical 'holes' that leaves a lot of loose ends; especially during the last 15 minutes.c) the actors are mediocre (in their best moments). The murderer is not convincingly played, and there really are no role characters worth noticing (or that are even remotely  interesting).Altogether this is just a bad spinoff of the Scream movies, and I suggest you go see Scream I instead.

I loved Tara Reid's character and her hilarious talk show callers. What I really hate is people comparing this movie to scream. Does this movie feature references to other movies? No. Does this movie have the killer killing people in the same boring way over and over? No. And finally, does this movie feel like a 90's teen horror movie. NO! The death scenes make it feel like it's a movie from the 80's. There are some great scenes in here like: SPOILER! SPOILER! Sasha's death scene, the pop rocks scene, and it had the great killer in the backseat opening murder. END OF SPOILER. People think that just because it came out after Scream it's a copycat. Well Friday the 13th came out after Halloween and that was considered a copycat. But what about all of the horror movies that came out in the early 70's before Halloween. There were slashers. And all of the movies in the late 80's weren't considered copycats. So in the end this movie is better than Scream but not as good as Scream 2. It should at least be considered a rental for some people. URBAN LEGEND gets 11/10 for having original death scenes, a great cast, and some good funny dialogue.",Urban Legend
255,d87crawford,Teen slasher at it's best,9,10 October 2004,A funny/scary slasher film where a manic wrecks havoc on a quiet university by killing many of the students using Urban Legends. The plot is original and inventive however it is unrealistic as almost everything falls into the killer's hands and totally works out perfectly.The cast are all young gorgeous 20 somethings who have moderate talent. Tara Reid and Rebecca Gayheart stand way above the rest and steal all the scenes they are in. Alicia Witt displays some talent but not quite matching the efforts of the other girls. The guys are equally as gorgeous but less talented. The film also has many treat cameos for die hard horror fans like Brad Dourif (Chucky) and Robert Englund (Freddy Kruger).SPOILERS The end however is laughable when it turns out that Gayheart is the killer is just ridiculous the the fact that we are supposed to believe that a young girl could possibly;y have the strength to kill lots of fit young guys is just stupid.

Okay, so as I was watching the movie I was thinking, ""I've seen Scream 1 and 2 and I Know What You Did.  I'm pretty sick of those but I'll sit through this anyways.""  The movie totally lacked a good story.  The writer obviously didn't research beforehand on the attitudes of college students because he/she was way off.  Plus I can't stand in movies how they make all the characters really gorgeous.  It's just not realistic.But I'm going to have to watch what I say because I can't expect this genre to be realistic anyhow!

The actors/actresses played their parts very well.Though Urban Legends is a thriller, a little comedy was thrown into it.

Also amusing is Reese's Peanut Butter Cop, who prances around with her gun while watching blaxploitation flicks.The movie does a great job of demonstrating how curly-haired people don't think straight! You might think it's highly illogical to plan and execute an elaborate string of urban-legend based murders to avenge the inadvertent death of your boyfriend years earlier. Instead of simply killing the girls ""responsible"" in a more direct manner, she chooses methods worthy of a cheesy Batman TV series villain. It also doesn't make sense that she kills Michelle ( the more culpable of the 2 ) first, then a bunch of insignificant characters, saving Natalie for last. But, understand that Brenda has curly hair. Scientific studies have proved that the brains of the curly-haired expend so much energy on curling hair, that they just don't think as good as normal folks.You get a good sense of Brenda's oppression when Jared Leto rejects her advances, choosing the straight-haired Natalie instead.",Urban Legend

261,chainsaw-8,Good premise wasted in tepid horror film,5,29 September 1998,"The days of low-budget slasher films appear to be back with Urban Legend, a mildly entertaining but mostly lame variation on Scream with an attractive cast of young TV stars.The plot centers on a series of campus murders in the mold of urban legends, most of which will be familiar even to the younger audience this is pandering to. What little suspense there is comes from the anticipation of these scenes, since the surrounding story is almost as ridiculous as the film itself.If the screenwriters had concentrated less on incorporating the whodunit aspect into the plot and more on the legends themselves, they might have had something here. Experienced viewers will spot the killer's identity (and motive) early on, and those that don't will be fooled only because the conclusion is so completely ludicrous, not to mention mostly impossible.Of course, most of this would be easily overlooked if Urban Legend was scary, but time and again, director Jamie Banks telegraphs the surprises far ahead, and doesn't know how to time the shocks.  Over and over we get the sudden burst of loud music followed by a character running into another character, but it doesn't work. And that gets annoying after the third or fourth try. Occasionally Banks does get something eerie going, but the style is more suited to an action flick.Of the cast, most of the actors more or less get by despite a less-than-clever script, though it's disheartening to see a talented young actor like Jared Leto wasting his time with a nothing role as the reporter. Horror favorites Robert Englund and Brad Douriff pop up in cameos, adding a nice touch to their brief scenes.What we're left with is an intriguing idea undone by cliche after cliche. The legends are potent enough to hold your attention to the end, and horror fans will find a few gruesome goodies to amuse themselves. And even though the script needs to be about three times again as clever as it is, there is a great in-joke at the end about one of the actresses and a commercial.That clever scene might have been the first scene of a clever movie.  It's the last scene of this one.",Urban Legend

263,Gar-6,This was an utterly awful twist on a recent rash of slashers.,1,26 October 1998,"Urban Legend was a total failure on an otherwise good idea. This was a rare movie where I was tempted to leave the theatre near the end. The movie lured people in with an original plot and a promising TV cast, but managed to humiliate the young actors. The movie was improved only slightly by Alicia Witt and the comedic performance of the janitor. Rebecca Gayheart, who should stick to facial cream commercials suggested she doesn't speak, provided an embarrassing performance. The movie stuck to a mediocre level as the film progressed and left an essence of hope to the audience with clues that it could possibly improve, but no. As soon as the climax hinted its start you began to wonder how this production could get worse, that being your only incentive to stay.The writers stood with the classic slasher rules, to the best of their knowledge. Making the killer whom you'd least suspect became a bit of a novelty. I can just imagine: ""let's see who've  made the least obvious through bad clues . . ."" I'd be more satisfied with the killer being someone we've never even seen before, like a guest celebrity, or Red Herring.",Urban Legend
264,Manuel-18,And the resurgence continues downward...,1,17 June 1999,"If it were up to me,  I'd eliminate Scream from existence.Why?Because it spawned trash like Urban Legend.I am most definitely not the biggest Scream fan.  I wasn't fond of the film at all.  But it made a respectable attempt to poke fun at one of the most moribund genres in movie history:  the slasher film.  Therefore, I had no beef with it.Of course, then came the clones.  And the second smearing of horror's name in the last two decades.  Whiles the eighties had such classics as the original Nightmare on Elm Street and Hellraiser, most eighties horror consisted of explicit gore and dead teenagers.  Nothing scary.The early to mid-nineties started off well for horror, I thought.  We had intelligent horror films like Candyman and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Well-written horror that was actually scary.  Then came Scream.  And all that changed.Scream ushered in a brand of horror that was self-referential, utilizing humor and gore over suspense and scares.  Every horror movie since has followed the same formula.  There's no such thing as originality anymore. Gone are the days of creative horror movies, such as the Phantasm and Evil Dead series.  In are schlock films such as Urban Legends, wherein teenagers walk around darkly lit rooms and bump into each other, screaming and spouting ridiculous dialogue until they're bumped off by the mad slasher. Films that, as I said, place gore and humor above scares.Is it so wrong to want to be scared by a horror film?  Is it so wrong to want to have the same feeling I got when I saw the original Halloween, taking in the creepy atmosphere, the suspense?  Is it so wrong to want to see a horror film that keeps me at the edge of my seat, instead of making me laugh at its complete ineptitude and self-referential story (or lack thereof)?  Am I not ""with it""?It seems so.  True horror fans are being given the shaft, so that fans of poorly-acted, unoriginal slasher flicks full of the popular teenage actors of the day can be appeased and exploited, in an attempt to bring in the almighty dollar.

272,Moulaka,typical but fun scary movie,7,27 September 1998,"I love horror movies.  When I go to the theaters to see one, I am not expecting a revolutionary, groundbreaking film experience.  This is definitely one that brings nothing new to the life of the horror movie than an interesting premise.  I have read Ebert's review of the movie and discovered that I strongly agree with him on the movie's sole reliance on the clang effect for making the audience jump.  It's where the camera is close up on the character's faces and the viewer knows something is going to happen,  tension rises, and then...CLANG.  Everyone jumps and maybe the killer is there or maybe he isn't.  After an hour of clangs I stopped jumping.  Still, the ride is fun.  The movie is interesting until the end. I was a little disappointed in the way the ending evolved and concluded. But what can you do?  Most horror movies end badly, but this one has your stereotypical somebody's-gone-over-the-deep-end individual who needs to exact revenge.  Audience members have seen this ploy repeated way too often ever since Jason's mother appeared on the screen.  Either way I recommend this movie for  at least being an above average horror movie.  And when you leave the theater at night, be sure to check the back seat. Ciao.",Urban Legend
273,DaveyQ,Kevin Williamson did not invent this Genre!!!,8,11 October 1998,"The whole, this is a rip off of ""Scream"" and Kevin Williamson is getting really old! Urban Legend does not rip off either of those two things. Kevin Williamson did not invent the slasher genre. And this guy is getting much more praise then he should. If one reads the original script for Scream, one would see nothing but another early eighties horror flick. Yawn. ""Scream"" was a success because of talented actors (most of the lines were improvised... not written by Kevin), and a great director. What Urban Legend is is a great entertaining thrill ride. Who cares what some people are saying about this one... those same people are the ones who only saw ""Scream"" because their horror loving friends talked them into it and only saw this one wanting to compare it to ""Scream"" anyway. Thus, their comments are worthless. The slasher sub-genre isn't for ""English Patient"" loving buffoons... so ignore what the critics say. Make your own judgement... as far as I can tell... it seems to be a 50/50 split between who loved/liked it and who hated/was disappointed by it.",Urban Legend
274,DaveyQ,Much better then you are hearing!!!,8,11 October 1998,"I've read a lot of negative things about this title, I don't agree with any of them. It is being called a ""rip-off"" of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer... it is most assuredly not!! In fact, with the exception of some hokey acting, this film does rank right up there with the two previously mentioned films. But then again, Neve Campbell of Scream is hardly an Oscar winner. Anyway, the film concerns a group of colege students... by the by this new resurge of slasher films works much better then those of the early eighties- which cast late 20s early 30sactors as teenagers, in favor of casting teenagers as teenagers! Urban Legends is hip, entertaining, fun and scary. Two death sequences are unmatched and will prove to be that which to top for the slasher films to come. The murderer kills in accordance to those much beloved Urban Legends we've all heard before, but with gruesome new intensity. It is well directed, competently written and acted and just a great genre film. Don't ignore just because of what some English Patient loving moron film critic says... Urban Legends is one to Check out!!!!",Urban Legend
275,padre-2,A couple screams and a few laughs.,5,26 September 1998,Urban Legend is an okay film if you come in with low expectations.  It is basically a knock-off (like so many others) of Scream.  The writers did do a pretty good job of keeping you guessing till the very end about the identity of the killer.  Some of the few highlights are humourous references to the actors' other projects.  How many did you catch?,Urban Legend
276,Niemh,"So much potential, so little acting...",4,7 May 1999,"I find it a shame that a movie with a premise like this wasn't carried as far as it could go.  Perhaps the vision wasn't there, or the ideas that could make this movie a classic, but with this much potential, it's really too bad they only went 50% with the fear, thrillers, plot twists, etc. Poor acting, slow & predictable story, and did they really need to nuke the dog? Possibly the best part was the gas station attendant in the beginning.",Urban Legend
277,Lemonade16,Good entertainment,8,11 June 2001,"So maybe this movie is just cashing in on the success of Scream and the following slasher movies, but I enjoyed this movie a lot.  The opening scene still freaks me out, and there's plenty of gore (perhaps a little too much) and good uses of popular urban legends.  **SPOILER**It covers everything from the man in the back seat, high beam initiation, and the kidney heist and even more that I hadn't heard of.  **END SPOILER** Although the final scenes were a little unbelievable, the killer had good motives to support the killings.  There are plenty of jump moments, although most of the time it's just a friend, not the killer.  All in all, it's not an Oscar contender, but it's plenty of fun.  Much better than the sequel, and pretty high up there with some of the other slasher movies, like Scream, Final Destination, and I Know What You Did Last Summer.
I give this movie a 7/10.",Urban Legend

I found myself completely blown away by the identity of the killer, I never, ever saw it coming. Well I won't say more for the people who haven't seen it. This movie for some reason got terrible reviews and I don't know why, The previews did make this look like an I know what you did last summer rip off, but man this movie blows that movie to shambles.This movie also has some really hot women, in Rebecca Gayheart (nothing to loose) and that red head chick whose name I can't remember. Let me say this, you just won't see the ending coming at all. it's just the exact way you execute a slasher mystery.10/10, one of my favorite ultimate slasher movies.

This movie is no way a ""waste of time"". I often read that this film is a scream rip-off. Maybe in some basic ideas, but aren't all these teenager-college student-slasher movies based on similar ideas? Compared to i know what you did... and scream 1+2 i thought the storyline was original and the actors were really cool. And I couldn't predict the end of the movie as i could in scream 1+2 & IKWYDLS after the first 10min. So everyone who wants to have fun in a movie of this genre, i would say: GO SEE IT!!!!!",Urban Legend
280,indigo-2,A Mediocre Rip off of Scream & I Know What You Did Last Summer,1,17 August 1998,"It is a sad state of affairs when a film has to rip off not just one mediocre horror film, but two. Urban Legend does just that, taking a brilliant premise, casting a group of untalented 20-somethings, giving them hip one-liners and bland dialogue, thereby creating a carbon copy of last year's I Know What You Did Last Summer and 1996's Scream. What could have been fresh and exciting just comes off as another glib horror movie that startles you, but never really scares. The killer goes around dressed as Nanook of the North, killing college coeds with apparent ease and strength. When the killer is finally revealed, the filmmakers expect us to believe that this person can, among other things, hang a larger person by a rope and throw another victim across the room.
The cast is just another bunch of television has-beens and soon-to-be-has -beens. Alicia Witt can't scream to save her life (no pun intended) and Rebecca Gayheart can't act to save her fledgling career. If you want real horror, rent Hellraiser. If you want a great take on an urban legend (the baby sitter and the man upstairs), rent Halloween. But don't waste your hard earned money on Urban Legend.",Urban Legend

Are we to believe a 98 lb. woman threw around 180 lb. men as she slashed them? Rebecca Gayheart is great eye candy but can't act to save her life. There is the standard ""two scares to every kill"" and so many idiotic things going on it was hard to stay the whole movie. ( Ex:  Why was the girl at the poolside wearing a parka in warm weather?) Unfortunately, there were enough 13 year olds in attendance that this movie will make $60 million and we'll have the sequel ""Legend Has It You Screamed Last Summer"".",Urban Legend
283,Mr.Zebra,"I would have given it a ""2,"" but Alicia Witt is gorgeous.",5,14 January 1999,"Is anyone familiar with this (sub)urban legend?  A menagerie of mooncalves herds into a movie theater, pays eight dollars a muzzle to see a poorly-reviewed film, and then spends an interminable length of time yawning and staring morosely at radium-illuminated watch dials.  A few months later, each of those intrepid filmgoers develops cancer from excessive short-term radiation exposure.  So have you heard about that myth?  Just curious. (Cough, cough.  Damned chemo.)",Urban Legend
284,dv8-2,ultra cool no-brainer,7,28 September 1998,"Just to preface this,I am biased toward this new wave of neo-brat pack slasher flicks.  This premise is much more intriguing than Scream but the story behind it could have been better.  The writers did a good job stuffing as many legends in as they could.  I could see how some killings could look random if you aren't well versed in some of the lesser known legends.  The scenery is well scripted and the cast does an excellent job with the story they have to work with.  Two good things about the film: I didn't have a good idea who the bad guy was until it was revealed, maybe I'm dumb, secondly the movie was entertaining enough for me to not realize what was wrong with the story until after I left the theater.

285,Filmdude-2,Good Escapist Entertainment,8,6 October 1998,"You have to have a certain mindset when going to see a slasher film be it from the 80's or 90's.  You can't be expecting high-art or even an entirely believable execution.  ""Scream"" was one of those slasher films that surprised everyone because it was far better than what most people were expecting. ""Urban Legend"" was the latest slasher film to surprise me.  I went into the film with very low expectations and came out of the theatre thoroughly entertained.  The movie was never boring, unlike the majority of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and the middle of Scream 2.  The movie followed the simple rule of maintaining a consistently high body count in order to keep boredom from setting in.  I believe their was at least one death every 10-15 minutes.  The deaths were creative and twisted, the characters were amusing, and the guessing game was fun.  The killer was unbelievable, but was at least more interesting than the killers in ""IKWYDLS"" or ""Scream 2"". If you like slasher films you'll enjoy ""Urban Legend"".  Just go with some friends, bet on who the killer is about 1/4 way through and enjoy the slayings.",Urban Legend
286,Filmdude-2,Surprisingly Entertaining!,8,13 January 1999,"I'd heard comments beforehand about this movie being the worst slasher of 1998.  I'd have to disagree vehemently.  ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" easily takes that crown and I'd rank it right behind ""Scream 2"" as the best of post-Scream slashers.  ""Urban Legends"" was definitely in the vein of post-Scream slasher films aimed at a teenage audience with pop culture references, but this movie had something other SCREAM clones didn't have...  Original and inventive death scenes and some truly suspenseful moments.  The opening scene of ""Urban Legend"" was excellent.  Easily the best opening since ""SCREAM"" and ""SCREAM 2"".  The actors were competent and their characters were developed as much as they needed to be in a slasher movie.  If you go into ""Urban Legends"" expecting a well thought out and scary horror film you will be thoroughly disappointed.  If you want to see some inventive death scenes and campy humor you will enjoy this movie. WARNING:  (SPOILER SPACE)***********SPOILER SPACE********* The Ending of this movie is LUDICROUS... funny as hell.... but pretty much just plain STUPID.  I enjoyed the hell out of it, partly because I won a bet with my friend as to who the killer was 15 minutes into the movie, but nonetheless the ending probably ruined this movie for serious audiences. I'd heard about a ludicrious ending before I saw it, but I was delighted to see how over the top the killer was at the end.  Just enjoy this little slasher film...

I thought it was excellent and have loved the horror genre ever since. Urban Legand was made to be nominated for any major awards. No horror movie is ever made for that purpose. Movies are supposes to entertain. Also, I hate these reviews from people that call any horror movie coming out a ""Scream""-rip off. The only way this movies is related to Scream is that it features good-looking people being killed by a serial killer. By that logic, Fallen is a Scream rip-off. No movie trivia. No phone terror.

289,Dawson-9,disappointment!,3,2 January 1999,"Classic Urban legends were always my favourite for many reasons- they were short, simple, scary, and real. When I heard about the movie URBAN LEGEND I was scared that the stories, were not going to live up to their true nature, on film. Well, after the excellent opening scene, my worst nightmare had come true. URBAN LEGEND was a disorganized, unappealing, and not-at-all scary, bad movie. The major flaw in Urban Legend, is that it ventures far from the reality that the original stories had created in their own way. For example; what was the killer thinking, wearing a heavy parka in a very warm environment? Especially in a heated swimming pool arena. Or what about the improbability that a person can fall many floors from a window, land on solid ground, but still manage to get back up and go for the kill again? Also, what made the stories scary, was very simple. The actual danger was not realized until after the fact. It was at that point when the characters realize how close they were to the danger. In URBAN LEGEND it is too late for the characters to even realize that they are in danger, before they are killed off! The acting was uneven, the storyline was another SCREAM copycat, and the murders were nothing to really remember. The legends about this film are true- it's  horrible!!!",Urban Legend

295,co0ovy,All your favorite legends combined into one film,10,18 March 2001,"Urban Legend begins with a typical and often told legend that somehow relates to your neighbor's sister's boyfriend's friend, and a death is presumably expected within the first scene, due to the fact that, well, this is a horror movie. It's the legend about the young, naive woman with the unnoticed murderer lurking in the backseat of the car, but you've all heard that one. . .The cast contains all of the well-respected (by teens, of course) stars, few which are the product of popular TV shows centering around the lives of dazed and confused adolescents. ""Dawson Creek's"" Joshua Jackson is an ignorant and often innappropriate character, unlike his character in the show. His wittiness contributes to the overall comedic value of the film. However, his rude comments are made after another college student has been axed, and it's incredibly unrealistic that a person could be insensitive to that level, but his adorableness distracts viewers from the appalling qualities of his jokes.This film will appeal to all move-goers who have been dealt their share of urban legends. It contains the ""dog in the microwave legend"", which proves quite disgusting, and probably the most common--- the bloody Mary legend. This does make several scenes in the movie quite predictable, but nonetheless, excitement and familiarity adds to the viewer's enjoyment. The ""stolen kidney"" legend is also featured, as well as the ridiculous rumor that pop rocks will cause explosion in your stomach when mixed with Coca-Cola.The conclusion isn't too predictable--it's almost surprising after your suspicions are laid on another mysterious character. It truly makes you wonder who to trust. . .Somehow, the movie manages to like all these legends together in an uncomplicated plot which contains stereotypical drunken college students who ignore all warnings from adults and ""just have fun."" The students are forewarned multiple times of an event that occurred years before and left no survivors. Of course, they are cautioned on the anniversary of the deaths, fearing that it may occur again.I have seen this movie three or four times, and it doesn't become tiresome. The overall theme of urban legends is clever, and the movie is well-done.",Urban Legend

This movie should probably be somehow horrific but I would put it in the same category as for example Scary Movie.First of all, the murderer is absolutely not human, since she always knows where the victims go, and on top of all that, her timing is also perfect. In the middle of the movie it starts bothering since she's always waiting in the bushes or waiting in the garage or whatever. Of course it's possible that she followed the victims all the time, but It's a wonder if they didn't notice anyone following them. In the end, when the cop shoots the murderer in the chest making her fall out of the window from the second floor, she remains alive, and without any bigger trouble she goes hiding on the backseat of the car. But when she falls from a bridge to the water, she suddenly dies (?). I'd call it pretty unrealistic.Second of all, how is it possible that so many characters are wearing/own the same coat as the murderer. Of course it brings along the excitement but still, in my opinion, is very poor. And when the massacre was mentioned, what does it got to do with the professor being let to keep his job if he shuts his mouth? Maybe It's just me being stupid but I don't think the idea was brought up very clearly.The last clitch would be the whole plot. I don't know if it was the same girl who killed all the people on the campus, but before she even knew that Natalie (or whatever her name was) was responsible for the death of her ex-boyfriend, she had already killed 3 or more people. So, was she doing it just for fun or what's the real deal? Obviously, as you can see, I didn't like the movie very much. The directing, special effects etc. were above average but the story itself was a fiasco. Yet, if you want to spend an hour and 30 minutes of your life on something useless, this is exactly what you're looking for.(I apologize for the bad English)",Urban Legend

The multiple plot twists is what gives this hair raising thriller it's good notoriety. Many others believe that this movie falls into the ""Too Cliché"" category. I disagree with this statement. The way the Killer's identity juggles from character to character is what keeps the watcher on their toes, metaphorically speaking. The way that the writers pack so many Urban Legends into one intricate web of hair raising madness. My only problem with this movie is the title, not that it's not a great title, it's just that it's gained me a large mass of notoriety. My name is Urban, and every time I meet someone they always associate me with the Title. Back to the topic, the choice of characters for this movie is positively staggering. Brad Dourif (Child's Play) as the gas station attendant, Robert Englund (Nightmare on Elm Street) as the suspected murderer, Joshua Jackson (Dawsons Creek) as the corky horny teenager, Tara Reid(American Pie) as the sexy radio host, and ""The"" lovely Rebecca Gayheart(Dead Like Me) as the raging serial Urban Legend murderer. Miss Gayheart's beauty can only be surpasses by her madness in this new-aged ""Urban"" slasher flick. I highly suggest seeing this climactic theatrical masterpiece.

These slasher movies in the late 90s were able to attract decent casts due to the higher budgets and trendiness, and then go absolutely brutal with how they decide to treat their characters. How else can you explain Robert Englund and Brad Dourif showing up for a few minutes each just to throw you off the scent? How about Danielle Harris appearing as a minor goth character, unceremoniously strangled to death 40 minutes in. How about Joshua Jackson, bleaching his hair and being strung up by his neck above a car by a rope? Or even Tara Reid, limited to play the big-breasted blonde who is chopped up with an axe live on the radio.

303,joneill4,"Heard the one about the boring, cheesy 'Scream' knock-off???",3,26 February 1999,"Like many other people who have seen 'Urban Legend', my biggest complaint is that it wasted an outstanding idea, thus preventing a *talented* director from making a decent flick. Had this film succeeded in developing the 'Urban Legend Serial Killer' concept, people would have been looking for psychos underneath their cars after leaving the theaters -- instead, they were laughing at how ridiculous this movie was.The most frustrating aspect of this movie was the incessant use of seemingly every horror cliche in the book (Well, not all of them. A Tara Reid shower scene might have at least made the movie interesting for a few minutes). I mean, the main character actually said, ""You know you'll never get away with this!"" The only thing worse than this cheesy dialogue is the cheesier dialogue recited by the actual killer in the final scene, which by the way is the worst ending to a film I've seen in years (If you have the patience to watch the movie all the way through, however, be sure to compare the dialogue, setting, and resolution to a recent Simpsons 'Treehouse of Horrors' episode.  Now you'll now where third-rate screenwriters get their ideas from.)There were some decent moments in the film, however, including a relatively exciting opening scene. Unfortunately, the highlights of the movie are the little inside jokes the director slips in. Had he spent as much time on on the rest of the plot as these in-jokes, I would have really enjoyed this film.The ending of this film will leave the viewer asking many questions.  For example:  Why does the legend that surrounds this fictional university (and takes up a good 1/3 of the dialogue) have nothing to do with the plot? Why is the same 'eerie' chord played whenever anyone bumps into another character?  And why does everyone have the same stupid coat?!? These questions are never answered, and neither is the most important question of all -- why would anyone pay $7 to see this movie, when a 99 cent rental of a '70s horror flick with a $500 budget would be just as thrilling?One final note. There is a particularly gruesome scene involving a dog in the film. Therefore I would recommend that members of PETA stay away from this movie. For everyone else, I recommend that you join PETA so that you too can stay away from this movie.",Urban Legend

305,colin-13,"A pale, derivative Scream wannabe",3,2 October 1998,"The movie Scream was a hip, humorous homage to the slasher films of the 80's. It's originality came from the fact that it winked at itself, it's predecessors and the audience. Urban Legends also tries to pay homage -- to Scream.  It's got the same elements: A young, good-looking heroine; an intrepid reporter; some wry allusions to popular culture; a serial killer who seems to know his victims' every thought before they do. But instead of doing something original with these elements, the film instead feeds us stale cliches, like a creepy janitor who startles people when they turn around (with aid from the film-maker in the form of sudden music and white flashes).The story begins with a promising, suspenseful murder. But once the action moves to Pendleton University, it collapses under its own weight.  An hour of suffering through the contrived, patchwork scenes full of stilted dialogue convinced me that the writer was making it up as he went along, and moreover, that he'd never been to an American college.  This is a school with one security guard, one dean, one professor, one student reporter and a huge building whose sole purpose seems to be to provide a good place for a murder.Instead of ending after the obligatory climactic party scene, the film runs from set to set for another half an hour, piling up murders and red herrings.

Of course, ""Spaceballs"", one of my personal favs, didn't exactly fit the fit the price of a good theatre seat, but was pretty good for a dollar rental. ""Urban Legend"" is the movie to break the streak.        The movie is a standard ""who done it?"", hack and slash movie with the underlying story taken from ""Scream"", the plot a takeoff of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and the plot twists resembling ""Wild Things"". While I tried to take my eyes off the Claire Danes look-a-like on screen, I attempted to figure out who the killer was.  The only reason I couldn't figure it out had to do with the revealing material the ""Sydney Prescott"" wanna be was wearing. A brief appearance was made by Robert Englund, or Freddy Kruger as we know him better as.  Also Danielle Harris, the hot chick who played Molly, a girl that lived next door from Darlene on the TV show ""Rosanne"", has a minor roll as a poser, err goth.  Lastly Joshua Jackson from ""Dawson's Creek"" makes a brief appearance accomplishing nothing. The only good thing about this movie is the ending, which made me vote it a ""9"".  For those of you looking for a good movie with all the right moves then this is it.  Since Titanic, no movie that has targeted the teenage audience been so good.  Leonardo, eat your heart out.  Wait...I think I remember a story once about a guy....",Urban Legend
310,Rhonda-4,This movie was so smooth!!,8,29 September 1998,I thought that this movie was so smooth! It took me a while to figure out who it was and even then I couldn't think of a reason! It kept me on the edge of my seat! I screamed and jumped the whole way through!! Really good movie!,Urban Legend
311,Choff,"GREAT IDEA, BUT....",5,2 October 1998,"Ever been to a movie that was ""not bad"" but could have easily been ""great""? Well, you know exactly how I felt walking out of Urban Legend.  It was easy to see that the movie was going for a SCREAM quality, but unfortunately comes up short (mostly due to the writing, I believe).  The premise of an Urban Legend serial killer is super (I mean, who out there doesn't believe that eating Pop-Rocks and drinking Soda is a very bad idea), because everyone knows so many of these ""legends"".  It's very easy to become involved in a movie that plays upon popular beliefs, because the viewers all have a common framework to reference.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't deliver much more than a few mediocre screams.  I'd have given it a lower score if Robert Englund wasn't in the film.  The film earns at least a one point bonus for having ""Freddy"" in the cast...",Urban Legend
312,nima-2,"A predictable, though moderately enjoyable, rip off of Scream - except not as good.",6,3 October 1998,"I went to go see this movie on opening night, excited for what I thought would be a horror movie of ""Scream"" proportions. After all, the plot of a killer utilizing urban legends to off his victims is brilliant. I left the theatre pleased with the movie I'd seen, but disappointed at how much better it could have been. This is definately one of those movies that seems worse and worse the more you think about it.The main problem with this movie is it tries so hard to be ""Scream"" that the story becomes tedious. The movie revolves almost solely around Alicia Witt's character, making her akin to Neve Campbell's ""Sidney"". The problem here is that the deaths occuring in the movie are much closer related to Alicia's character. You can't help but stop and ask, ""If all your friends are dying off why are you staying in this freaky college?"" Alicia's character degenerates to being a paranoid, whinny, annoying presence.Another problem from having the movie revolve around Alicia Witt is that the other characters in the movie are way overshadowed. You never get the sense of who the other characters are. In ""Scream"", you got to know Randy's (Jamie Kennedy) character very well. The same goes for ""I know what you did last summer"".Finally, the movie is extremely predictable. I saw it with two of my friends and we each had the killer pinned half way through the movie. Its also very obvious who's going to die, making the only interesting part how they're going to die. Contrary to the movie's title, not all the deaths appear to be based on urban legends, and most of the ones that are turn out very lame. There is only one really good urban legend killing, and that's the very first one you see (which is probably the best part of the movie). The ending of the movie is also predictable, but is disturbingly appropriate nonetheless.All in all, this is ""Scream"", except the killer isn't as interesting to look at, the deaths aren't as interesting, there's no mystery, its bloodier, there are more cheap scares, the characters are lamer, and the ending isn't as gratifying. On a horror movie scale of 1-10 (10 being ""Scream"", 8 being ""I know..."", and ""Jason goes to hell"" as 1) ""Urban Legend"" is probably a 6. If you're going to see this movie, try to get a discounted ticket.",Urban Legend
313,cl-3,Great film with a great ending.,9,15 October 1998,"Urban Legend was a great film.  I had no idea about the end.  It kept me guessing, who the murderer was right until the end.  I'm glad it left it wide open for a sequel.  Throughout the movie I made the following assumptions: the murders were all going to be a hoax for the class to get an ""A"" in Urban Legends, or a fraternity initiation prank, or Paul(Jared Leto) tyring to beef up his writing career.  I won't say whether I was right or not for those of you who haven't seen it yet.  That's the greatest element of a good horror/suspense movie--It keeps you guessing!  So if you liked Scream go see it!!  In my opiniion it's better.",Urban Legend
314,grittyktty,"Wow, I saw it all coming.",1,24 May 1999,"I could predict everything.  The only thing I didn't see coming was the killer...  Anyway, moving on... I rented this movie not expecting to see anything great, and with that in mind, the movie sure delivered everything I expected.  Boring, slow, predictable..  This is a typical horror movie directed at people under the age of 18 who watch Dawson's Creek and other various teenage television shows.  It follows the typical format of the horror movie: a cast of about eight young, recognizable, attractive movie stars.  There's the smart, strong one, the innocent friend, and the suspect.  The other five people are merely filling.  The movie follows the typical path of stupidity and sex--how else are they going to get the viewers to stay and watch? Avoid this stinker at all costs.",Urban Legend
315,Matt-133,Very Cool,10,4 December 1998,"Urban Legend was a very well done film...After Scream came out it would be very hard to keep a suspense feeling up, trying to make it as different of a movie yet keeping it on a guessing scale",Urban Legend

317,meg37,anyone with half a brain can predict this movie,2,6 January 1999,"If you have seen any of the other late nineties, teen horror flicks, you have seen ""Urban Legend"".  And if, in addition, you have read any urban legends in your lifetime, you can predict the end of this film halfway through, along with the murderer and motive.  However, if you like attractive young actors screaming and cracking a couple pop culture references and want to leave your WB and go rent a movie, I suppose ""Urban Legend"" is a good bet for you.",Urban Legend
318,Stokely-4,It wasn't that bad.,10,25 January 1999,"Ok, the killer may have been cheesy, but the movie was still a ride. The opening sequence was great although another, maybe a more well-known actress would've got more sympathy from the audience. Natalie's character was a whiner also. Now the real gems were Danielle Harris as the kick-ass goth Tosh and Tara Reid as the steamy Sasha. The Death scenes were creepy. I mean the boyfriend hanging from the tree was scary, as was the girl killed while her roommate slept. Also, everyone's wondering about the radio chick's death and how it's not an Urban Legend. But there is a story about a girl who was raped and killed during a campus coed scream session and everyone thought she was part of it. I recommend it.",Urban Legend
319,sarge-22,"Good in parts, but at the end of the day, just another Scream rip-off.",7,15 March 1999,"I would agree with a lot of previous reviews in saying that the death scenes in this film were very original, especially the one with the guy hanging from the tree where he got killed because Alicia Witt un'witt'ingly drove the car that she was in to get away from the killer, not knowing that the rope the guy was hanging on by the neck was attached to the car.However, I feel that the film didn't take enough breaks in between each kill. There was absolutely no hint of mystery whatsoever. None of the characters made any interesting theories about who the killer could've been (like Randy from Scream; by the way, Damon was a crap Randy) apart from Paul and what's her name accusing a certain character of being the killer when they find a piece of ""too hard"" evidence pointing towards him. Aren't these mysteries much better when you are following a main character who is trying to solve the case at a 'professional' level? e.g. Se7en (a serious film).These ""Guesswhodunnits"" are getting a little bit boring now. 'I know what you did.....' was OK but this is too ordinary. Just another Scream rip-off to me. I thought Scream was superior to UL because it was much more clever. Also, it actually had a killer that ran (what what what?) so it looked more realistic, not like the maniac in the parka jacket in UL that walked at snails pace and still managed to catch and kill his/her victims. Halloween and IKWYDLS are also guilty of this.Despite all of its faults it was still a pretty enjoyable film so I'll give it a reasonable 6 out of 10.",Urban Legend
320,parker20000,A Short History about Nonsense,1,18 August 2000,"After watching this movie tonight on TV, I really felt  frightened like a rabbit. Having watched TV since the knowledge of the On/Off button of the TV-set there are not that many movies exciting me and surely this one is not eliciting the slightest extrasystolic stroke of my heart.Hollywood movies, are what they are. They devour money like a hungry bear and the outcome is the same as the worthless bear´s.Now a small dissection of the movies anatomy.The Surface: After examining everything for a while you come to the conclusion that that the plot outline is the same as many others you have seen before, or just a mixture of them. ( Scream, Helloween, The Simpsons...)The Character study: There are dummy-characters, you know they gonna die during the next half an hour ( let´s title them canonfodder ). They are normaly either timid or crazy or easygoers. Then you need characters to distract the moviegoers from the real evil guy. Two types of them: the really suspicious ones ( often hunchbacked, one-eyed, three-legged or whatever -->let´s classify them as cheap-suspects) and the more decent ones ( they always seem to be your best friend--- In 95 % of the Hollywood movies the real murderer is hidden in this group ). Then you need one or two main characters ( normally hero and heroine ), who will survive anything in 99 % of the cases. Furthermore you need some assholes ( doing always the obvious WRONG thing, but still persisting that they are right-- In 50% of the cases they will meet their doom ) and a lot of happy people around.The Inner Parts: 1. Why for god´s sake everybody in that movie wore the same overcoat ? Megasale or what ? 2. Why would someone go to a swimmingpool, dressed like an  Eskimo, just to take the coat of near the bassin ? 3. Why a murderer is always near you, all the same if you are in the desert coincidently, ran for ten hours into the wilderness in whatever direction, closed fifty doors behind you and when you take a rest the murderer is already there. A rabbit and hedgehog paradoxon ? Teleportation ? A case for Stephen Hawking ...? 4.If you call someone, no one will answer you, but instead sneak towards you, put his hand on your shoulder and frighten you to death. Maybe I should treat my friends like this too. 5.Instead of defense, move towards the corner of a room sit down and cry: ""Oh, dear evil person please don´t kill me"" Effect: a 100% dead sure. 6.Being a woman, eating two bullets, falling down at least five meters to the ground, opening a car and hiding there ( of course  after you have taken your axe with you ) for let´s say an hour ( still bleeding !) until your last burstout of energy, which will bring you into the most fortunate situation of falling down again 20 meters from a bridge ...Wow what a spectacular death for such an evil woman !! 7.In almost every horror movie during the climax-phase there have to be a thunderstorm, and when it happen that you urgently call the police, they tell you, that they are all out. Why ? Why everyone ? What may be the reason for it ? Coordinating the traffic ? Saving kittens from a sure thunderbolt-death in the trees ? A murder is normally not that important. But I believe, this the special time for all murderers to commit their crime and therefore chances are bad to find a free policeman in an emergency. Yeah, I believe so. Especially if all Hollywood movies show you, that it is the best time, it must be the best time. 7.If you here faint sounds of sirens, that means the evil person is dead and you are rescued, at least for that sequel (... but at last... strange ?!...police?.. here ? Thought they were somewhere else in mission ?)",Urban Legend
321,phlucy2,Absolutely Awful,4,4 January 2001,A big fat copy of 'Scream'.Laughable acting from Alicia Witt as Natalie.

You get introduced to a group of characters, some are annoying some are likable, and then they start to get murdered and you wonder who is the one who is the killer. Everyone is very good-looking too, which makes it easier to watch. My favorite was the blonde radio dj, who is played by the girl from American Pie.

It is funny, scary, suspenseful and just plain GREAT! The acting is great, Alicia Witt is the unexpected main role, in which she does a great job! Jared Leto is good also as is Rebecca Gayheart, who has a great role which she sinks her teeth into! The storyline is amazing and imaginative! The killings are done in a very clever way, using Urban Legends common to us all! The direction is beautifully done by Jamie Blanks from my country, Australia. The soundtrack is eerie and suspenseful. The best part though is the end scenes. Where the killer is revealed is just brilliant! The motive, the acting. I loved every second! Many people have passed this off as ""just another scream rip-off"" but it isnt! It is definetly worth a look! !t is one of my favourite movies of all time and will be yours.",Urban Legend

This movie follows the rules to urban legends instead of horror movies. This movie has great kills such as the Drain-O down the throat and even though this is not a death scene the Pepsi foaming out of the mouth like a rabies infected animal. This movie is fun so give it a watch if you can.",Urban Legend

327,summer_maru,One of my Favorite Horror Movies,10,9 January 2009,"Urban Legend takes place at a college in New England. The atmosphere of the movie is a large part of what makes it so good. Picture a New England mansion while it's raining in the dark. That's the feel of the college - and inside a comfortable home like area where the central characters hang out. The beginning interactions with these friends make them all very believable and real. Not shallow or just there to scream, run and get killed. One of the classes is about urban legends so the theme of the movie is are these really just urban legends or are they real? It's the 25th anniversary of the school's so-called massacre. Most students don't believe it but as friends go missing or turn up dead, one of the main characters, Natalie, believes it is not only real, but someone after her. Watching it now, so many years later, it's amazing how well known most of the actors have become. I was shocked to read that Michael Rosenbaum from the TV show, 'Smallville', was in this movie as one of the main characters. He looks so different, I would never have made the connection. And I've seen this movie a lot. I read someone call it predictable but I didn't think so at all. It was suspenseful to the end. Not knowing who you could really trust. Even after knowing what happens, something about this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. The characters become real and the ominous looking school with grounds going towards the woods gives it a real feeling of a New England town. In the dark...at night, would you say Bloody Mary three times in this superstitious place?",Urban Legend

The heroine could've at least acted like she had emotion. Tara Reid, a good actress (this movie an exception), just acted like an old 80s killer-chasing-the-bimbo bimbo.

330,cliosimonetta,OMG was that bad,1,23 January 2013,"Lame and stupid. The characters are so thin that a piece of white paper with a number would have been just the same. The story is predictable and the only twist it can menage is by stop making any goddamn sense. This is not really an horror, no supernatural element should be included here, which makes every scene damn unbelievable. The protagonist is annoying, downright stupid (she never, EVER gets it right, and I know some ten years old with more sense) and the movie tries to compensate the absolute lack of ""scariness"" by jumpscaring you for 1h and half. Just the same, old, useless teenage-slasher movie. To its honor, it kinds of tell you from the very beginning: ""hey, I'm lame nd stupid like the lamest urban legend you happen to hear when you hang out with stupid folks!"" So, it's not a surprise. If you are twelve, or very sensitive, or you never watch scary movies, you MAY find this scary. If not, be prepared to one of the silliest pieces of crap ever put on the screen.But in the end I must say: it IS kind of entertaining! It is so stupid, predictable, lame and trashy that it's kind of fun to watch. You got a night with friends, beer and taste for trash? This might be your movie. Sits down and enjoy the parade of clichés.

There's no way to differ between someone being murdered and someone having sex.5. Wearing a hooded jacket covers your face.6. If a guy at a gas station see's a murderer hiding behind the back seat of someone's car, he won't tell her until after she's driven off.7. A young, skinny teenage girl has the strength to murder a dozen men in two days.8. Being shot, and then thrown out of glass window from a tall building won't kill the murderer.9. College students in 1999 didn't have cell phones.10. The murderer will wait years to get revenge.11. At the end of the movie, the murderer will have enrolled in another college, and what she did will be considered an urban legend. Because unlike Columbine and Virginia Tech, the killing of a dozen students on a college campus wouldn't make national news.12. Also, the killing of 20 people on a college campus 20 years ago wouldn't be national news and a known fact, it would be an urban legend.",Urban Legend

Well, I finally watched it last night and was actually enjoying it up until the last half. The portrayal of the well-known urban legend murders are great, and even a little spooky...especially ""aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light"". I liked how they made reference to ones that you might not have heard of unless you're a real urban legend fan, like about the girl screaming during the Roller-coaster song. Unfortunately, it was almost as if they were trying to cram as many legends in as possible. And when you finally see who the 'real' killer is, it's such a disappointment it makes you regret spending your time watching the movie (I was also left wondering how she could have moved all those dead bodies by herself). I realize it's meant to be a 'unforeseen twist' a-la Scream, but...PLEASE! The Noxema Girl does not portray off a sadistic killer very well, and the reason behind the killings is even more comical than the killer herself.If you like Urban Legends, rent this one.

Alicia Witt was excellent as the heroine of the story, and Rebbecca gayheart gave a stunning performance as the psycho killer Brenda. she really knows how to act CRAZY (even if her motives are a little odd)!! and Jared leto is hot (i just had to add that). so if you love murder, humor, romance, and legends, ""urban legend"" is the movie for you. trust me, i've seen it about 500 times to date (and i first watched it last summer!).and FYI, it's on abc family for the ""13 nights of Halloween"" thing next month! i'll be watching it... will you??",Urban Legend

But it's a low budget 98 film and the storyline is pretty good, despite being simple.There are plenty of horror films based on Urban Legends, but not many which are about Urban Legends. The killer isn't too obvious and even though I suspected them at one point, I then changed my mind, then went back to them.The only thing I would have liked in this film would to have been told more about the Stanley Halls murders, maybe by the survivor, and for a certain hot girl to not have been killed! She should never be killed in films.It's a good film if you're having a sleep over, or a certain someone round for the night. You can talk about it, say who you think it is, I'm easy to make jump but it made my boyfriend jump too so, it's a good film, especially for what they had to go with.

However it does insult your intelligence sometimes like in the scene where Tara Reid's character narrowly escapes certain death and then runs into a nearby elevator when she could have just ran out of the front doors to safety. Also, there is a questionable scene in the beginning where a woman gets decapitated while driving a car and the killer miraculously survives and is even unharmed. But those are minor drawbacks which are present in almost every B-movie slasher.Still most of the viewing audience will probably discard this and consider it a trashy ""Scream"" rip-off, but for most of us die hard slasher-fans Urban Legend ain't too shabby. It's definitely not better than the Scream trilogy, but it's worthy of a viewing. I rate it 6/10. Avoid the sequel.",Urban Legend

What's disappointing is that every horror movie cliché is used here- horror theme music every time something happens, car stalls while killer prowls around, ominous telephone ring, desperate run from killer, the stunning 'anti-climax' and the shameless of gore and blood. The acting is over the top with every scream accentuate with the lame soundtrack. The last twenty minutes the whole thing falls apart as the film abandons all pretence of reality or cohesion.

If you watch horror movies to laugh at the horrible acting, like I do, then this is a definite movie. Great to watch with friends and make fun of the logic of the writers and the annoying blonde girl screaming and doing dumb stuff.

339,sausageroll2,Synopsis,10,10 February 2017,"It was an awesome horror-mystery film and Rebecca Gayheart played an excellent role of being the killer. The death scenes were incredibly brilliant. At a gas station, Michelle Mancini (Natasha Gregson Wagner) fights off an apparent attack by a stuttering attendant (Brad Dourif). However, he was actually trying to warn her of an attacker in the back seat, and as Michelle drives off, the attacker in the back seat decapitates her with an axe. On a college campus, student Parker Riley (Michael Rosenbaum) relates how one of the campus halls, Stanley Hall, had been the site of a massacre in 1973. The story is discredited by school journalist Paul Gardner (Jared Leto).As Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt) is shaken by Michelle's death, Damon Brooks (Joshua Jackson) offers to talk and the two drive into the woods. Damon is attacked by the killer, who hangs him from a tree with the rope attached to the car. As the killer approaches Natalie, she attempts to run him over, strangling Damon to death in the process. As the killer recovers, Natalie tries to drive away but Damon's body lands on top of the car, forcing Natalie to flee and alerts security guard Reese Wilson (Loretta Devine) who doesn't believe her when they find the car and Damon's corpse missing.Realizing Damon and Michelle's murders resemble urban legends, Natalie goes to the library where to read up on urban legends. She runs into Sasha who tries to assure her that the murders are unrelated. While she is away, her goth roommate Tosh (Danielle Harris), is strangled to death by the killer. Thinking her roommate is merely engaging in sexual activity, Natalie doesn't turn on the lights and goes to bed. In the morning, a shocked Natalie discovers her corpse and the words, ""Aren't you glad you didn't turn on the light?"" scrawled on the wall in blood.After trying to save Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) from a supposed attack in the swimming pool, Natalie reveals her past. One night Natalie and Michelle re-enacted an urban legend; they were driving with their headlights turned off and pursued the first driver who flashed them, causing him to run off the road and die in the crash.Next, the school dean Adams (John Neville) is attacked in the garage and run over by his car forcing the emergency spikes into his back. Later, Reese finds Professor Wexler's (Robert Englund) office trashed and smeared in blood. Meanwhile, Paul has discovered the Stanley Hall massacre actually occurred and Wexler was the sole survivor.At the party, Sasha gets annoyed at Parker for embarrassing Paul and leaves to go to the radio station. Parker gets a phone call from the killer telling him that his dog is in the microwave. After opening the microwave and seeing his dead dog, he then runs to the bathroom to vomit, where the killer ties him to the toilet and forces him to chug pop rocks and bathroom chemicals (instead of soda), killing him. At the radio station, Sasha (Tara Reid) is on air. In the background, her employee is being strangled to death. Sasha screams and runs out of the room; she is still on air and everyone can hear her cries for help. Natalie runs to her aid only to see the killer hacking her to pieces with an axe.Fleeing from the station, Natalie finds Brenda and Paul and they drive off to find help. Paul convinces the girls that the killer is Wexler. When Paul stops at a gas station, Natalie and Brenda discover Wexler's dead body in the car and bolt, thinking Paul to be the killer.

340,a-drivers-moon,Great Fun. A 90s Slasher That Has Aged Well.,9,10 December 2017,"Urban Legend is a movie that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to be. It's full of clichés and false jump scares, but they're pulled off by people who love clichés and jump scares. People tried so hard to compare this to Scream when it was released, but this proudly stands beside the very same type of movie that Scream was lampooning. Now that it's been nearly 20 years since its release it's easier to separate it from Scream and judge it as a straightforward slasher. Everything you love about 80s slashers is here, but with greater production values, and a greater reverence for the slasher movie rulebook.It's the type of movie that telegraphs every kill so obviously that you're not dreading who might get offed next, but rather eagerly anticipating the method of their death. It's the type of movie that casts Tara Reid as the busty blonde and then shoots close-ups of her cleavage when she runs. It's the type of movie that casts horror vets like Brad Dourif and Robert Englund as red herrings. It's the type of movie that features the killer's motive explained through slide show projector. Let's just say that it knows the slasher rulebook, and then excitedly checks off the list.One thing that might detract this movie's value for 80s slasher fans is the lack of nudity and gore. The 90s slashers filled their casts with genuine teen stars rather than unknowns looking for a big break and therefore they were less willing to risk scandalizing their audience. It's a shame because it's the one aspect of this movie that feels tame and dated, but other than that, it's a fun ride and a blast to watch with some friends.",Urban Legend
341,x_pink_princesscasey_x,"Brilliant movie, great storyline",10,10 July 2005,"Begins off very typically, a girl in a car, thunderstorms and radio on. When she comes to a gas station. The suspicious attendant gets her out of the car saying the credit card company is on the phone. When she goes inside and realises no-one is really on the phone she breaks off and drives off in her car crying. The next thing you hear is the gas attendant screaming ""Someones in the back seat!"" Then you just see an axe swing towards her in the car and the window smashes.... It continues to a typical American university where all characters are discussing the terrible murder. Only it wasn't an exception, people keep dying. One of the main characters used to know the girl who got murdered only she doesn't want to be questioned so keeps it to herself. She realises that the kills are following a deadly pattern and the murders are all in the style of various Urban Legends! As the number of characters go down, it becomes unclear who the true killer is, until the last scene which is very thought out and unexpected! A movie well worth watching, I was terrified when I first watched it. Ignore negative comments. THIS IS A BRILLIANT MOVIE!",Urban Legend
342,beachesrbest,A Classic 90s Horror Movie,8,13 January 2019,"As someone born in the late 90s, when I think of movies from that time I usually think about the teen-centric movies that came out that usually had overlapping cast members and a punk-rock soundtrack. I think about the fashion and the make-up and the hairstyles that are so specific to that time period.Urban Legend fits into that mold so perfectly, and when I watch it I feel this weird sense of nostalgia for a time that I wasn't around for. Kind of like how many 80s kids have fallen for Stranger Things or It, this movie has me longing for the late 90s.Sure, the movie isn't perfect, but it is fun. And it is completely aware of what it wants to be and who it wants to entertain. It knows that slasher fans will recognize the voice of Chucky as the gas station attendant. It knows fans will recognize Freddy Kruger as the professor. It knows that the characters are cookie-cutter stereotypes and fans will be able to guess who lives or dies upon first glance. But that's the whole point; Brad Dourif and Robert Englund are here to add a bit of fun and inside jokes, even in limited roles. Sex-obsessed Sasha is doomed from the moment she appears on screen, but we're not concerned whether she lives or dies, we're concerned with how creative her death will be (and guys with how much cleavage she'll show off before she croaks). We also know that Natalie is going to be our final girl by her conservative wardrobe and her blandly likable personality.Urban Legend knows all of this, and it works hard to make sure you know it knows what it's doing. I'd be hard pressed to find a more entertaining few hours than sitting down and watching this with a few friends when you're in the mood for a blast from the past.",Urban Legend
