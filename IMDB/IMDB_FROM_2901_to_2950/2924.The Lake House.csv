0,SnoopyStyle,Lovely love notes but just don't ask too many questions,6,9 June 2014,"Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) is starting a new job in Chicago leaving behind her rental lake house with a forwarding address. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) is an architect who just purchased the lake house. He's finds Kate's letter but there is something strange going on. He returns a letter that she receives. She writes him back. It makes no sense that she's saying it's 2006. It's soon obvious that he's actually living in 2004 getting letters from the future.Time warp seems to be a thing to inject into romances. It's a way to break out of the old clichés to create a whole new cliché for the genre. Both Bullock and Reeves are good romance actors and have a Speed reunion. As for time traveling romance, this is a light, slow moving one. If there is any passion, it exists in the exchange of little poetic love notes. However, it's not one that the audience should ask too many questions about. The characters don't exhibit the big excitement that a time traveling mailbox should instill in these characters. There are obvious avenues that the characters don't explore. The mailbox time travels for heaven's sake. In the end, it's the lovely actors that keep the movie on track.Spoiler ********* I hate the ending and I don't think it makes sense.",The Lake House
1,claudio_carvalho,Beautiful and Magical Tale of Love,7,30 January 2007,"In Chicago, the lonely architect Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) has a troubled relationship with his father Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer). In 2004, he buys an old glass house in a lake, designed and built by his father, and he finds a message in his mailbox from the former tenant, the also lonely Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), asking to deliver her correspondence in an address downtown. Alex meets his brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) in Chicago and when they go to the address with Dr. Forster's correspondence, they find a building of luxury apartments under construction to be delivered eighteen months later. After some messages, Alex and Kate disclose that she is living in 2006 and Alex in 2004, they fall in love for each other and they try to find means to meet each other.""The Lake House"" is a beautiful and magical tale of impossible love, with a wonderful chemistry between the gorgeous Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The story has many flaws and lack of explanations, and slightly recalls the idea of the excellent ""Sliding Doors"", but better off forget the inconsistencies and enjoy the nice love story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Casa no Lago"" (""The House in the Lake"")",The Lake House
2,gavin6942,"Less Entertainment Than Speed, But a Better Film",8,1 July 2006,"After over-analyzing this as I analyze everything, I discovered a variety of continuity flaws (not unlike the issues presented in ""Frequency""). But I enjoyed this film so much, I was able to overlook them.We have the team of Reeves and Bullock reunited; and as ""Speed"" proved, this is a romantic pair that works magic on the screen. I'm surprised it took this many years to get them together again. And from a director I've never heard of before (though whose work I will pay notice of in the future).The story is of two people connected by a lake house they have both lived in, and find themselves growing more and more in love with each other although they have never met. A series of interactions and some manipulation of time starts to make a real relationship possible. (Don't worry, this is not a sci-fi film by any means... it is perfect for a date and will not make you look like a nerd if you enjoyed it.) Reeves is not known for his stellar acting, but luckily for him this role is not that difficult (besides a scene where I thought his crying was a bit overdone... though I admit it made me sniffle). Bullock, also an acting lightweight, is in top form here -- lovable, romantic, sweet, intelligent and showing off a new hairstyle completely reinventing her look. After years of being anti-Bullock, I may have been converted.The colors are somewhat muted that gives it (to me) the effect of always being the autumn. I think this set a great tone that there was a constant sadness that could not be avoided. Not unlike ""Derailed"" and the gritty look of the filming.I recommend this film, and doubly so if you see it with a special someone.",The Lake House
3,jboothmillard,The Lake House,6,14 January 2009,"12 years since the lead actor and actress starred in Speed together, they are reunited for fantasy romance drama. Basically Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) is moving out of her lake house to begin work in a hospital, with a new flat in the centre of the city. Alex Burnham (Keanu Reeves), a young architect, is the new owner of the lake house, and working in the construction of some new buildings. Kate and Alex maintain correspondence, talking about the house, with letters put in the lake house letter box, but they both find out the letter box is some kind of time communication channel. Kate is living in 2006, while Alex is living in 2004, so Kate is telling Alex all about what life is like in two years time, and it seems they are falling for each other, even though they may never meet each other. However, Kate comes up with the idea that Alex should retrieve the book of Jane Austen's ""Persuasuon"" that she remembers forgetting in 2004, and Alex plans the same for Kate, he arranges a meeting in two years time at a restaurant, despite the fact she already has a boyfriend. Kate is not convinced with Alex when he doesn't show up, and she asks him not to write anymore, but thank goodness she realises the reason he didn't show up was because he was dead, so she sends the letter that saves him, telling him to wait two years and meet at the lake house, and they do. Also starring Christopher Plummer as Simon Wyler, Dylan Walsh as Morgan, Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Anna Klyczynski, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Henry Wyler, Willeke Van Ammelrooy as Kate's Mother and Lynn Collins as Mona. Quite an interesting romance film that apparently not many people make, probably because of worries audiences won't accept certain absurdities, certainly worth a whirl. Good!",The Lake House
4,moonspinner55,"Forget the house, what about that haunted mailbox?",7,21 October 2006,"A glass house built on stilts over a lake near Chicago helps bring together a condo-developer and a kissless female doctor who has just begun practicing at her first big-city hospital. The trouble between them is, he's writing to her from 2004 and she's in present day 2006, and their link is a mailbox with a sense of time all its own. Superfluous-seeming romantic drama with an initially-perplexing story conceit actually works better than you might think (thanks to some sharp writing and handling, and nicely underplayed lead performances by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock). Some of the plot elements don't bear close scrutiny (it might drive you mad to examine the details), yet fantasy films are governed by their own set of rules, and this one plays fair within its narrative structure, although it does keep the architect waiting an awfully long time just to get the girl. *** from ****",The Lake House
5,tavm,You have to be in the right mood to enjoy The Lake House,5,16 October 2006,"I just saw The Lake House with my mother and father. My dad left early on believing the movie was lousy. My mom and I stayed and while I understood most of what was going on, Mom kept getting confused until nearly the end. I think the ending was a little confusing for both Mom and me and it wasn't until I read many of the Q and A blogs that I understood both the timelines and why things happened at certain times. Both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are wonderful in their leading roles and Christopher Plummer and Shohreh Aghdashloo are equally good in their supporting ones. If you don't think too much about the logic of sequences, you may get carried away by the romance of the movie with the beautiful Chicago scenery. Me, I'm still wondering how it ended the way it did...",The Lake House
6,edwagreen,Don't Jump in the Lake House 0*,2,11 April 2007,"Absolutely dismal story of a current occupant and past one of a lake home. They meet by mail and must find a way for a more meaningful relationship until it's too late. As far as I'm concerned, it was already too late. The film is quite dull and Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock both appear to be totally frustrated with it.There is a cameo appearance by Christopher Plummer who portrays an embittered father, who as a famous architect never got over the fact that his wife left him with the 2 sons. Plummer quickly exits due to two heart attacks that he suffers. Unfortunately, this film is enough to bring another one on.One day, Bullock sits with her mother outside only to witness a man struck by a car. Though she portrays a physician, there is little she can do but watch the victim expire. There is also little that can be done with this film. A real total sleeper.",The Lake House
7,michaelRokeefe,A mystical romance. Boring!,3,27 September 2006,"You've got to be kidding. There have been stranger things, but I don't think director Alejandro Agresti intended this to be one of them. THE LAKE HOUSE finds Dr. Kate Forster(Sandra Bullock)moving from her visually stunning lakeside home to an apartment in downtown Chicago. The new tenant of the lake house is frustrated architect Alex Wyler(Keanu Reeves), who starts receiving notes from the lonely doc. They soon find themselves all wrapped up in their correspondence and soon realize they are meant for each other. Nothing strange about that, except she is living in 2006 and he's in 2004. Thus a long-distance time-warp romance. I actually fell asleep somewhere in the middle.",The Lake House
8,sunwarrior13,A Decent American Remake Of A Korean Love Story,8,8 October 2011,"The Lake House is a story between two marginally depressed people namely:Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock),a doctor who once resided an unusual lakeside home also known as the Lake House and Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves),an architect who happens to be its former occupant. Their romance begins when they exchange letters via a mysterious and magical mailbox.The Lake House is a remake of Il Mare.So how does the Korean original compare to the Hollywood remake?In my opinion,Il Mare was a lot better than The Lake House.Here are the reasons why.1. Il Mare keeps the audience guessing as to what is going to happen next while the plot is clichéd in The Lake House.2. You care more about Han Sung-hyun and Kim Eun-ju in the Korean version as compared to Alex and Kate in the Hollywood version. Credit that to Jun Ji-Hyun's performance as she has the ability to make you sympathize with her characters in her films. While in the Hollywood version, Keanu Reeves is not fit for any kind of romantic leads for he is more suited for action films like Speed and the Matrix.3. There was more emotion in the Korean version as compared to that of the Hollywood version. You know that the leads do care a lot for each other. 4. The Korean version focused on both leads and their loneliness while the Hollywood version involved more characters which made the viewer felt less for the emotions of the leads.5. Finally, the use of mailbox and writing letters was probably still common in South Korea during 1997 and 1999 in the Korean version while the use of email,Google and the internet was already a way of life in the United States during 2004 and 2006 in the Hollywood version which made the plot of The Lake House less realistic and presented more plot holes. For movie fans who loves romance and love stories,check Il Mare instead of The Lake House for I give the movies a 10/10 and an 8/10 respectively.",The Lake House
9,jotix100,"Valentine's Day 2004, 2006, 2008",7,2 July 2006,"Having seen a few of Alejandro Agresti's Argentine films, we decided to see what he had done with ""The Lake House"", his North American film debut. The choice is odd, because Mr. Agresti's films have never dealt in subjects so esoteric like the one in this before, something that American studios' higher ups love to give their audiences in the form of a romantic film.""The Lake House"" is a re-make of a popular Korean film, ""Il Mare"", which seems a strange title for a film from that country. The original screen play by Eun-Jeong-Kim seems to be the basis that David Auburn, its adapter, used to ""translate"" the film and made more accessible.We are taken to a beautiful property by a lake near Chicago, where both Alex Wyler and Kate Forster lived in. There are things that keep puzzling the viewer as he sits through the movie. The best has to do with the way the letter box outside the house serves as the indication of how Kate and Alex communicate with one another, but is it real? We keep getting indications along the way that perhaps their meeting, fleeting as it was, only serve to frustrate the two lovers because of the constraints of time.Kate and Alex loved one another deeply, but they were never to enjoy the love they felt because things kept getting in their way. There's always the two year difference that at the end seems to make sense, but which keeps us guessing throughout the movie.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock worked together before. They show an easy chemistry that makes the viewer root for them because we believe they sincerely love one another. Both actors make a great team and one can see why they were cast together. Others in the cast include Christopher Plummer, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Dylan Walsh, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, among the featured players.""The Lake House"" is a romantic film that will delight especially those that have loved and lost a dear one.",The Lake House
10,utgard14,Pretty Good,7,13 January 2015,"Enjoyable fantasy romance with a good script built around an idea that is more clever than your average mainstream Hollywood 'chick flick.' Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves reunite over a decade after Speed, a much different movie in which they both had some of the best chemistry either has had with another lead in their respective careers. Here they share few scenes but the ones they do share, that wonderful chemistry is present. They're a treat to watch, together or apart. Both do an amazing job selling an outlandish concept in a realistic setting. Some obvious logic flaws exist with the plot but it's so enjoyable it really doesn't matter. It helps that the movie has a great supporting cast, including Christopher Plummer, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Willeke van Ammelrooy. Pretty Lynn Collins has a thankless part and Dylan Walsh plays a 21st century Ralph Bellamy 'also-ran.' There's quite a nice soundtrack here, too. It's a good movie that I would recommend you check out, with or without your significant other. Any movie with clips from Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious is OK with me.",The Lake House
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Something for both members of the couple,7,25 January 2010,"I haven't watched the Korean original, and did not know of it when I first found out about this. You'll have to look elsewhere for comparisons. The obvious joke to make about this is that one liked it better when it was called Frequency, but honestly, this isn't half bad, and it does go an interesting and unexpected place or two. Given the specific type of movie this is, the ending is largely predictable, and the ""twist"" of this was obvious from the set-up. This is a (slightly) different way to go about the romantic comedy, albeit the concept is, as already noted, no longer entirely original. The time-distortion, alternate reality or whatever you want to call it works nicely enough. What makes this work is that the two leads have chemistry, and that this is one of the times where Reeves' performance is fairly convincing. The acting in general is pretty good. This is well-paced and not boring. The editing and cinematography are mostly straightforward, with a few nifty tricks here and there. Lines are so natural and smooth in their writing and delivery that you almost don't realize that a handful of times, the letters back and forth sound as if they're IM-ing each other. This offers a sci-fi angle for the guys, and the emotional aspect for the girls. That was probably the pitch. There is a little mild language and violence in this. I recommend this for anyone that the plot and idea appeals to; just know that this plays safe and stays within genre conventions. 7/10",The Lake House
12,george.schmidt,Unlikely romance : Reeves & Bullock re-united and it feels so good!,8,7 September 2006,"THE LAKE HOUSE (2006) *** Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Christopher Plummer, Shohreh Aghdashoo, Dylan Walsh, Ebon Moss-Bachrach.Winsome and winning romantic drama with fantastical elements about it: to wit, Bullock and Reeves play star-crossed lovers set apart 2 years with the only common link, the titular edifice they both acquired, and a magical mailbox that gets their cosmic love letters to and fro (!) It shouldn't work but it does on an all too-human scale and some lovely chemistry between the ""Speed""sters too. The fine location shootings in Chicago give it an extra oomph as well.(Dir: Alejandro Agresti)",The Lake House
13,Uriah43,A Man and Woman Separated by Time,7,2 November 2018,"Upon moving out from her beautiful lake house a woman named ""Kate Forster"" (Sandra Bullock) puts a letter in her mailbox for the person moving in asking that her mail be forwarded to her new address. Much to her surprise she finds that her letter is replied to with a strange response saying that the house she is referring to has been vacant for several years. Needless to say, this perplexes her and so she puts another letter into the mailbox assuring the person that she has lived in that house until recently and that includes the current year of 2006. Not only that but she also repeats the request to forward her mail to an address in nearby Chicago. This now puzzles the new resident, ""Alex Wyler"" (Keanu Reeves) who is living in the year 2004 and when he checks the address listed by Kate discovers that the apartment building is not due to be completed until 18 months later. So he responds that there must be some mistake only to get a letter back telling him that he should dress warmly because if he is living during the time he claims then there will be a freak snowstorm that night. Sure enough, that night it snows. Not only that, but when he puts a letter in the mailbox for her the next morning he is startled to get a response within minutes. Likewise, she is also shocked when he answers within minutes to her as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an adorable fantasy-romance film which has several interesting twists and turns along the way. Admittedly, there were a couple of subplots which tended to detract from the story a bit but even so I enjoyed this movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",The Lake House
14,ferguson-6,Paw Prints on the Walkway,4,4 July 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, you know it's a lousy movie when the best things are a house and a dog. Granted, it's a cool little lake house and very unique dog, but this is no exaggeration.Reuniting ""Speed"" co-stars Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in a parallel universe love story probably sounded like a good idea on paper. The biggest problem with this is movie is what happened on paper. Screenwriter David Auburn (""Proof"") offers up some lame dialogue and a timeline full of holes. Based on a Korean film named ""Il Mare"" (the name of the fancy restaurant in the film) I can only hope that the Korean version makes more sense and comes with less syrup. Argentinian director Alejandro Agresti can't escape criticism here either. Some of the scenes are poorly constructed and pieced together as if in a rush.Bullock looks fine, but can anyone buy her as a DOCTOR? And what about Keanu as an ARCHITECT. How about giving us something that makes sense? On top of that, we are subjected to the worst (and this is really saying something) Paul McCartney ballad not once, but TWICE. At least Christopher Plummer provides an anchor as a famous architect and Reeve's estranged father.I won't touch on all the ""what abouts"" and ""why nots"" in this film. My only advice is, if you feel the need to see this one, wait for cable.",The Lake House
15,anaconda-40658,Stick This Film in a Mail Box and Send It Far Away.,3,2 July 2015,"The Lake House (2006): Dir: Alejandro Agresti / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Christopher Plummer, Dylan Walsh, Lynn Collins: Boring romance about connection. Slow plot regards letters exchanged in a mailbox between two people that share the same lake house two years apart yet seemingly parallel. That makes about as much sense as performing brain surgery on oneself. It is so boring that I actually started reading during the screening. Around me were people whom should have brought pillows for all the yawning done. The ending attempts to play games with fate that make even less sense. Director Alejandro Agresti does his best to display emotion, and the lake house looks inviting in its glass form but the screenplay needed shipped away in a magic mailbox to the address of someone who could write something that comes across less ridiculous. Keanu Reeves plays an architect and Sandra Bullock plays a nurse. We are reminded of their great collaboration in Speed but here they play out a boring charade that ends in tragedy for one while the other just looks like a long sad face. Christopher Plummer appears as Reeves's father in a rather cardboard performance. Reeves sums up the theme when describing the house as possessive and connecting. Unfortunately that theme is lost amongst endless romantic clichés and much nonsense. In the end it is about as exciting as watching paint dry. Score: 3 / 10",The Lake House
16,gradyharp,A Visual Feast for a Time Travel Love Story,8,28 September 2006,"Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory. Based on a Korean film 'Siworae' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn, Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him. The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely, if a bit too uninvolving.Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) currently lives in the lake house (we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate. The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times, but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet, the riddles are unexplained, they fall in love over the distance of time, etc. There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle.Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story. A family discourse among Reeves, Plummer, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Henry, the other brother) never gels. The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do. In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful, thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography, and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine. It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script, but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content. Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine. Grady Harp",The Lake House
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Lake House,7,26 July 2006,"I haven't watched Il Mare, the Korean original starring Jeon Ji-hyun, in which this Hollywood remake is based upon. I refuse to watch the original on VCD, and had no luck in tracking down a DVD copy. I guess it's just a matter of time before I order it online, some box-set no less.In any case, what probably excited audiences to the remake, is the pairing of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, one which has been long overdue since their very first pairing which sizzled with chemistry, and that being on an action movie no less - Speed. While both had moved on to star in various romances with other counterparts such as Charlize Theron, Cameron Diaz, Bill Pullman, Ben Affleck and Harry Connick Jr., the wait is over as they now reunite on screen in The Lake House.But throughout the 100 minutes movie, they share not more than 15 minutes of screen time together, and those are precious minutes which will have the audience inevitably rooting for something to happen. Especially so with the time-travel note-in-the-letterbox plot device where comedic, smart alecky words slowly turn into mushy terms of endearment. Reeves and Bullock, considerably aged from their first outing together, are perfectly cast as the unlikely lovers separated by time.However, to fit into the typical Hollywood finale, there's a huge plot loophole in the time travelling piece, which I find a pity, then again, it's probably an ending that most people would expect, and crave for? As the story progressed, there were no issues with time travelling being in the way of the narrative. Keanu's Alex is an architect in the year 2004, and Sandra's Kate is a doctor in the year 2006. They are occupants of a house on a lake in Chicago, and slowly find that through a strange twist of Fate, they are communicating with each other through an old fashioned mailbox.And because one person is ahead of the other in time, Alex is able to see and come to know the Kate of year 2004, except that at that point in time, she doesn't know him yet. It's one of the usual story techniques used to work an emotional reaction from an audience, and here, it's executed perfectly too, as they work towards a reunion meeting in the year 2006, then 2008. Good things, ought to wait, no?Eagle eyed viewers though, will spot a key plot revelation early in the movie, and will be able to unravel the entire plot thereafter. However this probably wouldn't mar the enjoyment of the film, as the focus will be on how the story gets told, and admittedly, that's the draw which turned out fine, until the end where the film decides to go heck with the time travel crutch it has to rely on.Modern day stuff and devices are not included, like email and cameras, as modes of communication between the lovers, which will obviously remove a lot of romanticism from the movie, and shorten the duration too. To fill time in what could essentially be a short movie, and to vary the kind of scenes instead of the usual voice-over communications and reading of letters, there is a subplot involving Alex's dad (played by veteran Christopher Plummer).The Lake House, in my opinion, is a reasonably wonderful romance movie to take a date too. It's full of clichés, warm moments, and enough tension built up towards the end to satisfy, and with that plot loophole, provide enough material for you and your date to discuss it over.",The Lake House
18,siderite,"Interesting concept, but boring, nonetheless",7,29 March 2007,"The romance in this movie is really weak. And for a romantic movie, that sucks. It was a rather original story, with two people separated by a period of two years in which they communicate through a magical letter box. They use only to share their feelings and occasionally save each other's lives. No lottery tickets, no explanations and, for the few friends that share the secret, nothing weird about it.Keanu Reeves played one of his worst roles ever, while Sandra Bullock, without doing anything really wrong, was remarkably unremarkable.And what about Christopher Plummer? What was his role in all this? Just for show? Just to fill up space (and time)? And I can't but feel for Dylan Walshes character. Every time he wants to buy or rent a house with his girlfriend she runs with someone else. Actually, the same guy, every time.Bottom line: my wife liked it, so I guess they did something right romantically. I almost fell asleep.",The Lake House
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,A pleasant surprise,8,24 November 2006,"I tried my best to stay as far away from The Lake House as possible, it looked incredibly corny and like another stupid love story that would just make me gag...*the notebook*. Not to mention Keanu Reeves doesn't NORMALLY work well in a romance movie, he usually seems off cue or doesn't seem that interested. But I have to say for two actors who didn't see much of each other in front of the camera(only 3 scenes), these two actors had more chemistry than I have seen in a long time.Alex is an architect who moves in a lake house, he gets a letter from the ""previous owner"", Kate. She tells him to forward any of her left over mail to her place, but there is a problem, her place in his time hasn't been built yet, they soon figure out that they are two years away from each other. But they continue to write letters to each other and end up falling in love with one another.I'm so glad that I took a chance on renting this movie, it was a free rental for the club I joined at Hollywood Video, and I figured to just give this movie a shot and it turned into one of the better surprises in a long time for me. I would highly recommend The Lake House, it doesn't go overboard with the corny cliché's, Keanu and Sandra had great chemistry and over all, I'd just say that this is a very good movie.8/10",The Lake House
20,sddavis63,A Low-Key Romance Across Time,4,12 September 2009,"Stars Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves offered what I thought were extremely low-key performances in this fantasy-style romance in which they play Alex and Kate, two people who fall in love in spite of the fact that their relationship is happening two years apart in time - she living in 2006 and he in 2004. This happens because, somehow, they're able to write to each other across time, their connection being that both have lived in the same lake house, built by Alex's father (what I found to be, in all honesty, an unnecessary role played well mind you in a curmudgeon-type performance by Christopher Plummer) years before. The mystery of how they were able to do this is never explained, but that was fine, although that mystery could have been used to better effect. Still, it's a romantic fantasy, with the emphasis on ""fantasy""; not everything needs explanation. Bullock and Reeves didn't grab me, though. Their time- travelling, pen-pal type romance seemed to start far too easily, given the implausibility of the relationship. That implausibility isn't a criticism of the story, by the way, but of the romance itself. The across time relationship didn't bother me, although at times the time-line seemed a bit ""off"" somehow. It just seemed to me that two intelligent people would have been far more suspicious and uncertain about what was happening than these two seemed to be. I figured out pretty early why the car accident near the start of the movie would be important, and, in the end, regretted the decision of the writers to go for a sappy, romantic and predictable ending rather than the heartbreaking but more powerful and equally romantic (although in a more tragic way) ending that the car accident could have led to. That decision was in keeping with the overall ""low-key"" feel to the movie I mentioned at the start of my remarks, though. The movie has a lot of similarities to ""Frequency,"" although I found that to be a much stronger and more interesting piece of work. This was at best not bad. 4/10",The Lake House

Moving into Chicago proper Kate leaves a letter to the houses future occupant Alex to forward her mail to her new address. Keeping in touch with the houses future tenant Kate to her shock finds out that he actually lived there two years earlier in 2004 and as for now he's nowhere to be found!***SPOILER ALERT****Not that it's was such a big surprise in the first place Kate in fact did find her man of the future, on Valentine Day 2006, very early in the movie but didn't have any idea to just who he was since she hadn't yet met, or remembered, Alex in a past meeting back in 2004 where he knew who she was but she didn't know him.Like a bouncing ball the two lovers, who for the most part never see or hear each other, go back and forth from 2004 to 2006 through the wormhole-like portal of the magic mailbox for almost the entire movie until the very end. It's then when were,and Kate, told that the time is actually two years into the future February 2008 from non other then Alex's younger brother Henry, Ebon Moss Bachrach.Besides this very unusual and time-traveling love affair in the movie we also have Alex's dog Jack who is something of a connection, like the mailbox, between the two lovers in that she turns out to be both of Alex's and Kate's pet in different periods of time. Were also given a both heart-warming and heart-breaking relationship between Alex and his old man papa Simon Wyler, Christopher Plummer, in explaining the vast generation gap between father and son. The old guy is the one who built the lake house some thirty years ago after his old lady, whom he worshiped the ground that she walked on, walked out him. It's never explained why his wife walked out on Simon but just from watching him and how he acted in the movie it didn't leave much to one's imagination to why she did.After we get about enough of Simon's self-centered, about himself, and both miserable and snotty attitude, about the rest of the world, he suddenly suffers a sudden heart attack and ends up in the hospital. As if getting laid up in a hospital bed was not enough Simon later goes into cardiac arrest and expires freeing his son or sons, Alex & Henry, to live their own lives without having him putting his two cents into them.The movie really stretches reality beyond the limits even more then it already did with it's totally and completely off the wall ending that was about the only thing left that could have saved it. The relationship between Alex and Kate should have been left in the past and thus allow the two to go on their separate ways in the future. But instead*****SPOILER*****it bought the two together in the most brain and time twisting sequence since the equally off the wall ending of that time travel turkey of a film ""Frequency"" but nowhere as entertaining.",The Lake House
22,Robert_duder,A unique spin on the romance genre,8,8 July 2006,"It's been fifteen years since Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves shared the screen and their return to the screen is in a very unique romantic/drama that is moving, eerie, and a taste of something different. Anyone who says the plot of the film is not plausible is stating the obvious. The Lake House adds a bit of mystery/science fiction to it with the idea of time travel. Neither character are traveling in time but rather the letters they send are traveling in time. Still you are met with the same time paradoxes that are dealt with in many other time travel films such as things changing for the person in the future (Bullock) as the person in the past (Reeves) changes them. A huge portion of credit as to why this film works has to be given to director Alejandro Agresti. His unique showing of the two lives that intersect over their letters is well done and brilliant. It's such a neat thing when he has both of them in the same room but two years apart, it's an amazing effect.Keanu Reeves plays architect Alex Wyler. And herein lies one of the problems of this film. Reeves is rather drab and emotionless save for one scene when his father dies which is a powerful scene but otherwise his rather emotionless performance hurts the film a great deal. However he does show more emotion and a better performance I thought than his co-star which is very unusual. Sandra Bullock plays ER doctor Kate Forster who has bought Reeves' Lake House two years after he inhabited it. Bullock who at one time was bubbly, and funny, and completely entranced you in this kind of role is completely drab and boring and has little to no life in her. It's really sad!! I know the film is a heavy drama with no comedy to it but even still she doesn't bring any life to her character. Their chemistry together is unmistakable, fortunately for the sake of this film they have fantastic chemistry and I hope they work together again. Now I must mention supporting actor Shohreh Aghdashloo. Recognize the name?? Possibly not but this lady has been popping up everywhere as of recently. I first came to know her on 24 as the protective mother and scared wife Dina Araz, but since then she has had roles in The Exorcism of Emily Rose, X-Men The Last Stand, and now The Lake House. She plays Bullock's close friend and fellow Doctor Anna Klyczynski. Although her role is small she does well as the mentor to Bullock and plays intelligent characters quite well. (Interesting to note that all three of those roles I mentioned have all been doctors.) Reeves' counterpart/friend that is necessary to all romance stories is Ebon Moss-Bachrach who plays his brother Henry Wyler. His role is quite small too but he does the most with it and does a decent job although Reeves overshadows him in any on screen time together. Also notable is the amazing Christopher Plummer as Reeves' father Simon Wyler. The man has become a master character actor from his days of leading man status which I don't think is a bad transition at all for someone who is 78 years old. He adds class to any film and it's always great to see him on screen.The thing that makes The Lake House work is the magic, the twists, the unique style of time travel and the relationship between the two characters although two years apart. They quickly yet substantially have the characters fall in love and meet in different situations. Reeves' meets and speaks with Bullock's character but she doesn't know him yet because Reeves' is two years in her past. I am proud of myself because I nailed the ending to a certain extent. I knew right from the first moment SOMETHING happened (I WILL NOT give it away) that it would effect the ending. What I didn't expect is they pulled a serious Back To The Future move and made everything okay so you still got a terrific happy ending which is always nice for romances. At times you might feel like you're a little confused by what is going on, I mean time travel films can be complicated and when you're telling an intersecting story that is two years apart it's bound to have some complications but stick with it, pay close attention and you'll figure it out in the end. I don't think it was overly complicated or hard to follow, in fact I think it was brilliantly done given the premise behind it. Lovers of romance and magic will adore this film and despite some rather low key, bland performances it truly is magic and unique and one of the better romance films of the year so far. 8/10",The Lake House
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It's confused, cheesy and just kind of dull.",5,8 October 2018,"There's not really all that much done with the central conceit, so it just ends up coming across as an extremely long-distance relationship - which it's an allegory for, anyway - as opposed to anything more fantastic or original. On the few occasions when 'The Lake House (2006)' does try to do anything extraordinary, the concept isn't treated with the consistency required to make its 'stand-out' moments clever; instead, they just come across as kind of confusing and, frankly, a bit cheesy. There's not all that much to the film in general, either, as it all feels sort of aimless, despite the fact that its central relationship (which isn't really rendered with all that much clarity or believability) takes up the majority of the screen-time. This isn't helped by the fact that the pen-pal premise often falls short in its execution - feeling far more like several in-person conversations (including sarcasm, laughs and, worst of all, interruptions) than anything resembling letter-based communication. On top of all that, the seemingly natural, much more interesting darker ending is swapped out for a traditional 'Hollywood' one, with a final beat that trades tragic sobs for a soppy and strangely sloppy kiss. 5/10",The Lake House
24,MLDinTN,I just didn't buy it,6,19 April 2007,"The main problem with this movie for me is it is just too ridiculous to believe in a magic mailbox. I like Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. They work well together and are believable as too people falling in love through letters. But the fact that the time line is 2 years apart and no one says this is utterly impossible is ridiculous. Everyone just accepts the fact that this magic mailbox delivers mail 2 years apart instaneously. Even when they tell someone else that person has no problem believing the whole premises. And with any movie about time travel, there are always many plot holes you can point out.Overall, the romance is pretty good, but the story could have used some humor. There was no quirky best friend like there usually is.FINAL VERDICT: If you fans of the 2 stars, it is worth watching; otherwise, there are better romance films out there.",The Lake House

Yeah its about two people who are receiving letters from one another, yet they have never met. I think thats just pure bs and really lazy coming right out of Hollywood's minds.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are great actors but I definitely think this movie wasn't for them.

A lukewarm relationship has left her cold to possible involvements and she takes solace only in her dog and a house by the lake. One day, she finds evidence that someone else lived in the lake house, a man named Alex, a builder. As unlikely as it seems, they begin corresponding through the mailbox outside the lakeside establishment. The two get closer with each letter. However, Alex is in a time warp two years prior to the current year. Will they ever be able to meet? The dog seems to be able to slip through the time difference, why can't they? And, what other complications will arise? No one who loves romance will be able to resist this film. It has a story that grabs hold of the viewer and does not let go. The performances by Bullock and Reeves are lovely and touching. Reeves, especially, surprises and delights with his sensitivity but, then again, this is his year, with the outstanding Scanner Darkly also under his belt. The Chicago setting and costuming are quite nice, too. Yes, there are probably some Swiss cheese holes in the film's logic but it does not matter at all. To see two beautiful, buoyant actors giving it their all is more than enough for any viewer. Ladies, get your friends or significant others to watch the film with you. Being female, you will hang on every word and someone should be there to give you a hankie or squeeze your hand.",The Lake House
27,tabuno,A Solid Romantic Comedy-Drama,8,22 January 2019,"18 June 2006. Warning: Spoilers. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves put together the ""Speed"" chemistry in the best romantic comedy since Sleepless In Seattle. The director added little touches that put a shimmer of magic to the time shifting movie of romance. While predictable, the inevitable tension remains compelling, the wishful, tearful drama is drenching, the dream fulfillment a summer delight. Except of an unexplainable appearance of a book and the relatively lightness of the subject matter, and the not completely 100% notion that Keanu Reeves benefited from the script or vice versa (could another actor have accomplished the same?), this movie hits the balance tone, humor, and seriousness to make this shifting movie a fun, entertaining summer, date movie. There are some cute special effects that are a delight consistent and enhancing the plot. The edited well done, considering the more difficult continuity required of this movie. Overall, this is a surely a solid and commendable product for the romantic film audiences the world over. Eight out of Ten Stars.",The Lake House

They must try to unravel the mystery behind their extraordinary romance. It's not hard to see what attracted Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves to this movie. Reeves had not had a big solo hit since ""The Matrix"" whilst she was looking to bounce back from ""Miss Congeniality 2"" so Reteaming with a costar from one of their biggest hits seemed like a good idea. Sadly ""The Lake House"" is not the movie I wanted it to be. The plot didn't make much sense, and I'm still not 100% sure I understand it (A time travelling mail box and all that) But the romantic in me still enjoyed a lot of it. Reeves doesn't put in one of his best performances but Bullock remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply.

32,johnnyboyz,An Intriguing love story with a science fiction twist .,8,5 March 2007,"Although not usually a fan of the romantic, love story comedy tie in genre; I thought I'd watch this never the less and I came away from it with an opinion I didn't think I'd get.About half way through this film, two characters are sitting in a bar and talking to one another. They are mother and daughter. The mother says to the daughter in an exclamation of surprise with a hint of regret that ""one minute they're babies, the next they're off to medical school."" This suggested to me that although the person you really love is so close to you that you can touch them  time is the factor that gets in the way. Time ages the daughter to the point that they have to move out to pursue greater things and time is very much the antagonist for the daughter (who happens to be one of the main characters) as it is the span of two years that is keeping her apart from the person she loves; this time a different kind to that of a family love.By the time this scene has happened, I was already rather engrossed in a surprisingly simplistic plot formula about two people living two years apart but whom shared the same lake house of the title. The unique selling point of this film is indeed the fact their communicating in two different years and this is, from the very beginning, highly intriguing. It's never forced down our throats and the time it takes to develop not only between the two protagonists but as a whole is as interesting as it is funny.I think the main problem people have with the film is either the acting or the script but each character shows the emotions of loneliness, confusion and intrigue at different times rather well and this is down to some, albeit rather easy given their professional status, good acting from both Bullock and Reeves. The dialogue they're given is not terrible; it's steady, simplistic and progresses at a satisfying pace. They exchange letters that are initially shrouded in confusion but enlighten up into meetings and other such plot advancements that keep you watching as to what will happen which I found it to be rather effective. Even if you can look past the fact that both characters actually take the phenomenon rather lightly when it's first discovered and the fact they do, at times, exchange letters like they're talking on an Internet messenger programme (ie; rather quickly), you will still find an intriguing, sensual, down to earth film that sticks to its roots and carries a pleasant feeling that it's not too late for either of them throughout.",The Lake House
33,filipemanuelneto,When two great romantic actors come together...,6,28 March 2017,"There are many movies about impossible loves but the reasons for the impossibility can vary. One of the rarest is used in this film: each element of the couple lives in a different temporal reality, despite both are living in the same place. Its a challenging resource, which can easily fall in the danger of becoming implausible. Unfortunately, this has indeed happened here. If we start thinking hard about the movie, the magic of love disappears and we see clearly the fragility of the premises on which the whole story is based. Its really far-fetched.The strong point of the film is the excellent chemistry of the two main actors, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. They are both very strong in romantic roles, and the way their characters value letters as form of contact brings a note of nostalgic romanticism that is very elegant.

38,dfranzen70,A cut above most romance movies,7,29 October 2006,"I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised by The Lake House. It's a romantic drama - a weeper, if you will - that really has no business being all that good, since it does depend on quite a suspension of disbelief. But work it does, thanks in no small part to the powerful chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves; even more so when you realize they spend, a la Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail, only a small part of the movie in the same scene.Bullock plays Kate, a lonely doctor in 2006 who communicates, via an apparently supernatural mailbox, with the former resident of the lake house in which she used to live. Reeves plays Alex, a lonely architect in 2004 who lives in that lake house. One thing leads to another, and through the magic of their written words, they begin to fall for each other, much as Tom Hanks fell for Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail before laying eyes on her, or (for you older readers) Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan in The Shop Around the Corner. Alex lives in 2004 at the same rate as Kate lives in 2006; each day proceeds apace.It's all very poignant, especially when other aspects of the lovers' lives play out, allowing the various plot points to weave and intersect with each other. If there's any real complaint to be made, it's that things make a little too much sense, that when anything happens to either protagonist, it's answered later on in the movie. There are no loose ends, which - if one were not completely swept up in the awesome, unlikely romance between Alex and Kate - would seem a little too pat and contrived.Happily, one IS swept up. If you're a guy, you can't help feel for Reeves' character here; he has a stubborn, perfect father who's always held his children at quite a distance (played by Christopher Plummer, who's had irascible characters like this for more than fifteen years now), and he has a successful career - though not as illustrious as that of his father, and he's as emotionally silent, living alone physically and emotionally. Bullock's Kate is much the same way; for all of her success as a physician, she merely settles for a man to be with for the proverbial rest of her life; she does so because she needs to, not because she wants to.Bullock hasn't been this good in some time - yes, much better than she was in Crash, where she was merely annoying. She's sweet and lovable and everything that caused us to fall for her back in 1995 when she did While You Were Sleeping. She's also very well lit, by cinematographer Alar Kivilo. Reeves sheds the ""whoa"" persona - oddly, I totally expected him to recite his trademark when he first reached into the mailbox to find a note from Kate - to turn in a quiet, effective performance that isn't afraid to show its feelings at times.The Lake House is a charming, elegant film that really does unabashedly tug at your heart strings. We know we're being manipulated, but when the result is this entertaining, who can complain?",The Lake House

This is one of my favourite movie conceits and I was always going to be a sucker for a plot that doesn't assume I'm a KFC-munching,Pepsi-sucking mobile phone addict with the attention span of an intellectually-challenged codfish.

I have absolutely no intention of revealing how it all resolves,but I will advise you to keep the tissues handy.

The movie spans several years, has fantastic secondary characters (a very mean Christopher Plummer, Dylan Walsh, Shohreh Aghdashloo) and the glass house on silts is beautiful to look at but I sure wouldn't want to live there.Initially the story is a bit jumpy, what with the 2 year time issue, doggie footprints and letters being exchanged (as conversations). I also never did figure out what was up with the dog, which time was he from? Who owned him? There were also some sections in the movie that dragged or were just plain boring; like the scene where Alex and Kate meet at a party and talk and dance for like an entire song. If I'm honest it was also about halfway through that I realized how depressing this movie was: unrequited love and bus accidents and Sandra's character in general who's so morose.Still, I liked it and that kiss at the end, wow could you ever feel the true love and desperation to just ...touch. 5/26/15",The Lake House

I think they should be paired more often,, Anyway to the movie,, aside from some confusing parts,, yeah you really need to pay attention, with the time-line, and who's reality you're in.. i liked it a whole lot,, there was maybe one or two times the movie stood still for a few mins.. and most of the movie i understood,, Sandra Bullock gave to me pretty much an Oscar winning performance, seeing her cry in front of that mailbox would bring tears to anyone's eyes. Keanu's performance was pretty good also,, also worth mention is that Christoper Plummer was in the movie,, and was very funny as Keanu's character's dad. all in all i think it was a pretty darn good romance movie with a subtle twist.",The Lake House
46,EUyeshima,Only for Non-Cynics...Romantic Serendipity Found Through Handwritten Letters and a Time Warp,8,19 June 2006,"I doubt if I have seen a movie so willing to suspend credibility and logic for the sake of conveying an idealistic romance, but Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti (in his American film bow) and screenwriter David Auburn somehow manage to keep their convoluted fable afloat despite the layers of fantasy-driven contrivance. Underneath it all, the 2006 movie is really an old-fashioned 1950's-style woman's picture, and one wonders what Douglas Sirk could have done with the material in a lavish Ross Hunter production. Instead, we are given a precocious, time-jumping tale detailing the improbable romance between Alex Wyler, an angst-driven architect who has become a condo developer, and Kate Forster, a lonely doctor. Their common thread is the unique glass house designed by Alex's father that sits literally on a lake near Chicago, where both have lived at different times. They correspond through handwritten letters, but the twist is that they are existing two years apart and have only a magical mailbox to transcend the time difference.The fantastical premise sounds silly, and to some degree it is, but in a surprisingly effective manner, the filmmakers and cast take it all quite seriously. It's all about execution and the emotional subtleties in the script. Luckily, Auburn dances around the credibility issues with a swooning sense of romance. The externals capture the feeling as well - Alar Kivilo's crisp, autumnal-to-wintry cinematography and Meg Everist's set decorations both capture Chicago at its most cinematic; and Rachel Portman's evocative score filled with music from baby boomer icons like Carole King and Paul McCartney. There is a sense of déjà vu in Sandra Bullock's Kate since the actress has played variations of the same lonely girl over the years, though she has gratefully dropped her perky demeanor for a more resonant performance. Keanu Reeves is sincere as Alex, though a bit too overtly new-age-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability.Individually Reeves and Bullock convey the solitude of their characters with a minimum of fuss, and when they do connect, they generate real chemistry in rather creative ways. That's what really matters with a movie like this. The supporting cast consists mostly of unsurprising stock characters, in particular, Dylan Walsh as Kate's insecure intended, Morgan, and Lynn Collins as Alex's anxious co-worker, Mona. There are three international veterans who inhabit their roles with more verve and individuality - Shohreh Aghdashloo worldly wise as Kate's workaholic colleague; Christopher Plummer hammy as Alex's irascible father; and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy (of ""Antonia's Line"") full of romanticism as Kate's widowed mother. As contrived as it is (and if you have seen Brad Anderson's ""Happy Accidents"", you will notice plot similarities), the ending does satisfy in a way loyal to its genre. The movie is definitely a wallow but a well-done one.",The Lake House

You have to not analyze or scrutinize it, and simply watch the characters, living through something.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have a nice chemistry. What is truly lovely about this film is there are no stupid jokes, no caricatures, no oversimplification. Keanu Reeves is simply someone whom Bullock would or could have met earlier in her life. They both look nice together; very natural.The lake house itself is a metaphor; Christopher Plummer is interesting as Reeves' stoic architect father, telling him he must learn to live more for his creativity.The sets are beautiful, and this seems like a non-Hollywood film.

49,dierregi,If you like romantic with a twist,8,15 December 2014,"If you want to enjoy ""The lake house"" you should know that it requires plenty of suspended disbelief and no rational approach.Chronologically, the story ""sort-of"" starts in 2004, when Alex comes back to the Chicago area and settles in a glass house built many years previously by his architect father. Alex and dad don't get along, even if they share the same profession.In the house Alex finds a note from alleged ""lodger"" Kate, who recently moved out with regret to central Chicago. However, Alex knows that the house was closed for years and writes back to Kate, basically asking what is wrong with her. A correspondence follows between the two, during which they discover that Kate rented the house after Alex, possibly in 2005 (the timeline is a bit confused) and she moved out at the beginning of 2006.The two exchange letters using the mailbox outside the house, regular postal service clearly not being an option. Although I agree that writing letters is very romantic, one may wonder why they do not exchange photos, emails or phone callsThey quickly discover to be soul mates and Alex tries several times to meet Kate. It should be remembered that in 2004 Kate is still unaware about his existence, so when they actually meet the experience is very different for them. To complicate things, Kate has a boyfriend in 2004 – but not in 2006.Alex knows to be in love and want to be with Kate. At this stage, enters the plot twist, which feels highly contrived even in such an unlikely scenario. However, we are supposed to root for Alex and Kate, two people who can truly connect with very few around them and who are bound to be together against all odds. Will 2008 be the year when they can finally be happy together? The time paradox is the most intriguing part and should be explored more in details, but the movie can still be considered a satisfactory, unusual romantic movie.",The Lake House
50,vertigo_14,Time traveling romance is scant on detail and heavy on formula. (spoilers),4,2 July 2006,"""The Lakehouse"" is yet another in a long list of rather dull summer blockbusters (or really, anticipated blockbusters). Although a sweet story if you're simply looking for mindless romance and a well-known cast (although once again, Sandra Bullock carries the film as the Keanu Reeves' limited range even in costume makes him a miscast once again).The story involves two similar, single people. Bullock is the charismatic, but pessimistic Kate Forster, a woman who has basically given up on love after another failed relationship. She admits that she has a fear of commitment, or rather, attachment. It's easier for her to keep people at arm's length. Enter (conveniently), her counterpart, Alex Wyler (Reeves) who knows that personality type well, as his father has done best to keep he and his brother in an emotional void (a character trait even revealed in his architectural manner). He is the kind of guy who is trying to distance himself from that, but of course, he needs the right girl to motivate him out of the slump. So why don't these two just get together? Because, for unexplained reasons, they are living two years apart.Ah, the time traveling theme. A complicated plot or an over-simplistic plot are both victims to the dreaded narrative pitfalls: plot holes. Only, I suspect that the writers might have been trying to avoid just that by leaving all of the time traveling details unexplained and, also prevented reducing it to a film of science over romantic themes. For whatever reason, the two are able to contact one another through this lake house that Kate once lived in (she's living in 2006) and Alex (in 2004) is now living in. They are able to communicate in letters delivered to their mailbox, and eventually, in person (sort of) and, despite the two year gap between them, they are even able to have conversations.The movie does begin confusingly if you were not yet able to catch any previews to explain this mess. The juxtaposition of activity at the lake house, taking place first with Kate and then Alex, and cutting back and forth, it passes unnoticed. After a while though, the movie settles into limited explanation and soon enough, straight into predictability. It's a cute story, but an almost unimpressive one because, this is one story that, despite some differences, has played out year after year in the Hollywood reels.There was some interesting visual play at work here by what looked to be filmmakers trained in commercials. Scenes, for example, where Kate and Alex are sharing a walking tour through Chicago reminded me, with some of it's split screen and fading, of 1980s fashion commercials as well as the 360 degrees documentary that they run at the Canadian pavilion in Epcot.The rest of the film, while cheerful and at least, romantic, it is nonetheless a forgettable film (a shameful waste of Bullock's talent, for sure) and certainly not worth the ten dollars they charged for opening night. The summer blockbusters at this point, really have yet to impress.",The Lake House
51,triple8,Calling all romantics-this one's for you!,7,18 June 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:The Lake House had some really really excellent moments. The love story was certainly different and reminded me a lot of the film ""somewhere in Time"" which was also very moving. The story was almost magical and though a lot of plot holes existed, one does get caught up in wanting Reeves & Bullock's characters to find their way toward each other in the same time period. This is a movie where good casting is crucial to whether the plot works. In this case the casting was great because Bullock & Reeves both have this quiet wistful sort of brooding quality to them and it works for them, and for the film.The cinematography must be mentioned as well. There was a touch of magic through the story that would not have been there without the visuals. And what visuals they were too. The lush, open aired scenery had the same components as the two main characters and that made the movie captivating lovely to view throughout the picture. It is not difficult to fall under the spell of the beauty of the lake house and the surrounding greenery. The movie would have been absolutely nothing without the help of excellent cinematography.The music was also helpful. It, like the characters and scenery, was haunting, with a certain sweetness about it. All of Those things are the reasons why I give The Lake House a 7.But in spite of all the positives, something was missing. I do not know exactly what it was. Perhaps it was that, though the story was magical there was something about the way it played out that fell short of perfect for me. When the two main characters start corresponding, neither of them act the least bit surprised when they discover their in two different time periods. That happens fairly quickly and it was kind of baffling. Shouldn't there have been a bit more shock? That interfered with the believability aspect.The implausibility of the story was NOT, in my opinion what hampered my enjoyment because ""Somewhere in time"" was also improbable but I felt it was done better. That, for me wasn't the main problem here. I would have perhaps liked more things explained at the end though. I'd have also liked more of a slow lead up to what happens. I also felt the movie was a bit to talky and though I happen to love talky movies, it didn't quite fit here. And there were moments that dragged and scenes that didn't flow. I will admit at the end I was sort of disappointed.If this review is sounding negative I don't mean it to. If I was a professional critic I would recommend it, but only mildly so. I thought it would be an instant 10 for me but it was not, though that may change on a second viewing. (This seems like the type of film you should view multiple times.) One other positive was the chemistry between Reeves and Bullock. That scene where they dance together was up there in pure romance. Many have criticized both of them but I think their two of the most likable movie stars around and their chemistry is real and palpable, not in a sizzling way but in a very sweet believable manner.The Lake House is a good movie that I'd give a 7.5 out of 10 to but people who don't like romance dramas or have problems with plot holes in their films should probably stay away. Ultimately I was a bit disappointed but I was also touched and have to admit there was a certain beauty to this film that is quite refreshing to see. My vote is 7.5 of 10.",The Lake House

And she leaves the sofa before he does and empties the fridge. and the whole question throughout this tense and exciting movie is whether he can run fast enough to arrive three and a half minutes before she does at the lake house. It's all a giant laugh riot. That is when it's not being a gripping, wrenching, terrific, poignant romance. In the sequel Keanu will be living two seconds before B*llocks but it won't matter because his brain is underdeveloped. For extra fun bring a watch and keep an eye out for this amazing coincidence: The movie is composed of exactly 20.79 three and a half minute segments. amazing. In the films finale, Sandra B*llocks ships hersef off in a carton C.O.D. to Keanu, but the package falls of the mail boat and as she gurgles her undelivered love to him, there isn't a dry eye in the house, or the box for that matter.",The Lake House
53,Seraphion,Nice twists and ending,7,22 January 2015,The movie really builds a good story and serves nice twists which wrap themselves well with the ending. Like Frequency (2000) there's no real time travel since the different time characters link one another through the time traveling mail. The story may just end right then and there when Alex sees Kate on the train but the creators decided to trade that with an even greater twists. I really like how the movie puts the circular story loop that ends with the beginning. And that gimmick makes it a classic Valentine's Day movie for me. The acting overall is quite nice. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are reunited after their old blockbuster hit Speed all those years ago. This movie sure shows that the chemistry between them from that old movie is still a helpful thing to make this movie great.,The Lake House
54,Galina_movie_fan,"""Can this be happening? """,6,16 April 2007,"""The Lake House"" is a romance in letters which is ""kind of a long distance relationship"" between two people that live it the parallel worlds separated by a span of two years and somehow connected by a time-traveling mailbox. If anything, this movie connected once again Sandra Bullock as a physician who moves out of her lakeside house to live and work in Chicago and Keanu Reeves, an architect, who lives in the house right now (the concept of ""right now"" plays an important role in the movie). Two begin to communicate via letters left in the mailbox and suddenly realize that they are as far away from each other as 2004 and 2006 are. If you watch the movie in the right mood with the right person, you could think of it as a sweet, moving picture about longing, about getting close to someone whom you may never see but not be able to get them out of your mind, and who become to you more real than anything you've ever known. You will see the gentle and intimate site of Chicago that you did not know even existed. You will be moved and entertained...If you are not in the right mood, you'd begin looking for the logical faults and plentiful holes in the plot and you would say scornfully, ""another chick flick with Keanu as a romantic hero"" - so, it is up to you.6.5/10",The Lake House

I know it's a fantasy movie where I am supposed to forget the reality, but the fantasy needs to convince me it could be real. And in this case, Lake House failed pretty hard. I know it would get boring if they showed the couple writing the letters every time, just hearing what they wrote is satisfying, but all of a sudden we get to see them talking to the mirror and to each other at the same time. If the director just kept on hiding them from the camera and making they speech what they were writing/reading would be much better.Also, I don't know how someone is able to LOVE somebody more than everything in one's life just writing to each other for some months.

It's more or less a standard romance with a gimmick thrown in for good measure. (spoilers) The side-stories were somewhat boring, including advice and rough-roads with separate parents, and it was sort of pathetic how the Sandra Bullock's character Kate used the other man (the character Morgan) as sort of a fall-back relationship. Surprisingly the guy rekindled the relationship after already witnessing a full-on kiss during her birthday - not the friendly kind - but the ""suck face"" variety. That aside the mail-box as a gimmick was amusing although the movie-makers chose to disregard the time-paradoxes as there always are with time-travel - and (spoiler) anyone could see the main surprise plot twist a mile away.

58,MartianOctocretr5,Kindred spirits separated in time,8,19 June 2006,"""Lake House"" is a wonderful romance story, but must be viewed in the right vein. If one looks for plot holes about altered time lines and so on, this film is an easy target. However, for the romantics in the audience, allow this fantasy romance tale any poetic license it requires, and you'll be rewarded with a pleasant and sentimental movie.The premise is intriguing: two people who lived in the same house at different times establish communication through letters that inexplicably traverse time. To pull this story line off demonstrates a superior acting job by the two leads.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are splendid together in this, even achieving better screen chemistry than they showed in ""Speed."" The plot is involved, since frequent leaps back and forth in chronology are an absolutely essential plot device for this premise. In fact, these jumps are foundational to the whole idea. The director has found many creative methods to illustrate the chasm of time that separates the two characters; my favorite is the ""new message"" alert they each receive, which is brilliant in its simplicity.One major twist pivotal to the story may not fool everyone; it's a little on the obvious side. Yet even if you catch on to the setup for this twist, the strongly emotional script involves you enough to ignore the loss of a surprise ending. Both principal characters have pain and struggles in their respective lives, and these back stories meld extremely well into the equation of their metaphysical romance. They both have chances to help one another through these problems, in moving and ingenious ways.A superb romantic fantasy that needs you to allow yourself to believe.

62,jaredmobarak,You're going to think I'm crazyThe Lake House,7,22 April 2007,"There are many romantic comedies that I enjoy due in most part to the laughs and fun scripts they bring. As for the romance/love genre, I would say there are very few which I would want to experience again. Without the humor, these types of films generally seem too contrived and trite, just a way of killing two hours with a result that you know is coming before you even begin watching. I shouldn't generalize all movies of this ilk because really, it is mostly American love stories that annoy me, whereas a film like In the Mood for Love is a masterpiece of story, tone, and emotion. With that said, I am not surprised that last year's The Lake House is another Asian import reworked for the US. Why am I not surprised? Well, the answer is because I found myself enjoying pretty much the entire film. It is by no means a perfect moviemore on this laterbut for a love story, I found myself completely caught up in it and waiting anxiously to see what would transpire. I can only imagine that the Korean original, Il Mare, only improves what is shown here, and I am very interested to see if that is true.It is weird because most of these films that I don't like are because the ways two people are finally put together are so out there, that it could never happen in real life. Coincidences don't happen that perfectly ever. However, with the orchestration to get two kindred souls together in a real world takes me out of a film, it is surprising that one with a premise about two meeting each other through a mailbox, two years apart, actually works for me. Maybe it is the fact that they get to know each other while so far apart. Without being on screen together for the entire movie, you don't start picking apart their performances and lack of chemistry. These two lovesick characters, played effectively by both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, create a huge amount of chemistry through their reactions, alone in a room, reading the words from the other. You start to anticipate the eventual meeting and the sexual tension increases to the point where you generally start to worry it may never happen. Even when they are together, one of them doesn't yet know who the other is, so every encounter is like they are meeting for the first time. In effect then, they fall in love almost three times during the course of the film, each one as genuine as the last.Besides the acting being quite good, emotions running high as they each share the tragedies which have occurred in their lives, the actual realization of the situations are very well done also. For one, the cinematography is often times beautiful to look at, whether is be running from behind a layer of trees, the blurred split-screen two years apart of even the angles used to get close-ups of our leads, it is a sight to behold. As far as the effectiveness of the time travel aspect, even this is done in a mostly believable way. The moments where they change history through their letters, like the tree in front of Bullock's apartment, they are integrated that second, like they have been there forever. As for encounters in the past, they are always in their memories, even if they don't quite remember them clearly. Something that is done in the past doesn't change the future because it has already happened, in just took two years for it to be meaningful enough to recall.The ending is the only part of the film that may leave a bit of a plot-hole. An action by the one creates a major shift in what would be an entirely different two years as a result. The audience must take a leap that everything would have continued the same with that one moment changed, and because it is at the very end, you kind of don't get enough time to question it, so it does work. Besides this, I do have one other problem with the ending and that is the happiness of what happens. I am interested to see how the original concluded, because maybe they did it how I would have wanted, ending tragically because of their correspondences. The final revelation, although obvious, could have carried out in sadness and I believe have been more effective as a result. Ending in tragedy would have made the bond between them during the rest of film more powerful, knowing that the short time they had together was true love and meaningful. Instead we get a happy conclusion with the future left open as one of infinite possibility, While it still works, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Hollywood changed the ending to make viewers feel good, rather than see the true meaning of love and how it transcends the physical world by letting fate decide what happens, turning their actions, unknowingly to them, into a journey ending it tears.",The Lake House
63,fwomp,A Clunky Romance Surrounded By Poor Science,2,30 September 2006,"THE LAKE HOUSE fails on so many levels that it's tough to pin down one thing viewers will dislike the most. Be it the multiple unexplained fantasy elements, or the lame acting, or the dumb-downed plot, this film will most likely make you shoot popcorn out of your nose, not in laughter, but because of incredulity.A time-traveling mailbox (and, apparently, canine) bind two lonely souls together at a lake house. The place was built by Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer, INSIDE MAN) for his now deceased wife. Being a successful architect, his sons fall into the family business too. One of these is Alex (Keanu Reeves, THE MATRIX), who purchases the house in 2004. Trouble is, though, the house is already owned ...in 2006. Not usually a problem, but apparently these two years in time are connected somehow. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock, CRASH) is the 2006 year owner and has just sold the place. She leaves a note for the new owner to send all mail to her forwarded address. But the mail gets picked up in 2004 by Alex, who's confused about the date she put on her message. When he sticks his reply in the mailbox, Kate picks it up ...in 2006, two years later. The two form an ""across-time"" romance, trying to meet up in Kate's year but failing. They do bump into one another in 2004 but neither realizes the importance of it.Okay, let's start with the basic problems: Why these two and why a mailbox? The two individuals chosen for this event may be overlooked as mere coincidence. But the mailbox? Please! Kate and Alex are separated by two years in time but brought together by the mailbox. The big issue here is that neither of them find this even remotely disturbing or incredible. They just accept it. The assumption must be that the script and director wanted to move on to the ""more interesting"" love story surrounding the two protagonists. The problem here, though, is that the romance is anything but interesting. It's distant (like the years that separate them), and rushed, and poorly acted. Bullock and Reeves had more chemistry in SPEED (that ought to tell you a lot!).Time travel movies are tough to pull off to begin with, and the challenge for most of them is avoiding the paradox they create. The Lake House doesn't even TRY to address this problem and simply plows ahead without considering the intelligence of its audience. For instance, at one point Kate (in 2006) goes to an architects office and discovers some disturbing news. She rushes out to try and prevent it from happening by sending Alex a letter. And they do avoid the disastrous event. The trouble is, though, is that if it's avoided, then there never was an event to begin with because Alex avoided it in 2004, thus, in 2006, there wouldn't have been this problem for Kate to worry about. Some may not be bothered by this, but many scientists must be pretty ticked-off that the film doesn't address this issue.And the final tragedy is the acting. Both Reeves and Bullock CAN act. We've seen them do it. But here they are bland, boring, and completely unsympathetic. Even Christopher Plummer's character seemed forced and poorly thought out.Need a sleep aid? Put this flick in your DVD player and snooooooze away!",The Lake House
64,jon.h.ochiai,Waiting for the Right Time and One,10,17 June 2006,"In a great scene from ""The Lake House"", Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) tells Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) what she loves about Jane Austin's ""Persuasion"". What Kate loves about the book is that love can occur at the wrong time, and even when the characters wait it doesn't work out. Alex again inquires why it is Kate's favorite. Kate laughs. Magical chemistry. This is part of the brilliant charm of Director Alejandro Agresti's ""The Lake House"". It is a touching and funny love story about Kate's conceit that you wait for the right time and for the right one. Those familiar with the movie's trailer know that in the story by David Auburn (based on previous work by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo) that time is the insurmountable obstacle posed to Alex and Kate. As the story opens, Kate (Bullock) is a lonely doctor dedicated to ""helping people"" who leaves this exquisitely designed lake house outside Chicago as she begins her residency in the city. She leaves a note to the incoming tenant in the mailbox. Alex, a talented architect who sold out on his craft to build tract homes, receives Kate's letter. However, for Alex it is 2004. For Kate it is 2006. Yes, this involves time travel. But fear not. There are no treaties on worm holes or Special Relativity. Agresti instead focuses on impact of completing relationships and true love.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are awesome together as Kate and Alex. Along with Agresti, they create Kate and Alex as both lonely characters, not in the morose sense rather people caught up in their lives without any compelling romantic relationship. Bullock is wonderful as Kate. Reeves, who is often much maligned as wooden, embodies an ease and compassion in Alex. Bullock and Reeves are great looking, and they are a great looking couple. Their screen chemistry overcomes the inherent narrative constraints. ""The Lake House"" so works, because we want to see Alex and Kate get together. David Auburn's story enrolls us in Alex and Kate's love story. Alex is estranged from his father Simon Wyler (the cantankerous Christopher Plummer), who is a legendary architect in the realm of Frank Lloyd Wright. Upon the prodigal son's return after traveling the world and selling out on his gifts, all in an attempt to ""forget"" his father, Simon asks ""Did it succeed?"" When Alex was 8 years-old Simon built the Lake House for his wife, Alex's mother. As Simon became successful and famous Alex's mother suffered and she eventually left. Later she became ill and passed away. Simon did not even attend her funeral. His cold words to Alex remained with him. In his eyes his father is a monster, but he is still his father and commands his respect though not necessarily his love. Kate (Bullock) had only one significant relationship in her life that being with attorney Morgan (a good Dylan Walsh)a nice guy, but not ""the guy"". Kate has also sold out on love, under the guise of dedication to her work. In a touching moment Kate's Mom (Willeke van Ammelrooy) tells her about the forsaken great love of her life. The preposterous dual time line works, only because Kate and Alex are smart, running with it without ponder. And they fall in love. Alex says to his brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), ""She's more real to me than anything I've ever known.""Writer Auburn brilliantly weaves the plot twists throughout and the results are funny and poignant. Acknowledge Auburn too, for the clarity in retrospect within the story particularly at the end. Throughout there are hints that Kate and Alex have met before. There is the train station scene that is so heartfelt, the theater was silent. Agresti and Auburn are great romantics. ""The Lake House"" is a testament to true love, and having one's life being whole and complete. They manage a sense of yearning and regret with humor and compassion. Sandra Bullock is stunning in her understated performance. She brings such a grace and authenticity to Kate. Keanu Reeves compellingly displays the swirling emotions just below the surface. Here his subtle charm is impressively leveraged. ""The Lake House"" is an amazing and timeless love story well worth seeing.",The Lake House
65,Danusha_Goska,"Rare, Hard Truths about Love Amidst a Spooky Plot",8,19 June 2006,"""The Lake House"" isn't just another dime-a-dozen romance movie.""The Lake House"" speaks some hard truths about love.Sometimes distance and restraint are the best environment to allow love to grow. Sometimes it pays to wait for love.Can we even say that today? In an era of sexual promiscuity and sex-drenched media? Does anyone understand that any more? That, sometimes, the best way to fall in love with another human being is not to see them naked and have sex with them on the first date, but to give the love time? Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are excellent together. They give the sense of having been together before, and, of course, they have -- in ""Speed."" The plot keeps the two leads apart for much of the movie, but when they are placed together in the frame, they create the warmth of glowing coals. You really do believe that these two are in love, not just in a passionate way, but in a friendly way, as well.The director places them in the same frame and has them read snippets of their letters to each other. One such scene takes place in a cafeteria. Sandra Bullock rests her chin on her hand as she listens to Reeves. It's a very moving, cozy shot.When they finally kiss, well, it's a keeper of a kissing scene.Reeves brings just the right amount of manly coolness and melted passion to his role. He goes from being a guy who would behave dismissively to a girl at work who has a crush on him, to being a man so much in love that he would kiss a stack of old letters.Sandra Bullock is Sandra Bullock -- luminously beautiful, and yet playing down her glamor, acting the lonely, nose-to-the-grindstone working girl, expressing solidarity with all the working girls watching her up on the screen as no other current female star does.Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston -- all lovely. Their performances all shout, ""Me! Me! Me!"" Sandra Bullock's performances shout, ""Us!"" Christopher Plummer is brilliant in a small role as Reeves' architect father.Shoreh Aghdashloo is sadly underused as Sandra Bullock's best friend. Romance stars need a confidante, especially in this movie, where the leads are so often kept apart. Bullock is issued her coworker, Aghdashloo, and her mother, Willeke van Amelrooy. That's one too many. The movie isn't long enough to make either character complete and memorable.I wish the director had done more to ease, for the viewer, the difficulties of the time differences between the two leads. Perhaps Reeves' portion could have been shot in black and white, and Bullock's in color.The movie is not perfect, in other words.But ""The Lake House""'s message about love is real and deep and beautifully delivered.It will be a shame if the unwarranted negative reviews this movie received keep viewers from the theater.I cried while watching this movie. It's been a long time since a recently-released, mainstream American movie had that effect on me.If you care about love and romance, don't miss ""The Lake House.""",The Lake House
66,jpschapira,Disappointing...,6,17 July 2006,"I am honored by the fact that ""The Lake House"" was directed by Alejandro Agresti, a recognized Argentine director, and although I could say the movie's better than it actually is because of my pride; I can't lie when it comes to reviewing a feature. This film is far from anything Agresti has done before, which is a shame considering this is his first project in the United States.However, it's not entirely Agresti's fault. His shots were very simple and his fading to black between most of the scenes wasn't innovating; but he achieved some frames of beautiful cinematography with Alar Kivilo (""Hart's War"") in the wonderful scenery of Chicago.The long and slow-paced screenplay by David Auburn is not entirely his fault either. I know I can't say that no one did things the wrong way, but Auburn based his writing in the screenplay of an old movie from another country, so; if that screenplay was lame, he couldn't have done it better.The unrealistic story is something to debate in the first place, but romantics like me don't discuss that. I tend to accept anything the plot of a romantic film presents, and I did with ""The Lake House"", but the development didn't convince meThe story went on for too long and the drama was a little forced.I can't also say it wasn't Keanu Reeves fault, for example. But he was a victim some years ago of another project, where the drama was forced too, and he accomplished a fine performance with the picture being below goodRemember ""Sweet November""? The female lead of that movie, Charlize Theron, also did a good acting job, but again; the story went on for too long.The female lead in ""The Lake House"" is Sandra Bullock, one of my favorite actresses. She's a good lead for comedy (""Miss Congeniality""), for thriller (""Murder by Numbers""), for drama (""Hope Floats""), for romance (""While You Were Sleeping"") and for action (""Speed""). In the last movie mentioned before, she and Reeves also worked together.Now they are both adults and consecrated actors and they didn't disappoint me in this film. Reeves, with his measured style, laying back and showing everybody, once more, that he's more than Nero. Bullock, with her unique charm and way of taking a role that makes us sense her as one human being more.Shohreh Aghdashloo didn't disappoint either, although my friends made fun of her because she kind of speaks like a man. And of course Christopher Plummer, as watchable as ever these last few years, taking supporting roles in films like this one or ""National Treasure"" and even ""Must Love Dogs"". So I guess that the movie itself was disappointing (as if I hadn't being saying it differently all over the review), with the cute mailbox and all.",The Lake House
67,Atreyu_II,Time paradox??,6,3 July 2010,"'The Lake House' is a very strange film. Actually, it made my brain ""hurt"" because it's very confusing and complex to understand - that's what happens towards such thing as time paradox.I'm not very inclined to romantic movies, even though deep down inside I think I am a romantic guy. But still I saw this one, more because it was suggested than for my own will. And also because I kinda like Sandra Bullock.Like I said, the movie is much too confusing and complex for my head. The movie loses much because of that (at my point of view). The whole thing of the guy and the woman living in the same date but separated by 2 years of difference (and the fact that the guy is supposed to be dead without any of us realizing) is very weird. Plus, in some scenes it's as if they are few meters away from each other and yet they exchange letters as quick as a ray of light (like they're not seeing each other) and the mailbox seems magical. And how the heck does Kate takes 2 years to realize that she loves Alex? Does it take THAT long to realize that? When it's almost too late? And how in the world does she want to give him her love but avoids him? I'm sorry, people, but none of this makes sense to me.And why would anyone name their female dog Jack? Why not picking up a feminine name, since the animal is a female? I didn't know Jack's breed, but now I know that she is a wire-coated Portugese Podengo (a dog breed that I've never heard of).The movie itself isn't all that interesting. One curiosity about this film (which may attract more viewers) is that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock star together one more time (they first did it in the original 'Speed').",The Lake House
68,Carycomic,It's not often that my parents and I have the same taste in movies.,10,17 June 2006,"This is one of those times.They went to see it opening night. I went to see it at a bargain matinée. And, my showing had a packed house! My folks swear the same thing about their showing. In short: we all loved it.At first, no one in the audience knows which one is two years in the past: Alex Wyler (Reeves) or Kate Forster (Bullock). That quickly becomes established with the help of a stray dog that seemingly adopts Alex. It runs through a roller tray of brown paint, rendering a previously written apology by Kate (regarding some indelible paw prints) much less puzzling.Then, there's the amusing sequence where Kate and Alex freak each other out with the Lake Houses's red mailbox flag. That's what really clinches the cross-time thing for both of them! Those who remember seeing and enjoying ""Frequency"" or ""Somewhere In Time"" will love this movie. It may be corny in a few spots! But, not intolerably so. And, those who like to play Sherlock Holmes will quickly deduce just why the pen-pals' big rendezvous does not succeed.

70,Darkside-Reviewer,"""You're gunna think I'm crazy!""",4,24 August 2020,"I'm not the biggest fan of romance movies but there are a few classics that I enjoy watching every now and then especially if I have gone through a breakup or am just feeling a little down. I always end up watching the same movies everytime like (Romeo & Juliet 1968), (Titanic) or even (A Lot Like Love) which is one of my favourites. I thought I'd try and branch out a little and watch some other romance movies that end up in my recommendations list because I watched a movie simular to it one of those recommendations being The Lake House.There are a few things that I really enjoyed about the movie one thing in particular was the intellectual conversations regarding architecture and classical literature I found the dialogue in some scenes to actually be rather interesting and thought provoking something I never thought I'd say about a modern day romance movie. There are also some genuinely romantic moments throughout the movie that do tug at the heartstrings a little and maybe even make you think back to a previous relationship and wonder what you could of done differently if you had the chance to change things.I personally didn't enjoy the movies main plot point of a time traveling mailbox that allows the two main characters Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) who lives in a lake house in the year 2004 and Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) who moves out of the same lake house in (2006) to exchange letters and other items between each other. I get that this is supposed to a romantic movie where the idea is that they both live in different times and they have to wait until the time is right to be together but there are just too many problems and plot holes with this idea that just ruin the whole thing for me this is mainly because I'm a huge fan of movies like The Terminator and Back to the Future famous movies that are basically staples of the Science fiction and Time Travel movie genres and their rules on time travel are stuck in my brain like a movie bug.The acting from Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is pretty good but compared to the first movie they were in together Speed (1995) this movie was a walk in the park for them especially when you consider the fact that they are only on screen together for about fifteen minutes of the entire movie as most of the scenes are side by side shots of them writing and reading letters out loud and even that's just voice over ADR work.I recommend The Lake House if your looking for a romance movie that can be clever and romantic but is also a little different than your usual romance movie just try not to over think the whole time traveling mailbox plot line and you'll enjoy the movie.",The Lake House
71,cariart,Lovers Across Time in Entertaining Romance...,8,8 December 2006,"While the concept of lovers from different eras is hardly new (Bing Crosby's love of Arthurian-era Rhonda Fleming in ""A Connecticut Yankee"", Tyrone Power falling for Ann Blyth in Revolutionary War England in ""I'll Never Forget You"", and Christopher Reeve's bittersweet affair with Gilded Age beauty Jane Seymour in ""Somewhere in Time"", are just a few examples), the novelty of 'fated' lovers separated by two years, bonding through letters in a magical mailbox, gives ""The Lake House"" a unique poignancy all it's own.Certainly, there are leaps of logic to contend with (Sandra Bullock could have easily have tracked down Keanu Reeves at any point, without protracting their rendezvous an additional two years, her relationship with her boyfriend is never resolved, nor is the fate of Jack, the dog, who simply disappears), but taken on it's own terms, the film is a very satisfying and romantic odyssey. Reeves and Bullock, who had a wonderful, goofy chemistry in ""Speed"", prove than they can handle a deeper, more mature screen relationship very well, with Reeves giving one of his best performances, and Bullock, whose career had stalled after ""Miss Congeniality"", proving again that she is underrated as a dramatic actress.Based on the 2000 Korean film, ""Il Mare"", screenwriter David Auburn has given the production a 'Classic Hollywood' luster, with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman's ""Notorious"" playing on TV, and an ill-fated rendezvous reminiscent of ""An Affair to Remember""; the presence of veteran star Christopher Plummer as Reeves' father enhances the 'feel'. While some may find this approach 'old-fashioned', Argentine director Alejandro Agresti recognized that a classic romance needed a classic approach, and, in my opinion, it succeeds quite well! ""The Lake House"" certainly deserves a look!",The Lake House
72,LazySod,Rocksolid love story,8,6 August 2006,"The Lake House is a remake of the Korean film Siworae (2000). It starts when a young architect moves into his new house and finds a letter from the previous owner in the mailbox. Based on this letter the two start exchanging more letters and eventually start liking each other more and more. Nothing too strange about that one, if it wasn't for the fact that he first moves into the house in 2004 - and she moves out of it in 2006.With that the story line is laid out - the rest of the film tells their complicated story and tells it well. It is hard to turn your back on the two characters that are both likable, and it is impossible to not want them to end up eternally happy together. The film is rather predictable though, but that fact doesn't really make it worse. It might have been better if it hadn't been predictable, but it just didn't matter that much.All in all Reeves and Bullock are playing each other very well, again, and they make the film into a very digestible story. I couldn't help but being pulled into it so deeply I had trouble getting out of my seat at the end of it. In completion, this is a strong and emotional film which is best enjoyed in a completely silent theater.I'm searching for the original film now. It will very probably be even better than this one.

Don't listen to the cynical critics, don't go in expecting to see science fiction, a time travel movie or some deep psychological drama, just go. Just go and listen to a good script with grown up dialogue, beautiful scenery and two people who find themselves in love under the most extraordinary circumstances. The acting may not be Oscar worthy but both Keanu and Sandra play the characters with conviction.

If it weren't for the trailer I wouldn't have known what the hell was happening. But in a nutshell, Bullock and Reeves begin communicating through a magic mailbox that allows them to exchange letters --- albeit her in 2006, he in 2004. The laughers start when the little arm of the mailbox would fling up and down as each would rush to the thing to read the latest pithy romantic drivel. Like a bad version of ""You've Got Mail"". Long story short, they try and meet over several time/date set-ups, between '04 and '06. Too complicated to get into, but the ""date"" involving time-warped Reeve leading Bullock all over town to see see goofy things left behind, was a major eye-roller. Plus the fact that both characters are thoroughly uninteresting and charmless. And a big hindrance being the pointlessly talky interludes involving Reeves and his dad discussing architecture, or Bullock and a gravel-throated friend. It all leads to a finish you were expecting, featuring one of the longer make-out scenes in a film. So, sorry to say, I found more to poke fun at than become engrossed in.

78,moviemanMA,Flawed,6,5 June 2007,"A love that knows no boundaries and can withstand the test of time. This is what true love means at least in the movies. If a love can still have the same energy no matter how far apart you are, then it is true and everlasting. But can love exist when two people live two years apart?Apparently it can. Alejandro Agresti's take on the Korean film Siworae is the story of two people living in Chicago. Dr. Kate Foster (Sandra Bullock) lives in 2006 while Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) lives in 2004. They both however occupy the same lake house outside of Chicago. They communicate through letters left in the mailbox. Impossible as it may be, these two become pen pals, writing about who they are, what they do, and what they have gone through. Also living at the house is Jack, the dog that they both share.Jumping back and forth between 2004 and 2006, we see how their lives, although separate, become intertwined through a series of planned encounters. Their relationship relies on patience, just like the romance of the novel Persuassion, a favorite of Bullock's character. The one connection the two share is their love of the lake house, a solid foundation for their romance.There is a certain mystical element to the movie that is captivating. The way the two cross the sea of time and interact through the mailbox is romantic and charming. At one point Bullock's character mentions that she misses the tress by the lake house and how there aren't any where she lives. Reeves plants a tree in 2004 so that in 2006 it will be there for her. Cute things like this make their relationship fun to watch.Agresti's camera work and overall display of the conversations that Bullock and Reeves have is adequate. In some scenes, both characters are present in the same place, talking to each other like you would with anybody else but the overlap on screen of the two years is put together nicely. There is however one rather large flaw.The short story by Ray Bradbury A Sound of Thunder is the story of a group of scientists who travel back in time and in doing so unintentionally kill a butterfly. This act has a ripple effect, changing the future drastically. This one little event changed the course of history. I realize that this short story is fiction but it does make sense. If you change the past then in fact you change the future. By planting the tree Reeves might have altered the environment or caused something else that makes a big impact.Keeping this in mind I can't truly enjoy the film. Certainly Robert Zemeckis's 80's classic Back to the Future delves into this but the outcome is desirable. Whow knows what can happen if you change the past? Luckily, The Lake House isn't a science fiction movie so it is not such a big deal.Overall the film is cute and original, at least for American Cinema. It has a nice story and a creative premise. It doesn't break any boundaries like the love in the film. For what it is, The Lake House is a nice piece of romance.",The Lake House
79,Flagrant-Baronessa,The Lake House remains afloat... barely,6,22 October 2006,"'Implausible' is an unfair label applied on its own but if the story itself cannot overcome its implausibility or make it into something interesting, then it deserves the stamp. Right in the forehead. Bullock-Reeves reunion The Lake House (2006) not only merits it, but demands it due to its disjointed treatment of parallel story lines and its inability to ultimately make something interesting of this mystery mess. Nevertheless, the film proves a fair diversion and pasttime.The centromere of these two story lines is the Lake House  a majestic, remote little estate with walls of glass and pillars of steel that overlooks a lake. When lonely architect Alex (Reeves) moves in there he finds a letter in the mailbox from a woman who claims to be the house's previous tenant, something that appears logically impossible... and is. Out of curiosity, he tries to seek out this woman but finds that the address she has given him to forward her mail does not exist; it is today a mere construction site. Confused, he sends her a reply through the Lake House's mailbox which she receives and responds to, thereby sparking the fuse of a fully-fletched long distance romance  two years apart in time.The Lake House is a shameless chick-flick, it needs to be said. It is also the reason why chick-flicks in general are given a bad name (when there are many good ones like Pride & Prejudice, Love Actually and Clueless). Here we have pseudo-magic, angsty vulnerable and lonely characters and their newfound crushes wrapped in Hollywood mush. The film pretends to be so sweepingly romantic that Alex never bothers to ask Kate (in the future) for the daily newspaper or winning lottery numbers. Instead they patiently communicate through insightful love letters, sigh romantically and stare longingly into space. It soon spirals into a messy, talkative and slow-paced ""You've Got Mail"" romp on magic.Keanu Reeves wears his confused, wooden expression during the film and Sandra Bullock opts for her usual mellow, sweet face. Yet for all their imperfections  and perhaps BECAUSE of their imperfections  they are two likable normal characters. I also think that the two have very good chemistry; indeed, were it not for that device the Lake House would have sunk almost immediately. Now it remains afloat thanks to occasional comedy, well-placed saccharine sweetness and an even level of modest 'watchableness'. The final twist is wielded with deft strokes and things finally work. But it never elevates above generic rom-com formula. Although serious props for playing Nick Drake.6 out of 10",The Lake House

83,HelenMary,rather charming metaphysical romance film,7,20 December 2013,"This film must not be approached that it's realistic or possible, it's a total fantasy for adults, and as such is rather lovely. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are back together, and their chemistry is good - although you don't see them together a whole lot. It is almost a sort of Time Travel theme... if you are interested in that sort of thing.The premise of the film is that two people start a correspondence through the medium of a weird mailbox and with the help of a raggedy dog, which looks similar to the one in Three Wishes (Patrick Swayze). It's all about how they try to see each other and their story unravels as they write to each other. It's rather clever and takes a while to get your head around, and just when you think there's a hole in the story or something you don't get you can work it around. Quite clever.Christopher Plumber is the distant father and is very good - some of the scenes with him and Reeves are the best in terms of performance. The acting... or rather the script is a little poor in places (don't get me started on the medical scenes), but it also has a real heart as well, and there's one scene (with the book) that always gets be teary. I liked the chemistry between Reeves and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (the brother) - they seemed to be very brotherly and get on well. What I like about this film is that it isn't predictable in that it has a few twists and turns that show the wit of the plot; it has a depth that might not be apparently on assumption or first impressions.The Lake House, the scenes and scenery in this are beautiful, the art direction is really stunning, it's attractively shot. The soundtrack is good too. How the story is told, through past and ""present"" shots, keeps the viewer guessing, or on the edge of your seat even if you've seen it before.Overall a sweet, interesting, not shallow or vapid romance with a difference that puts a new spin on deja-vu and long distance relationships.

This is a remake based on a Korean movie titled 'Il Mare', which I am intrigued about now. Asian films are generally more emotion/character based than Hollywood films (I feel), as not everything is over dramatized. Well actually Korean dramas tend to over dramatize the staring which I find very cheesy but I'll have to watch that one to be able to compare both versions of the film.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves did great in this film. Bullock is probably my favourite actress so there's that. The chemistry between them was so cute as well. Even though Bullock and Reeves are not actually in the same scene for a lot of the film they portrayed the bond that their characters have on screen really well. I feel like the chemistry they had when they weren't together was much better than when they were together. The ending scene just seemed a bit off.The editing too was well done. From the putting together of the film, to the soundtrack and the order of the scenes. The visual effects was a little outdated (but can't blame them since this did come out in 2006), but I could tell when she was in the bus/train that it was a green screen.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",The Lake House
86,karlericsson,embarrassing for all involved in it,2,9 May 2008,"Time travel films has its hazards and paradoxes - we know that. If you compare this film with ""Groundhog Day"", however, you will understand how infinitely inferior this film is. The idea isn't milked at all and given the premises, the people in this movie, the characters of Keanu and Sondra, behave like zombies. It seems as if they didn't even watch ""Back to the Future"" before they made this film. Somebody is two years ahead and communicates with somebody who is two years behind. Does she leak the lotto numbers or the like, which she might easily find out? Of course not - it isn't even considered. This is a love film and love doesn't need money - sure! That they belong together, they have found out through there correspondence and when they meet, she lets him kiss her although he only talks gibberish to her and nothing of the more ""serious"" stuff mentioned in the correspondence. That should be enough but instead ""he"" lets ""her"" drift away from him, because he didn't turn up on a rendezvous two years in the future, which could have thousand reasons for not functioning. She gets hurt but a little talk could have fixed that, if he was really as serious as he is supposed to be according to the story. And then he is supposed to wait 2 years - why? For becoming a billionaire with inside information about the future? Of course not. Just waste 2 years although they could have been together that time as well - they could kiss but they cannot do that - where's the logic? That's right, there isn't any!!! There's love - apparently stupid love and we all know how long that lasts or don't we? The idiotic love between two idiots, who don't want to think - no, folks, that isn't very interesting, is it?

87,tburke85,The Lake House A Decent Romantic Drama,7,17 January 2010,"The Lake House is a decent romantic drama from director Alejandro Agresti whose admirable in making this film which has some flaws but the good outweighs the bad. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are effective as the two leads. They both have nice chemistry with each other that made this film and Speed work for the most part. They don't share a whole lot of screen time together in this one but their scenes are well executed. The story is about an unusual lakeside home in which a lonesome doctor begins to exchange love letters with it's former resident, a talented architect. The only problem is she's in the year 2006 and he's in 2004. Yeah this movie uses a time travel device so you have to suspend your disbelief when watching it but The Lake House definitely wasn't the disaster I thought the film might be. Sandra Bullock is good as Kate Forster a lonely doctor looking for her one true love. Bullock continues to show her talent in this movie despite it's few flaws. Reeves is also solid as Alex Wyler a frustrated architect. Reeves gets a lot of bad rep for his acting abilities but I for one think he's a decent actor. He shows some emotion in this film and does what the role requires of him. Some of the characters lacked development because most of the focus is on Reeves and Bullock which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The pacing was a little slow at times but the movie is only 98 minutes so it doesn't go on forever like There Will Be Blood or Artificial Intelligence to name a few. The ending was a little predictable but a satisfying one. With it's flaws aside The Lake House is sure to please almost any couple looking for a good date movie. If you enjoyed The Notebook or Stardust than chances are you'll enjoy this one too. The Lake House has drama, some humor, and impressive performances by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock who make this romantic drama worth watching at least once.",The Lake House
88,Dunham16,An art film screened in the multiplex as a romance,8,2 November 2017,I recall the Chicago of the era with new friendships not easy to come by and very otherwise focused people accustomed to the nation's most forward looking urban architecture. I saw patients at the hospital in the film. There is a truth in the Chicago of the era as photographer and director see it. Neither Sandra Bullock nor Keanu Reeves knows the pace and feel of the art movie genre which weakens their performances. The movie would have garnered more recognition on the art film circuit than it did in the family circuit Hollywood multiplex. Real time warp and thoughts of those left behind following a death are its principal themes.,The Lake House
89,Jay_Exiomo,"Logic is thrown out, sparks fly, and slowly goes the pace",5,14 June 2006,"""The Lake House,"" a film by Alejandro Agresti and featuring the reunion of ""Speed"" stars Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, is the Hollywood version of the Korean film ""Il Mare."" I haven't seen the latter yet nor did it create much buzz here in this side of the world, but I'm quite familiar with the premise as it's supposedly the reference material of a Filipino movie also about two lovers separated by time that was released a few months ago.The film's premise seems both high-concept and art-house material. In a nutshell, Kate Forster (Bullock) leaves her house by the lake upon getting a job in a Chicago hospital. She leaves a note for the new tenant, which is received by Alex Burnham (Reeves), and he writes back to her. Through the succeeding correspondence via the mailbox, they realize they are communicating with each other despite being separated by two years.As I've said, I haven't had much idea about the original film so I can't judge ""The Lake House"" on whether it justifies its source. All I know is that its attempt to be a difference in its genre is successful to some extent when you consider the current influx of Hollywood adaptations of foreign productions.But personally, I think the pace of the movie really seems slow. I may not have seen ""Il Mare"" but I've seen other similar Korean films (like ""April Snow"") and know they tend to pad a lot on its running length and it gives the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to follow the style of the Asian original as much as it can, resorting to a few good expositions of the characters, only to cop out to a predictable third act and a contrived ending.Granted, the suspension of disbelief is done well, and even the most illogical time-space contortion of the movie is believable. It still manages to keep the paradox of its reality slightly abstract. But as it progresses, the latter parts just weigh down on the movie as a whole and it just seems as it becomes less effective than how the filmmakers would've wanted them to be. These parts are where the movie reminds us that ultimately, it's still Hollywood from its interpretation of the original, and that's where the film's nuance is lost and the slow build-up of the earlier part feels almost out of pace and a bit too slow.The acting is not so strong in the movie, yet the sparks between Reeves and Bullock is evidently there. And considering their roles wherein they are in love with the peripheral existence of each other, to say that it's commendable would perhaps be an understatement. Christopher Plummer also provides a brief yet solid appearance.The cinematography looks great, and again, I don't know if it has to do with the original but the elements are apparent. It's mostly warm and comforting, with the location and sets giving a feeling of nostalgia and a sense that there's a whole lot more to what lies on the surface.Personally I think the movie works if you're in an undemanding mood as it's a decent change of pace from the usual flicks that barrage the theaters this season (especially in America). Still, it underscores the plodding pace and the gradual decrease of subtlety throughout its progression and this really does keep it from being a couple of notches higher.""The Lake House"" has all the pieces on its arsenal. It just doesn't know how to fit them nicely enough.",The Lake House
90,gregeichelberger,"Dull, plot-less and pointless psychobabble",3,30 July 2012,"Originally published on June 13, 2006:This is ""Speed"" in reverse, as that film's two star meet in a weird, meandering time trip of a love story that is as pointless as it is plot-less; and is as dull as watching beige paint dry. It's like viewing George Clooney's ""Solaris,"" only with slightly better acting.Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) carries on a very long distance love affair with architect Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves). Long in that his reality is 2004, while hers is two years later. Don't ask how this is possible; they somehow just end up communicating through letters left in a mailbox at a lake front home in Chicago with a dog as the main medium of this communication.They even meet - twice - at a train station and at her birthday party. Of course, this is in 2004, and he knows her, but she doesn't know him - confusion, you're soaking in it. All the while the pacing is interminable.Movie is made even slower by having everyone speak in hushed tones and acting as if everything they say has the most profound importance - it isn't. The only one who raises his voice is Alex's bellicose father, played by Christopher Plummer (""The Insider"").In the end, however, for no reason whatsoever, Alex catches up with Kate. How this occurs is left to our imagination. And, it seems the whole enterprise was created to teach Alex how to properly cross a busy street. Other than that, most people left the screening as befuddled as I was.The main problem was that there's no explanation on any major plot points here, such as how the time jumble occurred in the first place, or especially, how Alex was able to catch up to Kate's current reality. Wouldn't he always remain two years behind? Things just take place and we're supposed to accept them with no questions asked. I'm not that stupid, though.Of course, now people will use the worn-out clichés that because I did not like the movie, I ""just didn't get it;"" or that I'm ""too shallow"" and cannot comprehend such a ""thoughtful, deep, moving"" motion picture; basically that whoever doesn't give this film a positive review is an idiot.

With all the elements typical from all the romance films, it has anything new to add and it has the problem of a very slow development of the film. All this make it a little boring, but is directed correctly and it is not too much sweety.

93,TheMovieMark,"Not without its shortcomings, but interesting all the same",7,16 June 2006,"""I don't get it,"" said one confused old man as he filed out of the theater.Listen up, folks; this movie is not that hard to understand. Take the time to wrap your brain around it and you shouldn't have a problem following along. However, after listening to people talk after the movie I realize that some of you may walk away a little confused. So let me hold your hand and reveal a few facts that you should grasp before seeing this: A) Sandra is corresponding from 2006, B) Keanu is corresponding from 2004, and C) These time periods aren't mutually exclusive. Sandra's character still exists in the 2004 time period that Keanu is communicating from and vice versa.Got that? Good. Sandra can tell Keanu where she was in 2004, and Keanu can cross her path, but the 2004 version of Sandra will have no clue who Keanu is. Makes sense, right? So the trick is that the 2006 version of Sandra has to figure out where the 2006 version of Keanu is so that they can meet in Keanu's future (AKA Sandra's present). Everything unfolds from there. Seriously, it's not that complicated.I think most of the confusion exists because the script isn't as tight as it needs to be. It's frustrating because the story could have been much better (and a few plot holes could have been easily eliminated) with a couple of more rewrites. The most frustrating thing to me, and I reveal this because it's best you know it upfront, is that we're never told what exactly is causing the time rift between them.We're expected to just accept it as fantasy and not demand any explanations. You'll enjoy the film much more if you understand that not all loose ends will be tied and you can ignore the plot holes I alluded to. I'd love to discuss them and explain my specific issues with them, but doing so would reveal way too much of the story. Email me after you see it and we'll discuss.Throwing those quibbles aside, I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. Perhaps I'm a sucker for romance movies that aren't scared to throw a little of Nick Drake's Pink Moon down on us, but I like that this is a romance that plays it a bit unconventionally. Is it for everybody? No. There's a lot of talking (though it never gets as gay and flowery as I feared), and some of you might find the pace slow. Though I felt it more deliberate.I also applaud the performances of Sandra and Keanu, who is nowhere near as robotic as you may expect. I actually bought into his emoting! Good job, Mr. Cool Breeze, but you really need to work on making your sneezes more believable.Fans of romance movies will adore the theme of love and how its power can change someone's life, but since I'm into more masculine topics, I preferred watching the pieces of the time puzzle fall into place. It reminded me a little bit of Frequency - Keanu does something in 2004 and then Sandra recognizes its impact in 2006. Then we follow along as they try to figure out how to meet.I wanted one of them to leave their hand in the mailbox and see if the other could see it when they went to retrieve the next letter. Perhaps a disembodied hand wiggling around in a mailbox wouldn't have fit with the mood that the writers were going for, but I would've laughed.Speaking of mood, I thought this was another strongpoint of the movie. The cinematography is great, creating a cold, atmospheric setting. Chicago's impressive architecture is used to great effect. If you like stunning visuals to set your romantic mood then you won't be disappointed.As long as you're willing to give this film your undivided attention for approximately 100 minutes (and you can easily forgive its shortcomings) then The Lake House will prove to be an intriguing piece of film for lovers of the romance genre.And hey, even if romances aren't your thing, there might just be enough mystery here to keep your interest. After the movie, my friend commented, ""As far as romances go, this is probably the best I've seen."" And he hated The Notebook, ladies.THE GIST The Lake House suffers from lapses in logic, unnecessary plot holes, and predictability, but I appreciated its attempt to add something fresh to the romance genre.

The only question then is simply will they or won't they. In other words, it's another take on the whole I fell in love with him/her without ever seeing him/her idea. Think ""You've got mail"".

But it's not awful either. The chemistry between Bullock and Reeves is believable, the cinematography is lush, and the dialogue is engaging enough. Sticklers will question the fudged logic of the film, such as how come no one really seems that surprised when the existence of time travel is suddenly revealed, or the multitude of paradoxes that are inevitable whenever you talk about time travel. My response is to say don't drive yourself nuts thinking about it. It's a romance flick, not a sci-fi feature. If you like romance you can suspend your disbelief and enjoy. If what you are really hankering for is the chance to pit your intelligence against the whole unbelievably convoluted concept of time travel rent ""Primer"", which is probably the best attempt I've seen at approaching the subject ""realistically"".

98,Rathko,A Reserved Success,7,26 June 2006,"'The Lake House' is a better-than-expected romance that revels in its quiet simplicity, though sometimes at the expense of depth and dramatic drive.The leads possess charisma and charm, and Reeves manages to step up beyond his usual mechanical persona. But then the story, despite its intentions, is really driven by the plot rather than the characters, and both Reeves and Bullock are not really expected to do anything beyond service the plot's twists, turns, and surprises. Plummer's role is woefully under-developed, with no explanation really offered as to why he is so cold and distant. Even on his death-bed, the character makes little attempt to address his flaws. Moss-Bachrach is terribly miscast, making a highly improbable sibling to Reeves. Aghdashloo, however, puts a unique and compelling twist on the generic 'best friend' role, reminding us just how rare it is to see an immigrant in a mainstream American movie who's ethnicity isn't a driving plot-point.There are some vaguely vacuous ramblings about the nature of home, and family, and belonging, but it's never particularly convincing. The Lake House itself is an unlikely architectural classic, and does little to convince us of Plummer's status as a premier architect. Not only is the thing several decades out-of-date stylistically (it's supposed to have been built around 1970), but constructed wholly of glass, it is completely unsuited to an Illinois lakeside where temperatures must vary between 100 degree summers and sub-zero winters. Considering that the characters have a particularly meaningful conversation about the need for great architecture to suit its surroundings, the design of the Lake House seems even more improbable.'The Lake House' is a satisfying romance, and though it never quite attains the level of depth and emotional honesty that it strives for, is rescued by a genuine sense of affection between its two leads and a suitably quiet and reserved pacing that at times approaches the lyrical.",The Lake House

The exchanging of letters is engaging and also gets a little tedious at times, but the story nevertheless keeps us yearning and interested to see how they end up. Whether the unorthodox and non-linear chronology confuses you or not, you will still buy into the romance, which is what this movie is all about. I walked out of the movie theater with my own interpretation of the film's logic in that Bullock's character created this fantasy in her mind. Whether her brief encounter with Reeves was their only meeting or not, by the end we feel they are meant for each other.

100,dhaufrect,The Lake House is a long one.,6,6 July 2006,"""The Lake House"" is a long one. It is not long in time, but rather gives the feel a lengthy film because of the extended pauses without much stage business that could keep the viewer busy in a visual sense. Sandra Bullock plays Kate Forster, an unassuming young and very beautiful woman who develops an emotional tie to Keanu Reeves who plays Alex Wyler. There is a two year difference between their relationships and that portion of the story becomes clearer as the story progresses as if one brings a magnifying glass closer to the screen. Christopher Plummer presents a very convincing portrayal of the domineering father of Alex and his brother, Henry. Plummer has a detached appearance which adds to his character in a way that only her is capable of radiating. There is a beautiful Lake House that is made almost entirely of glass, and it takes on a character of it's own. The wintry scenes are refreshing. The dog is charming, and the story remains puzzling, yet there is a love between two people that is worth viewing even by the most skeptical. It is a mature cinema, and one that is worth waiting for while the others go to the computer animated stuff that inundates our theaters. Dale Haufrect",The Lake House

They needn't bother, as your head will explode if you try to figure it out. They love each other, so what does it matter? I've given up on trying to figure out the logic in romantic comedies. They really should be called Romantic fantasies. Sleepless in Seattle, Kate and Leopold, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (my fav personally), all of which has some gap in logic that we have to glance over.Putting logic aside is only possible when the two actors involved have chemistry, and these duo does. They play Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves essentially, but they've gotten quite good at it over the years, and they each have a few touching moments in their slow steady relationship. Keanu does not appear as hollow as he usually does. Christopher Plummer is also in the movie, but mostly as window dressing.

103,merrywood,An engaging love story,8,21 June 2006,"""Love,"" the philosopher-metaphysicians tell us, ""is the adhesive of creation, the motive force and the very source of all form."" Thus it's no surprise to see it continuously played out in dramas from ancient Greece on into the fantasies of today's high tech cinema where the nature of time itself plays only a second role to it. The Lake House is such a film. Love transcending time is not new to dramatic imaginings or even to film. The earliest I know about was John Balderston's play converted to the screen, Berkeley Square (1933), with Leslie Howard where the lead character manages to travel back to the 18th Century to find the woman of his dreams. This lovely film was remade in 1951 as I'll Never Forget You with Tyrone Power. Then in 1980 we had Somewhere in Time written by famed occult writer, Richard Matheson from his novel and starring the late Christopher Reeve.By coincidence, Keanu Reeves, often wooden in past outings, plays the lead in The Lake House in one of the best performances of his that I have seen. Here, the protagonist is but two years apart in time from the woman with whom he falls in love. The script exhibits some beautiful writing in segments and is well performed by all. It's marred, however, by some logical continuity bungling but overall its effect is coherent enough to be acceptable primarily due to the chemistry and convincing performances of the two lead players, Keanu and Sandra Bullock. It's a beautifully filmed production, oddly enough in Chicago and environs offering some bright shots of the city where many of us have thought of or remembered it (as in my case) as gray and murky.

Alex receives a letter from the former tenant asking him to forward her mail to her new address in Chicago should the postal service fail, and she apologies for the dog's prints on the floor and box of stuff in the attic. Alex finds no dog prints or box in the attic but he does begin a correspondence with Kate which changes lives because Alex lives in 2004 and Kate in 2006. This subtle clue is followed by others including the situation that unlike modern professionals, Kate and Alex do not email nor seem to own a computer, a clue that this story is not the typical boy meets girl. And there is a traffic accident on the first day of Kate's new job and she aids a man who has been hit by a bus who later dies in her arms. It too is a clue that foreshadows what is to come in a convoluted story that transcends the ideas of time and space as scientific, empirical, and measurable.Thoroughly believable are the mature actors Reeves and Bullock, a couple with enormous screen charisma. Long ago women noticed the boyish Keanu's great leading man looks and waited for him to mature into a handsome, sensitive, and older man. This fact is never more enjoyable than this film which provides both actors with great solo moments of on screen time. Sandra Bullock has lost her girl next door cuteness replaced with a face that is mature and enormously attractive, not beautiful, but interesting to see as life unravels around her despite a successful medical career. Both personalities have tremendous believability and their give and take echos the brief snips of the ultimate screen lovers, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman from Hitchcock's Suspicion, and in literature with Jane Austen's Persuasion. This is screen chemistry at its best. Th elegant Christopher Plummer is Keanu's cold, brilliant and distant architect father, who the son comes to grieve by elevating the design of his father's glass house into a home for Kate.

The two spark a relationship through the crack of time itself and communicate through letters. ""Lake House"" is quite original and ingenious in filling in all the plot holes. I'll admit at times I did not understand it all and I like that. I'm glad I got just the gist of it so I could get that sense of wonder. ""Lake House"" is highly recommended and is one of the years best movies",The Lake House
107,jasminn_tan,Love Me Some Angst!,8,1 December 2019,"I recently rewatched this and I absolutely enjoyed it. I guess you can call this a time-travel movie? I'm not sure but the concept of this movie was well executed and anyone who says this isn't plausible is just being unnecessarily boring. It's a movie! Anything can happen in a movie.Whomever thought of reuniting Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock was a genius because these two have great chemistry that translates really well through the screen. Not only that, I liked the multiple layers that their characters possessed which made this better than a typical romance movie.",The Lake House
108,eastbergholt2002,Depressing,4,20 June 2006,"The Lake House is not a romantic comedy. It's about an unhappy couple who find true love before they actually meet in person. I found it slow and depressing and if you are feeling suicidal or in need of a good laugh this is not the movie for you. However, opinions seem to vary depending on gender. My wife enjoyed the film and recommended it to friends.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock play characters that appear to have everything going for them, they are attractive, well educated, successful and affluent. However they are both unhappy thirtysomethings. Bullock is a gloomy doctor who has never been in love. Reeves plays an architect who is sad because he believes his father didn't really love him. Reeves and Bullock are tenants of the beautiful eponymous Lake House. Because of some cosmic mystery that isn't explained, they live two years apart but are able to communicate by letter. It's like You've Got Mail in the Twilight Zone but without the comedic touches. Reeves and Bullock form a bond, share a dog and relate to each others pain. This is the kind of movie where nobody does anything tacky like exchange lottery numbers or racing tips. Unfortunately being depressed, all the time, makes you lonely but in true Hollywood style it all ends happily. Given all the misery in the world it's difficult to understand why a supreme being would alter time to bring these two self-absorbed individuals together. Bullock is good at comedy so I don't understand why she wants to play taciturn women who don't smile. Keanu was his usual wooden self.",The Lake House
109,CCsito,A blend of time travel and alternate reality,8,23 June 2020,"I am sure this movie will raise a ton of ""huh?"" and plot holes. Anachronisms galore. Notwithstanding all of these ""defects"", the movie's premise seems similar to the Christopher Reeve/Jane Seymour movie titled ""Somewhere in Time"", but instead of meeting directly, a mailbox becomes the time machine for them. I am not going to pick apart the plot of the movie and show all of the inconsistencies. There are only two major plot holes that I have a concern with. The first one is when a man is hit by a bus on the city streets. Kate who went to offer aid apparently never realizes that the injured man who dies is the same man who kissed her on her birthday two years earlier. Was that incident from the birthday party that forgettable? Maybe so. The second one is where Alex decides to follow what transpired in the ""Persuasion"" novel by not pushing to meet the doctor on Valentines Day 2006 and to wait until ""the time and place is right"". He still does not appear at the restaurant for their scheduled meeting on Valentine's day night 2006. Why not since he did not get hit by the bus? For this ""plot hole"", I can accept the alternate reality explanation. He was originally killed on Valentines Day 2006 and by preventing his death (following a different future path), he must accept the destined path that he must wait until the correct date and location has arrived. And that date is Valentines Day 2008 and the place would be the location that allowed the time travel connection in the first place - the Lake house. Kate needed to realize how Alex had crossed paths with her and to finally confess her love for him. Doing so would not occur until Valentines Day 2008 and meeting earlier would likely end up with ""the wrong place at the wrong time"" result. Timing and location are crucial factors in many relationships.",The Lake House

A highly imaginative story is slightly confusing at times and I suspect that physicists would come up with numerous reasons why this could never happen. Nevertheless, it made compelling viewing (although, as far as I'm concerned, anything with Sandra Bullock in it is compelling viewing - she is the most beautiful person I can think of!) and it IS categorised as fantasy genre (although not sci- fi).I'm still trying to get my head around why Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock) didn't get it together at her birthday party bearing in mind that Kate was already in love with Alex, even though she didn't know who he was.

113,Robert_Hearth,"""One Man I Can Never Meet. Him, I Would Like To Give My Whole Heart To."" --- Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock)",9,13 November 2006,"""The Lake House"" (2006) Directed By: Alejandro Agresti Starring: Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Dylan Walsh, & Christopher Plummer MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for some language and a disturbing image)I hadn't heard much about ""The Lake House"" prior to my viewing of it, except that it was a romantic drama that brought Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (both from ""Speed"") back together. Now, I don't know about you, but I have always thought that ""Speed"" was an insanely-entertaining thriller and that Reeves and Bullock have always had exceptional chemistry together. So, I was intrigued by the idea of seeing the two paired up in a romance---it seemed like a sure thing. And, by all means, it is. ""The Lake House"" is an intelligent and deeply elegant movie that does not settle for mere simplicity. It wants to keep its audiences interested and wants to keep them thinking. For that, it is highly effective. Much like a well-rounded mystery, ""The Lake House"" presents evidence throughout its duration, most of which is simply ignored by the audience due to its assumed lack of significance at the time, and then, at the very end, it brings all of the evidence back together to form a suspenseful ending.Kate Forster (Bullock) is a woman who lives in a glass house positioned on stilts above a lake just north of Chicago. She decides to move to an apartment in Chicago so that she may become a doctor at the local hospital. As she moves, she leaves a letter for the next tenant--who just happens to be Alex Wyler (Reeves). Upon reading the note, Alex is immediately confused and writes a response that tells Kate that she must be speaking of the wrong houseas no one has lived in the lake house for years. The two begin to write each other back and forth, leaving each letter in the mailbox outside of the lake house--until they finally realize that they are living on the same date, two years apart. The two form an amazing bond of lovebut how can they be together when time has pulled them apart? The plot is, of course (as all time-bending plots are), quite confusing. This is not your conventional romance. It is not a light and breezy movie. It requires its audience to think. While some may not like this, I find it to be quite refreshing--a twist to the genre, if you will, is almost always needed at some point or the other and ""The Lake House"" provides such a twist.The performances in ""The Lake House"" are quite good with the highlight being Sandra Bullock. Last year, Bullock blew me away with her emotional performance in the phenomenal ""Crash"". While some people still doubt her talents, I find her to be a great actress. Here, she just drew me in with her vulnerability. I related more to her character. Keanu Reeves, who is often mocked for his lack of emotion, delivered exactly what was needed of him here. While not the most dynamic actor, he never lacks credibility herefor me, at least. Shohreh Aghdashloo is such a beautiful actress to me and is quickly proving her talent. After her role in ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (which was limited), I didn't expect her to show up again. But, here she is! Maybe it is just her raspy voice or possibly just my interest in the pronunciation of her name, but she always wins me over. There is no difference here. Christopher Plummer is one of the best actors of our time, if I do say so myself. I can't get enough of the guy! I am so glad to see a romantic drama that doesn't use the same old moments to bring emotions out of its audience (i.e. death of a character, etc.). It is an engaging movie and, though not perfect, it is one of the best romances I have seen recently. Speaking of the film not being perfect, ""The Lake House"" does require a little too much suspension of belief on the part of the audience and there are a few plot holes (that I will not detail, as that would require me to give away a large twist). The ending also seems to be a little too sudden and, though I was content with it, I desired a little bit more of an impact. But, overall, ""The Lake House"" is a wonderful movie that almost completely won me over with its impressive performances and a direction that shows many unusual and intriguing concepts (I really enjoyed the spinning door segment). It provides a much-needed twist to the romantic drama genre.Final Thought: Thought-provoking and beautiful, ""The Lake House"" is a mesmerizing achievement in film-making.Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)",The Lake House

It's a personal love story between Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock), but I'm warning you, this is not just a 'run of the mill' romantic tale. They're both subjected to a long distance relationship, only communicating through letters. There's a deep connection to each other, but love has to take a back seat in this one for a certain stretch of time. This movie Is a fun watch with tears until the end.

115,sinncross,Second chances for all...,8,28 July 2006,"Love is perhaps the most important and as equally complicated emotion which is embodied in us all. Would you think it possible to love someone who you had never met, and who lived 2 years apart from yourself? That's the question The Lake House attempts to answer, with some very pleasing results.The Lake house tells the story of two individuals, who begin to contact one another by means of letter writing, and discover that both live in the same city, only 2 years apart. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) writes letters which move through time to the past, where Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) returns the gesture back to the future, or present, depending on your outlook. Both lead completely different lives, with Kate being a doctor, and Alex being an architect, but both share a connection: The lake house, but more importantly, they both yearn for companionship. It all sounds as if it comes straight out of a science-fiction, with a little romance added for extra flavour, however, for the best, this is not the case. The Lake House, first and foremost, is a romantic drama. There is no explanation for how both are able to contact one another, but that's never the point. We get sucked into this relationship and may find it credible because it easily represents long distance relationships, and the complications they hold. However for many, the premise seems implausible, yet one must understand that the time difference scenario, is based upon the predestination paradox, and since such a notion cannot be proved or ever dismissed, one cannot say the story for The Lake House is not possible, especially since the relationship is just a mere metaphor.Reeves and Bullock do great jobs of portraying believable characters. Their chemistry is touching, even more so when one considers that they communicate through letters, and not eye-to-eye conversation. As all romance's, you can't help but want to see both lovers eventually end up with one another: the ending will surely leave a tear in your eye. The best aspect of The Lake House is that you'll feel a better person after the experience.The Lake House never reaches the emotional potency you would hope it would, but that's partly because the characters are never able to bond physically, only spiritually. While Kate and Alex make a connection which is truly thrilling to watch it's not enough to make for a compelling love story. Nonetheless, The Lake House has virtually no mishaps in its execution, and is easy to recommend to all, especially those lovebirds among us.",The Lake House
116,lopcar1993,"Touching and overwhelmingly beautiful, I truly enjoyed this film",8,11 August 2009,"We see romance flicks so often today that sometimes we don't bother to look for the underlining layers that define them, bad romances just use cheap sex scenes and sexual dialogue to past the time so that you won't be lost in the horrible script and bad acting. Good romances on the other hand have unshakable romantic stories that touch the heart and uplift he soul, they have acting that almost renders you speechless and an unimaginably great script and story that you just love. ""The Lake House"" has all the qualities of a great romantic drama and so much more.This supernatural love story is something of a stand alone in the modern romance genre it follows protocol down to almost every layer of Romance. But somewhere along the line it takes a really long detour down the path of unique and mind blowing. This film is nothing short of brilliant and remarkable I haven't enjoyed a good Romantic drama since ""Titanic"" and ""Rome + Juliet"", this film was extremely entertaining, very sweet and movingly touching to the point that your almost in tears. This movie has the makings of greatness but it's mired down by the people calling it clique, predictable, unoriginal and unmoving.But I'm sorry this film doesn't have cliques, it's unpredictable, it's very original, and it's extremely moving. It resonates with the heart and with the soul on a whole new level, it makes you feel great and gives you that sense of love and enjoyment that you've been searching for in a romantic drama. It's so beautiful and so touching that you just can't ignore the romantic freshness that resonates from this film as you watch the story unfold right in front of you, It's story and plot are so warm and gentle and I loved every single minute of it. And if your forgiving and open your mind and look past everything you see today and look at this film with fresh eyes and a born again sense of love and happiness, than I can promise you this film will conquer.All in all this film delivers a very romantic, very touching and very unique love story that just happens to transcend time itself. The Lake House delivers.",The Lake House
117,petit76,extraordinary performance from Bullock and Reeves..,9,29 August 2006,i found nothing in this movie to implement debunks.Keanu Reeves and Bullock have generated a great chemistry between and this made the story quite palpable.The director of the movie made a great selection of these two people in the movie and even the co-players were quite competent and nothing really distracted me from the plot.Considering the timely iffies a preconceived viewer would file out of the theater believing the movie has no consistency inside .I watched the Lake House movie without succumbing any rumors or previews and this really helped me watch the movie comfortably enough.Suspension of disbelief is quite a great phenomenon for the human beings and neglecting the illogical time-travel issues one can easily find a great response to his/her solitude.The movie is quite implausible for viewers who really want every single thing on earth to have a logical order but this movie quite plausible in terms of suspension of the disbelief.I heard laughters in some part of the movie and these laughters lessened and ovations started after some people preferred negligence of the logical facts to taking things seriously.Sometimesdisbelieving something may make an issue quite comprehensive . I rate this movie 9 out of 10 and it is worth watching .Enjoy it.,The Lake House
118,Critical Eye UK,Great packaging. Empty contents.,5,21 November 2007,"So OK, 'The Lake House' is harmless nonsense from start to finish.Regardless of all the amiable drivel propounded by ""time-line compilers"" obsessed with subjective / objective realities, its tale of two people whose travel through life is irrevocably separated by a distance of two years is no different to a tale of two satellites whose orbital progress is irrevocably separated by a distance of two miles.The individuals cannot stop time so as to be simultaneously in the same place any more than the satellites can stop their orbit so as to be simultaneously in the same place.Ignore time-lines then, because otherwise you'll never reconcile the ending with any kind of reality: Mr Reeves goes lonely and love-lorn about his everyday life from 2006 to 2008 in order to be with Ms Bullock in 2008, except in the intervening two years Ms Bullock has gone lonely and love-lorn from 2008 into 2010. . .Which means that instead of the pair of them getting together, all Mr Reeves can now do is wait until 2010 by which time Ms Bullock is in 2012, so it's necessary to hang on until 2012 by which time Ms Bullock is. . . Bit like pi really. On and on and on.) Better, instead, to focus on what the movie's all about: The Magical Mailbox Wormhole By The Lake.Which it is. And which the movie should've been called.On which basis, Mr Reeves' early faith in its remarkable properties is fully justified: hardly has the movie gotten underway, he's not only collecting his mail from it, he's posting mail to others inside it.Still later, or earlier, depending on what you think the movie thinks a clock actually is, The Magical Mailbox Wormhole By The Lake indulges in happy transmutation, and turns that which only exists in the recipient's future into tangible substance within the recipient's present.Ah, wonderful. If only we in the UK had such a postal service. All ours can do is take stuff from the past and make it vanish in the present.Banging on, then, about the plausibility of 'The Lake House' is about as sensible as banging on about the plausibility of 'Brief Encounter': the relationship couldn't happen.Yet given that this complete absence of credibility is a major self-imposed stumbling block, the movie actually does pretty well.Yes, it's utterly impossible to care about the characters because it's utterly impossible to believe in them.But -- and this is, after all, a movie -- 'The Lake House' is by no means impossible to watch.Bullock and Reeves aren't asked to do overmuch, but what they do is highly effective, particularly in a lengthy one-shot, one-take scene where the playing off each other is handled with considerable finesse, and which alone makes the price of DVD rental worth paying.Plaudits, too, to the director and DoP: it's beautifully shot, and laced with some delicious visual felicities (notably a sequence where Reeves in one year sits on a bench, Bullock on the same day two years' hence sits on a neighbouring bench, and people are transformed by age and Fate as they track across each different reality.) The script is competent, too, though not especially adroit: whatever subplot was ever intended by the story of Ms Bullock's mother is never articulated, so the screen time devoted to it is a complete waste.Obviously, it was there to resonate with the subplot involving Mr Reeves' father, but that has as much plausibility as the movie's grasp of the space / time continuum. Still, Mr Plummer is on fine form, even if he appears to have come into 'The Lake House' from a remake of 'The Fountainhead' that won't be made until, er, two years from now.Finally, there's the soundtrack. It's lovely.Lovely in the sense of a last bow tied around some beautiful packaging.Which, really, is what 'The Lake House' is: an empty box, but with a wrapping so attractive there's certainly no harm in toying with it for a while.Opening it, however, so as to analyse its content, is recommended only to those who admire the Emperor's new clothes.",The Lake House
119,irish23,Exquisite; perfect for actors with limitations,9,22 December 2006,"I can't believe I liked a movie starring Keanu Reeves.Worse, I can't believe I loved it.""The Lake House"" is a quiet, contemplative piece, slowly weaving us into its spell. Suspend disbelief and just let it unfold. Like classic drama, the question of fate is persistent throughout the film and strikes a deep chord that we can escape unpleasant destinies and have hope.Bullock and Reeves were very good in their roles; however, since seeing the revelation of Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" I've come to believe that these quiet, thoughtful films are perfect for actors with limited range. Neither Reeves nor Bullock is memorable as an actor in general, but this type of film allows the story to transcend their limits. One wonders how much more depth would've been displayed had truly gifted actors had these roles.I'd just seen ""The Upside of Anger"" and there's a scene with Joan Allen where she collapses to the ground sobbing -- almost exactly the same as Bullock in ""The Lake House."" Allen's performance, even though we only see her from the back, was somehow far more dramatically compelling. Regardless, the complexities of ""The Lake House"" story and the underlying question of ""Will they ever connect in real-time? Is this really love or just a passing fancy?"" kept me riveted. I do wish Keanu Reeves would stop trying to sound intelligent. He often pushes his speaking voice lower than natural, adding a slightly strained quality. Having had the misfortune of seeing him interviewed a few times, I surmised it was because he is forever running from the ""Bill & Ted"" mantle and feels that he has to fight to be taken seriously. Give it up, Keanu -- just be real, give it your best shot, and accept that you're no Bogart! It's okay. More vehicles like ""The Lake House"" would allow the less-talented-yet-box-office-bonanza actors like Reeves to gain a little more street cred.",The Lake House

So too, in films there's love-belief-science, in which all three of these compete to account for what happens in a film. And in this one, love triumphs over belief (in time travel) and over science (explaining the time travel) and that's what makes this a great movie. Suspension of disbelief seems too complicated to me, but the love in this story, a great script, and the acting by Reeves and Bullock, who really seemed to believe in one another, the love won out. It's just like believing in life after death when there is no proof, but generations keep on doing it over the millennia no matter how much belief is demanding or how much science keeps fraying it at the edges. The whole movie was about the love the conquers us, the audience, and as paper covers rock, so love covers belief and science.",The Lake House

It's like watching George Clooney's ""Solaris,"" only with slightly better acting.Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) carries on a very long distance love affair with architect Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves). Long in that his reality is 2004, while hers is two years later. Don't ask how this is possible; they somehow just end up communicating through letters left in a mailbox at a lake front home in Chicago.They even meet - twice - at a train station and at her birthday party. Of course, this is in 2004, and he knows her, but she doesn't know him. All the while the pacing is interminable.Movie is made even slower by having everyone speak in hushed tones and acting as if everything they say has the most profound importance. The only one who raises his voice is Alex's bellicose father, played by Christopher Plummer (""The Insider"").In the end, however, for no reason whatsoever, Alex catches up with Kate. How this occurs is left to our imagination. And, it seems the whole enterprise was created to teach Alex how to properly cross a busy street. Other than that, most people left the screening as befuddled as I was.The main problem was that there's no explanation on any major plot points here, such as how the time jumble occurred in the first place, or especially, how Alex was able to catch up to Kate's current reality. Wouldn't he always remain two years behind? Things just take place and we're supposed to take them for granted.Of course, now people will use the worn-out clichés that we ""just didn't get it;"" or that we're ""too shallow"" and cannot comprehend such a ""thoughtful, deep, moving"" motion picture; basically that whoever doesn't like this movie is an idiot.

123,RecoWilliams,A Very Romantic Movie,8,26 June 2006,"As all of my theatre students know I am not a big fan of Keanu Reeves. I think his style of acting is so one dimensional. That's why he worked out so great in The Matrix, Speed, and Johnny Nnemonic.But with all of that being said! Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have a great on screen chemistry. There is a new depth to Keanu Reeves that I didn't know he was capable of. He played a distraught love sick man really well.I also love this movie pick for Sandra Bullock. She has made it no secret that she doesn't want to do Romantic Comedies anymore so she has been choosing roles to stretch herself as an actress. She was absolutely genius in ""Crash"". In Lake House you see a range of emotions from Sandra that you only get to see at the end of most of her movies.So to the review the movie is a really good date movie. The story follows the lives of two lovers who live two years apart. There is an event that triggered their meeting, but I don't want to ruin the movie for you.When you go to this movie allow yourself to be suspended in disbelief and forget all of the trailers you watch and just let the movie unfold before your eyes.This was like watching a piece of artwork being developed before your eyes. The imagery in this movie is stunning.I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Sandra Bullock may have just earned herself a well deserved Oscar nomination with this performance.

The plot in simplistic terms is this: A doctor (Bullock) living in 2006, manages to correspond and fall in love with, an architect (Reeves), by virtue of a magical mail box. None to promising, I know but the script nearly makes it work! Nearly. The problem is that there is always something to slow the momentum of the film. To drag it into the mud. That is not to say there aren't high points, I liked the supporting work from Plummer as Reeves' conceited father and Aghdashloo as Bullock's mentor. Sadly, they are slightly underdeveloped. Plus there's is one scene that I absolutely adored involving a McCartney song entitled: ""This Never Happened Before"".

126,Rozinda,Simply wonderful,10,15 October 2009,"What a simply gorgeous movie. After seeing The Proposal which I loved, I checked out Sandra Bullock on this website, and was intrigued by this story. I was lucky to find a DVD of this movie only a few days later in the local supermarket so I bought it unseen and it's now one of my favourite movies.Spoilers......... this gives away the plot completely, don't read unless you have seen the movie or really want to know the ending before you do!!!Early on when the guy was killed in the road accident, I thought, but that's... However, the story rushes on with Bullock and her colleague talking of the effort Bullock's character made to save this accident victim without success, and somehow I didn't think again about the accident, I didn't complete my thought, not even when he doesn't turn up at the tryst though clearly something was very wrong. I assumed he'd lost interest in her, good thing I did or I might have been feeling frantic right from the start that the ending was going to be utter tragedy, not only from when she realises..... which is much later.........When you're told he was the accident victim, how can this story end except in tears and despair for the heroine? Yet the timeslip - the letter box that is a time machine - saves him. There are little paradoxes - he meets her ""in his time"" before she has left her first letter for him, but he doesn't tell her. She even falls for him then and kisses him, but still he doesn't tell her. She looks back at the station and sees him with her book and doesn't remember this later even though she had suggested he could go to the station and find the book she inadvertently left there. She spends time trying to save his life at the scene of the accident, but doesn't recognise him although she's met him before. It seems the timeslip is preventing her recognising him until the time is right for them to be together. Because this is such an unusual movie, I didn't find any of this ""amnesia"" at all strange. It's an interesting intellectual puzzle to work out how this story could be true, that he is saved.... I guess it has to be parallel universes, one of the many theories about time and space. One choice we've seen earlier that leads to the hero's death is rejected by him because once the heroine knows who was killed, she warns him just in time.... and makes him wait for two years instead of walking out into the road when he sees her. In the first universe, he can't wait, in the second he does wait. But if there are parallel universes, somewhere out there, he could in yet another miss both and still be alive and his beloved might be dead. Paradoxes of time and space, fascinating but disturbing - if we lived consciously in all those universes surely we'd go mad?Don't miss this movie!I hope to see the original Korean movie, Il Mare, sometime.",The Lake House
127,LadyLiberty,The Lake House Sinks Under Its Own Potential,4,18 June 2006,"The titular lake house is a modern architectural gem. Made mostly of glass and poised atop stilts at the edge of a lake, it represents the peace and tranquility long sought by the woman who rents it, Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock). It's thus with deep regret that she is moving to an apartment in the heart of Chicago to make the commute to her new job an easier one. On her way out the door for the last time, she leaves a note for the next tenant in the mailbox expressing the hope they enjoy the house and that they'll kindly forward any of her mail.The catch is that the ""next"" tenant turns out to be the previous tenant, architect Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves). He moves into the lake house to find Kate's note waiting for him. He's confused by her mention of things about the house that apparently don't exist; he also wonders at her carelessness in mistaking the date for sometime in 2006. He writes back to her with a brief note of his own which, two years in the future, Kate finds just as puzzling.Meanwhile, Kate does her best to get up to speed on her new job. Dr. Anna Klyczynski (Shoreh Aghdashloo) is her mentor and, as it turns out, enough of a friend to suggest she take a break now and again to get entirely away from the hospital and even the city. Kate typically uses her brief time off to return to the lake house which, in her time, is still empty. But the mailbox usually has a note from the past in it, and she becomes more and more eager to read each of them and to respond herself.Two years in the past, Alex designs condominiums. That's something his ambitious younger brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) views with a certain amount of incredulity given the grandiose plans the two had as children; his father, the famous architect Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer) makes little secret of his outright disgust with both of his sons. Alex works hard to gain at least some acknowledgment from his estranged father, but the elder Wyler is largely uncooperative. Alex, though, does have one bright spot in his life, and that's his growing feelings for Kate.Kate and Alex, who are both alone in their respective times, find comfort and eventually deep feelings in their letters to each other. But with two years separating them, their emotions are frustrated at best. It's obvious that the two will have to arrange some way to meet, but fate and their own lives keep getting in the way and confusing matters even more than they already are. Eventually, both begin to wonder if there's any hope at all, either for their own happiness or for the chance to try to share their lives.Sandra Bullock is often too perky for her own good (though it suits her in many of her movies). She's somewhat toned down here, and does a good job conveying the melancholy of a successful but very lonely woman. Keanu Reeves, who is too often emotionless (again, something that suits many of his characters) is surprising here, particularly in one scene where his display of grief is wrenching. The fact that the two still have the chemistry together they exhibited in their previous effort together (the very successful Speed) also helps. The supporting cast, while certainly adequate (and better than that in the case of Plummer's performance) is almost incidental as the movie rests almost entirely on the shoulders of its two stars.Director Alejandro Agresti has a lengthy résumé, but the vast majority of his previous efforts have been foreign in origin. That may or may not have proved helpful to him as he worked on this American adaptation of an Asian film. It certainly had some effect on the choices he made where dramatic edits are concerned, and as far as American audiences go appeared to me to have diluted some impact. More creative editing might have lent itself well to enhancing the parallel but time-separated lives at the heart of the story, and the simplicity of the plot otherwise could have used the help.Writer David Auburn has the critically acclaimed Proof behind him, but his inexperience shows in the script here. While there are certainly no explanations of the time slip strictly necessary, there are other holes in the plot line that might have been better filled, and there are moments of such unreality that your necessary suspension of belief is strained to the limits.On the whole, The Lake House isn't a truly bad movie. Its poignant plot will touch your heart provided you can let go of some of the more jarring inconsistencies in the film. But that it could have been quite a bit better makes the movie almost sadder in the lack of fulfilling its potential than in its admittedly touching story.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Lake House is rated PG for ""some language and a disturbing image."" Young children aren't going to understand or appreciate a romantic story at all let alone one involving the complication of an apparently time traveling mailbox. The language isn't so rough, though, or anything else so inappropriate, that the average 12 year-old couldn't see the movie if he or she (frankly, far more likely she) is so inclined. How much you'll enjoy the film yourself depends almost entirely on how much you're willing to let its stars carry it for you. For me, the actors could only take it so far.",The Lake House
128,jehaccess6,Plot Holes Keep Dragging Me Back To Reality.,6,27 October 2008,"I enjoyed this film in spots. Keanu and Sandra are both very likable and lonely characters that have never been really content with their innermost lives. This being a romantic movie, it is a safe bet that the two main characters will get together before the closing credits. It is just that such glaring holes in the plot keep poking me in the eye and breaking the story flow.I don't even mess much with the mail box, except to wonder if the postman ever appears and noticing the raised red flag picks up the mail intended for Alex or Kate? Does Alex even get any regular mail from that box? Did Kate experience anything spooky about the mailbox not related to Alex?Next, consider Jack the dog. How does Jack know when and where to appear and disappear? She (Jack) shows up out of nowhere and Alex (Keanu Reeves) kindly adopts her instead of calling the pound; which would have put quite a crimp in the plot. Later, Jack runs off from Alex and somehow knows to appear at Morgan's law office, just after Alex has turned over the keys to the Lake House to Morgan.Then there is the lake house itself. Supposedly there is an attic room there to hold the mysterious box. Looking at the house from the outside, there is nowhere in that roof where there is space enough for an attic. Later, Alex complains to brother Henry that there is no way to have contact with the lake from the house. Well, there is a landing platform under the house with a ladder leading down from the main floor. That platform is clearly visible in several external shots of the house. Finally, Alex clearly mentions that he has purchased the Lake house. He then turns over the keys to the house to Morgan. Does this mean that he has given away the property to Morgan and Kate? Or do the two lovebirds live in the lake house rent free? Or maybe Kate is mailing rent checks to Alex?Then there is Kate's luxury apartment building. Kate misses the lake house trees and Alex travels to the construction site to plant a tree that suddenly sprouts in a formerly bare courtyard in the future where Kate is living. The painted image on the construction wall showing the future apartment building's appearance clearly shows several trees in the courtyard. Alex's tree was planted well before construction was finished and landscaping begun. His tree would have not survived a week of being in the way and an architect would know this. Kate finds her missing book under a loose floorboard in her apartment. To get that book there, Alex would have to get into the building under construction and cut out the floorboard in the proper apartment to deposit her book. Then, Alex would have to hope that Kate would happen to find the book. Better to just place it in the mailbox.Then there is the obvious concept of placing photographs of each other in the mailbox to allow the correspondents to know what the other looked like. Somehow, that never occurred to the separated lovers.Finally, Kate treated Morgan horribly. She never really loved him and broke off their relationship. Then, she renews their relationship only to dump Morgan again without a second thought. Kate was really cruel to a man who probably loved her as much as Alex loved her. What fate would Alex face if Kate met someone else she liked better?On a subsequent viewing of this film, it dawned on me that the closing scenes were totally illogical. In the Alex time line, he has moved out of the Lake House and turned over the keys to Morgan. Yet he can race back to the house Kate has moved out of and access the box that lay undisturbed in the attic to confirm that Kate will be at Daly Plaza on that day. Kate knows about the box and presumably would have opened the box and read the letters she wrote to Alex from the future. Then the whole delay in getting together would be shortened to days.Well, the two lovebirds got together at the end. They really don't know each other that well. Will reality be far less enchanting than their dreams? I don't expect a sequel to fill us in.",The Lake House
129,botrytis,An Oddly Fascinating Platonic Love Story...,7,11 November 2011,"First of all, we shall state that where two unique actors, like Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, are playin', star together, it can't be and even couldn't be bad, and even couldn't be found a sign of lack of ""awsomeness"". They're great actors, and somehow - how we have already seen in movie ""Speed""- They fit together, They amend, complete each other, and they seem to be sensitively supportive.Now, this movie ""Lake House"" has wonderful story, which is exactly impossible, but that's the magic of it, the fact, that's can not be even explained, the movie has it's own reality, and we don't even want to bother to compare with our one, coz it's seems to be something, which would be nice if it could be exist, especially today. It's a story about two person, who didn't find the true love so far in their lives, but one day something has been discovered, a miracle, which made a butterfly effect. Interesting huh? If you don't get it, just watch this movie, you're not gonna regret it, I guarantee that. The whole plot goes up in each minute, the mystery become revealed, and what's gonna be in the end?...Anyway, If I could, but I can't give for this product an exact point, the IMDb rating system don't allow that, so, I'm gonna write it here, which is 7.6 PS: I Hope, Sandy and Keany're gonna star together in more movies.

130,darkmax,A variation Of Il Mare... (may contain a few spoilers),6,28 July 2006,"I went in thinking that this would be a Hollywood-ized remake of Il Mare. I wasn't disappointed.I think the original has more emotions and attention on the two lead. It actually made me feel sad when I realized he died trying to help her get back with her boyfriend. I also much prefer the Korean version's female lead. She more capable of making me feel her emotions, her confusions.As for the male lead, Keanu is without question the better one.I did not like this Hollywood version because I think it is... well... stale. The attention to the depths of the characters and their emotions are simply lacking, if at all it exist. This version is more story telling than the interaction between the 2 main characters.However, some of the scenes do have very serene backgrounds to contrast the lives the 2 characters lead.BTW Il Mare meant the sea..... and since this is an adaptation, why exactly is it on a lake?",The Lake House

This movie was almost perfect for the development of the plot, every piece of the puzzle fit. Other than that, the story flowed well, the acting was good, and the ending was adequate.

In my experience, romance is a pipe dream and there's no point wasting time on silly movies about pipe dreams. I watched it after flipping through On Demand films and finding nothing else even mildly interesting. It was a ""desperation"" selection. That I liked (no, loved) this movie so much leaves me speechless. There's no reason why I should have. After all, it's a completely implausible sappy love story. Two people separated in time, falling in love through letters left in a magic mailbox ... I should have run from the room screaming. Instead, I've seen the film four times. The only reason I can give is that the performances by Reeves and Bullock transcend the schlocky material and touch me. Their on screen chemistry (yes, they do have a few scenes together despite their characters living in different times) turns what should have been a laughably bad film into one with real heart at its center.",The Lake House

135,RobinCook70,Frustrating,3,30 September 2006,"I rented the DVD and watched this movie the other day. Again, I knew nothing about it to influence me.What did I LIKE about this movie? I liked the unique storyline premise of two people writing letters and falling in love separated by two years, but that's as far as it went for me.I have trouble with both Bullock and Reeves in films. But, to combine both of them as leads in a film? At least Reeves actually did good acting in this film. Bullock seemed she was reading lines too much and her character was not believable. She was not the right actress to cast in this unique storyline. Bad casting for this movie, but I do feel Reeves was appropriately cast for his role .., but I sensed even he struggled to get through to the end of the film.I really struggled to continue watching this film to the end and found I was exhausted ... and then frustrated with the ending. It's like they decided to quickly write an ending and do a quick dump job to simply get the movie done and get ticket sales.I love good romance films. In this movie, if Reeves and Bullock were supposed to be in love, I didn't detect a love connection between them. In the scenes they were together it was like they had no real feelings for each other than just having fun writing letters and have the flag pop up and down on their mailboxes.Perhaps this movie appeals more to the youngsters of our society, but think even they are intelligent enough to grasp that even with intentionally blocking out one's logic brain centers to view this film, this movie simply does not track. Bad casting, bad scriptwriting .. great story premise, that's it. Oh, at least they did a good job with the art on the DVD jacket and disc ... after all, how else could they manage to market it without a good visual package. And no, I didn't even bother to look at the special features on the DVD (if there were any), since I popped it out of my DVD player and back in the jacket quickly.So, if you don't have anything else good to watch, you might give this one a try as long as you don't have any expectations of understanding or liking it when done.",The Lake House
136,eckhouse24,"Lake House good, but not great",6,29 June 2006,"The Lake House The Lake House is not a film about time travel like some may think. It's a story about waiting...which is what two people will have to do if they want to be with each other.Sandra Bullock is moving out of the Lake House. She is lonely, and we can assume that she is somewhat sad. She leaves a letter behind in the mail box for the the new person moving in and leaves for Chicago.Keanu Reeves moves into the Lake House and finds this letter. The catch, he is actually two years behind her. Bullock is living in 2006, Reeves is living in 2004 and the mailbox serves as some kind of time paradox for these two to communicate. That they do and they begin to fall in love with each other through their written words.The movie works on several levels because this is a universe where their friends accept what is going on with these two characters. They don't question the possibility which makes it more believable for the viewers. Also, Keanu and Sandra have great chemistry together as proved with their on screen romance with the 94 blockbuster, Speed.It also works because as mentioned earlier, this is a film about two people waiting for love, a story about time, not time travel. I did enjoy the movie but I was disappointed about it's ending but that is probably because I chose to think rather then accept. So for me, I give this film **1/2 out of ****!",The Lake House

138,mjarvis0,I liked it!!! A LOT!!!!,9,15 January 2007,"I started watching this film quite late one evening and perhaps that is why it took me a bit of time to figure out the central theme. At first I thought it was one of those double booking romances where both find that they have rented the same place but now have to share etc etc. Once I figured out that there was an inkling of sci-fi to this movie I then wondered how they were going to get together. And then while waiting for this to happen I suddenly had a bad feeling about the bus crash scene. So I paused the DVD logged onto the internet and hit the IMDb site because I thought that if this movie was going in the direction I thought it was going I would stop watching immediately. You see by then I was well and truly gripped and willing a happy ending and I would not watch anymore if it was not to be so. And that is what a movie should do! A horror movie must scare you. A comedy must make you laugh. And a romantic movie must have a happy ending. And the lake house does. I love this movie and I will be owning it on DVD very soon. I have loved Sandra Bullock ever since I saw speed and Keanu is the ultimate action hero but this movie shows that he can apply his talents to anything. There are probably sci-fi boffins that will find various holes in the time differential and on another day I might have been one of them. But this movie is too good, just enjoy it and have a little weep when everything comes good.",The Lake House
139,spooly_montana,Affecting Romantic Drama,9,13 November 2006,"Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are back with their dynamic chemistry in THE LAKE HOUSE. The film revolves around a rather unusual glass house built on stilts set in a lake outside of Chicago, Illinois. Kate Forster (Bullock) moves out of the house in the spring of 2006, into an apartment in Chicago, where she is starting her career as a doctor. Before she leaves, she drops an envelope with a forwarding address to whoever will occupy the house next. The mailbox is located right out in front of the path to the bridge, which leads to the house's door. She checks back sometime later to see if she has any mail, and finds a letter from a man, Alex Wyler (Reeves), who claims he is living in the house at that very moment! The date he writes on his letter to her says 2004, and Kate leaves a snide reply note mentioning (among other things) the wrong date. Through their odd correspondence, sent and received from this same mailbox nearby the lake house, it comes out that Alex is living in the year 2004, exactly 2 years to the day back from when Kate is living! They both have their own reasons for being lonely and through this mailbox, in ways unexplained, they are able to reach out and feel that special connection with another person, that is so needed and lacking in their own lives. Alex is an architect, who has a true passion for the warmth of a home's design, rather than just its functionality or original design. Alex's father, Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer), is proud and defiant as his health wanes, and as his son tries to get closer to him in these final days of his own life. Christopher Plummer gives a very noteworthy performance as the brash, arrogant ""Architect of the Year"" award recipient, who belittles Alex's views on architectural development, while hiding from him the fact that he envies his ability to create a home, rather than just a house, in his building senses. Kate enjoys helping people, in her role as doctor, and after her last failed relationship has kept quite a distance from men. Alex and Kate forge a strong bond, but have to find a way to bridge this gap between them, before it is too late and their love is lost forever! Keanu acts very well in this film, and complimented by Sandra, they give solid depth and breadth to their characters, enabling you to accept the implausible storyline, with refreshingly sincere acting from both of them. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock first starred together in a movie about a speeding bus wired with a bomb that would not allow it to drop below 50 mph. Of course that was 'Speed,' and it's hard to believe that was released over a decade ago, back in 1994. The blockbuster film was not only a critical success, but impressed audiences with its thrilling plot and tangible chemistry shared by the two stars. The film's sequel 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' bombed, due for the most part to the lack of Keanu Reeves being in the film. Reeves and Bullock have an incredible, almost magic presence that they create together on screen. David Auburn pens a terrific screenplay that is both far fetched, but beautifully believable in how the lovers from different times are cleverly intertwined. Auburn also wrote the terrific play 'Proof', which he adapted for the film version that starred Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins. While Keanu Reeves has starred with many fine female leads, including Cameron Diaz, Carrie-Anne Moss, Charlize Theron and Winona Ryder, none of those pairings can compare to the explosively memorable pairing he had with Sandra Bullock in 'Speed' and that we are fortunate enough to witness again in 'The Lake House.' I truly feel they are one of modern cinemas most enigmatic on screen male-female couples. This is the most unique and affecting romantic drama to come out in a very long time, in a class all its own. The Lake House is rated PG.",The Lake House

The only let down was the ending. Jack should have been included as he was an integral part of their individual lives, their first contact and their eventual meeting.

A  Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically  expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland  gave that award to this film.  An attractive, educated, professionally fulfilled Doctor (Sandra  Bullock) ""meets"" an attractive, educated, sensitive architect (Keanu  Reeves) via letters and a past common residency of a particular lake  house. What could be the problem? The problem is that they are  currently living two years apart and then again at the exact same time  in this romantic, heart-wrenching, dramatic fairy tale.  The Doctor leaves the lake house in rural Illinois in 2006 in order to  advance her career and find happiness in Chicago. She leaves a note to  an unknown-to-her new tenant, the architect, to forward her mail. They  correspond to each other and slowly discover that he is actually living  in the house 2 years earlier in 2004. And  they share the same dog.  But somehow the viewer can suspend disbelief and get into the story  because the two characters are believable and intelligent and are  initially just as skeptical of the time riddle as the viewer.  Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock re-unite for the first time since  ""Speed."" The genre of ""The Lake House"" is completely different, but the  actors are just as complementary and likable in this fantasy tale. They  both display a deep, patient, and profound love for each other. And  they do so with grace and charm and a chemistry that can't be readily  explained.  Much of this film plays like a mystery with mothers and fathers,  siblings, and boy and girl friends weaving in and out of the story in  the present time of 2004 and the present time of 2006. But through it  all, the Doctor and the architect ultimately never lose hope that they  can solve this time puzzle and can actually be together at the same  moment in time.

Now they're writing love notes in Chicago, the barrier of time be damned.Bullock plays Kate Forester, a new resident at a busy Chicago hospital, who has to move out of the titular lake house to be closer to work. She leaves a note in the mailbox for the new tenant, which is picked up by Reeves' Alex Wyler. But here's the catch. For Alex it's April 2004. For Kate, it's April 2006. The two continue to exchange letters, and form an odd love affair. How is this possible? How does Wyler explain the situation to Forester before she becomes cognizant of it in her own timeline? I've long been a fan of fiction centered on time travel, or the bending of the fabric of time. I think it's interesting how they work in all the intricacies of it. This film kind of took liberties with that, to their credit, but unfortunately didn't always make it work. There were some instances where the couple changes the past or future because of the letters, like the tree growing in front of Kate's apartment building. But then they concede that time may be cyclical, i.e. the concept of fate and what not. Not to consistent with its theories, and that thing, above all else, bugged me.It was fun to see these two together again, as they had an undeniable chemistry in Speed. Reeves, however, needs to stick to action films. While fun to watch on screen, he is by no means a great actor. He's barely any good, without being downright bad. Constantine exemplified this by providing us with the most unintentionally funny lines of dialogue I've ever heard. He's a bit stiff in The Lake House, though does provide a better reading of his lines. And since I don't really expect much of out Reeves, he can impress me with even a minimal amount of work.Bullock returns to the ""chick flick"" genre that has brought her fame and fortune during the course of her career. And it seems to be where she's most comfortable. Bullock appears to love romantic films, and slips into her various characters with the greatest of ease. But it by no means implies that she phones in her performance.What shines for me is Alejandro Agresti's direction. His meticulousness (despite the conflicting time travel theories) attention to detail and subtle visual clues (of which there are many) make this a beautifully realized film. While I'm still trying to figure out the mechanics of how that gorram mailbox worked, you don't really care as you're watching the film, it's like an afterthought.",The Lake House

However, if you can suspend your disbelief, you may very well enjoy this well-directed (if talky) movie. This is certainly one of the least offensive time-bending pics I have seen. It's obvious that this film was not directed by an American, but it also wasn't directed by a hotshot show-off artsy type either. Although the dialogue is a little weak, the other elements (performances, setting, music especially) are noticeably above average. I was dragged to this movie by a friend, was bored in the beginning but wound up rather liking it in spite of myself. The film creates a unique and specific downbeat mood which I rather enjoyed, and takes its time getting to where it aims to go. I found myself growing to like the characters and their world. I also was surprised that at a couple of points in the film, I really felt I couldn't assume how it would end. That is almost unheard of for an American film these days.

Yes, it sounds far-fetched, and both characters don't seem surprised at the circumstance that they are in regarding their time-space separation. However, the soulful and touching performances that both actors give made me forget the potential laughability of the plot. The scenery is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, and the story flows well.Spoiler The scene where Bullock realizes that she has to prevent Reeves from meeting her and she sends him a letter warning him of his imminent death is one of the most heartbreakingly touching scenes I have seen in recent cinema.

148,dcheng-7,Contradicting its own logic.,3,12 October 2007,"There are queries I like to share with viewers.There is the problem that Kate and Alex are separated by 2 years in term of time dimension. That means even if Alex can reach Kate before 2006, it would be useless because Kate had not started knowing and loving him.But on the other hand, there is no reason why Kate cannot locate Alex in 2006(her present time) with all the information and that will be meaningful because Alex would have already knew and loved Kate. Why is she not doing that? OK, how the hell would they expect that the 2006 Kate will be able to meet the 2004 Alex through the appointment at ll Mare when they are separated by time of 2 years? This could never happen and they should not have attempted this impossibility.That's because when 2004 Alex reaches 2006, the 2006 Kate will be in 2008.In 2006,he will only be able to meet the then 2004 Kate who does not know Alex.By the same reason , the two should not be able to meet at the end because when the 2006 Alex, escaped from death through Kate's message and waited for 2 more years till 2008, the ""then 2006 Kate"" would then be in 2010, still separated from Alex by 2 years unless something happened to break the spell! And in 2008, Kate will not be at the lake house to wait for Alex because he had not died and Kate would not have told by Alex's brother about his death that had led Kate to the lake house in 2008! Probably she will be told by Alex's brother his whereabout at the architect's office, or Alex would have contacted Kate long before at any time between 2006 and 2008.All these contradictory points and twists( and many others actually) had downgraded the film into an unexplainable absurdity, and the only attractions that had led me to finish the film are the actor and actress that I both like.Another good example that Hollywood films are no longer respecting reasoning and simple logic, not even logic defined by the film itself.",The Lake House

"" ""Why don't they send e-mails, pictures, etc"" ""what's with all this time-travel BS? "" and so on and so forth. OK, so this movie is no Oscar material. so what ? it wasn't intended to be in the first place. it's a touching story about loneliness, introversion, search for one's true self, true love, second chances... and the handwritten letters are something that defines the characters. they are not business people, not over-pragmatic, not interested only in instant gratification. Both characters are portraited as romantic in a nice old-fashioned way, looking for personal touch, for soul-mates, for that ""something"" that nowadays is , unfortunately, forgotten. this relationship has nothing to do with messenger or google or SMS. it's a connection between two souls, not wireless instant communication. the timelines aren't too clear, I agree, but that makes the intriguing quality of the movie. nothing is served on a silver platter, we have to think, to figure it out, to try to understand...and finally to let go of logic and follow our intuition . it's not easy. and the movie definitely needs to be seen at least twice, to get it right.",The Lake House

Kuana Reeves and Sandra Bullock are two people who fall in love while living in the same Lake House....The imaginative part is that they live two years apart and some how can still communicate.First off this is a interesting concept....Something semi new....a impossible in real life love story, but still it works if you try not to work it out. So if you see the movie, just turn off your brain and enjoy the movie.Kuana Reeves and Sandra Bullock are two very good actors. Reuniting for the first time since 'Speed' and they still have very good chemistry together. They show emotion great, and it is definitely touching.The scenery is okay, but at times, quite damp. The Lake House itself is pretty ugly I think, and there really wasn't very much beautiful scenery....More....depressing....or everyday stuff.....They should have gotten a better house, and showed more of the area.Overall the movie was okay, if you do not think during it.

While many men fantasize about Angelina Jolie or Paris Hilton, I find Sandra Bullock to be my idea of a beautiful woman.Anyway, this movie is full of holes that if you try to apply logic to it, it will fall apart. The key to this one is that the two lead characters played by Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reaves are so likable that you find yourself rooting for them to somehow get together no matter how improbable the love story. I admit that I am a sucker for a good romance and I really enjoyed this one. If you just let yourself be taken along for the ride with out questioning the large holes in the logic, you will enjoy this movie. And I might add that this is the first time I have seen Keanu Reaves not play a ""dude"", or flawed antihero. He plays a real adult in this one and I enjoyed both his and Sandra's work in this one.",The Lake House

158,lilballa08,Ouch!,1,31 August 2006,"Political correctness is not something I usually expect to see in a Keanu Reeves flick, and there's none to be found in The Lake House. But the filmmakers would like you to think there's some in there, and that, in a way, actually hinders what could have been a really powerful movie.This is especially counter-productive in The Lake House because it is the very thing the director claims to be satirizing. The movie lacks the sophistication of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD or Stanley Kubrick's CLOCKWORK ORANGE, two similar movies which tackle their social commentary with wit and style.This director, smacks you over the head with a bludgeon, making his points so obviously and self-righteously that they go right out the window, and the movie winds up being little more than a freakshow of eye-popping special effects and nauseating scenes of Keanu weeping in turtle necks.The romance in The Lake House is especially offensive, more so than any other of this odd subgenre. In When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle, one can make an attempt to condone the romance only because it appears to be committed by jungle dwelling people as part of their natural routine. One cannot make the same excuse for The Lake House.But if you're looking for outlandish cheese and barfer moments, look no further than The Lake House. It's definitely a must-see for any self-loathing middle aged woman. Everyone else should steer way, way clear.It was obviously an inspiration for both The Departed and The Winter of Frankie Machine.",The Lake House
159,sshogben,An Unexpectedly Haunting & Beautiful Film . . .,10,21 June 2006,"There IS a quality to ""The Lake House"" that lingers in the mind days afterward.For a film in which the element of Time is uniquely important, ""The Lake House"" manages to convey an odd sense of universal timelessness. It is as though the specific When is less relevant than the universality of human thought, feeling, and decision. An almost mystical quality.""The Lake House"" is that rare film which not only invites but welcomes a repeat viewing. The first time simply follow What happens in the story. See the film again to more fully enjoy How this story elegantly unfolds.This is NOT a time travel film. Repeat, NOT. Each character in this film experiences only his or her own natural time moving forward in the usual linear chronological way. What changes is each character's perspective on what they are experiencing over time, and how each's perception of their Past informs Present decisions which impact Future events.If I had to pick one theme to describe this picture: at the time they occur, we may not even recognize the most important encounters or events in our lives.Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock) are two seemingly unconnected persons who have lived in the lake house of the title - exactly two years apart. Through seeming accident they find that they can communicate with each other directly, in immediate personally experienced time, through the mysterious mailbox at the lake house. We then follow the often startling events each experiences - and writes about to the other - over the next two years of their lives, Alex from February of 2004 to 2006, Kate from February 2006 to 2008. The result is . . . an extraordinary film that both satisfies the intellect and engages on a surprisingly emotional level.Their roles here are a significant departure from usual for both Reeves and Bullock, but not to worry. Individually, this is either's best work anywhere. Collectively, their chemistry is exceptional. Subplots in the story are developed through some superb supporting performances, most notably the two parents. Christopher Plummer is achingly brilliant as Alex' demanding genius architect father, and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy positively oozes wit and warmth as Kate's mother.The lake house itself . . . physically brings out so much emotional subtext in this film that it ought to be credited as a separate character. (If no artist/architect has actually built this house, they should!)Altogether, ""The Lake House"" is one of most rewarding films of any type I have seen in many years.HIGHLY recommended.",The Lake House
160,za-andres,A Dreamy piece of crap,1,12 March 2007,"After reading the New York Times review of ""The Lake House"", I had a craving for this ""....wondrously illogical time-travel romance."" Let me explain in one fragment about this movie: Trash, Trash, Trash, Trash and more Trash.What makes ""The Lake House"" so bad, is that almost every aspect of film making has been thrown out the window, except for its little ooh-a-time-love-story- based-on-a-Taiwanese-movie-plot.And that enough, is one reason not to see it.The acting from Reeves and Bullock never creates any friction, nor does IT give the audience a marvel to look at. The could have acted 30 times better, yet impulse, (Mostly from Reeves) makes the acting very trashy.The script seems to be recycled from an old love story, and in some parts i had to cover my ears because it was so daft and desolate. And from the execution of the actors, it makes it seem even worse.This movie is a tortuously slow dud that will make many frustrated ticket buyers wanna go postal.Don't see it.",The Lake House

I won't give a description, I'll tell you the feeling. We all seem to want what we can't have. For a love to grow, to a point of obvious discover, only to find that you can't reach out and touch it only intensifies the wanting. The ""time travel"" in this picture is well done, in my opinion. Not that it follows every rule, but that it makes the movie. Reeves and Bullock are great together, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The lead up to the end in wonderful and spoke to my heart the strength of the love that slowly grew throughout this movie between two, not total, strangers. Enjoy it with someone you love, or want to.",The Lake House
162,mrsknoll,Touching,9,29 September 2006,"I really enjoyed this film. As I've gotten a bit older, I've come to appreciate sentimentality in films and ""The Lake House"" is a sentimental film. It moves slowly at times, but you grow to care for the characters over that time, so that you long for the ending to come to find out if they were ever given the chance to meet. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have a well-matched chemistry, as they did in ""Speed."" Typically, Keanu is not my favorite actor - he's always a little bit ""Bill & Ted"" to me. However, this role suits him and his acting ability. Sandra is the girl-next-door and can play a woman in love better than anyone. While watching ""Lake House,"" you can feel the connection between them - it has the familiarity of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and then ""You've Got Mail."" There is little to no comedy in this movie, which, surprisingly, fit it well. I expected it to be a more soft-hearted film than it was but greatly appreciated it for what it was. It's difficult to say much about the film without leaving spoilers, but I will say that any woman who appreciates the ""chick flick"" genre will enjoy ""Lake House."" Women who know what it's like to feel as though you will never find the man that fills your heart with joy and lifts you off your feet just by walking into the room will feel at home in this movie. Keanu plays that man well in ""Lake House."" Sandra ignites a memory in my mind of the time before I met my husband and wondered if he was out there. I watched this movie and felt her sadness. My husband appreciated the movie for what it was, but I'll be honest, he's a one-in-a-million man who would do so.To sum it up, ""Lake House"" is a sweet, soft movie that touched my heart with a memory of longing and sweet sadness - I would recommend it to women who enjoy love stories of tender proportions.",The Lake House

I agree that both have had some dodgy performances in the past and some of the acting was still a bit clunky here (hence my score of only 8), but this one scores.It makes a pleasant change for Keanu from his gung-ho roles. Sandra Bullock is very believable (and the better actor in this film)I wont spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it, and it does have some interesting twists in the plot. perhaps you will see these coming - perhaps not!Yes it is corny, but still brought a tear to my eye at the end.

164,todd-ramirez,Awful!,1,21 September 2006,"OK. I'm a fan of both Bullock and Reeves. I'm a fan of romantic movies. I read and heard a lot of good things about this film. So it was with high excitement, anticipation and openness that I approached it.What a downer! Twist? What twist? It was predictable all the way through.The dialog was horrible, the plot implausible, and the story corny and just plain not believable.""Sorry, but my brother died two years ago."" Yuck! ""Dad built the house because he was controlling."" Argh! Speaking of dialog: initially Alex and Kate communicate thru the letters, but I guess the writers decided this would be too tedious so they make them do voice-overs instead. Eventually, they talk like they're having casual chats face-to-face, as in a verbal dialog. Yet the audience must still assume that they are still communicating thru letters. And one simply cannot fit the ideas in the conversations in written letter format. Maybe in internet instant messaging, yes, but that would have been too cute. But it worked in You've Got Mail, because YGM explained it: Meg Ryan's character once said, ""I like to start my letter as if we're already in the middle of a conversation."" TLH couldn't pull this off and it annoyed me to no end.I also tried but couldn't buy Sandra Bullock as a doctor. At least in this film, I couldn't. Notice her administering the electric shock. She looked totally awkward, no leverage, and you knew she was trying her darnedest to act like a doctor.About the time travel aspect of it, come on. Can the filmmakers insult our intelligence more? I can't for the life of me fathom how anyone can buy it. In order to buy the storyline, one needs to suspend all logic. People even say that. ""Don't try to understand it. Just enjoy it as a romantic movie."" What?! Don't try to understand it? Now here's time travel for you: they put the same Paul MacCartney song twice in the movie! And it was the worst song ever from Sir Paul. I guess we know the answer to the question in ""When I'm 64."" I tried but failed to sympathize with any of the characters. You find yourself not caring for any of them. When the dad died, you can't sympathize with Alex's - or Kate's - grief. Or when Alex himself gets killed. Then not killed. You just want to see how in the world the filmmakers will reconcile the two. And they fail miserably in doing so.I tried but failed to feel romantic. Heck, I couldn't even like the dog! Take for example the kiss. I was unconvinced. When he said, ""I love her."" I didn't believe him, and in the story, from his facial expression, neither did his brother. I also could not see how the conversation at the steps of the house could have been romantic enough to lead to Kate asking Alex to dance.I can only say TLH was worth seeing once, if only to know that I won't waste 97 precious minutes again. I generally consider 97 minutes short for a movie, for a story line like TLH's, I couldn't wait for the credits. Remember how Titanic so gripped you you didn't notice three hours go by? I'm sure glad I downloaded the movie and burned it on DVD. I would have been really unhappy dishing out $10 in the theater and twice that for popcorn and drinks and be this disappointed at a highly-touted film.I'll give it 2/10 for the two songs by Rosemary Clooney.",The Lake House

167,TruthSpeaks,Snore,3,17 June 2006,"Someone literally feel asleep and was snoring in the theater where I saw this movie. When the movie was over, the audience was like, that's it? That's all you've got?I'm literary. I'm civilized. I'm a chick and I like ""chick flicks"" if they have any merit. I liked the premise of The Lake House, but the execution was anemic and dull. The story is that two people separated in time fall in love when a magic mailbox allows them to exchange letters. They occupy the same lake house two years apart. There's a subplot involving one character's father. He is supposed to be this grand old man who, surprise, doesn't know how to love. We've never seen that one before. He makes grand pronouncements that sound like a stupid person's idea of what a great artist would say.That same dullness carries through the rest of the script. This is also the umpteenth movie to feature the city of Chicago and its architectural charms. That's getting old. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock don't have that much chemistry. I find Sandra Bullock irritating. She's not that attractive, but she is relentlessly perky and confident, and in a lot of movies, most of them bad. She's helped produce some of them, including Hope Floats, another bad movie. I wonder if she had something to do with this poorly-written movie getting made. There's just a time to say no to bad scripts and star vanity.If you want to pass the time, this movie is not unpleasant. It's not offensive. There is some pretty scenery at the aforementioned Lake House and around Chi-town. Some will find the stars pleasant to look at. I don't recall any swearing, nudity, sex, or misogyny. It's just draggy and soporific. Unless you are desperate to get out of the house, this is a good one to check out when it comes on TV, IF you wish to do so.I saw Sandra Bullock promoting this movie on David Letterman. She was engaging, told a good story, and carried herself with an appealing confidence. Is this how movies like this get made--someone makes an impressive personal appearance at meetings and then, bam, another poorly written script is foisted upon us? Does it matter that people don't want to sit through the resultant movie for ninety minutes? How about we look extra hard at the next proposed Sandra Bullock vehicle? Hope Floats, The Lake House, Miss Congeniality; there's got to be better material out there and other actors to consider. I was the intended audience for this movie, but I expected a lot more than I got.I've noticed that an amazing number of people here have given this movie rave reviews. I find that suspicious. Supposedly 50.5% of the people who saw this movie gave it a 10 out of 10. No possible way. That vote is rigged. Not just me, but whole audience in the theater where I saw this found it soporific. I've also noticed that three out of four people managed to find this review ""not useful."" If you're here to promote the movie, I'm sure it isn't. If you get rooked into seeing this movie, most theaters will give you your money back if you leave in the first part of it. Some will give you fifteen minutes and some thirty minutes into the actual movie, or stay and ""love"" this romantic snorefest.Update: On June 19th 2006, Jay Leno mentioned ""The Lake House"" in his monologue and people in the audience spontaneously groaned and booed.",The Lake House

169,ArArArchStanton,GREAT!!! for a love story.,7,3 July 2006,"I give it a 7. It was a decidedly good movie, just not one in a genre that I usually watch. It's a love story, and so I dock it a point for that. It's not a classic by any means and so I dock it a point for that. Also there are some weird subtleties that I don't particularly like. For all of it's wisdom there is no explanation at all for how the letters are able to traverse time. That's probably the most obvious. Also I'm not really sure how reeves was dumb enough to get run over by a bus just before he finally met the girl he'd waited for, for 2 years. So I dock it another point for those minor points, and well I guess just because it's a love story. yeah I know that's 2 points for love, but that's what I'm giving it. Ordinarily I'd give a love story a 5 as a ceiling score so consider that it actually received 2 bonus points. Not bad ehh? It scores high with it's symbolism. The highlight of the movie was the climax at the end, where the girl tries desperately to save his life, when she realizes that she's ignored the only important detail of the story. It was a fantastic ending.The telling portion of the story though came when keanu was talking with his brother on the roof and explained to him the symbolism of the house itself. How it doesn't relate to nature in the fact that you can't access the outside invironment in anyway. No stairs leading to the water, no windows to open. It's just glass, and while you can view all that's going on around you, you can't touch it, or sense it in any other way. For those unexperienced with what architecture really is, that is it. What does a building mean, and those lines in the movie explained it well.Still, there's no explanation as to how the building, while it relates to the deterioration of keanu's family life, relates to his newest relationship with his future girl. I suppose the solitude of the structure allows him the opportunity for introspection, and that introspetion allows each of them to focus on what they really want, which turns out to be each other, but an explanation would have been nice.You have to love the dog.",The Lake House

It's really shown me what Sandra Bullock can do too. The only reason I knew that she existed was originally because of Speed which I watched some time ago (it was brilliant by the way - I recommend it to all thriller lovers) and now after watching The Lake House, I have to say she's a brilliant actor.

It isn't until after Sandra Bullock's character Kate finds out of the dates being off by 2 years that things start to fall into place. From that moment on forward, the movie starts to get more interesting leaving the viewer impatient to find out more, and how things will evolve.Even though they don't have much screen time together, the chemistry between Bullock and Reeves is enjoyable to see at least. I really liked seeing them both in a movie after all these years. Willeke van Amelrooy was great to see as well in this movie, although her role as Kate's mother didn't have much screen time. I don't think most people here on IMDb don't know her, but in Holland I believe she's a greatly respected actress.THE LAKE HOUSE is a fun movie to see, being different from any other romantic movies. Even though it's based on an Asian movie. I believe this picture is especially fun when you try to see the 'hidden' meaning of each scene. The restaurant scene for example, which was complete torture for Kate. The time passing by were visualized very well.For it's genre, I give it an 8/10 for being different from the rest, interesting story, good acting, etc. Surely it's not perfect, but if you're open to it you'll like it a lot.",The Lake House
173,acts2120,Chemistry that cooks,9,18 July 2006,"The only reason I didn't give this movie a ten was because of the GLARING holes and inconsistencies in the whole time-differential thing (which I can't give away because it would be a spoiler). But I thought the intricacy of the writing, the dialog (most of it, anyway) and the character development was very enjoyable. But what absolutely, positively, undeniably works for me is the chemistry between Reeves and Bullock. As long-distance 'lovers' (and that's taking the term very, very loosely), they write letters to one another that are so heart-felt, so sweet, and yet weren't sappy. Aware of the time separation, there is a sense of reserved hesitation on her part, and a sense of hopeful abandon on his, which balances nicely with the story line and the eventual character development. I CARED for these characters!!! I wanted both of them so badly to find happiness, to feel 'connected' to someone else. That was a undertone that resonated throughout the movie, perhaps overly strongly for me - but certainly is a poignant aspect in this world of instant messaging where we exchange information but not talk, and not necessarily connect. These two people both had professions that necessitated being connected to something (he, an architect, to his projects; and she, a doctor, to her patients), but both of them seemed to be missing some elements of attachment. But when they find one another, suddenly they are connected, perhaps for the first time in their adult lives - and yet they cannot reach one another. Sob, sob!! And Keeanu actually acts!!! His scenes with Christopher Plummer, who plays his father, were excellent, and I thought very subtly done. Visually, the movie was fun, too. they had some wonderful scenes that were 'time-relative,' visually encompassing both time zones. There could be a lot in this film about which to complain - the time issue has some holes in it - but if a person can set aside their need for logic and let their heart take a meander down romance road for a little while, this film is a definite feel good romance!",The Lake House

It does take some concentration to follow closely, but don't over think it. It was engaging and never boring, not too simple and not too complicated either. I enjoyed the anticipation that the characters were feeling. I loved the lake house itself and learning how it got there. This is just an all around feel-good movie about two people who want to connect and after watching it twice, yet years apart, I could watch it again.",The Lake House

I really believe more love stories need to be told, so that the jaded can believe again. Love is real. Love is powerful. Love is everything. The performances are sincere enough, and oddly, Keanu pulls it off, though a scene with his brother is slightly awkward. I believe both of them in their presentation of distant lovers. They seemed genuine even though the performances weren't ground breaking. I'm not complaining about contrived coincidence. You have to suspend disbelief in theses types of charming movies. My quixotic nature lends me wanting to believe everything they give you, and I think you will too.",The Lake House

Pairing with Keanu Reeves perhaps is the best thing she could ever do, this couple really own the screen and I believe in the next twenty or thirty years, they will be considered one of the most great couple on screen, albeit they just did two films together.I will watch this again and again and I'm looking forward for her to do more films with Keanu Reeves.Lovely film, don't try to analyze too much, this is fantasy after all...",The Lake House
178,nicnik6,Time Is Just a Detail,10,22 February 2014,"When I first saw The Lake House I didn't understand it. I just watched along because of the actors, who are so good, despite my frustration at the fact that something was slipping through my fingers, that I can't quite catch it... Even so, there were moments in the film that gave me the goose bumps, at which point my frustration intensified beyond understanding, for how could I feel like that without actually getting the meaning? Anyway, I left the film for years.When I saw The Lake House the second time I set out from the very beginning that I would endeavour to pay more attention to as many details as I could in order not to lose track of the events again. The more I was realizing that at least part of the plot was impossible, the more convinced I felt that it can be virtually (and actually)possible. Paradoxically possible. It was also when I decided to rate it 10 stars out of ten.When I saw The Lake House for the third time (very soon after my second view) I saw it pencil in hand writing down facts and dates and stopping the recording to make sure I hadn't got it wrong, in an attempt to prove to myself and the world that it IS possible. It was also then that I decided to read what other people thought about it, both critics and amateurs, and was thrilled to see how many viewers had enjoyed the film.When I saw the Lake House the fourth time I was playing it for my teenage students as a Valentine's Day's surprise, with a short introductory warning not to expect logic, chronological plot or anything of the kind, and advising them to pay attention to details, what the characters wear, their surroundings, etc., and also urging them to be patient if they felt they didn't get it and renounce for the moment any attempt at it, but instead let themselves swamped into the strong romantic impulse this film conveys.Now, if you like romance, go see The Lake House! If you want a challenge, try it! If you like Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves together, don't miss it! If you only like one of them, don't miss it! And if you think Keanu is a versatile courageous actor, please do watch it! You won't be disappointed. But above all, don't be tricked by time. ""Time is just a detail.""",The Lake House
179,TheMara61,about The Lake House,10,11 December 2010,"It is my privilege to write about this fascinating movie. About love, there are hundreds and hundreds of movies. About ""The Lake House"", we speak not only about live and love, but about trust defying the time. We always want that our true love to despite time. Beauty is not timeless, and we all females cares about how one's looks in the eyes of the loved one. And our loved ones say that's all right, we turn into grandmas. Yet, each of us really tries to keep the unkept, the beauty. Those two in ""The Lake House"" are timeless lovers. As for the artists, Sandra and Keannu used to give us the best of their soul."" In the end, I'm just a man like you"", that is the finale in one's Eminem songs. I'm sorry, but in the end, Keannu and Sandra are not meant to be people like us. That is the charm of the movie, they talk about love, but they are aliens, far from the most dedicated love I have seen in my mind. The screenplay, the whole movie is nothing real. But they leave a space so we can dream about. And in my opinion, Keannu and Sandra saved the movie from a soap opera.",The Lake House
180,Boreas74,The worst film ever made?,1,29 June 2006,"This is a truly awful film.I can only assume that it went through a lot of hands before it hit the screen, the plot is turgid in the extreme and the writers clearly never even thought about the implications of having someone in the present change their own past.Even by the low standards of a Hollywood ""romcom"" this is a really bad movie.Keanu reaches a new level of wooden, only to be surpassed by the actor playing his brother.I haven't seen the original Korean movie but I hope it's better than this poofest.I can't understand how this is getting such a high rating on IMDb.If I was feeling charitable I'd say it does have quite a good soundtrack.",The Lake House

The movie is set in Chicago and shows off the city's incredible architecture without becoming a travelogue. Character development is clever and believable so that the movie does not bog down into becoming just another sappy love story. The musical score adds to the overall satisfaction so much so that at times it goes unnoticed - it blends that well with what is going on visually. One has to wonder why a film of this quality was released during the summer when we expect a plethora of action films and romantic fluff. This movie could well be remembered for Oscar consideration this fall. This is a movie I would recommend to my friends without hesitation.",The Lake House

I hate to divulge too much & spoil it for those who have not seen it yet but... yes there is a time travel aspect that you need to be on board for if you're gonna enjoy this flight of a love story/fantasy. You may also need to actually have made some lifelong choices & experienced some life, loss, and love, to connect to it. I totally understand why these major movie stars picked this script when they surely have a pile to pick from. BTW Christopher Plummer has a small role but his speech about architecture was very moving. One other thing...if that dancing/kiss scene doesn't get to you...my most sincere regrets to you and your loved one.",The Lake House
183,GeneR777,"Okay, I liked it a lot. Worth the price of admission",8,19 June 2006,"I knew I was going to end up going to this film long before it hit the theaters. Mainly the reason has to do with the casting: my girlfriend would pay $20.00 just to see Keanu fold a piece of paper so I knew I was going to see the film one way or the other. Before I go further I must explain that I give the movie an '8'. I reserve '10's for classics like Kurosawa and David Lean films so an '8' is actually a pretty strong compliment. Aside from the fact that the movie is sometimes a little confusing (there are a few time-based paradoxes that do not quite add up and makes you think of a couple dozen Star Trek episodes dealing with time travel) it was a rather thoughtfully paced, fresh experience. I would hazard to guess that this film is rather warm-hearted, funny, and for that matter, fresh because it is actually a remake of a popular Korean film -- a good place to start if you are going to create a rather warm-hearted movie nowadays. Keanu's character is relateable as is Sandra Bullock's -- both of their portrayals feel honest. And therefore how the characters react to each other is rather refreshing. If you have two hours to kill go see this film. Chances are you will probably enjoy it.",The Lake House
184,rostsit,Beautiful but illogical,9,11 October 2020,"I gave this film 9 but only because I liked it overall. But any logic in this story is absent even in the established frames of a fairytale.The ending actually broke the rules that we had during the movie completely. Despite we saw numerous times that it is possible to change reality to the point of avoiding death (everything could be affected, from the physical objects like trees to memories), somehow and absolutely magically Kate (the main character alongside Alex) avoided the consequences of that changed reality. Alex survived and came to the place as instructed, but KATE shouldn't be there in this new reality she had created! Because Alex wasn't dead she wouldn't have that conversation with his brother nad wouldn't come there to wait for him!
Then there is the absolute stupidity of actions by the main characters. Well, Kate actually had one major nonsense with her last letter. Why to wait another 2 years??? Just to make sure they will meet there??? But even this shouldn't guarantee anything (see above why)! She should have just write about the bus!
But Alex easily tops anything. He KNEW Kate, he even KISSED her, he could have come to her any time! Ok, maybe he was hesitant because of her boyfriend. So what?? He had ALL THE LETTERS WITH THE DATES. He KNEW that they broke up and could have come to her AFTER if he didn't want to fight for her (which is strange at best).So many flaws in such a beautiful movie, but I don't regret seeing it.",The Lake House
185,clay_thompson,A Serious Fantasy Romance - whoda thunk,8,19 June 2006,"I watched the trailers for this movie and they piqued my interest, and since I have a love for science fiction and fantasy - if and when they are intelligently done -- I mentioned it to my wife. ""Well, I have a couple of gift passes to the local Regal, let's go on Father' Day."" And we did. It was time well spent.Before going I had read several reviews from the usual places, and in watching the movie realized that many of the reviewers did not understand the concepts or the filming techniques used to tell the story.The movie is an old fashioned romance of longing between two people who are kept apart by powers beyond their ability to overcome - a difficult thing to do in our age of air travel. In a significant way it reminds of me ""Peter Ibbetson"", the 1935 three hanky romance starring Gary Cooper. Gary's character ends up in prison for life but maintains a life long romance with a noble born woman who comes to him in his and her dreams.This is a movie that reflects to us that the essence of romance is an issue of heart and mind, not bodies bumping in the night.Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, playing together for the first time since ""Speed"" have a believable on screen chemistry although they spend very little time on screen together. They play a little against type, making us believe that they feel what they are playing. It was delightful.Now, I admit it was not for everyone. My wife is an absolutely linear thinker, and it stands her well in the educational field where she works. She asked how I liked, and I told her. She then said, ""I don't think I got it. Everyone around me was sniffing and dabbing their eyes, and I had to fight sleep through much of the movie."" She's always said I was the romantic in the family. It's not a chick flick, there were couples there, but the majority were women whose favorite hair color was either gray or white. Maybe that says something about me.If you are looking for an old fashioned story that will make you feel things, take your loved one and go. It'll help remind you why you got together in the first place.",The Lake House
186,rich920215,I've seen it finally,5,22 June 2006,"My wife and I are going to see it this weekend. I got a call from my brother in Georgia who saw it and loved it. Years ago I had forced my whole family to watch ""Somewhere In Time"" and everybody LOVED it. I have watched it straight through three times in a row when I first got obsessed with it and got my tape recorded off TV. I now have a DVD of it. I've considered attending the Somewhere In Time weekend at the Grand Hotel on Mackinaw Island but the travel and hotel accommodations are too expensive so I gave up on that. I continue to recommend it highly telling people to put the kids to bed and sit through it non-stop. My brother recommended The Lake House enthusiastically, saying it's much like Somewhere In Time. Basically if you liked Somewhere In Time you'll like The Lake House. I don't expect to fall in love with Sandra Bullock like I did with Jane Seymour. And Keanu Reeves is no Christopher Reeve. But I'm hopeful.OK, it's now January 15, 2008. I did see the movie and it's nowhere near as good as Somewhere In Time. It was sweet and romantic but it just didn't get me the way SIT did. Maybe it was the missing Rachmaninoff music. Plus Sandra Bullock is no Jane Seymour and Keanu Reeves is definitely no Christopher Reeve. Not even close.",The Lake House
187,DCJerzeygrl,why the film works....,9,13 June 2006,"Yes my Darlings, this is a dramatic, funny, romantic, time-travelin' movie. And the film succeeds because the chemistry between Keanu & Sandra is tangible. They've worked together before & genuinely like each other. It's the most important element; because their comfort level helps you believe the story and forget that you're watching Sandra & Keanu. As the characters get to know each other through correspondence, the film seduces you into suspended belief. Your left-brain's logical, analytical, fact-based reasoning doesn't want you to root for them, but your heart does. This film skips over the scientific & enables you to explore the tiniest possibilities of 'what if.......' Yes, it's corny, but so what. So is ROMANCE!

Suffice it to say, ""watch the part where it starts to snow and Keanu sneezes."" I don't think I've EVER seen such a poorly acted sneeze. But one couldn't expect much more from a movie where the writing doesn't have the characters act with extreme incredulity when faced with the premise that they are communicating in different times. It isn't a science fiction movie, after all. Just tried to post, wouldn't let me without 10 lines. OK, a little more comment: I think the only reason this movie got rated as high as it did on IMDb is that Keanu is a female favorite, and too many women are willing to put up with Keanu's acting limitations because of his pretty face.",The Lake House

Sandra and Keanu played it beautifully, they have great chemistry on screen. And they are are both so attractive that helps lift any movie. The plot is interesting and the other actors did an awesome job especially Christopher Plummer.His speech about captivating the light was indeed captivating. The location was great, I suppose Lake Michigan must be naturally beautiful which makes the photography really easy to deal with. But I can't help wonder if she was a bit too cool, they agree to meet (a situation 2 years into his future but the next day for her). He never turns up, and she drops him like a hot potato. Any woman truly in love as she appeared to be would try to find out why, especially for the fact that he obviously was more in love with her than she with him. The idea of meeting together had been his to start with. Why should he simply not come? It would not be that hard for her to track him down. How many Alex Wylers, architect, son of a famous Simon Wyler, are there in Chicago? She would find out sooner rather than later that he had passed away and how and where. As it was, the ending suffered. Although I like the fact that she ends up saving him from death and the way they meet in the end is very romantic. Well what can I say?

The only thing that rather grated on my nerves was that after having kissed Keanu in 2002, she never paid him any more attention, even though she was patently unhappy with Morgan. Eddies in the whirlpool of time could plausibly account for a lot of the apparent paradoxes - if we believe that such things exist - but what's the point in being so pedantic. The film is pure entertainment. It even managed to get a tear out of me towards the very end - no mean feat - and I switched off the television feeling generally satisfied.Bearing in mind the total crap on offer this year as new releases, I don't think it's particularly worthwhile trashing this under-appreciated little gem.",The Lake House

The movie's in-depth point is not only concerned with this fictional plot , where such questions and such roads are met in real life .Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are at their best . The setting is wonderful . The script is so fascinating that I could never think of it unadapted from a novel .However , the changes between Kate's time and Alex's time are mind-triggering and demand your watchful observation . There are many discussions and controversy about this part in exact , where the base of the plot ( where Kate lives in a time different from Alex's ) is certainly fictional , but that's not the point . The point is : even if you reasoned out all the changes and rationalized the whole movie -according to the fictional plot of course - you still won't be able to interpret what happened at the end ( SPOILER ALERT ) . How come that Kate , in 2008 , meets Alex , who should be by now in 2006 ?! Even if he waited for 2 years as she demands , it would have been 2008 in his reality but time will also take away Kate to 2010 ! I can't say I have found any reasonable explanation for this yet except that Alex waits somewhere till his 2008 comes and Kate waits those two years , same clothes , same manner beside the mailbox , till February , 14 , 2010 when they can possibly meet at the same place and time , although this is not considered in the movie where Kate just waits a few minutes and she finds Alex , which brings us once again to the main point.Overall , it's a movie worth watching , very beautiful , especially for those who love exploring themes of mystery , fate and questions of love ..",The Lake House

The film is a remake of the South Korean motion picture Il Mare (2000). The story centers on an architect living in 2004 and a doctor living in 2006. The two meet via letters left in a mailbox at the lake house they have both lived in at separate points in time; they carry on correspondence over two years, remaining separated by their original difference of two years. For Alex the time goes from 2004 to 2006. For Kate the time goes from 2006 to 2008. Critical reception - According to Rotten Tomatoes, 36% of the critics gave the movie a positive review. USA Today critic wrote, ""The Lake House is one of the more befuddling movies of recent years. The premise makes no sense, no matter how you turn it around in your head."" Roger Ebert, while pointing out the movie's logical inconsistencies, wrote, ""Never mind, I tell you, never mind!"" Ebert gave a positive review (3.5 stars out of 4) noting, ""What I respond to in the movie is its fundamental romantic impulse.""

If anyone enjoys romantic movies then I would definitely suggest watching this. It was amazing to see Keanu Reeves playing a role I don't think I could ever imagine him playing after the movies he has been in previously.

The movie keeps you guessing and yearning for Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves to get together. Both are great in the movie, but I was especially impressed with Keanu Reeves. It shows a side of him we don't often see. I think romance fans will really enjoy this one. It has a ""Somewhere in Time"" feel to it. It really made me wish something that fantastic could actually happen. Dylan Walsh has a nice supporting role, as well as Shohreh Agdashloo and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Keanu Reeve's estranged father. The relationship between the two is complicated and very well played by both. If you like a good romance I highly recommend it.",The Lake House
198,voxhumana,A great idea but poorly executed,4,18 May 2009,"This could have been a truly excellent film as the premise is fascinating. ""A tale of love frustrated"" is a classic theme, but this added a new twist with the lovers being separated by time. The film also hinted it wanted to explore the issue of ""addiction to a fantasy"", and ""knowing when to accept what you have got"".To its credit the film handles the logical problems of past/future communication well: it simply ignores them. There is a mailbox and some repeated hints that a dog is somehow involved, but that is as far as the movie ever goes in attempting to justify its central premise. I heartily approve of this - both Terminator 1 and Donnie Darko employed this same ""sit down and just accept it"" approach with huge success.However the film has numerous fatal weaknesses of a more basic kind - namely poor character development, implausible and/or irrational character behaviour within the context of the time-travel aspect, poorly developed (and probably unnecessary) subplots that lead to hopelessly underdeveloped minor characters, and an overly saccharine and terribly flat ending.All of this gives the feeling that the film was hastily rushed into development, and if they had taken time to do a few more rewrites then they could have created a masterpiece, rather than a film that feels like just another throw-away ""chick-flick"". And most disappointingly, the fascinating issues it hinted at exploring were never really dealt with.It's unfair to malign Bullock or Reeves as I don't think any actor could have done much better with the material. The pair actually create some genuinely sublime moments on occasion. As a result I think there is plenty more that could be done with this pairing should any producer see the potential.But great actors + poor script = bad movie. Just ask Al Pacino.So overall this is a real disappointment. I am secretly hoping that some writer somewhere will tackle this film's basic ideas again and create a script worthy of such a strong premise.",The Lake House

200,dan_delago,Good chemistry equals good romantic fantasy,8,16 June 2006,"Suspension of disbelief is a wonderful phenomenon. It's used in many genres effectively and why not in romantic film? Although the Lakehouse mailbox took on some magical qualities, the plot still worked for me on a deeper level. It's about connecting with your true soulmate when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt alone at a crowded party? Or who hasn't feared if they wait too long that they may never find that special someone? It's a part of the human condition this film examines. I mean, look at the architecture of the Lake House itself. It's isolated yet beautiful in a Frank Lloyd Wright kind of way.This is a character-driven story. It was fueled by the solid performances of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. They are so natural and comfortable together on screen. It's more than just physical attraction between two people and that's why the love story works. It's real chemistry between them. I believed these two could be walking along Lakeshore Drive holding hands together.I was rooting for these two characters to get together. They are likable. They have angst in their lives. They show vulnerability. Real human feelings. They are successful in their careers but there is still that void. In my opinion, they are the right fit for each other. It's the underlying themes of this movie that give it substance not the fact that some of the plot is a bit far-fetched. Love is illogical in many ways but when you find that certain someone, it's magical.David Auburn's screenplay is first-rate. It creates the right mood. It has emotion in each scene. He makes the story palpable. This kept me interested. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. What more can you ask for in a touching love story? I enjoyed it.",The Lake House
201,KarisLOVER,I wanted to like this...,9,9 July 2006,"If I have another hot and cold experience with a movie, I might snap. It's very annoying to love one part of a film, and truly despise the other. The Lake House, like so many of the movies I've seen lately, falls right in the middle of that category.Story wise, The Lake House is so confusing and convoluted, that it's funny. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock play a couple who live two years apart. No, Keanu isn't two years older than her, they live two years apart on the time-space continuum. He lives in 2004, her in 2006. They communicate through a (magic?) mailbox outside of Keanu Reeves' house. They fall in love even though they never make face to face contact. It's not the fact that it could ""never happen"" that makes it so bad, but the fact that it is so distracting. Many times, you're left wondering what year it is, rather than being engrossed in the love story.During the first half hour of this movie, I could have sworn I'd be giving out my second F of the year. Everything is extremely bad; the dialog, especially. Just as I was convinced that it couldn't be saved, Sandra turns it on and gives a great performance. The incredible chemistry between the two actors, driven mostly by Sandra Bullock, single handedly turns this movie around. By the time it was over, I still hadn't liked it, but I was feeling much more neutral towards it.Aesthetically, The Lake House is an Oscar worthy film. The cinematography is absolutely amazing. It had me dropping my jaw several times. The colors are rich and vibrant, but also muted in the right places. If this had been a silent film, I probably would have liked it better. I'm not sure what the composer, Rachel Portman, was thinking, but it sure worked. Every bit of the music for this film conveys exactly what it's supposed to. It's simply a flawless soundtrack.While I do commend the filmmakers here for attempting to freshen up the romance genre, I have huge problems with it. The best thing about the movie is Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves' chemistry. They are mesmerizing as a couple, but because of the convoluted premise, are physically together for about fifteen minutes of screen time. They are great in the letter voiceovers, but it's not the same as having them physically interact with each other.Walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but feel like this was a failure. No matter how much better the film got towards the end, it still had the first 30 minutes hanging over it's head. And even then, it was still predictable, corny, and too sweet. The ending would have been much more romantic if they had just let it happen. But, instead of possibly depressing someone (God, wouldn't that be horrible?) they opted for the picturesque happy ending. It's even complete with a shot of the couple walking off into the sunset, no joke.In closing, the reason why the film failed is this: No matter how interesting the premise is, it detracts from the experience. All I wanted was for the lead actors to be together on screen. I found myself wishing for a normal romantic movie, so I could be captivated by their brilliant chemistry. But instead, I was treated to a sublimely filmed, confusingly written, and completely forgettable movie",The Lake House
202,MarsFKA,For those who deserve a chance at happiness,7,27 January 2007,"When a story line pivots around a time portal letterbox, you have to suspend a certain amount of belief - all right, a lot of belief.I have always liked Sandra Bullock, and while his acting frequently resembles that of a block of wood, I have no real objection to Keeanu Reeves. In this film, however, I thought he gave one of his better performances. Bullock is, as always, excellent. The first films I saw her in were ""Demolition Man"" and ""Speed"", both of which were utter crocks, but made bearable by her daffy charm. Critics, and the paying public, like to make a big deal out of actors' limitations, which both these actors undoubtedly have, but, within those limitations, in this film, they perform exquisitely.The story line is replete with inconsistencies and plot holes, such as the ease with which the two lead characters accept that they are corresponding across time, and the loose floor board in Kate's apartment, in a place that she walks across at least four times a day, but only finds more than a year after moving in. When she discovers what is under the floor, the unanswered question is how did it get there? And where, in the lake house, is the attic? All I could see, sticking out of a flat roof, were clear skylights.I am a sucker for a happy ending and much prefer a story to end knowing that something worthwhile has happened - I firmly believe that those who deserve a chance at happiness will find it. It is also a pleasure to enjoy a quiet, thoughtful film, where there is no sex/ violence/filthy language - and if this sentence is a spoiler for anyone reading this before seeing the film, then hard luck for you. This is not an outstanding film, but it checked a lot of my positive boxes and when it goes on sale, I will probably add it to my collection.",The Lake House
203,slashism,Great chemistry seperated in time but not in space,10,2 October 2021,This is the kind of romantic comedy that got me into reconsidering this genre. It is the fantasy aspect of the film which adds to the romance and chemistry. Both Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock play their parts right. The movie is light hearted as in there are no villians as such in the movie. Misplaced people at the most. The ending is superb!,The Lake House
204,jch0066,Amazing...No plot holes and truly romantic.,10,3 July 2006,"I was told to avoid trying to understand the time-travel aspect of the movie and just enjoy the plot and premise. To my surprise, I found no problems with the probability of the fantasy. I saw no inconsistencies or anachronisms. It made sense, and although I had figured out the ending, I was still suspenseful. WARNING: SPOILERS!!!The one thing that I felt could have been elaborated was the significance of the house. I felt like if they'd of connected Kate's mom with Alex's father (remember the conversation over coffee about the long distance romance between Kate's mom and an unknown fellow?) I felt perhaps if they had worked into the plot that Alex's father had made the house as a tribute to the woman he didn't end up marrying (Kate's mom) it might have explained the house's power and suggested a ""the universe wanted these two together"" sorta thing. There was comedy, realism, heartbreak cynicism. You truly wanted the couple to end up together. Overall, I adored this movie.It's not just a chick flick, but a timeless romance!",The Lake House
205,ehutson2001,Have I been here before?,3,19 June 2006,"About 8 years ago, there was a made-for-television movie entitled ""The Love Letter"". It starred Jennifer Jason-Leigh and Campbell Scott who, although over a century apart, find a way to send letters to each other through a mysterious post office.Now, I have no idea which was actually written first. I realize that there are only so many ideas to be made into a movie. But, compared to ""The Love Letter"", this one was just sad. I know Bullock and Reeves are better actors than the impression this one would give. I may have unfairly gone into the movie wanting to compare it with ""The Love Letter"", but this just comes up short on so many levels.It's almost like Bullock and Reeves were just going through the motions. And the story-line, which could have made at least a fair movie, just provided a way to painlessly kill a couple of hours, nothing more.I hate to be this negative about any movie. But, if you feel you must see it, do yourself a favor and wait until it comes out on video and rent it. You'll save yourself a few bucks and, if it is too much to tolerate in one sitting, you can take a break in the middle of it.",The Lake House
206,nadiatownshend,Can this be happening?,8,12 April 2018,"Th Lake House is subtle in approach and although it lets itself flow at it's own pace - there was not a dull moment. 
If you want lots of action - this is not what you're looking for. 
But if you want a moving story, with an intriguing character study and wonderful romantic story of friendship and love then look no further. 
I do not like soppy love stories so don't get the wrong end of the stick here - this film is not soppy - it's moving and touching and makes you think about life, the people in your life, missed chances, and connections. People often complain about Reeve's ""wooden acting"" - I have to say - I don't know what they are talking about because I think he is a fine actor and he's really wonderful in this. People should give him more credit - his turn in the Lake House might well be one of my favorites of his. Sandra Bullock is also a wonderful actress and her talents should not be taken for granted - it is always a delight to watch her on screen and her turn here as Kate is sensitive and charming and also real. There's no question here when it comes to Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves on-screen chemistry - the two are always a wonderful pair ever since Speed and here they work well together once again. If you're looking for a kind of drama with some touching elements and real human story then check it out. I guarantee you this may well become one of your favorite films. For a fresh story, script and chemistry-filled acting I give this 8/10 because as a plus it is also totally re-watchable - think I've probably seen it over a dozen times.",The Lake House
207,edebrajjean,"Why Has This Not Been Done Before? And If It Has, Why Has No One Told Me!",10,8 October 2006,"I ordered this movie on DVD online Thursday, September 28, 2006, never having heard of it and simply because it was advertised at my DVD club website and I am well aware of these two actors' chemistry in 1994's ""Speed,"" and thusly, thought it would be entertaining. Received it Friday, October 5, 2006 three days ago; finally got around to viewing it yesterday evening, Sunday, October 7, 2006. Why has this not been done before, and if it has why has no one told me! THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! I am not into time travel anything because there's no such thing, but the way it is done in this movie blends fantasy, science fiction and romance in a way that grips you from the beginning and then bowls you over with all the 'speed' of a runaway bus! It is fantastic! There was not a scene in this movie that did not work, leaving me rooting for the characters of Dr. Kate Forster and architect Alex Wyler, getting to know each other through correspondence from her present year of 2006 and his present year of 2004 two years ago, to come together in of course, present day 2006 where he had not yet arrived. I had no idea where writer David Auburn was going with this movie even as I watched spellbound at what I perceived to be an original idea, but when it got toward the end, I screamed in excitement and anticipation of the happiness to come because I saw exactly were he was going and knew he was going to pull it off. And he did it brilliantly; in fact, I wish I had written this story! I don't know where I was when this movie opened in theaters earlier this year, but I am too thankful I found it at my DVD club two days after its release date which I just found to be September 26, 2006, my birthday! This is the best birthday present I ever got. Everybody should go and get this movie. Ten stars for writer David Auburn and the fabulous imagination that produced this blend of fantasy, science fiction and romance. And TEN STARS for stars Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for finally giving us another one. Twelve years of waiting for them to co-star in another movie since they did 'Speed' in 1994, and in this release, they have topped themselves. 2006's 'The Lake House' was well worth the wait!",The Lake House
208,sparkster24,Simplicity itself,7,16 July 2006,"The main confusion about this film arises from the fact that that it is over simplistic. It isn't an intrinsically 'bad' film and the director has clearly understood what it takes to make a 'Rom' film using the device of time travel. Alejandro has also understood that if something is complex, people will not understand it. The opposite has happened here - paradoxically, things are so simple that no one understands it. I suppose if you want to see a 'romance' then one should expect to get a 'romance'and this is exactly what people got here.Actually, the story of film is very basic and it could be summarised in a few lines - Keanu is in 2004, Sandra in 2006. They can communicate through a time-travelling letter box and, of course, what Keanu does in 2004 can affect what Sandra does in 2006 (given two years wear and tear.) And that's about it, folks! Not hard to understand is it? Unfortunately, I believe this over-simplification is the film's downfall in that it makes no attempt to state why there is a time-travelling letterbox and, more importantly to me, what the point of the dog was. Moreover, if you are trying to look for an clever ending then you wont find one here.This film sees two excellent protagonists - do not believe any reports which tell you otherwise. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves seem to work very naturally together (which is possibly why they were selected to star in the film). The scenery is also brilliant and a certain mood is well created by the director.Ultimately though, this film is just uninspiring. My girlfriend and I walked out of the picture as soon it had finished and went straight into another film so to not let the dirty taste of 'The Lake House' linger. If you're not into romantic films do not see it! Because of some good acting I'd rate it a measly 7 (which is actually being rather generous).",The Lake House
209,busstnactgrp,Misses an obvious trick,6,13 January 2009,"This was the Monday night film on BBC One last night (12.01.2009) which I watched with some incredulity, even though, all the time, I kept thinking to myself, ""it's a film - NOT real life"". Ergo, one is SUPPOSED to suspend a deal of belief, obvious plot-holes or no. It was reasonably well-acted, for what it was, for which reason I give it a marginally above-median mark of 6/10.As one of two brothers myself (the younger thereof) whenever two brothers are featured in a film I inevitably home in on the handling of the younger sibling's character. One cannot have failed to notice that the difference in ages of the two architect brothers was TWO years - exactly the gap between the two sets of events posited in the film. Why the younger brother's character was so under-written, therefore, is a potential plot-twist that went tragically unexploited (that's why I have placed a potential spoiler alert on this comment). As far as I can make out, as well, no other reviewers on this site have noticed this.Intriguing premise, though.",The Lake House

I liked the fact that you started to care about these two through the dog. They both love this dog...and I liked that about them.I like both of these actors in most things they are in. They have a chemistry and all through the movie you're wondering if/how they will ever get together. I like all the ""thinking"" you have to do along the way.I liked this movie for many reasons but the overall thing was that I really cared about what happened to the two characters.It is definitely a date movie or a chick flick.

211,The_BIGGEST_Critic,"Fun idea, but plausibility, script, chemistry and weak ending",4,10 October 2006,"The concept behind ""The Lake House"" is a good one: A architect, who's father built a lake house, moves in only to find that he's receiving cryptic letters in his mail box from a woman who claims to have lived in the same house two years in the future! They begin a future-past penpal relationship and fall in love. But can they possibly ever get past the time-travel issues and meet in person? The idea is a fun one to play with and the execution is pretty decent, but there are some script writing blunders and plausibility problems that frustrate the viewer (see spoiler notes at The Biggest Critic website), as well as a tepid ending that doesn't nearly live up to the rest of the movie.Sandra Bullock works reasonably well in this movie as Kate Forster, though she plays her character a little more morosely than I think she should have. Perhaps she was trying to get the point across that this woman has basically given up on ever finding a mate? Keanu Reeves does a yeoman's job of playing Alex Wyler, an architect and Kate's love interest. I thought this role would be better done by John Cusack, but Reeves was satisfactory (and was even able to show some acting ability in this movie). I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that Reeves and Bullock were reunited primarily because of their work in ""Speed"". Whatever. Christopher Plummer made a cameo appearance as Alex' father, but the role wasn't particularly notable for anything except that the father, also an architect, is the one who built the lake house.There are always plausibility problems in time travel movies, and this one is no exception. The only thing a scriptwriter can do is try to minimize the damage by accounting for as many of the potential problems as possible. Unfortunately, there are some real doozies in ""The Lake House"" that present brain-scrambling issues for the viewer, especially at the end of the movie (again, see spoiler notes). That means that you better go in knowing that you're going to be frustrated if you think too much in this movie. The tone and pace of the movie is good, and the chemistry is okay between the lead characters...not great, just okay. Production values are high, as one would expect in a A production. The ending was weak. After all that happened in the movie, and all the buildup of suspense (will they meet or won't they?) the script really just kind of petered out at the end, like they just wanted to wrap it up and call it a day.I was really hoping to be moved by ""The Lake House,"" at least as a straight romance and I gave it every opportunity I could. Ultimately, however, it came up just a little short in scriptwriting, plausibility, and chemistry. I would recommend ""The Lake House"" for slow video nights, romance fans, or fans of the two lead actors, but not much else.Rating: 4/10 -The Biggest Critic",The Lake House
212,henry325,second rate copy...,6,22 January 2007,"The Lake house is a remake of Il_Mare, it says so in the beginning. I recommend watching that over this. The background is this, there is a lake house with a mailbox, the mailbox transcends time and acts as a portal to both the present and 2 years into the past. Bullock, a doctor, and Keanu, an architect, begin to correspond through the mailbox and thus fall in love.The story itself is basically the same as Il_Mare, but this movie plays up the romance and down plays the drama. If Il_Mare is an emotional roller-coaster then the Lake House is an emotional merry go round. The connection between the two leads is done fairly well, but Keanu is still Keanu and looks lost at every turn.I liked drama over romance, maybe you like romance over drama. But I still think if you compare Il_Mare to Lake House, you'll see Il_Mare is far more powerful and thats why I rate this movie a 6, although I'll let it slide that it isn't original, it doesn't stay true to the feel of the original story. It went from something that could have been unique in theaters to just another feel good romance date movie. I give it a 6 just cause the story and filming are sound, I just didn't really appreciate the different feel.",The Lake House
213,AshGurl2897,Gorgeous!,9,16 June 2006,"""The Lake House"", starring long time friends Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock - working together again for the first time since ""Speed"" (1994) - is a story of semi-magical connection between a man and a woman which spans the width of two years. You see, Kate (Bullock) and Alex (Reeves) have both lived in the same gorgeous house made entirely of glass. Kate is moving out and leaves a letter in the mailbox wishing the next tenant good luck and enjoyment in the house, as well as a forwarding address for her mail. Through movie magic (and possibly fate), Alex - who just purchased the house - receives this letter and the two begin to correspond.Confused at first, they soon realize they are living two years apart, Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006. While an odd set of circumstances (and theoretically impossible), they continue to write. Both are failures when it comes to relationships and they find the letters a great chance to talk to someone of the opposite sex and not have to face rejection. Soon they fall in love but are not sure how they could ever meet to make a relationship work because of the time issues. They share a dog (too complicated to explain here) and their hearts. Attempts to meet do not work and they begin to lose hope. Can they find a way to be together? Or will this simply be another failed relationship to add to their lists? Despite what people have been saying, I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Lake House."" Complex, sci-fi plot aside, it comes down to a story about how two peoples lives change when they allow themselves to connect. It's honest. Its cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are good. Keanu and Sandra have an amazing on-screen chemistry as we have witnessed before (in Speed), but here it is more mature. Sandra delivers a performance closer to her character in ""Crash"" (2005) and less like that of ""Miss Congeniality."" Kate is a charming but self-conscious and lonely woman. Keanu gives what I believe is his best performance in a movie yet! His famous slightly ""wooden"" acting style is perfect for the character of lonely architect Alex, and he can really become someone quite believable and open in the moments when his character is happy. While the two do not share much direct on-screen time, that serves to make the moments they do share it SO desirable. The viewer longs to see Alex and Kate meet face to face and for this relationship to work out for them. Especially delightful, were the voice-overs (of the letter reading and writing) which filled the movie as other things happened. It was a clever way to keep them from always sitting at a desk and brightened the tone of the film overall.Forget thinking about how all the time travel works, that's not the important part. The important point of this movie is the relationship between these two people. The magic of the time transcending mailbox only serves to bring them together, but so do many other things in their lives (as we come to find out). It gives the viewer hope that maybe they are destined for love like this - maybe not with the assistance of a post office receptacle - but fated in some way to meet that one person for them.""The Lake House"" is a touching film, free of all the hustle and bustle of modern American cinema and culture in general. There's no emailing, just good old-fashioned letter writing. It's a throwback to the real movies - before we forgot how to make them - before we forgot that a movie is about the people in it and not about sex, drugs and rock and roll. ""The Lake House"" is a beautiful film and you should really go see it. Don't go in expecting it to all make sense, but go in with an open heart and open eyes and let it win you over. Critics have gone to theaters with their arms crossed and their minds made up already. Take a lesson from Alex and Kate, open your heart and see what happens.

The story was so well written that you just accepted the idea of the magical postbox and also the shared dog who seemed to know more than she was letting on. Although the couple hadn't met at the beginning of the story a chance encounter brought about by said dog leads to Alex meeting Kate(Sandra Bullock)at a party where he knows who she is but she doesn't know him yet and it is one of the most romantic and poignant encounters imaginable as he obviously can't tell her about their correspondence in her future in case she thinks he's insane but they have such an obvious connection. The sad truth about what has happened to Alex comes to the audience before it hits Kate and there-in lies the reason for the story as it becomes obvious that her letters from the future were the cause of what happened to him and she is able to change things to the way they should have been which just makes the ending even more emotional.

219,rick-keseley,"A confused mess of ""flashback"" elements.",5,1 July 2006,"The plot of this film is an attempt to explore a romance where the impediment is a two year time shift. The story is told in a flashback motif where Reeves is in 2004 and Bullock in 2006. Bullock's memories are Reeves' realities, but they can also communicate in real time. Unfortunately, throughout the film, the time gap keeps getting smaller between the characters so you don't know always whose reality is being referenced and the real chronology. The use of Valentine's Day in the three different years is especially confusing. Illogical plot elements abound. For example, how can they share the same dog and why is there a book under the Kate's floorboards.More distracting is the inability of Kate Forster(Bullock)to make simple connections and obvious deductions in the present despite ""prophetic"" comments by Alex Wyler(Reeves)as he populates Kate's recent past with actual encounters informed by ""realtime"" communications from the present. It's really hard to believe that screenwriter/playwright, David Auburn, who managed such amazing depth of character in ""Proof"" provides so little character work here. Reeves' performance adds nothing appealing. This is no ""Walk in the Clouds"".On the bright side, Bullock creates range in her role and makes the obvious ending work.(I actually teared up.)

I was impressed at Keanu's performance; he's certainly improving, and Sandra Bullock is also good. (Jack, the dog outshines them both, though.) BUT, here it comes, this is yet another sappy rom-com that has one gigantic hole in the center. ************************ GIGANTIC SPOILER **********************Look at the guy who is laying face down in the street. It's obvious who that is from the back of his head, so the mystery should fly right out the window at that that point. My biggest gripe is that this woman has danced, talked to, KISSED Alex (Reeves) only two years before, and when she comes upon him as a car wreck victim she doesn't recognize him? I can remember what people looked like that I went to grade school with. How is it that she doesn't put two and two together that Alex has died? Once this big hole sat there like a rock, I lost all interest in this film. Also why can't Hollywood just let it be that these two had a relationship that wasn't consummated? That was never realized? Like the romance novels, they fuel that stupid belief that if women wait around long enough Prince Charming, the man of their dreams will come riding into their lives and everything will be perfect. Yawn. Boring.I'm glad that John Cusack just said no to this, because he's going to become typecast as this kind of guy. Keanu needs to start saying no, too.

222,wcrawford-07339,Could have been better,5,5 April 2021,"I love both actors in this film. However I felt like Sandra Bullocks character Kate was too depressed it made for very flat viewing! She was so flat and depressed which kind of grated on me. It got off to a slow start I felt. It got better about half way through. It was kind of creepy how lonely they both were writing to a stranger and not knowing what the other looked like or how old they were at the beginning when they started writing, I mean Jesus how desperate are this doctor and architect! It annoyed me how Kate went back to that other guy and settled temporarily. I'm glad it had a happy ending! So that was satisfying. But really, it was just a bit flat I thought... it was okay but yeah....a bit meh.",The Lake House

Then Read MINE.,10,18 July 2010,"I first saw my wife and the love of my life crossing the intersection of Telegraph and Durant Avenues in Berkeley on her mother's 51st birthday in 1968, 3 weeks before my 14th birthday, dressed in a black silk top hat, long black velvet cape and dress. That girl became the template for every other woman I would be attracted to in my life. I didn't MEET her until 1989 in the SF Bay Area around the quake time. In the months around the quake, we got together as fellow writers but both our soon-to-be-exes accused of of having an affair, which we weren't. But it planted the seed in both our minds. For me, I had three straws to break before I could finally see clearly.1. Cutting off the 580 shooter on the Oakland freeways the first night he murdered someone.2. Having to go back INTO SF after the 89 quake to keep long-distance service working. You may not have been able to call across town, but you COULD call across the country because of my work.3.The day before Thanksgiving in 89 when I didn't go to work to care for my sick daughter. So I didn't take the California St. cable car and get off at California and Kearney with my wife like I did every other day and it made the light. FORTY SECONDS later a 60-ton construction crane fell into that intersection and killed 6 people.We left with each other on Dec 1. So, what does all this have to do with ""The Lake House""? Twice a day, on the ferry ride from Vallejo to SF, we passed THIS place, Sandy Beach:http://yfrog.com/3xsandybeachbysea002j and we would both talk about what a cool place to live it would be.When we had the courage to act on our love, I was looking for a place for us to live and actually FOUND a place there pictured here:http://yfrog.com/3xlovenest004j http://yfrog.com/3x9sandybeach002j On The Dock Of The Bay.It was a month after we moved in that my wife told me ALL about hanging out in Berkeley in 1968 between Shakepeare's and Cody's Bookstores at the intersection of Telegraph and Durant Avenues dressed in a black silk top hat, long black velvet cape and dress. My answer, ""I wish you would have told me that at the beginning. I would have saved us a lot of time."" We wound up living on the Dock of The Bay for 5 years and got to come down THIS road every night to THIS view.http://yfrog.com/6yroadtoparadise002gd9j",The Lake House
225,jdavidbakr,Almost perfect,7,25 March 2007,"We rented this movie after seeing (and being disappointed by) Preminition and reading reviews that this movie is much more solid than Preminition. After seeing them both on back-to-back nights, I agree. The only reason I'm giving it a 7 and not a higher ranking is because I felt that the directing and editing was a little weak (the pacing of several scenes were distracting, it took me a long time to get into it, and I was jarred out of the movie into being an audience member several times because of the way it was edited/directed.) But the story is nearly perfect. There are a few nit-picky things that when analyzed thoroughly don't fit within the rules that the filmmakers set up, but you have to think kind of hard to find them (as opposed to Preminition where the flaws are so obvious and so easily fixable that you want to take the filmmakers out and shoot them for squandering such a brilliant premise... but I digress, this review is about The Lake House...) It is strange that Sandra Bullock did two so similar movies back-to-back like she did, but I guess they are very different even though they are so similar. If the director of Preminition had done The Lake House, I probably would have rated it a 9 or a 10.",The Lake House

All that is nice. So great to have a good romance with a twist up on the big screen without a lot of hullabaloo for effect. Reeves and Bullock mesh with ease, a belonging unequaled since Bogie and Bacall. Kneau & Sandra, let's do it again! Don't wait so long.This movie can be watched on the small screen without loosing its dynamics if you missed it in the theater. Listen to the critics with a grain of salt. Not all dots have to connect to make the watching enjoyable. Invite a friend, get the corn popped, curl up on the couch with a fuzzy blanket, a few pillows and let the snow fly outside. It's that kind of winter movie for the DVD watcher.",The Lake House

Bad Acting, Bad Dialog",7,15 July 2006,"Now I will be the first to admit I wasn't thrilled to see this movie to begin with but after watching it I actually quite enjoyed it. The fact that they were living two years apart was very interesting and the few twists and turns at the end of the movie kept me waiting for the end to see what was going to happen. But as for the acting, this may possibly be K. Reeves worst acting to date, and whoever played his brother was also a terrible actor. The letters written between the two of them were written beautifully but as for the dialog between either main character and a minor character, it was terrible. The dialog just added nothing to the movie. Despite the acting and the dialog I would still recommend seeing this movie!",The Lake House
228,jameselford,The Lake House has all the charm of a wet blanket,4,1 March 2007,"I had the dubious pleasure of watching this film with my girlfriend about three weeks ago. It was recommended to us by my girlfriend's aunt and she vowed that we would love it.So much for vows...To discuss the plot, even in brief, would actually ruin the entire film. That's how threadbare it is. Suffice to say, it involves two lovelorn characters drifting through life, seemingly disconnected from all the joys and pleasures of the supporting characters in the film. Both lack any charisma or charm. Now to those of you who have watched Keanu Reeves ""act"", this comes as no surprise. I really dug his characters in ""Speed"" and ""Devil's Advocate"". That was because he does ""eager"", ""anxious"" and ""angry"" very well, I believe. But give him a sad and lonely character and you might as well watch a cardboard box for 2 hours.As for Sandra Bullock...poor Sandra. She's so pretty, and funny, and brings glee to pretty much any movie she touches. Except this one. Strangely, just like Keanu, she just drifts through the story without making any real connection to her surrounding characters, or the audience. I felt no empathy towards her, Keanu, or the plot; just boredom.The final insult was the ever-so-necessary leap-of-faith of a conclusion. Now I'm no cynic---OK I'm a little cynical but in a constructive way---but the plot twist at the end is diabolical. Not only does it bend the brain in terms of logic, but in general it's even more hokey and less believable than the other events throughout the film. It's like building a house of cards on a unicycle. The director lost his footing from the beginning, and it all came crashing down at the end.The supporting cast were interesting, at most. Christopher Plummer, as usual, owns his part and fills it naturally. But when his character's so unlikeable, then it makes any events involving him a little deterring. Dylan Walsh (of TV show ""Nip/Tuck"") makes what could nearly be called a cameo in this film. He creates near-zero impact on the tale, and doesn't feel like he belongs. I spent the entire film hoping for some redeeming factor. But the acting, the direction, the pace...the whole thing seemed to rely on sleepifying plot points based on themes of lost loves, loneliness and above all, heartbreak. Last time I checked, though, these themes are supposed to provoke empathy, joy and anguish---The Lake House, sadly enough, provokes fatigue and nausea.No thanks. Four out of ten.",The Lake House

230,Jobi14,It's okay...,7,16 June 2006,"I know I shouldn't reminisce about movies from long ago. You know those movies...the kind where the characters are so intoxicated with love and the story is so complete that no matter who you are male or female, cynic or hopeless romantic, you enjoy watching it again and again. Runaway Bride, Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, You've Got Mail, and City of Angels are all really good examples. But there seems to be something lacking in twenty-first century romance films.Although The Lake House is sweet and the characters are enjoyable it fails to inspire a sense of completeness. The background of the characters isn't fulfilling and the story seems cut short. There is a point, however, when Bullock is younger and you get a glimpse of some prior existence, a sensitivity and aversion to intimacy that is satisfied by the introduction of Keanu Reeves.I liked the movie, but there wasn't much magic to save it from the ever expanding list of mediocre romantic movies. Nevertheless, I was very grateful that the filmmakers decided to use the GOOD ending, otherwise I might not have been so nice in this review.",The Lake House

I loved the fact that Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves can write each other though the mailbox. It's like they're meant for each other when not making The Lake House because of Speed in 1995. I liked how Keanu kept changing Sandra's 2006. This movie had everything. Death, Love, and Comedy, Like the IMing each other at the mailbox, Sandra telling Keanu to call her and then her phone rang, and Sandra's nurse friend was funny, too. It wasn't even confusing for me. I understood the whole thing. Just one thing I was confused about, I didn't know that person that go hit by the truck was Keanu. When I saw him later and he was going to cross the street, I found out that he got hit. I want to see this movie for a third time but I've seen too many movies this week. That's how much I love this. So go see and have a good time. I'm just glad that people I write to are in the same year as I am. Unless I (in Chicago) write to someone in New York on New Year's Eve while I'm in 2006 and they just had 2007. That'd be kind of cool. But it wouldn't be the same day two years apart like in The Lake House.",The Lake House
234,dss-2,nice romantic comedy even though it ignores science,8,8 July 2006,"This is a nice film. Sandra Bullock and Keenau Reeves go well together. The developing relationship is believable at least to those that have seen 84 Charing Cross Road, Somewhere in time, and Kate and Leopold. Why a mail box can form a bridge in time or a dog can be in both places at once requires a leap of faith that can be difficult for some. The blithe alteration in the time line without consequence should make science fiction fans groan in pain. My biggest complaint is what happened to the dog. The dog forms a key bridge between time lines, yet is gone in the last scene. I cannot believe that the focus groups who screened the movie were not moved by the presence and then the discarding of the dog. Finally this is one of the few recent films without any digital effects houses -- kind of old fashioned in that respect",The Lake House

My movie buddy friend and I really wanted to see this when it came out in theaters. Due to our differing schedules, we just never ended up seeing it in theaters together, but she did see it without me. She liked it, but theorized that I wouldn't. And she was probably right, based on the reviews and based on the cheesiness of the plot and storyline, it did have ""thumbs down"" written all over it for me.So, when it came out on DVD a couple of months ago, I picked it up, remembering that she liked it and thought I wouldn't. I watched it that afternoon and remembering thinking at the end, there's some element of this movie that really appeals to me. I mean, the story is somewhat confusing and if you really start to analyze it, I admit, that there are definitely some holes. But, if you look at it with less critical eyes, you will see as I do: this is an amazing film. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are well cast as Alex and Kate -- I completely believed they were these characters that fell in love with each other though they live in different times. This is definitely a movie that grows on you with time -- it leaves you with a 'warm, fuzzy' feeling at the end. It is satisfying, and for some reason, it leaves me feeling good inside.

Characters say exactly what they think. No creativity/cleverness. 7) The direction is so over the top it distracts the story (every shot a ""money shot""? pulease.) 6) No one ever questions the premise. He/she is in the future/past? right. okay. How about upping your meds, pal? 5) The guy who plays Reeves' brother is God-awful. Brotherly dialogue is also atrocious (see #8) 4) The script stinks to high heaven. 3) The lighting and colors are so overly-dramatic in just about every shot, distracting from the story - if there is one - even more. 2) The premise is full of holes that aren't even worth getting into. 1) Did I mention the bad script??? Oh, and I love IMDb's ""If you like this movie, you'll like 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'"" (re: For those that like everything even really, REALLY bad movies, perhaps you'll like this stinker too.)

I cannot believe that they made a movie like this, while overlooking so many obvious blunders. The most noticeable to me, was that they make a big point of the Paul McCartney song, which wasn't released until a year and a half after the movie was supposedly taking place. I think Sandra Bullock's acting could've been better, and I wasn't expecting all that much from Reeves. John Cusack, who was originally cast, would have been much more appropriate for the role.

238,TheHarshAndLastWord,A romance movie minus the typical,10,25 June 2006,"By first view the Lake House looks like any another typical romance movie. Lonely man meets lonely woman and their journey coming together. Yet something distinctifies itself in The Lake House. The unique storyline really sets up the whole situation, yet it's the chemistry between the actors that really moves this movie along. Yes there's talking, a lot of it. So what. The story blossoms much like a rose, and like a rose there's many layers. Yet what twists The Lake House is the time warp factor. The ability to fall in love with someone despite the unusualness of the interaction. A love like that is something rare to find now a days and would appeal to those hopeless romantics. It's something everyone wants to have, a true meaningful relationship with no strings or boundaries. The Lake House is beyond those ""coming of age"" movies, but the tone fits all ages. Love is possible no matter what age, time or place.It isn't exactly ground breaking, but definitely a winner for a first date or a good night out with your loved one. When the situations play out you feel as if you are right there with the characters and can't wait to see what happens next...thumbs up from me.and that's the final word.",The Lake House

242,UKBio,"""Somewhere in Time"" for the 21st Century",9,22 June 2006,"I saw this movie on opening night, June 16, 2006 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.My favourite movie of all time was ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980) which starred Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. I have often wished that someone would remake, not that movie - because it is perfect as is, but more the sensibility and many of the themes of that movie.There are many parallels here. It is partly set in Chicago. It is about time travel of a sort that relates to time blocking you from the one you love. Christopher Plummer, who played Jane Seymour's manager in ""Somewhere in Time"" here plays a variation on that crotchety character in the role of Keanu Reeves' father - nicely bookending his career. Also, the similarity in the last names of the lead - Christopher Reeve; Keanu Reeves.There are so many things I loved about this movie. The soundtrack was pitch perfect, including everything from Nick Drake to Carole King. The wardrobe was beautifully chosen, conveying warmth and romance. The script was measured and never overblown. The performances were genuine and real, even though the subject matter could be taken as fanciful by the unromantic at heart. The direction and cinematography were breathtaking. I would have given it a 10 but for the fact that in some spots the looping for dates was a bit off.There are many twists and turns, and you never know until the last moment how it will actually end. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and sobbing by the end of it. This is the movie I have been waiting for Keanu Reeves to make for the longest time - I always knew he had this performance in him, but was disappointed by the artificiality of films like Sweet November. And Sandra Bullock has never been better. This is a new addition to my all time top five movies.You will never look at slow dancing the same way again. I promise.",The Lake House

Not gonna spoil it for you people, but try to stay focused from the very beginning. I missed only 5 minutes from the start and I found myself struggling to understand the ending...
The movie is not a cheesy love story, is a complex story involving three separate time lines, an inbox, a dog, a letter and a note.

Starring the famous duo from ""Speed,"" Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves costar again to ignite theaters and enlighten their viewers with a unique and obvious chemistry. This time the two moved away from endless bus rides and crazy killers to star in a lightly toned timewarped film about two people that fall in love, but live in two different time periods.The movie brings an edge, a twist to romancea couple that fall in love but have no idea who the other person is. Typically we see hot and saucy movies where couples jump in the sack together and can't keep their hands off of each other, but this movie seems to almost support couples that fall in love for the sake of personality, chemistry, words and interests.

Throughout the movie, you go through ups and downs in their life including how each one of them deals with his/her own family & personal problems and how they try to support and condole each other in this long distance relationship.PROS: talents of actors/actresses and the chemistry among them that's reflected in this passionate fairytale. Many touching moments. Deep and moving story CONS: first 20 minutes were frustrating.

252,Nilsosmar-2,"Some good, some bad",5,5 September 2012,"The Lake House is an okay movie. It held my attention about half of the time. The performances were just okay. The characters were pretty flat.The scene in which Bullock and Reeves dance and kiss had some nice emotional tension.The SF/fantasy element was somewhat interesting, but would have been better if just a little more thought had gone into it. Moving on to some serious story problems (SERIOUS SPOILER ALERT -- stop reading if you haven't seen it):  About halfway through the story, Bullock's character makes a date with Reeves. He doesn't show up. She assumes the worst (though it's never said what exactly she assumes). Why? Why totally break things off, when you're in a deep romantic relationship, because of one broken date? Why doesn't it occur to her (as it does to him, and surely must to the audience) that something might or must have happened to him? Bullock's character does little that's decisive in the movie, but her abrupt decision to dump the guy because he didn't show up, without any explanation, makes her seem shallow and a little stupid.  Not a big point, but the story was set in 2006 (and 2004), but the characters did not have access to the internet. There did not appear to be an internet. If there was one, her first action, if she had half a brain, on realizing she was corresponding with a man from the past, would have been to look him up and see ""what's he doing today."" If he missed her date, she would have done some more digging. A world with magical mailboxes, I can accept; a world without an internet is actually harder to believe. It's more than passing odd that in the time-line when he dies in her arms, after being hit by the bus that collided with the car, she didn't remember him. It's true that she had only met him once, at a party, but she had danced with him and kissed him there. Her boyfriend certainly remembered Reeves, enough to recognize him in the street and walk up to him angrily years after the kiss. Why didn't Bullock? Minor point, but, who was she paying rent to, when she was renting the Lakehouse? I can understand why he turned around and avoided being killed in the car/bus crash, but it appeared there was no crash in the altered reality. Why didn't it happen? And if it didn't, why did he need to stay away? The story had so many sentimental elements, and the dog had so much to do with the sentiment, it seems odd that it wasn't around in the final scene. It could easily have been worked into the story, with a tiny amount of thought.I don't mind a few story holes, but the ones in The Lakehouse could have been avoided with a little care and forethought. It was touching... I do understand why people liked it.... but I also think we have the right, as moviegoers, to expect that the plots will make basic sense. It's fine if they drift into fantasy, but the characterization has to make sense.",The Lake House
253,wenfig,Beautiful Movie,10,20 June 2006,"I saw this movie with my seventeen year old son. Both of us enjoyed it.Now for the spoilers. The dog and the mailbox helped to keep the mood light. We bonded with the dog , since our own thinks he's human too. I read a complaint that there was no explanation for the time rift. I disagree. I felt that the rift was caused by the untimely accident, which would have separated two people who were meant for each other.The flick was a little predictable, but that's okay. I didn't figure out the twist till halfway through. This movie moves at a comfortable pace. The dialog and performances were believable. The cinematography was stunning. Keanu and Sandra have a natural chemistry and their roles captured our imaginations and attention. We were both trying to figure out how to get these two characters together.This movie will be added to our collection of favorites.",The Lake House
254,bm317,surprisingly wonderful,8,27 March 2007,"After seeing the trailer, I didn't expect the Lake House to be a great movie. But it is creative, weirdly believable, not overly sentimental, engaging, on and on. My only real criticism is that the ending is too short and quick, even quicker than the usual Hollywood formula of giving only a minute or two for the resolution. I didn't time it but I think this one gets about 20 seconds. After all that we went through to get there? The ending is also the one part of the movie where the direction falls short. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are both top notch actors in the romantic drama and romantic comedy genres. They somehow manage to have great chemistry throughout this film, though they are seldom together; it is especially there at the party where they actually meet and interact. But their chemistry is lacking in the last scene. This is due to the directing, the choreography of their long awaited encounter, followed by the too short and simple ""resolution"". This short ""let's get it over with"" ending left me feeling a slight lack of resolution, after such a good film.",The Lake House

It is powerful yet tender, it is filled with profound yearning, it takes hold of you on many levels.It is definitely not for the unimaginative, or the unperceptive.

It's the tunnel-vision teen-girl time tunnel. The one that never gets used to generate limitless wealth through betting scams! Other than this, it was just tedious.

But if you're a hopeless romantic who enjoys a good love story, despite the fact that the plot may be rather implausible, this is a wonderful movie! Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock make a great team(once again) and really cause you to be drawn to the characters they are portraying. I didn't mind in the least that the idea of someone being able to communicate w/ someone else in a different time zone is completely and utterly impossible. The fact of the matter is it's a love story and you shouldn't have to delve that deeply into it. Just enjoy it.

I will definitely be buying The Lake House when it comes out on DVD. Two thumbs up!",The Lake House
259,rghawkin,Interesting and touching fantasy/romance,8,16 June 2006,"This is a touching, well-acted, and beautiful looking film. Sandra Bullock and Keannu Reeves have great chemistry together and the supporting actors are very competent. The story is absorbing and interesting, and although its a time-travel fantasy, it's logical within it's basic premise.Don't listen to the people who claim bad acting. The acting is fine and the chemistry between the leads is very real. Anyone who gave this movie a bad rating was definitely in the minority in their theater - most people at the showing I attended clapped and cheered at the end and many stayed to watch the credits roll - always a sign of a good, and touching, movie.As for those people who claim that the story is ""implausible"".... they're probably the same people who think that silly IMPOSSIBLE fantasies like X-Men, King-Kong, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, etc, etc were great movies. At least the characters and events in Lake House are believable, once the basic premise is accepted. Can't say that about drivel like X-Men.See this film with someone you love. You'll both like this film.",The Lake House
260,nightbreed303,"Fine, except the ending kills the movie.",6,9 December 2011,"I suspect that some test audience didn't like an ending where Alex (Reeves) dies... well, for the plot to have made any sense he should be dead, not saved by some wretched scripting. Ironically, in keeping him alive the script finally self-destructs. Also that tree grew pretty fast in the space of two years - Reeve's character plants a sapling in O4 and in 06 it's fully grown. Perhaps the tree had a time machine too. Yes, the book too... the thing was large and how would it fit in the mailbox? Thing is the movie was quite engaging for 98% of it, but the 2% of ludicrous ending could leave you feeling short-changed. A disservice to anyone who gave up their willing suspension of disbelief and ignored the inconsistencies and incongruities. Luckily I didn't, since I figured there's no way Hollywood would pick a realistic ending over a happy ever after.",The Lake House
261,niniel_nienory,lost in translation,6,23 August 2006,"I saw Il Mare (the Korean film, which inspired Lake House) over a year ago during my Eastern Asian cinematography classes. My colleagues were fascinated by the beautiful sceneries and the finely-crafted script which managed to place so many details on screen without actually confusing any of them. So, naturally, I was curious to see if Hollywood could successfully re-make a truly Asian movie without taking away the subtle melancholic beauty of the original. The Lake House has all the ingredients of a successful (though perhaps a bit typical) romantic comedy. You won't miss the heart-touching moments, the lyrical music and the romantic settings. What makes Lake House less sugary than the usual comedy is the lovely mixture of Asian and Western aesthetics. What I really liked were some small Western touches to the Asian script (like Persuasion, Dostoyevski, western architecture) and the focus on the relationship between the main character and his father. Still, I felt like something was missing. The remake fails to preserve the mysterious romantic atmosphere of the original, unfolding the story only too directly on the screen. Just like the lake house itself, the film is beautiful (some would say a masterpiece), but remains too cold and distant to evoke emotion. Perhaps the movie just got lost in translation.",The Lake House
262,Mikie1974,A nice piece of non-summer blockbuster fare,10,9 July 2006,"This is not a movie of blockbuster proportions. It is a love story that transcends time. The visual effects are just right; they do not overpower the story and serve the CGI purpose, to enhance the look of the film. The Lake House is the story of a doctor who finds herself in the midst of a love affair with a man who is living two years behind her in the house that she has recently given up to move to downtown Chicago.The story fits Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves perfectly. Keanu stands out as an architect who chooses the less complicated life of a real estate developer. His performance was subtle and charming without being over the top. I was pleasantly surprised to see two Hollywood A-listers that usually star in the big productions take on such a simplistic story. The supporting performances, including Christopher Plummer, Dylan Walsh and Shohreh Aghdashloo, are wonderful as well.The only problem with the film is one which all continuity buffs will catch. Whenever a character is referring to the current year in a scene, the dubbing reveals that the film was almost two years old at the time of release. Sandra Bullock is the worst offender; our ears hear 2006, but our eyes read her lips as 2004. It's a small thing to endure and does not relocate the film to my thumbs down list.For those who enjoy a lite, romantic fantasy, this film is a pick for you. For those of you who like Keanu and Sandra in a action packed film, rent Speed and be done with it.",The Lake House

The plot is great, the characters are vivid and you are almost living their drama...but there are so many plot holes that you can get a nightmarish headache. If just someone had put a little more effort in writing the script, this movie would have turned a whole lot better. I mean, everybody knows that this can't really happen - but even if it can't, make it look like it could. Make the movie seem realistic. Make it look like you aren't only trying to tell a ''love story'' but also a story worth making you think. All in all, the only good reason to watch this is because your girlfriend/wife tells you to.

Some things are timeless, others are not. How can we know for sure?There's so much to love about this movie. Sandra Bullock is lovely in this serious role, with just enough of her wry humor from time to time while Keanau Reeves is simply irrestible - strong, vulnerable, unabashedly loyal, but never, ever a wimp. This is one of those movies that you want to watch over and over and never tire of, if just gets better wtih time.",The Lake House

There was nothing endearing about this film or the lackluster characters, I watched it until the end but regret doing so. Just Sayin', fair warning for fans of Bullock & Reeves and Alternate Dimension Sci-Fi. This attempt at combining ""You've Got Mail"" with the ""X-Files"" just doesn't work here.

266,MsKristi,The Talented Mr. Reeves,8,25 June 2006,"This film is a classic romance. I was emotionally wrapped up in it and, by film's end, was crying - though I won't tell you if they were tears of happiness or sadness. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have the kind of chemistry that makes you think you could watch them together in any number of romantic films and never get sick of seeing them opposite one another...you think you would just be left longing for more. Perhaps it was this powerful chemistry alone that made it so very easy to suspend disbelief. I want to give very deserving kudos to Reeves. His acting has greatly improved. There was nary a hint of that Valley Boy speak. That woodenness has been whittled away. This is not the same leading man from Sweet November and A Walk In the Clouds. This leading man has more depth, more range, more passion. I hope this is the start of a wonderful trend for Mr. Reeves. The one thing that I will complain about is the cinematography. Was it the director's decision to have the cinematographer film some very emotional scenes with the actors' backs facing the camera? I kept trying to convince myself that this was done for artistic purposes...you know, make the viewer feel the frustration that the characters feel in not being able to see and feel each other. Well, I lost that argument with myself because it just flat out annoyed me that during one big scene, most of what I saw was their backs or the side of one of their faces. It was like I was being robbed of something and that made those special moments in the film a little less special. Aside from that, this was a very satisfying film. I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes a good love story, be it tragic or fairy tale. Along with Must Love Dogs, this is one of the best romances I have seen this decade.",The Lake House
267,alex979,Wonderful movie!,7,27 September 2006,"I loved every minute of this movie! Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves have such chemistry and are perfect together. Although the plot was a little confusing as to why they were living two years apart (Keanu's character is really dead??), it was a very interesting story and left me wondering if they would be together in the end (Not all romance movies end happily, you know!). Although a remake of the Korean film ""Il Mare"", the film was very unique. Christopher Plummer and Shoreh Aghdashloo are also very good as supporting roles to Kate (Bullock) and Alex (Reeves). This movie is definitely one of the best romance movies of 2006!",The Lake House

If your a film goer and liked or loved the movie the Sixth Sense---Then you will surely like this one. I like being teased and made to think while I watch a movie. I could not guess the ending, nor could I guess another part of the movie which totally shook me.

Picture the scene: ""Hey, Fred, this script has just landed on my desk. It's not Million Dollar Baby, but who cares?

It did a great job of taking the predictability out of what would normally be a formula film. BUt at the end just when you think the film would come together and end with a finite action leaving nothing to the imagination. This movie like so many other modern romance movies had the chance to be a tragedy that would have made audiences weep in the theatrs the way romeo and Juliet probably did to the audiences of that time period. But instead of being a movie that would be in the running for several Oscar nominations, we got a romance novel put on the big screen. This movie became a well budgeted lifetime film that deserved the daytime movie slot it usually would be played in. This film had two very good actors in my opinion, in Keanu Reaves and Sandra Bullock, but their talents and efforts through out the film were wasted by the Director who had the power to make or break this movie. He broke it because he was to afraid to break the barrier and made a movie that was anything but completely conform to the popular themes of the modern love story.",The Lake House
272,wamba7,Magic almost undone by Method,5,17 July 2006,"This is the first romance movie I have ever seen that requires a time line, so I will begin with The Idiot's Guide To The Lake House, a story of two people with a slight scheduling problem.Cast of characters:Alex Wyley, an architect who runs crews on a condo project Kate, a doctor who has just finished her residency Dad Wyley, the self-centered tyrant who designed and built the lake house Henry, Alex's brother, who takes a lot of crap from Dad, too Morgan, Kate's would-be white knight, were it not for the fact that he Places His Career FirstA Crudely Reconstructed Time Line1. Spring 2004 Alex moves into the lake house. 2. Spring 2006 Kate moves out of the lake house to take a position in a Chicago hospital. 3. (2004//6) Alex and Kate are able to correspond across time threads and discover themselves to be soul mates who share a dog in trans-time. They also share a mysterious mail box which serves as a time portal, also providing quicker-than-real-time delivery, reading, and response service through the little red flag.4. Kate, while discussing matters of the heart with her mom over lunch, has to rush to the aid of a man stricken in a traffic accident. 5.Alex, totally smitten, goes to Kate's birthday party and plants a steamy slow dance kiss on her unsuspecting mouth. 6. Kate, in a state of what we might call ""rational thought"", decides to call the whole trans-time thing off and demands that Alex cease corresponding. She returns to her old boyfriend, Morgan, who was never totally convinced that Kate and Alex had been discussing real estate at her party. But she looks great, even with short hair. 7. Dad dies. Nobody seems to mind. Now Alex can put down the hard hat and take up his true calling, architecture. 8.Alex goes to Morgan with the lake house key and tells him to give it to Kate (my bad: perhaps he was too upset to worry about fine details such as a lease, which might have contained his or his family's name).(arrow back to the blank space before item #2) 9. (2004: discarded instance) Kate moves into the lake house, but now she is somehow unaware of Alex's existence - no, wait. We don't see this part, but presumably the dog does, and maybe she does tech support for the script writers, too. (Arrow back to the blank space after item #3) 10. (2006: really) Kate, putting several realizations together, perhaps more slowly than the average doctor might have, is now aware that the dying man in the traffic accident was Alex, who she had told where she was on Valentine's Day of this year. 11. You think I'm giving this away? You must not have been wearing a hard hat! 12. The End (see item #10 for foreshadowing).As you might have surmised, this film, while poetic and romantic in spirit, is grimly literal-minded in its method, and the combination doesn't wear all that well. A bit more mystery or a touch of indirection and vagueness might have better conveyed the magical mood the story needed. The actors knock themselves out, even Reeves, who has often seemed to care less what day it was or even what movie he was in - here he seems passionately focused, if awkward at times.And the director, despite his earnest determination to show how many calendar days apart the characters are in almost every scene, shows at times that he really does understand the mystery of romantic passion. The Jane Austen references toward waiting for the right person, the walking architectural tour given by Alex, and that sweet slow dance, all show the precious blend of spiritual and physical connection that can weld two beings together in a moment. If only we had been given more of this...(and I hated The Notebook, too, dude!)(For the record, this appears to be the first English language film by Argentine director Alejandro Agresti. I'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt and check out his earlier films, such as Un Mundo Menos Peor, as well as his coming projects).",The Lake House

The Fantasy genre of this movie becomes apparent almost from the start, but unfortunately the movie (for me) wasn't pieced together right or something. It just didn't work.Bullock and Reeves work well together, however, their performances are 'regular' at most, i.e., nothing out of the norm for either. All in all, I think the story could've weaved together much better. It was an OK movie (maybe wait for DVD). Sometimes it appeared as if the story were about to end but then moved on; so was a bit slow at times. I enjoyed the music most maybe. When the soundtrack is available I will likely want to purchase a copy. Recommendation: Wait for DVD",The Lake House
274,dhavaludani,Love can transcend all boundaries  even the small matter of time,8,2 December 2006,"The Lake House is a beautiful story which stresses the point that love can transcend all boundaries  even the small matter of time. It's a story about how two human beings in two parallel universes' can not only communicate with each other but also fall in love. Einstein will be smiling in his grave.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock return as a pair for the first time since the high-drama of Speed in this remake of a Korean movie by the name of ""Il Mare"". But speed is the last word on your mind as you sit through this slow love story which drifts its way and slowly settles in your heart. It's a tale of two individuals who find love in each other despite being two years apart and having a mailbox as the only mode of communication. While the story and many of the scenes seem to be extremely illogical and senseless, if you can get past it and accept the basis of this movie, the art of story telling comes to the fore. Whatever the story, if one knows how to tell it, the outcome is assured to be a piece of art. Some of the scenes are a work of brilliance and truly entertaining specially the one where Kate (Sandra Bullock) and Alex (Keanu Reeves) communicate with each other via a mailbox whose flag keeps going up and down as they write and read each others messages. The blossoming of love is shown quite metaphorically as Alex plants Kate's favorite tree outside her yet to be built house in winter minus all its leaves and Kate to her surprise sees a tree in full bloom. Communication between the two takes place through notes (dropped in a mailbox at the lake house) which is woven into the storyline through voice overs by the lead actors. The brilliance in this movie is the manner in which the director takes us from Kate's world into Alex's without a break and makes us feel as if they co-exist. The surroundings of the suburb of Chicago make for a wonderful backdrop and are truly pleasing to the eye. The chance appearances of Alex in Kate's world are subtle and at deliberate moments; which you could almost miss out if you are not alert.The lake house is a glass house built on stilts. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), a doctor by profession, is the resident of this lake house who is now moving into the city and requests the new owner of the lake house to forward all her mail to her new address. The recipient of this message is Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a young architect looking to build his own niche separate from his fathers. When he tries to forward her mail he is told that the address does not exist and is yet under construction. Here begins a tale of intrigue and mystery for Alex (and one of illogical scripts for the spectator) who is at a loss to understand how he is to forward mail to a non-existing address. So he does the next best thing. He admits his predicament and drops it into the post box at his lake house. Meanwhile Kate while wondering what happened to her mail decides to go back to the lake house and is greeted by Keanu's reply. This is a wonderful scene where they both realize that in reality Kate is actually two years in the future.Here begins a tale of discovery for Alex. He wants to know how things are in the future""they really have'nt changed.."" is what Kate has to reply back. All this while the post box is their sole method of communication. Funnily enough Alex doesn't want to know the prices of stocks and results of games! Here is when the art of story telling rises above the storyline. They realize that each of them have crossed the others parts in the past in different ways. There are some truly memorable moments as Kate asks Alex to retrieve her most precious possessions, a copy of Persuasion given to her by her father. Herein lies one of the most amazing moments wherein Kate tells him that the books tells that love can occur at the wrong moments and even if the characters wait, it does'nt work outAlex's father, a renowned architect built the lake house as a family getaway. Alex, eager to carve his own niche and do something different moves in here as he develops a property nearby. He comes into contact with a lawyer (Kate's boyfriend at that time) and is asked over for drinks. By this time Alex is deeply in love with the Kate of two years hence. He is the result of her breakup. Kate of course has no inkling that she will fall in love with this man two years hence. The first time they decide to meet in Kate's world (through an unconfirmed two year reservation at a fine dine Chicago restaurant!), Alex fails to turn up. Both of them are confused as to why it happened only to realize a greater calamity had occurred.The present and past are woven together beautifully to form one continuous thread. While Keanu and Sandra play their roles to perfection there is no doubt that this movie belongs to the director and the director alone. There are two alternate endings this movie could have had. I am sure the director must have considered both. I believe the alternate ending would have left a much more lasting impact on the mind of the viewer.",The Lake House

It swept me away and from beginning to end I was holding my breath. I laughed, I cried, and almost screamed a couple of times.

This is a bad thing, because I got my hopes up.""The Lake House"" is a horrible movie. Not even Sandra Bullock, who I consider one of the most amazing and talented actresses of all-time, could save it. It's slow, it feels about four hours long, and the ending is terrible. No matter how ""magical"" a movie is, you NEED to explain why things work like they do. No explanation is given to WHY they are able to communicate between two different times. Also, the ending (which I won't give away) - YOU can't change something if it already happened and just expect the whole world to change accordingly when you are ALREADY in the future. Had Kate gone back in time, I could understand it. But she stayed where she was and managed to change things.Right... how does that work, exactly?Now, plot holes aside, I have another complaint - Keanu Reeves.

The best part of the movie for me was the many opportunities my friends and I had to laugh at him incessantly.I'll stop this now.

280,michellephillips,"a love that transcends the time space continuum, or something like that, I really was not sure, and later on I did not care.",1,18 June 2006,"This was an incredibly dumb movie. Although it is billed as a romance, the undeniable chemistry between the two leads is simply not enough to distract from all the plot holes in the film. Furthermore, nothing in the plot really convinced me for a second that these two folks had a reason for their love, or a love that would transcend the time space continuum for that matter. I knew the movie had failed to hold my interest when I found myself looking at my watch several times during this dull film, as well as incredibly aware that my seat was not very comfortable, need I say more? Although I like both lead actors, I found their performances to be less than compelling, ho hum about covers it. The reliable Christopher Plummer is wasted in this film, in a role that could have been omitted, and no one would have noticed. I would not recommend seeing this film. Even a large popcorn and a box of Milk Duds would not make it bearable. If you are a die hard fan of the leads, then it is DVD rental material",The Lake House
281,mermaid131810,Absolutely Phenomenal,7,24 June 2006,"I truly enjoyed this film. It was very well done, the actors suited the parts perfectly. Sandra Bullock was beautiful and the creators of the film chose some familiar actors to relate to the parts well. But the story was FABULOUS. The only reason I didn't feel it deserved a 9 or 10 was that it was extremely hard to understand, or not understand, but fathom. It's complicated with the time and such and if you can explain this movie, please try for me because I truly could not understand how the lead characters could write to each other but not see each other and how the end happened. But the parts that I did get out of it was really very interesting and it kept me hooked the whole time. Me+sappy anything=not OK because I think females should be strong and independent and do not need a man but this movie did not portray that women can't take care of themselves without relying on a man however this was truly wonderful. A must-see.--Camille (13)",The Lake House
282,socialgal5,"Adorable, confusing, and lovable all at the same time!",7,17 July 2007,"""The Lake House"" tells two stories really. First is that of young doctor Kate Forster, who struggles to endure the hardships of working in a hospital. Then, there's the story of Alex Wyler, a young contractor who is living in a lake house made entirely of glass. In his mailbox, he finds a letter from a woman who said she previously lived in the house. She tells him to forward any mail that might come through and also that she's sorry about the paw prints by the door. Also, she writes the date wrong. She writes it two years in the future. As Alex and Kate begin writing letters back and forth, they realize that they are living two years apart. Slowly, they realize that they are falling in love as they constantly write letters back and forth. Will they ever be able to meet or will they stay two years apart forever? The way this movie resolved never made sense to me, but I still loved it and bought it. It's so sweet and the kiss between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves is hot!!! Kudos to them!",The Lake House
283,all560,The Role she was born to play,10,19 April 2007,"Don't try to rationalize the framework of the plot. These type films exist - have always existed - for a reason: they allow for the development of an intensity that is often awkward to achieve on film.I think Cecil Kellaway said it best in Portrait of Jennie, ""...there ought to be something timeless about a woman..."" Lake House is the reward for those of us who have continued to watch Sandra Bullock through some pretty awful films during the past decade, never knowing quite why.From the moment when Kate sits, alone on her birthday, in a Chicago bar, Lake House changes. Gone are the cloying, stereotyped characterizations of almost all ""romantic"" films of the recent past, including the first 45 minutes of this one! In a few moments, Kate comes to life. She realizes what every human being is meant to realize, and she devotes herself to fulfilling that realization. The facade is gone. And that is the point of this type of film.From that moment on, Sandra Bullock simply glows. Both she and Keanu Reeves rise above anything they've ever done, and - for an all-too-brief hour - they create magic.For those lucky enough to have that magic in real-life, the effect is simply beautiful.For those who are not...well...the wait is worth it!",The Lake House
284,rachellucky,awful,1,27 June 2006,"I love these actors. However, I could not make heads or tails of the plot/story. Saw it with my mom, also a big fan, and 3/4 of the way in, we both asked each other: do you know what is going on? It made no sense. I never felt an emotional connection between the two main characters. Odd, since they have had great chemistry in the past. The movie is disjointed, lacks continuity & flow. The story moves very slowly, never really explaining the why they live in different times, or how this issues has a resolution. I was very disappointed, as I thought this would be the romantic movie of 2006. I strongly suggest you spend your movie dollar elsewhere.",The Lake House
285,rox-33,"A very enjoyable, interesting movie",8,17 July 2006,"Saw this movie about 2 weeks ago and thought it was very enjoyable. Well acted by Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and had an interesting yet impossible storyline which always kept you thinking all the way through about what possibilities could occur. Keanu buys a lake house in 2004 and finds a note in the mailbox from Sandra saying she'd moved out and was asking for mail to be forwarded to her new address. The strange thing is Sandra lives in 2006, therefore Keanu could try and meet Sandra in his own time of 2004 but she wouldn't know who he is, get it ???? Good cause I don't :) Anyway their only form of communication is via notes in the mailbox, and the story becomes a challenge of how, if and when (as in what year) their paths can meet. I must admit at times my brain had gone in full circle as i was trying to calculate if certain situations were possible. But overall it was a very nice movie and well worth watching, and if you like a bit of romance you wont be disappointed, especially as Sandra is looking so damn fine :) I saw it twice and liked it as much the 2nd time round, even made a few things clearer, but a few things unclearer too :) that sort of movie.",The Lake House
286,jonpuck,Sexier than email,7,30 December 2006,"What a completely delightful surprise this movie is. This has to be the best romance flick of 2006. It's the story of Alex and Kate who live in the same lakeside house, but two years apart. They soon start communicating through letters left in the mysterious 'time portal' mailbox and, of course, they fall in love. Oh yeah, and they have the same dog. They accept all this with amazing speed, and the script blissfully avoids any explanations as to how or why it is happening. My first theory was that it was all caused by the dog, but after that I just gave up and went along with it. Basically it's a sort of ""You've Got Mail"" with time travel.Personally, I just love Keanu Reeves. I could watch him walk on screen and read the telephone book (even though you cynics think that's what his acting most resembles!). He has a unique presence that adds depth to any role he takes on. Sandra Bulloch is also particularly charming here.There are some wonderful little touches from Argentinian director Alejandro Agresti and the cinematography and art direction are also just right, with clever use of colour to emphasize mood.Leave any grumpy rationalism you may have at the door, and enjoy the ride.",The Lake House

I loved Sandra Bullock's acting in this film, i have always loved her acting. Keanu Reeves gave a pretty good performance, I have to admit I was pretty surprised. It is a cute love story and not what I expected. The lake house in the movie is beautiful as well, I have to say that because it's just amazing. The movie gives you this feeling that there's something beyond the things we see everyday. It makes you think that there just might be something waiting for you that you don't even know about. It is definitely a chick flick but guys just might like it as well. It's definitely worth seeing, and even buying. It was an overall good movie.",The Lake House

Sandra Bullock is amazingly beautiful and dazzling self as always and Keanu Reeves has done a pretty good job too. When i was watching this movie it got a little predictable in the starting but what surprised me was the ending.(I am not gonna spoil it). The movie tells about a secret loop or a tunnel through Time using which two people connect.The tale of two people falling in love against time is a very new concept for a movie and the directors of the movie have done a hell of a job depicting it, it's like i am sitting right there and going through everything.However some people did not find this movie entertaining but that's there personal choice and if you like movies at all you will love this one.

I loved everything about this movie, even the songs during certain scenes, they seemed to match perfectly with the situation like for example the song, ""This never happened before"", it gives you a sense of reality to the unreal feeling of the whole movie.

The film cleverly tugs your heart strings and make you pine for Sandra and Keanu's characters to be together. I did find it a little hard to get my head round at some points but I understood most of it; what the story was trying to tell you. I looked up some questions I still didn't understand (minor details) and they were easily solved so you don't need to worry about little things being wrong- it is just a little confusing!I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling anything but I highly recommend you to watch this film.

294,Hambonator,A touching story...,10,3 August 2006,"Firstly, the formalities outta the way... I rather enjoyed this film. It's premise has strong elements of fantasy, which, combined with a decent romantic story, is just up my alley. I akin the film to something of a hybrid between Kate & Leopold, Serendipity, and Sleepless In Seattle. The story revolves around a remarkable Lake House, or more specifically, it's enchanted mailbox... which, through a series of coincidental events, becomes a liaison between two 'lonelyheart' thirty-something professionals.Sandra Bullock plays an emergency room Physician, and Keanu ""Whoa!"" Reeves plays a condominium Architect. At the heart of the story, as in any good romantic fare, is a well worn theme of longing. What gives this movie it's own twist, and ultimately, it's fantasy element, is that the two pen-pals-cum-would-be-lovers are separated through the expanse of space and time.Bullock writes her letters from the present time(2006), and Reeves, is replying to her from the same day, only 2 years in the past. Whilst it may sound a little convoluted, what comes from the clever twist is in essence, a touching chemistry. As the two protagonists narrate their letters back and forth. Bullock does as good a job as I've ever seen her do... and Keanu, well, he's Keanu... Okay so he's no Eric Roberts, but I ask you, WHO IS! The Lake House does not break new ground, as far as this genre goes. When is comes down to it, love is still love, and this film tugs on most of the familiar heart-strings. However, what sets this story apart, is it's fantasy twist, it's honest 'heart', and it's deeper messages to the audience(which of course, will vary for each individual). For me, this film dealt with the notion of finding something beautiful and true, and believing in it... even if it does come through a magic mailbox. My only problem with The Lake House, is that the ending is perhaps a little too 'Hollywood'... I'll leave it at that.A word of warning though, to those who do intend on seeing it... you will have to shift the olé grey matter out of neutral for a spell. As the film does inter-twine the two time-frames throughout... and discerning which part is when, can make keeping up with the story, mildly challenging. All in all, I'd rate The Lake House as a definite Budget Tuesday special... one to take your mum, or a significant other to.",The Lake House
295,silby1867,Try it you'll like it!,9,14 June 2007,I love intriguing films and this was one of them. I didn't give the time difference a thought. I am not interested in how they could communicate over a 2 year gap. My only concern was how they were going to get together or indeed if they were going to get together. Sandra Bullock & Keanu Reeves gave two sensitive performances. I had forgotten that they had been together before in Speed. They did a great job. The dance in the garden was more moving and revealing than any of the naked humping we usually see when filmmakers try to show the audience that the couple are in love. I loved this film. It was tender and gentle. Filmmakers need to take note of these comments and give us more intellectual fare like this.,The Lake House
296,Moe8604,Not for me.,2,20 June 2006,"The Lake House is a film that puts the Speed duo of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock together. The couple share a lake house, they write to each other, but they're two years apart. They devise schemes to meet each other, but they never really pan out. There's some stuff about a dog, they're dads, and lots of architect jargon.I found myself checking my watch about 40 minutes in and was sickened by the fact that it had been ONLY 40 minutes. The plot is unbelievably slow. There's a crap load of really cheesy voice-overs. Oh man. Even the ""twists"" can be seen from miles away.Sure, there are some fundamental problems with this film; there's time-travelish stuff, the time lines are a bit off, etc. Yet, the most unbelievable element to this story was the fact that these folks had such a ""love"" based on pure letter writing. As one character states, ""That must be one hell of a letter.""As far as the visual elements, they weren't terrible. There were some odd zooms and bad angles, but it seems like the director was trying for a bit more and failed.So here's the facts if you don't feel like reading the whole thing...or you need closure: The plot is way to slow, the movie is pretty much totally unbelievable, and the direction was a bit off. If I could write a letter that would somehow deceive time and make it to someone, I'd tell the producers to avoid this mess by any and all means.2/10",The Lake House

Cliché after cliché after cliché, pompous, stilted dialogue, the always horrible ""acting"" of Keanu Reeves. I spent the whole movie waiting for something novel, something surprising, something inventive to happen, but it was not to be. Trite, unimaginitive, downright boring story coupled with an astoundingly simple minded predictability makes this a total waste of time. Christopher Plummer, the only real actor in this film is obviously phoning it in, and every plot ""turn"" can be seen from a mile away.

I was very surprised that I was still watching it after 20min of play. Things in the movie started to intrigue me and the more I watched the more involved in the movie I became.The premise of the movie is just awesome.

The only difference in this movie is the 2 people found true love.The plot is very thick, but very easy to grasp and understand...even a simple mind like myself. There are no holes in this movie, witch is very hard to do considering on what the whole movie was about.The acting that was in this movie was great The chemistry between all the characters made it even more believable and probable. There were times I felt like I was not watching the movie but was right there with the actors and not watching the movie at home.This is a great romance and love story for the ages.

If he met her in the past why he didn't just try to make her fall in love with him in the past ? And at the end of the movie, why did he wait another two years?

305,dchasegr,I hadn't laughed so hard since I saw Dumb and Dumber,1,20 June 2006,"Seriously. I tried to contain myself, but from the very first moment of this film, everything about it was so terrible that it made me and my date laugh uncontrollably. Either I am completely out of touch with society or society has just completely lost it. As the credits rolled, the audience applauded! I looked around stunned as if I were in the middle of a Twilight Zone episode. How could this be? Well, I'll tell you. Hollywood has not produced a great movie in this genre in ages. Believe me when I tell you this, NOTHING in this movie is good. Maybe the dog. Okay, I'll give the dog credit. But you know what? Even the dog wasn't as cute or even as adorable as other classic film dogs. We all knew going into this film that Keanu wasn't going to impress with his acting. But Sandra Bullock provided absolutely nothing. In fact, aside from the dog, there was no member of this cast that provided a good performance. Everything was laughable. In particular, the actor who plays Keanu's brother. Every time he makes an appearance in this movie it looks as if he's going to cry. The idea that you can communicate with someone years apart through a mailbox is preposterous. They knew this was so absurd, the filmmakers didn't even try to explain it.Another thing...this movie so far has a better rating than Frequency (starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel) on IMDb. How is that possible? Frequency has a similar premise in that the two main characters are separated by 30 years, but are communicating through a ham radio. In this film, they talk about how this is possible, they even show us through visual effects. So we can suspend our disbelief and go with it. Frequency has a compelling story and it moves. You want to know what happens next.In The Lake House, the only reason you'd want to know what happens next is so you can get the hell out of the theater. I will say this, I actually enjoyed the experience because I hadn't laughed that hard since I saw Dumb & Dumber.

Okay, that's not exactly true. But he was not impressed by the trailers and was not excited by what he thought the movie had to offer... the point being; he really enjoyed it. In fact, he gave it a higher score than I did and I really liked it. At times, I find Keanu Reeves difficult to watch ... okay, I won't go there. But the plot in this movie was so twisted and fun to follow that I was able to overlook any flat acting by Keanu and at times he was fairly believable (which is really saying something, given this surreal plot). Sandra was a natural. This is a movie that requires concentration to keep the story line straight (at least it did on my part) but wraps it all up beautifully, in the end!

It had been moved into one of the mini-theaters in the complex, but that made the film just a little more intimate rather than taking away from it. I was more than pleased with The Lake House. It was well written and well acted.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have a wonderful chemistry on screen, even though they spend so little time together in this one. The supporting actors are well cast, too. It's always a pleasure to see Christophe Plummer. Forget the quibbling over the time displacement issue. It's only a piece of the furniture.

308,bumble-7,Not a movie for actual Architects,3,26 June 2006,"I was tempted to walk out of the movie theater after watching Keanu Reeves ""act"" after the first few minutes of this movie. I even whispered that it seemed as if he was a high school student performing in his first play. Keanu plays an architect and, in the beginning of the movie, is busy walking around a job site telling the contractor which part of the foundation to pour next and how to shuffle workers around to get the job moving faster. Right, like an architect on condominium projects has that much control over the construction process. I couldn't believe how incongruent the writer's and director's view of architecture was with reality. It only takes about 5 minutes to research how architects really work and all you have to do is, at the very least, step into an architect's office. There were lots of drafting boards shown, but no computers in the offices shown. Hollywood's take on architectural theory made me want to vomit. The movie would have been a lot better without the pretentious and incorrect architectural sub-plot.

I mean how many movies have a magical mail box, that acts like a instant messenger?? hehe. I'm totally jealous. You just want this to be real when you see it. You fall in love with the characters, and how their lives keep connecting. Take anyone you care about to see this film. This film is particularly unique! See it!!!",The Lake House
312,grettagreen,A very imaginative love story,8,20 June 2006,"I thought this movie was very well done, both by the production staff and the actors. After seeing Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock together in Speed, (which is another great movie...) I was more than a little curious to see if they could pull off a dramatic romance. I'm very happy to tell you that they did, and did it well. This is the first movie of the season that uses a pretty original premise, which is unheard of in this era of bad remakes and TV shows to the big screen. This is a great movie that I've already seen twice, and can't wait until it comes out on DVD. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, especially romantic comedies, and this one will definitely be added to my collection. Through the drama, the characters still manage to make you chuckle occasionally. I kept waiting for them to hop on a bus or for Keanu Reeves to say ""Whoa."", and thankfully, neither happened. Give this one a chance, it's a great movie with a lot of heart.",The Lake House
313,attales,A wonderful romantic non-fiction story!,7,21 June 2006,"I don't think anyone was expecting this movie to blow anyone out of the water. So when I saw it I wasn't expecting it to be an amazing movie, but I was surprised that the movie did not end up being a complete waist of time.The Lake House is filled with two actors that always do a wonderful job, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. The Lake House was well thought out, well written, and well acted. With this movie you will sometimes be confused and maybe even bored, but you wont be disappointed.Now when I say confused some people might not be confused, but do not fell bad if you are confused because a lot of people were. Now when I say bored you might not be bored if you like following sometimes slow characters, who's friends and family are more exciting than they are. Now don't get me wrong this was a good movie it just does not fulfill its potential. If we were to see more of the other characters, than this movie would be an A+, but it just isn't.Bottom line there are better movies out there, but this movie would be on my to see list. I will have to give this movie a C+!",The Lake House

The only time i felt any emotion was near the end when it appeared like a tragic (but very predictable) ending was coming up. Alas, being a typical chick flick, they just had to end it shockingly happy.I find Keanu Reeves to be pretty deadpan and plain so I started off not expecting much of an emotional attachment. Sandra, on the other hand, was great. Shame about everything else.This movie was beyond predictable, the second I saw that crash in the beginning it became so amazingly obvious who died in her arms. I didn't really find the whole scenario to be believable as neither of them appeared that surprised or shocked that they seemed to have found a time portal. I felt like I was the only one who found that situation a little bit strange? It was a good idea for a movie, but a bit to bland and shallow to keep me entertained for long.",The Lake House

I think this is poor writing and leaves me feeling frustrated and unresolved.

There are other broken points like this. A real shame - great actors!",The Lake House
316,wally7,Typical Keanu Reeves...,1,30 November 2006,"I shouldn't need to say anymore than that, Typical Keanu Reeves. How does this guy continue to work as a successful actor? How does he get roles in movies opposite Al Pacino, Lawrence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, etc.? How does 95% of the American female population remain captivated by an ""actor"" who may be easy on the eyes, but couldn't hold his own in a high school drama club? Kathy Ireland may be hot, but the first time you hear her speak you think ""why couldn't you just stay on the pages wearing the swimsuit?"" Same for Keanu, just hearing him speak makes the sound of nails on a chalkboard seem like the New York symphony. And pair him with one of the worst actresses of our time (Sandra Bullock) and you have unbelievably horrible cinema.As far as the movie goes, it may have been slightly entertaining with people who could act. As it were, it had me wishing I had some paint to watch drying within the first 5 minutes. My wife actually talked me into watching this garbage instead of a football game. 20 minutes later, she asked me if we could watch the game instead...she couldn't stand this movie either. If you are a human being, with a brain, don't waste your time, money, and sanity trying to watch this. Keanu Reeves will forever be Ted ""Theodore"" Logan, and nothing more!",The Lake House
317,gttnmyphd,Not bad.,6,23 January 2007,"Mr. Reeves has had a very interesting career. I wonder if being in Bill and Ted set the wrong tone for him early on because he's done some very challenging work, yet still gets tagged as the empty headed surfer dude. In THE LAKE HOUSE he comes across very much like the character he played in Something's gotta give with Diane Keaton. The love story between him and Sondra Bullock actually reads well in many parts. And it's not just all her. I think it's his eyes that really come across. There sort of hurt puppy dog eyes. And I truly believed him to be a construction worker this movie...which is amazing to me regarding my prior notions about him.I thought the concept was fascinating as well, although, at times it felt very much like a stage play. I did predict that pat ending pretty early on, but still enjoyed it as a nice light ROM drama.",The Lake House

They found out they connected by the mailbox.

320,tilted_splash,One of the BEST Modern Romances,10,19 June 2006,I have seen movies in the past that have explored this scenario. But this one I think really takes it to a whole other level. Sandra was wonderful as always and I believe this was Keanu's best film. He really took this one and made it his own. The way it was filmed was just beautiful. The scene in the cafeteria when he's writing to her about his father and then she fades in on the other side of the screen to answer him is just wonderful. It makes you wonder if they're actually talking to each other or not. There are films and then there are films...this one was definitely a work of art just like the latest version of Pride and Prejudice. You can always tell when there is a lot of love and attention is put into a movie. I look forward to seeing more films done in this same fashion in the future. I look forward to it and I also crave it.,The Lake House

The characters work, the premise works( allow 1 large suspension of disbelief) and you end up with an entertaining little film that allows for a couple hours escape. Can't tell you about the one little plot thing that may be slightly off without giving something away. May not be anything at all, would have to see it again to be sure. Did miss Jack at one point though. Even allowing for that one suspension of disbelief, it was a fun ""watch"". Who said all films have to be ""masterpieces"" whatever that is.

I thoroughly enjoyed it till the very end.The hold of the movie is so very captivating that not for a single second did I let my attention wander (barring one exception at the beginning).Everything about the movie is so damn good I tell you that there is no chance of you not loving it.. The plot in itself (as I said at the very beginning) is of the type never heard or seen before (in fact never wondered of earlier too ..!) Then the direction or cinematography as some like to call it, is simply outstanding. Then the fabulous performances by both stars,i.e., Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock deserves some serious but generous praise. Then the way the entire movie locations have been chosen, it is so very beautiful.... Gosh,simply amazing. I really feel that it one of those beautiful movies that have been hugely underrated.The only thing that tricked me was the ending, I mean I couldn't connect to it to be honest but then that's not such a big issue with any sci-fi, is it? I feel like watching it all over again right now...Hehehe getting a little carried away but that's truth coming out straight of the head without any adulteration or correction, so you gotta excuse me for that. All in all, another fabulous Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves movie.Man you gotta watch it, if you could refrain from using too much logic for a couple of hours, I bet you're undoubtedly gonna have a memorable time or if I may dare say, a lifetime experience.Though, I may have exaggerated slightly but then it's far more preferable than underrating such a lovely movie..!",The Lake House
323,zterry2,Don't worry about the time/Possible spoilers,9,18 June 2006,Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock were matched perfectly for the roles. Was an interesting twist for a romance that takes the viewer to the end before they understand the time distance. You get to laugh and you get to cry on this feel good journey. It was great to see a love story with older people for a change. It is sad that most romance movies are filled with young actors aimed at a young movie going crowd. I saw the trailers for this a month or so ago and made it a point to be sure I would see it opening weekend. I'm glad I did. The other viewers I could sense as myself were really relating to the couple falling in love through there letters and notes. Some people can't figure out why the time riff. Well you have to be watching from the start of the movie to get the little clues the writers laid out for you.This is not a serious movie. It is one for you to enjoy and be happy as they are in finding out about themselves. The sound track was right on. Overall I rate this a 9 out of ten. There were some small flaws.,The Lake House

By the end, I definitely felt like I'd seen a good movie (enjoyable if not Oscar-material, but hey, it never pretended to be). Anyway, I had tears in my eyes (okay, and on my cheeks too) at the end; the movie got better and better as it went along, and yay for that because I paid $8.",The Lake House
325,dlgriffinb,definitely worth watching,10,29 December 2006,The Lake House is not your usual love story. It has to be the first story where I have actually sat and sniffled in a very long time. The reason that I like it so much is that it touched me in a romantic way but wasn't stupid or sappy. I especially liked the part where Alex and Kate are supposed to get together for a meal and Alex makes a reservation ahead of time. The look on the hostess' face is great and I couldn't help but wonder what she thought when Kate showed up. I could never see anyone but Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves in these parts as they are so right for them. I think that this movie is destined to be a classic as much as Casablanca.,The Lake House
326,ireland-6,I love a good story with excellent acting,10,18 June 2006,"Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were so sensitive in their acting, I could vicariously experience their joy, sorrows, regrets, frustrations, finding love, senses of losses and of finding new experiences.I really liked the House and Jack. I had a little problem following the way in which the film was edited, but I reminded myself that I came to enjoy a complicated and enchanting storyline. While I also think the director and the editors expected the viewers to be patient as the story unfolded, I was a little impatient about that, but in a way the passing of time seemed natural. My belief was suspended, and I was truly swept away. I loved the movie. I need to see it again and again to experience the joy it brought me. I am disappointed that the Studios (or maybe it was the local folks) didn't give this movie more advertising time. The television teasers were too few and not enough, though I realized I would like this movie. My kind of movie. Thanks everyone. Good job! ~SLI~ Charlottetown, PEI, CANADA",The Lake House
327,wandersfar,"Promising at first, but ultimately unsatisfying.",4,25 June 2007,"This could have been a really good movie. If only they hadn't cast Keanu Reeves (whose delivery was downright painful to listen to) as the male lead and...*SPOILER ALERT* ... if only they had had the balls to kill off Alex at the end, the movie would have ventured out of the realm of escapist chick flick fluff and maybe would have been an interesting surrealist movie in the style of Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind or Abre Los Ojos.... okay, maybe not ESTSM/ALO level, but it would have been a lot better than it was.Yeah, the plot was... odd, to say the least, and I guessed the ending from the moment we saw the back of Alex's jacket in the first bus scene, but I still think it would have made a pretty decent film had it not been for Keanu's lackluster ""acting"" and the cheap cop-out of a resolution.I wonder if the book is any better.",The Lake House
328,firesosweetie,An excellent heart journey,10,17 June 2006,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves gives a superb performance as Alex Wiler. Warm-hearted and unassuming, Keanu brought tears to my eyes as he searched and tried to connect with the one person that he could love. Sandra Bullock captivates and takes control of the screen as she too, searches for love.Atypical of Keanu's other roles, The Lake House is a must see for Keanu fans far and wide.

Unlike in other love stories which use the premise,supporting actors as just an excuse to dunk the lead actors in some soppy situation with lots of background music,this movie goes beyond that. Alex Wyler(portrayed refreshingly by Keanu Reeves) is a frustrated architect who exchanges letters through a mysterious mailbox with Kate Forster who is a lonely doctor.The movie shows us their lives,How they are not content,like there is something missing...How Alex is frustrated with his father(played to the hilt by the highly underrated Christopher Plummer) who pushed his mother away yet he is not able to forget or forgive him...and how when Kate asks her mum why she didn't marry her first love,her mum says she left her first love to marry Kate's father so that she could grow up and ask her that question..and How Kate is insecure that she ll never find that special someone....even their individual professions are not mere facades,they contribute equally to how Kate and Alex bond.The conversations between Alex and his brother Henry and Kate with her colleague are also very warming. The whole time travelling thing that seems to be the plot is really incomprehensible and it really doesn't matter for we want to see Alex and Kate get together.The movie works because of its intelligent script,great music,beautiful photography and some very good acting from all the actors...Go watch this heart warming movie without bothering much about the time thingy....you ll not be disappointed.",The Lake House

I think it really shows what true love is: waiting for someone whom you haven't even met in person. quoting pluggedinonline.com-""More than anything, it's wonderful to watch as the main characters grow to love each other based on friendly conversation, not physical attraction or some personal agenda. Sandra Bullock was drawn to that, too, noting that the couple avoids ""the superficial song and dance that always happens when people first meet and are trying to present their best side. ... Because of the unusual nature of the connection there's no embarrassment and no fear of sharing all of yourself because there's a part of you still saying, 'Well, this doesn't really exist,' or 'Even if it does, I'll never meet this person so what's to worry about?'

The scene where he cries had the folks behind me chuckling. That being said, David Auburn is a very good writer (I believe he wrote the play ""Proof""), and having John Cusack in the lead (the first choice) would've likely made this film much, much better. Editing is choppy and there are a bunch of continuity errors that become bothersome (e.g. Keanu mouthing ""2004"" when the audio says ""2006"" -- odd that this wasn't reshot).Most of the acting is very, very good with some excellent casting choices.

This could have been an 8, but became a 3 at best. One of the tragedies of modern Hollywood is having focus groups vote on movie endings. Although the IMDb info apparently did not mention whether or not this is the case, I'd wager more than the price of admission that this was an ending voted on by inept people who had just seen Dumb and Dumber, and loved it.

It's best if you don't over-analyze the time-travel details and just go with it... it's a movie, after all. Seriously, I wasn't expecting that much and I got a better feeling from this movie than I have in a long time - it made me feel warm and happy. Plus, the whole theater laughed at some parts, plus people gasped and cried, and at the end everyone applauded. That's a good sign, if you ask me. I don't watch previews so I don't know what they give away about the plot, so I'm not going to give much of anything away here. I will just say that to me this was a uniquely told romantic story. I happen to like Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, although they are by no means favorites of mine, nor do I consider them to be consistently amazing actors (more often they're not... at least he's not...). But they made this story work for me and I believe they have good chemistry. The movie is set in Chicago and shows the city off nicely without trying to beat you over the head with it (a la The Break-Up). One thing I think I related to a lot with these characters is that they are both pretty isolated and lonely, although not in a sad-sack way. I felt a longing from them for someone to relate to, and even though they have opportunities for other people to be involved in their lives... well it's not what's best for them and they don't settle.

I've seen countless romantic movies from all ages of film, and this one absolutely stands up well with the majority of the greatest of them.Don't believe the critics, I don't. I've been disappointed and angered by being suckered in to seeing movies I disliked or absolutely hated on many occasions, and with greater frequency recently. I haven't a clue what makes the critical media tick, and I'm not sure that they do either.This is very simply a lovely film on every level, from dialog, to direction, to cinematography, to consistently outstanding acting performances across the board. The delicately-embedded sheer decency of this film makes it a totally recommendable film for persons of all ages, although I'm guessing that most really young ones would get bored and fidgety before too long.Bullock's and Reeves' performances and chemistry here can be described in one word: luminescent. Please avoid coming into the theater with a bad attitude, that is seldom helpful in gaining enjoyment from quality film-making. Just don't be overly critical of what you may conceive as plot holes and inconsistencies. After all, the first and foremost goal of film is to entertain you. And entertained you will be, in the grandest fashion of great Hollywood cinema.I am deliberately refraining from specific description from the movie. Too many people are posting spoilers without warning here. But the chemistry is magical, the plot logical if entirely implausible, and the complete package is as satisfying as Hollywood is likely to provide.I came out of the theater thinking that this is the kind of movie that is seldom made anymore, but then I realized that it's the kind of movie that has seldom been made at any juncture in the history of film.An extraordinary effort, and a stunning success. Don't miss this one in the theater, because you'll later wish that you hadn't.

Very rarely do I see a film that I would recommend to others, but this is one of them. This movie reaches into the depths of one's soul in a way that most movies could never dream of. I did not recognize any of the music (except a voice I believe was Paul McCartney), but it was absolutely fitting and beautiful. The camera work, the scenes, the whole mood was simply astounding and refreshing! I know it takes some effort to fully understand the story (and I'm still not 100% there), but that's just one more reason to see it again. I'm sure this is a film that something new will be seen as well as realized with every viewing. I do not know how such a beautiful, refreshing movie would receive negative reviews, but it should be noted that to truly get this film's full potential, it should be viewed with an open mind.

I love the part when Alex asked Kate to take a walk with him and how at the end of the walk , he left a graffiti on the wall for her. The relationship that Kate and Alex shared is so out of this world and yet common that most of us have experienced or can see ourselves in (not the difference of time though).I laughed at their first fight through the letters and the two years time difference. It was funny and yet so romantic.I love the history behind the lake house(the actual house), somehow it represents the complicated but yet transparent relationship between a son and a father.The simplicity of the design and the transparent glass windows and the secluded area it was placed. It was an emotional part of the movie that all fathers and sons can relate to.The houses and the designs included in the movie were phenomenal.It was an educational experience to me and dwelling and deciphering at hidden meanings of the architectural design portrayed in the movie.Lastly, the soundtrack for the film is so melodious and pertinent for each scene that i will definitely go and buy it.

343,candace-37,Fun romantic movie,8,21 June 2006,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film a few months ago and thought it looked very interesting. Went to see it on opening night last week.First, the movie has a slightly languid pace to it. If you like you your romantic movies zipping along, you probably won't enjoy this. I think the pace was made to reflect that Kate and Alex are writing actual letters, something fewer and fewer people seem to do in our age of instantaneous e-mail and gratification. To me, a letter usually reflects thought and attention, whereas e-mail is essentially a post-it note. I love getting letters, and wish I got more.As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, especially the literary versions, which are SO much better than anything on film, I didn't notice any plot holes. For instance, the bit with the tree is like the trousers of time that Terry Pratchett talks about in his Discworld series.In quantum physics, everything that can happen does happen, all at the same time, and not until something is observed does it become fixed in time and space. For instance, there is a tiny remote possibility that the atoms in my sweater that I wear as I type this will all shift 5 feet left; in some reality, that does happen. (Wouldn't it be fun to visit that reality?) Back to our film; there were some things that I knew before they happened. When Alex's dog runs off and he gets invited to the party, I turned to my husband and said ""He's going to be the random stranger."" And right when Kate runs to the stranger hit in the square, I knew it was Alex because of the jacket he had on. I wasn't sure at that point whether I was in for a happy ending or a sad one. Let's just say I was satisfied with the resolution and leave it at that.As my husband and I left the theater, he turned to me and said, ""We'll have to get that one on DVD."" Ultimately, it's got more depth than some other romances I've enjoyed.Also, Christopher Plummer is the bomb!!!! Hopefully, we won't have to wait 12 years to see Reeves and Bullock on screen again; they do work very well together, far better than a lot of on screen couples in romantic comedies and romances.",The Lake House

345,salamimommy,One of the best movies I have seen.,10,24 June 2006,"I am still enjoying thinking about this movie three days after attending it. I went with several friends from work and we all agreed that the script was very well written. I expected the acting to be great and it was. I have already added this to my wish list for when it comes out on DVD. I hope it gets some award recognitions. The Lakehouse proves emotions can be projected on screen without bedroom scenes. I found myself comparing it to Somewhere In Time because it does deal with a time warp, which is very interesting to think about. A pleasant surprise was seeing Christopher Plummer, who played the father in The Sound of Music, still acting. All in all The Lakehouse was well written, well acted and very entertaining. Isn't that why we go to movies?",The Lake House
346,rosiek19,I Don't Get It!,6,3 July 2006,"I don't know if it was just me, but I totally did not understand this movie! I know Keanu Reeves character is in 2004, and Sandra Bullock's character is in 2006 and that they are two years apart in time. I knew I would have to pay attention to every single detail from the ""Feature Presentation"" to the end rolling credits. I was doing great, and didn't miss a thing - or so I thought. I don't understand how they met up at the mailbox at the end. I'm not degrading the movie. The chemistry between the two main characters was incredible, light humor was very well thought out, and it was overall an enjoyable movie. It just left me...perplexed!",The Lake House
347,finsfanintexas,Really Good Film,9,8 July 2006,"Fascinating story line but too much must be taken at face value to make this premise totally work. I had to keep my mind from asking questions. With that being said, Reeves and Bullock are great together and they were perfectly cast for this movie. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because it was slightly predictable in a few spots, but overall this film rocks and I enjoyed it. I also thought that they both too quickly accept a over the top experience with time warps at the beginning of the film that was beyond reason. Most people would have been freaking out or something, but they just keep going on like nothing out of the ordinary has happened. But that is really the only thing that really bothered me. I normally don't like sappy chick flicks, but this one easily avoids that while keeping a great romantic line going.",The Lake House
348,davidaplace-2,Did the dog Jack travel in the mailbox too?,9,26 September 2006,"This is a fantasy, and if you don't try to have all of it make sense, you can enjoy the movie. Lots of plot holes in the story... more about this later... but it was fun to watch Sandra, Keanu, and Christopher Plummer do their thing very well. Suspend your disbelief and go with it.A trend in the IMDb ratings seems to be that people who watched it soon after its theatrical release really liked the movie. Those who have watched it later seem to really not like it. With the DVD release in the US in the last week of September 2006, maybe the reviews will become more balanced. I will definitely put the Korean Il Mare on the list of movies to rent.If you allow for the mysterious conduit between the two years to be the mailbox, then the most glaring hole in the plot is what happens to their dog Jackie. Does the dog time travel in the mailbox, but not for the exactly two years the the letters time travel? Or does he just hang out in the forest? Why doesn't Alex come back to the house to look for Jack? If Alex has already rented the lake house to Kate, where he lost his dog, why doesn't he come out to the house to look for his pooch? On another level, how does a busy doctor doing 30 hour shifts get the time to travel way out to the lake house - a long drive - so frequently to carry on an inter-temporal correspondence with such frequency approaching Instant Messaging in its dialog-like banter? It's obvious that the writers haven't written a real handwritten love letter in long time, if ever. Clearly, artistic license, to keep the plot moving.",The Lake House
349,britneychia,"not the best romance movie ever, but it strikes a deep enough impression.",6,6 August 2006,"Now this is a time travel movie, although the title may have suggested a ""fishing"" theme.After a dozen years, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock pair up on screen once again, only this time they are connected in a more serene environment of a glasshouse by the lake. Although I am not particularly impress with these ""Speedsters"", I am surprise that both had delivered some screen chemistry in this one.The movie tells a lonely trainee Doctor, Kate (Sandra Bullock) exchanging love letters with an architect, Alex (Keenu Reeves) through a letterbox beside the Lake House. Soon they discovered that they are actually separated in time by two years  Alex lives in the year 2004 whereas Kate is in 2006.Now, I read that this is a western adaptation of a Korean romance movie, Ii Mare. I did not watch the Korean version, but THE LAKE HOUSE's script is so perforated. Telling a story, which toy with the time requires thorough detailing and if one is not careful, it could confuse and even frustrate the audience. Unfortunately for this movie, the scriptwriter(s) are so careless.Nothing was explained on how that letterbox could connect two people, living two years apart. Also, where Alex could have plenty of chances, from 2004 to 2006, to meet Kate and slowly explaining their supernatural relation, both only chance upon each other once within that time frame. What's really puzzling is that during their only meet, Alex chosen not to tell Kate anything was beyond many audience. Finally, I thought it would be reasonable if the finale were heartbreaking but the Hollywood formula does not allow that. As a result, the conclusion became illogical and unconvincing. Pardon me scriptwriters, I am sure audience nowadays are smarter than you think.This is not the best romance movie I ever watch, but still it strikes a deep enough impression.Commendable: Keanu Reeves P.S: I am hoping to see a different Sandra, unfortunately, she still that same old rugged eye-candy.",The Lake House
350,paperpusher75,I love this movie!,10,4 October 2006,"This moving is absolutely amazing! The way this movie made me feel while I was watching it is just indescribable. It truly touched me. The soundtrack was incredible too. My favorite scene in the entire movie is when they danced. There couldn't have been a better song selected than Paul McCartney's ""This never happened to me"". Just this scene alone brought me to tears. You really feel for Alex & Kate in this movie. The anticipation that grows throughout this movie is unimaginable. You think they aren't going to meet. OMG...the end of this movie stunned and scared the crap out of me. I have no finger nails left because I chewed them off during the last part of the movie!",The Lake House
351,tomkatil,Another So-so Romance Movie.,6,26 September 2006,"I thought this movie met all my expectations for a romance. I liked very much that it included a tinge of sci-fi in it. I mean, how in the heck is a woman supposed to fall in love with a man from two years ago via a single mailbox? As I watched the movie with my girlfriend I couldn't help but think why Alex (Keanu Reeves) was not jotting down Chicago Cubs scores from Kate (Sandra Bullock) so that he could accrue some ""greenage"" while they were corresponding. Then, it hit me! He's not mailing just any girl, he's writing to a woman who looks like Sandra Bullock for gosh sake! As you watch the movie, the theme becomes clear that Kate and Alex have to figure out: How long would you wait to have a chance to meet the love of your life. That is the premise of this movie and while it was romantic, it was very predictable also.",The Lake House
352,alexestiu,timing as a social and domestic problem nowadays,9,8 September 2006,"At the beginning of the movie I thought the director wasn't ""directing"" the movie regarding details such as how people are dressed when they make an action in the same place. The space was the same: the lake house, but why is one dressed as if it were spring and another as if it were autumn? What happened with the timing? And, as the movie goes on, you feel shocked to realize that the time is not the same, not at all the same. There is a man and a woman, and they start exchanging letters. Nothing strange by this, but a fact: the time. He is in 2004, while she is in 2006. The letters go for her in the past, and for him in the future. And, except the time, the relationship seems indeed perfect! And, isn't it this shocking, for any relationship I mean. The timing of the two partners! Remarks of party persons in the movie, such as ""What's the time's got to do it?"" seem for both of them as real as ever. Because in a relationship timing is quite everything. Most of the marriages that go apart these days are because of the time, because she lives a different time than he does and vice versa. And this movie points this fact wonderfully. In the end, when he has to listen to her to save his life, the scriptwriter suggests a way of passing over this situation, in which the female timing crosses the male one. How? Merely through listening to one another. Because in a relationship, where partners speak just for themselves, time inevitably is different, and partners are not at all together, but alone, so alone! This makes the idea of the movie very actual, as a question mark risen to any ""him"" or ""her"", a question to which everybody should give a rightful and sincere answer: do we (the ""us"" in any relationship)live for real the same time, and if not, what do we do, what do I do to make time happen for both of us just the same, to make us live not just in the same place, but in the same time also?",The Lake House
353,thevoden,Ever had a long distance relationship? What if you had a relationship where you were two years apart from time?,10,23 September 2006,"The Ups: The movie will keep you hooked from beginning to end. Every minute of the movie you will literally beg for the movie not to end. I remember 30 mins before the movie ended I was saying to myself, ""PLEASE GOD Don't MAKE THIS MOVIE END, ITS SO MAGNIFICENT!"". The movie itself is a love/romance story without the drama/fighting. So all you see is love, love and no tragedy. Though its not always a happy ride for the characters in the movie, as they never got to meet each other. And who knows will they ever see each other? Its up to you to find out.The downs: The movie was pretty sad that would slightly make your chest heavy, but not that sad that you would tear up. Its just sad that it would make you feel sorry for the character(s). Don't get me wrong as the reason there is a down is this movie is because the movie wasn't sad enough to make you cry. If I were to compair this movie to the notebook, this movie would be a little more ""felt-sorry"" for as the two main characters know that they will never be able to see each other again.Conclusion: This movie is a magical one-of-a-kind film you will ever see in your life. The director/writer performed a very great job to keep the movie interesting from beginning to the end. This is the movie I've been waiting to see for a long time. No boring parts, mostly every part of the story somehow connects to each other. The plot isn't too trivial to make you go crazy. The ending summarizes it all, there's no teasers. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories/romance/fantasy.",The Lake House
354,gospelpicker,Disappointing,5,24 October 2006,"I usually enjoy Sandra Bullock in these type of roles. I can do without Keanu Reeves. I did enjoy A Walk In The Clouds, but in my opinion, Reeves' demeanor never changes no matter what roll he takes on. He always has that empty, clueless look about him. Sandra, on the other hand, is often very enjoyable no matter what the roll is. I liked the story, but I felt like you never really get familiar with the characters. Also, I think the movie makers did a very poor job of convincing the viewer that Bullock and Reeves have fallen in love. There just isn't any substance to their relationship. Sandra Bullock has a line that says something like ""Him I want to give my whole heart to."". When she says it, you just can't believe her no matter how hard you try. There is a part that I got teared up on though and that is when Reeves' character looks through the book that was written about his father after his father's death. This was the most touching scene in the whole movie.I didn't hate the movie by any means, it's just that I feel like a good story idea was wasted by not digging deeper into what should have been the heart of film. The love between the two main characters. It just wasn't there.",The Lake House

The anticipation made up for any and all slow parts. I highly recommend this movie to one and all. Especially for someone wanting a good cry. I just finished watching the movie. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reaves, once again, make you fall in love all over. This movie kept me in suspense until the end. I loved IT! Don't worry...I think you will like it, too.

I'm a great fan of sci-fi and my job is pretty much based on Logic, but i still CAN see the center point of this movie - Love, that's it. When you love someone you don't care whether it is raining or sunshine, day or night, believable or impossible - you just love the one you want to - and the rest arranges itself.When i watched this movie and came here i saw people saying 'good but impossible' i also see a person saying 'at least its more possible then x-men, spiderman, lord of the rings'. I aggressively deny both - it's not a movie to fight over it, movies don't made to believe on it (they are not law or religion) they are good way to tell about stories, experiences, emotions. So this movie isn't made to believe but to fell in to the emotion - in love.So if you want to feel emotions all by your heart - this is the movie you should watch.",The Lake House

I just won't take another comment finding The Lake House as a ""point for Hollywood"" or asking for the title of the ""book it was based on"". In different countries, it's either Il Mare, Siworae, or ""The Love Letter Box"".While indeed it showed the story as it was in the original, anyone who've seen Il Mare would agree that Bullock's and Reeve's portrayal was nowhere near the mood, the loneliness and longing of the characters in the Korean version. It also would have made the movie a lot more dramatic if the ""guilt element"" in the Korean version was included in the Hollywood version.

Essentially a chic flick I guess but no matter, a love story with a difference and getting beyond the time portal thing, the love between the characters is wonderfully developed and portrayed by Messrs Reeves and Bullock. Add a smattering of a delightful and little heard Paul McCartney song and it's a winner. The various aspects of human emotion are portrayed by all the characters and I could feel some of those highs and lows, hopes and aspirations.

The movie shows differences of love between brothers, mothers, fathers and even people who just show up (Kate's boyfriend the guy you really don't want her with).
Keanu has the ability to show emotions right there with Sandra so the two have a connection even when apart.
The time continuum is confusing so do not go and get scientific. Let it be ""just a movie"". If you try and make every movie real or factual you would not have movies. Let your mind just be in the moment with your heart in the case of this movie.
I watch this movie when I need to just believe love is out there. No it's not reality but it sure doesn't hurt to dream a little.
Love the overall casting as it worked right down to the dog ""Jack"", she's a keeper 😉.

When I actually saw the movie it was even better that what I expected. I think that all hopeless romantics will agree with me on this. Some critics say that the idea for the movie is illogical and they rate this movie as a decent rental then I'd say those people are nothing but cynics who doesn't appreciate a feel good movie. Granted that the idea of a magic mailbox is far fetched its one of the things that added beauty to the story. It's the instrument for the 2 characters to know each other and eventually find true love. Also I disagree to those who say that Keanu and Sandra doesn't have chemistry, because they definitely do! They are almost never at the same scene (obviously since they are living in 2 different time periods) but their emotions are real and you can feel their longing for each other. I think that is the true test of chemistry between two actors. Don't get me wrong...I know the movie is not of Oscar Best Picture material but still it's guaranteed to thug at your heartstrings.

It's best if you don't over-analyze the time-travel details and just go with it... it's a movie, after all. Seriously, I wasn't expecting that much and I got a better feeling from this movie than I have in a long time - it made me feel warm and happy. Plus, the whole theater laughed at some parts, plus people gasped and cried, and at the end everyone applauded. That's a good sign, if you ask me. I don't watch previews so I don't know what they give away about the plot, so I'm not going to give much of anything away here. I will just say that to me this was a uniquely told romantic story. I happen to like Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, although they are by no means favorites of mine, nor do I consider them to be consistently amazing actors (more often they're not... at least he's not...). But they made this story work for me and I believe they have good chemistry. The movie is set in Chicago and shows the city off nicely without trying to beat you over the head with it (a la The Break-Up). One thing I think I related to a lot with these characters is that they are both pretty isolated and lonely, although not in a sad-sack way. I felt a longing from them for someone to relate to, and even though they have opportunities for other people to be involved in their lives... well it's not what's best for them and they don't settle.

It is far from being a great film, a lot of plot holes and a kind of a silly storyline with Keanu, well trying to act (he fails as usual). But it's cute and Sandra just gave a good performance, as usual. She is one of those actresses who never disappoint you, no matter how lame their film is (Jodie Foster is another). Her character is the only thing that you can relate to in the film.

The writer pretty much skipped the part where they fall in love. It was just kind of there suddenly. Some of their banter was horribly corny. I thought the ending left something missing. It was very predictable...I figured out the ending about 10 minutes into the movie, and spent the rest of the time wishing that I hadn't...and also very sappy. ALSO Keanu Reeves wasn't fun to watch at all. I realized that he gives the same ""intense"" look in every single one of his movies (including ""Bill and Ted"").

My problem with it is, if you even watch the previews its pretty easy to guess the ending. Really, I had thought I figured it out by about 20 minutes into it and low and behold I was right. I wont say the movie was boring but so much was telegraphed that when it was over I just had the reaction of ""Yeah OK"". Also I think the Sci-Fi aspect of the movie needed a little more explanation.

373,duhcow,At Least There's A Bus In This One Too.,3,14 June 2006,"The Lake House would have been a much more interesting movie if, instead of focusing on this completely unbelievable, wooden romance between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves (who has about as much acting ability as any random inanimate object around you right now), the director got every single person who ever thought Keanu Reeves was leading man material in the same room and filmed their discussion for two hours. It would have been infinitely more amazing than anything that went on in this dismal Back to the Future meets fecal matter. Like in Speed, a bus happens to be a plot-centric object yet again. Besides the capable performances of Christopher Plummer and Shohreh Aghdashloo, it's the only thing worth seeing. Keanu Reeves delivers possibly his worst performance out of a multitude of spectacularly bad attempts at pretending to be someone other than Keanu Reeves. Sandra Bullock looks embarrassed to be associated with it, and I can't blame her. The main problem with this movie is the time travel paradigm. The best movies that deal deftly with time travel are the ones that either face it head-on (like Back to the Future) or ignore it (Terminator 2). The Lake House does neither, and because the entire concept of the movie is based on time travel and altering the past/future, it falls flat on its face. For instance, there's a scene in the movie where Sandra Bullock decides to meet Keanu Reeves the next day (two years and a day in Keanu's world) and he doesn't show. I won't explain WHY he doesn't show up, but because of something that Sandra Bullock does later in the movie, it cancels out his disappearance, and there's absolutely no reason why he could not have shown up. Issues like that don't necessarily completely ruin the enjoyment factor of the Lake House, but it's difficult to believe anything this movie holds up as true when it ignores common sense. If your idea of a good time is watching Keanu Reeves pretend to know how to read and write, you will be rewarded.",The Lake House
374,ntokos,Great romance/fantasy... a different ending though would have raised it for 10/10,5,31 August 2006,"I really liked that movie: inspiring script, great plot unfolding, great chemistry between the actors. A romance/fantasy/drama story worth seeing.But... the ending condemns the movie to the level of ""very good"" as it targets on leaving the audience (the undemanding part of it) with a big smile (a happy end to say). From an artistic point of view (after all cinema supposed to be art), a sad ending, i.e. Alex never receives the letter, dies and they never meet again, would have raised the movie to an excellent romantic drama... would have scored a 10/10.Aside from that, the happy end of the movie suffers from a great logical flaw: a couple of hours before Kate puts the ""warning"" letter into Alex's mailbox, she has been informed from Alex's brother (Henry) that Alex has died 2 years ago...so, the ""happy end"" means that Alex comes back from the dead!!! Think for instance, that Henry (who knows that Alex is dead for 2 years) is to be informed that Alex lives... he's somehow resurrected!!!None the less, I say again, it is a very good movie, surely worth seeing it (after all, I voted for 8/10).",The Lake House
375,Maymer,"Touching story, beautifully shot and well acted. A must see.",9,24 June 2006,"I must admit, I wasn't expecting a good film when I went into the cinema. The TV spot is hardly encouraging, however I stand corrected.Credit must be given to Sandra Bullock and Keannu Reeves. It must be incredibly difficult to act in a romance film, with only a handful of short scenes together. When the pair do meet, it is very fluid and they do not fall into the usual trap of a stiff relationship.(SPOILER)One element of the film that I both love and dislike is at the beginning of the film when a ""mystery man"" is killed in a car crash right in front of Kate Forster (in her 2006). The rather annoying thing (in my opinion) about this is that it is painfully obvious from about the middle of the movie onwards who the victim was. However, the beauty of the scene in Alex's 2006 is that it would have given a satisfactory (perhaps and even better and more memorable) ending if Alejandro Agresti had decided to continue it down that route, instead of the course it took.One other point that works against The Lake House is the fact that if Alex is two years behind Kate, and they are living at the same speeds, then technically Alex would never actually be able to meet Kate. However, this factor only really surfaces as you leave the cinema and is such a minor thing compared to the rest of the film, that it hardly matters.",The Lake House

You won't need a degree to work anything out (except perhaps, as previously mentioned, to work out who was where, when, how and why.)

378,faith_bgd,space and time people...,1,5 September 2006,"Even if you accept certain things like melodramatic directing, non-dynamic (slow, boring)editing, there are still some things that have to bother any viewer who saw more then two films in his life. Dialogs like the one between Sandra Bullock and her mother where Sandra asks her ""WHY DID YOU MARRY DAD"" and mother replies ""SO YOU COULD ASK ME THAT QUESTION""! And that's it, THE END OF SCENE. Why is it there in the first place?THE BIGGEST FLUKE!!!After they established their communication via the magic mailbox, one of the first things that Sandra(in 2006) writes to Keanu(in 2004) is that ""she had a tough day, a man died on her hands at the Daily Plaza."" As the first doctor who tried to help the man she would have surely remember his face, and his name too, because she would write a report, and death certificate containing his personal info. Now as the film goes on we find out that they(Sandra and Keanu, both in 2004) have met and even kissed at a party. Sandra Bullock's boyfriend interrupts their kiss, now, every person can remember who did he/she kissed (assuming they weren't under influence of alcohol :)), especially if the kiss was seen by your boyfriend, and caused a brake-up. Next, Sandra?(2006) figures out that IT WAS HIM!!! She immediately sends him a letter saying IT WAS YOU, and a lot of blah blah...Where is the problem? Now we set the time-line.1. They meet and kiss at the party2. He gets killed in the accident3. She figures it was him at the party, but not in the accident too.She knows his name, She knows how he looks like and she remembers him from the party that occurred before the accident but she does't find out that it was him who died until the very end. HOW???And at the end, He just shows up in front of the house, but what happens with his brother,and the rest of people in the world who think he is DEAD. What happens? Does he come to his brother and says Hi I'm alive now... An attempt to explain that, with CHANGE OF COUNCSNECES, does't do the trick, cause if that was the case Sandra Bullock is not immune to it, she would have to suffer the same consistencies. If he was alive she wouldn't be at the lake house at all, because there would be no need...A cut-back to the restaurant with him showing up would be a better solution...",The Lake House

And also as a side note the storyline of 'The Lakehouse' is relatively complex and kids younger then 15 or so probably won't understand all the aspects of it. Now on to the movie..I have to say that the main reason I wanted to check out this movie was simply because of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock as people. And I must say their chemistry in 'The Lakehouse' DID NOT disappoint. I found that where the storyline was perhaps lacking..Keanu and Sandra make up for it in the way they portray their two characters.

But the problem is that even though Cate and Alex live in the same country and city and (almost) at the same time, they just cannot seem to find each other. It is a brilliant story about how it does not matter if the time is not really right - when true love strikes, time is a relative factor. Cate and Alex face a series of obstacles to get to each other, and a chain of coincidences presents during this path. Will they ever be at the right place in the right time?

Thought it would be too crazy. Too ""out there"". But I'm glad I decided to take it anyway because, somehow, it just all works. The story is simple and pure and the actors really connect to each other and to the audience. Well, at least I felt a connection.

While there is no physical action to ""drool"" over, guys this one is for us who are still hoping for that ""right"" woman in our lives.

So, there is one option: Alex died in Kate's arms, but she didn't see his face at this moment.... but she tried to help him just after the accident...

386,ixluvxjamesxfranco,:-/ disappointment,2,24 June 2006,"To tell the truth, Keanu Reeves isn't exactly my favorite actor. However, his chemistry with Sandra Bullock in Speed did impress me, and so I thought this movie was going to be very good. Unfortunately, however, I was wrong. The movie was too slow-moving, first off. I felt like i'd been sitting there for hours upon hours. Also, the dialogue was too forced. I mean, there were some pretty good lines, but it was all just sort of rushed through, without any thought put into what was being said. As a result, half the scenes went over my head. I think if a few major changes were made, this movie could've been much better. There should've been a different director. There also should've been more character development in the beginning of the story. This doesn't mean just simply stating what the main characters' occupations were. It should've gone beyond that. There should've been scenes of real hardship, not just shots of someone frowning and looking off into the distance for no apparent reason. I also think Mark Ruffalo should've played Keanu's part. He's much more down-to-earth and can actually CHANGE the tone of his voice to give his words meaning (unlike ol' Keanu). Ruffalo can be a romantic, slightly humorous character who has gone through a lot of heartbreak and family problems. He doesn't have the tacky glamour that other stars have. He's more realistic. Also, there should've been a different actor to play the brother. He didn't look related to Keanu at all. Probably the only thing about the movie that impressed me was the soundtrack. I think I might actually consider buying it. Overall, however, this movie was a disappointment and it easily could've been much better if some TIME and thought had been contributed more.",The Lake House
387,angelgirl_giselle,The Lake House,7,6 November 2006,"Having watched ""Il Mare"" the original Korean version of ""The Lake House,"" I hope not to be bias in this review. The Lake House was actually a better American adaptation of the original film than I initially thought. The presentation of the lake house was beautifully done. I both enjoyed the performance of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, two actors I truly admire! And the script was well written! The two leads Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock had good chemistry as did the leads in Il Mare. Their relationship moved rather quickly where both are in love about half way through the movie. In Il Mare the relationship moved progressively to the point that some may perceive the relationship as friendship or love that is blooming. And this depends on the audience preference.I must admit that the storyline of The Lake House was much easier to follow; however the plot was pretty cliché and predictable. The ending for the movie was rather the ideal happy ending for the couple. And again, it depends on the audience if they like that kind of closure at the end. The story of Il Mare was difficult to follow, and it's up to the audience to put the pieces together. And the ending left some room for the audience to draw their own conclusions. Personally, I felt that the ending of Il Mare was more realistic. I had a chance to explore and ask myself questions at the end of movie. I believe that both movies were good! However, it appeared that the ""magical"" aspect of Il Mare was missing in The Lake House. The Lake House was a decent adaptation of the film. The music was great and you could definitely feel the chemistry between the two leads. Overall, it was an okay movie! But if I had watched the The Lake House before Il Mare, I would've probably still prefer Il Mare! ^__^ I guess I'll never know!",The Lake House

Sandra Bullock's character leaves a letter to the new owner of her house and he reads it two years earlier. Sandra and Keanu Reeves are very believable, and make this story work.

My question was that when he gets to 2006 on Febuary 14th wouldn't it be 2008 on Febuary 14th in her time. how does time stop? does it make sense that if she wants to she can make time stop? If so why didn't she do it earlier in the movie. Why didn't Alex tell Kate that he died on February 14th. Was he not aware of his own death because he was earlier in time than that. The movie is pretty confusing but if you don't really think about it, it is a very good and cute movie. That is why I gave it a nine even though it has some glitches in it.",The Lake House
390,susan-391,"Well the acting was good, but very little else, I was so disappointed!",3,23 August 2007,"I usually like Sandra Bullocks films, with a few exceptions she usually chooses to work in movies that are at least entertaining and often stimulate the old grey matter a little! Ms Bullock was credible playing the part of Kate, a hard working Doctor who is not happy about the possibility that she may be alone the rest of her life, but at the same time she is equally afraid to commit to a relationship that might fall far short of her expectations. In fact her situation is not unlike that of Anne Elliot, the Heroine Of Persuasion: a book that Kate claims is her favourite novel. However,for someone who claims the book to be her particular favourite she makes a poor job of summarising the plot! And that plot summary error, touches on the real flaws with The Lake House. The acting is good,the characters are interesting: particularly Kate's mother and the Lake House and scenery surrounding it are beautiful. And I have no issues in relation to the film being a fantasy. Fantasy can sometimes add an element of something special to a romance, think of the beautiful and fantastical 'A Matter of Life and Death' and David Niven falling in love with a girl at the other end of a radio transmission moments before he dies and then throwing himself from heaven to find her. Strong stuff! The real problem with the Lake House are the weaknesses in the plot! Eg. Kate buys Alex his fathers book,his father is a famous architect and Kate sends Alex his fathers book before it has even been published, Kate has also seen a copy of Alex's fathers death certificate; yet later when she meets Alex's brother she seem to have no idea that Alex was related to him! This despite the fact that Alex has told her he has a brother. Also the brother just happens to be an Architect as well. I mean how common is the name Wyland in Chicago? Is every third person named Wyland and an architect? Also apart from the time gap, the two lovers face difficulties due to Kate's fears of getting too close to Alex and getting hurt. She has an excuse to push him away when Alex arranges to meet her for a date and does not turn up, since he is 2 years in the past he cannot explain why and naturally says something must have come up, but doesn't appear too concerned.Kate then decides to tell him not to contact her anymore and then tells him about a man who died suddenly on Valentines day and says you don't know what will happen, thus suggesting either that 2 years is too long to wait and Alex has changed his mind about her, or that poor Alex has snuffed it! But Kate, the woman who apparently loves him doesn't want to know what has happened to him and doesn't try to find out not even to help him. She simply says ""Its already happened"" Which is bit cold for a woman in love, even one afraid of commitment! I am sorry to say it,despite the plus of this movie having Keanu Reeves as the romantic lead which should happen more often, the Lake House suffers from a plot that has a tad too many rough edges and gaping holes.",The Lake House

She is so NOT Hollywood. I'd say she is a star as stars used to be, pre 90's.Keanu Reeves, like someone mentioned in another review, is not a flashy actor. He doesn't pull the ego and ATTEMPT to charm like say, Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. He's understated. He gives the lines their equally deserved limelight. He's got the right combination of star quality and the actor's actor factor going that I respect him more than Cruise or Pitt.The screenplay? Do you we always want everything spelled out for us?

The writers manage to take an improbable phenomenon of people being 2 years apart and work the differences of their time-frame beautifully into the story. For anyone who has watched Keanu Reeves through the years, he's maturing wonderfully both physically and as a person and he brings the same charm to ""The Lake House"" that he did in ""Something's Got To Give."" He and Sandra Bullock have a chemistry between them that took a story about a bomb on a bus and turned it into a romantic love story with action.

Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves' chemistry was good.i recommend that you see this movie with people that want to fall in love or have fallen in love because i know that it might now seem believable but you need to JUST watch the movie not question every little thing that the characters do.",The Lake House
405,davida8,The Editing let this show down,1,4 August 2006,"The Stars all acted well but the editing was dreadful Cutting from one close up to another close up and then yet another. the rhythm of the editing seemed right out of sync. The timing allowed for each small section of story was also worrying and wasn't proportioned according to importance to the story. Great idea, script didn't grate, could have been better, Half the time the script wasn't supported by visuals. The standard was a great disappointment, with both my friend and myself thinking that a great movie probably lay on the cutting room floor so to speak. It really made us value the many good editors that have made the difference on other movies.",The Lake House
406,redbordeaux78,Run like hell,1,14 July 2006,"I watch a lot of movies, about 5 a week. I have seen great movies and terrible ones. But nothing like The Lake House. This has got to be the worse movie ever filmed. It's confusing, unattached, boring, it has bad dialog. Everything that could possibly be wrong is wrong with this piece of trash. I can't believe top notch people like Christopher Plummer, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves would ever get involved in this mess. I'd give it a minus 5 stars if I could. The All Time Worse movie Award goes to The Lake House. Crap House would be more like it. Skip it. Save your time and money. Run (don't walk) away from this trash. Run for the hills.",The Lake House
407,praider00,See the Korean Original,3,13 June 2006,"I'd like to start by saying I found out the Lakehouse is a Hollywood remake of Il Mare (Siwore) a Korean film done in 2000. The director stole frame for frame shots why should he even get credit for such a movie, everything was laid out for him. It always baffles me why not just release the Korean version here in the states... ugh! I think you should just rent Il Mare and forgo seeing The Lakehouse because all the redeeming qualities for this movie were taken straight from the Korean original.Note the following is how I felt before discovering how similar the original was: First off for all who have been enticed by the previews, yes this movie is going to be a cheesy one so bring crackers. Mmmm cheese and crackers... hehehe. OK, OK I can't be too hard on the movie. It was a fun little fantasy fairytale of a love story and those are good every now and again. I think some people are going to be very critical of the actors specifically the pairing of Keanu with Bullock. It's clearly Hollywood manufacturing just as You've Got Mail was for Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan... and at times the Keanu / Bullock paring seems kind of forced. Oh a side note, prepare yourself for some pretty corny liners.I do have to admit not all the scenes were terrible, nor was the movie horrible overall. In fact the editing was well done and refreshing. Much of the cinematography and set design was beautiful. I'd have to say it's more of an OK sort of movie. There is enough plot development, event though predictable at times, to strike up conversation afterwords. Without giving away too much, the script does well by playing around with the ""two years apart"" such as having things instantly happen or completing the thought... OH! that's how that got there. (You'll understand more if you see the movie) There's even some deeper artsy/philosophical undertones to pick up on with the whole time progresses, people change while some things remain everlasting... participating the scene when Keanu's character is talking with his dad.To sum up the Lakehouse is a cocktail of 2 parts Sleepless in Seattle (or rather An Affair to Remember), 1 part Sliding Doors, and a hint of The Notebook. Expect to come just shy of getting a buzz... you'll still be safe to drive. :)",The Lake House
408,crystalized_s,Wonderful Romantic Chemistry,10,25 June 2006,"I truly enjoyed this movie. I have to think just a bit of Sleepless in Seattle where the majority of the movie has the two leads never laying eyes on each other - this is not exactly like that but it brings it to mind because in both of the movies I thought that they did a really good job of conveying a real romantic chemistry even though the characters see little of each other.On the topic of chemistry I guess my following comment could be a little bit of a spoiler so skip over this if you are concerned.The first kiss between the two of them reminded me of everything that is fantastic about a first kiss. The longing, the uncertainty and the final moment when you decide to just go ahead and go for it. For this scene if for nothing else I will definitely be buying this movie.There is more I could say but this is where I will stop! Enjoy it for yourself.",The Lake House
409,gdgroves-1,Best I have seen in a long time!,9,25 June 2006,"I was totally captivated by this film. All of my problems disappeared while it was playing. Despite the seriousness of the film, there was an appropriate amount of humor in it.Those who are dreamers and who like fantasy will love this film. Some things may not make sense, but it doesn't detract from it. Also, this is a movie you wouldn't be embarrassed taking your girlfriend to. Seemed to promote old-time values. It probably will not do well at the box office because there was no sex in it. Even the kisses were not the usual eat them alive type.Well made, casted, and acted, especially by the lead characters.",The Lake House
410,cavener-1,Timing is everything!,10,16 June 2006,"This was great popcorn fare with your significant other! Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are once again a great on screen couple, although they weren't often on screen together. Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing and enough closeups to satisfy all. Christopher Plummer was an interesting supporting actor and as always commanded the screen. As a matter of fact there were a lot of interesting supporting actors, one from the TV series ""24"", there was Jack the dog, and of course the Lakehouse. I'm sorry I forgot to mention the architecture of Chicago and the mailbox.The whole time issue kept us talking long after the movie was over. Don't get too caught up in the plausibility aspect just enjoy it as a romantic fantasy, we all need some escape now and then. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves fans won't be disappointed and I am sure they may pick up a few new ones along the way. A great release to end the Hollywood drought of late. Go see it!",The Lake House
411,lulualcott,In the best tradition of time-travel romance,10,16 June 2006,"Reeves and Bullock have a natural chemistry and clearly The Lake House puts them at their best. The movie takes the time to unfold, instead of rushing things to quicken the pace. In this ""get it yesterday"" world, I enjoyed the unfolding of the plot, the interaction of characters, the common elements (Jack, the doctor, etc.) that forward the plot rather than obscure it, and, unlike some recent films, the music choices enhance rather than hinder the mood and the plot. Unlike Somewhere in Time, where you knew from the beginning the outcome would not be good, and the ending is extremely disappointing, here the story works its way to a conclusion that was, to put it mildly, unexpected. I definitely plan to see this one again, and when it comes out on DVD, I plan to add it to my collection. An excellent performance all around",The Lake House
412,kelli_the_great,"Predictable, but good.",10,16 June 2006,"I loved it! though it was somewhat predictable, it wasn't predictable in a way that made you feel like you'd already seen the movie. in fact, it almost made it better because it made the movie easier to follow, as it was slightly confusing at parts. keanu reeves and Sandra bullock do romantic really well together. there was good chemistry. one thing i didn't like so much was that keanu's voice sounded boring, robotic even, when he was narrating his letters. other than that the acting was great and so was the plot! this movie is definitely more suited for a female audience as most of you probably predicted. i saw it with one of my guy friends and he found it extremely boring, so if you want to take your boyfriend to a movie, this may not be the best choice. my suggestion is to see it with a group of friends.",The Lake House
413,dleeun1,one of my favorite love story movies of all time,10,17 June 2006,"I predict this movie will become a classic within a certain genre. I loved the movie when I saw it, and even more, after, when the nuances penetrated. Such a pleasure to find a movie that waltzes thru time and space instead of the usual slam bam flicks that hurt my eyes. My husband loved it too, and he usually walks out of the room when a love story is on the tube. Just sit and relax and let the movie take you there, forget logic that is fostered within this earth's frequency (even though I must admit I am a Sudoku junkie). This movie VIBRATED. The last 2 words may become as famous as ""You had me at Hello."" 'Nuf said - GO SEE IT.",The Lake House
414,JoeJack101,Great!,10,17 June 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie all week. When the film got into the first 15 minutes, I questioned whether or not it was going to end up being boring, but it was nothing short of fantastic. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but you will walk away very happy that you saw this film. Don't expect a whole bunch of comedy in this movie. It didn't need much, because it wouldn't have fit the mood and tone of the film. The film never leaves you thinking to yourself, ""This couldn't happen in real life."" It's about letting go of this mental concept that everything has to make sense, and Sandra's character has to learn to be able to do that. Great job Sandra and Keanu!",The Lake House
415,nancysummers,Needs more explanation about the time warp.,4,17 June 2006,"I liked the characters and the actors portraying them. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are two favorites of mine and that's really what drew me to the movie in the first place. While we go to be ""entertained"" when we see a movie and dive into the ""fantasy"" of the movies, this particular movie had a great romantic storyline, which was good. But there are some holes in the movie that need to be filled.I understood that there was a time warp. The movie just didn't explain how or why. To me that was frustrating. I tried to just accept it as fantasy and just enjoy the romantic story, but at the end of the movie I found myself trying to figure out how/why there was a time warp and if the ending was her imagination or whether it really happened. I will say, most of the people in the audience made comments about it being confusing and some even laughed because they thought it was dumb.I love the actors, I love the romantic story line, the photography was good also. The use of Chicago's architecture was wonderful.",The Lake House

This is a movie you can watch over and over again and point out something new every time!! The ending was perfect and the director made it easy to understand which surprised me because normally I get very confused in movies like this but this one was easy to follow, I loved it!!!!! And as for Keanu Reeves, gorgeous as always, Sandra looks amazing as well!! I love how they have played in more then one movie together they are a good team and I'm sure they attract a lot of viewers!! The storyline was amazing I couldn't stop wondering what was going to happen next and when they would meet..if you haven't seen this movie yet, put it on your to-do list..you won't be disappointed! -Katie",The Lake House
417,vichume,I loved it,10,17 June 2006,"I really did not know what to expect when I went to the movies today. Ithought the premise just did not seem believable. However, the movie was so well done that you did not care. You did not care to understand how the letters in the mailbox got to Alex or Kate. It was a great romantic movie. I am a true romantic at heart and love great romances. I wondered if this story was ever a book. I love to read and think that it would make a great read. I feel in love with the characters and their stories. I can truly say that you are sitting on the edge of your seat, anticipating that moment that they will actually meet. The scene where they danced in the yard was beautiful. The music selections were a good choice. Bring along a box of Kleenexes - you may find yourself needing it to wipe the tears away. I highly recommend the movie!",The Lake House
418,yasminakbar,Remake of A Korean Film,5,19 June 2006,"I hate to say it but this remake of ""Il Mare"", a South Korean film from 2000, despite the uniqueness of the story is ruined by the casting of Sandra Bullock and, to a lesser extent, Keanu Reeves as well as the addition of the usual Hollywood 'epic' ingredients and a cop-out ending that simply panders to the perceived mainstream. I will not spoil it for those who haven't seen either the Korean original or the remake and I strongly suggest that if you are in the mood for a romantic story which is somewhat different from the rest, go for the Korean original. The approach is fresh and it requires the audience to think a little. This is not to say that 'The Lake House' is a bad film, it is not, but the subject matter is handled much better by the original. Given that this film requires the audience to leave aside logic and accept it as a supernatural love story, the credibility gaps in the remake are just far too obvious to allow the viewer to really enjoy it. The ending does ruin it all.",The Lake House
419,project626,Magical!!,9,18 June 2006,"Romance is magical and that is all you have to know in order to enjoy this movie. Love isn't meant to be over-analyzed and if you stay with that, you will spend two hours transported into a beautiful love story. On the way home, I tried to review the story in my mind as far as the time/distance thing, and decided that I didn't need to completely understand it in order to keep that warm fuzzy feeling that I got from this movie. In an age filled with bed hopping and violence (which I enjoy in movies) it was nice to see an old fashioned romance with a tender heart. If you are a die hard romantic and believe that love can conquer all, you will really enjoy this flick. So take the one that you love to this beautiful story. And if you haven't found that special someone yet-go see it and believe in the power of love!!!",The Lake House

While viewing The Lake House I was so caught up in the story and in the ""what's next"" factor that I was literally feeling what the characters felt - from the frustration, to the pain, to the love. Suspense in a romance is not an easy thing to attain but this movie proved that it could be attained in a very big way. Reeves and Bullock gave excellent performances and were so believable and moving, even though their predicament is one of ""other worldly"" charms. The audience roots for Kate and Alex - not matter that the story is somewhat magical it, as well as the characters, are believable and lovable. I was more than moved by this movie. It was wonderfully written and filmed. Not only was it one of the most touching stories I've seen, it was a beautiful film. My suggestion is that everyone should RUN to the nearest theater to see this film. It will touch you on many levels.",The Lake House
421,outercha,missing dog,10,18 June 2006,"I have more of a question than a commit about the movie,that I thought was very good, and made you think of many things that could happen.I was wondering what happened to the dog at the end of the picture? And where did he go when he ran down the path in the woods? My wife and myself suspect that the dog either ran into the future or died. Only because we did not see him at the end of the show.Also we were wondering how the dog moved from 2004 to 2006?

I saw it for the first time and know I have to go back and see it again and again to pick out all the details. There seems to be some overlap in details and time, so I want to see it again to put the pieces together. It is very cleaver and reminds me of ""Somewhere in Time.""I heard that Cusack was originally selected for the male lead. Keaneu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have a chemistry that is believable and compelling. I know that most of this was shot in Chicago. Does anyone know if the Lake House is real and where it is located?",The Lake House
423,bobby_x-1,I really liked this movie.,10,18 June 2006,"I'm a huge fan of movies that involve the time travel element. This movie had kept my attention and I was entertained from start to finish. It did kinda remind me of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure due Keanu and the time travel stuff , (Im kidding). If you are a fan of such time travel flicks, then see this one. It does have ""chick flick"" written all over it, but most guys can deal with that. I found it to be thought provoking as well. I always think I'm not going to like a Keanu movie, but I keep finding myself entertained. Here are some other movies you might like if you are a fan of the time travel element. The Phildelphia Experiment, Somewhere In Time and Kate and Leopold. All very entertaining... but don't try to dissect them... there is no such thing as a flawless time travel flick.Recommended!",The Lake House

You will understand the meaning of the word fate. I don't care what the critics say, after all it is just their opinion and their job to criticize.Keanu Reeves is the hottest romantic lead to come along in quite a while. It would do all the women of the world a lot of good to see him in more of these type roles.I would recommend not trying to figuring out or even understanding why the mailbox is magic, just go with the flow that it is magic.A great movie for a first or second date with a special person.",The Lake House
425,jme2,What a great movie!!!,10,19 June 2006,"I went to see this movie over the weekend and it was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time, as even my husband agreed. I don't get why everyone is saying that you can't understand or follow the movie. Aren't most movies considered non-realistic anyway. Why can't people just accept the time difference, sit back and enjoy it? I must say that it was good to see Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves together again and I also applaud the fact that this was a clean movie. Unfortunately there are not many of those left these days. Thanks for the experience and I hope that more people get to enjoy this movie like we did.",The Lake House

Did she die too and they met in the afterlife? Did she go back in time to the Lake House just prior to him getting hit by the bus on Valentine's Day? I thought the two characters complimented one another beautifully and I could almost believe a relationship like that. Another thing I did not understand was her finding the book (very well worn) under the floorboard of her apartment...how did that get there when her apartment had not even been built? Normally I'm not clueless about a movie but the ending really puzzled me and if someone would please respond, I would really appreciate the explanation that has eluded me.",The Lake House

428,sammizhot,Excellent!,8,27 July 2006,"I watched this movie entirely because of the actors, and I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised by the fluidity of the movie. It's been quite a while since I've watched a film which really (successfully) tugs at your heartstrings and speaks to you not only visually but emotionally. You feel for the characters with every sentence they speak to each other, every emotion they express and every expression they make. It's not an original script, and I was worried that it would turn out corny or contrived like many adapted movies. Fortunately for us, they've done their job well. Sandra Bullock, especially, I felt played her part extremely well, and I was supremely impressed. A definite must-watch!",The Lake House
429,Lis1316,huh?,5,23 June 2006,"This movie was great to start out. The lake house has true meaning and worth to both of the characters which is why they connect so well. The letters seem to have chemistry as well as some flirty substance. One aspect i did not understand was in the park, how they talked to each other yet they were two years apart.They really did seem to fall in love but yet can not meet or have any real interaction. Also, if two people are truly in love, shouldn't they try everything to be together even if one try to meet didn't work out the way it was supposed to? If they truly are 2 years apart, how can they ever meet like they do in the end? How come he never changed history when he went to her birthday party? The Lake House just didn't seem to make any sense at some points of the plot. This is a hard movie for any person that has a seriously logical mind.",The Lake House
430,adramababe07,Lake House and it's importance.,9,21 June 2006,"Being a fan of Keanu Reeves, I went to see this movie hoping for that aesthetically pleased (more euphoric) feeling I get whenever he smiles. I got exactly what I wanted, and, even more, I walked out of Lake House saying ""that movie just makes everything better."" Honestly, even with the Matrix under his belt, I think Keanu really got it right with this one. He was well characterized. Plus, he cries (girlish sigh).The comment previous about ""implausible"" is completely correct. I also enjoyed ""Frequency"" as well as ""Wicker Park"", both movies made of flashbacks and changes in time whose plots could be considered just as impossible as the happenings in this movie. In all of these movies, you have to have your brain on. Pay attention. Analyze. But, simultaneously, the movie is easily followed and greatly enjoyable.So, why the 9? Well, every movie has room for improvement. There were powerful lines not delivered to their best I believe. Especially; ""she is more real to me than I have ever known,"" and ""the man I can never meet--I want to give my whole heart to."" These lines embody the very spirit of the movie, and are treated as any other line. Other lines, like the monologue about light delivered to Alex by his father, go misunderstood--and sadly forgotten--if not explained or applied later.However, the conversations between Kate and Alex especially, as well as some with other characters, are endearing. This movie really captured the realities--as well as the implausibilities--of human relations. Kate and Alex's support system is beautiful to watch. The small connections they make with each other, like the tree and Alex's dad's Memoir, really bring a whole new set of emotions out for the audience. For this, the movie deserves recognition.I love Lake House, and all it's impossibilities.",The Lake House
431,allen4107,Another Round for Romance,10,22 June 2006,"No doubt about it. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves' chemistry in this movie is still electrifying since their first team-up in ""Speed."" They are two of the actors that I've waited to be together again in one movie and this one's worth the waiting. I truly fell in love with the film. Its entire message for the viewers was that love holds no boundaries and definitely holds no barriers even when it comes to time. Forget about the impossibilities of the plot. The important is, two great actors are able to make it real as anyone of us dreaming that things like this do really come true. This surely will one of the romantic films I will cherish over and over again. Two thumbs up!",The Lake House
432,Sandy-Rah,Standard romantic film with drama and hints of fantasy,8,22 June 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It ran for approximately 1 hr 45min and not once did I consider the passing of time - unless it related to the storyline! It was nice to see Sandra Bullock with a different hairstyle for a change and I thought she looked good with shorter hair. She plays 'Kate' a doctor in a Chicago hospital and maybe it was just me, but I just couldn't see her as a doctor. However it did not in any way affect my enjoyment of the film as most it of was to do with the interaction of, and between the various main characters.Keanu Reeves portrayal of Alex Wyler was excellent. I found the character totally believable and moving. I cared what he went through and what happened to him.One 'character' who seemed to be important within the story was 'Jack'. A few unanswered questions about her but I think when you enjoy a film, you don't need to start questioning or nitpicking on comparatively small details.Yes, I found a few moments which seemed a little strange or odd, mainly because of the storyline being set two years apart yet running parallel to each other. But I had my fingers crossed for the possibly unlikely 'happy ending' so those few moments were not going to detract me from enjoying the film.If you enjoy action films with blood, guts, lots of swearing and not much story then you probably would not enjoy this film. However, if you enjoy a film with an interesting story, carefully woven to link several different lives and set in two fairly close time periods then you will enjoy this film.If you are a fan of Sandra Bullock or Keanu Reeves then you may see that as an added bonus. I was not a big fan of Keanu Reeves, but after seeing this film - well I am now! I have been a fan of Sandra Bullock for a long time and together again in The Lake House, it is easy to see how well they must get on.I highly recommend this film.",The Lake House
433,twcsanvail,what year?,7,22 June 2006,"Firstly, I liked the movie. It reminds me of ""Castaway"". You have to be content to actually watch and go along with the movie and not be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Don't read if you haven't seen the movie:As mentioned in a prior comment, you do kind of wonder why she didn't recognize Alex- however folks, he was hit by a bus. That does tend to alter your appearance. But my big question is what year is it when the movie ends? My husband says Feb. 2006 and I say Feb. 2008. She saves his life by writing the letter, and he has to wait two years to ""catch up"" with her, which he can do since now he's actually alive in this new version. Right?",The Lake House
434,kain-21,"Really, Keanu? I thought you were better than this.",3,23 June 2006,"She was beautiful, strong and moving. Her performance was believable; you could feel every one of her emotions radiating from the screen. Her name? ""Jack"", the dog.However, a solid performance by one canine can not save the rest of the ensemble which comprises this collection of loosely strung together premises and themes. Keanu Reeves does his best to inject raw emotion into every one of his lines, but the result is less of a verbal masterpiece and more of a sap-induced mess. Sandra Bullock, while attempting to play a tortured doctor soul who feels isolated from the real world, is surrounded by loving friends, a beautiful mother, and a man who, albeit uptight... lives in the same year. Her life is not as tragic as it seems to be portrayed.Basically, I would take the $8.00 you were planning on spending on this movie and burn it. Or punch yourself in the face before you walk into the theater so you're void of feelings before it begins. It's really up to you.",The Lake House

I do enjoy both actors and especially working together in this film. I was left a little sad and confused until I read some of the comments on this site. I am still sad, because I want it to be real the way love should be. I would like to thank the film industry for producing this film. We need films like this, like the way they were long ago. Soft and kind. ""At least we have Paris""! Which movie did that come from readers? I will see the movie again. The Lake House. Everyone should be blessed with such love. Thanks.I saw the movie again. It's not that I do not have a life because I do, but everyone should be able to go to a place where you can privately fantasize that someone could love you in such a way that it strikes you inside for while. I purchased the sound track. Paul McCartney's song ""This Never Happened Before"", fits the theme perfectly. Will there be a DVD soon?Thank you.

I actually made ""hurry up"" motions at the screen, sitting in the theatre, drumming my fingers on my thighs in frustration at the lagging scenes.There were so many things in this movie that made no sense, you couldn't keep up with them. And I'm sorry but I like my characters DEVELOPED, and there were quite a few influential people that affected the storyline, who's stories were just left drifting in the ""timewarped"" breeze.Sandra and Keanu deserved better material, as they both are very talented.If anything, it's a renter.",The Lake House

This is only a movie but kind of makes me believe love can do anything. Must be the romantic person inside of me. The movies they have played side by side have always been great movies. They really make a great couple, to bad it is only in the movies. I do hope in the future they do many more movies together, they click. I will be the first in line over here.",The Lake House
438,nancytx,Not just a chick flick,8,24 June 2006,"This is not just a ""bring your girlfriends movie"". I loved it, but so did my husband. It was a very touching movie but had enough of the science fiction in it to keep my husband interested. The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock was fantastic, even better than in ""Speed"". I think Keanu really had a chance to show he could act. I would have to say I enjoyed Keanu in this movie more than any other. ""The Matrix"" was a really good movie and I liked him in it but this really seemed to bring out a different side to his acting. Don't over analyze this one just enjoy the story. Make sure you bring lots of tissues. It is definitely a tear jerker. Girls don't be afraid to bring the guys to this one!",The Lake House
439,fredwagner,See it as it is and enjoy the show!~~~~~,8,24 June 2006,"SPOILER ALERT. READER BE WARNED. The Lake House is one of the better chick flicks that I have seen in the past couple of years. Although there were some major flaws/give aways early on in the movie (it was painfully obvious that Alex, Keanu's character, was the one got hit by the bus), you feel good leaving the theater knowing that everyone got what they wanted. Let's face it, this is not the Silence of the Lamb or The Usual Suspects. There is no need to be too harsh on the logic behind the story and just see it as it is: A CHICK FLICK. As usual, Keanu did not show case much talent in acting but Sandra was amusing but they definitely had on-screen chemistry. If you plan to bring a date to the movie, The Lake House is definitely the best pick of the summer.",The Lake House
440,Sheeyah0,An Average Romantic Movie,5,24 June 2006,"The Lake House is your stereotypical ""chick flick."" If you are someone like myself who wants things to make sense, you will not like this movie. If you can ignore the nonsense of the ""hole in the space/time continuum,"" you will probably enjoy the romance.The romantic side is good, the plot is nonsensical, placing this movie right in the middle of romances. It's not good, it's not terrible, it just is. It's not a good date movie because couples will most likely be split on their opinions. If you want things to make sense, you'll be taken out of the movie as soon as she gets the first letter. If you're a hopeless romantic, you won't care.If you haven't seen this movie yet, wait until the DVD comes out. There's a great opportunity for an alternate ending that makes the movie more appealing if you wait to rent it.",The Lake House

Just curious.My wife and I enjoyed the movie although she had a little difficulty understanding the implications of the ending. I won't discuss that further here. If you can suspend belief on the main plot twist, the rest is very good.The actors did a good job expressing their emotions, although I would have preferred more development on Chritopher Plumber's role.

442,deeannechino,Awesome!,10,25 June 2006,"This, to me, is the greatest chick-flick ever!!!! A real make-you-feel-good-even-through-your-tears movie!!! I highly recommend this movie to everyone! I must admit that I was skeptical of seeing Keanu and Sandra in the same movie, again. I was afraid it would be some kind of spin on their ""Speed"" love relationship. Boy, was I wrong! Guys take your girls! Do you believe in soulmates? This will make you think about that question very seriously. There is so much in this movie that we can all relate to. It is absolutely amazing how people come in and out of our lives and the effect that they have on us - even in the slightest way.

443,grdaemon,Couple of disaster,4,26 June 2006,"Most unsuccessful to impersonate anyone; both of the actors are a key to an unsuccessful movie.They should not be held together in a movie again since .I wonder why Hollywood having billions of budget keeps working around with the same actors all the time.I liked Keanu in Matrix I even fancied his ignorance in the devils advocate.Yet enough! ""Amelie"" had the budget of a TV spot and yet having people we never saw before made a wonderful surprise worldwide..By the way I'm also bored of remakes that stink yet it's a nice way to remember the glory of the originals and sweep our local DVD store to find it.Finally i would recommend Reeves to cast for the next star wars or maybe Superman #3124 and sandra for ""Miss I would never vote # 3124""",The Lake House

Maybe only true romantics can understand the plot.I had no problem following the story line. It had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation. Half way through I figured out a key element, and then I hung on for dear life wanting the characters to figure it out too.I am a true, hopeless romantic. I want every story to end in love. The Lake House did not let me down.By the end of the movie I was not just crying, but sobbing.

My friend thought she dies too and they meet in death.If my version is correct and it seems that that is what a lot of other folks postings believe, how would you explain to his brother that she goes back in time and saves him.

The movie has its moments of wow and moments when all you can do is hold your breath, waiting for the out come of the plot. The move is for all us romatics. It does not matter what age or gender you are. It is a move for all. The hope and magic of this movie has its watchers walking out of the theater with a smile on their face. I watched this move with my 76 year old mother and she loved it as i did. This move can be compared to ""Some where in time ""that stared Christopher Reeves, and also a movie that stared Lindsey Wagner. All three movies delth with love and the barrier of time.

I'm a huge Sandra bullock fan and i like Keanu reeves as much as the next guy... and yes the chemistry they have is very good... but its not enough to mask over the complete lack of storyline and the huge holes in the storyline.... they even miss the opportunity to leave the ending well by taking it on an extra five minutes. in summary this film is really awful and nothing compared to great films of its kind such as the notebook. The supporting cast are quite good but there are no exceptional performances in this film and certainly nothing for the directors/writers to be bragging about. Two examples of the poorness of this film are as follows: Factual errors: Alex makes a big point that in the Lake House, ""There aren't even any stairs to get down to the water."" Yet, in several long shots of the house, we clearly see a staircase leading from the house down to the water.Revealing mistakes: When Kate is sitting at the table waiting for Alex, the candles are full candles.

Didn't ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" make you lose a bit of sleep, even though you logically knew it couldn't happen in real life? That didn't stop it from being a wildly popular movie, right? Superman can fly & Spiderman can spin webs, but I bet you liked those movies, right?

I'm very curious at as to find out if part of the movie have anything to do with this book.I would really like to find out because I want to read this book. I though that the movie was very good, at least for my taste. I know that some parts were kind of off but I think that for people romantics as I am it was a very good drama. I recommended to any romantic person to see it.Thanks.",The Lake House
453,kimbrly_clark,Wonderful,10,2 July 2006,"While the Lake House was slightly confusing in the beginning with the time continuum being off, as you settle into the story it becomes a beautiful tale of 2 people in search of something that seems elusive. My 14-year old daughter and I saw it together and it she managed to get it despite the time thing so don't let that fact keep you home. I love Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves is easy on the eyes so I wanted to see even though we had heard it was difficult to follow...it's worth the slight disorientation if you look deeper and find the true meaning of the story which I believe is ""true love finds a way"". I was also reminded of the book Persuasion by Jane Austen mentioned in the movie and have set out on a quest to find an original copy just to find the parallels in the story. Enjoy!!",The Lake House
454,michelle-e-cox,I loved it!,10,2 July 2006,"I was very impressed with the complexity of the plot. I thought they very successfully twisted the story back and forth through time. The acting was convincing, some of the best I've seen of Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. It was a lot more subdued and sombre than I thought it would be, without much comic relief, but it was very interesting and sparked a lot of discussion after wards. It can really strike a chord for all those who wish they could change past traumatic events. And it's also very gratifying to come across a movie where the relationship isn't based on sex, but real communication and intimacy through being there for each other, while trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I felt very uplifted. My artist husband, who is very picky about movies (quality of writing, acting, editing and filming) really liked it a lot, too, and was impressed with Reeve's performance, especially. We both LOVE the soundtrack.",The Lake House

If they had never met the dead guy in the street syndrome would have made sense.Is the movie trying to show that fate will allow you only so many chances to be with the one you love even if you are two years apart in time? Is the movie trying to show you that you must have a magic mailbox to travel back or forward in time? How come Mr. Reeves can meet with Ms. Bullocks almost boyfriend anytime he wants but cant meet Ms. Bullock? The movie was a nice love story. I just cant get past the ""I can see you on your birthday in real time but after that you will be 2 years ahead of me"".Someone tell me what I did not see, or explain what I am missing.Thankyou",The Lake House
456,imdb-14613,I think I am going to like it.,8,6 July 2006,"First off, I have to admit that I have not yet seen this movie. My rating for it is based on having seen the Korean version (Il Mare/Siworae). I saw it in 2004 and was quite entertained... Based on the reviews here, I'm guessing that the US version follows the Korean one closely. I found the original to be purposefully slow at times... the pacing helps with the mood... which is mostly brooding and thoughtful. There is definitely a lot of incongruity in the script, but there was one really glaring issue that haunted me about the movie... well, actually the house itself... I can't say for sure if the US version has this same issue but in the Korean one, the house sits on stilts and there is no visible plumbing to speak of... where does the poop go? perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree and the plumbing (electricity and phones too)all runs along the the very long walkway to the house. perhaps I should stop dwelling on insignificant issues. Overall, it was still enjoyable and a neat concept. I hope the US version can maintain that novelty of the original. I'm not really a big fan of Romance movies, but around this time in 2004 I received a peculiar email urging me to go see the American remake of this movie... but since it was not released yet, I had to watch the Korean version and wait till now to watch the remake... WAIT A MINUTE!!! I should have replied to that email... I wonder if I die before getting to see the Lake House...",The Lake House
457,skm-8,My All Time Favorite Romance Movie,10,27 August 2006,"My all time favorite romance movie. I was moved and caught up in their emotions, their longing, their everything throughout the story. I wanted so much for their possibilities to work, I rooted for them. It has been a long time since a movie has really got to my emotions and it felt good. I think the last time a movie got to me emotionally -- like an emotional roller coaster, hard to experience but also good to experience was ""Million Dollar Baby"" with Hilary Swank. Hilary and Sandra Bullock both acted these films superbly. I really almost forgot that I was seeing acting, but that I was seeing a real life character. When actors can do that, I am so pleased. I am definitely going to buy the DVD. And I am really picky about the movies that I will buy and watch again but this one ranks at the top for me. I would like to see more movies that get at my heart like this one did. I think this movie would still have been excellent even if it hadn't had the ""happy ending."" The lead characters connected in such a way, without the physical jump into bed Hollywood typical stuff, that the ending was okay but not totally necessary. It was great to see characters connect emotionally, really get to know each other stuff, without all the rushing to the physical stuff. Like in the Jane Austen book, the lead characters really did connect in mind and soul like two close friends, two soul mates. It was rich to experience and I look forward to seeing this story again when I get my hands on the DVD. Congrats to a movie well done.",The Lake House
458,steve_eckstone,Keanu and Sandra fit this excellent film. And Chicago looks great.,8,10 July 2006,"My kind of movie: Romance with a science fiction twist. I also thought Keanu and Bullock had enough chemistry to carry the film. I was surprised that he received top billing, but those Matrix films trump most of her recent work. This is a film, similar to the Bruce Willis film in which the kid saw dead people, that stuck in my head as I tried to put the pieces back together. Lots of twists and turns that are not for the easily dizzied, or for those who require logical connections. Christopher Plummer was, as always, riveting and believable. His relationship to his boys centered the film for me. I must say that they made Chicago (my birth town) look more attractive than any film I can remember.",The Lake House

Plot is a bit unrealistic, but you have to know that going in. It's also a bit predictable. My friend figured out the ending early on, and spent most of her time analyzing what would be happening next, why certain plot elements weren't possible, and so on. If you are one of those overly-analytical types (who expects everything to be realistic), then don't you probably won't enjoy the movie. I on the other hand, enjoyed the film.Bullock and Reeves still have great chemistry together and it is enjoyable to watch them on screen. Reeves has gotten better with age is is a handsome leading man. His acting is a bit better than in his previous films. He has matured quite gracefully and it shows. Bullock's character did not carry her. The movie carried her character. I would have like to have seen act act with more depth and passion. Based on her performance, anyone could have played the part. She didn't make it hers. Although the movie does not have ""oscar"" potential, it is a fun 2-hour escape. I would see it again.

Each of these actors seemed perfect for the part and when they were together they radiated genuine attraction and caring for one another. I found the next to closing scene to be an evocative portrayal of love and longing. Do yourself and someone you love a favor and watch this movie with an open mind and an open heart. You will not regret it.As the movie ended, I said to my wife, ""This is one to own."" She responded, ""Absolutely!"" Few movies make you genuinely glad you were able to see them on the big screen, but Lake House is definitely one of these few.

Sandra Bullock again shows she can be as great an actress in a serious role of a comedy. She is fabulous with her emotions. You can almost feel her passion as a doctor when she loses a patient or has success with another. It is good to see her and Keenu Reeves together again and much better than Speed.

It's a wonderful story about a doctor, Kate, who doesn't have much besides her job and an architect, Alex, who builds for more than the look of the buildings. Kate's moving from her lake house and writes a letter to the new tenant but the mail somehow went back in time to Alex. They write to each other and they figure out they live two years apart but on the same date. Eventually they fall in love with each other and they try to find a way to meet each other. In Alex's time, he bumps into Kate's boyfriend and he invites Alex to Kate's birthday party. There, he meets Kate and kisses her. Back in Kate's time, it is also her birthday and she remembers that she and Alex have met before but she just didn't know him then. They agreed to meet each other at a fancy restaurant in 2006. Kate waits for him but he never showed up and through letters he told her that it was impossible that he wasn't there. She told him that on Valentine's Day, she was with her mom at a park and a guy was hit by a bus and he died and anything is possible. She told him that she needed to move on and find something real. Two years later, for Kate is was 2008 and Alex it was 2006. On Valentine's Day, Kate and her boyfriend went to an architecture company and wanted to buy a house and get their home designed. On the way out, she sees a painting of the lake house and asks the man where he got it. He told her it was drawn by his brother, Alex. She gets excited and asks him how can she contact him. Alex's brother told her that he had died on Valentine's Day two years ago and that he was in an accident. Back in Alex's time, he remembered that Kate had said she was at a park on Valentine's Day in 2006. He rushed back to the lake house to get the letter she wrote to make sure. At that time, Kate rushed to the lake house too and wrote to him. She told him that she knew why he wasn't at the restaurant because he died. She begged him not to go look for her or talk to her. She told him that if he still cared for her, wait two more years and she would be at the lake house waiting. Alex saw the letter but went to the park anyways. He didn't cross the street but just watched her and smiled as the bus that was meant to hit him, pass right in front of him. In Kate's time, right after she wrote to him, she heard a car and saw Alex. They walk slowly to each other and eventually kiss passionately and watched the sunset at the lake house together.",The Lake House

Three weeks before I came back to Taiwan, I met a very nice young man who was only 19 going 20 years old very soon. I am sure we had strong affection for each other, but I was leaving soon, and I am a lot older than him--though I never told him how old I was. I didn't think it was possible for us to have a future because I wanted to settle down, and I don't think it was his time to do so. So I kept my affection for him as my secret, and never told him how I felt about him. After I came back to Taiwan, I tried to keep in touch with him, but somehow, we were just not meant to be. We were both busy and were moving around, so we lost contact for a while. Finally, about a month before his 21st birthday, we got back in touch. I was so happy then. We exchanged a few e-mails, and the last one I received from him was one week before his 21st birthday. The last thing I remembered was I said and did something silly which could have offended him on the phone, and I didn't get to explain it properly. So after his birthday, I never heard from him again. I thought that I offended him, that's why he never got back in touch with me again. I was sad, but to me, he was too good to be true anyway. So I didn't think too much of it, and just moved on with my life. At the end of May this year, I occasionally read the diary I had kept during the 3 weeks with him, and all my affection for him came back. I started to google him. After trying hard crazily for a month or so, I finally confirmed that he died on his 21st birthday. An instant heartache caught me upon hearing the news, and I can't believe that I didn't know about his death until 8 years later! I still hope that I had found the wrong guy who happened to have the same name.... After watching ""The Lake House,"" I also wrote him e-mails to warn him. Who knows, there are always mysterious things. What surprised me about the movie was it took place in Chicagowhere he was from. Although I know he wouldn't be able to receive my e-mail ""physically,"" I still write to him from time to time. And now I can finally tell him how I felt about him. I love this movie because in a way, my dream came true in the movie.",The Lake House
471,cjwa0405-1,Don't like the ending.,4,2 August 2006,"The happy Hollywood ending does not buy it for me. In the movie there are two worlds. Alex's (reeves) and Kate's (s bullock). At the end, the two worlds come together as portrayed by Alex coming back from the dead. I can't make sense of it and is a big hole in the plot. The producers must have had a big debate over the ending.Lake House takes a very similar approach to Il mare (the original) except for the ending. Now that people have seen Lake House, you all should see how the movie should have ended as it did in the original. Had Lake House ended like Il Mare, the two worlds would have been kept apart, which would be consistent to the notion of the film, Alex would still have been dead in Kate's world but be saved from the accident in his own world.I am quite displeased that Lake House could not reproduce the beauty (or tragedy) of the original.",The Lake House
472,Meggie-Ma2006,True Longing...,9,4 August 2006,"This has to be one of the most romantic movies I've seen in my life. I loved it. It describes what is true longing between two who are meant for each other. It might not work out as we wanted in the beginning. Com'on guys don't try to work out the time issue. It's a romantic fantasy. I really like this kind of fantasy movies. I think Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock did very well. Anyone with a sense of romance would love this. Otherwise, they might think it's boring to them. This movie depicts a long distance relationship which is pretty common these days as people become more mobile. People who has gone through this kind of relationship would definitely feel the frustration the lovers had. Not every pair would work out in the real world. But let's not give up hope! Every cloud has a silver lining.",The Lake House

474,jacky42,It kept me awake half the night,4,8 August 2006,"I saw this film last night. (In Germany, you sometimes have to wait quite a long time before they are shown with the original sound track.) Having ploughed through the first comments here, I can't believe that I was in the same film as everyone else.An avid chick-flicker, I was annoyed to realise when I went into the theatre that I didn't have any Kleenex with me.Never mind - they weren't necessary. There was, to my mind, no chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, who played the same characters as they always do. Well, Keanu Reeves did have a good cry, which as Neo he probably wouldn't have, and a laugh at one point, likes dogs, is fairly normal. But when he told his brother he loved Kate, it was so unconvincing, I'm not surprised his brother pulled that face.Those two are better off racing around in marauding buses.The loopholes in the time story left me with an uneasy feeling; so much so, that I spent half the night analysing them and wondering why the story was so much garbage.Now, don't get me wrong - I love ""Back to the Future"" which is pitted with time-travel boobs and loopholes, but that film compensates for that with humor and making fun of itself generally.The Lake House - as someone mentioned - never explains WHY this time slip happens. It is never quite clear what can pass from one time stream to the other - things in the mailbox, obviously - but the dog? There's always only the one dog. So the dog doesn't meet herself when bringing the two characters together (spatially, not temporally), so she slips from 2004 to 2006 all the time. Does she lose the 2 years age in the transition (remember the vet's report).? But what really stumped me was that the brother Henry at the end of the film says that Alex died 2 years ago. Which means that the last scene is Valentine's Day 2008. Sandra/Kate goes back to the Lake House then - the fact that it is not 2006 is made quite clear to us, as a great point is made of the fact that Valentine's Day 2006 is unusually hot and she is wearing a distinctive orange tee shirt. So where was Alex between Valentine's Day 2006 and VDay 2008? According to his brother, he was dead. If, however, the last scene takes place on Valentine's day 2006, which it does from Alex's point of view, why is it cold and windy, Kate is wearing a coat, and how does she get from the town centre to the lake house in next to no time? At this point they finally get together in real time. Or are they now both in the past? Or in the future? It can't be 2008 (where she is coming from) because we do not see her telling him to meet her there on Valentine's Day 2008. And anyway, he'd have been dead 2 years by then. Are they in 2006? If so, why is she not wearing the orange tee shirt and why is it so cold? Are they in 2004? No, hang on - she had long hair in 2004.Then I started wondering about the tree and the box. The tree he plants some time in 2004, and it appears only at the parallel time (judging from their correspondence) in front of her house. (Did you see the size of it? Would a tree grow that much in 2 years?). However, she mentions in her first letter right at the beginning, that the box is in the loft. Surely that should only have appeared at the point in parallel to the point in 2004 when he put it there? Shall I go on? If the box was in the loft when she moved in, were the letters that she had written in there? Why didn't she ever look inside the box? Once they had figured out what was happening, why didn't she just write to him to make more of an effort to find her in 2004, prise her away from that ghastly Morgan character, and just start a relationship then? During the film, I was untouched by their so-called emotions, and afterwards, these inconsistencies in the plot niggled at me and ruined a good night's sleep.For those who can conveniently forget all these anomalies I still can't agree that it was well-acted or a convincing film. The scenes between Alex and his father were not sufficiently played out, and the conversation with his brother at the lake house was confusing and a non sequitur - the only mention of their mother as a person. The relationships Kate/Morgan and Alex/Mona were even less convincing.And all this despite the fact that I admire David Auburn as a writer, and enjoyed the dialogues. Great photography, too - the see-through house on the lake, the light, the charming hidden corners of Chicago, the portraits - particularly of Keanu with his father.",The Lake House
475,britt-elli,The movie would have been PERFECT without that ending..!,9,11 August 2006,"To me, The Lake House would have been a perfect story if it had ended just after Kate (in 2008) sees Alex's sketch of the lake house at his brother's firm, and realizes that he was the man that was hit by the bus. When she ran out of the building with Morgan on her heels, I was sure she was on her way to the hospital to check the name on that file. Then the movie would have been the perfect metaphor of how people can touch each others' lives without necessarily having to ""have"" each other. Even if the film had ended with Alex having died, he would continued to have a profound effect on the rest of Kate's life. Like the lines Kate read from ""Persuasion"" - without even having developed a romantic relationship, they were as ""one mind, one soul."" Sometimes that experience is enough to change our lives for the better. In our day and age, though, it seems like people are never satisfied until they ""own"" and ""have"" each other. We seem to have forgotten what it is like for souls to touch, forever changing another's life in that touch. Kate and Alex BOTH had that life-altering experience, way before the ending of that movie. :)",The Lake House
476,axcesorize,The best movie in years!,10,12 August 2006,"The Lake house is by far the best movie I've seen in years. I loved the storyline which made it so much more interesting than just same old usual stories. The complexity of the time issue really grabbed my interest and I couldn't help but sit on the edge of my seat eagerly waiting to see how the story unraveled, the other was the amazing chemistry between the characters. I thought Keanu and Sandra were absolutely fantastic in it. It really tugged at the heart strings and I went back again for the second time today to see it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. We need more beautiful stories like this one and I think it would be a shame if others viewed this as just another 'mushy' movie.

477,sleepless_in_sg87,only if you believe in destiny...,10,12 August 2006,"i believe in destiny. watching the movie ""the lake house"" today proves it. starring keanu reeves and sandra bullock. location setting of the movie is chicago. yes! like its meant to be, considering the fact that i came back from chicago just a few days ago. watching scenes of chicago is like reliving the past few days when i was there. an experience i will never forget (the great buildings, the skyline, the river, the people).i love this movie. not only because of chicago, but also cos it's romantic and involves fourth dimensional time. i'm a true blue sucker for these sort of elements. two people: Alex Wyler (a frustrated architect) & Kate Forster (a lonely doctor). two years apart: 2004 & 2006. despite the unfortunate space of time, how they fell so deeply in love. and how they attempted to meet. lots of clever twists to the tale. and yes, nothing like throwing in a tear jerker subplot of Alex's dying father, and literary references to Jane Austen's Persuasion. it's all about destiny. how things will happen the way they're meant to be, and if you believe they're going to work out for you.keanu reeves and sandra bullock still have strong chemistry between them since ""speed"" (1994). this is the year's best romantic movie so far. if you believe in destiny like i do, you will love this one. yes, yes, i'm a softie and a die-hard romantic... by the way, if you intend to watch this gem don't forget your Kleenex.",The Lake House
478,sandrilene,Entertaining - but not as good as Il Mare,7,12 August 2006,"I made it a point to re-watch the Korean original Il Mare the day before I watched The Lake House so that I would be able to compare the two. I enjoyed Lake House and as far as performances go, I liked Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock as much as I did Lee Jung Jae and Jeon Ji Hyeon. Still, I think it was in the filming, editing and overall scripting that sees Il Mare winning hands down. The Lake House, while entertaining and nice enough, loses the innocent and whimsical quality that made Il Mare magical.Some thoughts on why this was so: - The house. Il Mare was quaint while the Lake House was impersonal. In fact, this was also a point made by Alex (Keanu Reeves) in the movie. He said that the house was made for ownership but was not a home. Hence, it struck me as funny that Kate (Sandra Bullock) would find the Lake House the place where she felt most like herself. No such problems with Il Mare. The house truly WAS quaint...and magical. The letter box. The letter box in Il Mare was made of wood and beautifully carved. The one in Lake House was just...a letter box. In fact, it looked beaten-up and weathered. Of course it looks realistic - but it takes away the magical quality somewhat.The physical interaction between the 2 leads. There was none in Il Mare - which added to the desperate and aching loneliness of Sang Hyun and Eun Joo (Jeon Ji Hyeon) - especially for Sang Hyun, when the closest he came to Eun Joo (apart from the ending) was at the train station when he sat next to her on the bench but did not talk to her as she was the girlfriend of another man. In Lake House, Alex not only had a heart-to-heart talk with Kate but even danced with her and kissed her. Somehow, that also lessened the poignancy. I felt very deeply for Sang Hyun but not for Alex. And really, isn't it a rather crummy thing to do to be kissing another guy's girl at the surprise party the said guy threw for that girl? Sang Hyun was even willing to help Eun Joo save the failed relationship with her boyfriend but Alex homed in on the girl when she was still with another guy. Of course one could argue that Eun Joo was in love with her boyfriend while Kate never quite felt the same way about Morgan, which brings me to my next point...Kate's character. She seemed to me to have led Morgan on. I mean, if you don't love the guy, then why ""settle"" for him? Yet Kate, in her loneliness wasn't fair to Morgan, deciding to choose him when her heart was really still with Alex. Eun Joo felt she was still in love with her boyfriend and wrote to tell Sang Hyun so though she knew it would pain him. But at least she was being honest and apologised to Sang Hyun when she found out that she still could not quite forget Ji Hoon. Kate leading on Morgan (annoying though he was) somehow made her less admirable.The incessant talk in The Lake House. One of the things I really liked about Il Mare was the stillness of the movie. There were scenes when Sang Hyun and Eun Joo would just be doing things alone, in silence, with no talking. This again magnified their solitary state. The Lake House seemed to be afraid of silence. There was talk and action ALL THE TIME as though Hollywood was afraid that we wouldn't get what was going on.Annoying love rivals. Apart from Morgan, there was Mona. Yes, I know we are supposed to root for the leads, but really, would Mona be much of a threat anyway? The girl in Il Mare (whose name I forget but she was very pretty and sweet and acted by Choi Yoon-yeong) was the one who helped Sang Hyun build the house he dedicated to his true love after he died.And I think that encapsulates the whole problem of why I like Lake House a lot less than Il Mare. The type of love showcased in Lake House seemed to be of a more selfish variety. In Il Mare, it was selfless. The one time Eun Joo was knowingly selfish (in asking Sang Hyun to stop her boyfriend from leaving her when she knew Sang Hyun's feelings for her) it turned out to be a huge and crushing mistake that had tragic consequences. In The Lake House, Kate and Alex were finally together when Kate made the self-serving decision to dump the guy she had promised to marry (albeit saving Alex's life in the process).Just like the 2 houses. Il Mare, the wooden childhood house come to life by the sea, had a whimsical and magical quality about it that reflects the whole tone of the movie. The Lake House, all glass and metal, rings cold and hollow even as it appears attractive.",The Lake House

Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are awkward, and do not act well at all. The plot is extremely predictable (my girlfriend picked the entire sequence of events in the movie within the first 10 minutes), and you find yourself not caring about characters at all. What an utter and total waste of time. As it is, I don't really like romantic movies, but if they have some kind of wit, some kind of originality, then they are at least watchable.

484,chem_ruth,The Lake House is such a snooze,1,25 August 2006,"One thing I did not like about the Lake House is the lighting of the whole movie.. gray and dark, which literally put me to sleep. I found myself dashing in and out of the room to get snacks and wishing the movie would end sooner than its 98 minutes. It dragged on only to give a very predictable ending. If you liked ""Sleepless in Seattle"", this movie is perfect for you as you wait and wait and wait for the 2 characters to get together. This is certainly not one of Sandra Bullock's better performances. ""Hope Floats"" had more meaning and purpose, though predictable. Bullock was hilarious in Miss Congeniality. Keanu Reeves was more exciting in ""Sweet November"". Overall, a thumbs down for performance and plot.",The Lake House
485,electronh-akef,Beautiful,10,26 August 2006,"Absolutely loved this movie, it had my hand over my heart at times and my eyes were glued to the screen. It's definitely a new idea for a romantic, and though unbelievable you get caught up in it and forget about trying to comprehend how it happens.At first, your still trying to understand what's going on, and explain it, but then the events take that off your mind. And even though at times things are predictable, they are still surprising if they happen, probably from how well the performance is. Anyway, this is definitely a movie worth watching and not the usual romantic with a repeated story, and a great thing is that it's a very sensual romance, not physical.

The director proposes a very interesting perspective on the way that the loneliness of two unique hearts can change their definition of love: love can transcend the barriers of time.

494,ndm13,"Entertaining move, but with one major flaw",7,28 September 2006,"This movie was surprisingly good, since I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, Keanu or Sandra Bullock. The movie took an implausible, sci-fi plot and made it interesting to watch. The acting was sobering, authentic (minus a few scenes) and meaningful.**Spoilers**Two things ruined it for me though. It became obvious not too long into the movie that it was Keanu's character who died in her arms the day she was in the park with her mom. This was in 2006, well after she had already met him for the first time (in 2004 when his dog happened to run into her then boyfriend, after which her boyfriend invited him to her birthday party, where they then kissed). So the day he got hit by the bus she didn't know of the romance via the letters yet, but she did know who he was, meaning that as soon as she figured later in 2006 that it was him writing the letters (when the party got brought up and she called him a coward for not doing anything about it afterward) she would have been able to tell him about his impending death. (And since she saw him die, she would know that he couldn't make the date they made later in 2006.)It can only be for cinematic suspense that she didn't realize that it was him who got hit by the bus until 2008, when his brother told her he was dead. The only way to avoid this plot flaw would be to make it so she never saw his face when he got hit by the bus in 2006  then she could put the pieces together later, and would have no way of knowing what happened to him until his brother told her.It would still be a stretch, since he'd have to go back to the house on the day he was to die (Feb 14, 2006) in order to get the letter (because she realized she needed to write it exactly two years later on Feb 14, 2008). But that's not too hard to swallow since the movie's premise is fantastical from the beginning.The second thing was minor: how the hell did the book that he picked up on the bench at the train station get under a floorboard in her new apartment?

It was epic and just like ""My best friends wedding"", ""Ghost"", and ""dirty dancing"" were all great movies that moved and captivated it audience during their times, The Lakehouse was refreshingly new. Its concept was different compared to any other romance i've seen and it was just overall a GREAT movie. i will certainly buy this movie and recommend to others! Keanu Reeves plays the man all women dream of in this movie and Sandra Bollock plays the busy woman of today's world, no time for nothing other than work.

After a few more letters they realise that they are living 2 years apart, Alex in 2004 and Kate in 2006.The lake house was built by Alex's father, who is also an architect, for his mother. They have a very troubled relationship as his father didn't agree with the decisions he made about his future.Kate was drawn to the house because it was the only place she can escape to from her hectic life. She is very close to her mother and she usually reads the books that her late father used to buy.They realise one of their connections is the dog that lives with both of them.

506,sillyrabbit77,This is ridiculous.,2,7 November 2006,"Here's the actual cause-effect chain of events as it would happen: Kate realizes that Alex is the dead guy, hit by the bus.Kate writes him to warn him not to go and look for her, but to wait two years.Alex does so to protect his life. Alex never gets hit by the bus.Kate never sees the anonymous ""guy"" (Alex) get hit by the bus, so she never gets depressed by not being able to save him (she would have recognized him at the beginning of the movie as the ""Alex"" guy she kissed at her birthday party two years prior, anyway -- another ridiculous point that is never addressed) and never goes to the lake house to begin communication with Alex in the past.Alex never gets to know Kate through that communication, so he is never in any of the places that we see him throughout the movie (the ""walk"" together around town with his little note at the end of it, the party, etc., and definitely not at the plaza on Valentine's Day.) By saving his life, Kate essentially would have instantly had no recollection of him or communication with him at all, and the entire thread of time-space would have placed her immediately elsewhere (probably with Morgan), totally oblivious of Alex's existence, and Alex would have gone on to form Visionary Vanguard with Henry, totally oblivious of Kate's existence.Furthermore, if Kate and Alex never started their communication through the ""time portal"" mailbox, as the chain of events above states, Alex would have no reason to attend Kate's birthday party when he is invited after meeting Morgan when Jack runs away, as the name ""Kate"" would mean nothing to him. Thus, Kate and Morgan would never have moved into the lake house at any time in the past, so she would have no recollection of a lake house, much less a mailbox/time portal, much less Alex himself. She would have never known Jack, and the only interaction between ANY of them would have been Jack's running away to Morgan's front door, and Alex's brief, meaningless run-in with Morgan.So Kate never would have sent any correspondence to Alex or anyone else through the lake house mailbox, so she would never have had to save Alex, but that's OK, because he wasn't there for the bus to hit. Cycle complete, happily ever after.Overall, it was a typical Keanu Reeves BOMB. He hasn't had a good role since Bill and Ted's. And yes, that includes, in my opinion, The Matrix's ""Neo."" I'm surprised they got Sandra Bullock to play opposite him. Way beneath her intelligence level. ""Speed"" must have been a real good time for her.To address the comments that proclaim ignorance on the behalf of the movie's critics who state its ""implausibility"":It is not the fantastical nature of the plot overview, in that it attempts to incorporate time travel as a theme, that is repulsive to fantasy lovers, or that draws such harsh criticism.Here's the problem that intelligence has with this film. The plot is not concerned with staying true to its own rules of cause and effect. It's that simple. Focused on drawing tears from young girls' eyes, it is a romance that completely forgets the logic of its own endeavor: When you make a movie about time travel (whether it's a person OR just messages through a mailbox), and you make changes in the past, it affects the future. You must consider holistic as well as fragmented causation, for the parts ultimately and linearly constitute a finished, although revised, timeline. You cannot cut and paste the changes it will make, you have to consider ALL of them. Movies like ""The Thirteenth Floor,"" ""The Butterfly Effect,"" and the ""Back To The Future"" series succeed where ""The Lake House"" fails in this regard. Therefore, critics of this movie certainly may, without self-contradiction or cognitive dissonance, simultaneously praise fantasy for what it bold-facedly claims to be: fantasy. ""Superman"" does not violate its own established rules or step beyond its own paradigm to dumb down its audience with inconsistency. What is consistent at the beginning of the film(s) is consistent at the end. The same goes for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Neverending Story, Jumanji, Peter Pan, or a host of other fantasy/children's' movies that possess, and proudly boast of, a realm or occurrences that are otherworldly or imaginative. The complaint, once again, is not that fantasy has been attempted. The complaint is that the task of accuracy in the parameters of the cause-effect design has endured one of the following: careless neglect, complete omission, or incompetent butchery. To repeat, the crime is not that the movie is implausible in scope, but in its outcome. The problem that the movie makers faced is that the outcome that they wanted, and that the audience wants, is incongruous with the outcome as it naturally unfolds according to the causation chain. Consequently and regrettably, they opted to make 2+2=13 or some such analogy.In conclusion: Let fantasy be fantasy, but remember that it must, too, unconditionally obey its own individual and customized ""non-negotiables,"" clearly set and understood by its audience, a group of rules for which time causation is the primary (and missing, or abducted) poster-child in ""The Lake House.""",The Lake House
507,onnozen,"Stuck on a plane, I preferred to sit in the dark than finish this movie",1,9 November 2006,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen for a while. I had nothing else to do and was stuck on an aeroplane in front of the screen for hours, but I couldn't stand it. It's the only in-flight movie I've stopped watching, and I've seen some pretty bad ones. I don't mind romantic movies, I don't mind stupid movies, but stupid romantic movies are hard to stomach. I didn't see any ""chemistry"" at all, except the chemistry of paint drying in the ""paw prints"" scene. And on that point, why does it take Kianu about ten seconds to chase the dog as it paints paw prints all over his new house? As far as the acting goes, I don't actually mind either of the main actors, but this script was awful, the acting was terrible. Not much else needs to be said really. The chemistry between Kianu and his brother would have been better if they had the roles of Bill and Ted instead. As it was, it was more like Bill and Ted trying to be serious which doesn't work.The point where I decided I could stand it no more was where the writer or director got tired of doing the I write/you write/I write thing with the notes and just had them wandering around their houses chatting away as if they were on the phone. I suppose that scene was there to show that they felt a ""connection"", but please... when the movie itself is so unbelievable, and then you wander outside the lines that are the framework for the plot, it just breaks any fraction of belief in the movie. The acting ruined most of it, the script and plot ruined the rest.I don't think a movie has to keep all the laws of physics, but when they are broken, they should be broken consistently, and there were also many problems with the time travel. Like, if it was there in 2006 then it was also there in 2005, and in 2004, and he would have clogged up his own mailbox with the mail waiting to be there by the time she picked it up. Not that it matters that much, but it would have helped if they had made it a bit more magical, because it sure wasn't realistic.About halfway through I looked across at my wife to see what she thought and she was shaking her head at the screen. I asked her later, and it turned out she wasn't even listening to it. Just watching it was bad enough.As to the reviewer who said ""if you don't like this movie you must be a complete idiot or a heartless bastard"", I believe that speaks volumes about the quality of some of the reviewers who gave this film 9 stars.",The Lake House

I think it was written well, directed well and the actors/actresses where excellent! I am a little biased because I do like the two main stars in all their movies, but the movie itself was actually very deep and well made. I even took the time to research the writer (David Auburn). He's a play writer and I like his work. If he wrote books, I would start reading them because I like his work. The two personalities were a perfect match. The creative architect who likes to use his hands with his work and the doctor who likes to help people with her hands but is more a realist. They are opposites and yet are also complimentary and with major commonalities. It is a very convincing match! I think the writer did his research well. Keanu wasn't the first pick for the part, but thank goodness he was the one who did it. Keanu and Sandra are both excellent actors and compliment each other.",The Lake House

I have been watching Keanu's movies for years and he just keeps getting better the older he gets.I say don't worry Keanu about getting older because you just keep getting better.I believe the whole time plot revolved around the letters. If Kate had not written in one of her letters that she was at the plaza on feb 14 2006,then Alex would never had gone there and would never had gotten killed.So to make it right she had to write another letter to stop him from crossing the street so he would not die.

513,Pinkmoon2,Very nice film,10,24 February 2007,"Great movie. I really loved it. One of my favorites. It's true that there are some unanswered questions about the time thing, but who cares And actually, trying to understand is funny The fundamental quality of the film is not in the time thing. It's in the ""reality"" of the whole thing. The characters are real. The places are real. Second roles are real. The story, strangely, is real, both simple and complex. Subtlety is a key-word for the film. The vision of Chicago is very subtle. I lived there for many years, and it is exactly like that : lively, quiet, cold, cool, distant, relax The acting is sooooo subtle : from the small parts to the leads (a special mention to the hostess at the restaurant Il Mare : I loved her !). Bullock, of course, is wonderful. She doesn't overact : she's very mature, strong, fragile, lonely, friendly, very complex. Reeves is great. I can't stand those critics against him, and his supposedly ""wooden face"" I would have liked to be a man like him. I like him when he laughs, I like him when he doesn't do anything, even when he looks awkward ! I like him much more than those so-called ""great"" actors who make a hundred different faces a minute (useless and boring way to act). Reeves, in the movie, looks like a nice person, a person I would like to talk to. And it is mean (and unfair) to degrade him constantly as an actor Other great elements of the film are the soundtrack (subtle), and Jack, of course. A film with a character like her (so complex too) is evidently lovable. And I would like to finish by saying thanks to the director. I suppose he's responsible for most of the choices. Thank him for doing a film like this, so simple, intelligent, sweet and intense. A film that I loved even more after I've watched it 4 or 5 times. I'm sad that it wasn't more successful at the box office. But I'm confident about its success in the future ! (I would have liked to say more but I'm not an English-speaker, so)",The Lake House
514,tdigiano-1,Let's have fun with the time line.,10,9 May 2007,"As long as we realize this is a fantasy movie, let's try to have a little fun and apply theory on how this could be possible and make it, at least, plausible. Since Kate is always ahead of Alex by two years, let's start at February 14, 2008. Kate and Morgan are at Visionary Vanguard Associates where she learns, from Henry Wyler, that Alex was the man struck by the bus at Daley Plaza on February 14, 2006. Kate, (who Alex has been writing to basically after February 14, 2006), has until February 14, 2008 to change history in Alex's time line on February 14, 2006. You have to remember that everything, in Kate's time, has happened even Alex's death but Alex hasn't gotten to that point in the day yet. Kate has to warn Alex not to cross the street. Once Alex heeds Kate's warning, history was changed in Alex's time line. Now here are Kate's words. ""Wait for me, wait with me, wait two years, Alex, come to the lake house, I'm here"". We see Alex standing on the sidewalk still alive. Now what does he have to do to catch up to Kate on February 14, 2008? Simple. During his time line of February 14, 2006 to February 14, 2008, he must ""dissapear"". He can't alter Kate's time line. Even though he is alive when Kate is waiting for him at Il Mare, Alex knows he can't go. He can't do anything that might alter the events in Kate's time line otherwise he changes the outcome on February 14, 2008. Now let's go a little further. Since his brother Henry believes Alex's story about Kate, the girl from the future, Alex must bring Henry in on his scheme of waiting without altering Kate's past that has already happened even his bus accident. Remember, Alex died in Kate's time line, not Alex's. Henry must act as though Alex died on February 14, 2006. He must stick to this story for two years. Alex knows where Kate is on February 14, 2008. Once again, listen to Kate's words. ""Don't look for me, don't try to find me."" In his time line, Alex knows where Kate works, he knows where Kate lives, he knows when Kate takes the walk through Chicago on that June Saturday in 2006, but he can't meet her in any of those places. He can't alter the time line and Kate realizes this too. Once it is February 14, 2008, in Alex's time line, he can now ""reappear"", jump in his truck and drive to the lake house where he knows Kate is waiting. Fun to theorize, huh? Oh BTW, poor Morgan Price has been dumped. LOL. One last question to ponder. Where is that magical dog?",The Lake House

Admittedly, when I first viewed the trailer it appeared to be nothing more than a cheap romantic flick with a hunk (Keanu Reeves) and a pretty girl (Sandra Bullock). After watching this film, I realized first impressions can sometimes be wrong.The plot may be a bit out of the ordinary. But if you suspend logic for an hour or two and believe in the magic of the story, it will draw you into a deeply passionate story. There are some twists that may or may not surprise (especially if you're as quick as my wife).Although Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have had some iffy acting performances in the past, both put in excellent performances that made their characters come alive. Each characters has a very earthy feel that makes them seem real and relatable.Overall, I have to say this is a beautiful movie, from the story to the acting to the beautiful cinematography.",The Lake House
516,sparkyrules,Abysmal,1,20 June 2006,"My husband and I saw this movie together. We were aware of the critics reviews beforehand and decided that we liked the leads in the film enough to disregard their opinions. Wrong! Next time, we will probably give some weight to the critics.My husband nearly fell asleep and he actually enjoys romance movies, being the modern-day metrosexual that he is. Thank goodness for the dog. It was the only thing that kept my attention. I am a huge dog lover, so I was thankful they chose to include a dog as part of the cast. Otherwise, I would have fallen asleep as well or walked out.The way the script unfolded about Keanu and Sandra falling in love was beyond weak. So they exchanged a few letters getting their dates straight and suddenly they're in love? Why? What made them decide that? Made no sense.And that brother! Why did he keep making those weird facial expressions? He really creeped me out.I went into this movie with an open mind, but the time travel plot was not only difficult to follow, it was never explained. They lost me completely when the mailbox flag was going up and down right in front of the leads eyes. That was so completely absurd.I am mystified at the number of reviews proclaiming ""Great!"" ""Wonderful Love Story!"", etc. My theater (Texas) was about 1/4 full and no one clapped or seemed overjoyed at the end of the film as others have stated.

Movies such as ""Frequency"", ""Back to the Future"" and ""Somewhere In Time"" all explain in some way Einstein's theory of relativity and how it affects time. Those films that deal with time need to follow these rules. When a film does not follow those rules it sucks. An excellent example of that is Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"".Let me explain: In the movie Sandra Bullock explains that she was motivated by the death of a man to go to the lake house and that event started all the letter writing between them. If that man had not died she would not have gone to the lake house and none of the letters would have been written. If those letters had not started,and progressed as they did in the film, then Keanu would have never received the letter warning about his own death. In addition, if he had not died his brother would not have been able to warn Sandra that he died on that day two years earlier.You see, Einstein and Asimov both explain that the past can only effect the the future, it can not work the other way around. Everything he did in this film followed this rule but as soon he read the letter and ""waited"" and did not get hit by the bus, then everything in her future timeline would have been negated.But then again he never could have never been at that point. If you are still confused go watch ""The Time Machine"". It explains about death very well and what will happen if you try to stop it.",The Lake House

On the other hand, Alex Wyler is an architect who decides to live in the lakeside house. When Kate leaves the lakeside house, she puts a letter in the post for the next habitant. The letter is sent to Alex, but actually the time is 2 years before she lives. It is like a magic and at first, they can not believe what is happening, but through exchanging letters, they begin to be interested in each other. They write about their dream, work, life, love and so on Although it is impossible to see, they become to love each other and try hard to overcome the time. They decide the date to meet and the date is 2 years later from Alex's age. Kate has been very exciting to see him at the restaurant, but he does not appear after all. Then they are realized how hard it is to withstand the time In the end, lots of miraculous things happen and ! Before I went to the theater, I checked movie reviews by critics on the Internet, because for me, the plot and the screen play is very important. And one review said ""every word has each meaning and it is a hear-warming movie, so I decided to watch it. As the review said, the screen play was great. However, the movie is kind of a slow movie, so if you don't like that kind of movie, I can not recommend. If you like heart-moving and thought-provoking movies, I definitely recommend this one.

I only cried tears of joy as the movie was coming to a close. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have an obvious familiarity with each other, especially as these two characters. THough the actual ""falling in love"" section of the story is skipped over a bit, it's well worth it, as no one cares too much about that. A movie with such a strange and potentially confusing plot, they did a great job in keeping the watcher informed on which time they were watching, whether it be 2004 with Reeves, or 2006 with Bullock.I walked out of this movie, happy and still crying.",The Lake House

Christopher Plummer needs to retire--same grumpy old man in his roles. Puzzling, and I wish that Sandra Bulloch had some lines where she showed some life-- it would have been a little more probable as to why these 2 men fell so hard for her. Definitely should have waited for the release of the DVD, and that way the popcorn would not have cost more than the movie. In the future, Sandra Bulloch might think about selecting a movie where she can finally show some acting muscle, and become what she has the potential to become-a very entertaining actress who lights up a screen, and manages to keep her private life private!",The Lake House
524,mathieu-stephens,Nonsense,3,18 January 2012,"Putting aside the whole past/future impossibilities, what i find most outrageous is the perceived indifference of the two main characters have with the fact that they can talk through time.There was no ""this is impossible and I must be crazy"" moment for neither character. And once they got over the fact that they could actually communicate through time, neither tried to change history by preventing/warning of catastrophic events or profiting from this fantastic discovery like giving lottery numbers for example.Why she didn't seek him out in her won time is beyond me.This movie is a farce and a snore.",The Lake House
525,meganok,Boooo,4,18 June 2006,"Sandra as always was great. She was approachable and a good character... Keanu was not so much. the movie had a good plot, it was strong and driven, the problem lied with its lack of acknowledgment for time passing. For instance in the past Keanu plants a tree that magically appears before Sandra... if time is always moving forward than the tree would have been there since 2004 when he planted it and not just magically appear. And in the end... I'm sorry Keanu should have died. Otherwise the movie doesn't make sense, if he got the letter before he went to see her, then why didn't he show up for dinner that night? why did her leading physician tell her to go to the lake house? it kills the plot and the story.Sandra was good, Keanu... dragged the film down to abysmal levels",The Lake House

Alex is living in 2004 and Kate in 2006 yet through a some kind of ""time portal"" their mailbox they communicate with letters. A relationship grows day by day when it unexpectedly ends one day after Alex fails to meet Kate in 2006. The reason of this non show will be explained towards the end of the movie..",The Lake House

What a wonderful pair of good looking, charismatic actors. She IS a good actress, as long as the projects she is involved are decent. She shows a lot of class. He does a fine job, made me laugh, made me cry, made me care about the character. That is what your job is all about, Keanu, who cares what some critics say?

528,ethjul75,Their chemistry is the best thing of the movie.,10,1 July 2006,"THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.First of all I'm not English so sorry for my mistakes but I wanted to say my opinion.This movie came out yesterday in my Country and I really wanted to see this movie.. I've read your opinions and why not critic's opinion too, but I always have paid more attention to your opinions than the critics.About this movie... well in my opinion is not a movie for everyone..... It could have been better??? yes.. worst???? yes, my advice please accept the two years thing don't analyze it (although I understood the two years gap very well)and enjoy, it has Romanticism, well I would say mature romanticism and from time to time we gotta go and see this kind of movies. People say that is a chick flick, I wouldn't say that... maybe there are a few scenes that you have this feeling but on the whole it's not.The scenes are beautiful, the colours, the visual elements, the music I liked very much.BUT FOR ME THE REAL AND THE BEST THING IN THIS MOVIE IS KEANU AND SANDRA.I must admit that I like these actors since they did SPEED, I love their chemistry and when I heard that they would do another movie together I was really really happy, but don't misunderstand me, although I love these actors I don't like some of their movies and performances. But in this movie I would like to emphasize Keanu's performance.. I remember SWEET November uffff he was OK but something was missing, I don't know, many people like him more in action movies but when he has to play a romantic role, here comes the problems, but in Something's gotta Give I think that he did a great performance but for me the best is in this movie as someone here said this movie really seemed to bring out a different side to his acting and Sandra did a good job too.But these two together when they work together just click, their chemistry is even better.. you can see them in action movies or romantic movies and the chemistry is there. I think that if in this movie you don't have two actors that you root for them since the very beginning, that you believe in them, that you believe that they make a great couple, that they should be together this movie would make no sense at all and more when they only share two scenes¡¡¡¡¡, the chemistry between the actors really moves this movie along, those two scenes were fantastic the worst thing of this movie is that they don't share more scenes, one friend of mine says that they bring out the best of each other I don't know if she is right but I like this idea.They've taken that chemistry to a higher level in this movie. It's funny you can't find two actors more different, two different personalities but as they say it works.. the scene in the porch... I had already heard the Paul McCartney song and I liked it but when you heard that song with that scene is another thing, the song is even better, I really love love that scene, look at Keanu's face.About the other actors, I was really really happy to see Christopher Plummer and I really loved Shoreh Aghdashloo as Sandra's best friend, it was a pity that they didn't have more screen time.To sum up give a chance to this movie, I will go to see this movie again and a message to Keanu and Sandra... PLEASE PLEASE I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER 12 YEARS....",The Lake House

I know I did. Yes, in all four movies referenced, the situation does seem highly implausible. For that is the pure enjoyment, of a great piece of literature or a timeless film. It is because it is fiction or a modern day fairy tale, that we lose ourselves in the story. Upon revisiting my childhood, I can remember reading the ""Three Musketeers"" or ""Robin Hood,"" and imagining that I was a character in the story. The movie was very easy to follow. The transition from past to present, and vice versa was a completely liquid movement. (No confusion present at all.) One could easily identify with the main characters of this movie. However, I did think it an interesting perspective that the man seemed the most romantic character in the movie. I would have expected the reverse. Overall, I give this movie a 9.0. I am ready to add it to my collection.",The Lake House
531,luwall13,I have a soft spot for this one,9,26 October 2014,"This movie is playing on TV right now and I couldn't not watch it. The first and last time I saw this was in theaters. My dad picked me up from school and took me on an impromptu father- daughter date in the middle of the week. I hadn't been begging him to see it or anything so I guess he just wanted to see it and had no one to go with. I absolutely loved it. It was the first time since Matrix I thought Keanu was suited to a role and he acted very naturally. And that Sandy is always so wonderful :). That movie date was always a nice memory for me but watching it now it affects me in a completely different way. My dad passed about two years after this movie came out when I turned 19 and I was completely broken afterwards. It took years to come to terms with the fact my best friend and favorite teammate in the family was gone. This movie has two characters who lost their fathers and it really moved me this time around. It's amazing how movies can come in and out of our lives and mean different things depending on when we see them. It's a lot like music. I will always have a soft spot in my heart for The Lake House. I don't think it's cheesy or silly or unbelievable, i think its a lovely story. Everyone should give it a chance.",The Lake House
532,coppertop05,"Creative, romantic, original... what more could you ask?",10,17 June 2006,"I hadn't expected to see a fantastic film when I went to see The Lake House. Although I'm a fan of Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves just doesn't quite do it for me. However, within five minutes, I was converted. The story was fresh and original -- a welcome change from films that are just re-workings of older stories. This one had it all -- a compelling romance, realistic characters, heart-wrenching drama, and a great soundtrack. Sure, the whole letter-writing thing was a bit far-fetched, but it was the idea behind it that was important, not the means of achievement. One thing stood out for me as a bit of an anachronism **Spoiler Warning**: Though we're never told when Kate's birthday is, we do know that there are two years between the 2006 scene where Kate and Morgan discuss the kiss she shared with the guy at her birthday party in 2004 and the scene of her actual 2004 party when she meets Alex for the first time and we find out that he was the one she kissed; it has to be, because they are living exactly two years apart. That would put her birthday party probably in the latter half of the year 2004. However, the song they dance to (Paul McCartney's ""This Never Happened Before"") wasn't released until September, 2005, when Sir Paul's album ""Chaos and Creation in the Backyard"" was released for sale. Unless the song was available a year before the album's release, they couldn't have been dancing to it at that party. But, like the mailbox thing, I suppose it can be overlooked for the sake of a good story.",The Lake House
533,spiderbyte,Worst Chick Flick Ever,1,22 October 2006,"I enjoy movies of all types, from science fiction to thrillers to the occasional chick flick. Each has its own place in the movie world as long as it's done right.I watched Lake House being a fan of both Bullock and Reeves. Do not be fooled by the reviews of the last few pages of users who all give a 10 star rating. If you are not a forty-something overweight disillusioned divorcée of the female persuasion, you will NOT BE ABLE TO SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE WITHOUT WANTING TO STAB YOURSELF WITH THE CLOSEST SHARP INSTRUMENT YOU CAN SEE. I won't even mention the obvious plot holes in time travel etc, and the overall predictability (I GUESSED THE MEANING OF THE CAR CRASH BEFORE THE CARS HAD EVEN ROLLED TO A STOP...) How about the acting so disgusting that ... let's just put it this way, reading these reviews I began to wonder if perhaps I watched the wrong Lake House, and Reeves and Bullock actually found time to create a second, Spoof Lake House... wherein they used every sappy cliché ever seen in the history of cheesy chick flicks.There is NO chemistry between them, the TRUE-LOVE PSYCHIC-CONNECTION they establish with each other fifteen minutes into the film is the lamest thing I've ever seen, their inside jokes are NOT funny, the dog is NOT funny, the only thing funny about this film is that two otherwise competent actors were able to keep a straight face as they utter their meaningless sappy lines.As for why the critics haven't spoken up as yet, I can only conclude that they were left as speechless as I initially was. Even now I cannot truly convey to you the incredible levels of cheese that take place in this movie. And for all of those who write that you hope Hollywood will produce more of this ilk, I hope for us all that this will not come true.",The Lake House
534,Embijaye,A marvelous surprise...,9,13 August 2006,"Deliciously unrealistic, The Lake House is a tasteful fantasy brought to life by an understated sentiment (portrayed with such finesse) that validates the unlikely story.I'm hardly considered (here goes my disclaimer) a ""gushy romantic,"" but in viewing their scenes together, even I could attest to the off-the-chart Bullock/Reeves on-screen chemistry - amazing. There's little to complain about this film. Direction, acting, dialogue - solid. The only discomfiture I experienced while viewing this movie was the antsy way I felt when waiting through the stretched parts of the story where it was essential to create angst and dramatic effect. Admittedly, I got a little tripped up on a continuity issue at the end. Then, instead of grappling with detail, I tossed natural reasoning to the wind for a moment long enough to simply delight in the essence of an imaginatively charming tale.Yep, I'm not at all embarrassed to say that I've already dusted off a reserved space for the DVD in my New Classics collection...",The Lake House

We like the actors too, so that helped. Sure, the movie is slow but in a good way. It made us want to see what was going to happen in the end. I liked the change in time and probably if it wasn't for that, the movie would have been any other love story. We liked how the letters process worked with the red flag and the weird time shift back and forth.Check it out if you are interested though and give it a chance.

Keanu Reeves who plays Alex Wyler did a great job, and I fell in love with him. Not only is Keanu great to look at through out this movie, his character is what a woman dreams about. Sandra Bullock is as stunning. Her character is Dr. Kate Forester who is tired of her life and looking for a change moves to Chicago. She has been living at this lake house for a while and we see in the beginning she is reluctant to leave. On her way to her new life she leaves a note in the mailbox for the new tenant......and the story begins. The story makes sense and is easy to follow. Even the dog did a great job. Love the dog.

537,HOLTZARZAR,Comparison of two movies,10,23 June 2006,"Good Evening Everyone: I have just seen the movie and I truly feel it is great. Why? Simple: Please everyone go and see the early 1950s movie titled, ""Portrait of Jennie."" Starring Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones.This move is about two people that time allow a short romantic interlude before separating them.Now the difference between this movie and the movie Lake House is that this latest movie has a happy ending. Please, please, please, in order to understand and truly appreciate this movie, you should be a romantic at heart.Lover stirs this movie. Sacifice, trust and time expands the willing togetherness of two people who are patient. Yes, there are trials and tests; however, they overcome them. When you have a romantic heart and love the scenes in this movie and the movie known as ""The Portrait of Jenne"" you may have second thoughts and see the movie again. Remember this is a movie about love; love with its ups and downs.To me the two main stars are similar to the two stars in the 1950's movie. My suggestions are these: Go to a romantic bar, dinning place, listen to vintage music of the 1950 composers, place your mind into Percy Faith's, Ray Conniff and his music and others.Then go and see the movie once move. Oh, high rare romantic movies are being produced these days. Sometimes, it is good to find a decent romantic book, poetry and then go see this movie. So, I am partial to this movie. In some ways it reminds of sceneries from older movies, along with their music. So please have an open mind. Try renting the movie, ""The Portriat of Jennie, or wait until it comes back on cable TV.Everyone have a great weekend.",The Lake House

They were a very mixed bunch and I didn't know what to expect when walking in. All i can say is that I loved it. It is a wonderful romance movie and is reminiscent of some of the early black and white movies.It is definitely more of a 'chick flick' and you do have to suspend your belief when you see it but I think it is wonderfully written.Some of the scenes could have been a little shorter including the shots of buildings, however I don't think they detracted from the overall movie.I suggest that if you love a good romance (like me) then you are going to love this movie.In short, I loved it.",The Lake House

The thing that stood out to me about this movie is that, despite the fact that for me it was a highly anticipated film, it didn't let me down. Often, I get very excited about seeing a movie and hype it up to such a level that I am disappointed.

I just came from the theater and after watching the movie I was surprised with it because it was very nice. I liked it a lot. Even if the time thing in the movie is kind of strange it was very Entertaining and it makes you think about the important things in live. Like love, happiness and family. The chemistry of the main actors is very good and you end up wishing that everything works out for them in the movie. Also the sites that the filmmaker's chooses for this film are quite wonderful, the way they managed to shoot the movie and how they put everything together is very well thought.

I love Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, together and separately, but the director had difficulty conveying the realism in the script. I know, I know. The idea is extremely far fetched to begin with, but they had many chances to show how amazing and incredible something like this would be. Yet every time a connection happened, they treated it like an ordinary/expected occurrence. Mostly in reference to the mailbox scenes.

You RARELY see anymore. Finally, a love story without the smut. It's a movie I can watch in front of my children if they were in the room.

While the original film is very beautiful and dreamy, it has some flaws at the same time. The whole atmosphere of the movie is too quiet, melancholic and sentimental. It was not very well received in the Korean market (actually a flop) when it was first released back in 2000. Later the movie drew huge attention in Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian countries, due in part to popularity of the main actress, Ji-Hyun Jun.But the original concept is wonderful, too precious to throw away. And I am very happy to see this movie finally reborn as an even more beautiful and moving version. Furthermore, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reevees are excellent here.",The Lake House

Their automatic chemistry is clearly shown which is a result from their previous performance together in Speed. This movie can be a tad confusing, if you only saw the trailer, but if you have seen this movie you know that everything is clearly explained and leaves with all answers, no questions.These days most movies have all the same concepts, but this one is untouched. It is a great love, mystery, drama, and in some cases, there is even some comedy included. There are a few parts in the movie worth crying for, like when Sandra finds out that Keanu is the one that died in her arms, when he was hit by a bus. Then she warns him(since she is 2 years ahead of his time, and does not die). She asks him to wait 2 years before he can come and try and find her, and he does. After two years they both go to the Lake House and they see each other. Then they make out and walk inside the Lake House.One of my favorite love stories of all time.",The Lake House

Sandra and Keanu are fantastic together on screen. The chemistry is definitely there. This is a romantic/drama you will want to see again and again. i I definitely plan to purchase this when it is released on DVD. It opened on 6/16/06 and as of today 6/18/06 I have seen it a few times. I've seen ""Somewhere in Time"" and I think this tops that by far. Don't miss out on some truly wonderful acting. I watched ""Speed"" released in 1994 12 years ago, which was the last movie these two starred in to be prepared for the development I knew I would see on screen. They both proved equal to the task. I laughed, I cried and left the theater totally satisfied. It was well worth the wait. I wish these two could do more film projects....together, they definitely seem comfortable with each other.",The Lake House

A story as this of love and time travel has lots of potential, but the story fell flat. I don't mind so much the inconsistency of time travel given that we know so little in hypothesis; they could've made something up and be more original. The script dragged and meandered about half way through. They could have picked a better leading man than Keanu Reeves. It was so hard to watch him emote with the same blank expression. Sandra was good, only wished she had a real actor to work with, then this film would've been redeemed. I wished they kept the Keane song in the movie!!",The Lake House

Either that or on some pretty heavy emotion suppressants. This movie was amazing. The actors all played their characters really well, and each were suited to the role they had to play. Bullock and Reeves had *the* most fantastic chemistry . . . they really made the whole movie come alive, made it believable. I felt like I was really there, experiencing it with them. All the emotions were real, given forth with such a sure belief from both.The movie flowed. It went smoothly from future to past and back again. All parts gelled, and you could actually see how they all fitted together. It was great to see how you could backtrack in Kate's life to where she unknowingly met with Alex, who was in the midst of his life, talking to her.Yes, it was somewhat surreal, but ultimately incredibly enjoyable.

Kate saves his life 2 years later, so... he would have to be alive, right? So why didn't he show up? I mean... you can change the future, but not the past!! Or when his brother tells her that he is dead. He wouldn't have to be dead... got it? Or for example, how can the letters arrive to the past?

Hollywood has yet to give us romance stories that actually have the elements of a good love story. Much less any good movies at all, from chick flicks to cliché stories.So I was sitting in the theater for another movie, becoming bored at all the previews that were about love, drugs, sex, and snakes on a plane. By chance, I watched the trailer for this movie, ""The Lake House,"" and was enticed automatically. Being a teenage male myself, I immediately set my sights on seeing the movie. It was a couple week's wait, with me watching the trailer over and over again. Yes, even the trailer is worth watching again, as well as this movie.It's true that this movie is simply a remake of the Korean version, which naturally has the same greatness as this one. In both, the female lead has just moved out of the house overlooking the lake. She leaves a greeting in the mailbox asking the new tenant to forward her mail to her new address, just in case some mail slips through the post. However, the receiver of her letter, the male lead, finds this surprising, because his father built the house, and nobody's lived in it for years. So he sends back a letter, received by the female lead after she visits her old home. They become aware of the dates that the other is placing on the letter, and suddenly they realize that they are living two years apart, the female lead in the future, and the male lead in the past. The mailbox is their only way of contacting each other, and through it they develop a deep understanding of each other, falling in love. But they soon find out that living two years apart prevents them from being with each other. Their time lines run parallel with each other, never clashing until now. No doubt that a masterpiece like this would raise a few confusions among audiences.I haven't seen Keanu or Sandra in any other films yet, but that was all the more better for me to be surprised at their excellent acting without any bias of my own. While Keanu has to act as one that's stressed by his father and his brother, Sandra's character is the more carefree spirit, of course sentimental at times when needed.While the Korean version makes more sense on some parts, the American version makes more sense on others. But unfortunately, the thought of not understanding a movie and actually having to work in your mind frightens many Americans today, and so they rarely enjoy these kinds of movies. But the true essence of Asian films is about making the audience actually think about the film, and this leads to them becoming closer to the characters and the movie itself.I can leave an action film with a high spirit. I can leave a chick flick with a feed-good mood. But to leave a movie and actually having it stick in your mind is something that Hollywood rarely ever gives us, and I was glad that out of the many films that Hollywood has and will give us this summer, it gave us ""The Lake House.""",The Lake House

It was just a nice, comfortable movie.It was so good to see Keanu and Sandra back together on film. There were three or four times that Keanu delivered his lines so poorly that I had to laugh under my breath, or under my tears; it depended on where we were in the movie.If you're looking for an ""Eternal Sunshine..."" type of movie, this is a wanna-be-but-not-so-thinky-artsy-great version of that. It's actually more ""Frequency"" in feel than anything else.Personally, I saw the movie three times in the theater...in one week. So yes, I liked it. It was also something that week that I apparently needed to do...LOL The first time I saw it, I cried for several hours after the movie. The second time I saw it, I cried from the opening credits until about an hour after the movie. And the third time I saw it, I cried off-and-on when I felt like it.It's beautiful to watch.

554,info-220-630070,A bit complicated plot for a romance / drama... all the more interesting,8,23 January 2015,"This is plain ans simple a Drama / Romance movie. Guys usually dislike this king of movies and so do I, but ""The Lake House"" offers a plot that differs from those in its category. I will review it without spoiling any details besides those in the synopsis. The first time I saw this movie was years ago, when it was released on DVD, and casually I watched it again last night and realized what a genius and complex plot it holds while supporting a straight forward goal for the heroes in the movie: surpass the obstacles between them, completely our of their control, in order to meet. What great obstacle can keep this two apart you say? No small deed... a time gap. Through a series of well elaborated twists and interventions from forces neither characters, and sometimes not even the audience can understand, the heroes and briefly united and eternally separated and the same time.The time lapses, jumps, plot twists and mindsets are a bit hard to follow, which may have gotten this movie a bad rep for some time, but in reality, it is what separates if from its genre. You suddenly feel like you are watching Sci-fi like ""Interstellar"" or ""Star Trek""... and that is why some guys (including my own) has found this title to be quite interesting.If you will be watching the movie for the first time, it will be a bit hard to keep up, but a simple fact will probably help you: remember Kate and Alex are being separated by a time gap, but more than that, their mind sets at the time where the other is. The time machine here? The mailbox... that is their connection.I wish I could explain more but I would give out spoilers. Basically, great pick, this is at its core a chick flick, but guys will be hooked with the loops and enigma surrounding the phenomena the romance.",The Lake House
555,h-a-badham,A bittersweet film that has potential,6,28 June 2006,"I have to admit that I went to this film expecting to see a slightly below average romance, and I was pleasantly surprised. What did upset me about this film is that it had A lot of unfulfilled potential as well as some gaping plot holes and some frankly bizarre scenes. The relationship between Alex (Reeves) and his father was never explored to the depth it could have been, leaving the long conversation between the two men about architecture and light as a baffling and rather irrelevant passage. I can only assume that due to time constraints the scenes that would have thrown light upon their problems were edited out.This is a wonderful concept for a film, and although not exploited to the full it was still a very enjoyable film. The two leads were both excellent. Keanu Reeves does have a reputation for not being a great actor, but in this role I felt he excelled. Similarly Sandra Bullock was very endearing and her character was slightly sharper and more in control of her life than her characters tend to be.Their love story was movingly shown and the chemistry between the two characters, considering that they only meet twice within the film was immense. The supporting cast all perform superbly, and Christopher Plummer is excellent, if rather underused as an ambition driven and slightly sad old man.Moans aside, this is a good film if you are in the mood for some light and slightly bittersweet entertainment.",The Lake House
556,argcragrat,horrible waste of money and time,1,17 June 2006,"You have got to be kidding me. This movie was just painful to watch all the way through. Keanu Reeves was the worst choice for the role. He should just stick to movies like the Matrix or some dumb action flick like Speed where talent and the ability to change your tone of voice are negligible.I don't know what this crap is about Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves having ""great chemistry."" If by that, people mean to say that they are both miserable actors, then yes. this is true. The entire philosophy of the movie was just ridiculous and unrealistic. The ending was also not worth sitting through 2 hours of talentless, monotone acting and an even more pitiable script.I went to see ""The Omen"" with Julia Stiles about a week ago. Even though my audience laughed during ""frightening scenes"" it was 50 times better than this pathetic failure at romantic comedy/drama. I can't believe that a smart and original dark comedy like ""Death to Smoochy"" got taken out of theatres after 2 weeks because people in the states have no sense of humour or intellect, while this thoughtless piece of garbage will sell to a ton of bored couple.Please save your money for something more worth your time (i.e.- anything else).",The Lake House

A lot of true love to share with someone special. I think this movie profiles what many people feel about the love and the life. We're always looking for the perfect love and the perfect person, and it's not clear if we're able to find out them. More than this: Do they really exist? And how we'll recognize them in the middle of the crowd? Well, at least we're trying to love and be loved...

560,ontimetalent,Things to watch for your first (or second or third) time watching The Lake House,10,26 June 2006,"This piece was genuine and about as believable as any 'suspension of disbelief' piece could be because the characters responded the way we all would in their shoes. The beauty of this storyline (and thus the original piece, 'Il Mare') is that unlike many other time travel films and stories, the two key characters aren't separated by a generation or more. Other writers probably skipped the idea of just being two years apart because it wouldn't give enough room to toy with how the two can affect each other's 'present', but there are some things that float with a two year time difference more meaningfully than if they were 100 years apart.Interesting points: Sandra's MD jacket reads 'Kate Forester, M.D.' and she also seems to introduce herself that way at the restaurant, but the credits list her as 'Forster'...no 'e'. Also, Meg Everist was the set decorator, and you'll notice her name as a patient's on the wall as Bullock exits one of the hospital rooms while telling Keanu's character, Alex, about how people from the future wear metallic clothes and read each other's minds. Kate slips just an envelope into the mailbox upon learning about Alex's father, but Alex receives a great big book on the other end. Guess the props master didn't know how big the book would be when they shot her portion of that exchange. ;)Other subtle notes: Morgan forgot to give Kate a valentine's present of any kind, but as Alex and Kate walk toward the lake house at the end, Alex slips a red envelope into her hands...which could be missed against her bright red coat. It's a thoughtful addition on the part of the writer or director. Of course, it helps that Alex had at least two years to prepare for that Valentine's Day. ;) Good eye on the costumer's part...putting Sandra in brown pants and a blue sweater, and having Keanu in a brown jacket with blue pants for the party scene. It adds visual credence to the thought that the two should be a couple.Sappy things that didn't happen: The dog didn't show up at the Lake House in the end. Morgan didn't end up with Mona, nor did Henry. A writer eager to tie up every lose end might have delved into any of those things, but thankfully, they let our focus linger on just the two key characters and didn't go with a fully 'Disney' ending.Final conversation starters: (Spoilers definitely included here) Consider: Keanu was dead from the moment they started corresponding (in Kate's time). There's something addedly touching about that when you think about their walk together, their overall interaction, and the fact that her heart broke for the stranger that died in her arms, wondering about those he'd left behind.The tree hadn't been at Racine until she mentioned the lack of trees and he planted it, but the kiss and death *had* already happened and come up in conversation in prior to when they'd happened in 2004.Would it have been worked if she'd tried to call him in 2006 and found out about his death earlier? Would it have worked if he approached her sooner with the letters and his feelings? The face value answer is no, if nothing else she needed that time to realize her feelings as she stated herself ""I love you...and it's taken me all this time to say it...""Things that had to happen: His death The dog, Jack, running away and bumping into Morgan? Hiring Visionary Vanguard Associates to build Morgan and Kate's new place Alex's drawing The box of letters had to be at the Lake House to give Alex a reason to go there and notice her last letter in the mailbox. He had to move out so she could move in. She had to move out so the 'Dear New Tenant' letter could set the ball in motion. Alex had to redirect his bills to the construction site or else they wouldn't be paid for two years. ;)If you didn't catch some of these finer details on your first watch of the film, see it again.

563,yunsok,"Talk About A ""Long Distance"" Relationship...",9,25 January 2017,"It's tough after reading negative User Reviews for me to accept that critics still expect movies to follow the rules of science or the known facts of the universe. I completely agree with them that a movie has to make some sort of sense or be structured in a manner where you don't feel as though you just wasted 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back in return. But, I simply watch films to temporarily get away from the normal conventions of society and the real world, so I don't expect too much prior.The idea of two complete strangers communicating thru time via mailbox in front of a Lake House is rather peculiar and for you realists, merits absolutely no logic in its finest sense. Living and connecting thru letters separated by 2 years, while realizing they're both falling in love within some unknown void of space doesn't make it that much easier to believe as well. Also, I'm not even going into detail about Keanu Reeves' acting ability, knowing that the last time he reunited with Sandra Bullock was 12 years before their big break, blockbuster movie - Speed. I'm sure you all remember him winning the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. WINK.But, somehow and somewhere, in the imaginary land of Motion Pictures, the movie works. IMO, it's a solid picture, with the giant boulder being lifted by Sandra Bullock's genuine acting skills. Her ability to combine and express an array of emotions in a realistic and believable way even challenges Keanu Reeves to raise the bar on his own artistic work as well. Not the absolute best chemistry between both actors, but the audience is sold and it's a wonderful movie to watch with someone you care about.For me, ridiculous movie plots can be clearly explained. It might seem difficult to fathom, but I just tend to think of it as some kind of divine intervention, the forces of the earth uniting for that one single chance in time to occur, or a giant twist of unknown magical fate. It makes me want to believe that it can happen. A mailbox, telephone booth, or a hot tub, whatever works. It just allows the film to easily move along and I'm biting my nails in hopes that the ending is as believable as humanly possible.BTW, this is an adaptation of the 2000 Korean movie - il Mare (aka Siworae), which means ""sea"" in Italian. It stars Ji Hyun (Gianna) Jun and Jung Jae Lee. Both credible actors with much better professional rapport between the two, in comparison to the lead actors of this remake. The original version is superior, regardless that it has been 17 years since its original release. The plot is almost exactly the same with slight variations and a definite ""must see TV"" if you enjoyed the Lake House or if you happen to be a Korean cinema junkie.IMDb UR#1 (1/25/17)",The Lake House

I can say that Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves haven't lost any of the chemistry we first saw 12 years ago with ""Speed"". P.S.

So when she is there, that is when she finds the first 'magic letter' from two years in the past from Keanu Reeves character. So they start corresponding through time and ultimately fall in love. OK, I'll buy that. But when she figures out he dies on that day, she tells him through the 'magic mailbox' not to be where he died on that day. So he doesn't get hit by that bus and he doesn't die. Then she tells him to wait two years and then meet her at the mailbox (ie that very day she warns him about his impending death) And he shows up. But if he hadn't died that day, she would never have found his letter because she never would have gotten the advice to go back to the house she had sold.

577,onerobert,"An exceptional film, well worth the trip to the theater.",8,18 June 2006,"I saw this movie on Father's Day, largely because ""Cars"" had been sold out! But I was immensely pleased by the performances of the two leads. The film could have been the dismissed as a ""chick flick,"" but that would be a gross error. The characters are much more thoroughly developed than in many other films, which results in the audience actually caring for them -- perhaps not for Mr. Reeves' father, who is the stereotype workaholic. Bullock and Reeves prove to be utterly believable and very engaging, and they make the preposterous idea of ""time travel"" possible. The interplay between the two leads, and the actors portraying Sandra Bullock's physician/mentor, and Keanu Reeves' father, is remarkable. We keep hoping that the Sandra and Keanu finally meet, but the climax is nevertheless surprising. This movie is not ""Citizen Kane,"" but neither is it ""Speed III.""",The Lake House
578,LadyMeka24,unpredictable Romantic...A++++,9,17 June 2006,"I have to say after seeing it last night, I am pleased I saw it. Yes, we all know its unrealistic, but it has a great love story. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves work well together. The last I saw them together would have to be in Speed, so we were well over due and I missed seeing them in movies together. This movie had a few twist and turns that just kept you on your toes. Somewhat unpredictable. Overall, I enjoyed this movie very much, we shouldn't be so uptight that we cant for one moment step out of reality and have a little imagination and creativity. Thats what is wrong with the world today, we cant see or understand anything that isn't black and white...This movie provided a ""GREY"" area, and you have no choice but to either enjoy it or hate it. I truly enjoyed it!!!LadyMeka24, Sylmar, CA",The Lake House

580,OscarNightParty,Casablanca without a war,10,24 June 2006,"I wonderful film that you can just go and enjoy. Sandra Bullock portrays a doctor who plays along with a reply letter she receives having the ""wrong date"", sent by Keanu's character. Since they both, have at one time, lived in the lake house it becomes apparent that they seem to be able to communicate to one another through their lake house mailbox. You can get the details in many other places but I want to say if you are thinking about seeing it, go. It has the potential to be one of the feel good classics. I read one review saying that they were both too excepting of the situation, but I say, who wouldn't play along with the romantic scenario? This movie took me back to one of my happiest memories when my roommate had dressed up has a handmaiden to deliver a note to a great guy friend of mine. Who wrote back after having dipped the paper in tea and microwaving it so it would dry before writing his reply on it. So yes there are people who enjoy the idea of a romantic movie without ten million car chases. There are so many weekends that I would love to go o the theater but nothing is playing, so this weekend was a treat. Hope you enjoy the show.",The Lake House
581,kwong85-2,Great Love Story,10,17 June 2006,"A short and sweet comment. It was a great movie, great love story and a great mystery. I will see it again and will buy it on DVD when released. Some say the plot could have been done differently but then this is a sci-fi love story so the whole thing made sense to me. The chemistry between Sandra and Keanu was perfect just like in their first movie together, ""Speed"". The time thing was very intriguing. Of course, through out the movie I was trying to tie in each of the events to try and figure out what would happen next. It had some cute funny parts in the movie too. It was a clean movie with, sci-fi, anticipation, drama, comedy and romance. It is a movie I would feel good about taking my children to see. I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up.",The Lake House
582,kamakshiswami,Remarkable (Warning: Don't Get Lost),9,28 July 2021,"A movie that will make you believe in magic, connection, and soul mate concept, just one more time. Personally, I don't follow romantic movies and find them unrealistic and unpractical. However, this swept my heart away with its beautiful making and direction. You will wonder what is it about the movie that hits your heart so much and I would say EVERYTHING, from the direction, music, acting, cinematography, colors, connection, to the ACTORS (besides some loopholes that you will notice but ignore willingly).I don't know what to admire the most, the beautiful writing of the writers, or the acting of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Their connection and bond will make you think they had it in themselves at that time. I would suggest you watch it, if you're a fan of P. S. I Love You, Me Before You, Five Feet Apart, or a fan of romantic movies (definitely). If your girlfriend is pushing you to watch some romance, this is the movie you should go for. In a nutshell, either for Keanu Reeves or Sandra Bullock, you must watch this movie at least once in your lifetime.",The Lake House
583,shanecasebeer,Bullock and Reeves Best?,9,23 February 2020,"I nearly gave this movie a ""10"" to boost its average rating here, but decided on honesty this time. At any rate, a nicely understated romance with near-best performances from Bullock and Reeves.",The Lake House
584,ladylikenoother,Don't Laugh...But I cried...,10,27 September 2006,"The Lake House..what can I say....it's a beautiful, beautiful film. I will admit that I am not a big Sandra or Keanu fan (Did NOT like Speed)...but..in this film...I don't know...they were magical....each in their own way. I really don't remember the last time I cried during a film...whether the tears were for joy or sadness. At first I wasn't sure what to expect...but once it progressed...I knew this was going to be different...will they?? wont they??? I kept wondering....kept holding my breath...The movie trailers just don't do it justice...To those of you who haven't seen the film....I will not spoil the movie for you......But just a word of advice....Go see it...it changes you...it did me.",The Lake House
585,denbyu,Doesn't quite cut the mustard...,6,19 June 2006,"As a chick flick connoisseur, I feel qualified to explain why this movie doesn't make it into my list of all time greatest girl movies (and I expected it would).1. What turned me off immediately was the opening credits, complete with drug-era style music and trippy ink effects. How is that romantic? Why did someone think that awful music would get me in the mood? 2. As an overall observation, the characters never really laugh. They don't seem like they're having fun! When people fall in love, they want to have fun, to laugh, to really enjoy the experience. That's arguably why many people fall in romantic love (besides propagating the species). These two people are falling in love not because they take pleasure in one another, but because their individual lives are so miserable that having one another is their only relief. YUCK! Why fall in love if you don't enjoy it?On the same vein, when characters in a movie actually laugh--whether something is funny or they're surprised--it makes the audience smile and think of good times, which creates a good feeling for them when they leave the theater. This movie just made me feel like my heart had been squeezed really hard.3. Going back to my original point, all of the music sucked. Happy, emotional music is what can really make or break a chick flick. Unfortunately, they play the kind of music you wish your spouse would stop listening to.4. The main characters don't get to know one another at all! One moment they're exchanging slightly irritated notes about what day it is; the next moment they're in love. Their ""romantic"" walk through the city is melancholy at best. All they know about one another is the depressing moments in their lives. There's no build.5. Women see these movies because they want to see a man wooing a woman. Chicago architecture is Keanu's only effort, and for pretty much every woman, that would fall flat. His object is in love with him in a matter of minutes of very dry conversation. Then, he stands her up, and she gives up all of a sudden (that doesn't make sense either, if she's so heartbroken about it). The only really romantic thing he does is obsess over her and wait years and years to see her, which we barely get to see, and it's a boring way to woo someone.6. There's the issue of Kate's other boyfriend... he's not at all likable. In a chick flick, you must either hate the other guy, or just feel sorry for him because he's a great guy too. Kate's other boyfriend is completely unromantic, he appears unreliable since he only shows up in town every now and then and Kate is his convenience girlfriend, and their relationship makes no sense. She's unhappy with him because he's a crappy boyfriend, not because he's just not Alex. She's settling, but worse than settling for not-the-love-of-your-life-but-still-loving, she is settling for an idiot. On top of that, he's not even crappy enough to hate! 7. The final scene is junk all around. I mean, the suspense is dead because you know he's going to show up, he has to so thousands of women won't storm the producer's office with rotten tomatoes. Then, they see one another and just make out. There MUST be a final moment of connection when characters are reunited after separation before the characters kiss (like in Just Like Heaven when Elizabeth has her little vision, or in While You Were Sleeping when Jack tells Lucy he loves her). Who sees someone and just starts making out with them? Plus, the kissing was not really sexy or emotionally stirring. Once I saw them together after all of their sulky conversations, I was convinced the chemistry was absent.This film had potential. That's all it had.",The Lake House
