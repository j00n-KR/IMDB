0,Leofwine_draca,Fast-paced mix of dumb comedy and solid action,5,3 December 2016,"The Rock's short cinematic career seems to have been improving as time progresses, starting off with the trashy Mummy films and their spin-offs and then moving on to more decent fare like DOOM and WALKING TALL. WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE falls somewhere between these films and boasts a good, serious performance from the former wrestler, playing a bounty hunter and chef who, unsurprisingly enough, ends up whupping the ass of just about all the bad guys in the movie. Unfortunately, aside from The Rock, this is a very silly film and undemanding film that seems to be pretty much packed with childish humour. The scenes involving the monkeys, for instance, are interminable and obviously aimed at the younger demographic.Another low point of the film is Seann William Scott's turn as co-star. I was just warming to Scott after his turn in American PIE: THE WEDDING (where he was by far the best thing in the film); unfortunately he takes a backwards step here and becomes the irritating bigmouth once again. Scott's shtick is quickly tiring – the dumb 'thunder and lightning' joke played for non-laughs over and over again is a good example – but it's impossible to totally blame the actor, as his part is so poorly written. On the plus side, to make up for this deficiency, we do get another kooky turn from Christopher Walken, playing yet another villain and yet another anecdotal, rambling, philosophic bad guy a la TRUE ROMANCE. Walken seems to be having a ball, and viewers will too, when he's around. Supporting actors don't fare so well. The usually dependable Ewen Bremner is saddled with an incomprehensible Scottish accent while Rosario Dawson (so tough and hard-hitting in SIN CITY) is one-dimensional as the token woman.The problem with this flick is the plot, really. It's so clichéd – recalling other, better films like MIDNIGHT RUN – that every twist and plot device can be seen a mile off. The Rock's reluctance to use firearms is a good example; we all know he's gonna load up and shoot a load of crims at the climax, so what? Director Peter Berg only ever hits the spot when he's dealing with the action, and I'm pleased to see that the many fights and battles – while predictable – lift this film entirely. Without them, it would be worthless; with them, it's worth at least one watch. Beginning with a nightclub rumpus as The Rock takes on an American football team (film fans will also get a kick out of Schwarzenegger's ""blink and you'll miss it"" cameo) and moving on to car chases, massive shoot-outs, and explosions , WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE really hits home in the action stakes, although the frenzied editing is still a detraction; give me the good old days of one-shot fights (think '80s Hong Kong) anytime. Still, the mid-film showdown between The Rock and some martial arts-battling rebels, out in the jungle with vines, brutal super-punches and more, makes the film worth watching on it's own.",The Rundown
1,SnoopyStyle,fun buddy comedic chemistry and lots of action,8,9 May 2015,"Beck (Dwayne Johnson) is a bounty hunter and debt collector who hates guns. He wants out of the business but Billy Walker has one last job for him and he gets his restaurant. He needs to retrieve Billy's son Travis (Seann William Scott) from the Amazonian mining town El Dorado. Declan (Ewen Bremner) is the bush pilot. Mr. Hatcher (Christopher Walken) runs the hellish mine worked by desperate locals. He allows Beck to take Travis for $10k but then reneges. He wants the golden artifact ""El Gato do Diabo"" which Travis has tracked down. The local barmaid Mariana (Rosario Dawson) is also the local resistance leader.There is great jungle action and The Rock has some fun fight action. The jungle fight with the rebels is both thrilling and hilarious. Walken is a fun wacky villain. Seann William Scott and The Rock have great combative comedic chemistry. They're both lots of fun and together they are hilarious. I find myself laughing a lot. The jokes do run out but the CGI action only gets crazier.",The Rundown
2,claudio_carvalho,"Although Being a Complete Mess, It Is Also a Funny and Full of Action Entertainment",7,5 March 2005,"In Los Angeles, the ""retrieval expert"" Beck (The Rock) is assigned by his boss Billy, a powerful mobster, to bring his son Travis (Seann William Scott) back from Amazonas. Beck wants to get free from Billy, and buy and be a chef of an Italian restaurant. Once in the Brazilian jungle, Beck faces Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a powerful landlord of a city who explores the locals in the extraction of gold, and a group of rebels, leaded by Mariana (Rosaria Dawson), to retrieve Travis, who found a priceless treasure called ""O Gato do Diabo"" (which means ""The Cat of the Devil""). ""Welcome to the Jungle"" is a funny and full of action entertainment. There are excellent action scenes and the chemistry between The Rock and Seann William Scott works perfectly. The DVD has many extras, most of them very interesting. In accordance with the interview with Peter Berg in the DVD, he had the intention of filming in Brazil, but unfortunately he was robbed and threatened in the jungle, so he decided to make the movie in Hawaii. Maybe because of this reason, there is a total lack of accuracy in many parts of the story. For example, the unique dialog in Portuguese is when Beck and Travis are captured by the rebels. However, the accent is not from Brazil. The other dialogs are in Spanish. Nuts, usually consumed in Christmas, are imported and very expensive, and they are not common in Brazil. Manito (small brother in Spanish, I guess) is not a Brazilian name or nickname (it would be ""Maninho""). The biotype of the ""Brazilian"" rebels is ridiculous. Mariana makes a reference of the a wage of US$ 0,65 per hour as a reference to the exploitation of Hatcher to the locals. However, the minimum wage in Brazil is less than US$ 100,00 per month. Therefore, US$ 0,65 per hour would be much more than the minimum wage in Brazil, specially in a poor and isolated region like that one. There are no rebels in Brazilian jungles, only in Colombia. The IBAMA (Brazilian Environmental Agency) would never allow that sort of exploration without an special authorization, including a study of the impact of the environment. There also some correct references, like our Flag, the reference to Flamengo, the most popular soccer team of Brazil, the advertisements of beer etc., and the names in Portuguese of the buildings. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Bem Vindo a Selva"" (""Welcome to the Jungle"")",The Rundown
3,jboothmillard,Welcome to the Jungle,5,7 July 2005,"If you like jungle films, and a bit of action and adventure, then this I suppose is worth a look. Basically Beck (wrestler Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) is a bounty hunter, that never uses a gun, and also he aspires to be a chef with his own restaurant. He is hired by mobster Billy Walker (William Lucking) to go to Brazil to bring home Walker's son Travis (American Pie's Seann William Scott), who is searching for an ancient gold idol called the Gato del Diablo. When he gets to the village run by slave-driving operator Cornelius Hatcher (Christopher Walken), Beck finds out he really wants this artifact too, and will do what it takes, even killing, to get to it first. Beck does find Travis, but when they try to get back to the plane, they end up crashing (literally) into the Brazilian jungle, with no bearings, and until Mariana (Men in Black II's Rosario Dawson) comes along, no-one to help them. Eventually they agree to find the Gato, with Hatcher hot in pursuit, so expect some gun play, including (eventually) by Beck. Also starring Ewen Bremner as Declan, Jon Gries as Harvey, Ernie Reyes Jr. as Manito, Stuart F. Wilson as Swenson, and apparently Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Bar Patron. Some good action, some good small comedy, and beautiful scenery, a film worth seeing once in a while. Worth watching!",The Rundown
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Put Your Brain On Hold & Enjoy The Stylish, Wild Ride",8,20 January 2007,"Yup, this is way hokey and one of the dumbest movies I own in my collection, yet it's very likable and mostly a fun film with great style and scenery.An adventure story, played strictly for entertainment value, it mostly succeeds because Dwayne Johnson, better known as ""The Rock,"" is a very likable hero. He's clean-cut, well-spoken, modest, etc. Supposedly this film was supposed to be The Rock grabbing the action mantle, so to speak, from the king - Arnold Schwarzenegger - who will no longer make movies. They even have Arnie make a quick cameo, wishing The Rock good luck! That was a good touch.Meanwhile, Rock's cohort in this film, Seann William Scott, gets by with his sense of humor. It almost plays like one of these ""buddy movies"" except that these two guys (""Beck"" and ""Travis,"" respectively) are not on the same page about anything. In no other film can I recall two characters getting beat up and annihilated like these two guys....but they never seem the worse for wear! Unbelievable!Rosario Dawson adds some female sex appeal and Christopher Walken adds his normal entertaining take on being the villain. His dialog was very good in here. I didn't realize until the second time I watched it (which is where I stand now) just how stylishly this was filmed. This movie reminded me of many made by either Robert Rodriguez or Quentin Taranatino with the gimmick photography. It makes it all the more fun to watch. Add some excellent sound, tremendous Hawaiian scenery simulated to look the the Amazon jungle in Brazil......and you can put up with the stupidness of the story and have a good time.",The Rundown
5,Tweekums,Welcome to the Jungle,8,28 June 2018,"Protagonist Beck wants to be a chef but he can't pay off his debts let alone buy a restaurant so he is acting as a private debt collector for a shady character named Billy Walker. Walker offers him a job that will clear his debts and pay for the restaurant. He is to head deep into the Brazilian jungle and bring back Wilder's wayward son Travis. It won't be easy though; the whole area belongs to Cornelius Hatcher, a mine owner who is brutally using the local population. If that weren't enough Travis doesn't want to go home; he believes he has discovered the location of 'O Gato do Diabo', 'The Cat of the Devil'; a priceless ancient gold artefact. Inevitable, after various difficulties Beck and Travis end up going after the Gato and must ultimately confront Wilder and his thugs.One might consider this a sub-Indiana Jones adventure but that would be a little unfair; the plot may be a little flimsy but that doesn't matter as it supplies action and laughs throughout. Dwayne Johnson, in an early role where he is still solely credited as 'The Rock', shows that he has what it takes to lead an action film; not surprisingly he is great in the action scenes but he is also humorous and makes his character likable. When first introduced I feared Sean William Scott's Travis would be annoying but ultimately he proved to be very funny. Christopher Walken is a great villain and there is solid support from Rosario Dawson as a barmaid who is more than she seems. There is also a small but enjoyable performance from Ewen Bremner as the bush pilot whose strong accent makes him hard for characters to understand. The action is nicely varied with plenty of fights, some gunplay and even bad guys with bullwhips... if that weren't enough there is also a troop of monkeys that prove to be hilariously disturbing. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting exciting rather than brutal action and plenty of laughs.",The Rundown

7,BA_Harrison,My Rundown of Welcome to the Jungle...,7,20 February 2016,"In a blink-and-miss-it cameo during the opening scene of Welcome to the Jungle (AKA The Rundown), Arnold Schwarzenegger hands over his action hero mantle to the only star capable of filling his shoes: Duane 'The Rock' Johnson. While this movie isn't anywhere near on a par with Arnie at his best, it certainly sets Johnson on the right path, delivering just enough OTT action infused with comedy to make it a mindlessly entertaining slice of slam-bang fun.The former WWF star plays retrieval expert Beck, who accepts one last job before becoming a restaurant owner: bring troublesome treasure hunter Travis (Seann William Scott) back from the Brazilian jungle to face his father in Los Angeles. Of course, doing so isn't as easy as it sounds, with unscrupulous gold-mine owner Hatcher (Christopher Walken) refusing to let Travis leave, believing that he knows the whereabouts of a priceless artifact.What follows is a whole load of knockabout silliness, Scott playing comic relief to Johnson's hero, as the guys evade Hatcher's army of hired killers, come face-to-ass with some angry baboons, locate the valuable statuette (in an Indiana Jones style scene complete with booby-trapped cave), and return to the gold-mine to rescue sexy rebel Mariana (Rosario Dawson), who has been trying to free her people from Hatcher's oppression.At 104 minutes, the film is perhaps 15 minutes or so too long, and the ballistic mayhem in the finale—where Beck finally breaks his 'no guns' rule—is of the 'A-Team' variety (i.e., lots of goons getting gunned down, but no blood), but as an introduction to Arnie's successor, Welcome to the Jungle does just fine.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",The Rundown
8,hitchcockthelegend,Head cracking with the Rock and it looks pretty in the jungle too.,6,20 July 2010,"Welcome To The Jungle (AKA: The Rundown) is directed by Peter Berg and stars Dwayne Johnson and Seann William Scott, Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson. The plot sees Johnson as Bounty Hunter, Beck, who heads to Brazil to retrieve his employer's renegade son (Scott) but finds more than he bargained for in the shape of jungle tyrant Cornelius Hatcher (Walken).Fun, exciting, if utterly disposable action fodder that features former pro wrestling champ Dwayne "" The Rock"" Johnson in one of the first film's attempting to break him into Hollywood. This film opens with a cracking opening sequence as Johnson lays waste to a whole offensive line, and from there on the pace keeps on the good side of brisk. Once Big Beck gets to Brazil, and he's coupled with the intentionally annoying Scott, things mellow a touch but the comedy is bright and both actors work up good chemistry. There's a nice cameo from one Arnold guy who passes the torch on to Johnson, and Walken is enjoying playing up to his bonkers stereotypes.In spite of the film not making back its budget, the film has received generally favourable reviews from critics and fans alike. 6/10",The Rundown
9,poolandrews,Reasonabale action film.,5,16 April 2010,"The Rundown starts in Los Angeles where tough bounty hunter Beck (The Rock) decides he wants out of the business to open his own restaurant & accepts one last job from his mobster boss Billy Walker (William Lucking) to make enough money to realise his ambition. Beck has to find Billy's son Travis (Seann William Scott) who has disappeared in an Amazonian village in Brazil somewhere & bring him back to Los Angeles, sounds easy & Beck has no trouble finding Travis but also finds that the guy who runs the town is an evil businessman named Hatcher (Christopher Walken) who uses the natives as cheap labour to mine for gold in appalling conditions so he can get rich & when Hatcher discovers that Travis has found a solid gold ancient statue worth millions he wants it. Beck has to protect Travis who is less than co-operative anyway & fight off Hatcher's men who have orders to kill...Directed by Peter Berg this is also known under the title Welcome to the Jungle (which was it's working title apparently along with Call of the Wild & Helldorado) just about everywhere other than the US this is a decent enough if unspectacular action comedy. I think the makers were trying to make a throwback to the larger than life action comedies of the 80's & early 90's & in particular Midnight Run (1988) as both share the same basic set-up & plot with a typical mismatched pairing of likable heroes up against a bad guy who has a whole army at his disposal, there are the expected fights, the one-liners, a romance subplot, lots of over the top set-pieces including a fall down a cliff that would have broken every bone in your body & a final where the two lone heroes face up to massive overwhelming odds as they are helplessly outnumbered but still come out on top. The story here is weak, it's not even that fun to watch & it feels like exposition & character development was left on the cutting room floor to quicken the pace as we never learn anything about Hatcher, very little about Travis or why he hates his father & a subplot involving some native rebels is over just as soon as it starts & for some reason there are two baffling scenes with Monkeys that I think are meant to be funny or have some relevance but aren't & don't. At just over 100 minutes it moves along at a decent pace & it's watchable but just not brilliant in any regard, the character's are hollow, the action is tame, the plot feels unfinished & there's little here to distinguish The Rundown from any straight to video action flick.My main problem with The Rundown was that the action scenes just aren't that memorable, there are a few cool fights, a shoot-out at the end & a couple of exploding vehicles but nothing else & even the main bad guy gets a lacklustre death. The scenery looks nice I will say that but one tree looks pretty much like any other. There doesn't seem to be too many CGI computer effects here which is good to see & the stunt work is generally good but it did feel very familiar.The IMDb says this had a budget of about $85,000,000 & that amazes me as I can't really see where the money went, sure there one or two decent explosions & some fight scenes but nothing else really stands out. Although set in the Amazon in Brazil this was filmed in Hawaii. The cast are alright, The Rock is OK, Seann William Scott isn't that funny here while Christopher Walken is wasted. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a cameo at the start & Ewan Bremner as the comedy relief Scottish plane pilot is awful.The Rundown is an OK action comedy adventure that has a familiar feel to it & maybe isn't as big as it should have been since the set-piece action scenes really are nothing to get excited about.",The Rundown
10,lastliberal,Never met an American who didn't like guns.,7,9 May 2007,"If you are looking for action, it doesn't come any better than this. This film has one of the best fight scenes in a movie between The Rock and the Kontiki rebels. It also has some of the best stunt work as two stunt men are thrown from a jeep as it falls off the side of a cliff. The stunt men tumble and fall down the cliff, hitting multiple trees and debris. Eventually the two men perform a tumbling 55' high fall into a large pool without the use of wires.But, what it has most of all is the Puerto Rican, Cuban, African American, Irish and Native American beauty Rosario Dawson (Rent, Sin City, Grindhouse).This is probably the best role I have seen for Christopher Walken. He plays Hatcher, the bad guy, and he plays it well.Even Arnold Schwarzenegger puts in an appearance.",The Rundown
11,zardoz-13,"Move over, Vin Diesel, you've got competition from The Rock!",8,29 July 2007,"Sometimes, you can't judge a movie by its title. Take the tongue-in-cheek, tough-guy thriller starring the Rock entitled ""The Rundown."" Essentially, the title tells all in this predictable but lively B-movie with breathtaking mountain scenery, a blockbuster A-movie budget, and Oscar-winning thespian Christopher Walken as a wickedly evil adversary. Imagine ""Romancing the Stone"" minus the tears and romance but rippling with testosterone-drenched action and adventure, and you've got a fair idea what ""The Rundown"" delivers. Usually, Hollywood hypes its larger-than-life heroics with superlatives. Not only does a lackluster title like ""The Rundown"" forego anything in the way of freshness, but also it suggests what follows must rank as downright ordinary and totally unimaginative. Indeed, just about every hard-knuckled Hollywood hero from Stallone to Schwarzenegger to Seagal has starred in this kind of derivative derring-do. Nevertheless, you don't usually see it staged with the flair that actor-turned-director Peter Berg brings to this formulaic fodder. Incredibly, ""The Rundown"" boasts wit to spare and action to bear. What the Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson lacks in acting chops, he more than compensates for with his charisma and crackerjack comic timing. Between the heroic Rock and hard-placed Christopher Walken stand co-stars Seann William Scott of ""American Pie"" fame and Rosario Dawson of ""Kids."" Don't try to count the bullets that riddle this highly improbable but hugely entertaining hokum. If the ""Scorpion King"" (2002) made the Rock into a leading man, ""The Rundown"" should solidify his stardom as an action hero par excellence. Meanwhile, action movie enthusiasts who don't object to a modicum of plot in their films may applaud the outlandish plot reversals and the delicious irony with which Berg and scenarists R.J. Stewart of ""Major League 2"" & TV's ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" and James Vanderbilt of ""Basic"" and ""Darkness Falls"" endow this exciting epic.""The Rundown"" opens with an amusing slam-bang barroom brawl. Berg and his scribes quickly establish the offbeat character of our sympathetic hero, 'retrieval expert' Beck (Dwayne Johnson of ""The Mummy Returns""), as he negotiates with a recalcitrant NFL football quarterback who owes Beck's boss a $50-thousand gambling debt. At first, the QB takes Beck for a fan out for his autograph. When Beck continues to butt into the QB's business, our hero arouses the wrath of the formidable offensive linemen who have accompanied the quarterback to the nightspot. Respectfully, Beck apologizes for his intrusion, retreats beyond ear shot, and calls his boss. Beck asks Harvey if he can forego busting knuckles with the footballers, because they have an important game in the offing. Beck's boss Harvey refuses to accept no for an answer, so our protagonist reluctantly interrupts the QB again. Beck demands the expensive ring as collateral, but the QB balks. When the offensive line confronts Beck, our contrite hero gives the QB Option A or Option B. This hilarious routine recurs throughout ""The Rundown"" and gives the Rock's character some hilarious dialogue foreshadows inevitable fisticuffs. Option A always allows the easy way out, while Option B guarantees similar results as Option A with headaches in store for those foolish enough to reject Beck's first option. Unfortunately, nobody takes Beck seriously until he decimates the opposition with his fast moves and bare fists. ""Guns take me to a place I don't want to go,"" Beck explains his aversion to firearms. Nevertheless, Beck secures the QB's ring as collateral and leaves behind the offensive linemen crumpled up unconscious on the floor. In the next scene, we learn Beck dreams of owning a restaurant. He wants to retire from the strong-arm business. Beck's boss Harvey (Jon Gries of ""Men in Black"") agrees to wipe Beck's slate clean if he will perform one last service. He wants Beck to wing his way down to South America, plunge into the Amazonian rain forests and find his long lost son, smart-aleck goof-off Travis Walker (Seann William Scott of ""Bulletproof Monk""), and haul him back to L.A. No sooner does Beck land in Brazil in a propeller-driven plane held together by duct-tape, than he finds himself imperiled. Initially, Beck humbly approaches the local strong man, Hatcher (Christopher Walken of ""True Romance""), who runs El Dorado, a company town near a sprawling gold mine, like a ruthless tyrant. Beck agrees to pay him $10-thousand, as a courtesy so he can venture into Hatcher's bailiwick with ruffling Hatcher's feathers. Meanwhile, Travis convinces bar owner Mariana (Rosario Dawson of ""The 25th Hour"") to loan him her boat. He claims to know the location of a fabled treasure, the statue of a golden cat. Before Travis can launch Mariana's boat, Beck collars him by surprise. Suddenly, Hatcher appears with his henchmen. Hatcher welshes on his earlier deal with Beck. Hatcher believes Travis knows the whereabouts of the priceless artifact. Hatcher wants Travis, but Beck refuses to hand him over. Clocking in at a trim, vigorous 104 minutes, this enjoyable PG-13 rated programmer never bogs down. Sophomore director Berg (whose first directorial effort was ""Very Bad Things"") and his writers keep our heroes jumping through one flaming hoop after another until fade-out. Berg coaxes flavorful performances out of everybody, especially the Rock who consciously avoids using his signature hoisted eye-brow scowl. Not unexpectedly, Christopher Walken adds another rogue to his gallery of scoundrels and provides the Rock's Beck with a worthwhile enemy. Walken's speech about the Tooth Fairy to his native guards and their lack of comprehension stands out as a memorable moment in the middle of the chase to recover Travis. Scenic Hawaii with its picturesque mountains splendidly substitutes for Brazil and the aerial photography will make your gasp. Move over, Vin Diesel, you've got competition.",The Rundown

14,Aaron1375,Pretty good action/comedy buddy movie,7,24 October 2018,"Saw this movie not too long ago for the first time, and it astounds me that it came out in 2003. Makes me feel real old, and it also was strange to see The Rock not quite as big in this film as he is now. The film had a rather large budget, which is also very questionable as this is the first film that I know of that has The Rock as the lead and seeing it only made 80 million worldwide and cost 85 it did not even manage to break even. Granted, I am sure with DVD sales and such it has made a profit over the years, just not as quickly as a studio would like.The story has The Rock as some sort of retrieval and enforcer kind of guy, but he is tiring of this lifestyle and wants out so he can be a chef. Well, he is given an opportunity to get out, because if he can get his boss's son and bring him back, he will be allowed out of the business. The problem is that his son is in South America. So he proceeds down and proceeds to have a hard time with his target as he is a smart mouthed guy who has no intentions of going back before finding a treasure. They also run afoul of a guy who pretty much runs things in this town and soon they will be pursued as they make their way through the jungles in search of the treasure.The Rock does a pretty good job in his first leading role not associated with The Scorpion King and shows glimpses of the star he will become as he is able to do the action thing good and do well in the humor department too. Sean William Scott is also good as the guy The Rock is trying to retrieve and gives the Rock all kinds of problems. Christopher Walken is also in this one and of course he is good!So, it was a pretty good film when it is all said and done, not sure why it did not do better when it initially released. I have seen far worse films make lots of money over the years, but then, they are sequels and that is why one tends never to see anything original these days. This one had some good action, some good humor and it was a nice distraction while it was on.",The Rundown

The audience laughs at the irony of the situation.The irony, of course, is that Santa Claus is a jolly old fat man, and the hero of ""The Rundown"" is a young, lean, muscular, lethal weapon--the exact opposite of Mr. Claus' unflattering, universally-regarded image.And in case you need an introduction to The Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson, he is a well-known wrestler, son of Rocky Johnson. He is famous for his own unique slamming move and great skills. Obviously I don't know much about wrestling, as you can plainly gather from reading my rather short and uneducated bio of the man.But regardless of any of this, here he is in this movie. The Rock is Beck, a ""retrieval expert."" He is hired by rich people to seek out certain things--people, objects, etc.--and return them to the payer. In the opening sequence he walks into a crowded bar filled with football megastars. After politely demanding a ring from one of the husky players, he is thrown out of the bar by fellow football team members. So Beck gets on the phone with his boss. ""Do we have to do this now?"" he asks. ""They've really got a chance this year!""The answer, of course, is that he must do it now, and what he does is a lot of fun--he beats them up, one-by-one, bare-handed and using only his fists as weapons--evoking a sort of Jean-Claude Van Damme image. Only...better.Prior to this scene, Arnold Schwarzenegger stops Beck while he's entering the bar. He tells him to have a good time with the typical Arnie grin, then leaves. That's when we realize we're about to have a fun time, and it only gets better from there.Beck's newest assignment is to locate Travis (Seann William Scott), a young man who is residing in the Amazon and is worth a lot of money to his estranged father, who wants his son back--for unspecified reasons. Beck doesn't ask questions, he just retrieves what he's told to retrieve--like a golden retriever, I suppose.After making the trip to El Dorado, a.k.a. Helldorado, Beck finds himself being pursued by Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a ruthless millionaire miner who owns much of the land surrounding the area--and wants Travis for himself, so that he can tell him where an ancient artifact lies.So, on the run with Travis and being pursued by Hatcher and his men, Beck is left with few options. There's option A and option B. A is leave Travis and return home, forget his job and open up a new restaurant he's been saving up for. Option B is confront Hatcher, bring Travis back to his father, collect his reward and open his restaurant.He does, of course, choose the latter of the two options.There's a brilliant scene at the end of this movie that sent a strong chill up my spine. Travis is being shot at, calling for help, and Beck is scared to pick up weapons to defend his friend. The director Peter Berg, the former actor, raises the tension by splicing together various images at exceeding speed. And then finally they all immediately stop and we see Beck rise upwards, in typical slow motion, holding two guns in his hands. The audience is quiet and a chill is sent throughout the screening room. We all know that hell has finally been unleashed. After refusing to pick up guns throughout the movie for fear of what may happen to his enemies, Beck has turned on his morals and it's time to kick some butt. This is pure action stuff, delivered with great expertise, and its effect is startlingly powerful.All in all, I absolutely loved it.Prior to seeing ""The Rundown,"" I wasn't sure if I wanted The Rock to be the next Arnold Schwarzenegger. After seeing ""The Rundown,"" I must say that I don't really mind if he becomes half as good as Arnold. Granted, I somewhat doubt if he'll ever become the same box office titan. Arnold was the first of his kind in both bodybuilding and action movies. He's had a lot of pale imitators, right down to the ""muscle men with accents"" category. He is, to this day, unrivaled by any muscular action hero. Just like there will never be another Eastwood, there will never be another Arnold. But as far as they go, The Rock is one of his better imitators, which says something.""The Rundown"" is rated PG-13 but plays like a good R-rated action movie. It's very good and will not disappoint any action fans that feel that the genre has been somewhat lacking recently. After ""Terminator 3"" and ""The Rundown,"" though, it looks like we may be starting to get back on track after all.As for Beck? I have a feeling he'll be back.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",The Rundown

19,Buddy-51,"utterly implausible, but fun at times",6,30 January 2005,"In the opening scene of ""The Rundown,"" the current governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, stops by for a brief moment to pass the torch off to Dwayne Douglas Johnson - a.k.a. The Rock - officially anointing him as the action hero star for the new millennium.In this film, The Rock plays a wannabe restaurateur who finds himself in hock to a vicious mob boss. To work off his debt, the rock-solid behemoth becomes a retrieval expert, strong arming other people into paying what THEY owe to the gangster. For his final assignment, the Rock is sent off to the jungles of South America to find and bring back the boss's recalcitrant son, who is busy searching for some buried Indian treasure and making a general pest of himself. While there, The Rock becomes involved in a small war between a gold miner who has virtually enslaved the native population (who else but Christopher Walken?) and the band of rebels out to defeat him and regain freedom for their people.""The Rundown"" is a fairly standard action adventure film in which the ever-resilient hero is able to pulverize a whole army of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys with little more than his own bare hands and without suffering a single scratch in the process. No matter how many times he gets punched, kicked, stomped on, thrown into the air or tossed over a cliff, The Rock always manages to pick himself up, dust himself off and fight again. Writer R.J. Stewart and director Peter Berg make it a point to emphasize The Rock's humanity by having him rarely use a gun when fighting (and then only as a last resort) and by giving him a homey domestic dimension in the form of his culinary talents. There's something downright incongruous about having a human side of beef beating everyone he meets into a bloody pulp, all the while declaring that he is really opposed to violence on principle. The film is also filled with all the verbal bantering, wisecracks and quips one has come to expect from these big budget action pictures. Some of the humor works and some of it doesn't.Although The Rock has yet to develop his chops as an actor, he has a certain laidback charm that works well on screen. He is effectively paired with Seann William Scott (Stifler from the ""American Pie"" movies), who has a ball playing the hyper kinetic jokester who just happens to be hiding a heart of gold under his mercenary exterior. The two develop a kind of nagging, love/hate relationship that generates a few laughs along the way. Rosario Dawson, with her seamless, pearly white teeth and perfectly coiffed hair, is far from convincing as a woman who is a bartender by day and a jungle-dwelling revolutionary by night. She is so grave and serious in her overall demeanor that she seems to be acting in a whole other movie entirely.The Rock has a long way to go before he finds a vehicle even half as good as the best that Arnold has done, but ""The Rundown"" has its moments.",The Rundown
20,bowmanblue,Arnie would have loved this,8,27 October 2014,"And by all accounts he did. Welcome to the Jungle would have been a perfect vehicle for Schwarzenegger (if he was a little younger maybe), as it has all the ingredients of an 'old school' Arnie action film. Yes, there are plenty of beatings and shoot-outs, but they're all pretty tongue-in-cheek and precede a witty quip or a dodgy pun.The Rock (or Dwayne Johnson if we're being technical) plays a bounty hunter, employed to bring Stiffler back from the jungle. Sean William Scott seems to be stuck in his 'Stiffler' mode from American Pie, but it's no bad thing. He provides most of the bigger laughs next to his long-suffering captor, Dwayne Johnson.Plus the bad guys are exceptionally wicked and deserve everything they get. And there's a seemingly infinite supply of them, just waiting to be beaten or shot to death by Johnson.Expect cheesy action and explosions and our heroes never to sustain so much as a bruise, despite being hurled through the air, landing down cliffs and in trees.And pay attention for Arnie's 'handover' cameo in the opening few seconds.",The Rundown
21,cricketbat,A surprisingly good mix of action and comedy,7,11 May 2021,"I liked The Rundown a lot back when I first saw it. Years down the road, it's still entertaining, even if it's not the knee-slapping, rip-roaring good time it used to be. The pairing of The Rock and Seann William Scott is a surprisingly good mix for comedy, but the story is a little undercooked and the action is fairly choppy. I still enjoy it, though I may not recommend it as highly as I used to.",The Rundown
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,Surprisingly Good,8,29 May 2004,"And very funny.I can honestly say I seriously doubted I would like this film and I only went to see it because it was on and I was there. I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good. In fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.Seann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies. The Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?I look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.Keep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.",The Rundown

26,Movie Nuttball,The Rundown!,7,1 May 2004,"The Rundown is fair film. The acting is very good by the Rock! His character is very convincing! The action is very good and in fact there was some really incredible scenes such as when the Rock used two shot guns at the same time! Seann William Scott was also good and Christopher Walken was as good always. Yes its true that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sven-Ole Thorsen have very brief parts in the movie. The scene with Arnold was extremely short but you could see the size of him next the Rock which they are nearly the identical stature. Peter Berg did a good job directing the film and Harry Gregson-Williams composed the score good. I think The Rock is a fine actor but in My opinion for him to be a real action hero and icon like Arnold was/is when he made classics such as Commando, The Running Man, and Predator he has to take on a more serious role and more violent film but this is just My opinion. If you want to see The Rock in a modern day action flick with Christopher Walken and special cameos by Arnold and Thorsen then watch The Rundown!",The Rundown
27,Floated2,Very entertaining film filled with comedy and action,8,9 September 2010,"The rundown stars The Rock as Beck, a retrieval specialist, which means when someone doesn't pay up, Beck persuades him by offering two options. A, pay up and B, pay up after Beck roughs you up. He'd rather be running his own restaurant, hence the notebook full of recipes. Alas, a large debt to the wrong person keeps him in the persuasion business until he's offered a way out. The wrong person has a lunkhead son (Scott) prowling around the jungles of Brazil. All Beck has to do is bring him back, the debt is settled and he'll even through in a restaurant.When it comes to the action sequences, director Peter Berg moves things along with blazing quick cuts and intense close-ups that rattle bones and get the adrenalin pumping as Beck and Scott face everything from Tarzan ju jitsu with Eddie Reyes, who sets The Rock flying like a big beefy whirligig, to a pack of scrappy monkeys with really, really bad attitudes, not to mention a grudge. But Berg also knows when to slow down and let The Rock and Scott play off each other, the former with a slow burn, the latter with a geekiness that is as pathetic as it is plucky. The Rock and Scott definitely have great chemistry in this, along with Rosario Dawson and Christohper Walker. This is a great film from start to finish and its very entertaining and has some comedy, also great action sequences and decent dialogue. This film has a little bit of Indiana Jones, The Magnificent Seven, and Bad boys.",The Rundown

Oh yes, Arnold even plays a short cameo role!Most of these Dwayne Johnson muscle action movies I cant stand to watch. They bore me within minutes. I stopped watching them. However I accidentally bumped into this one and miraculously I really enjoyed it a lot!Being a grownup I expect some good and witty dialogues and some believablility of the story and the characters. Unfortunately 90% of those action blockbusters are made for kids, who just wanna see explosions and more explosions. This action movie fortunately can be enjoyed by adults as well. Why? Because it has sound jokes and incredibly witty dialogues that stay fresh even after a second or third viewing. I've already seen it four times now and I enjoyed the jokes as much as during the first viewing.Furthermore violence is funny and cartoonlike and has got a gentleman quality to it, without any gruesome violence. (Suited for kids). I love that. This movie truly excells beyond the regular popcorn action blockbusters.

The results: The Rundown! Playing a bounty hunter is definitely a good role for The Rock. He doesn't play around, and I think he should thank Martha Stewart for the cooking ideas. Better yet, it should the ""E"" man; Emeril Lagasse. For the voice he lends to the The Rock's character. I liked all the scenes in the movie, and even though they were pretty fast paced, the fun factor was never lost. Take the jungle scene, where all the rebels fight Beck, there was a lot of action there. And I think the humor was the backup factor there too. Rosario Dawson provided a lot of quality as well. I liked the part where she gave Beck(The Rock) and Travis(Seann William Scott) some of that funky fruit. And then they had to wake up with the monkeys, with what Beck had to put up with earlier in the movie. Christopher Walken was good playing the bad ""a"". It was funny, when he had the .44 automatic shot out of his hand, and had to choose Option A, the hard way. This movie had a lot to give, action, adventure, and comedy. What more do you want?

The storyline for this is very unique and fun for an action film; and as you can tell by the cast names, the acting is way better than most action flicks. The script is absolutely marvelous and hilarious from beginning to end. The action scenes are over the top good with outstanding choreography and camera angles.

32,alindsay-al,A poor action film that luckily didn't stop the rock,3,16 September 2015,"I am a big fan of the rock and this is one of his early films so I thought I'd watch it, but unfortunately it sucks. The premise of the film sees a bounty hunter looking to retire but he must go to the Amazon to retrieve his bosses son. Now as I said I like the rock and he really tries in this film to bring his likability and charm to his character but he just can't fully deliver. His character is just pretty boring and there's no attachment to his character at all and he is just pretty boring. Seann William Scott plays the son and I absolutely hated him in this film. He tried to be funny and he just came across as really annoying in this film. I didn't buy him and the rock together and his character just didn't develop at all and I hated him. I love Rosario Dawson especially after daredevil, but she didn't really add anything to this film. She was okay, but her character was pretty bland and pointless. Christopher walken plays the villain in this film and he was actually pretty good even though he sometimes gets incredibly cheesy. The story just makes absolutely no sense and none of the characters come across as very likable and you don't care about the situation at all. The script was awful with no funny dialogue and no reasons for any good dramatic dialogue. The style was a bit unique and I liked the setting of the film. But the action scenes were just really hard to see what was going on even though there were some decent sound effects. Overall this is a poor action film that you can avoid.",The Rundown
33,NateWatchesCoolMovies,One of the best action movies ever,10,12 May 2016,"Ahh, Peter Berg's The Rundown. What a sun soaked galavant of action fun, a purely cinematic exercise in excitement and joyous fun, a rollicking genre exercise that's free from the burdens of intellectual expectation. No, it's nothing but playtime here, and one of the rare cases where a PG-13 rating actually doesn't hurt an action film. It's so lighthearted and affable that the extra bloody punch of an R rating probably would have been a jarring, unnecessary distraction and offset it's tone. For the record, you will almost never hear me advocate that in this genre, but I suppose every issue has its extreme exceptions. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays Beck, a rough and tumble dude who coyly disguises the title of bounty hunter by calling himself a 'retrieval expert'. He's essentially a big teddy bear with the ability to rip out your stuffing and kick the ever loving crap out of anyone whose demise will earn him a pay cheque. He doesn't like using guns, and every cent he makes goes towards a dream of opening up his own restaurant. Pretty much the most adorable action hero you can imagine. He is sent by a Miami crime lord (William Lucking hamming it up royally) to retrieve his wayward son (Sean William Scott) who has run off to an unspecified tropical country. Beck jumps a plane and runs off to said country to give us one of the most pleasantly riotous action/comedy/adventure of the 00's. His pursuit of Scott leads him to endless picturesque jungles, horny baboons, invincible native Kung fu warriors and more. Scott turns out to be an elusive wise - ass who is nothing but calamity for both Beck and himself. The scenes where they try the dodgy local fruit are rewind worthy. He really shines here, bringing the same burn-down-the-house attitude he did as Stiffler. There's also a priceless artifact that everyone is trying to retrieve, including a tough local bartender (Rosario Dawson). There's also a villain, as there must be in any action film, a bugnuts local tyrant named Hatcher played by the one and only Christopher Walken. Hatcher is a wonderful Walken creation whose attempted menace is constantly undone by his penchent for silliness, a winning combination that super-charges every scene he gets. That lanky Scotsman Ewan Bremer is wicked funny as a deranged bush pilot who assists Beck in unintelligible endearance. Hearing him vivaciously recite Dylan Thomas's 'Dying Of The Light' right before a big old gunfight kicks off is absolute gold. Dwayne makes nice work of the action hero archetype, bringing an almost adolescent buoyancy to his vibe that he may even have not seen coming when he got into the craft. There's a surprise cameo from a genre titan early on in the film that is essentially a passing of the torch symbol, so eyes should be kept peeled. Director Berg knows how to wow an audience in many a genre, this being my favourite excursion of his thus far. It's loud, scenic, unapologetic and has fun six ways to freaking Sunday.",The Rundown

35,Enchorde,Disappointing jungle adventure,4,4 September 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **Beck (The Rock) is running errands for a LA-mobster. His latest assignment, and his last before being set free, is to bring home the mobsters son Travis (Scott) who is hunting treasures in the deep Amazon jungle. Now Beck is a pretty competent bounty hunter, however now he become mixed up with Travis treasure-hunt, corrupted and cruel local boss Hatcher (Walken) and local rebels. Not to mention there is a jungle out there...Now, before watching this I expected this to be an entertaining action movie with some explosions, choreographed hand to hand fights, some jokes and one-liners. I was disappointed. In one word one could sum up the movie to: Silly. The jokes were silly. Often with some adolescent humor or without any point. According to trivia the ""lightning and thunder""-acts were improvised at first but kept in the movie because they were so funny. To whom? I just found them dull, stupid and silly. The fights were choreographed enough. Choreographed and defying gravity to the point you could ""see"" were the lines were attached to the actors that kept pretending to be superman and flew around. Predictable too, at first of course Beck took a beating few would survive but after getting mad enough just stood up and beat the crap out of everyone.So, no suspense, just a few funny jokes, no good fights and actors that can do so much better. That counts for all of them but especially for Walken. However I believe that the major fault is that with the material at hand, no-one could have done better. And who got the brilliant idea to have Beck and Travis attacked by monkeys (baboons I believe) from Africa in the middle of the South-American jungle? And not to mention the free(?) commercial that XFL got...There were only one memorable point from the entire movie, and that was Schwarzeneggers cameo, and that lasted for a couple of seconds at most. No, this was not good. The idea was nice, but please try again and do it better...4/10",The Rundown

It also has some of the best stunt work as two stunt men are thrown from a jeep as it falls off the side of a cliff. The stunt men tumble and fall down the cliff, hitting multiple trees and debris. Eventually the two men perform a tumbling 55' high fall into a large pool without the use of wires.But, what it has most of all is the Puerto Rican, Cuban, African American, Irish and Native American beauty Rosario Dawson (Rent, Sin City, Grindhouse).This is probably the best role I have seen for Christopher Walken.

38,eric262003,The Rock Knows His Role Here,9,21 August 2016,"In the year 2000, charismatic WWE superstar Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson made his acting debut in ""The Mummy Returns"", the viewers thought ""here we go again"", another wrestling superstar making a fool of himself by starring in another convoluted action film! It's been done!"" We all hoped he would just simply put on the trunks and just grapple with Steve Austin or Triple H and headline another pay- per-view. But he didn't let the critics get the best of him. He took himself to other avenues in the entertainment community where his talents were appreciated. He was a guest on the long-running sketch comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"" where he excelled quite nicely as a comedic performer and did well as satirization to near perfection. Then in 2002, he returned to the big screen for another tryout. He reprised his role in ""The Mummy Returns"" spin-off ""The Scorpion King"" and though not entirely The Rock's fault the script and the movie as a whole was a flop, and once again he was the centre of ridicule as another no- talent wrestler/actor wannabe. But his guest performances on SNL proved contrary if given the right scripting for him to work on. In 2003, The Rock stars in ""The Rundown"" which combines adventure mixed in with spectacular comedic elements to it. In many ways it feels like a satirical take on the Indiana Jones films of the 1980's set in the Amazon jungles of Brazil. The Rock seems to be closer at home here as he juxtaposes his knack for comedic smarminess and his ability to excite us with the action scenes splendidly. ""The Rundown"" turned this wannabe actor into the real deal. The Rock stars as Beck, a bounty hunter who's been assigned to scour the Brazilian jungles to a mining village of El Dorado to rescue the son who's father is the leader of an organized crime establishment. The spoiled stubborn son goes by the name Travis (Seann William Scott) who at the time was the right person to play spoiled whiny twenty-somethings. The head honcho is a guy named Hatcher (Christopher Walken) who has successfully gain access to his worker's lives by charging them a bundle in cost of living expenses as well as blackmailing them every chance he gets and is not afraid to utilize strong-arm tactics. Travis can't escape where he is, but also really has no intentions for that matter. He believes there's a treasure nearby with loot that's gregariously sufficient in profit. Hatcher wants his end of the deal too which is why he refrains from shooting Beck and Travis when Beck lures him away through trial and tribulation. This leads to a high octane chase as Beck tries to lure Travis out of the Amazonian jungles with Hatcher's troop not far behind them. To make things more complex than we have thought, there are few people who oppose Hatcher and his intentions. Beck and Travis are befriended by a local villager named Mariana who also has intentions of obtaining the treasure as a means to free her villagers from Hatcher's clutches. I guess we needed a human rights diatribe implanted in this action flick, but I couldn't care the least. The film was directed by Peter Berg with a script by written by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is extremely entertaining and vibrant. The verbal jabs between The Rock and Scott are humorous and clever and the fight scenes exhibits just how tough The Rock is as he fends off against his adversaries with ease is high in adrenaline that will approve to action movie aficionados. And what can be said about screen veteran Christopher Walken? This man doesn't care what film he's in whether good or bad? Heck, this guy will even perform in a movie gratis if he wanted to. As long as there's some eccentricity implanted into his deadpan delivery. His resume during this period sees him starring in very forgettable films that is inferior to his impressive career of films that he has starred in. But ""The Rundown"" may not be an Oscar calibre film like ""The Deer Hunter"", but it's still a great film and Walken plays a very prominent role here and if Walken generates more screen time the more entertained I am. His delivery of lines is very poetic almost like as if he knew the script before reading or maybe he's just a naturally eccentric individual. What's refreshing here is that our protagonist refuses to bear any arms due to a horrific experience with them. Besides knowing his size and strength, why does he need them? But once the movie becomes gun dependent, the timing was well planned. Too many movies feature gratuitous gun fight and it becomes monotonous and mundane. But the gun fights are minimal and only when needed is original. This movie is one that truly unsuspecting pleasant surprise. For those who love action, clever dialogue and plenty of Walken, this movie is highly recommended for all to enjoy.",The Rundown
39,Matt_Layden,A Fun Film Showcasing The Rock's Talents,7,7 June 2010,"Loosely based on Midnight Run, Beck is sent to retrieve Travis from the Amazon. One last job before he can quite and open up his restaurant. Along the way things don't go according to plan and the two of them have to fight for their lives.After his brief cameo in The Mummy Returns and the lead role in the forgettable The Scorpion King, it seemed that The Rundown would be his first true chance at taking over the action franchise from the likes of Arnold, who coincidentally has a cameo in this film. The Rundown does just that, shows The Rock in a lighthearted, action oriented funny film that showcases his talent as an actor. He's not another Hulk Hogan making movies because he can, but he actually has some talent. The guy is fun to watch on the screen and his film career since then has proved so.The Rock get physical in this film, all the fights scenes are stylized to the point of exaggeration. This doesn't detract from the film, it sets up the viewer for the way the film will play out. The fight scene that uses this stylized violence the most is when The Rock takes on the rebels and Keno from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Can a simple kick really throw him in the air like that, just to be kicked again mid air? I don't think so. If you can get pass this style of action, then the Rundown will be entertaining. Sean William Scott manages to break out of his Stifler role, something he tried to do earlier with Bulletproof Monk. Here he has a better co-star to play his comedy off of. Since then he seems to have been hit or miss with his films and continues to star in films with The Rock. Here, Scott isn't irritating, so that is a plus, with the exception of one scene in which he reuses his Evolution joke of making a bird call.Rosario Dawson and Christohper Walken are the supporting players, both plays their roles with no real memorable parts. Rosario Dawson is almost completely forgettable in a role that is underwritten and Walken just seems to be doing his own thing, which he always does in films. We let him get away with it because his Christopher Freakin Walken. Peter Berg did well with this one, he manages to balance both comedy and action very well and the sequences are entertaining to watch. It helps that he has two stars that played well off each other and could pull off the physical stunts required from the roles. The Rundown isn't something to jump up and down about or rush out to see either. It's a film that you can sit down and watch randomly one day and not be upset about it afterwards.",The Rundown

Yes, this was ARNOLD'S way of saying ""The Rock is here to replace ME as the action star"".The movie was ok.  It was like Romancing The Stone getting married to Indiana Jones and giving Birth to THE RUNDOWN.  Sprinkle in a little STIFFLER and AIRBRUSHED FIGHT SCENES, and you have this movie.The scene where they ""take a fall"" was impossible.  First of all, that fall would KILL anybody.  Second of all, if it didn't kill, there is NO way that they could just continue walkiing TO THE AIRSTRIP!!That fruit that they ate was not a real fruit.  Fruits do NOT make you feel that way.  The PUFF FISH from Japan is the only food that can make you seem paralyzed.   That's why it's so popular in the ZOMBIE countries of HATE-EE and DOMINICAN REPUBLIC!!!The remainder of the movie was good.  Even that lampshade that Walked called a HAT worked.  Only WALKEN could deliver the goods as he always does when he is the villian.  Oh yes, he played a very EVIL man who reminded me of the bad guy in SHANGHI NOON with Jackie Chan.  He was slaveowner who paid his slaves 65 cents an hour.As for the fighter monkey, he was great.  I loved it how he chanted FLOATS LIKE BUTTERFLY,,,STINGS LIKE BEE!!!There was a very obvious RIP OFF of RAMBO.

44,Spuzzlightyear,"Rundown, you better take care..",7,9 July 2005,"Rundown is the type of movie that, if you leave your brain at the door, you could possibly enjoy. The Rock plays a bounty hunter hired to bring back the son of a wealthy Mafioso-type of guy. The Rock has sworn off these types of missions, but is convinced to do, that's right the One Last Job to help get the restaurant he's always wanted.He goes to South America, where the son, played by Seann William Scott is in looking for a Latin American Idol of some sort. This idol is also sought out by the so called owner of the town, a lecherous slimy sort of character usually played by Christopher Walken (in a casting coup. Christopher Walken plays this role). The idol also is coveted by a female bartender in town, who just happens to be the rebel leader fighting the dictatorship Walken has over the town.Anyways, none of these people particularly like each other, and since it's a adventure / action movie, the fights become actiony / adventurey. The fights and the stunt sequences are all very well done, but soon one tires of the whole cartoonish aspects of the plot, and soon the whole thing bogs down into a ""waiting for the next action sequence to happen"" sort of thing. It's actually quite funny how one person gets possession of the idol, only to lose it to someone 5 mins later, then another person 5 mins later, and so on. At least Seann William Scott and The Rock have some fun comradeship together. I understand they're making another movie together, let's hope it's better than this one.",The Rundown

The Rock was okay, but everyone else was poor in the acting field.  Even Walken, whom I really like, seemed out of place.  Like he didn't know what he was doing there.And this absurd take on bullet time is a complete joke.  Sure I guess we are supposed to find it funny, but I thought it was stupid.

46,TheUnknown837-1,"One hundred and four minutes of sheer, visceral enjoyment is what one looks for and finds in ""The Rundown""",9,3 October 2010,"One of the ideal popcorn movies of recent years has been Peter Berg's ""The Rundown"" a highly humorous 2003 action-adventure flick starring Dwayne Johnson (back when he was billed as The Rock) and Seann William Scott. There is a key moment early in the picture when Johnson is walking into a rough n tough party room and passes Gov. Schwarzenegger on the way out. The governor, once the hot muscle-man in movies, turns to Johnson and comments: ""Have fun."" He passes down the torch to the next generation and in just the right movie. Since ""The Rundown"" and other early successes of his', he has become a movie icon and deservedly so. He just had to showcase his genuine talents in a great movie. And ""The Rundown"" is a great movie. It is 104 minutes of pure enjoyment, something we don't find so easily these days.What's even more remarkable about the film is that it accomplishes this without breaking any new ground. It is an old-fashioned adventure tale just brought to life with a modern style. Other films have attempted this and failed. So why does ""The Rundown"" succeed? Let's take a look and find out.The movie stars Johnson as Mr. Beck, a mob boss's collector who is afraid to go against an NFL offensive line because he doesn't want to hurt them and ruin their chances of winning another championship. Wanting to leave and start his own business (a restaurant) he gets the final assignment of tracking down his boss's renegade son (Seann William Scott) who is residing in Brazil. When Johnson gets there, he not only has trouble restraining the rebellious and persistent Scott, but also faces opposition from a cruel land-owner played by Christopher Walken and freedom-fighters led by Rosario Dawson, all of whom want to get their hands on a priceless artifact hidden in the jungle.Nothing new in terms of plot. And not much else new in terms of story. I think a key element that makes ""The Rundown"" a winner is because of its ideal casting. Sure, anybody from Sly Stallone to Gov. Schwarzenegger or even a new face could have been cast as Mr. Beck, but Johnson not only has the buff and cynical looks, but an enormous amount of on-screen charisma that we seem to be lacking in a lot of movie stars these days. Johnson not only fits the role, but he plays it extremely well. He's tough, but funny at the same time. The jokes are well-written, but he plays the notes just right. Seann William Scott is also ideally cast in his role. In the hands of a lesser actor, or somebody else, the smart-lipped character might have come across as being nothing but irritation. Scott plays the role like an early Jim Carrey role. Sort of like Ace Ventura if he were a treasure hunter. But he neither overplays nor underplays this role. He finds just the right note in between and produces a very funny and likable guy even if those around cannot agree with us. Christopher Walken has a cut-out villain to play, but he does so with such scene-stealing power that he makes a rather memorable character out of his standardized dialogue and motives. And Rosario Dawson is very well suited for her role. She is beautiful, but not smoking hot so that does not distract us. She also plays the role of a freedom fighter with conviction.Another key element to the success of ""The Rundown"" is how it chooses to mix both action and humor. But it never overplays one or underplays the other. The action is neither too intense nor too lackluster. By contrast, it is very imaginative such as when Johnson fights off a group of men with guns pointed at him using nothing more than the furniture around him. Like Jackie Chan with muscles. There's also great humorous touches such as Mr. Beck's option A or option B speeches. See the movie to learn what I'm mentioning her. And sometimes they blend seamlessly, such as a highlight moment which could be called the ""roll down."" Again, I don't want to ruin it for you, so see the movie.Peter Berg controls every scene in ""The Rundown"" and makes sure that it never slides out of the goodhearted, old-fashioned tradition of the movies it wants to follow. He knows how to use a camera and does things that the makers of the movies that inspired him could not do because of the technical limitations of their time. The film is continuing a well-respected tradition that unfortunately seems to have slipped out of public interest. That may be why ""The Rundown"" became a real success financially after its theatrical run. It's refreshing to know that somebody's trying. Maintaining what worked before, but doing it with a fresh style. This is sheer visceral fun from a competent cast and director. ""The Rundown"" is a modern-day American cult classic.",The Rundown
47,fmarkland32,Rock the boat...,7,25 February 2007,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson stars as a bounty hunter who is hired to retrieve the son (Seann William Scott) of a local mobster in the amazon, while there he ends up hunting for treasure and fighting local oppressive mercenaries looking for said treasure. The Rundown is far more enjoyable than what you'd expect, The Rock exudes more charisma than Vin Diesel and overall the movie is an enjoyable time waster, although Seann William Scott is very irritating and therefore he grinds down some of the fun to be had. I must admit i'm no fan of Seann William Scott (Aside from the American Pie films) he always has such an irritating presence that he's always a liability to any good movie he's in. However far better is The Rock who's charisma makes up for Scott, as well as provides an excellent tough guy presence that is sorely lacking in today's action movies. The fight sequences are very well staged (Especially the fight sequence between Ernie Reyes Jr and The Rock) and overall this is the definition of guilty pleasure action that recalls the days of the 80's actioner. Not to mention Christopher Walken who is always welcome no matter how ridiculous the role. Last but not least The Rundown measures as the second best movie (Second to They Live) to ever star a wrestler.* * * out of 4-(Good)",The Rundown

Between the action there's really nothing much to see here besides a borderline extended cameo from Christopher Walken (plus a blink and you'll miss it Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo), and some mild amusements involving baboons. But the action itself is break-neck, varied and plentiful, and some of the stunts do look painfully real despite the fact that they appear to hardly even slow the characters down.

49,jon.h.ochiai,The People's Movie Star,8,30 September 2003,"""The Rundown"" starring WWE's The Rock is first rate entertainment. Directed by Peter Berg, and written by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt, ""The Rundown"" is crisp action, funny, witty, and absolutely enjoyable. The Rock emerges as the next Big Thing in action movies. Really he distinguishes himself as a movie star. Supported by Sean William Scott (""American Pie"" and ""Bullet Proof Monk""), Rosario Dawnson (""Men in Black II""), and Christopher Walken as the ever whacked villain, Hatcher, The Rock truly lays the Smack Down.The story has The Rock as bounty hunter, Beck, who has one last job to complete so that he can retire and open a restaurant. However, this involves bringing back his boss's son Travis (Scott) who is somewhere in the jungles of Brazil. More precisely he is in a gold mining town owned by the evil robber baron Hatcher (Walken). While they're in the Amazon, Beck enrolls the aid of a local bar keep, Mariana (Dawson). She also happens to be the leader of a band of jungle rebels. Travis knows the whereabouts of a sacred and priceless object, El Gato, which makes him a target of both Mariana and Hatcher. Sounds complicated? Not really. It's just an exercise, so our reluctant hero, Beck, can kick some serious butt. Apparently, Beck does not like to use guns, because ""bad things usually happen...""The Rock has all the tools of an Action Star. He is a very good looking man, is a physical presence, a trained athlete, has an awesome physique, and has a sense of humor. He is charming, charismatic, and intentionally funny. He also has great intensity. He is a good actor. He is very natural and comfortable on screen. Sean William Scott is the perfect foil for him. Scott is funny, a smart ass, and has his own physical presence. Rosario Dawson is wonderful as the beautiful and mysterious rebel leader. Dawson shines with both strength and intelligence. Walken is perfect as the ruthless and skewed Hatcher. Director Peter Berg orchestrates the party skillfully. His inventive camera angles and profile inserts, give the film a high-tech edge. It's also great to see The Rock use some of his pro-wrestling prowess in the fight scenes. This is so refreshing, given that most movie fight choreography you see nowadays are re-engineered versions of ""The Matrix"".The lowdown on ""The Rundown"" is that The Rock is now the People's Movie Star. And he has to give props to his Crew.",The Rundown
50,carbuff,This is what popcorn was invented for.,8,11 May 2015,"Get the popcorn. It's quite watchable, except for Chistopher Walken who has been phoning it in for as long as I can remember now. Not great art for sure, but some cool machinery, some well-choreographed action sequences, some good laughs, and a workable plot. This film also plays perfectly to the talents of both Seann William Scott and ""The Rock"", which is what really keeps it right-side up. It's been said that casting is the most important decision in making a movie, and this film looks like good evidence.The ending seems quite problematical to me, but up to that point, it all flows very well. This film begs for a sequel to elaborate on how ""The Rock's"" character works his way out of the difficult situation that he has certainly left himself in. Maybe one was intended and that is why it finished in this seemingly incomplete fashion.",The Rundown
51,TheNorthernMonkee,garbage,1,27 November 2004,"SPOILERSEver since breaking into cinema, Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, has appeared in films with the intention of being the new action hero. With a mediocre back catalogue, this awful film is perhaps the worst of the lot.As debt collector Beck, The Rock is dispatched to Brazil with the intention of returning Seann William Scott's treasure hunting Travis to his father. Upon encountering Travis however, he finds himself fighting for a peoples revolution and freedom from the tyranny of the evil Hatcher (Christopher Walken).As the debt collector who slowly experiences a moral revolution, The Rock is not particularly awful. As is Scott as the life enjoying Travis. As a duo in fact, the two work rather well. The problem though is that the film's script is just abysmal.Written by a former ""Xena"" writer, the general plot and script of this film are tedious and unappealing. Presented as both a comedy and an action film, this story satisfies neither category. The story in fact is a joke, and appeals to no-one. From the moment the Rock first appears, we find ourselves questioning the motivation to watch this film. The plot is weak, the scripting is hideous, and the action scenes are just generally awful.The worst thing about the action sequences is mainly how badly they are presented. Attempting to combine the Rock's skills with an Indiana Jones sense of intensity, the film fails to really achieve either. In fact by attempting to do so much, this film simply manages to destroy everything it might wish to achieve.All in all, there's little praise which can be made for this film. It might deserve credit for trying, but with such a shocking final feature, it's impossible to have any praise. All in all, for whatever it attempted to do, this film simply should never have been made. It's a hideous waste of time and money. Avoid at all costs.",The Rundown
52,CANpatbuck3664,One of My Favourite Turn Your Brain Off Action Movies,9,18 November 2016,"Everybody has a few of those movies that they like and go back to even when nobody understands what you like so much about it. I don't think this movie is beyond defending, there's a reason that even today they talk about a sequel. But if you made me stand up in front of a room full of critics and asked me what makes the Rundown such a good action/adventure movie, the argument might be tough to verbalize. I think what makes this movie memorable are the super fun to watch action scenes, the great comedic chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott and it captures the swashbuckling experience taking advantage of the atmosphere.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Beck (Dwayne Johnson) is a recovery expert who handles the tough jobs. You send him when you expect the mark to fight or run before they give up what's due. At the beginning of the movie, he steps into a nightclub to get back some money owed to his boss from a star college QB who loves to gamble. Even though he's with some of some other college football stars, his boss Walker (William Lucking) orders him to take his championship ring as collateral until he can pay back the loan. Beck tries to do it peacefully but ends up fighting with 6 different football players. He's able to get the ring but is ambushed by a competing bounty hunter and loses it.He gets back to Walker who laughs at his misfortune. Beck doesn't want to do this anymore and isn't taking jobs because he enjoys the work. He's indebted to Walker and is trying to work off his debt. Beck tries to walk out but Walker barks at him to get back in line. One last job awaits him, Walker gives him the assignment of tracking down his estranged son Travis (Sean William Scott). He's a university dropout hanging out in Brazil, he fancies himself an archaeologist and is trying to recover a native treasure named The Gato. Beck hops on a plane and heads out for Brazil to track down Travis and get him out of town without getting into trouble with local gang lord Hatcher (Christopher Walken).The plot of the Rundown is a bit of a throwback and isn't completely new. But while this movie isn't actually filmed in Brazil, the jungle that the characters run through almost feels like a character in the movie. There's a great scene where they fall off a cliff and when they hit trees or the rocks, the hits are bone jarring. People swing from vines during the fights and even though its a bit childish, there's a pretty good gag with some horny monkeys. It reminds me a little of Indiana Jones where the location plays into the action and it feels organic. It's a nice touch and it adds to the movie.The plot may be familiar but what helps you get into this movie is that the 2 main characters work so well together. This movie was one of the first really good movies that Dwayne was in and while Sean's character is close but not exactly Stifler from the American Pie movies, they sell it. Their dialogue is sharp but Dwayne's intensity and Sean's goofy style play off each other well. Rosario Dawson is an underrated actress and she's pretty good here. She always seems to be in the background but she doesn't get her due, I hope she does one day. Christopher Walken chews the scenery in the best possible way. He's so over-the-top that he's hilarious and it also fits the tone of the movie.Someone who is ready to judge this movie is going to point out so many things that are impossible to do from a physics perspective or from a logical point of view. Normally I would get that argument but I think when Peter Berg stays away from drama like Lone Survivor or Deepwater Horizon, he's one of the better directors at making the action fun to watch. He's a better director than he's given credit for (he also made my favourite football movie Friday Night Lights). There's a great fight out in the jungle between Dwayne and some of the rebels that is just a blast to watch even though it isn't realistic at all. The ending action set piece is explosive in an exploitative way and I mentioned that fall down the cliff is wince inducing. This movie wouldn't have worked if the movie didn't have the fun spirit it has but it does.I would really like to get this sequel Berg and The Rock keep talking about. Beck isn't a terribly deep character but he would be fun to watch in a franchise. This movie isn't realistic but it always puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott make a good comedic duo and the action scenes aren't groundbreaking but they're unique enough to enjoy. This movie isn't new but its worth revisiting and if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, its an underrated find.",The Rundown

54,MichaelMargetis,A Good Action Film -- The Rock does an O.K. job,6,29 April 2005,"I felt this movie wasn't as good as a lot of the critics were making it out to be. When I saw it I was actually expecting a cool, fun and hilarious thrill ride of a movie. I got a fun, funny at parts, buddy-action movie. The acting was kind of mediocre (as expected). Probably the best performance in the whole movie was Christopher Walken. He was actually very funny as the nasty, goof crime lord, Hatcher. The Rock was actually pretty good but I don't think he has as much charisma as Arnold Schwarzenegger had ten years ago. Actually Govenor ""Ahnuld"" Schwarzenegger has a cameo in the beginning of the movie. Seann William Scott didn't really impress me and Rosario Dawson was average at best. The film contains some pretty exciting action and fight sequences, but the premise didn't really grab me (very seldomly mindless action/adventure films do). The movie is about a bulky bounty hunter who doesn't believe in guns, Beck (The Rock), who is hired by his boss to retrieve his boss' son, Travis (Scott) who has run away to the Amazon Jungle to escape an angry mob boss back in L.A. whose wife he's slept with. When Travis is down there he meets a young bartender Brazilian woman, Mariana, (Dawson) who with her tries to find an ancient gold cobra artifact. When Beck gets there and gets ready to take Travis back to L.A., a local crime kingpin Hatcher (Walken) won't let him due to money owed. So Beck, Travis and Mariana make a run for it, with Hatcher chasing them. This is an OK movie to make a trip to the theaters for if you've already seen all the better movies out there beforehand. I weakly recommend it, so go at your own risk. If you decide not to go, be sure to rent it on DVD because it makes for a definite good rental.

Answer: Watch 'The Rundown' before answering...,4,10 October 2009,"Again, I beg to differ with most of the critics, this time because I find the movie much worse than they do. I honestly do not understand what they saw in 'The Rundown'...What I saw was a very mediocre film, based almost solely on innumerable ridiculous and unnecessary fight sequences, totally over the top, unrealistic and sometimes downright silly. In addition, the plot is so thin you can see right through it from the very beginning. It goes without saying that the same can be said about the dialog, the acting and strangely enough even the cinematography is not what it could have been given the surroundings.Not even Christopher Walken with another one of his classical 'bad guy' performances (which have gotten to be a little too much of a stereotype in my opinion) manages to save the day.

Johnson has charisma as an actor and just keeps getting better. The action scenes are fantastic and it's hard to pick out a favorite one. Seann Scott is positively hilarious as the wisecracking little target of Dwayne's hunt. Their back and forth reminds me of Crash and Eddie from Ice Age 2 fearlessly taking on Diego. Rosario Dawson is as sexy as ever as the bartender and what can I say about Christopher Walken? He's his usual self delivering a quirky role yet again. If you love funny action/comedy, this is a keeper.",The Rundown
59,supertom-3,The Tom says: Good old fashioned rollicking action!,8,27 July 2004,"With the demise of box office power for the action man and a loss of interest from the public to watch the bad-ass hero, who says little but kicks a lot of butt, the kings of the genre Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly Stallone and Willis's careers as action men seems all but over. Van Damme and Seagal were gone long ago. Should the main three want to do mainly action movies for the rest of the careers then they may need to do so in the DTV market. However, it does seem like the action movie could be getting a second wind. We have a plethora of new action heroes, none of whom will have the staying power of Schwarzenegger and also respected actors who play everyday men like Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Nic Cage and Will Smith have turned in their fair share of action movies. The Rock does seem the ideal new action man, with his only real competition from wooden pretty boy Paul Walker and the now seemingly cursed to do crap movies, Vin Diesel (who in truth would be best as a baddie, like in Pitch Black.). The Rundown, while a box office disappointment has performed well on video but more importantly audiences really enjoyed it's delightfully 80's feel. It could almost be taken from Sly or Arnolds early career. It's not loaded with a hip new soundtrack, extreme sports or slick vehicles and loads of special effects merely to lure youngsters in to see it. It's modernised and stylised version of films like Commando (albeit much better than that.). The simplistic, one-liner laden films I used to love. Throughout the mid to late 90's as audiences got tired of that, and a lot of seeming re-hashes and Sly and co doing movies very similar to ones they had done before, meant that producers tried to give characters to these guys with more depth, without getting someone to write it decently and of course in the case of Schwarzenegger, trying to give a 3 dimensional person to someone who can't act. Now as for Sly and Willis they have wasted a lot of their career doing action movies because it doesn't stretch them as actors. They are good actors given good roles, people forget Stallone got an Oscar nomination. The Rock is more like Arnold. He's limited in his acting chops but has a charm and likeability and a good presence and we can expect no more from him than simple roles, where his prerequisite is simply to cause carnage and emote on the odd occasion. I am glad we could see a reinvention of 80's action movies, Jackie Chan breathed new life ot the martial arts genre throughout the late 90's and the first years of this decade, but they seem to be wearing thin now so it seems some good old fashioned superhuman carnage could be on the cards, there's even the possibility of a new Die Hard, Rambo, True Lies and some new films like Spy Hunter. Even Van Damme and co in DTV land are going back to basics and not trying to test their acting, because truth be told for 99% percent of these action stars it's a test where failure is inevitable and it's not what their fans really want. The Rundown is simplistic stuff. You have a simple premise and a setting that is prepped and ready to be blown up. You have a strange mix of central characters, with The Rock and Sean William Scott. Meaning there will be plenty of fast jive talking and one liners. You have your thespian in their as the bad guy. Christopher Walken in this case and your ready, you have the basis for a good fun action movie. This is great fun. Arnold and Sly would be proud to have this on their CV. In fact it is on Arnies CV because he has a cameo at the start which is effectively him passing the torch on to the Rock. There are no twists and turns of any really note but the important thing is that it is nicely paced it has a nice glossy sheen to the cinematography. There are few hints at them aiming for a particularly young and hip-hop or Nu Metal demographic like Fast And Furious or Jet Li's films have done, thankfully. It's cool without going over the top and blowing it's wad. I like the fact this isn't made for pimply teenagers first and foremost. It's made for action lovers, it's a loving and subtle gift to young adults, 20 something's who watched the action films in the 80's and early 90's when they were undemanding, untainted fun and far form the marketed tripe we get now. The Rock is good here. He has improved so much from The Scorpion King. He has charisma he's got a natural screen presence and a charm. In fact he's more natural than Arnold with his acting, he even has more of a vulnerable side (although not that much). I do think that given time the Rock will be better than his sensei. He has after all only just started. He won't however have as high a standard of movies. Let's not forget Arnold hasn't only done good action films but good films and classic movies with the first 2 Terminators. What the Rock now needs is a box office hit. He hit it big with Scorpion King but since then his movies have not been hits, Walking Tall being a flop. His next, Spy Hunter which sees him team with action maestro John Woo has got fantastic hit potential and potential to be as good as this film. Sean William Scott is also good. He does his Stifler thing again and it's good. It's almost as much to do with how the Rock plays and reacts off him that makes his role funny. Of course Christopher Walken is good and he has a trademark and hilariously intense speech about the tooth fairy that will have you in stitches. Rasario Dawson is also good.The action is great, some of the best this year I have to say. It's old fashioned carnage, not reliant on CGI. It's imaginative stuff and well thought out as well as being well edited. The Rock is a great ass-kicker. He performs most of his own stunts and has real natural ability to put on a show with his fights, thanks largely to his WWE background. Peter Berg handles the set pieces with poise.This is a highly entertaining flick, bringing back pleasant memories and is one of the best action films in years. ****",The Rundown

In fact, I would have been happier if they quickly killed him off.  Note to Seann William Scott: you are out of place in action films, make no more.

63,tburke85,The Rundown A Pretty Good Action Adventure,8,12 June 2009,"The Rundown is a pretty good action adventure with equally impressive performances by Dwayne Johnson and Seann William Scott. Director Peter Berg has done a solid job of making this movie about a mob enforcer who goes to the Amazon to bring back his boss' son but gets into far more than he bargained for while on a search for a legendary treasure. Dwyane Johnson turns in a good performance as Beck an aspiring chef who takes this last job to bring back the son of his boss. Johnson's very believable as the hero especially in the action/fight sequences no matter how over the top some of them get in the movie. Sean William Scott is just as good as the boss' estranged son Travis who's after a legendary treasure thats somewhere in the Amazon forest. Scott bring much comic relief to the movie as he usually does which balances well between the action, drama, and suspense. The rest of the cast are solid in their roles including Rosario Dawson, Christopher Walken, Ewen Bremner, and Jon Gries but they're not given much to do. There's also a blink and you missed it cameo by a certain governor I'm sure everyone has heard about. The action/fight sequences are well executed but some of them get unrealistic at times which isn't necessarily a bad thing it just makes you shake your heard saying, ""yea right I don't care how tough you are"" once and a while but other than that they're still intense and well paced. Overall despite some flaws The Rundown is still an entertaining action adventure comedy thats definitely worth seeing because of the impressive performances by Johnson and Scott.",The Rundown
64,ScottDMenzel,"Just another action, adventure comedy that offers nothing new to the genre",4,23 November 2003,"I must admit I never had much interest in seeing this movie. I however read a lot of good reviews for it and was told by a few friends that it was a decent movie and I should check it out. It came to the local $2 theater this weekend so I figured what the heck, I'll check it out. How bad can it possibly be?Well, the movie stars off good with the Rock (AKA Dwayne Johnson) appearing in the movie right away, but as soon as the title of the film flashes on the screen which is about 10 minutes into the movie it all goes down hill from there. The movie's plot is probably the main problem. Beck (The Rock) is sent on one final mission to go to the Amazon to find his boss's son Travis played by the annoying Sean William Scott. Why is his son in the Amazon? Why does he want to find his son? Why did his son leave? All these questions never get answered. I know this movie was an action adventure comedy and trust me I don't mind those types of movies. But the plot holes are huge. Well besides trying to understand that first plot hole, the movie continues on.Beck goes to the Amazon on a little plane that is held together by Duck Tape (everyone laugh Ha Ha Ha). This is where he meets Hatcher played by the awesome Christopher Walken. Hatcher informs Beck that in order to take Travis back to his father he must pay him ten thousand dollars. Beck pays Hatcher the money and then goes to a bar, which is where he meets Mariana (Rosario Dawson) and tells her that he wants to find Travis. Well Travis of coarse is right in the bar and asks Beck what he wants? He tells him to bring him back to his Father? And from this point on this is where the film gets really bad. Matrix like action scenes, humping monkeys, and way to much of Sean William Scott ensuesFirst the Acting, I don't really know much about the Rock but I liked him in this movie. I think I see him becoming a big actor in the future as long as he chooses better roles because I think his talent is wasted here.  Sean William Scott plays Sean William Scott, which means no more than he plays the same damn role in every movie. Learn to act buddy, stop playing the idiot character all the time. Rosario Dawson is okay here but her fake accent is really bad and it tends to appear and disappear in the film. The most wasted actor in the film is Christopher Walken, who I really like as an actor. His character was so lame and wasted. He probably could have made the movie good if he was given better material to work from.
The Action was dull and boring. I am sick and tired of the Matrix slow motion action scenes. It's so dumb and repetitive. Every film has them now. They need to stop. What happen to the good old fashion violence? Not this kicking and fighting in slow motion. I am tired of it and the film just has so much of it.The plot holes as mentioned above are one of many. The one mentioned above with why his father is trying to find him isn't answered. Another one is with Beck who doesn't use guns? They don't explain that neither. I can go on and on about this. But those two are the big ones and trust me there are a lot more.In conclusion, the movie starts off strong and then goes nowhere. If you think humping Monkeys and Poison Coconuts are funny then watch this film. If you're looking for some good decent action, watch Die Hard. If you want a good action comedy watch Bad Boys 1 or 2 but skip this puppy. It's a waste of good actors (Dwayne Johnson & Christopher Walken) and offers nothing new or remotely interesting to the action adventure comedy genre. My final rating for the Rundown is a 4/10.",The Rundown
65,freaky_dave,A likable movie that will entertain,7,26 August 2006,"The Rock plays Beck. Beck is a retrievable expert for a mob boss who sends him to the Amazon to pick up his son Travis (Sean William Scott) who is in the Amazon searching for a special treasure. Along the way the excitement ensues as the Rock, who was only going down there to bring Travis back to the states, finds himself helping both Travis and Mariana (Rosario Dawson) keep the treasure from Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a man who seems to be in control of everything down in the Amazon and will stop at nothing to get the treasure for himself.The Rock proves to be very likable in his role, and Scott just plays his usual role as a goofy though likable character as well. The action sequences are really good, and the first scene in the night club was a perfect start to the movie. The cameo at the beginning which has Arnold Swarzenegger pass the torch to The Rock was a perfect moment to let us know exactly what kind of film this was going to be.I liked this movie, and it's ashame that The Rock's other movies have not lived up to this one. Does anybody remember the dreadful Doom. I hope not.Director Peter Berg gives us a fun film here. The action is cool and the zany one liners are perfect.

It's more important that The Rock shows some really promising action skills here. If he continues in this style, he'll take over the throne after the king himself, Arnold Schwarzenneger (who has a cool cameo in this movie, by the way). Whether it comes to gunning, fighting, or just flexing, the Rock's the man. In fact, the action scenes in this film are very, very good ones. There are lots of them too, but that was really necessary since the story sucked big time. It was predictable, stupid, and with Christopher Walken as the villain.",The Rundown
68,ilovedolby,The Rock ignites the screen with his charisma and establishes himself as an action star!,8,28 September 2003,"When people go to action films, they want to see something that is funny, exciting and will keep them on the edge of their seat. `The Rundown,' which stars Dwayne Douglas Johnson, or better known as The Rock, not only provides those expected wants from an action flick, but good direction, as well. There are shots in this film that are so well done they leave the audience staring in awe. Throw in Seann William Scott, primarily known as Stiffler from the `American Pie' series, the conventional bad-guy image of Christopher Walken and the beautiful and gifted acting talent of Rosario Dawson and you get an action film that wouldn't even disappoint the most avid hatters of action films. 	The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter who takes care of the dirty work for his boss, be it the collection of unpaid debts or the roughing up people. However, Beck is sick of this kind of work as he has only been doing it to save up enough money to pursue his real passion-being a chef at his own restaurant. Beck lets his boss know that he's finished with him, but Beck isn't allowed to quit yet. He has to perform one more job before he can cut ties to his fat-cat boss-bring home his boss's son who is living in the Amazon searching for an artifact. Beck agrees and quickly heads for the jungles of the Amazon. When he arrives, he finds Travis (Scott), his boss's son who doesn't want to leave since he hasn't discovered the artifact yet. But Beck isn't a person who takes no for an answer. Beck offers Travis a choice, like he does with all his bounties: A, he can leave with Beck without any trouble, or B, Beck can make Travis leave the hard way. Travis chooses C. Beck quickly grabs Travis and tries to leave with him when Travis's boss Hatcher (Walken) shows up. Hatcher, like Travis, is searching for the same artifact. But Hatcher has the whole town slaving under him to find it, as they carve out hills and mountains in search for the artifact that could make them all rich. It becomes a race not only to flee the jungle and clutches of Hatcher, but also to help save the people that Hatcher is exploiting. The direction by Peter Berg (`Very Bad Things') is fantastic. Berg knows how to make the shots flashy be it by the use of lighting or the action that is taking place on the screen. For example, at the beginning of the film, the character Beck gets in a fight at a nightclub with a bunch of other thugs who owe his boss money. This scene is shot well against the flashing strobe lights of the club that give the images an almost slow motion look. Another scene shows Beck fighting Hatcher's goons in a bar with shots of the swings and kicks in what looks to be slow-motion, but it's still fast enough to show every movement of the fighters in the scene. The only thing I can really compare these kinds of visual effects shots to would be the Bullet-Time technique introduced in `The Matrix.' `The Rundown' is what's really going to establish The Rock as an action star in Hollywood. His last film was `The Scorpion King,' a fun escapist prequel to `The Mummy' films. It will be interesting to see where The Rock will go in his next films with his charisma that ignites audiences into liking him, as he established in the wrestling world. ***",The Rundown
69,moviedude1,"Action film with ""budding"" star.",7,27 September 2003,"Dwayne Johnson has been flirting with Hollywood for a few years, now.  And, when he answered the call, the torch was passed to him by one of the biggest stars of action films in the last 20 years.  My local paper had a little piece on his cameo appearance the day it opened.  Anyone who thinks this film is trash just wants to trash the film itself, because it's really not that bad:The star, although really unproven, yet, seems to carry the persona of someone who is VERY sure of himself.  My significant other said when we got out of the theater that his character was, in fact, very believable. Johnson is a man who is not afraid to put a little of himself into his job, as we saw with ""The Scorpion King,"" and he knows what is required of him. The only thing that is hard to tell is how much of it was actually him and how much was computer generated.The quick camera angle changes during some of the action scenes was a nice touch.  It looks like the editing department had a field day with this film.The premise is very believable.  There are people out there who do this sort of thing all the time, but they may not go to some of the extremes this film did, but then we wouldn't have a film of this magnitude.  A film rated 7 out of 10 stars (on an average) can't be all bad.  If you're a fan of action films, go see the movie!  You probably will enjoy yourself.  If you're a wrestling fan, go see the movie, even if it means putting money in Vince McMahon's pocket (he produced it)!",The Rundown

71,Ronin47,Corny but very likable action comedy (**1/2),7,19 October 2003,"I hate wrestling. HATE it. So I'm a little surprised at just how much I like The Rock lately. I skipped out on ""The Scorpion King"", mostly because I didn't like the ""Mummy"" movies, but now that I've seen and been entertained by ""The Rundown"", there's no denying this fact: the guy is a star. And a likable, charismatic one at that.  I'm glad that he's probably stealing the ""next action star"" status from that greedy sourpuss Vin Diesel.
""The Rundown"" pairs The Rock with the equally likable, gifted comic actor Seann William Scott and the sexy, sultry Rosario Dawson for some wacky, ""Indiana Jones""-style action/adventure in the jungle. It's predictable and the pacing needs to be punched up a little, but for the most part it's a fun, entertaining ride.This is so close to a 3-star rating that it hurts, but though I mostly enjoyed it, it seems to just lack some special ingredient that could push it from ""fun"" to ""really fun"".It's worth seeing for The Rock, though. I have no interest in wrestling whatsoever, but this guy is COOL. He has yet to completely master the art of reciting his lines like they are his character's thoughts, but he has screen presence and charisma to spare. And several of the scenes between him and Seann William Scott are priceless.Also on hand as the big villain is a weird-as-ever Christopher Walken, surely the only actor who could convincingly deliver a line like ""You stupid.... ingrate.... oompa-loompa... morons!""",The Rundown
72,Benjamin_Cox,The let-down - 65%,6,22 July 2007,"Given the enormous popularity of The Rock on his WWE programmes, it was no great surprise that Vince McMahon decided to cast his biggest superstar in the first few films he produced. After a fairly anonymous debut in ""The Scorpion King"", The Rock gives this his everything in this old-skool action comedy but does it work? In parts, this is a highly entertaining picture but at times, it feels too forced and gimmicky to become a true classic. Pity.Dwayne Johnson (The Rock's real name) plays Beck, a hard-as-nails wannabe chef who works as a mob enforcer. Wishing to escape the life, Beck is offered one final job - retrieve his boss's archaeologist son Travis (Seann William Scott) who is hunting the Amazon for a priceless artifact. But Beck soon discovers that the job is a lot harder than it appears due to the reluctance of Travis to go back and the determination of gold-mining Hatcher (Christopher Walken), who employs most of the locals as slaves and who wants to get his hands on the artifact as well.Given that this is The Rock's movie (as he himself might say), it's no surprise that he runs rampant through ""Welcome To The Jungle"" (or ""The Rundown"" for viewers in the US). Scott and Walken provide support in varying degrees, however - Walken hams it up as the baddie but Scott provides a good comic partner for The Rock, even providing colour commentary during the fight scenes. And it's with the fight scenes that the film begins to unravel with blatant wire-work, carefully choreographed fight scenes and even some suspect CG scenes and backgrounds. The ""shark-jumping"" came with the tribesmen who were all high-flying kung-fu experts who easily kicked the previously unstoppable Beck's behind. There just feels a certain lack of finesse to the whole thing which sometimes feels a little rough around the edges. And just when you are won over with the horny monkeys (a genuine highlight of the film), Ewan Bremmer's surreal pilot brings the film back down to earth again in what is probably the weakest performance I've seen from him. Try and guess whether he's supposed to be Irish, Scottish or other - we still didn't know by the end of the film! There are certainly pluses to be found here, the biggest in every sense being The Rock. It's not quite as good as ""Walking Tall"" which is slightly better and more convincing than this but The Rock seems to be improving with every movie he does (though from what I've heard, ""Doom"" put a stop to that). His partnership with Scott is also a winning combination for me and one which might be worth revisiting in the future, given a stronger film and script. But ""Welcome To The Jungle"" fails to follow in the grand tradition of adventure movies due to its inconsistency. It peaks and troughs like the jungle mountains it was shot against, offering both genuine excitement and crippling boredom in equal measures. Stick with it and you may enjoy it but for me, it just wasn't entertaining enough to sustain my interest throughout. Signs of progress, though...",The Rundown

The renegade son, portrayed by Sean William Scott, isn't thrilled by the idea to say the least. Scott's character is actually doing some very interesting treasure hunting, and doesn't look like he's planning to return to the states until he's found what he's looking for.

I don't mind that a LOT of it was borrowed from other sources, because they borrowed from some goodies. It has the treasure seeking, pursuing army, and slide down a long hill into water from Romancing the Stone; the booby-trapped cave from Raiders of the Lost Ark (not to mention also shooting in Hawaii); and Christopher Walken's character evokes Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness -- he even mentions it toward the end the film. The story is woven together with TERRIFIC stunt work, and -- even before watching the DVD Extra Features -- it's quite apparent that Dwayne The Rock does a lot of his own stunts. This is also a very funny movie. I agree with another reviewer who said that Ahnold's cameo was a symbolic passing of the Action Hero torch.

77,davidemartin,Indiana Jones' TWINS in a jungle romp,8,13 September 2003,"Imagine Indiana Jones split into two beings, one representing his archaelogist self and the other his swashbuckler side.  That's conceptually what we have here.  While they exist separately they only truly succeed when the two halves are joined.Seann William Scott as Travis represents the archaeologist aspect of Jones. Like Jones he drops academia in pursuit of long lost shiny things of historical significance.  He also has a requisite ""Stiffler"" moment but on the whole he gets into the spirit of the flick well.Dwayne Johnson (I refuse to call him ""The Rock"") is the swashbuckler side, in this case a bookie's enforcer who just wants to quit and run a restaurant.  In case the audience somehow has doubts of his skills , there is a nicely executed gratuitous disco fight scene at the beginning, pitting Johnson against a bunch of even bigger guys.  It's a combination of WWE, Crouching Tiger, and discreet CGI manipulation but what the heck, it's fun to watch.  And with the fight scene out of the way, we can get along with the actual plot. It's not a bad little story, admittedly cobbled together from bits you've seen all over the place.  But at least the cobbler did a decent job sewing the different archetypes together.Christopher Walken does his standard issue slightly-tripped-out character as Hatcher, the mine operator.  It's pretty much the same guy we saw in GIGLI and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN but it's still fun to watch.Rosario Dawson is this flick's entry in the line of plucky gun-toting Hispanic heroines of flicks like PREDATOR and ALIENS.  She's a decent actress, not that the flick requires much in the way of thespian skills. But its to the film's credit that she is more than the resident sex object and lady-in-peril.  And I laugh thinking of the restraint the filmmakers had to employ to resist giving her a gratuitous skinnydipping scene.Two cameos to look for--  Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in the gratuitous disco scene and tells Johnson to ""have fun.""  I think he's speaking to the audience as well.  Looking at the shot of the two men standing together, you can tell it's been a loooooong time since CONAN.

78,udeaasykle,Pretty good simple action,6,23 March 2005,"Ooooh this has bad written all over it. The Rock and ""Stiffler"" in an action comedy. But hold on; don't judge this movie too fast. As far as action comedy goes, this is really pretty entertaining. Besides the two actors I have already mentioned, Christopher Walken does an excellent evil guy part in this film. When you have the Man, Christopher Walken as a bad guy, you know the movie can't totally suck. Realize that if you want a deep movie, don't rent this. But if you are in the easy going movie with fun moments and some cool actions sequences. For some odd reason, I find The Rock to be an easy person to like in movies. Unlike Van Damme, which I hate in everything. But back to Rundown; Lots of action and cool and funny scenes. Of course this is embroidered, but it is suppose to be. A pretty good easy, simple action comedy. Watch it and be entertained. I rate this movie 6/10",The Rundown
79,clydestuff,"""The Rock"" proves the skeptics, including myself wrong",8,28 September 2003,"When Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson appeared in his first starring role in The Scorpion King, I was highly skeptical.  I was sure that someone who made their fame and fortune in the wrestling world could not possibly become any kind of a screen star unless his films were solely supported by the die hard fans of the wrestling vaudeville shows.  In other words, I had to be carried kicking and screaming into the theater by a friend to see the aforementioned Scorpion King.  An exaggeration of course but you get the idea.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised.  The Scorpion King was not a particularly well made movie, but it did prove that The Rock had screen presence, was more than adequate at delivering his lines, and could carry a picture.  It was with great anticipation then that I entered the cinema to see The Rundown. I was more than a little curious to see if Johnson could fulfill the promise he showed of being the next action hero, given a different story and vehicle to display his talents.  I was not disappointed.Knowing when you go to see a film such as The Rundown that you will have to suspend your logic and belief in order to have a good time all one can ask in return is that the film makers give us a coherent script, a hero that we can believe would be able to do some of the amazing things asked of him even if we know logically he can't, enough humor to fill in the dead spots between the action scenes, and a supporting cast that is there for more than just eye candy.  With crisp direction by Peter Berg, a fun script by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt, and a cast of characters played to the hilt by The Rock, Seann William Scott, Rosario Dawson and Christopher Walken, The Rundown not only fulfilled this viewer's expectations, it surpassed them.Beck (The Rock)is sent by his boss to retrieve the boss's son Travis (Scott) from the Amazon and bring him back to the states.  The reasons why are vague but not that important.  If Beck is able to bring Travis back, the boss will forgive Beck's debt and Beck will be able to quit his job as a recoverer and open a restaurant.(yep, you read that right).  Once in the jungle, Beck finds out quickly things aren't going to be very easy, something the audience always knows before the film starts. It seems Travis just happens to know where a great treasure is hidden, and not only does Travis want to retrieve it, the villain Hatcher (Walken)wants it for himself, and Mariana (Dawson) the leader of a group of rebels wants her share also in order to help her people break free from the slavery they have been forced into by Hatcher.  If you can follow that storyline, that is all you need to know, as we are taken from one adventurous moment to the next.From the opening fight scene in a lounge with what seems like an entire football team, to a fight in a bar in the Amazon, to several fights in the jungle, then back to Walken's town, The Rock shows he is an able replacement for the likes of Schwarzenegger, and other aging action stars.  He has much more screen presence then Vin Diesel and is easily more likable.  A big plus is he's not afraid to look like he he's having fun with his role at any time, and seems to understand that people pay to see a film like this just to have fun and be entertained.  Unlike some action hero's he shows he can take a beating once in a while, but he makes us laugh out loud at the antics as a group of rebel fighters show him that size doesn't always matter.  By bringing Scott along for the ride, The Rock also shows that he can play off of other actors quite well.  It's as if The Rock and Scott have been making these pictures together for years their chemistry together is that good.Berg shows he can direct this kind of film.  He keeps the film going at a rapid click, as you won't be looking at your watch or fiddling with your soda straw to pass the time.  Walken has some good lines as the villain, and it's always fun to see him in this kind of role though in truth it doesn't require much.  I was also pleased that Dawson wasn't just thrown in as a sex object or something for the male audience to ogle.  Her role actually has a purpose in this film.When it comes to action/adventure films, I'm not easy to please.  The Rock and company shows us that there are still people who can make these kinds of films, without subjecting us to the nastiness, mean spiritedness and ultra-violent content of films like Bad Boys II.  Maybe Michael Bay could learn something.",The Rundown

It was really one of the better movies I have seen in a while because it was entertaining.  The biggest surprise for me was that the Rock actually can be a good actor. This is by far his best movie and if you are looking for a fun film, that is action packed and well acted, then I recommend the Rundown.

It got 3 1/2 stars from Ebert.  How wrong they were....!!!    This movie was a sub-B poor imitation of Romancing the Stone. The guy who played Stifler in American Pie was really miscast.   I wanted The Rock to kill him almost immediately to put us all out of our misery. The Rock was good enough as a kind of Kung Fu character, but, to compare him to Arnie or Stallone in their heyday is ludicrous.   The action never quite sucked you in nor did the sophomoric comedy.   If 5th grade comedy is what your want, look toward Disney who does it much better.  The special effects were right out of the 50's; did you see how they tossed around the big GOLD thing like it was cardboard?   I love Chris Walken and was looking forward to seeing a great Walken riff in this movie.  It never really happened; he just phoned it in.",The Rundown
82,imdb-19548,Enjoyable only if you can switch you brain off completely.,3,22 November 2007,"The is a completely mindless action film, the plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is bad. There is nothing here that you haven't already seen somewhere else done better.The characters are all action clichés but at least the leads are played well. Johnson is likable as the hero although the over-used pose of the hero who doesn't like guns (Indiana Jones anyone!) grates on the nerves very quickly as he keeps throwing weapons away instead of using them. Scott is good as a comedy side-kick although you will recognise his character from every other film he's been in, not much range in his acting so far. Walken is wasted in his role, his only chance to act is near the end and he hams it up in a cringe-worthy exit sequence.Unfortunately, for an action film, the action sequences are awful. They aren't even slightly believable. There is a spectacular jungle fight where, to facilitate the hero not using guns, everyone puts aside their weapons and fights using gymnastics in ways that don't make sense and are reminiscent of wrestling matches at their most fake. The end battle is the worst in the film with bullets flying and the bad guys somehow missing everything and Johnson literally tearing down buildings and flying when he jumps on a few occasions.If you want action watch one of the Bourne films don't waste your time on this.",The Rundown

Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was a hell of a macho man in this film kicking some serious @$$ and looking cool while doing it. And who cares if the plot was ""cheesy"" as some critics described it. And who cares if it didn't set the bar for movies to come. All I care is that it entertained the hell out of me. The action was thrilling. The actors were fit for their roles. And it was just as witty as it was action-filled. Truly entertaining cinema. Way to go Peter Berg and all involved in the making of this simple yet exhilarating film.",The Rundown
84,bdgill12,I hate the Rock so read accordingly,3,13 July 2011,"When debt collector/pseudo bounty hunter Beck (The Rock) want out of the business, his boss, Walker (William Duckling), sends him on one last mission. Beck heads to Brazil to track down Walker's son Travis (Sean William Scott) and bring him back to the States. It seems like an easy enough task until Beck finds himself in the middle of a cultural war between the locals and slumlord Hatcher (Christopher Walken).Apparently I didn't learn from my own Rock-related lesson with ""Planet 51."" Maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. Either way, Netflix delivered me another craptastic action movie starring The Rock (who, again, I will not call Dwayne Johnson until he proves he can act) and I watched. I'd actually heard good things about ""The Rundown"" from people I trust so I'm willing to admit that my Rock prejudice may have gotten in the way here. But...THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!!! Truthfully, The Rock isn't even the worst part. He's up there, sure, but he's the secondary issue. The real problem here is the movie's identity crisis as defined by director Peter Berg. Let me be clear: I'm a big fan of Berg. The three movies he did after ""The Rundown"" (""Friday Night Lights"", ""The Kingdom"", and ""Hancock"") are all extremely strong, especially those first two. Maybe he just hadn't found his groove yet when he made this thing or maybe he just hitched his wagon to the wrong fake movie star. Regardless, this thing can't figure out whether it's a serious action movie or an over-the-top send up. I can enjoy either one. I'm not against absurdity when it's done right and even when it's done wrong I can usually just give it a pass on the grounds of no harm, no foul. But I can't get on board for a movie that jumps back and forth across the Ridiculous Line. One minute it seems like ""The Rundown"" wants to be legit, the next The Rock is flying through the air like freaking Peter Pan. I feel like this movie would have fit in fine in the 80s but ""Die Hard"" changed the game for action movies. If Berg had gone all-in and thrown together an 80s homage/throwback flick (like ""The A-Team"" for instance) then I think it's possible that I could get past The Rock sinking every scene like the on-screen dead weight he is. But as it is, the stupidity of the plot and the juvenile comedy (can any movie that features a monkey humping a human be considered funny?) just accentuate how bad The Rock is.The Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",The Rundown

87,jake-179,"A fun ride, a good action flick, lots of adventure.",8,29 September 2003,"You have two options:  You can go see this movie and sit in the theatre and have a good time.  Or, you can skip this movie and miss out on a great bunch of fun, cool visuals, and tons of action with lots of laughs.  This is a good action movie.  All of the characters are likable, even the bad guy who is played well by Chris Walken.  Walken did a great job not taking himself too seriously.  The movie has a great pace without any dull moments.  The production quality is slick. I was struck a little odd by the pro football style graphics in the first fight scene, but I liked it.  It was well done and something I had not seen before in a movie.  The movie is over the top in most places, but it is done consistently throughout the film so to me that makes it acceptable.A lot of people have commented that the action is too much ""over the top."" In particular, I know people were unable to buy the part when the jeep goes over a cliff that is about a thousand feet high.  But to defend the movie, I would say that it is just a fun ride.  And since the movie does not take itself seriously, I was ok with the impossible stunts.  The movie actually does deliver quite a few laughs.  People in the theatre were audibly laughing outloud on many occasions.  The movie was much funnier than I expected it to be.Now to comment on the writing of the script.  It is very well done.  There are basically four ""forces"" in the script who are all clearly motivated and have clear relationships with eachother.  The relations come from the characters needs and wants, which are all unique but connect them to the other characters.  The Rock want's to retrieve Sean to get out of the bounty hunting business; Sean wants to stay in South America to retrieve a golden idol so he can become a famous and rich archeologist; Rosario wants the idol to free her people; and Chris Walken wants the idol for his own greedy needs.  These motivations lead to very good, motivated conflict.  And since conflict is the essence of drama, this provides for a great story.  The story flows along as the characters try to work out compromises with eachother in order to satisfy their own needs and wants.  This leads to raising the steaks and steadily heightening the action.  As the characters bargain with eachother, their relationships change.  For example, when the Rock first tries to find Sean Scott, he goes to Hatcher, played by Chris Walken.  He tells him directly what he wants.  He wants Travis (Scott) to come home with him.  Hatcher says no, because he needs Travis to stay. The bargaining begins, and Hatcher agrees to let Travis go if Beck (The Rock) gives up 10 thousand bucks.  Beck agrees.  But then, when he goes to get Travis, Hatcher shows up with his army and tries to renig on his deal with Beck because Hatcher's character is driven by greed.  This changes the relationship betwee Beck and Hatcher, and obviously leads to the next logical level of elevated action, which is a big fight scene.  By the way, in that fight scene there is a really cool shot when the bullwhip guy tries to whip Beck and Beck throws a table up in the air to block the bullwhip and the whip cuts RIGHT through the table in mid air.  I thought that was a really cool shot.  The movie is full of that kind of escalated conflict and cool shots.By the way, that is Ernie Reyes Jr. playing the part of Manito.  It is good to see Ernie back on the big screen.  The fight between him and Beck is pretty cool, despite the ridiculous wire work.  If you watch, you will see some great Capoiera.  I had no idea Ernie was so good in Capoiera.  And it appears that Ernie did a couple of butterfly twists WITHOUT the assistance of a WIRE RIG.  In American action movies these days, every character seems to do a butterfly twist, ever since THE MATRIX came out.  But they are always on wires, and I can always tell.  But it looks like Ernie didn't need the wires.  Just in case you don't know, let me tell you first hand that the BUTTERFLY TWIST is SUPER DUPER hard to do.  I have been working on that move for almost two years and now I can only KIND OF do it.  I have smashed myself up pretty bad over the past countless months trying to get that move, and I have huge respect for anybody that can do that trick.  It is great to see Hollywood utilizing someone who can actually do the trick.
Rosario Dawson is the really the only person in the movie that bothered me. She clearly needed to work with her dialect coach a little more.  Her accent was painful!Also, I didn't like seeing Arnold in a cameo.  Clearly, he was ""passing the batton"" to Dwayne Johnson as a new action star.  I am Arnold's absolute BIGGEST fan, and to me it was not cool to see him handing off to Johnson like that.  Arnold could still kick Dwayne's butt any day.  Arnold is and has been the greatest action star of all time.  He is the greatest muscle/action man the screen has ever known and probably will ever know. In fact, the only real reason people like Dwayne Johnson are moving on to the big screen from places like Pro Wrestling is because Arnold laid all the ground work and created the world wide demand for an over-the-top, testosterone driven smashing machine action star.  Now that Arnold has gotten older, there is a void in Hollywood that studios are desperately trying to fill.This is no knock against The Rock, however.  He is likable on screen and I am sure we will see a lot more good action movies from him.  And I will go see them!  But he is NO ARNOLD.  Just like the T-Shirt always said, ARNOLD IS NUMERO UNO.",The Rundown
88,filmbuff-36,Both good action and The Rock almost save a routine picture,7,6 October 2003,"There is a very telling moment early in the film when Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's character passes Arnold Schwarzenegger in a nightclub, who simply tells him ""Have fun"" as he walks out the door. This detail has caught the attention of other critics as well, who suggest Schwarzenegger is symbolically bestowing the title of ""top muscled action star' to a new usurper.""I'm not sure if it's premature to jump to this conclusion, but The Rock definitely has the stature and charisma to live up to the title, though he still has not selected the correct film to showcase his talents.""The Rundown"" is indeed a lively action-comedy with some great moments  a big, dumb but unapologetically fun B-movie. But it rarely becomes more than just an excuse for onscreen disasters and cartoon violence, and worse, it's an action movie that thinks it's an adventure movie, and therefore does not really succeed at being either.The Rock plays Beck, a large raging bull whose job is to hunt down guys who have outstanding debts and remind them, sometimes physically, to repay. What Beck really longs for though is to open a family restaurant, and takes jobs strong-arming for money sharks to raise the needed cash. He agrees to take on one last job for his top employer Walker, which means he must travel down to Brazil and collect Walker's son Travis (Seann William Scott) before the boy gets himself killed.Travis, meanwhile, has stumbled onto clues that might lead him to El Gato Diablo, a legendary golden idol that is worth millions. He's about to head on his quest when Beck shows up, determined to return Travis to Los Angeles whether the boy wants to go or not. This however proves troublesome when local gold cartel leader Hatcher (Christopher Walken) discovers Travis knows about the idol, and wants the boy to lead him to it.Travis doesn't want to share the idol and Beck doesn't want to give up Travis, so the two are forced to flee Hatcher together. However, they soon become lost in the jungle, and are forced to put aside their differences if they want to survive against rebels, Hatcher's forces, and even a few horny monkeys.""The Rundown"" has the energy and determination to be a great adventure movie, but it lacks the epic scale, and more importantly the self-confidence. This is more like a B-movie spoof of Hollywood A-list films, with the filmmakers revealing once too often that they didn't take this film seriously.The Rock manages to hold his own in this one, and though his acting talents seem to range from indifferent to really mad, he manages to maintain his dignity through the picture and delivers a fairly convincing character who remains calm until that's not an option any more. He's definitely a step up here from last year's ""The Scorpion King,"" and for the most part behaves the way I'd hope most sane people would under similar circumstances, which given this type a movie is a major surprise.Scott on the other hand invests Travis with no likable personality traits, and acts like a complete buffoon in any and all situations. It's really hard to like most characters that take nothing seriously, and while Scott's goofy camera mugging and silly squirrel face might work in the ""American Pie"" series, here it just looks stupid and unrealistic. Why Scott seems to be becoming a mainstream movie star still remains a mystery to me.Walken seems to enjoy himself playing Hatcher, but he comes across more like he's spoofing himself on ""Saturday Night Live"" than playing a hardened crime lord. Hatcher makes an analogy at one point comparing stealing the Gato Diablo from him with taking the money the tooth fairy leaves. The joke is long and pointless, and I can only assume it was added because someone thought it would sound funny coming out of Walken's mouth. This philosophy seems to hold true with everything Walken says or does in this movie.As a director, Peter Berg is resourceful and sets up his scenes expertly. The fight choreography is sharp and Berg even manages to slow things down nicely for quiet moments. One thing is for certain, the movie is never boring, and for better or worse, he gets lively performances out of everybody.One good thing is the screenplay avoided the cliché of having Beck and Travis become friends. Sure, mutual respect is eventually reached but at the end of the film it's still clear the Beck would rather be somewhere else than around Travis, and I hope most sane people would agree.""The Rundown"" does have some neat surprises and as a star vehicle, The Rock seems primed to contend with today's top stars for action pieces. But the movie ultimately fails in the storytelling department, with characters going from one action set piece to another. For the most part it's about on par with most summer offerings, but with a strong performance by the lead it stands out against most action fluff. Considering that crowd, that's really saying a lot.7 (really more like 6 and one-half) out of 10 stars. You get plenty of popcorn action between Scott and Walken's horrible camera mugging, and The Rock actually brings this up a notch.",The Rundown
89,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of The Rundown,8,26 September 2003,"Do you smeeeeeelll what the Rock is cooking? Well The Rock has been cooking up a whole load of goodies ever since his less then stellar debut on the WWF circuit. Not only has his popularity in the wrestling ring improved greatly from the days of `Rocky Sucks!' but he has been able to do what few fellow wrestlers can: Break away with a successful acting career. After a largely hyped appearance in The Mummy Returns, Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson starred in the Mummy spin-off film, The Scorpion King, which was able to gross $84 million in the summer of 2002 and have him labeled as the next action star. Universal Pictures, seeing the great investing potential of this former wrestling icon, quickly signed him up with his next project teaming The Rock up with Seann William Scott, who has already had success this year with American Wedding. Dwayne Johnson has been able to work well in the action area but can he bring comedy into the mix? The studio definitely hopes so after investing $75 million in The Rundown (aka `Helldorado' aka `Welcome to the Jungle') and releasing it in a time period that is not known to have too many top earners.The story centers on a hit-man who's out for one last job but this small assignment is more then he bargained for. Beck, an efficient man for hire, is not the normal kind of person in his line of profession. He gives people options, he would prefer cooking to fighting, and hates to use guns. After a brawl in a bar one night, Beck decides he wants out but his boss isn't going to let him off so easy. He sends him out on one more job: Travel to the Amazon, picking up his no-good son, and bring him back to the house. If he completes the job, he gets out of the hit-man profession and can open his own restaurant, the one thing he seems most passionate about. Beck believes this will just be another typical job but things change quickly. Not only does he have to deal with horny monkeys and quarrelsome natives, Beck knocks horns with Hatcher, the ruthless tyrant of Helldorado. Both men are after the same thing and both will do anything to get him but the question lies on who wants him more? The story for The Rundown is, quite surprisingly, fabulous. This is quite possibly one of the most original action/comedy films of the year with a wonderful blend of well choreographed fight scenes, hilarious comedy, and a balanced story to back it all up.Though the cast is small, most members perform beyond expectations while others achieve the normal acting level. Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson flattens Stalone, Willis, and even Schwarzenegger becoming the next cultural action star. Every fight sequence is packed wall to wall with high testosterone action and The Rock proving he can kick some serious ass in a grand style. And who knew he could be so funny? Well, a good amount of people who saw him perform on Saturday Night Live last year, but outside of that group, not many. For those not lucky enough to catch that one of the few truly funny SNL episodes in recent years (And, yes, the show has been pretty bad for a couple of years now), he proves all the skeptics wrong in this film. Seann William Scott, who performed earlier this year in Bulletproof Monk and American Wedding (the latter being the much bigger success), sure proves he has the comedic idiot act down pat though not as hilarious as he was in the last American Pie film. Perhaps it was the absence of using the F-bomb so many times but maybe it was the fact that the movie-going public isn't use to seeing him as the idiotic yet nice guy in comedies. Christopher Walken, as usual, never fails to amaze us. Once again he is able to mix comedy and drama well together without balancing one or the other. There were several jokes made by the talented actor that took awhile to get the point of but when the punch-line came, the jokes really paid off. And Rosario Dawson, a not too well known performer, was moderate at best but the main problem was that, as semi-important as her character was, wasn't featured as much as she should have been. There weren't too many that showed off her acting chops, which is quite a shame since there could have been plenty of potential had they allowed her to showcase her talent.Overall, The Rundown smashes, blasts, and bombards the movie theater with everything its got and, quite surprisingly, the audience is left wanting more, which, for once, isn't a bad thing. Dwayne `The Rock' Johnson proves he can live up to all the hype declaring him as this generation's action star and shows off some true acting chops that few from his former line of work can do. As good as the film was, it wasn't quite as funny as other comedies like American Wedding were. The problem lied in the fact that The Rundown took awhile to really get going by setting up a decent back story and stuff like that, which can be good on its own but when you're dealing with a buddy comedy such as this, it can come off as being a bit of a disappointment. The time length of the feature seemed a little too short but this is quite a minor squabble compared to all the praise one can say about this film. The Rundown is another valiant effort from The Rock and Universal Pictures that proves action flicks can be funny, intense and dramatic all in the same feature without outbalancing itself.My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)",The Rundown

The opening sequence is done really well. I just love watching one guy kicking a bunch of other guys' a..es, and he was so nice and polite about it, trying to avoid hurting 'the team'. The supporting actors were all good or better. The Rock has talent and screen presence. Good effects. So its an 8. Its barely an 8 because the plot is mostly formula, there's no wild baboons in South America and Native South Americans don't have a unique indigenous highly developed martial arts style. So let's say its an 8-rated action movie because its fun to watch. You know the hero is indestructible and just like in 'WWF' will get up and dust himself off after being half-beaten to death or falling off a cliff.The DVD has some good stuff on it. The crew had fun making the movie and there was a lot of joking around in the featurettes rather than a bunch of self-congratulations. The Rock has a double that could be his twin.

On the other hand the movie was well shot with carefully selected good scenery that brought reasonable exotic to the audience. Some jokes were really funny, although entire humor was as usual vulgar and silly Fight scenes look very typical for The Rock and they were quite different during the movie. While some of such action sequences were not bad a all most of them look only ridiculous and unreal. Overall The Rundown is nothing more than a silly action/adventure movie.

Rosario Dawson also adds flare in portraying a strong woman although her accent is kind of shaky. Christopher Walken is great and manages to bring originality to any movie and his performance here is no exception. I enjoyed every minute of of it and would recommend it to anyone who loves action movies.

He is bold and buff, and exudes a certain likability, but as this lame screenplay demonstrates, as an action hero he is much more likely to be undone by 90 minutes of banalities masquerading as a script, stitched together by the attendant perfunctory explosions and predictable fight scenes, than by the evil plans (or brigades of thugs) commanded by a stock movie  villain. Aspects of the plot of ""The Rundown"" are borrowed from a wide spectrum of movie standards, generously dosed with politically correct platitudes. Working as a debt collector for a loan shark while secretly clinging to his plans of opening a restaurant (strong, yes, but sensitive too, is he), the Rock accepts an assignment to retrieve the dissolute son of his employer (Stifler) from a remote Amazon village in exchange for clearing his own debt. We are led to believe that the Rock has a code of honor which involves fairplay, being a man of his word, and abjuring the use of firearms. Each of these is mentioned, and is factored into the script, but none are fully developed, and so they just end up as so many more loose ends sloppily strewn about the set.  Stifler, we are asked to believe, is an archeologist who has found the secret chamber of an ancient indigenous idol (borrowed heavily from Indians Jones' milieu). A beautiful rebel leader agrees with the Rock to lead them from the jungle in exchange for the idol.  Despite her apparent abandonment of this pact, (at the expense of the Rock and Stifler) the Rock somehow interprets her subsequent capture by the bad guys as having left him not holding up his part of the bargain, and charges into the fray to effect her rescue.  His efficacy and the ensuing lethal results seem no more pernicious when he is compelled to break his personal vow (never fully explained, and rather odd for someone in his line of work) of forswearing the employment of firearms, and a shotgun soon adds to the general mayhem. Christopher Walken reprises his villain-as-weirdo role from that James Bond movie, this time mining gold in a most environmentally unfriendly fashion, and exploiting the poor Amazonians.  We have seen it all before as he blusters across the set intermittently, as though wondering how he ended wasting his time with this movie. Sadly enough, it is very possible indeed that this feeling will be shared by the viewer.",The Rundown
95,nxgn_not_not,Eye Candy,3,5 June 2004,"Some movies simply require that you check your thought process @ the door. Fun to look @ and stuff popcorn down, but one usually comes away with an aching gut. That being said, I had fun.Things I liked: Rosario Dawson making it happen  S. W. Scott D. D. Johnson buddy chemistry  ESPN drop down stats  visuals associated with the fruitThings I had difficulty with: falling off the cliff like it was nothing  - The Jeep hanging in the air while they roll and bounce down the cliff face  people flying through the air when they get hit or kicked  thousands of people in an open pit mine with no infrastructure  no love action even implied",The Rundown
96,shiftyeyeddog,"A whole lotta fun, and the Rock proves himself worthy",10,20 September 2003,"""Have Fun"" ...and with those words, the torch was passed. With a two word, half-a-second cameo, Arnold Schwarzenegger seemingly passed his action hero title to the man who would be: ""The Rock"" Dwayne Johnson.This movie is a blast. The laughs, while largely given away in the trailer, are numerous, and the action just as fun. The Rock proves he has the talent and personality to be a big star in films, and I for one am anxious to see him in more. As long as he picks the right projects for his style, like this one, he'll go far. Seann William Scott was surprisingly entertaining in this one as well, almost making up for his over-the-top turn as Stifler in this summer's American Wedding. The chemistry between the two of them worked wonderfully, and while the second half wasn't quite as fun as the first, it still delivers all the way through.What I do hate, though, is that I noticed three trailer moments not in the finished film. The ""face like a weasel"" line, the ""you guys fight HARD"" line, and one of the best trailer moments, Walken's ""ow!"" Sure it sounds petty, but why remove some of the lines that got the biggest laughs in the marketing of the film?All in all, I'm happy this movie didn't disappoint. Peter Berg (Very Bad Things) is now two-for-two, Seann William Scott proved he can be fun, and Dwayne Johnson, as soon as he loses ""The Rock"" moniker, will be a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. The downside? The ""WWE"" thinks they now produce great actors, so they've actually formed a production company, and are already planning films featuring their wrestlers. They need to understand Dwayne is the exception in their ranks, not the norm. (remember Hulk Hogan's attempts, anyone? Rowdy Roddy Piper's?)",The Rundown
97,churei,Stealing from The Rock,7,22 December 2017,"Fine photography and scenic wonders are all there in this film, but, oddly, it is a youthful Seann William Scott who steals this film from star Dwayne Johnson and everything else. The story, naturally, is silly...but it has humor and lots of action scenes. In fact, almost all of it is action, often with comedic touches that are played well by the two men. Johnson has charisma, but Scott is in his element, offering the kind of zany performance, and good looks, that should have propelled him to more important and jucier roles. Not a bad film to sit through on a rainy or snowy night. You won't be bored.",The Rundown
98,ThatsGoodInnit,A must see for all action lovers!,8,18 July 2006,"I can tell you, without a doubt, this is 1 of 2 of the rocks best movies, the other being Walking Tall, With crackin action scenes, fights, explosions, and cool stunts, made this a blockbuster smash for all action fan junkies, it's a great adventure, with some nice 1 liners and dumb comedy sequences, it's a great film to watch with your mates, and other people you have a laugh with, of course not ideal for kids but older kids will enjoy it! you could easily watch this with a girlfriend also, it's light hearted fun! done the kick arse Dwayne Johnson way, this is why he became an action star and gave up wrestling, he was born for this! what also makes this film great is a classic pop up seen of an Old action star passing the new action star in a quick sequence with Arnold Schwarzenegger. This gets 8 stars from me, and well earnt as well, the Title isn't much to go by tho, it makes it sound kinda tacky, and i can assure you it ain't, stick to the American name The Rundown, much cooler.",The Rundown
99,CyMaddux,The Letdown,4,11 November 2005,"Unrealistic, poor acting, terrible story-line what more is there to ask for? Well you get the rock and stifler fall down a 200 ft mountain face and not break a bone.. You also get to see the Rock do his best Rambo impersonation and get shot at a million times and not get hit. There is little in this movie that is worth spending the time on. If you are a hardcore fan of the rock or stifler then you might actually like the stupid dialog that between them for most of half the movie. So, take heed this is a comedy at its best, not much adventure and surely not anything worth any awards to mention of. The CD does have some good bonus features and is quite comedic by itself at some times.",The Rundown
100,x111b3825,Look what the Rock is Cookin'!,10,27 September 2003,"Don't listen to the naysayers that want to over analyze this next to the likes of some Fellini film or or Citizen Kane.This movie rocks and probably will establish Dwayne Johnson (aka ""The Rock"") solidly as the next action star.  Watch out for those bad action movie plots Dwayne...they're a killer.The story is just a fun action romp until it gets a little too serious with the rebel versus Demon Christopher Walken subplot, but director Peter Berg, better known as an actor, should have no problem garnering monies for future projects after this.Smartly done, the effects are solid, the locations real and very lush in the Amazon jungle and the acting, regardless of what anyone going after the Rock's past history as an entertainer might say, is really quite solid.
The bottom line is this...look, if you can just for a moment try to suspend your disbelief and go with the flow, this movie will be a lot of fun for you and you will enjoy every second of it like many viewers (myself included) have.  On the other hand, if you want to show your knowledge of the amount of hard earned cash you and your parents spent on that film school education that still has you selling Cutco knives door to door, analyzing every little flaw and plot point as if every film should be looked at as if through the eyes of Sergei Eisenstein and acting, evaluated on the merits of a particular method...bore yourself somewhere else and spend the evening rewinding ""A Woman Under the Influence"" and writing your Memoirs...Otherwise, chill, enjoy, and Rock on!",The Rundown
101,Mr.Uxo,A Runaway Success,10,12 October 2003,"While the Rock is running down Stifler, this movie is running away with my pick for comedy of the year. The Rundown is very entertaining and the acting surprisingly good from the three stars, The Rock, Stifler, and Christoper Walken. Action scenes are explosive, fight scenes are realistic and the scenery is spectacular. You'd never know this movie was filmed in Hawaii. I definetely recommend the Rundown to anyone wanting an entertaining film.",The Rundown
102,snake77,An insult to action movies,2,17 October 2003,"Amazingly, the best thing about this film is the Rock, who it seems can actually act.  My advice to Duane-baby is to get a new agent pronto.  Cause if he keeps making turgid, lame, unfunny action movies like this his acting career will be over faster than you can say WWF.  Director Peter Berg has managed to fashion an astoundingly bad film from a pretty good idea.  Even just an once of inspiration coupled with the Rock's charisma could have saved this movie, but it just rolls out one dumb cliché, bad joke and stupid bit of dialogue after another.  Stifler and Rosario Dawson's talents are wasted, I think Christopher Walken needs to be taken aside and told ""hey -you're a great actor, you really don't need to do this anymore"".  When Arnold passes by the Rock and whispers ""good luck"" in an uncredited cameo, I think it was maybe not because he's passing the action hero torch but because he'd seen the dailies.",The Rundown
103,robnels2000,Stupid,1,25 January 2005,"There's nothing more to say.There was a better story in the Scorpion King.I thought I'd give this movie a chance; every one I know said it was good. It was like watching the A-Team, lots of gun fire and explosions but no one can hit the good guy walking down the middle of the street, but every one of his shots, usually from the hip, hits a bad guy or two every time, even when they are under cover. I guess Hollywood figures only the good guys know how to aim a gun.I love suspension of disbelief movies but there are limits.This was just 90 minutes of time",The Rundown
104,theguys1,Christopher Walken ruined it,7,28 July 2005,"**SPOILERS** While all the cool explosions and action scenes are happening in this movie, the camera shows a close-up of this guy's face and he makes an unfunny joke like, ""That's a lot of cows"" or ""Boom, Boom, Boom."" This is supposed to be an action adventure flick and with Christopher Walken speaking with such boring poetry that sounds like it came from the 1700's, this movie really starts to tank after a while. I'm saying honestly and openly that Christopher Walken does not belong in this movie and the movie is not exactly The Rock's big break. I'm not trying to forbid you from seeing this picture, because all the scenes without Walken are all right. I hope Rock stars in better movies than this and isn't teamed up with Walken again, cause it won't work.",The Rundown
105,sixtwentysix,A buddy/road film with chemistry.,9,21 April 2004,"When shylock Beck (The Rock) is requested to do... oh here it comes... ""one last job"". If you're trying to leave the job you're at, don't accept that ""last job"". Hell, if you work for a mob boss don't even give two weeks notice. Anyway the priority for the mob boss is retriving his neer-do-well son from a South American jungle location. Beck encounters a host of trials and entertaining characters. The movie starts at lightning speed with it's night club setting, showing Beck to be a humble but without a doubt a tough guy just trying to do his job. His past unknown to the audience is mysterious and interesting. Known for alway seeing his jobs through he shows himself as a willing and able skip tracer. The opening action scenes is one of the most fun I've seen in recent memory being both entertaining and engaging you in the character's style.Sean Williams provides a perfect comic foil adding just enough lighthearted humor to make this buddy/road adventure movie able to step away from the buddy/road adventure cliches. Walken provides a very serviceable villain with great lines and an interesting screen presence.Overall the movie puts a fresh new take on jungle adventure movies with only a couple stinky ideas for forced commercial shock value (the monkey) and a wasted oppertunities for development. (Ernie Reyes) The chemistry was wonderful and I really hope the writers can come back and bring Beck into a city setting for a sequel as he seemed more well suited to a cityscape. The Rock isn't doing himself any favors with these films where he looks like a hillbilly or barbarian but he thrives as what he is in this film, a soft talking, smooth collections expert. I attended the Chicago premier of this film and it was very well received by the audience and Ebert/Roper who were in attendance. Inexplicably released at a bad time of the year, despite a hefty ad budget, I read that the film did not perform as well as the studio had hoped. There is a lot to build on should a sequel be risked however. I think by toning down the budget, a sequel has a chance at being a huge success. Ah what the heck do I know... I honestly loved this movie and I hope should you give it a chance and check it out you enjoy it too.",The Rundown

Well when the wait ended I was so happy because I absolutely loved this movie. The Rock is actually a very good actor as he has proved in his other movies prior to this one and the ones after. The fight scenes in these movies were great, and some of the very best i've ever seen. Sean William Scott did a great job and made me and the entire audience laugh the entire time. I bought this movie and every time I watch it with friends they love it too. Christopher Walken did an excellent bad guy I thought too.

107,shortround8391,Moronic,3,13 July 2007,"This has gotta be the most overrated action movie I've ever seen. ""The Rundown"" is basically one of those movie that have all brawn but no brains and Christopher Walken seriously needs to stop trying to play the bad guy because he sucks at it, and he sucked in ""A View to a Kill"", you can check that movie out yourself, because from then until 2003 he gave the most faceless performance of his career in that and in ""The Rundown"" he sucked even more and it looks to me that ""Balls of Fury"" will be even worse.The dialogue and the story was hilariously stupid. Not only was the script really retarded but it was very repetitive, too many lines were being repeated too much, and I HATED that stupid ""Option A or Option B"" line and the ""You Like thunderstorms big boy?"" The plot was really gay, these guys were actually trying to copy the Indiana Jones movies with them getting that stupid artifact just made a story that COULD happen into something ridiculous.The only thing that I liked about the movie was the action, it was great there's no denying that, but something I don't get is that throughout the movie he doesn't use guns and all of the sudden uses them toward the end. The idea of a one guy taking out an entire military without using firearms would've been pretty cool, but the moment The Rock picked up the rifle and started shooting totally ruined it. But seriously, what kind of goon would use whips as weapons, talk about being queer....",The Rundown
108,vn_larsen1,"I love this movie, probably why I didn't notice this before...",8,14 September 2018,"I really do enjoy this movie. Sean William Scott is hilarious, just as always. And how knew the Rock could be funny too?! Anyway, all the fun I always have watching the movie is probably the reason I never before noticed how stupid and nonsensical the ending truly is. And only for one simple reason: why on earth did he bring Travis all the way back to his dad in LA if he was just going to drug him and let Travis runaway? What was the point? He could have called or something and just said he couldn't find him, sorry. Instead he actually brings him to his dad and then betrays him just to piss him off? Like what? Makes no sense to me. But other this ending, great movie.",The Rundown
109,The_Rook,The Rundown,10,11 April 2018,"It my opinion one Dwayne Johnson's greatest roles. The intro of football players in on the field action shots as he spots them in the bar is new and a brilliant add. Perfect for a bounty hunter preparing to take them on if necessary to collect a debt. The backstory of him wanting to be a chef and jotting down cooking ingredients for recipes is another clever hook. Then to have him go to the jungle to grab a clients son begins the real action. The movie is tight and well edited so that you don't see unnecessary filler. The cast is excellent and make you want more time with everyone of them, even the evil Christopher Walken character. With such a brilliant premise it was disappointing when a sequel wasn't quick to follow. To this day I think they should do one. Johnson is still doing action roles and is even a more seasoned actor. I hope someone will write a screen story and get it made.",The Rundown

111,trvolk,A Future Staple of Cable TV,8,28 September 2003,"If you surf cable TV, expect The Rundown to turn up quite often in your future. This is the kind of movie that TBS Superstation repeats ad nauseum. It is a well-written action movie with insignificant plot holes, and the pacing is such that you never have enough time to run to the snack bar. Witty, fast-paced, sassy and brassy.Admittedly, The Rock is quite ham-handed at acting, but he does comedy very well. Not only does he deliver punchlines adeptly, but his real strength is as a straight man, setting up the payoff with aplomb and then reacting with tolerant dignity. Amazingly, The Rock is every bit the equal to Christopher Walken's villainy. Overall, a very satisfying confection.",The Rundown
112,sbrobin,Pretty bland for an action film,4,28 March 2004,"My friends saw this film and like it.  It has a decent review on IMDB, and it received some good reviews when it came out in theaters.  That's why I was so disappointed when I actually saw it.""The Rundown"" is nothing more than a Steven Seagall clone with better actors.  The film has great cinematography, some nice action sequences, incredible fight scenes, but is sideswiped by an incredibly weak plot.  The director tries to create personalities for each of the characters, but fails miserably.  I couldn't figure out during this film if there was supposed to be a love connection between Mariana and Travis or not.  It's hinted at but not explained.  At one point it looked like there would be one between her and Beck.  Her entire character could have been removed from the film and it would have made no difference.The story also tries to set up some type of past history about The Rock and how he hates guns, yet never expands on it further than having him say he doesn't use guns because ""bad things happen.""  Was he in the military?  Did he kill someone?  No, it's just an excuse to have him use his fists more, all up until the end when that' all thrown out of the window.Most importantly, why does Travis' father want his son back so badly?  Does he plan on holding him captive when he gets home? Why is Beck indebted to his father anyway?  This film is LOADED with confusing plot holes, and it would have made more sense to dumb it down and just remove all the extraneous backstories.  However, the most ridiculous part of the story is the completely pointless cameo by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is simply shown at a bar passing The Rock and saying ""have fun.""  ""Have fun?"" What does this mean?  I have tried to figure out, and seen this question debated endlessly with no resolution.  They simply thought it would be cool to have him in the movie.  At the very least they could have given him a line that made sense or had his cameo contribute to the film instead of leaving the viewer bewildered.  As I said, the acting is acceptable, and The Rock does a decent job, much more than I'd expect from watching his wrestling performances.  However the attempts at humor inserted into the film are horrible.  Sean Williams Scott has some type of ""thunder and lightning"" fighting routine that is supposed to be funny, but comes off as just plain embarrassing.  This isn't an ""American Pie"" sequel, it's an action movie.  Save the lame comedy bits for something else, or insert routine that are actually funny. Forced comedy also fails with Ewen Bremner, who is inserted into this film s another additional character the film could do without.  He has a few lines during the film, but at the end the director gives him a Scottish accent and tries to get a few jokes out of him.  Those wasted two minutes could have been better used just having The Rock beat up some more people.
The other part where the acting fails however, is with Walken.  Thankfully, he leaves his trademark accent concealed during the movie, but he just doesn't come off as a believable villain.  He's not tough enough, and for this type of film, there should be a final showdown between The Rock and the bad guy, not the weak anticlimactic scene that fills up the last 5 minutes of the movie.",The Rundown

An example being the bird noises, he did exactly the same thing in ""Evolution"", it wasn't too funny then and it's even less funny second time around.Walken is usually always reliable but the script does him no favours, cringe as he acts the tough guy through telling a story of the tooth fairy.it's as entertaining as wrestling!",The Rundown

The movie morales teaches us about trust on people who can't be trusted. The Rock's morales of never ever using a weapon unless threaten is a great piece of advice that makes him a great role model for children and young adults everywhere.      The special effects are simply spectacular as well as the drama within the movie.  This movie definitely puts him to the new generation of action superstars such as Bruce Willis and the now governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

I suspected based on the cast that I couldn't possibly be in for anything more than a poorly acted, cliche-riddled action flick.  Well, I got that and much more.

116,shinymc_shine,Not Quite A Touchdown.,7,4 February 2004,"""Welcome To The Jungle"" aka ""The Rundown"" is a buddy adventure comedy in the tradition of Martin Brest's ""Midnight Run"" with shades of the Indiana Jones franchise. It's overall an OK movie that feels as though it's been padded with constant shots of the jungle, some of which we've seen more than once. The pacing is a little sluggish at times but there is much to admire in Peter Berg's sophmore directorial effort. The Rock plays a chef who is working off an undisclosed debt as muscle for a shady loan shark. He has one last job to do which is to retrieve the loan shark's son, played by Seann William Scott, who is hiding in the Amazon. Scott is searching for a mystical relic in a mining town controlled by a business entrepreneur/dictator played by Christopher Walken. But Walken won't let the two leave unless he is told where the location of the priceless relic is. So the unlikely duo team up with a bar owner/freedom fighter, played by Rosario Dawson, to find the relic in order to sell it on the black market and have enough money to run Walken and his men out of town.The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson is extremely charismatic and is the obvious forerunner for action star of the noughties. This is his third acting gig and already has proven himself to be a great screen presence. With Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone pushing middle age, The Rock should easily be able to step into their shoes. Due to years of being a wrestler under his belt he is physically strong and has the theatrical sense of a showman.Scott seems to be playing himself though he's not as crude as his ""American Pie"" persona. He has a best friend quality about him as though we know him personally. The pairing of The Rock and Scott is alot more successful than, say, the partnership of Scott and Chow Yun-Fat in ""Bulletproof Monk"". Both of them are likable and seem to be genuine guys.Walken is his usual flamboyantly evil self. This is the kind of role he could do in his sleep. While I have always been a fan, he is slowly becoming a cliche playing the same character over and over again. What is so interesting and entertaining about him is his delivery and interpretation of the lines. It was so refreshing to see him in Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me If You Can"". I just hope that he can do at least one seemingly normal part for every five unemotional violent psychos.Dawson is adequate in her role but so far hasn't forfilled her promise shown in Larry Clark's ""Kids"". She has been starring in safe Hollywood product of late and unfortunately some of them have been disappointing, eg Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Men In Black II"".Ewen Bremner is slightly unintelligible in a quirky comic relief role as a small aircraft pilot. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a blink and you'd miss him cameo.This is an impressive second movie for director Berg. His previous outing ""Very Bad Things"", from his own screenplay, was an extremely black comedy that was slow to begin with but gained momentum and laughs about thirty minutes in. Pacing is still a problem though certainly the comedy is better executed here. The fight scenes are original and technically well handled. The opening sequence is edited with great style and rhythm. It grabs you immediately like the pre-title sequences from the James Bond series. It's unfortunate that for Australian audiences the movie has been retitled ""Welcome To The Jungle"" because the original title, ""The Rundown"", certainly explains why the pre-title sequence is shot and edited in a live gridiron telecast way.The Rock is certainly growing as an actor. No one has taken the place of the muscle bound monosyllabic action stars of the eighties yet. (There has been some pretenders to the throne such as Vin Diesel.) Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme are now being subjected to direct to video movies. I hope the same doesn't happen to The Rock who has more personality of all those hulks combined.",The Rundown

But he plays a very enjoyable character here, and it was fun watching him. He has good screen presence and kept my attention throughout. As always, Christopher Walken was great. Rosario Dawson really looks HOT here, enjoyable dialogue between her and The Rock.Major drawback to the film was Seann William Scott's character, what an empty-headed blabbermouth that just WOULD NOT SHUT UP!

120,jsc173,Move Over Arnold? Or Move Over Harrison?,8,29 September 2003,"It's interesting how Johnson's acting career is taking a track so similar to Arnold's. (By the way, be sure not to miss Arnold's 5-second cameo in the early scenes of the movie.)First, the ""athlete"". Second, the ""barbarian"". And now, a much more likable character with plenty of lines. Johnson has shown that he can dominate the ring as ""The Rock"" and now dominate the screen as ""Beck"".
I went to this movie with my kids, anticipating the usual boring action movie. Surprise! Not only did Dwayne (sorry, I just can't say ""The Rock"") deliver a believable performance as ""Beck"", but the remainder of the cast was, well, appropriately cast. The only ""glitch"" was Rosario Dawson's lame attempt at a Brazilian accent -- not even close!!! And Christopher Walken continues to portray characters that are simultaneously likable, hatable, bizarre, funny and just frickin' strange. I crack up just looking at his face.
The only question now is whether this is a one-off for the character, or whether ""Beck"" will be on-screen again soon. If so, I would hope that Johnson pushes for a character that is more ""Indiana Jones"" than ""Terminator"". See it -- it's a good summer movie, a couple of months late.",The Rundown
121,thomascapital,The Rock is Arnold's successor!!!!!!!!1,10,31 January 2004,"Dwayne Douglas Johnson paired up well with Seann William Scott (AKA Stifler).  The Rock was funny, serious and very entertaining.  He speaks his lines with the experience and elocution of a seasoned stage actor!I wish is that Dwayne Douglas Johnson has a good agent and advisors that can guide him to movie stardom!Best of luck to The Rock!",The Rundown
122,pgwhite95,I'm gonna need your ring.,7,6 January 2009,"I remember going to see this movie, in the theater, not expecting much. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) after all didn't strike me as that decent of actor. Sure, he did the Scorpion King but, that wasn't a far stretch from WWE Raw, all it was, was the Rock flexing his muscles. That was until ""The Rundown"" made it to the big screen.The opening sequence in this film has got to be one of the best hooks in recent movie history. His cool demeanor, confidence, and the persona of a ""closet chef,"" makes this scene awesome. The way he takes out those players is awesome, and I like to see guy's like the Rock, every now and then, kick some Heine.The film doesn't stop being good after the first scene though, Sean Willam Scott is better than I thought too. This is definitely not, American Pie. He actually displays some Lead Roll tendencies and dishes out humor that isn't at the consequence of the scene.The movie moves into the ""jungle"" scene and again, even the extra's do a decent job of acting. Of course, when you have a film like this the speaking parts are not what you want to watch, films like this speak with action, and the little-tike warriors in the jungle deliver with a punch, (or a kick)! All in all, this film is great, and it's one I do not get bored watching over and over. Not exactly a movie you want to watch with your girlfriend but, not one she will think is completely stupid either.",The Rundown
123,keVin-19,Still prefer The Rock laying the smackdown on jabronis,5,2 April 2004,Hmm...it's kinda weird seeing the Rock acting in a movie...cause i'm so used to seeing him wrestling week in and week out...he's way better whooping candy asses out of wrestlers and thrash talking and electrifying the crowd... maybe it's ok if he does a movie once in a while...like the Scorpion King which i feel is not bad....but rundown? and then walking tall? Don't see him going to be a successful action movie star anytime soon...as what he's best at is actually wrestling...and not acting... wish that he'll be back in wrestling soon... i watched the rundown and feel like it's just a B grade movie...nothing too special about this movie... can't smell what the Rock is cookin' anymore ....,The Rundown
124,speedny7,The best of its kind.,10,28 May 2004,"""The Rundown"" is hands-down the best buddy action/comedy ever made.  These types of movies are often hit-or-miss.  ""Midnight Run"" and ""48 Hours"" are great movies of this genre, but ""The Rundown"" surpasses both of them.  The action scenes are incredible, and the dialogue will often make you laugh out loud.  The cinematography in the movie is also pretty awesome. The one thing this movie does is prove to the world that the Rock is a legitamite star, who is capable of making great movies (and a MUCH better actor than Vin Diesel.)  The way that he and Seann William Scott play off each other in this movie is something that all people will be able to appreciate.  And as always, Christopher Walken is awesome. I would recommend that EVERYONE sees this movie.  In my opinion, it was the best action movie to come out in 2003 (barely beating out Kill Bill Vol. 1). Do yourself a favor and see it.",The Rundown
125,bfreilly,Do you like thunderstorms?,8,3 July 2006,"Wow. Movies like this are for me both a big surprise and a guilty pleasure to watch. At first, I was doubtful that the Rock had the screen presence or the acting ability to pull off a movie like this, since I had only known him before as ""the eyebrow guy from wrestling"". This movie proved me wrong and has rapidly moved up into my list of favorite films.Beck (The Rock) is somebody who chases down people that have irritated the mob, be it financially or socially. This is not his job of choice, however; he would rather own a restaurant. His bosses give him one final job: bring Travis (Sean William Scott, in a refreshing departure from the ""horny idiot"" style of movies) back from South America to the States. Beck finds Travis, but immediately runs afoul of Hatcher (Christopher Walken), who owns the mining town Travis lives in and wants something valuable that Travis has been looking for in the jungle. Then there are fights, running around from evil guys, more fights, monkeys, hallucinogenic fruit, and other such entertaining things.Scott brought some well-done comic relief into the film with his quirky upbeat character. I could not stop laughing when Travis really tries to take on Beck in a contest of physical strength. It's like watching a caterpillar try and beat a Mack truck. Christopher Walken, as always, is a pleasure to watch. The man makes a perfect psychopath and I always brighten up when I see him on screen.""The Rundown"" is an excellent film which I would recommend to anyone who loves kinda-brainless (in a good way) action films. Bravo to the Rock. May he have a long and fruitful movie career.",The Rundown

Thank god this film's action scenes don't take any ques from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a good film, but the fighting sucked.  I would say take a look at this movie in the theature and again on video whenever you want to watch something with explotions, witty diaglog, great action scenes, and even the ""Rock"".",The Rundown
127,So_I_watch_movies,Fine little adventure movie. Could have been a lot better,5,14 November 2021,"The rundown is a fine little comedy adventure movie. This definitely would have been a great movie to watch as a kid. As an adult tho I had some problems with it. Most of the humor didn't work for me and although I don't mind stupid jokes here and there, this movie had a lot of unfunny and just plain cheap humor. There are still some jokes that worked though. One involves the Travis character peeing and some funny scenes including monkeys.Also, some of the dialogue was pretty weird and kind of awkward. This whole scene with Christopher Walker talking about the tooth fairy was so unnecessary and unfunny.I did think the movie was directed nicely. I wish the action scenes would have been as nicely shot as the rest of the movie though. There were so many quick cuts in the action scenes that it made my eyes hurt. I counted 5 different shots in just 3 seconds in the 3rd act. Most of the time I had no idea what was going on and who was beating who.I did like that 3rd act tho. It felt fitting to this story and wrapped it up nicely. That is until they go home to Travis's dad. This scene didn't make much sense to me and after, there was this whole dumb scene about Travis doing his weird little thing with his feet to the Rock again. I found the whole Travis character to be annoying and flat and its moments like that that caused me to dislike him.That being said the acting was fine. I specifically liked Christopher Walker in this movie. Even though the villain he portrayed was quite weak and didn't have much to it he made the best out of it.All in all, I would say this is still definitely an enjoyable watch. Probably more for a younger audience tho.I would rate this movie a 5.4/10.",The Rundown
128,moviefan69,Now THIS is how you do an action movie.,8,22 September 2003,"What ever became of the action movie? Here we are, in the age of CGI, wire-fu, slow motion, Hong Kong style CRAP!!! Say what you will, but people like John Woo, and movies like The Matrix, have destroyed the great American action movie. Instead of hard hitting action, we have made to endure ENDLESS slow motion, and laws-of-physics-defying martial arts. They turned the action film into a ballet, and I'm supposed to be impressed? Please. Give me Die Hard over The Matrix any day of the week, and twice on Sunday. Now is The Rundown of the same caliber as Die Hard? Hardly. But as an action movie, it stands head and shoulders above the other movies I mentioned. THIS is an action movie. It's pure 100%, in your face, adrenaline. AND it has actual stuntwork, instead of CG trickery. It makes a difference, and it shows. But another thing this movie has going for it over the Matrix crowd is that it is FUN! The jokes actually work, and work well in the context of the story. The movie never takes itself too seriously. It never tries to be more than what it is, so it doesn't come off as pretentious. (Are you hearing this Wachowski Brothers? Okay, I'm done Matrix bashing.) It's tone is perfect all the way through. Another surprise is actual chemistry between the actors. The Rock has proven to me that he is movie star material. Anyone who has ever watched wrestling knows that the man has charisma to burn, but he has actual acting chops. With just 2 movies, he has shown more action hero potential than say, Steven Seagal or Jean Claude Van Damme, have shown their entire careers. Arnold Schwarzenneger is in the movie for about 2 seconds and tells Rock ""Have Fun"". Much has been said that this is Ah-nold's passing of the torch. Rock is indeed a worthy successor. Trust me. If he picks the right projects, he will be one of THE top box office stars in the world in just a few years' time. As for the rest of the cast, no one really stretches. Seann William Scott and Christopher Walken basically play the same characters you've seen them play before. But that is not a bad thing. Playing these types is what made them popular. BUT what keeps it fresh is the obvious fun they are having. They're not just cashing a paycheck. They know Rock's the star. So they go with it, give it their all, and have a blast. It's that energy that comes through in the movie. Peter Berg last directed the underrated comedy Very Bad Things. I have to give him a lot of credit. I didn't think he'd pull of such great action sequences. Mr. Berg, welcome to the big time. SO in the end what you have is a great cast, great if un-original story, great laughs GREAT laughs, and....FIRST CLASS, GUNS BLAZING, FISTS FLYING, STUFF GETTIN' BLOWED UP REAL GOOD ACTION!!!!!!",The Rundown
129,nettminder,Enjoyable action no-brainer,8,17 April 2004,"I was a little skeptical of this film because of the main star. I sat there hoping it would be better than the low end action movie and I was surprised that it was. I actually enjoyed this film with my family. It had some cool fighting scenes, good humor, and it was a pretty stand up action flick. Maybe I enjoyed it more because I thought it was going to be a stiff, but I give it a strong 8 out of ten for this type of film. Again this was not a thinking man's action movie. I did enjoy it more than the other fare like 'XXX' and other no-brainer action films. Hopefully the Rock will continue to surprise me with Walking Tall and his future movies.

I've never been to either place, but the Scottish accent on Declan is pretty strong.  But then he flies an Irish flag and has a four-leaf clover painted on his plane.  Odd choice I think.Second biggest thing about this movie, why were there so many script holes? The Rock wants to open a restaurant, but why?  He hates guns, and frequently says this, but they never give any reason why?  There are more holes in this plot than in a block of Swiss cheese.  The digital effects are cheesy and obvious.This movie has its funny moments, but for me they were few and far between. This movie has all action and no plot.

It had probably one of the best crash scenes ever and some great fight scenes as well. The chemistry between The Rock and Sean Scott was very good and Christopher Walkin was everything you would expect him to be. I have watched the film 4-5 times and enjoy it every time I see it. I think it is a great film for just sitting back and laughing. In the film The Rock plays a bounty hunter for lack of a better word for a bookie. He starts out hunting down this football player and has to take on the massive O'Line of this star player. I found this fight scene particularly enjoyable, though the best fight scene takes place in the jungle. It is unbelievable how intense it is. Guys are flying from everywhere out of the trees. You got to see this movie if you like fun!",The Rundown
133,neal2zod,Criminally underseen,10,22 March 2005,"This nearly flawless action buddy movie somehow managed to open big then disappear from theaters, implying bad word-of-mouth or just a bad movie. Which is shocking since everyone I know LOVES this movie, even women and people who hate action movies. I suspect it'll be a cable TV favorite someday.The big story here is The Rock - his performance is simply a revelation. I've always been a fan since his WWF days, so you can imagine how sorely disappointed I was with the disastrous The Scorpion King. Why cast the most charismatic in-ring superstar (sorry, Hogan and Austin) of all time in a monosyllabic grunting role The Undertaker would probably turn down? The Rock's over-the-top in-ring persona (the $500 shirts, the People's Eyebrow, referring to himself in 3rd person, etc..) seemed custom made for a Pootie Tang-esque comedy vehicle, so imagine my surprise at the depth and subtlety of his work in this one.The Rock's performance melds the best of John McClane from Die Hard and William Munny from Unforgiven - he's a man able to keep a sense of humor, but also a tired, quiet man who's seen too many things and been through too many situations he'd like to forget. What could have been a blend of two clichés works smashingly well. Just watch any of his early scenes with Sean William Scott - The Rock delivers every one of his lines as if he's had to say it to some chump 20 times before; he answers every question as if he's been asked it a million times. There's so many unanswered questions, so much mystery surrounding his character (check out the tattoo on his arm), that his lack of character development actually works as character development (see the guys in Predator if you don't see what I mean). It's truly a great, surprising performance.The film actually isn't totally successful. Rosario Dawson is under-used, Walken appears to be sleepwalking (he actually showed more fire in his cameo in Gigli than he does here), and the 2nd half isn't quite as good as the first - there's an Indiana Jones-esque sequence that feels entirely out of place and obvious edits to the final battle scene (watch the DVD deleted scenes for that).But overall, this is a crowd-pleaser, pure and simple. Funnier than most alleged comedies these days, great over-the-top action sequences, and a star-making performance by The Rock make this one of my all time personal favorites.",The Rundown

And so, I give it a 6, for the decent action sequences and the performances the artists have rendered. The audience will definitely enjoy the emotion that it carries till the end. But, it has failed in fulfilling the audience expectations. All over the movie, the audience will have a sort of disappointment like, it could have been much better.Obviously, The Rock does perform well, both on and off the screen in action sequences. But, the Director has failed in providing proper validity for many scenes, that the movie was built on. They were not explained properly in their importance related to the concept of the movie.All over, the movie promises you, an adventurous ride, astounding action sequences, promising performance by Rock in action sequences, a good humor and a good fun time.

137,joepublic,The Rockdown *spoilers*,4,11 April 2004,"Make no mistake about it this is a movie specifically designed to position Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson into the unclaimed action hero position left by Arnie and Sly, in what seems like, a million years ago.The producers of this movie have played a safe hand, surrounding The Rock with good actors (Christopher Walken), up and coming actors (Rosario Dawson) and a sidekick with a track record of comedy hits (Stifler).It is also stuffed with a more physical style of action geared around Rocky's undeniable abilities. Gone are Sly and Arnies heavy gun fire (well until the end anyway) and in its place sequences that focus more on Johnson's pro-wrestling skills (there is even a Rock Bottom in there) all of which are filmed and edited at a fast pace. The Rock is likeable as Beck, a man who wants to put his violent past behind him by doing one final job for his boss, despite his cliched motivations.With so many elements in place why then does this movie feel like there is something missing? Well some of it is down to The Rock himself. When he is called upon to portray the character elements most like his wrestling persona then he is nothing less than a charismatic screen presence. His put downs and self-depricating humor are right out of The Brama Bull's play book and make a positive impact. But when he is called on to act, to portray the serious story elements then he is less convincing. This should be quantified by the fact that he is no worse than any of his peers within the genre so I wounder if he will improve or indeed if he will have to improve. I doubt it.The Rock is not the only one to blame. His patter with Williamson is funny at first but Williamsons continual reference back to his most famous role not only wears thin quickly but makes him appear to be one of the laziest actors currently at work (at least he isn't Ashton Kutcher).Dawson and Walken are fine in their limited roles but you leave wishing they had more screen time. You get the feeling that if Dawson had been playing a version of the sidekick role the movie would have improved greatly as she has reasonable chemistry with Johnson.The direction and editing also do the film no favors. Many action film makers seem to believe that rapid editing and an overuse of slow motion add drama and excitement but in this case (as with most others) it becomes distracting and ultimatley irritating when The Rock has enough physicality to carry the preceedings without resorting to techincal trickery.The Rundown is slightly more enjoyable than most action movies because of The Rock but it also highlites his shortcomings. Perhaps the best move for Johnson would be to prove he can seriously act (or should that be act seriously) because it will only help him secure himself as the number one action star in the U.S. The Rundown seems to be a tentative first step.2/5",The Rundown

""American Pie"" is a franchise and all, but geez, even Ashton Kutcher stopped playing Kelso in ""Butterfly Effect"".That said, Stiffler worked here.As you might imagine, the premise of the film is contrived, and the plot struggles to keep it plausible.

They pronounced the words correctly but it is obvious they are not from Brazil because of the accent. They could have used Brazilian actors to play the Brazilian roles.

On the other hand, Rosario Dawson is someone I'd like to see given some challenging roles.  A movie with The Rock and her teamed-up (less Mr. Scott) could be enjoyable. A couple of comments I noticed about this movie that Director Peter Berg should consider next time he does an action movie.  1) If someone the size of The Rock hits someone the size of Seann Scott several times in the face over a 24hr period, let's see some swelling and at least a black eye; 2) If a person falls several hundred feet down a steep incline, tumbling the entire way, let's see more than couple of scratches when they hit the bottom.",The Rundown

Beyond that he has unusually strong comic timing and a gift for delivery that one can only assume was honed in the bizarre theater that is professional wrestling.In this film he is joined by, Seann William Scott, the latest in a seemingly endless line of thrice-named teen idols. Scott already has something of a successful track record as the comic foil having earned some legitimate belly laughs in 'Dude, Where's My Car' as well as the 'American Pie' series. He does the best he can with a thinner comic script than he might be accustom to, but his charm comes through nonetheless.The cast is rounded out by the very sexy and talented Rosario Dawson, as well as the legendary Christopher Walken...a man so creepy in real life that his role as the villain is sublimely convincing.What director Peter Berg gives us is a buddy picture a very traditional blend of fight scenes and one liners, not to mention an ending that you could guess without the benefit of a frontal lobe.

Is the chemistry between The Rock and Sean Patrick etc good? Yes. Overall I really enjoyed this film.  It did not change my outlook life but it did improve my mood that night. And as far as  I can see The Rock has stepped in to replace my other favorite action hero, Arnold.",The Rundown
149,Ulriktheslayer,Good flick.,7,7 October 2003,"Good casting, but a little disappointed in Christopher Walkens character, The Rocks timing and execution was good tho he could back off on the wrestling moves (it's a movie not the WWE). Seann William Scott was pretty good, but should have done some more action like in Bullet Proof Monk.",The Rundown
150,tgitm,Indy Jones + Midnight Run + Jackie Chan stunts = The Rundown.,8,5 October 2003,"This really is a classic funny buddy movie (Odd Couple, Shanghai Noon), with Indiana Jones action, the plot from Midnight Run,  and EXCELLENT Jackie Chan style fights and stuntwork. This movie is a good action movie..Old school style Very little use of Character CGI in the fighting sequences (or if they did I didn't see it..) It looks like they went the extra mile on some of the creature (monkey) effects too...I would rather see a puppet than a cartoon.  The Rock is actually a good actor, and he really has fallen into the action hero slot that Ahnold has left.. (watch for a cameo and listen to the line), that Vin Diesel and others are desperately failing to meet. Seann Scott looks better and has refined his acting skills as well.. his lines sound way less forced and original. The action scenes (except for the first) are all OUTSIDE in the open with plenty of light.. There are no crappy editing flaws to hide bad fight sequences. And to top it all off, it features Chris Walken as a Villain Think Max Zorin with some age on him... They even almost reproduced the mining footage in Powaqqatsi... So if you are into Original REAL (not crappy Matrix 2 cgi) fight scenes, with the same old feeling of a buddy movie check it out.",The Rundown
151,FilmFanatic14,Great Fun,9,10 January 2004,"If you are looking for great entertainment, brainless laughter and a whole heap of fun, this is the movie for you!

Great movie to see with the whole family, adults and children will enjoy!  9/10",The Rundown
152,gillard_stephen,"Good, really quite good, surprisingly.",8,1 March 2005,"Well first of the bat this is not a film with amazing brains. However what it is, is fun. Really good fun. The Rock and Scott make a good team for this comedy action buddy movie. With Christopher Walken putting in a good turn as the sort of semi-likable bad guy and some slightly darker moments slipped in there is a deeper plot lurking beneath the high action quota. Thankfully the Rock doesn't take himself too seriously and is prepared to make some fun of the tough guy Wrestler image he has built up. Not all films with Wrestlers in need to be a Hulk Hogan train wreck. Scott also moves a step or two away from his Stiffler character and you can actually care for his characters plight from time to time. Overall enjoyable fun for action fans, Rock fans and anyone else...surprisingly.",The Rundown
153,thekingster,B+ Flick...mindless entertainment,6,16 October 2005,"This movie will appeal to all who like action for the sake of action. ""The Rock"" does a moderate job of acting in this movie-but his performance would not win him any awards. I love the fight scene in the beginning against the football team. Overrated and improbable: of course...but it really appeals to the thrill seeker in me for some reason.Sean William Scott plays off The Rock's character very well. I was disappointed with his performances in American Pie/Wedding. I thought he was a foul-mouthed, obviously stereotyped actor. I was pleasantly surprised at his different acting ability in this movie.This movie is a B+ flick with good fight scenes and low budget story lines. Good for mindless entertainment.",The Rundown
154,twizzle777,Props to Peter Berg,8,1 October 2003,"For a second film The Rundown is quite an accomplished little movie for the director.  Not only does Berg use some interesting editing and F/X shots but he actually did a great job with the action and martial arts, perhaps the most difficult stuff to tackle in cinema from a technical standpoint.  But he delivered the goods, the impact of bodies on each other and various bit of jungle was very tangible.The story and characters are nothing new, but the performances make them enjoyable, and though the humor is juvenile, it really does add to sheer ecstatic nature of the movie.  I left the theatre shocked that ""The Rundown"" (I prefer Helldorado) was some of the most fun I had at a theatre this summer.",The Rundown
155,fserafim,"Oh my god, what a terrible movie!!!",1,23 November 2006,"I can't believe that someone can enjoy this piece of garbage. The plot of the film is so ridiculous, that even make you laugh. Come on!!! Christopher W. with thousands of Brazilian slaves digging a hole of the size of the meteor in the middle of the ""Brazilian jungle"" looking for gold??? Come on!!! Perhaps the director of the film thought there is no government in Brazil and anyone can open a gigantic hole in the middle of Amazonia. So what are we waiting for? Lets grab our shovels, lets fly to Brazil, enslave some Brazilian people and get rich!!! The Rock is sent there to find little's daddy boy, the character played by Sean W. S., who goes away to Brazil. The Rock is a cool guy, but guess what happen when he has to play hard? Yes, that's right. He punches and kick and beat everybody else's butt. And how about Sean W. S. with that phony accent trying to speak CAT in Portuguese (GATO), it is so ridiculous. In the film he is looking for the lost treasure called the GATO do DIABO, or Devil's Cat in English, ooooh spoooky!!! Who does he think he is? Indiana Jones? But in my opinion the most stupid part of the movie is when they meet a revolutionary group in the jungle. (Where are they, Colombia?) And guess what. The leader of this group is a ""Brazilian"" who speaks Portuguese worst than Sean W. S. and looks just like a Vietnamese. It is unbelievable. (They probably run out budget digging the big hole for the film and had no money to hire a real Brazilian person who could speak Portuguese) But wait. There is more. He is a super ""capoeira"" fighter. And he and some mates of the group challenge The Rock to a fight. Looking like monkeys, the capoeira fighters use vine around their hip, and keep jumping and climbing from the trees to kick the Rock. So the Rock kick their asses and being a great fighter, they become friends. The Vietnamese guy says that the Rock reminds him of Muhamed Ali(what? it must be because we don't know if the Rock is black or white). Well. The rest of the story you already know. The Rock and Sean W. S. become friend, find the GATO do DIADO, save the girl, and beat the evil Christopher Walkin.",The Rundown
156,alainvirgin,Slick and Stylish,8,2 October 2003,"The Rundown is an above average movie which operates under it's own physics, and is quite fun.  One must understand that when they watch this movie a different set of consistant rules apply to the action than they would in a movie attempting to be true to life.  With this understood one can appreciate the energetic, humourous, and inventive nature of the film. All of the performances are quite passable, with Walken being ingenious in his delivery.  The camera is devoted to the senses of the viewer which makes for a visually appealing film with fantastic editing.  There are some effects which could have been done better (coughgreenscreencough) but it is still worth a watch.",The Rundown
157,NawlimitSoulja,"Great movie, Rock is becoming a great actor",8,27 September 2003,"This is a non-stop fun movie.  It's a mixture of Shanghai Noon, Bad Boys, and Rush Hour but only funnier.  The Rock is an awesome action hero and will certainly become the newest celebrated actor in hollywood for the next few months since everybody in the movie did a great job.  Christopher Walken is not only a scene stealer, but everybody meshes well in the movie that makes it believable.  Also Sean William Scott picked the right movie to get back into the action business after a let down in Bulletproof Monk.  He picked the right movie to step away from the pure comedy movies and gross out movies.",The Rundown
158,brotherbabyface,great run at an old formula,8,30 December 2003,"although there are no surprises in the storyline of the Rundown, there is some great action and unexpected humor in this movie.  it is well-filmed, with very good action sequences, and the Rock does an unbelievable job; far surpassing the low expectations i had after the disappointing Scorpion King. he is charismatic, dynamic, and all-around perfect for this kind of fast-paced, action fest.  his face is animated, he has wonderful timing and presence, and unlike most actors in this type of film, he actually ACTS! Walken is a great villain, slick and cool, and his henchman are appropriately vapid and mean.  the girl and the fights are both hot, and even Sean William Scott is less annoying than usual, although he gives us little more than Stiffler of the Jungle.  all-in-all, a great action movie and a tremendous splash for the Rock.",The Rundown

160,kluhyarg,One time watch,5,28 February 2015,"The movie is watchable, but not worth a second time in my opinion.My main problem with the movie is Travis (played by Seann William Scott), he is very annoying which made me wish he was punched by The Rock every time he says or does anything...Dwayne Johnson is great in the movie, the only problem I have is that there is little explanation about why he does not uses weapons. Christopher Walken is good as always, but didn't do much in the movie. The rest is okay, except by the supposed Brazilian people in the movie not played by Brazilian actors, but this will only be noticed by Brazilian people.The action is okay if you don't mind some unrealistic moves, the jokes are week for the most part and the story is okay but the end makes no sense to me.",The Rundown

The plot makes no sense, but the film is fast and fun. Beck heads to the jungle to search for Travis (Scott) only to run into a tangled web of big guns, Walken's Hatch, dangerous women, Dawson's Mariana, and Travis, who is more than meets the eye. Everyone is conning everyone. No one trusts anyone. And every is in trouble up to their necks. Scott has great comic timing and is a terrific foil to The Rock's sullen dry wit. Dawson plays a mean sexy and Walken. Well, Walken is typical Walken. Good enough. It's a fun ride.",The Rundown

The Rock and Seann William Scott were perfect together. They both provided comedic relief and could kick some butt!! The only thing I found distracting was Rosario Dawson's terrible fake accent. It was very off-putting, but I have learned to live with it. I love everything about this movie otherwise, and Christopher Walken plays a great villain!! It also contains some great one-liners...""Santa Claus doesn't give any breaks!"" ""I'll give ya two choices...option a...option b, I make you.""

I love this kind of movie, however, there was one thing on this particular movie that was just awful!! The people speaking Portuguese! what the hell was that?? come on!! If the movie is supposed to take place in Brazil, how come none of the supposed Brazilians can speak a word in Portuguese?? Why didn't they use any Brazilian actors instead of trying to teach Portuguese to Americans in 5 minutes?? (it was that bad). I don't mind that the movie shows Brazil like it is just a big jungle with stupid people, really... I know it's fiction, and it works in the context of the film, but that accent is just unforgivable... I mean, if they are all Brazilian, how come their English is perfect while their Portuguese sucks? shouldn't it be the opposite?? But I am aware that this HUGE flaw is not noticeable outside Brazil, so this movie must be much, much better for people who don't speak Portuguese. After all the rest of the movie is really cool...",The Rundown
165,imac_1969,Best movie I've seen in a while,9,14 August 2006,"Awesome guy movie! Nice to see a movie that relies on fighting skill, not blood and gore of guns. Violence is mild, compared to a lot of today's movies. Language is somewhat crude, but not uncomfortable. Ladies may also enjoy due to lack of clothing on Seann Wiliiam Scott and the Rock in some scenes. The Rock's history with wrestling is well used as he does a lot of his own fighting and stunts. His double (shown in DVD extras) is hard to pick out, a good sign in an action movie. Seann does a good job not being Stiffler, but he still has that cocky jackass thing going for him. Rosario Dawson does a good job in her role as the only female in the movie. Christopher Walken is his usual creepy bad guy - a good villain. Subtitles may be needed in some places (I sure did) such as understanding the small plane pilot. DVD extras show how much fun these guys had making the movie - and they are so hot! Can't wait for another movie with the Rock like this one.",The Rundown

First, We meet Beck(the Rock) a specialist retriever/Chef that wants to open his own restaurant. But his last mission is on the hot jungle of Amazon. well the things that we Brazilian always see on Americans movies about Brazil is that there's a lot of confusion on whats Brazil, whats Mexico and whats Cuba. But this movie by far presents the more accurate design for a Brazilian bar so far.

169,Giseisha,An excellent introduction to The Rock!!!,8,10 October 2003,"I must say that I was very suprised after watching The Rundown.  The rock gives an excellent portrayal of Beck, an collection agent looking for a way out.  His lines are well-read, his action movie comedic timing is dead-on, and his fight scenes and stunt work are very impressive.  Christopher Walkem plays an excellent bad-guy, and Stifler, as always, is along for the ride. All in all, I highly recommend this movie, because I have a feeling that someday, this will be where it all started for The Rock. 8/10",The Rundown

I thought this might be a fun diversion, but instead, it was painful boredom.If The Rock wants to be an action star, he needs to take find a better director than Peter Berg. The biggest problem with this movie's numerous action sequences is that you can't see them. Lots of tight close-ups and bone-crunching sounds, but I never really got the sense that The Rock could really beat up half of these people. Where are the moves? Seann William Scott is normally a funny guy. Here, the screenwriter(s) didn't figure out what to do with him, so he alternates in motives and personality on a regular basis. Christopher Walken has a few bits of humour, but it only makes you wonder if the paycheck was really worth his precious time for this one.The best thing about this entire movie is the cameo in the first scene.

Beck must go to Brazil to recover mobster Billy Walker's son in order to pay back a debt. Nothing special, interesting or incredibly unique about the plot. One would be deemed as correct for describing the movie (which IMDb describes to be as an 'Action/Adventurous/Comedy' flick) as a waste of time, money and effort.Johnson struts around in a tough guy attitude as Beck. After the first 10 minutes, this gets very annoying and you just want to break the television set. The acting was dreadful; you would think that Dwayne Johnson was in another episode of Raw. I thought they would at least make the stunts satisfactory but alas, you can see all the cords holding up Johnson and you wander how they ever made any money from this film.For the reason that Dwayne Johnson and friends can't act, the plot being something a five-year-old dreamed up and the fact that we are in the 21st century and the special effects look very medieval, ""The Rundown"" has shamefully earned itself a 1/10 in deed.Poor effort, don't even think about doing a sequel, and may this be a lesson to never trust professional wrestlers on screen.",The Rundown
178,terryr00,movie theater version much better than video,7,20 July 2004,"The theater movie had one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in a movie. When the video came out we were extremely disappointed. That scene (when they were drugged and sitting/laying around the fire and the monkeys started to come into the camp) was edited down so far that the impact barely made me smile. Hollywood blew that one; they complain about places editing ""artistic"" intent (crap) out of movies, and then butcher that scene, that is ironic. The rock actually showed promise of acting too bad his best scene was scrubbed. The action scenes are like most now days (not realistic but entertaining). The dialog was pretty good, especially the last scene. The last minute of the show was one of the best endings of a movie I have seen in a long time. If the writers of this movie will make more, where some thought goes into some of the lines would be good. The director still needs some help in being a little more realistic and less entertaining. Overall I enjoyed this show and will watch it again.",The Rundown

Also, the cut-aways and all of the other components of the cinematography were awesome. I think that there should be a sequel if the filmmakers are able to reproduce all of the comedy and action without spoiling it. Oh yeah, also Sean William Scott, The Rock, Christopher Walken, and Rosario Dawson were all terrific. And Christopher Walken, you specifically get serious respect from me on this one, as always. I was very impressed with The Rock's acting in this movie. And it wasn't too touchy either. I do wish that we could've known the characters' backgrounds more thoroughly, though. Maybe in the sequel, they will explain everyone's pasts in detail. Also, because of the extra-quick cut- aways, the action scenes are really cool, and the mistakes in continuity that would normally be obvious, are not easy to see at all. Great movie!

There were a lot of action sequences that really pulls you into the story and keeps you interested. For the rock, thus far, I would say that this is his greatest accomplishment to date as an actor. He conforms not only to the action, but to the personal scenes with dialogue to the utmost. He appears comfortable in character in all ways. One would see his persona and not even think of him as an individual during his scenes.I highly recommend this to folks that get into action movies. If you like intense situations, then this is the movie for you. I enjoyed the fact that through most of the movie, Beck was mostly physical.

It rubs elbows with such stellar productions as: The Pallbearer with David Schwimmer and Gwyneth Paltrow; Vampire in Brooklyn with Eddie Murphy; The Postman with Kevin Costner; and Beverly Hills Ninja with Chris Farley. It has gently nudged Medicine Man starring Sean Connery from these prestigious ranks. Congratulations, Mr. The Rock -- you suck with the best.R. J. Stewart (whose resume I will include below), blatantly, blatantly stole from other Hollywood films to cobble together his shoddy script. Romancing the Stone. Indiana Jones. Apocalypse Now (they actually made Christopher Walken use the phrase ""Heart of Darkness"" in a speech to the ""backwards natives""). Not to mention The Three Amigos (Walken as El Guapo).

There is however one thing I am compelled to comment on: I didn't like that the 'rebels' weren't native speakers. I am sure it doesn't matter to those who don't know Portuguese, but people like me, whose mother tongue is Portuguese, will feel quite put off by the way the supposedly Brazilian rebel speaks, striving to articulate every word in between natural pauses of a non-native and with a very, very evident accent. He didn't do much better than the American who spoke a few words. I am sure the filmmakers wouldn't have had that much trouble finding actual Brazilian actors with those 'capoeira' skills.

After all Vin Diesel can't do them all. His timing was up to par and in some of the films more tense moments he really shines, I could feel the emotion of his his character ""Beck"". Seann William Scott delivers a good performance as well, far from his ""stiffler"" gimmick in past films. The two play off eachother very well, giving us some of the more humorous moments in the film.Mr. Walken is absolutly wonderful..very cocky and very fun to watch.

189,ravedragons,A must-see action packed entertainer,10,30 August 2008,"When i went to see this movie, i had read no reviews or had no expectations for it.All i knew was that it was the second movie in which the rock was doing the lead role.The movie that i got to see was an action packed commercial entertainer which can easily be liked even by the most choosy movie watchers.I'm not a big fan of the rock and i didn't have to be in order to watch this movie.The stunts and action sequences in the movie are very satisfying.The editing and camera work are great and the story is also interesting.Apart from all this,i think this movie is worth spending your money and time.The movie itself is so good that it would have done well even with different actors who don't suit the movie at all.The rock aka Dwayne really suits the character that he plays.The fights by rock in the movie are excellent.Seann William Scott fills in for the funny side of the film and provides a few laughs. The pairing of Seann and the rock is the best thing in the film. They are suited for each other in these types of roles.This really adds to the success of the film.This film is a treat to action movie fans and it is a racy entertainer for others. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this film must be a very dull person.....",The Rundown
190,poke12,Ok-here's the Rundown,6,24 March 2004,"I anticipated the release of The Rundown for quite a while now, and purchased it this evening. I finished watching the movie and was left with some questions, compliments, and regrets.Questions: Why did the director hold back on the Rock. Yes, he is not a huge motion picture super star (yet), and I agree he should not be allowed to run wild on the screen, but man, he has such charisma, and the director did not do him ANY favours by making ""Beck"" rather unidimensional in personality. Where was the swearing, where was some genuine anger?  Surely a mob boss' hitman can use some dirty language. I'm not a large advocate of excessive vulgarity...but c'mon! The movie lacked in this area. There was a lot of anger from a lot of people in this movie, and words like ""pee"" and ""ding dong"" and ""move it"" were quite lacking in delivery!Secondly. What the hell type of music was that?  The score was terrible, and did nothing for the anticipation of poignant plot moments. During (what could've been) a potent chase where the ""good guys"" were running from the bad guys, there was elevator type music---terrible!Compliments: Great cinematography. I have a 52 inch widescreen television and had I not, I may not have enjoyed this movie that much! Thank goodness for not too-much comic relief. I am a proponent of practical dialogue during the depicted scenes on the screen, and thankfully your funny bone won't be tickled too-much...rather, just enough. Very well done. If you don't understand what I am speaking of think of watching a watching horror movie where all they do is kill, and tell jokes...not appropriate.Killer Arnold cameo.No useless sex scene.The Rock can act...however, he must work on his emotional-dialogue emphasis...as in intonation and delivery!Regrets - I wish Christopher Walken were more involved. Like every performance, he is solid. It seems that he is always on the screen for 15 seconds shorter than you want him to be. Sometimes, it can work to the movies disadvantage though. The scene may cut from a huge action shot, then to calm Cool Christopher...and right when you set into what he is saying...he's gone but for some this may be a positive. He has one of his usual killer monologues!This is definately a movie that one can watch a couple of times...and you should. This movie won't win any Globes/Oscars, but it is undeniably worth the money if not soley for its entertainment.6.5/10",The Rundown
191,sarahew88,Durrr Rock!,7,5 March 2011,"You can get this movie for 2 bucks on Amazon and enjoy Dwayne Johnson in a silly no-thought-needed movie. It is a lot less painful than reading a 15 paragraph review dissecting a stupid non Oscar winning movie. Ten lines? Seriously? I cant post a pain less review of a movie unless I bore the reader to tears with ten or more lines? Wow. So to make ten lines at least, it must prompt movie review wannabees to diatribe on and on and on and on about silly low budget movies. No doubt this movie would appeal to 14 yr old boys, so lets forgo the 15 paragraph stories. The reviews last a lot longer than the actual movie. ta da!!! finished!",The Rundown
192,forallyourhamsterneeds,This film is only slightly above average,6,7 October 2003,"There are alot of bad movies out there. One of them is called The Scorpion King. It, like The Rundown, also stars Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson. However there are a hundred reasons why the Rundown is a better movie than the Scorpion King. I don't have room for them all here, but lets just say that The Rock can actually act (not well, mind you, and I doubt he will be good for more than a few character types), but he actually earns some of his no doubt ridiculously large salary for this one.It's a buddy action flick. If you don't have a soft spot for buddy action flicks like I do, then you won't like this movie. On the other hand if buddy actions flicks (aka Bad Boys, Tango and Cash, Rush Hour, etc) are your favorite type of film, you will almost definately like this movie. The Rock and Seann William Scott might seem like an unlikely pair, but they have on screen chemistry which develops throughout the film.As a comedy, this film is somewhat lacking, however there are several funny moments.In summary, go see this movie in theatres because action is cooler on the big screen, and if you can't afford two movies you can always rent School of Rock on video later.",The Rundown
193,buttnuggler,action and insanity,9,2 October 2003,"What a fun movie. A good mix of action and comedy with only a few moments of slow paced banter only to be outdone with ridiculous remarks from the always odd Walken.  Couldn't complain about the plot the acting or the action, only that me and my girlfriend were the only ones in the theater to see it.",The Rundown
194,ukgirl1n2007,Best Movie I've seen in a long time,10,28 September 2003,"This movie is action packed, and very funny! I've seen it twice already and want to see it again. Everyone in the theater laughed so hard during the majority of the movie. Scott and the Rock are a great duo. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end. This is one defintely worth your time, and your money! I highly recommend it!",The Rundown
195,venscoso,Changing of the guard?,7,15 September 2003,"So I saw this thing at a pre-release showing while I was visiting a friend in LA.  Basically, I'd never have paid to see a movie with The Rock and Sean William Scott.  But this was free, so my friend and I went.  Suffice to say, I was very surprised at how well it turned out.  Sure, it's an unrealistic action movie.  But the plot's interesting.  You hate the bad guy.  You like the good guy.  And some guys you can't tell whether they're bad or good (always a nice thing for an action movie).  Plot twists are fun and not entirely predictable (though not out-of-nowhere either).  And the end result was a very fun, entertaining movie.If you want to know a little bit more, The Rock is basically a bad-ass. He's a ""collection man"" for some rich dude in LA, and has sworn off guns, which means he kicks a lot of butt with just his brawn.  Anyway, he has to travel to the Amazon to kidnap the rich dude's son, who's trying to be Indiana Jones.  Obviously, it's not as easy as he anticipated, and ends up going on an Amazonian adventure chasing someone who's both chasing treasure himself and being chased by the bad guys.  The action scenes all kick butt too (while at times they're a bit overblown, but who doesn't like that in a good action movie).  They're quite inventive, including my favorite one where The Rock gets tooled by some Amazon natives.To sum up, Sean William Scott will never be the next Indiana Jones, though he did prove himself as great comedic relief.  But the Rock may have earned the title of Arnold's successor as a ripped action hero who can mix things up a bit.",The Rundown
196,Mustiado,"The Rock, in what The Scorpion King was supposed to be...",9,27 September 2003,"I have to say that this movie was quite possibly the best one I've seen since the school year started.  First, The Rock has made leaps and bounds as an actor.  Beck was a believable character with real human behavior, which made Rock fun to watch on screen.  Rosario Dawson was excellent as the femme fatale of the movie, and while I don't consider Sean William Scott to be the strongest actor, he has his moments.  What truly makes the movie is FINALLY seeing Christopher Walken as a bad guy again.  No one plays a villain like Walken does, which sets up both The Rock and the plot, making this one of the best movies I've seen all year.",The Rundown
197,dewy7,i walked out on this dud!!!!!!!!!!,1,27 September 2003,I would like to say that who ever the director was they should quit the film making business. Bad lighting and bad camera angles.the music score didn't seem to fit the movie either.  the actors looked stupid saying their bad lines as well.two words  WALK AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The Rundown
198,extrajoss,"top action flick, pushed all the right buttons. The Rock is the next Arnie.",10,5 January 2004,"This was simply the most fun I've had in a cinema in a long time. The Rock is one of the few action stars that can actually act. And while Sean William Scott is a little annoying, the fight scenes are fantastic and the monkey scene had me in stitches. And while I'll be the first to admit, it is it no intellectual masterpiece, its a fantastic piece of mindless fun.9/10",The Rundown
199,redfoot34,A solid action/comedy,8,27 September 2003,The Rock is a star plain and simple as is the already established Seann William Scott.  The story is average but the Rock's character carries the film.  Its fun and a great crowded theater movie. For action fans that enjoyed movies like 48 hours and Rush Hour this film is for you.  If your looking for Oscar like performances why are you watching an action movie in the first place.  Oh and Christopher Walken steals some scenes as well.,The Rundown
200,rjones2992,Totally Awesome!,10,26 September 2003,I saw the movie today. Since I am afraid I might spoil it for others just please go see it. The movie is just an all around great movie.

Vin Desiel has come and gone, but Dwayne Johnson is here to stay!Sean William Scott is his usual funny self, and his partnership with Dwayne Johnson's character creates an interesting and funny interaction.Personally, I could not stop laughing throughout the whole movie, and the action sequences are second to none!Great movie! 10 out of 10 in my book.",The Rundown

207,Rokuzen,The Lowdown on the Rundown,8,5 October 2003,"The Synopsis:In this Adventure/Comedy, a loan enforcer (The Rock) is sent to Brazil to track down his boss' maverick archaeologist son (Seann William Scott), who has gotten mixed up in the gold mining town-that-time-evicted of EL Dorado, which is owned by the ever evil/eccentric Christopher Walken. Throw in some rebels (including a washed up Ernie Reyes Jr.) and a few monkeys, simmer and serve (you'll get that if you go see the film).The Execution:Not having seen the Scorpion King, I was not sure what to expect with The Rock in the lead. I was pleasantly surprised - they guy can act. Granted it's not Shakespeare, but The Rock was able to pull off a good performance. He can do the dramatic bits, as well as the comedic facial and verbal beats (a good example would be the `I hebt monkeebs' scene a little more than halfway through the movie).Walken was good as the low-key madman. However, I felt they could have done a little more with him, since he is the villain after all.Seann William Scott was great as Travis. He definitely plays a good loon who's been in the jungle too long, and I hope to see him in more stuff. (Yes I know he's been in the American Pie movies, but I've not seen them and really don't care too. though I might now just to see what else this boy can do).The story was well rounded for a WWE vehicle (Mr. McMahon was the producer). The plot made sense, and the jokes were well played (including inside ones like Walken asking `What am I, psychic?' as seen on most trailers). No odd tangents were added and no loose ends were left (aside from the obligatory leave-it-vaguely-open-for-possible-sequel ending). Indeed, not a mindless action flick. Speaking of which.Now on the fight scenes: As to be expected with a film starring a pro-wrestler, the fights were over the top. but in a good way. They all were well choreographed. The Rock's character is averse to guns, so the bulk of the fights are dodging bullets and disarming his assailants `peacefully,' using actual martial arts with only the occasional suplex and drop kick. However, he'll shoot you if need be.The Verdict:There are many reasons to go see this movie - It's fun for one. The camera work was good and the scenery was beautiful. The Rock can indeed act. There's a Scotsman pilot/preacher who thinks he's Irish (or an Irish preacher/pilot wanting to be a Scotsman). You'll need to see it to figure out some references from this review. And most important you'll need to see it because of the score:For being what it is, for not taking itself too seriously (the intro proves that right off the bat), for knowing it's an adventure/comedy and living up to that notion extremely well -I give The Rundown a 6 out of 6 on the New World Otter's arbitrary scale of stuff and things.  Suspend your disbelief and go see it soon.",The Rundown
208,gst2000,Not bad but Midnight Run so much better,6,30 September 2015,"I read somewhere that this was a spiritual remake of Midnight Run which is one of my favourite films...any fans of Midnight Run DO NOT FALL INTO THE SAME TRAP! Some bits are directly ripped from Midnight Run (from memory the start is incredibly similar), but the rest of the film is completely different, as is the humour. I found myself snigering a couple of times, usually due to the excellent Christopher Walken, but other than that the comedy fell short for me...and what was that awful Scottish accent of the pilot? Initially I thought he was Irish...then there were bagpipes and the penny dropped he was supposed to be Scottish.Maybe it's just me (being from the UK - something lost in translation?), but I found some of the 'slapstick' too OTT (rolling down the cliff being a good example) also things like 100's bullets being fired and all hitting the ground near feet (worst aiming in history). I found the comedy a bit too childish at times (toilet jokes)...but maybe the age rating had something to do with it? Anyway, overall the film was OK maybe I went in with my expectations too high (although I was aware this film wasn't as good) - not bad but anyone thinking of watching this needs to know Midnight Run is a substantially better film.",The Rundown

210,kckehoe,Fascination With The Rock?,3,2 April 2004,"I was amazed to come on here and find all of these great reviews of this film. What movie are you guys watching?* Atrocious Character Development * This film has some of the weakest character development I have ever seen. Why should I even care about 'The Rock's"" character? The only thing they let us know about him is that he likes to cook and wants to open a restaurant, are you joking?! No, before you know it Beck is in the Amazon trying to find another character (Sean William Scott) we are supposed to like but know absolutely nothing about. Why do I even care if beck even saves this guys Life? I won't even go into detail about the Villain (Christopher Walken) or the Rebel leader because they are both treated in this same manner.* Where is the Plot? * So, you are trying to tell me that an evil gold mining lord who speaks no Portuguese has enslaved a whole village of people into mining the gold for him. Ok, but wait then the plot jumps to finding this ancient gold statue (no relation to the evil mining of gold mention before). Then we have this rebel resistance which we know nothing about. Who are these people? We can only assume that these people don't want to mine the gold for Christopher Walken so they live in the jungle. Big deal.* Action Fight Scenes * I would forgive this films Character and Plot flaws if the fight scenes weren't so boring. They are very repetitive and boring. Thunder and lightning, give me a break how many times did we have to hear this? Did he really just throw a record player like a Frisbee? In a town full of guys with AK-47s we a supposed to be afraid of 3 guys with whips!? The whole Beck not using guns issue really got old fast. Was Steven Segal busy?* The Ending * * SPOILERS ALERT * Did Beck even get his money?! Why poison them only for a few hours? This guy could obviously have Beck killed easily. Why even save this kids life? He gave Beck nothing but trouble the whole time. So here we are the movie is over and the viewer is supposed to believe that Beck traded 250,000 dollars and his dream of opening a restaurant for, life on the run from a Loan Shark with an annoying punk 20 something treasure hunter ?!!?!?3/10 Just for the Cinematography which was beautiful at times.

The Rock was awesome he brought a great presence to the movie. I could easily go and watch that again. The Rocks sexy charector excelled here.  I can't wait to see more movies like this from him.  It has far out rated any other films I have seen him in.  Yeah some of the scenes were a bit off the wall but it just added to the movie.
