0,nogodnomasters,YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING FROM YOUR PAST,4,20 July 2018,"Zoe (Sharon Leal) has the perfect professional and family life...yet she feels she has a void in her life. She is a sex addict, but a classy choosey sex addict who always wears the same bra during sex. The movie is extremely formulaic and the acting and script was dry.I am sure some people might find the subject matter interesting for one reason or another, I was bored with the cutout characters.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Good male eye candy.",Addicted
1,kosmasp,Cliche ridden,3,17 June 2018,"Now if you don't mind cliches, I guess you can have fun with this. If you like your 50 shades of whatever color is your special kind of kink, then you might enjoy it too. While I've only seen the first one of those (and did not read the books), I think comparing them is not that far out.There is a bit of flesh showing, though mostly without anything too much (except one scene I think), but that should not be the point you hold this movie accountable to. Even if it is the theme of the movie, which takes a very strange and even disturbing turn towards the end. Addiction is real and it's not wrong to seek professional help ... if nothing else, we know as much (or have learned that watching the movie?)",Addicted
2,neil-476,Boring and,4,19 June 2016,"A happily married family woman and mother explains to a psychotherapist that she has given into a desire to have sex with assorted other men.That's the plot, folks - about 15 minutes worth, I reckon. Yet it takes an hour and three quarters to tell it in a film peppered with sex scenes which don't actually have any sex in them, substituting coy avoidance instead. Yes, US cinema continues its perverse relationship with sexual matters whereby it is preoccupied with sex, but avoids actually showing an frankness on screen - beware the nipple, civilisation will fall.This film manages to be lurid, lame, prissy and interminably tedious all at the same time. Do, please, try to avoid it.",Addicted

""",6,14 October 2014,""". . . satisfied,"" complains well-to-do businesswoman married mom of two Zoe to her cut-rate shrink, Dr. Spencer, in the opening scene of ADDICTED. Zoe is describing the state of her marriage to an apparently hot architect BEFORE she explores the Latin side of the sheets with her art management company's latest client. As Lucille Ball once said, ""Once you've had Spanish, all the other guys vanish."" Or so they would for any normal woman, but Zoe has a mysterious scar on her arm indicating that she's been initiated into the realm of EYES WIDE SHUT sex club perversion. Early on this movie devolves into a poorly done Telenovela, with TV line deliveries, production design, shot blocking, and melodramatic, disease-of-the-night plotting. The only difference might be a smidgen more English dialog than usual. And what is it with Dr. Spencer, charging just a hundred bucks an hour for her services in a tony Atlanta psychiatric office. Since she's not exploring Zoe's brain ""Pro Bono,"" WHY is she charging 1950s rates? Explain that, if you can.",Addicted

5,davispittman,Iffy at times,6,8 March 2017,"Addicted (2014) is a movie about a wife and mother going behind her husband and whole family's back to cheat with several men. She starts to see a therapist about her need for sex all the time, and she learns she's a sex addict. The acting is alright, in some scenes it can seem a little hokey or soap opera like, but most of the time it's just fine. The lead actress did do a good job, her acting is by far the best in the whole cast. The writing is spotty. In some parts the dialogue is just fine, not incredible, but it suffices. Then there are some scenes where the dialogue is pretty cheesy/melodramatic. The sexual scenes don't go overboard and they are well lit and filmed. It was good to see that the sex scenes weren't like pornographic, because I think when the sex scenes go that far it ends up taking away from the movie as a whole. I don't really know if I would suggest this movie. I'll say this. If there is nothing else on and this is on TV, it's worth a watch, but if there's something better on or you have other options, then no. 6/10.",Addicted
6,Amari-Sali,"When a woman finds her husband unable to please her like she wants, she ventures out to find some men who can.",7,4 October 2016,"Trigger Warning: Rape sceneBefore 50 Shades of Grey was synonymous with mainstream erotica, there was the author Zane. Someone who wrote erotic books featuring Black characters and even had a soft-core porn series if I recall right. Though with it being a long time since Zane's name was big, and with Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor still being fresh enough to remember, does Addicted prove itself to be the best, as well as the original, or did all Zane do is open the door as bigger and better productions got through?Characters & StoryZoe (Sharon Leal) has a lot going for her in life: She has a gorgeous husband, named Jason (Boris Kodjoe); two beautiful kids; a mother, Nina (Maria Howell), who lives with them and allows her and her husband to work full-time, and pull in extra hours; and she has her own business. One which, thanks to her marketing expertise, and best friend Brina (Emayatzy Corinealdi), is quite the success. Well, at least until famous artist Quinton Canosa (William Levy) comes in. From meeting him, to being alone with him in his studio, something awakens in her which creates this desire to have sex. Something she tries to fix with a woman named Dr. Spencer (Tasha Smith), but the ecstasy, and other things, are too good to just give up. Leading you to wonder if perhaps Zoe may be able to have it all, or whether her secrets will destroy all she has worked and fought so hard for.PraiseBeing that I went to see this movie with a Black majority audience, naturally, there was talking throughout the movie and damn if I didn't want to join them. For truly the stuff which happens in the film will have you wanting to mumble something under your breath. Whether it is because of the things Zoe gets into while on a downward spiral; the things Quinton does around, or to, her; or even just waiting for anyone, whether it is Jason or Nina, to catch her; you will easily get caught up in the moment and want to throw your own two cents in there.CriticismWhile the book for Addicted came before Tyler Perry's movie, oddly enough his film was overall more entertaining. If just because Leal as Zoe has this Olivia Pope vibe and Brina very much seems like a gladiator. And with probably the most interesting thing about this film being the sex scenes, or the moments before Zoe initiates sex, it makes you wonder if any thought was really put into making Jason interesting, or even making Zoe's 2nd sex partner Corey (Tyson Beckford) more than someone she just meets in the club? For while I get that the focus is on Zoe, at times I felt like there was a stronger need to show how guilty she felt and why. For while it is understood her husband is attractive and good to the kids, I feel the stuff we saw in TP's Temptation gave us reason to root for the relationship seen on screen. As for Addicted, to me, Zoe and Jason at best just came off like two attractive actors mashed together, due to name recognition, who represented two people who had babies and have sex every now and then.Overall: TV ViewingIt is sort of sad that, in the grand scheme of things, you could make the argument TP may have been inspired by Zane's work when it comes to him creating Temptation. However, like with The Maze Runner, while you may see the film was inspired, in the long run, there is this sense that only what worked, and was good, was taken before the film went to find its own voice. Now, as for Addicted, being that the sex addiction angle isn't made to be that interesting, since more so it seemed Zoe was bored in her marriage than a sex addict, I must admit while I was laughing at what my fellow theater goers were saying, and thought they made interesting points, I think this movie would have been a lot more dull without their commentary. Hence the TV Viewing label for truly the comments made throughout the film I think are what made this not something to skip. For while no performance was bad, and the sex I'm sure will get some hot and bothered, the story just didn't explore any character enough for me to feel like I should be invested. And, in the long run, I feel that sex was used to compensate for a weak story.Things To NoteI have no idea who Diamond (Kat Graham) was supposed to be in this movie. Was she Quinton's live in lover, assistant, or what?When it comes to nudity, you'll mostly be seeing buttocks more than breast or anything else.",Addicted
7,richard-1787,A movie with a lot of problems,5,7 March 2015,"This movie has a lot of problems.Briefly, it's the story of a young professional woman, Zoe, with a husband, Jason, who would be every woman's - and some men's - wet dream. He has a perfect, muscled body, a smile that could melt an iceberg, and he even washes the dishes. They have sex 2 or 3 times a day. Not a week, a day.But it isn't enough for her. She wants more.But more of what? That's one of the problems with this movie. There is a lot of sex in it, though none of it shocking by modern movie standards. But for all the sex, we still have to guess at what Zoe wants. Is it yet more sex? Different sex? Kinkier sex? Is this a distant cousin to *Fifty Shades of Grey* that dares not speak of its desires? Zoe hooks up with an unsubtle but muscled white painter - who, in my eyes, has no talent - and has with him what looks like pretty much the same sort of sex she had been having with her husband. Then she hooks up with a messenger on a motorcycle. Their sex, though no doubt wonderful, looks pretty much the same as what she is having with the other two men, though it usually takes place on a table.In between all this, Zoe ignores her children and lets her work go down the drain. She is, we are to believe, a sex addict.That's the first problem. Zoe comes across as insatiable, but not really addicted. She only has men who are so astoundingly handsome/sexy that they would tempt all but the most virtuous. Yet if this movie had been called *Insatiable*, she would have come across as a harlot rather than a sick individual to be pitied, and would have lost the sympathies of the intended audience of well-meaning 20-40 something women. If she were actually addicted to sex, she would have had sex with anyone, and that is not the case. She is only attracted to the hottest men.The second problem is that her poor husband, Jason, evidently detects nothing once Zoe is unfaithful to him - daily. When he does finally learn he's unhappy, of course, but we know so little about him, he's so poorly developed, that we still can't sympathize with him, though he is the potentially most sympathetic character in the movie.These actors could probably all have done a lot better if they had been given a script that had developed characters and not just cardboard cut-outs. As it is, we get to watch a lot of evidently passionate sex performed by beautiful bodies, and then at the end have to listen to a few lectures on sexual addiction, which don't come across as very convincing. Zoe's particular case is never explored, so it's hard to believe in it or feel for her.Zoe's sexual problems with Jason needed to be made clearer. How was he failing her? Jason needs to have been given a character; it's not enough for him just to look great. The script just doesn't make any of the characters interesting and sympathetic, and that's fatal here.",Addicted
8,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Addicted,6,28 October 2014,"Addicted is essentially an uneven facade that in one instance, poses as softcore porn and in another instance, becomes a documented, public service announcement for sex addiction. It's a slick, trashy, yet mildly entertaining soap opera of a movie that unbeknownst to me, goes completely off the rails in its final half hour.Directed by the guy who made Honey (2003) and Beauty Shop (2005) and based on a best selling novel of the same name, Addicted is like a carbon copy of 2002's Unfaithful. But where Unfaithful had a murder and a sored cover-up to that murder, this limited October release has a silly, kill-free twist at the end (I'm not gonna count a failed suicide as murder in case you're keeping score). It also has many more love scenes in it than Unfaithful not to mention a main character that ends up having more than just one affair.The story begins with stunning, happily married businesswoman Zoe Reynard (played by Sharon Leal). She has the perfect life. She has two great kids, a husband who thinks the world of her, a loving, caring mother who lives with her (and is quite tolerable), and a beautiful home via the outskirts of Atlanta, GA. But wait a minute, her perfect husband isn't fulfilling her everyday needs (sexually that is). He's never around and is always working. Her solution: have a series of romantic trysts with a well revered painter (Quinton Canosa played by William Levy) and a womanizing club hopper (Corey played with minimal dialogue by Tyson Beckford). This leads to her addiction by which she literally ruins her career, fractures her family values, is forced to see a shrink, and decides in anguish, to (spoiler alert) commit freeway suicide. As mentioned earlier, Addicted walks a fine line between glamorizing sexuality and reiterating a certain sickness. As a result, the proceedings are choppy and disjointed despite a surprisingly good level of unpredictability.Really in truth, this vehicle is almost saved by Sharon Leal. She gives a solid, realistically grim performance in the lead role as Addicted's disturbed test subject. As for the rest of the cast, they are comprised of mostly good looking people who's acting is not as seething or as sharp. In conclusion, this is a poster child for the effects of sex addiction and to be honest, it's not really about infidelity. Addicted in its 106 minute running time, makes two mistakes: it turns a character (Levy's Canosa) who doesn't really seem menacing enough, and makes him psychotic. The second mistake is that this thing climbs too close to becoming a therapeutic healing session for a specific audience (people that go to support groups for sex addiction or don't bother to get help at all for said addiction). And as the plot thickens, it feels less like an actual film going experience and more like a hidden cry for help. Bottom line: Addicted as a drama/thriller, may offer a certain kind of appeal. But for me, it just wasn't that ""addicting"".",Addicted
9,bbickley13-921-58664,Way better than I expected.,6,16 October 2014,"A little more romantic than most recent films about sex addiction like Nymphomaniac part 1 and 2, but thankfully the movie does not dumb down the condition. Instead, simplifies it greatly. The movie focus is on a happily married woman who fills a void in her life when an affair with another man triggers her sex addiction using a more romantic approach. The entire cast did a good acting job. I've never seen William Levy in anything before, but I thought he played a good ""Mistress"" in this film. Lead actress Sharon Leal and Boris Kodjoe were also good in the movie. Not as melodramatic as you would expect from movies like this, and it had some pretty awesome love scenes. A winning combo for me.",Addicted

Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that you can't control who you fall for even in you are already in a commit relationship. The direction and screenplay are both really good.

12,chloegalley,Was okay !!! Not the best,5,5 January 2021,"Addicted is a 2014 American erotic drama thriller directed by Billie Woodruff starring Sharon leal, Boris Kodjoe, Tyson Beckford, Kat graham and William Levy. So the storyline is not bad as this does happen in real life as Zoe in the film being addicted to sex and how it can cause serious problems when in a relationship I think there showed that rather well in the movie with plenty of hot men lol. The acting was not the best but there did try their best to portray the characters. Very predictable In places but okay film have seen so much better though. So if you like fifty shades then you will like this just not as good. Currently streaming on Netflix right now. For adults only.",Addicted
13,bluepink,"Not relateable, so feels wrong watching it",1,31 July 2020,"Firstly - the blurb should clearly state that the movie is about sexual addiction - as it's the type of topic that some people won't want to watch.Next, I think the movie should have spent more time building context & getting us to relate to the main character first - before she started engaging in the distructive, erratic behaviour. Because it felt like we were watching someone ruin their perfect life (personal & worklife) for no reason. And we didn't understand why. So it didn't feel healthy to watch; or entertaining.Lastly, the script & characters needed more depth. E.g. the Spanish guy was so unrealistic - I don't believe that anyone would be that forward straightaway & cringy too. Overall - the characters were not realistic at all.Just to mention - I turned it off halfway (when her behaviour started to get repetitive) - but looking at the reviews it probs doesn't get better.",Addicted
14,ThatMonkey,Conflicted,4,20 March 2021,"I watched this movie out of complete boredom. The effects of Covid have left entertainment with an emptiness that you could not imagine.I have always had a thing for Sharon Leal and the opportunity to see her in something sexy was the true prize. On that note, the movie had it' moments. Sharon is beyond beautiful and sexy as ever, however, she is anything but believable. She shows her body, but it always feels like she is trying to shield or cover up. Partially because she doesn't want to be exposed, and possibly because the effects of motherhood may not be the most flattering look when she is completely naked.This is far from Fatal Attraction, but does remind me of Trois and Unfaithful. As someone that has had counseling for sex addition, I can tell you the themes of this movie are right on the money, but the execution and acting need a lot of work.This movie isn't the worst, but it's not good. It's too slow to be on pace, too tame to be risqué and too corny to be taken seriously. It's good for a release if you need it, but those moments are very few and far between. If you aren't interested in either lead, you won't like this film.",Addicted

The film is a sexy, provocative thriller based upon the sex-addition of art enthusiast ""Zoe Reynard"" played by Leal. ""Zoe"" has the desired life anyone could imagine; a beautiful house in Atlanta, Georgia, a faithful husband in ""Jason Reynard"" played by Kodjoe, a successful career, and two kids; but ends-up having love affairs with ""Quinton Canosa"" played by Levy, who she tries to nab as a client in her art agency, ""Zoe and Co.,"" short for ""Company"" and later on ""Corey,"" played by Beckford who she meets at a night club.This sex addiction impacts ""Zoe's"" relationship with her husband, her family life, and career in such a negative way, that she must seek counseling from ""Dr. Marcella Spencer"" played by Smith, to help her overcome this sickness for desired sexual fantasies. There are a few twists to this movie and if you go see it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.I would recommend going to see it with someone you've been dating for a while.

17,Bluesradio62,Addiction,8,21 March 2020,Yes Sexual Addiction is a very real addiction and this movie doesn't treat it with kid's glove.....Definitely lets you know about the manipulation and hiding that can go with this disease......Definitely some good acting and even the ones who are victimized by the disease are treated fairly in how they are portrayed and they can't get off lightly either....in some cases even showing the enabling....Has a hopeful and some would say sappy ending but a definite true movie....,Addicted
18,nishil-patel1,Poor script poor storyline,4,9 May 2020,To claim this story exposes sex addiction is absolute nonsense! It would not be right to describe this as soft porn either.

19,vinzarka,Bille Woodruff was not enough addicted of this movie!!!,1,31 March 2015,"Lack of information? Maybe this movie director doesn't still know what means to be addicted of something? To be addicted of hot dogs or underwear? To be addicted of sex, Mr. Bille Woodruff, it means to need sex time every time with different people and doesn't mean what color race or age that person is. I was expecting that woman to be hooked by every tool she would see in her company with her artist clients, to get hooked with every man in every steps she was doing again and again with the longest and the thickest tool she ever seen. She was supposed to be sick and what i saw it was just a normal love story full of bullshits feelings that were going to pretend that these feelings are because she was addicted. She was not at all addicted of sex. She was not at all hungry for tool and to get hooked by everyone. She was supposed to grab men in the streets and to hook with them and not just to be shy and other senseless sights.",Addicted
20,sooftennegative,Addicted not,4,15 September 2020,"The idyllic life of a successful businesswoman, wife, and mother of two is about to be uprooted as she nears middle age. She suddenly is stricken with sex addiction as a result of a horrible rape she endured but doesn't recall as a ten-year-old girl approximately 25 years ago.. We know this to be true of the beautiful Zoe by the end of the movie because we are told it is true. It is evidenced by repeated reference to a missing memory, an unexplained scar, and finally a dream near the conclusion where Zoe finally remembers. In the final moments of the movie, Zoe relates this information to her group of sex addicts, their psychiatrist, and finally her husband as he enters the room. The writers, director, producers, and the original novel dictate it is true, so we must accept it to be so. It is the name of the movie after all! She is addicted to sex...and it just happened...out of nowhere...just as she started a torrid sexual affair with a talented local artist. We are told she is addicted to sex... not having an affair. As she and her new lover view some of his work and have public sex, it is because of an addiction. As she poses nude for paintings for him and they then have sex, it is because of an addiction to sex and not a sorted affair. As she looks upon various other nude paintings of various young women with great jealousy, she is somehow not having an affair with this fellow but is just addicted to sex. As she discovers him sleeping with his neighbor and reacts with more jealousy we are to believe she was not having an affair but was merely addicted to sex. As her artist lover asks her to leave her husband and she tells her psychiatrist she is tempted to do so, somehow her counselor interprets this to be a sex addiction and not her having a family crushing extramarital affair.She is a beautiful woman. She could walk into any bar, gym, grocery, or bus station and say to the hottest guy ""if you have an hour, I will have you."" and that guy will likely have uncomplicated anonymous sex with her. That is what an addict would do. She does nothing even close to that and we are told she is addicted to sex while she pursues and is pursued by her lover in a typical cheaters fashion.But wait, there is another fellow she starts sleeping with. That will make two other men besides her husband. When one lover gets too clingy, she starts another affair. This hardly seems like an addiction but we have been told it is so. If you are a woman who is addicted to sex, I hope you are as lucky as Zoe to come across the real-life male model Tyson Beckford playing Corey. Her first sex with Corey as I recall was a quickie in a public bathroom at a club. This actually fits the mold for what I would call a hookup fitting a sex addict. Yet on their next tryst, Zoe gets all dressed up and wears uncharacteristic red lipstick. They party late into the night rolling around on the floor drinking booze and snorting cocaine. Sex addiction apparently involves an hours-long drug induced hot date while your husband and family wait at home wondering where you are. Just to be clear, she was on a date. She was not just hooking up with someone for sex. Just as with her first lover, she is hanging out with him having a good time. She is on a date. She is cheating on her husband. As she prepares to enter their home where her husband is waiting, she pauses to wipe away the red lipstick. She's just a little drunk and stoned with some disheveled clothing, but the trusting husband won't suspect anything if she's not wearing the red lipstick.To be clear, Zoe is merely a cheating wife. About 3 minutes of this movie are devoted to anything resembling sex addiction. Most people like sex. Cheaters certainly like sex. This movie is an embarrassment to the subject of sex addiction and has little to do with it. However the part when Jason accepts the diagnosis and takes her back to a round of applause from the sex addicts group members, just as the credits start to roll, helps to at least draw attention to the real thing.I really think Sharon Leal did a good job with the character Zoe considering the implausible plot. Boris Kodjoe playing the part of husband Jason gets my coveted oblivious husband award for actually seeming to believe the lies of his cheating Zoe. That took some skill. Tyson Beckford...hmm...is a great male model!",Addicted

This is actually one case scenario I have not yet battled with any client. But I do understand the therapist in this movie and how she used addiction lingo to get her message across to her client. She got it across to me as well. As a therapist, this is a case that you would use psychoanalytic theory to get at the harbored suppressed past, and I think they actually portrayed the addiction very well. I did feel very sorry for her husband (handsome husband) who is faithful and has this kind of woman for a wife...but love does conquer all.

Basic plot, woman addicted to sex, finds handsome men to do it with, pretty vanilla actually compared to what I thought it would be. Husband (who is absolutely gorgeous!!!) is the dutiful husband, taking care of the kids while wife is ""working late"". The last half hour was a bit unexpected but sympathy was lacking. Then obviously a relatively ""happy ending"" once the reason for her ""addiction"" is revealed. All in all, its not a bad film, but I wouldn't say its good.

I Don't know if the producers of this crap live in the real world, but in my version psychologists do not have sessions that run all day and into the wee hours of the night....what the hell?, and since when do supposed 'successful artists' drive beat up old 68 Chev's with the paint literally peeling off?....Believe me there is NOTHING in this movie worth taking seriously.What a shame Sharon Leal couldn't find something to actually bring her back into the light, instead of having the lights turned off and the door slammed shut.Terrible, just terrible.",Addicted
