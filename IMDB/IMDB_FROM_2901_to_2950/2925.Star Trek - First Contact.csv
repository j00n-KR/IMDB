0,MartinHafer,By far the best of the newer Trek movies--and one of the best overall,9,15 July 2006,"Although there are some aspects of the film that directly contradict episodes of the original series (such as ""Zefram Cochrane"" as portrayed by straight-laced Glenn Corbett in the show and the alcohol-sucking oddball played by James Cromwell in this movie), this is one of the very best Star Trek films. For me, most of this is due to the Captain Ahab-like performance by Patrick Stewart. In countless episodes of the original series and in the last movie, Picard was just too stiff and dull. But, in this film, he's pretty crazed and you see so much more emoting--and I'm sure MANY fans were glad to finally see this. I loved watching the good Captain mowing down the Borg with a Tommy Gun!!! In addition, the film, apart from Picard, has a very light heart and was pretty funny. Plus, it was great to finally see how and why the humans first came into contact with life outside our miserable planet! Exciting, well-written and full of wonderful fun--that's why I really liked this movie.",Star Trek - First Contact
1,TheLittleSongbird,'First Contact'- first rate,9,21 July 2017,"'Star Trek: The Next Generation' may not be quite as influential or as ground-breaking as the original 'Star Trek' series (though it certainly has those elements), but quality-wise it is every bit as good with a few improvements.The first ""Next Generation"" 'Star Trek' film, 'Generations', was to me not that bad but was frustratingly uneven (namely the treatment of Kirk and the emotion chip subplot). The next film, 'First Contact', was a significant improvement and highly deserves its reputation as the best film based of 'The Next Generation' series and one of the best 'Star Trek' films overall. Giving some of the supporting characters, like Worf and Crusher, more to do rather than giving them little screen time and not having them do much, was pretty much the only thing that 'First Contact' could have improved on.'First Contact' is one of the best looking 'Star Trek' films, feeling more expansive and cinematic and benefiting from significant technology advances. The cinematography is intimate, colourful, brooding and immersive, while the sets rich in detail and the special effects are first rate with a real sense of awe. Bringing Jerry Goldsmith back was a good move, and he and his son Joel produce a score that's rousing, haunting, menacing, melancholic and sometimes even pastoral. Oh and the main theme tune is a classic.Writing-wise, 'First Contact' is one of the best written and balanced of the films. The humour is genuinely funny and sometimes affectionate with the in-jokes, the emotional moments have real poignancy and a grandiose sweep and there is a real tension at times too. The story is perhaps the best paced, with no wasted or extraneous scenes and the one that gets to the point the most. The action is simply thrilling, and while some characters are underused there is still some interesting character development and interaction, namely a more conflicted Picard (in a way that's reminiscent of Captain Ahab), the scene between him and Lily and Data and the Borg Queen.Patrick Stewart gives his most intense and moving performance of all the 'Next Generation' films, and still has the commanding presence and the dignified gravitas. Brent Spiner is strong too, and he is much more restrained here with Data significantly better written. Jonathan Frakes is compelling as Riker but does even better in the director's chair, he doesn't lose any of what makes the series so great in the first place or what makes it so influential while showing some freedom to show his own style and open things up.Alice Krige is on seductive and deliciously slimy villainous form, while the Borgs are genuinely fearsome even now. James Cromwell and Afre Woodard excel in atypical roles to the work they're best known for, Cromwell in particular.In conclusion, first rate and a high point of the 'Star Trek' franchise. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Star Trek - First Contact
2,Leofwine_draca,Best of the Star Trek film franchise,7,2 January 2017,"This thoroughly entertaining movie is probably the best of the Star Trek movie series, thanks to a fast pace and a complex plot which throws in a number of different ingredients into the brew and keeps things moving at a speed, without ever becoming too technical or confusing. While the film is clichéd in places (that old ""countdown to self-destruction"" is pulled out of the stock ideas closet AGAIN) and guilty of being a rip-off in others, the sheer quantity and quality of the action, acting, set design, and fluid direction make it a rip-roaring adventure in the best old fashioned sense. Only a few times does it throw in some sickly sentimentalising, which is another plus.The main problem with the film is the lack of characterisation - as there are so many characters and situations packed into so little time, a lot of people get left out. A good portion of the film is made up of action and events, which leaves us little time to get to know the characters. Female crew members Marina Sirtis and Gates McFadden are near forgotten and get only a few lines after the inclusion of Alfre Woodard as a tough female heroine, who is admittedly good but hogs too much of the limelight. Meanwhile, Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton are relegated to near-cameo roles after being earthbound for most of the movie. This is understandable with Frakes, as he was busy directing after all, but it doesn't give much opportunity to check out Burton's cool robotic eyes very much.Patrick Stewart is as good as ever as Captain Picard, and here he's given plenty of opportunity to be tough and sweatily frightened in equal measure. The character of Data, the android, is also explored, which is quite interesting as he is mainly used as simple comic relief. Michael Dorn is wasted as Worf, the klingon member of the crew, and has little to do aside from run around and grunt a lot. Non crew-members include James Cromwell as the drunken inventor (very different role here) and Alice Krige who gets to play the chief villainess - a memorably slimy addition to the baddies, who gets a memorable introduction via her head and spine being inserted into the rest of her body.As time travel is used as a plot device, there are the expected number of plot holes which have been brushed over smoothly with lines of jargon as throwaway explanations, something which annoyed me a little. My favourite parts of the movie involve the crew exploring the parts of their ship which have been taken over by the Borg, including quite a few spooky moments which resemble the best bits of ALIENS. The Borg are an impressive army of cyborg killers, and the scenes of them being put together are a lot of fun in a grisly-but-tame kind of way. As a special effects-laden blockbuster (the CGI is incidentally pretty good), this movie is action-packed enough to appeal to both fans and non-fans of the series, and a lot of fun to watch - just don't expect anything too heavy.",Star Trek - First Contact
3,SnoopyStyle,Borg great villains,8,21 February 2015,"The new crew takes on the great villain of the new era, the Borg. The Borg have sent one cube and the Federation is gathering a force. On the other hand, the Enterprise is told to patrol the neutral zone with the Romulans. Starfleet Command doesn't trust Captain Jean-Luc Picard. When the battle goes badly, Picard disobeys orders and returns to earth. The Borg cube is destroyed but a small ship escapes. The small ship travels back in time changing the present and the Enterprise follows them to repair the damage to the past. They travel to 2063 when Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) is about to make first contact.A working knowledge of the Star Trek world is beneficial. It's a good thing that the filmmakers have figured out that a movie requires the greatest villains and the Borg is definitely one of the most compelling. It has a few laughs at the right time. It touches some profound literary concepts like Moby Dick. The space walk combat is cool. Jonathan Frakes takes the directing helm and he does a reasonable job. The story is the star here.",Star Trek - First Contact
4,Hitchcoc,Takes Trek to a New Level,10,6 January 2017,"Somehow the people that scripted the first of this series and did it poorly, came up with a masterful reprise. In this one, the Borg are back and they are dead set, like bees, on keeping the hive alive. They have no emotions and hence they cannot be manipulated. Here, the collective believes that going through a time warp into the past and stopping first contact, they will enhance their being. Others have done a masterful job in spelling out the details of this episode, so I will just say that there is a complexity and a totality to this that makes it utterly exciting science fiction. There are layers upon layers that have to be probed to get into the right situation to prevent a collapse of everything. All the players are quite aptly used and contribute to the final result. If you only see one Star Trek movie see this one.",Star Trek - First Contact
5,classicsoncall,"""We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.""",8,5 July 2018,"Oddly, I never moved beyond the original Star Trek TV series, so I'm not as familiar with the characters in the 'Generations' universe other than what I've picked up over time via film clips and the written word. So I don't know anything about The Borg and how they fit into the Star Trek universe. What I would have liked to learn from this picture was how Captain Pickard (Patrick Stewart) ever escaped from the clutches of the Borg hive mind in the first place. That was left a bit tenuous considering how powerful and invasive their reach appeared to be over the course of this movie.What I liked about this story was how the writers took us back in time to the inventor of warp drive. It was kind of comical seeing how some of the Enterprise-E crew held Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell) in such high regard, almost reverential in tone, when his actions and dialog in the picture seemed to defy the concept of a well disciplined scientist and inventor. The Borg Queen (Alice Krige) had a formidable presence in the film and was a powerful foe for Captain Pickard, though I detected an unforced error in the story line regarding the rigid parameters of the destruct sequence enabled by the Enterprise officers. Once in motion, the destruct sequence was supposed to be unalterable, but along comes Data (Brent Spiner), and with a flourishing finger wave, manages to disable the countdown. I really don't think you can have it both ways, even in a sci-fi flick.But see, here's where I think The Borg went wrong if their intent was to assimilate the entire known spectrum of life in the universe. Instead of transforming their deflector dish into an interplexing beacon, they probably should have created a second temporal vortex to confuse Pickard and the rest of the Enterprise. Then, by engaging their warp plasma generator, they could have instituted a temporal wake of chronometric particles that might have led the Enterprise crew on an interplanetary wild goose chase, thereby giving them the ability to complete their mission. Maybe if they went back to the Twenty Fourth Century and examined the video record, they could try again, but this time putting more trust in their astrometric readings rather than their EPS conduits.",Star Trek - First Contact
6,gavin6942,A Sequel and a Prequel at the Same Time,6,3 February 2008,"The Borg have returned and this time they're seriously determined to stop the Federation. So determined, in fact, they travel back in time to when Earth made ""first contact"" with the Vulcans, where the Borg hope to destroy the first warp drive and take over (assimilate) all of humanity. Picard, who had been ordered to stand down, doesn't accept this and follows the enemy with his crew in tow.I hate to say it, but this is one of the more pointless Trek films. I loved ""The Next Generation"" and I'd watch a film with the cast no matter how awful or stupid it was. So I enjoyed this one, as well. But generally speaking, it is just full of questionable situations and seemed more like a desire to cash in than any serious attempt to provide the fans with something substantial.After the series ended and we had ""Generations"", the time travel idea is really played out. The only reason to add it here is to tell a story about how man met Vulcans. But it's really better to do this in a prequel or something. Adding Riker and Troi to a crucial moment in history just seems to cheapen it for me. Why can't it happen without such big names involved? And I didn't care for the character of the the warp drive inventor (I love James Cromwell, but this was not a great role). And the Steppenwolf? Over a century later? Very out of sync with the series.The Borg revisionism was questionable, too. We have the Borg Queen inserted into the Locutus story, which she wasn't in originally. Her character in general is interesting but takes away from the concept of the Borg race. At least for me it does. The Borg, aside from Q, are probably the most interesting species on ""The Next Generation"" but I didn't think their presentation here was true to their being.Lastly, I was mixed on how to feel about Data being made more human. I understand we have to continue down the path of making him more and more like a human (adding knowledge first, then emotions and now pain). But it seemed so forced. Each film in the series has'a subplot of Data getting more human. Why so fast? On the show, it slowly progressed over years and years and then the movies came and made it a constant part of the story.After these complaints, you'd think I hated the movie, but I don't. I liked it quite a bit, and as I said I'm always ready to see the crew together again. I just got the impression this was a weak film. ""Generations"" was superior, as were many of the episodes. And when a television show is better than its movie, that's not really saying much for the film. It just seemed to be not in the spirit of the show. But if you like ""Next Generation"" (and I'm assume you do), you'll have to see this at some point. You probably already have.",Star Trek - First Contact
7,lee_eisenberg,"Resistance is futile, and it was pretty futile to continue the franchise after this movie.",7,29 December 2005,"My two favorite scenes in ""Star Trek: First Contact"" are the opening scene, and Dr. Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) disbelief of his future legacy. For the most part, the movie seems pretty much like most of the franchise, but they certainly do a good job with it. Patrick Stewart is always cool as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. Overall, I think that this was the last really good ""Star Trek"" movie; after this, they boldly went to where they'd gone before (my favorite ""Star Trek"" movie was ""The Voyage Home""). And personally, I think that this was Alice Krige's best role ever; ""Chariots of Fire"" was basically pro-western propaganda. All in all, definitely worth seeing.",Star Trek - First Contact
8,jboothmillard,Star Trek: First Contact,8,13 December 2006,"Star Trek has been a very successful film franchise, but of all the films made, this is the only so far that has been rated the full five our five stars by the critics, quite an agreeable amount. Basically the Earth made first contact with an alien race (the Vulcans)in the 24th Century, after World War III in the year 2056, and the dangerous alien species the Borg have returned to change the course of the future with this moment. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), who was once captured and became part of the Borg himself, and the crew of the new Enterprise ignore their orders from the failing Federation, and join the attack on the Borg cube. Part of the ""mission"" consists on getting into contact with the man who ultimately helps the future run on course, so Commander William T. Riker (Frakes) and Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) go to find Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell). The Enterprise is slowly being taken over by the power of the Borg, who are turning many crew members into the humanoid robot monsters they are, and they want the codes to take the ship as a whole. Lily Sloane (K-PAX's Alfre Woodard), unintentionally brought from Earth, advises Picard that the only way to stop them is to blow up the ship, and after initially refusing (with the ""No! No!"" and smashing quote South Park borrowed for the episode ""Something You Can Do With Your Finger""), he agrees. After many attempts to stop them, and many deaths and takeovers, the self-destruction of Enterprise is set, but the Borg Queen (The Little Vampire's Alice Krige) has managed to get android Lt. Commander Data (Independence Day's Brent Spiner) under her spell. Picard goes to rescue his friend, who has had human skin and the sense of feeling grafted, and he stops the bomb, but his mind has not been taken over enough, and he helps to save the day, and the first contact is successful. Also starring Michael Dorn as Lt. Commander Worf, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Marina Sirtis as Counselor Deanna Troi, Dwight Schultz as Lt. Barclay, Band of Brothers' Neal McDonough as Lieutenant Hawk and Robert Picardo as Holographic doctor. The special effects, acting and story (with in-jokes and stuff) are what make this what it is, The Journey Home may be my favourite of the films, but this is the best of The Next Generation, a great science-fiction adventure. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Makeup. Very good!",Star Trek - First Contact
9,Tweekums,Great action with the 'Next Generation' Crew,9,24 March 2017,"The 'Next Generation' crew are now aboard the new Enterprise and are surprised when they are ordered to patrol the Neutral Zone just as the Borg launch an attack on Federation space; Captain Picard realises it is because he still isn't fully trusted because he was once assimilated by the Borg. As the defensive of Earth is not going well Picard ignores orders and returns to Earth. Here he takes control and destroys the Borg cube but not before it launches a sphere which heads to Earth's past; as the Enterprise follows they observe an assimilated planet. Following it further back they witness it firing on the planet. The sphere is destroyed but unbeknownst to the Enterprise the Borg crew, including a Borg Queen have beamed aboard the Enterprise.It turns out the Borg returned to a very specific date; the day before Zefram Cochran piloted Earth's first warp ship and first contact with an alien species is due to be made. A group beams down to ensure his flight is able to go ahead as planned. Dr Crusher returns to the Enterprise with Lily, an injured colleague of Cochran. Soon there are anomalous readings and Picard returns to the ship. It soon becomes apparent that the Borg are on board. Contact with the away team is lost and those on board struggle to stop the Borg contacting other Borg vessels while those on the planet work to make sure the warp flight goes ahead as planned.This is probably the best of the 'Star Trek' films; the story is really good and there is plenty of varied, exciting action. The Borg are one of the most fearsome of the Star Trek villains due to their unthinking, and almost unstoppable, drive to assimilate everybody they meet; the way they turn friends into Borg is particularly unpleasant. Some of the films best scenes involve the Borg Queen's attempts to assimilate Data; more by seduction than force. Having Lily beamed aboard the Enterprise gave a good excuse for some exposition that would be needed by anybody who hadn't seen the television series. The regular cast are on great form; I particularly enjoyed Brent Spiner's portrayal of Data after he is captured by the Borg. The guest cast is impressive too; James Cromwell brings some humour to the role of Cochran, Alice Krige is delightfully menacing as the Borg Queen and Alfre Woodard is good in the role of Lily; a scene where she tries to change the mind of the excellent Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Star Trek TNG in particular and fans of action sci-fi in general it will help if you've watched the series but probably isn't essential.",Star Trek - First Contact

11,Quinoa1984,"""Don't be a great man, just be a man, and let history sort it out""",10,22 August 2016,"First Contact is not simply as a great Star Trek film. It's wonderfully smart and sophisticated science fiction period. Here's the hook that I like about it, which may or may not have been intentional (but given that Ronald Moore is the co-writer, the beautiful mind behind Battlestar Galactica, I'll say yes): we often think about being from other worlds coming to our own and how we see them and their technology, and that's the point of view, of US seeing the OTHER. The power with this movie is that because it's Trek, we have a vehicle for characters who are from another time and place, though who are us (in some ways more than others, usually more), and in this story as the Enterprise has to go back in time to the year 2063 with on one side The Borg to grapple with again and to make sure that a one-day-important man Zephram Cochrane (James Cromwell), who is basically a drunk who loves to dance to old time rock and roll and has somehow created what will be the warp drive everyone uses in the future, the roles are reversed. In short, we get to have a pure science fiction story that is loaded with ideas that, because it's the Borg (again, not unlike the original series the movies do a good course correct with their sophomore outing), we get to see what attaining ""perfection"" really means on contrast with a character like Zephram on the other side. It's a terrific balancing act.I'm sure that for Trek fans, and the ones for TNG I think are a *little* more fanatical than even the ones for the original series, could be wrong on that, there are great callbacks and just by making it the Borg, which was one of the highlights of that show and how intense and psychologically profound it got (what would happen if you were stripped of your personality and ""assimilated"" by an entire collective consciousness - an analogy for political persuasion I suppose but could be anything). But for general audiences, i.e. those who may not watch Trek or only do occasionally, it works on its own terms. The writers and director Jonathan Frakes make this fast moving but loaded with character motivations and arcs and plot - even for Alfre Woodard, who at first appears to be a supporting player, is probably closest to an audience surrogate and all the better for it (she gets to play a lot of emotions here, the full spectrum for bad-ass to terrified to indignation and wonder and awe and so on). And I think the themes it's wrestling with are easy enough to grapple with, about how what it means when you're thrust with the reputation of being a MAJOR leader and figurehead in the future, or if there's a being that can turn on and off an 'emotion chip' (""Sometimes, I really envy you,"" Picard comments, rightfully so), but also has the goal to become more human and is given that chance... by the villain. I can go on and on.It's also extremely funny - the great comedic lines are sharp and witty, or they play on character stuff like when Zephram gets Marian Sirtis' character drunk on ""this thing called Tequila"" - and has beats that combine humor and satire and suspense with seemingly great ease: when Picard has to buy a moment or two from the Borg, he ""brings to life"", literally, a chapter from a book that's set in a 1930's style nightclub (he in a fedora and suit, Woodard in period clothes, surrounded by extras and so on) until he realizes he's in the wrong chapter, pushes it ahead and is in a white tuxedo, gets a Tommy gun and blows away the Borg (much as he can do). This is one of those moments that would be brilliant in any movie, that could pull it off well, and this does. And at the heard of it all is the villain of the ""Leader"" of the Borg, played with aplomb and delivish villainy by Alice Krige, who wants to turn Data as with all beings into this ""perfect"" consciousness that she's had for so long. But does she truly know what she is? Or care? Certainly to Data it matters for much of the run time.Such rich conflict in this movie! And characters talking out their problems, like Picard's issue about whether he should or shouldn't destroy the Enterprise in order to save his crew from the Borg. And throughout the writers weave in clever ideas and concepts and give full SCI-FI moments like, I couldn't even believe it, Picard and Warf and that other guy going out with Zero-G space suits on to the ship to stop some thing-a-ma-bob from going off that the Borg's setting up, and that transported me to a direct place in science fiction cinema too - that slow-speed and all the more intense for it act of doing something in space where if you lose your grip on the ground you'll float away to death. This may be the best Trek film of the modern day, on par if not superior(!) to 'Khan' as a blend of adventure, story, action, and deeper philosophical notions about how we see ourselves, our roles in shaping the future, the past, and being ourselves throughout it all.",Star Trek - First Contact
12,CinemaSerf,Star Trek - One step Beyond...,6,17 December 2019,"Interesting how this film divides opinion like no other from this franchise. It is my least favourite (except perhaps ""The Final Frontier"") as it does attempt to impose a morality that is well beyond the scope of the talent involved - both on screen and at the typewriter. The effects are certainly special, but even with the quirky contribution of James Cromwell I'm struggling to think of this as anything better than a longer episode of ""Next Generation"" with all of it's pseudo-intellectual idealism. Like so many films directed by and starring their stars; objectivity is sometimes first under the bus - I fear that is the case here.",Star Trek - First Contact
13,dbborroughs,What happens when the Borg come for a visit,7,25 October 2009,"First of the Next Generation films is also a cracking adventure. The plot, which seems slightly borrowed from The Search for Spock, has the crew taking on the Borg and going back in time and helping with the discovery of warp drive and the very early founding of the Federation.Forget the details and just watch this for the action as Picard and his crew battle the Borg and the slimy Borg Queen. Its just a great amount of fun. Equally fun is the crew desperately trying to weigh the dangers of messing with the past in order to get home. It makes for some very humorous exchanges and helps to keep things light. One of the more enjoyable films in the franchise its worth a look.",Star Trek - First Contact
14,grantss,Entertaining,7,2 June 2020,"The Borg have invaded Earth's galaxy, resulting in a battle with Star Fleet. The newly-commissioned USS Enterprise-E, commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Pickard, is ordered away from the action as Star Fleet command fear that Pickard's previous assimilation by the Borg will affect his judgement. Once it is clear that Star Fleet are losing the battle, Pickard disobeys orders and sets course for Earth, arriving in the nick of time. The Enterprise manages to save the Earth from destruction but it is soon apparent that the Borg do not intend to destroy Earth but change the course of its history.Entertaining. Contains all the elements you expect from a Star Trek movie: action, danger to civilisation, technological solutions to problems and a touch of human drama and sentimentality.Decent plot that does have a few contrivances but, then, that's another Star Trek trademark. Good CGI, especially for the time.Solid performances with Patrick Stewart, as Pickard, to the fore. However, James Cromwell almost steals the show as the drunken, spotlight-avoiding, anti-hero who becomes a hero, Zefram Cochrane.",Star Trek - First Contact
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Return to form,8,4 November 2010,"When an alien force attempts to invade Earth, they travel back to the 21st century, pursued by the Enterprise. The plan appears to be to prevent first contact, meaning, the first time creatures from outer space directly revealed themselves to us and it could be proved. If this did not happen, our planet would be easy for them to take. And that's not all. It's no ordinary species we're up against. The Borg have returned(if you don't know what that means, don't jump directly to this, *watch Next Gen to find out*)! This time, they get a ""Queen""(portrayed sensually and impeccably by Krige), and while that is arguably going against the idea of no individuality, it gives them more to work with, and they *deliver*. We get fantastic character moments; the focus remains on Picard(who pulls a Captain Ahab... and is a bit of an action hero) and Data(could this mix of synthetic and organic be the answer to his wish to become human?), but they do very interesting things with them. The acting is spot-on for most concerned, including the delightful cameos(I won't spoil them for you). This can be pretty funny, if also sometimes silly. The writing is marvelous. This is well-paced, it never loses your attention. It is a proper movie, not an episode stretched to feature length; the stakes are high, and this has plenty of tension, cool battles and exciting sequences. All of the FX are great, not only the CGI courtesy of ILM. As when he directed TNG, we can tell that Frakes knows what he's doing. There is a bit of disturbing content and mild violence in this. The DVD comes with a trailer and a teaser. I recommend this to any Star Trek fan. 8/10",Star Trek - First Contact
16,view_and_review,None Too Impressed,5,3 October 2020,"I'm not a Trekkie though I've seen Star Treks one through six and ST:Generations. Having seen those seven films, it sucks to see that they've done time travel for a third time. They did time travel in part four with the whales, then again in ST: Generations, and now ST: First Contact.In this instance the time travel was a bit accidental. They were pursuing a Borg ship that was traveling back to 2063 and the Enterprise E got caught in the ""temporal wake"" of the Borg ship. The Borgs were attempting to prevent humans from successfully achieving warp speed and subsequently making contact with an alien race. This accomplishment was necessary for the advancement of mankind thereafter. If the Borgs could prevent this, then they could enslave mankind.I was none too impressed. It seemed like an extended episode of Star Trek: TNG, which I never really watched. It would've been nice to see them do something other than time travel where again they trample all over the space-time continuum. Forget about making ripples in the timeline, they make tidal waves in the timeline. You'd think that a people from that far in the future would know better.",Star Trek - First Contact
17,anaconda-40658,First Contact Lasting.,7,3 February 2016,"Star Trek: First Contact (1996): Dir: Jonathan Frakes / Cast: Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiners, Alice Krige, James Cromwell, Jonathan Frakes: Eighth film in the series, and one of the most inventive. In 2063 a red alert is in progress on the bridge of the Enterprise. The crew witness an attack on 21st century Montana on a missile. The following day first contact is to occur, and the first warp flight by Zephram Cochrane. They must convince him of his duty as well as defend the Enterprise against Borg forces. Data is captured and placed under some sort of seduction by the Borg Queen. They attempt to render him human. Well written with exquisite production and visual elements. Jonathan Frakes, known as Commander Riker in the series, dons the directing chair and does a fine job. Patrick Stewart is always compelling as Captain Picard who leads the battle against Borg forces as well as rescue Data. Brent Spiners is superb as Commander Data whose fate as a robot is tested but obviously continuous. Alice Krige steals scenes as the Borg Queen. James Cromwell plays Cochrane with comic relief. It is obvious that he will be convinced of his mission but Cromwell does so with scene stealing success. Jonathan Frakes plays Commander Riker, also straight from the TV franchise. Star Trek fans will not be disappointed with its unique visions and exploits. Score: 7 / 10",Star Trek - First Contact
18,movieman_kev,The Next Generation's best film hands down,8,17 June 2005,"The next generation crew of the Enterprise star in their best movie. Picard and his crew hitch a ride back in time to save the Galaxy from being infested with Borg, by saving the drunkard who invented Warp Drive from being killed by the Borg. This Star Trek movie is nuanced enough for the 'trekkies' to get into, while still being very accessible to the rest of the cinema going public. Johnathon Frakes, for all of his smarmy, cocky demeanor, still I have to admit that he hits a home-run in this initial outing (now his ""Insurection"" is a whole nother story, one for a different day) This film is action-packed, features good performances, and is just plain fun. All those aforementioned traits easily puts it among the top echelon of Trek films.My Grade: B+ DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary with director/actor Jonathan Frakes; Second commentary with writers Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore; Text Commentary with Michael and Denise Okuda Disc 2) 12 featurettes (Making 'First Contact', The Art Of 'First Contact', ""The Story, The Missile Silo, The Deflector Dish,From 'A' to 'E', Jerry Goldsmith: A Tribute, The Legacy Of Zefram Cochrane, 'First Contact': The Possibilities, Unimatrix One, The Queen, and Design Matrix); 3 Scene Deconstruction;Storyboards, Photo Gallery; Teaser & Theatrical Trailers; and Trailer for the Borg Invasion Hilton show in Vegas3 Easter Eggs: In the Main Menu, click on the sun for a list of all the alternative titles considered; In the Star Trek Universe menu highlight a circle for an interview with Ethan Philips; In The Borg Collective menu highlight a circle for an interview with Alex Jaeger",Star Trek - First Contact
19,Aaron1375,I liked this Star Trek thanks to the almost horror like villains.,6,27 September 2009,"This would be the last Star Trek I would watch in this particular set of movies (I watched and enjoyed the 2009 movie). I did not care to see the next movie as it did not look like it had a lot of money in it looking about as good as an episode of the television show. Having not watched that one I certainly was not going to watch the final movie featuring the next generation cast. As for the cast they are not my favorite group of people, I prefer the original characters, but this movie was okay to me. Granted it was an even numbered entry into the series, and as it goes for me I liked the even movies and disliked the odd movies. This one still has the cast I do not really like all that much, but it adds a really good set of villains known as the Borg, a group that resemble something seen in an alien/horror movie hybrid. Their scenes are good and well played out, as they stalk their prey at times like some sort of futuristic zombies. Unfortunately, these scenes switch to rather dull and sleep inducing scenes of the next generation crew helping a guy create the first warp engine. I also did not care for these scenes as they make the next generation crew so instrumental in the making of this important device, almost as if the writer was like ""Take that original crew! See my crew rocks more!"". Thankfully, more of the movie has the Borg scenes and even Alice Krige as a rather nasty Borg queen.",Star Trek - First Contact
20,Wuchakk,Solid Next Generation Trek film with The Borg,7,27 November 2015,"Released in 1996 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, ""Star Trek: First Contact"" features The Next Generation characters taking on the Borg, a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones in a hive-mind called the Collective. In order to escape imminent destruction by the Federation, a Borg mini-ship flees back in time to 2063 to prevent the renowned Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from accomplishing the initial warp drive and the subsequent first contact with an alien race, which later paved the way for the Federation of Planets. Alfre Woodard has a key role as a colleague of Cochrane.The Borg are an excellent villain and one of the greatest contributions of The Next Generation TV series, along with all its elaboration on Klingon culture. Here the Borg are augmented by the introduction of a Queen (Alice Krige), which some feel detracted from the impersonal and eerie race while others think enhanced them. It makes no difference to me personally, but it fits the parallel of a queen bee in a honey bee colony. Besides, why wouldn't there be a central intelligence?There are some gems to mine from the proceedings, like Cochrane's revelation of his carnal motivations for developing warp drive and Picard's hell-bent desire to annihilate the Borg. Speaking of Picard, Patrick Stewart carries the film with his unique star power, which is very different from Shatner, but just as effective.Interestingly, The Next Generation TV series never developed a prominent triumvirate like Kirk/Spock/McCoy, but rather a dyad, Picard and Data. Whereas this duo was core to the previous TNG film, ""Generations"" (1994) and the last one, ""Nemesis"" (2002), it's not as evident here until the last act when Picard attempts to rescue the charismatic android, but that's only because they get separated early on and Data ends up hanging out with the Borg Queen. By the way, Picard's self-sacrificial desire to save Data reveals a weakness in the script: After the Enterprise is set to self-destruct, Picard only has 15 MINUTES to rescue Data and escape the ship, but Picard is shown having a meaningful discussion with Lily (Woodard). Why sure!Another gem of the film is the revelation of the alien race at the end, which prompts a ""Wow"" reaction to fans of Star Trek (although erudite Trekkers undoubtedly knew what was coming).There are other flaws, like the jarring, contrived excuse for going back in time and the questionable fiery confrontation between Picard and Lily. I say ""questionable"" because something about the sequence renders it somewhat shaky; it may be the acting, the writing or some combination, but they needed to work out the kinks. Still, that scene has some good aspects, like Picard's line: ""The line must be drawn HERE!"" and the build-up to it.While I favor 1994's ""Generations"" to ""First Contact"" because of the fascinating story elements, e.g. the Nexus, and the potent subtext (see my review), and even marginally prefer the underrated ""Nemesis"" (2002), this doesn't take away from the fact that ""First Contact"" is a quality installment in the series, which gets better with repeat viewings despite its weaknesses.The movie runs almost 111 minutes and was shot in the studio with location shooting at Angeles National Forest and Green Valley, Arizona (substituting for Montana).GRADE: B",Star Trek - First Contact
21,trashgang,action from the first minute until the end,8,26 October 2016,"The first real mission for the new generation of Enterprise fleet and for me this was an outstanding entry in the franchise. Bye bye to the annoying Data like in Generations welcome to the real Data. Not only that, this delivers also on the part of effects.Not only was the story great because it's full of action from the first minute until the end. It was watchable due the great effects not only in space but also on the make-up. Borg looked stunning and all cyborgs did work out fine. Sure, you will be reminded of Species (1995) and The Terminator (1984) when you see the Borgs but never mind, it isn't a copy.If you don't are a Trekkie geek this one surely can be watched without knowing a thing about the Enterprise.

22,Mr-Fusion,Self-assured greatness,7,9 December 2013,"I was always under the impression that Jean-Luc Picard had (mostly) overcome his traumatic assimilation at the hands of the Borg - but as ""First Contact"" opens, he's still profoundly scarred. But in this movie, he's sort of a proxy for seeing the show's greatest enemy in a brand new light. The cinematic production values show them as much more than just extras in rubber suits. The makeup here is terrific and it helps greatly in showing the crushing dehumanization (not to mention pain) of the assimilation process. You can see in an instant why our Captain is still monumentally ticked.This is ultimately a movie where all of the parts are working together harmoniously. A fine cast (Alfre Woodard and Alice Krige, especially), great effects, and superb direction under Jonathan Frakes. And almost two decades on, that space walk on the deflector dish is still really cool. But to put this in perspective, this was the first real TNG movie, and it blasts onto the screen with an undeniable self-confidence. And it's en excellent marriage of science fiction and action movie; moves with a distinct energy without feeling like a jittery mess.Great movie.8/10",Star Trek - First Contact
23,Rainey-Dawn,A Magic Spaceship Ride,10,7 November 2016,"A good follow-up film to Generations. For first time viewers: you do not have to watch Generations to know what is going on in First Contact but it would help you to know Picard's history with the Borg (although Picard does briefly explain it in this film).The Borg is out to assimilate and go back to the 21st century in order to alter the course of history, to stop Earth's first contact with intelligent alien life. The enterprise gets caught up in the shockwave of the Borg's time travel and end up in the 21st century with some of the Borg on the Enterprise. The captain and crew must stop the Borg from assimilating the crew and make sure the first contact happens for the Earthlings with the aliens (Vulcans).Excellent film for sci-fi and Star Trek fans. Well worth watching.10/10",Star Trek - First Contact

25,sddavis63,Without Doubt This Is The Best Of The Next Generation Movies,7,2 July 2010,"The subsequent two TNG movies would disappoint. Both ""Insurrection"" and ""Nemesis"" were weak follow-ups to ""First Contact"" and not especially worthy additions to the Star Trek canon. But ""First Contact"" can't be overlooked. It's a pretty decent adventure that does a lot of things right, combining both the action and the humour and even a few scenes of philosophical reflection that characterized Star Trek at its best. The weaknesses - and they're present - can't be overlooked. The Borg were perhaps the best Star Trek bad guys ever, so perhaps it was inevitable that they would be chosen as the plot mechanism for the first TNG film, but still that choice seemed to suggest a lack of creativity. The Borg had been done to death on the TV series. Still, they served the purpose well and presented a realistic threat.In the story, the Borg have gone back in time to prevent Dr. Zefram Cochrane (in the Star Trek universe the inventor of warp drive) from making his first warp voyage, which leads to the Vulcans discovering earth. Without that first contact with the Vulcans, earth becomes easy pickings for a Borg takeover, and so the Enterprise follows the Borg back in time to make sure history turns out as it should. The time travel motif is perhaps another somewhat overdone Star Trek motif. Still, everything worked together pretty well. The story (or stories, because there were really two) were fun to watch and the cast of characters worked well together.The movie is set in two different locations. On earth, Riker and Troi and LaForge work with Cochrane (who's played here by the always solid James Cromwell) to make sure his ship launches. The humour of the movie is found here. To the folk from the future, Cochrane is a larger than life hero. In reality he turns out to be a hard drinking rock and roll loving guy who just wants to make enough money to escape to a lonely island - a reluctant hero at best who's none to pleased to discover that he's going to be remembered by history. This was an interesting reflection on larger than life historical figures, whose basic humanity can be lost in the tide of legend that overcomes them. Meanwhile, on the Enterprise, Picard, Data, Worf, Crusher and Lilly (Cochrane's sidekick, played by Alfre Woodard) do battle with the Borg. As always in encounters with the Borg it seems pretty hopeless (and, as always, you know that Picard et. al. will overcome them in the end - the question is how.) There's interesting reflection here on the issue of obsession, as Picard is motivated largely by his own memories of assimilation from the TV 2-parter ""The Best Of Both Worlds,"" and becomes very clearly a Captain Ahab type character who finally gets pulled back into reality by Lilly - the only one willing to question his authority.It's a decent movie - the best TNG movie, and one of the better Star Trek movies in general.",Star Trek - First Contact
26,thesar-2,The Line Must Be Drawn Here!,9,19 April 2009,"Where 'Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home' had its multiple silly premises and only based on comedy, 'Star Trek: First Contact' got the same concept (time travel to save the future) correct. Absolutely correct. Part 8 in the series was almost flawless in adventure, comedy, suspense, mystery and special effects. I admit, when I first saw this in theaters 13 years ago, I didn't like it. I wasn't really attuned to the Borg's background, but I knew it didn't have to do with individuality, which is shown with the Borg Queen. And I thought ""another time travel"" adventure, whoopee. When first released on DVD (or, I think video, back then) I gave it another chance and absolutely loved it. I've seen it now at least a dozen times. The movie screams adventure with multiple story lines – Riker and part crew have to convince a very human Dr. Zefram Cochrane to conduct the first human warp mission, Picard on his Ahab journey, Data and the Queen working together and, of course, the onslaught of the Borg. This movie was exciting, had sharp & funny dialogue (too many to print – but one very much worth mentioning: ""So you're all astronauts on some sort of... star trek?"" which to my knowledge is the first time the words ""star"" and ""trek"" were spoken in the history of the series), a Data who could turn off his emotion chip in a blur (the number one flaw of the previous film was that he could not) and great confrontations between key players – Picard and Lily, Picard and Worf, Data and the Queen, and Cochrane vs. everyone. It also was great to see the cameos from Voyager's doctor and Barclay. The movie wasn't without flaws, but it certainly is worth seeing as the more adult 'Part IV.'",Star Trek - First Contact
27,bowmanblue,"The best 'Next Generation' trek film, by far",8,21 February 2015,"Piccard and his crew didn't get as much (big) screen time as Kirk, so there's not that many other of his movies to compare First Contact to. However, it is definitely the best of all the next generation's filmic outings.Possibly its greatest strength is that it can be watched by people with no prior knowledge of Star Trek lore. It's about a race of (effectively) space zombies, known as 'the Borg' who travel back in time to take over Earth. Therefore Piccard and co must follow them back and teach 'em not to mess with us earthlings.What you have here is a fun, sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and space aliens. If you know Star Trek, you'll probably already have seen this one. However, my challenge goes out to all those out there who consider 'Trek' to be the domain of spotty nerds in their mothers' basements - if you're in any way interested in sci-fi, try this one out with an open mind, you may get a pleasant surprise.Note: I do happen to live in my mother's basement, but I don't speak Klingon.",Star Trek - First Contact
28,ThomasDrufke,Assimilate This,8,15 July 2016,"Captain Jean-Luc Picard and crew were second fiddle to Captain Kirk in their first feature film together in 1994's 'Generations', but that wasn't at all the case in 'First Contact'. Putting a newfound focus on the new crew and a new real sci-fi adventure proved to be what was needed to make the best Star Trek film in years.Re-introducing the Borg was a good choice as the conflict with the Klingons seemed to be getting a bit tiresome. Plus, with improved 1996 special effects, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the Borg as terrifying science fiction species. And that brings me to my favorite elements to First Contact, it's true sci-fi aesthetic. Sure, you still get a classic Trek adventure, but I don't think the other films in the franchise capture the science fiction side to the series as well as First Contact does.The main crew are joined by now-prominent actors, James Cromwell, Alfre Woodard, and Neal McDonough. McDonough plays a throwaway crew mate on the bridge, but Woodard and Cromwell are given plenty to do. Unfortunately for Cromwel and other members of the Enterprise crew, their 21st century earth bound mission is not as compelling as what is going on in space.While Woodard spends most of the film attempting to understand what's going on, she serves as a great counterpart to Picard's spiraling emotion. With Picard's unfortunate Borg history, he has a tough time comprehending any other strategies besides what his own mind tells him. Woodard is the only one that can get to him. Their bond and blossoming relationship is the type of thing previous films have been missing. Or really any well-written female characters at all.After taking a few films off, Jerry Goldsmith returned to score First Contact. Goldsmith has always had a keen sense of when to hammer in that heroic side to the Star Trek theme at just the right moments, First Contact does so impeccably. The CGI is also surprisingly polished. The mixture of practical and digital is seamlessly handled.Though Star Trek films seem to have the same structure, First Contact steered away from some flaws of the previous entries. Keeping the fun tone while throwing in some homages to Alien and Terminator with the Borg's presence was a perfect way to kick off The Next Generation's own film without having to rely on old characters. Star Trek First Contact is easily one of the best installments of the franchise to date.+Real sci-fi+Borg were a nice change up+Woodard and Cromwell+Focus on the team instead of the old crew+Score+Homages to classic sci-fi films-Earth bound material is a bore8.3/10",Star Trek - First Contact
29,ericstevenson,"Hi, Picard!",9,8 September 2016,"I feel bad for not having seen an episode of any ""Star Trek"" series. I especially feel bad for not watching what some people consider to be the most significant or sophisticated show, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". While ""Star Trek Generations"" did introduce us to them in film, its main problem was that it was too rushed. This, on the other hand, is just paced perfectly. I felt like the length of this film was just perfect. It went on just as long as it needed to. This is another movie to feature time travel. While I personally didn't like it as much as the fourth entry (which also featured time travel) this is still a film worth looking at.The best parts are probably how each of the characters gets a fair amount of screen time and they contribute well to the story. Maybe I would have to be more familiar with these characters to understand their struggles. We get some great scenes with Picard, especially when he shows such rage. The Borg are great villains in this. I simply love the effects in this movie. Everything is so wonderfully detailed and the costumes are so exact. The Borg Queen is also great as a singular villain. It's weird how the ""Star Trek"" villains aren't really that well known. I'm glad to be introduced to such a popular series of characters.For me at least, this was the first time I saw these guys as actual astronauts! You know, with how they actually used space suits. We even get a nice title drop, which seems pretty obvious for something so popular. I also love the idea of enemies who can adapt. I feel bad that the original series had a lot of better movies.

31,CuriosityKilledShawn,Last greatness,7,28 December 2013,"I'm not a fan of JJ Abrams re-incarnation of Star Trek, not by a million miles. So if I want to have fun Trek time I have to look way back to previous generations (ironically this time the Next Generation) and to 1996's Star Trek: First Contact - the last truly great Trek movie.Haunted by dreams of the techno-zombie Borg race calling to him Picard wastes no time (okay, maybe a little) in charging the Enterprise into a Borg battle with the Federation above the Earth. The cube is successfully destroyed, but the Borg manage to travel back to the mid-21st century, a time when Earth is fractured due from World War III, and try to prevent the first meeting between humans and aliens.Zefram Cochrane is the man who makes that connection with his first ever warp drive flight, and he's not quite the squeaky clean hero that the Enterprise crew thought he would be. Meanwhile, with their escape pod destroyed, the remaining Borg slowly take over the Enterprise, with their as-yet-unseen Queen attempting to seduce security codes out of Data with promises of humanity (a clever reversal of Borg culture).Naturalized Star Trek movies tend to fare better with audiences. Both First Contact and the Voyage Home are more accessible for non-Trek fans but still have a sense of adventure and a strong connection to the universe (pun intended). First Contact also receives a huge boost from Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score, which is his best Trek effort and certainly one of his best scores overall. The action is a little bit clunky (endless generic Enterprise corridor scenes get a bit tiresome) but the character chemistry is pitch perfect and there is a good variety in the excitement.",Star Trek - First Contact

33,ironhorse_iv,This is my first contact with this film. Resistance is futile. You will love this movie as well.,8,2 May 2013,"In my opinion, this movie was pretty good. I love the analysis of Captain Jean Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) quest for revenge against the Borg being similar to Herman Melville's Moby Dick character Ahab whom in the book wanted revenge on a White Whale that took his leg. Six years ago, he was assimilation by the cybernetic Borg, and barely escape from it as shown in Star Trek: The Next Generation episode 'The Best of Both Worlds'. It's weird how there is two types of Picards. Picard here in the movie is like James T. Kirk, who acts in violence, disobey orders, and have pointless action scenes. In the TV series, Picard is a intelligent, mostly non-violence person who doesn't act upon violence unless it's a last resort. In the TV series, Picard was even nice to the Borgs choosing not to wipe them out when he had the chance because he believe that Borgs have the right to live. This belief happen after 'The Best of Both Worlds' episodes. Here in the movie, Picard is like I want to kill them all. Love the Holograph rampage that become a Internet meme later on. It's weird in a way, that the Federation was trying to stop Captain Jean Luc Picard from joining the Borg battle due to that reason. Despite him, knowing more about the enemy than anybody else in the Federation. I thought they would use him.In the past, at less in the Next Generation episodes, Picard was allowed to take control of three ships to kill the Borgs when they were trying to destroy a few space colonies. Anyways, Picard didn't follow the orders and join the fight against the Borgs in the beginning of the movie. Don't feel bad, Picard; the cast of Deep Space Nine wasn't invited despite USS Defiant being there. At less, the doctor from USS Voyager had a cameo in the film which was kinda funny. The Borgs were attacking Earth so they can assimilation them, but this is where the plot get confusing. The Borgs assimilates some, but allow others to live, because they don't find them a threat. By others- I meant people with guns.The writers of the movie wanted a story involving the Borgs, but the producer wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too much like a bathetic novel. It would had been campy and over the top. Plus, Picard in tights wouldn't be a pretty sight. The entire plot doesn't make much sense, anyways. Rather than going to a remote part of space and time travel to Earth which would be safer for their Cube ship. They go near 24th century Earth where they were attack by hundreds of space ships. The cube ship is no shock destroy, as a Borg sphere ship escapes back into time in a worm hole which the USS Enterprise follows. The Enterprise arrives in the past, on April 4, 2063, the day before humanity's first contact with alien life after Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) historic warp drive flight. James Cromwell was great and funny in the role. It's so unlike most of his serious dull roles that mostly follow his career. Still, it was a bit weird to see him play Cochrane and yet play other bit characters in the TV series such in the episodes 'The Hunted' and 'The Birth Right'. I just can't like Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) because she always just in the way, and brings nothing to the table. Anyways the plot goes from assimilation them to now stopping first contact, which doesn't make any sense. If the humans never went to space the Borg would have never heard of them, so they wouldn't know they existed, so in a way, there would be erasing their history as well since there was no need to go to the Planet Earth. Plus, why are they assimilating them anyways? The Borg aren't primarily interested in humanity, a lesser species with unimpressive technology. They're making it seem that way, to attract the attention of the being they really want to assimilate says Q. Honestly, John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q was indeed in one of the first drafts of the screenplay. Anyways, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) is probably my second favorite Star Trek villain besides Khan. She was pure evil. Alice was such a trooper. Krige suffered a large amount of discomfort filming her role; her costume was too tight, causing blisters, and the painful silver contact lenses she wore could only be kept in for four minutes at a time. Love the make up on her. The Borg were redesigned to appear as though they were converted into machine beings from the inside-out; the new makeup sessions took four times as long as on the television series. The supporting cast of the crew did what they can. Nothing worth saying about their acting. Commander Worf's (Michael Dorn) head still looks like a fanny. The special effect are great, surprising in the fact that Industrial Light & Magic rushed through it to complete the film's special effects in less than five months before the release date. The music is amazing, and yet another great job by Jerry Goldsmith. Love hearing Stepphenwolf 'Magic Carpet Ride"" in the film. Director and cast member Jonathan Frakes AKA William Riker did a good job with his first film. Despite the sloppy writing and vague assumptions. I will admit the plot is full of holes, but I still really like this movie. There's a few inconsistencies, but they're forgivable with how great the action is. I know the Time Travel thing is a pretty bland idea, but overall this was quite an enjoyable film.",Star Trek - First Contact
34,The-Sarkologist,Star Trek attempting to create a horror film,6,15 June 2012,"The first movie spin-off from the Star Trek: Next Generation franchise felt like simply an extended double episode that was made for the big screen, and in a way I got the same impression with this film as well, even though I did enjoy it and enjoyed it somewhat the second time around. I have just finished watching all of the Deep Space 9 episodes and during that time I have been checking up a lot about the Star Trek universe on wikipedia, so when I read the entry for this movie I had a desire to watch it again.First Contact does come across like an extended episode, though no doubt it was more expensive that a simple episode. The crew returns with a new Enterprise (and new uniforms, which transfer over to Deep Space 9 at about the same time in the series). I am not sure where the other movies slip in though considering they seem to have been placed during the Dominion War. I do find it strange that we never see the new Enterprise E appearing in any of the later Deep Space 9 episodes, or even Picard making an appearance, considering that Starfleet's flagship would most likely be fighting on the front lines of what was quite a devastating war.The Borg have attacked Earth again, but the typical bureaucracy of Starfleet pushes Picard out to the Romulan Neutral Zone in case his previous encounters with the Borg may prove problematic to the defense of Earth. However, as is expected, Picard disobeys orders and returns to Earth just in time to destroy the ship. However it is not all over immediately as an escape pod is ejected and begins to travel back in time to the mid-21st century, and Picard orders his crew to follow it. This is where the title of the film comes in because they arrive a couple of days before Earth makes first contact with the Vulcans. Once again they destroy the borg ship, but not before it severely damages the first warp drive ship being built, and also not before them manage to transport onto the Enterprise and begin to assimilate the crew.As such there are two plots running concurrently. On Earth the away crew, led by Riker and La Forge are racing against time to get the ship launched on schedule, and also attempt to convince an alcoholic Zephram Cochraine to go ahead with his warp drive test to alert the Vulcans to their presence. The second plot has the crew of the Enterprise, led by Picard, attempting to deal with the borg and to stop them from alerting other borg of their presences and the presence of Earth.After watching the entire season of Deep Space 9 I have come to really appreciate the Star Trek universe and some of the races that appear therein. Of course I always balk at this idea of a perfect, cashless, religionless, society where humans are always trying to better themselves. It just seems to be to be an unrealistic utopia that could never come about. Further, the whole idea that humans do not engage in conflict anymore seems to be silly, particularly when there is conflict within the episodes. Obviously the idea is to write off such humans as bad influences (such as the Marquis) and consider them destructive to the Federation.I did quite enjoy this movie, though it is one of those movies that you do need some familiarity with the series to at least understand the characters. When the film opens it is automatically assumed that the audience knows who the characters are, there is really no introduction. As such to viewer who is not familiar with the Star Trek franchise, it can be a little confusion. Personally, having watched Star Trek in the past and being familiar with many of the characters that make an appearance, the problem is not really so great for me, and it is also difficult to see it from an alternate point of view. What was also a little disappointing was that the only character that came back from Deep Space 9 for the movie was Worf, and I noted that the crew of the Defiant were pretty much nameless crew members. It would have been good to have at least seen Dax in the episode, or maybe some of the other characters, but I suspect that bringing characters across from Deep Space 9 may have added some more awkwardness to the movie that is not needed.In a way it sort of come across as part horror movie, as far as Star Trek can go with the horror genre. I suspect that is what they were trying to do with the Borg invasion of the Enterprise. First we have them scooting around the ventilation ducts as if it were an Alien movie, then we have the Borg Queen grafting skin onto Data to give him the sensation of humanity. In some horror films the concept of flesh plays a significant role, however in this film it is simply the representation of Data's desire to become more human. In the end he does sacrifice his new found skin, and sensation, to save the lives of his friends.",Star Trek - First Contact

37,zkonedog,A Return To Action,10,12 March 2017,"After chasing God in Star Trek V, reenacting the Cold War in IV, and being offered an ultimate ""fantasy life"" in Generations (all very philosophically-themed films), Star Trek: First Contact shifted its focus to action/adventure, and was better served for it. Plus, not only was the film a rousing adventure, but also contained the emotions to back it up.In this film, the Next Generation crew is reunited with the Borg (whom, perhaps with the exception of Klingons, are the most compelling villain race in the Star Trek cannon). This reunion touches an extremely raw nerve in Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who once was captured and tortured by the Borg, setting up the emotional drama of the film. The ""Picard meltdown"" scene is one of the best in the entire Star Trek series as far as emotional conflict is concerned. While trying to stop the Borg from changing the entire course of human space travel (the main plot of the film), Picard must balance his intense hatred of the one-eyed automatrons with the safety and well-being of himself, his crew, and the entire human race.Besides that strong emotion, though, the other aspect of the film that succeeds is its ability (much like the II-IV movies) to give all the Enterprise crew something important (and interesting) to do. Worf tries to secure the ship from the Borg, Data is heavily drawn into the Borg's plan (being a cybernetic being himself), while Riker, Geordi, and Troi must help Zefram Cochrane gain the confidence to lift off on the most important of all manned space flights. Each story is just as compelling as the other, with Worf providing the bulk of the action, Data adding more emotional conflict, and Riker/Geordi/Troi pushing the main plot forward as well as adding doses of humor.To conclude, Star Trek: First Contact is easily the best Star Trek film featuring the Next Generation cast, and I would argue rivals movies II and IV as the best in the entire series. With its combination of action, emotional drama, time-travel plot (those always keep you thinking!), and sly humor, this film combines all the positive aspects of the Star Trek cannon and tops things off with a great script and spot-on acting. If you have never seen a Star Trek movie and could care less about the ""old guys"" (The Original Series cast), this is the movie to start with. If you were introduced (albeit rather poorly) to the Next Generation crew in Star Trek: Generations, this movie will properly acquaint you to the show.",Star Trek - First Contact
38,johnnyboyz,I do hope that my first contact with First Contact will be the last.,5,12 December 2011,"I don't know about you, but shouldn't the principal characters in 1996's Star Trek: First Contact be divulging as little information as possible to certain others of whom will go on to achieve certain things? The issue rears up when the likes of the Next Generation crew of Star Trek's famous U.S.S. Enterprise end up travelling quite a way back in time. Once there, they meet a man who will go on to attain levels of greatness and achieve certain things within a specific field that make everything within the 'universe' of Star Trek possible. Whilst the crew are there, they will inform him of all the great things he will do, say and leave behind once he is officially acknowledged of his invention more broadly along the lines of a space vessel capable of travelling great distances at great speed. How it is the crew get to be as far back in the past is down to the fact it had already been changed to a greatly dramatic and detrimental effect anyway; thus, it seems a little odd that these people would be doing their utmost to revel in tempting things to be different by dangling the carrot of change in-front of a man destined to make everything as it once was.Then again, such blundering thought processes are at the core of First Contact - the first Star Trek entry up to this 1996 point to which I did not necessarily take, a bland and ill-thought through piece with a distinct lack of sense applied to a delicate situation, one might say neatly summarising the overall application of film-making to the project as a whole. In short, it is a fairly tepid; muddled and underwhelming, in spite of the great stakes, entry to a series that has indeed surprised me in its accessibility. Patrick Stewart returns as the captain of this still fresh crew, a certain Jean-Luc Picard, and he is so good at filling the role of the boss that one does not at any point long for the days of Shatner's Kirk; not that he wasn't any good, on the contrary, but we acknowledge things have shifted and do not necessarily 'miss' what once was. We observe Picard being plagued by nightmares of time he once spent as captive to a species known as The Borg, a fierce race of militarian begins the step up in aggression stakes from that of the Klingons and often resembling Terminator's following the removing of half of their facial skin surfaces.Out of nowhere, The Borgs attack Earth and there is a grandeur space battle during which the Enterprise resist orders and chip in – something which culminates in the getting caught up in a time warp wherein The Borg have successfully invaded Earth, after having gone back to the fallout of World War Three in the 2060's, and the year the Vulcan's came to make ""First Contact"". Stunned, the Enterprise nip into the time stream and end up further back in the past in an attempt to make it so that history followed on correctly. Key to proceedings is James Cromwell's Zefram Cochrane, a shambling, often drunk, sheepskin coat wearing Roy Orbison enthusiast whom we're told is capable of creating a space ship and has advanced skills in the mathematics and sciences required to do such a thing. Here is the man who will build something so important that nearby space crafts will pick up on it and realise that Earth has advanced its technology.Milling around in this backwater town, made more famous for its clumps of missile silos, are The Borg out to thwart history for their own means. The Borg make for poor enemies; they shuffle, zombie-like, around corridors and terrains wielding large guns they cannot properly use – rarely do they strike us as the advanced and all-conquering beings we're told they are, and how they managed to navigate things so well during that opening space dogfight in their successful battling all those Federation ships is beyond me. They are led by a character played by Alice Krige, who aims for imposing and empowered, but just comes across a more of a character eventually rejected from Roger Vadim's sci-fi disaster Barbarella. Mirroring what Nimoy pulled off on two occasions, Jonathan Frakes plays boss of the piece in his role as the director whilst navigating being the second fiddle on screen to his Captain. The film is not particularly well directed, with this sense of things feeling as if they're advancing, what with the threat levels being what they are and what's at stake being what it is, without anything actually progressing. Additionally, not once do we really feel that Earth is this scene of post-global war fallout and is struggling to get by; the sets striking us as precisely that – the film has a hollow 'stagey' feel to it.Often in these sorts pictures, one's lead is defined to be suffering some deep emotional trauma and must undergo a rigorous quest detailed within the film so as to undo it; in this case, Picard's conquering of his fear of The Borg and setting records straight. Such a sentiment will sound bland and terribly Hollywoodised, but the suggestion is most certainly there via the opening scenes, items eventually rendered misdemeanours; mere 'shock' sequences designed to pull you in from the beginning while systematically establish The Borg's nature in what is a crude approach. There transpires not to be any greater extent of a study of combating one's demons as was evident in 1994's previous entry, a film making a case study of grief involving that of the aforementioned Picard and a nemesis. The film settles down into being a strange mesh between that of Cameron's 1986 film Aliens and Star Trek's own fourth entry The Voyage Home; the former more exciting without itself uprooting any trees and the latter possessing the same director/actor dynamic but being the more economic Star Trek entry.",Star Trek - First Contact
39,filipemanuelneto,Another good movie for the franchise...,7,3 April 2017,"This movie is the eighth of the franchise. It has two great points: the excellent performance of Patrick Stewart and an interesting and entertaining script that shows us how was the first contact of the human race with beings from another planet, as well as the way the Warp engine was invented. The film moves between drama and comedy in a very elegant and pleasant way, with some well-thought-out humor and excellent dramatic scenes. The use of good special effects and CGI brightened the movie without losing focus. There are many sci fi movies that get all the special effects available and forget the story, but that did not happen here. Stewart was exceptional, probably getting one of his best performances in the role of Captain Picard. James Cromwell gave birth to Warp's father, Zefram Cochran, who appears to be some sort of rebel and alcoholic scientist. I confess that I enjoyed the performance of the actor but, in fact, I couldn't like his character.",Star Trek - First Contact

And it killed this movie.If the Borg could go back in time, why not do this previously? Why not do it all the time, and why not go further back in time to a few billion years back?Also, if time travel was possible, then different timelines would be created, rather than change the one that they are in currently. In other words, if I went back in time and killed my father before I was born, I would still be alive in the current timeline.

Great thoughts on historical legacies, philosophical questions about autonomy, patience and beauty in the space fights, and maybe my favorite villain in all of Star Trek.",Star Trek - First Contact
42,funkyfry,unoriginal concept salvaged by good execution -- fantasy not sci-fi,6,13 November 2007,"As a long-time Star Trek fan who nevertheless didn't warm up to either series until ""The Next Generation"" moved into its 2nd and 3rd seasons, I give this movie a recommendation, but with some personal reservations.It's a decent action film and probably appeals to the casual audience more than any other film in the series outside of ""The Voyage Home."" The Borg Queen is a popular villainess, and for good reasons  the FX were outstanding and Alice Krige's performance is sexy and appropriately intimidating. The time travel theme is a sci-fi theme that audiences are familiar with and that presents opportunities for anachronistic humor that are irresistible. James Crowmell is a magnificent actor with charisma to spare, and even those unfamiliar with Captain Picard will find Patrick Stewart's performance convincing and intriguing. He's been given an excellent foil from the past, Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard), who brings out a lot of dimension in Picard and goes a long way towards helping anyone who hasn't seen previous Trek outings to see what distinguishes Picard and his crew from your generic space soldiers (they are ""Roddenberry People""). In fact the introduction of a ""normal"" character into the fantasy environment is a key component of successful fantasy storytelling; this device is discussed in J.R.R. Tolkien's essay ""On Faerie Stories"" and was used by Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as well as many who followed after them. It should be noted however that it's a fantasy theme or device, not science fiction.The film isn't as impressive for those who are already familiar with the Trek world and who expected (or at least hoped) the Next-Generation movies would take the universe and its characters into uncharted frontiers. The original series didn't really develop its characters, only focused on 3 primary characters and kept those characters and their relationships constant through the 3 season run. In the Original Series (TOS) films, however, Kirk Spock and McCoy go through a series of character developments that alter their personal stories while keeping their relationship mostly intact. Strangely, the situation is reversed for Next Generation (TNG)  the series paid attention to a larger group of crew members and spent a lot of time developing those characters and their relationships (Worff dated Troi, Data turned out to have a twin brother and met his creator, etc.). However when TNG went to film virtually all character development was abandoned. Part of the problem is unavoidable to a certain extent  after all, there are simply too many characters involved to give each of them screen time and still advance an interesting plot. But I wish that they had tried a little harder to incorporate actual sci-fi ideas instead of just turning the series into another action franchise cloaked in sci-fi costumes and set pieces. Many steps backward have been taken  the Borg no longer have a truly alien collective mind but are instead drones led by a Queen Bee type. As much fun as the Borg Queen is, she doesn't represent any new interesting ideas about the Borg and wouldn't be out of place in any action film out there. Also there is a lot of repetition here  the time travel story feels familiar from ""The Voyage Home"" and of course the Borg have already been seen many times in episodes of the show. I've never understood why the producers at Paramount kept thinking that they needed to recycle stories from the shows, especially after the negative fan reaction to ""VGER"" in the first film. It's boring for the fans. So it's impossible for me to really give an ""objective"" reaction to this film, seeing as I've already been exposed to so much of the material in its original form when it was actually better done.I also think that the sequence outside the ship with the deflector dish didn't work out very well, much too slow and improbable. Why did the Borg die when Picard let all that green stuff out of the big tube but they were fine walking along in space without suits? Stuff like that is probably stuff that the writers intentionally don't worry about and think that fans are too petty  but basically what they've done is to turn sci-fi into fantasy. And it's somewhat insulting to our intelligence. On the commentary, the writers say that fans don't want to hear about how time travel works and so they just make it really easy for the Enterprise to travel in time after the Borg. As far as I'm concerned, that underestimates the audience greatly and it's indicative of the reasons why this film feels so unintelligent and uninspired.But not to be totally negative  even from a fan perspective the James Cromwell is a fun character and does provide a subtle kind of tribute in that certain aspects of his character remind us of Gene Roddenberry himself. What made Roddenberry's series so different from previous sci-fi was that he presented us a utopic world that we'd all love to explore, but he peopled it with believably flawed human beings. Woodard's character is also very well done and the scene in the Captain's quarters (""this far and no further!"") was a stunner to be sure. I loved how she said ""Jean-Luc, blow up the damn ship!"" The Borg Queen herself was very well done if you ignore the fact that it damages the concept of the Borg collective itself. The space battle at the beginning is very nice to look at, as is the sequence with the camera's eye drawing back from Picard's Borg eye to reveal the whole ship. But for this fan, I couldn't escape the feeling of ""been there, seen that."" However, from another perspective, looking at how poorly the subsequent films and TV series turned out, this film represents basically the last quality Star Trek product ever produced. So it deserves at least some affection simply on that basis.",Star Trek - First Contact
43,FiendishDramaturgy,"First Contact; a quirky, odd, and sometimes weak best installment",8,25 October 2003,"While this is not as solid as its predecessors, this is the first of the series in which the Next Generation attempts to stand on its own. After the shaky start that was ""Generations,"" this looks great in comparison.Based on several episodes of the ""Next Generation"" television series in which Piccard was assimilated by the Borg, and fought his way free. You are not given the benefit of this knowledge or experience in this installment. They elude to it, and even mention it, but they fail to discuss it which in my opinion is a necessity for you to get a good bead on the events and Piccard's passions concerning the Borg.In the opening scene, they have DATA stealing Spock's lines and that really just did not sit well with me. It was a cheap, slip-shod attempt to endear him to the fans of the old series in Spock's place; a place, which I may add, that he will never in a million years be able to fill. I can appreciate his character for what it is, but not as a replacement for any of the original crew members, let alone Spock.And...Enterprise E? What happened to C and D? It was B which was destroyed in 7 (Generations). So...what happened? Did someone just forget the alphabet? Or did they not care enough about continuity to bother with it?Above that, the Borg have found a way to create a rip in time, in order to go back to 20th century Earth, assimilate the planet, and prevent the human race from achieving warp speed; an event which effectuates mankind's first contact with the Vulcan race, sent to welcome humans into the group of beings who heretofore have not enjoyed the capacity for interstellar travel.Meanwhile, the Borg have infested the Enterprise and are in the process of assimilating Star Fleet's top crew; Jordi La Forge has a new set of eyes which are beautifully and creatively designed; we learn a lot about the functionality of the holodeck, the Borg, and the way some features work aboard the Enterprise E; DATA is given human skin by the Borg (and then given something else which is much more effective in controlling even the mind of a machine); the inventor of the warp drive takes off running for the hills after being overwhelmed by the Enterprise crew's hero worship and has to be captured and returned to the project; the Borg devise a way to send for reinforcements after their ship is destroyed; and Dr. Crusher kidnaps the warp drive project head in an attempt to save her life.All in all, the story itself is well written, and the acting on behalf of the thespians is good, solid and even rousing. There are some holes, as I have pointed out, but for the most part, the story works and is a deserving addition (and perhaps the best NG installment) to this franchise.It rates an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Star Trek - First Contact
44,freemantle_uk,A Trek film that can please fans and non-fans,8,14 August 2016,"Star Trek: First Contact is often considered to be one of the best Star Trek films and the best films featuring The Next Generation cast. This statement is justified because as someone who has never watched any Star Trek involving the TNG cast it does stand alone side the best 'Trek' films.Star Trek: First Contact is set six years after Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) had been rescued from the Borg and he is stilled plagued with nightmares and flashbacks. Now the Borg have started to invade the Federation and the battle is only won by the Enterprise's late intervention. However the Borg have a trick up the sleeve and travel back in time to conquer Earth. The Enterprise crew is unaffected and it is up to them to travel back to stop the Borg conquest and help the legendary Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) who achieved the first wrap flight and made contact with an alien race.Like 'Wrath of Khan' 'First Contact' was a continuation of a critically acclaimed episode, but even if you haven't seen it 'First Contact' works on its own terms and finds that sweet spot to appeal to fans and non-fans alike and matching the two tones the franchise has straddled, dark and brooding and light-hearted and funny. The film has with a dark image of Picard being assimilated into the Borg and his eye about to drilled before waking up and all the half of the film that features the Borg is the most atmospheric. The Borg are great villains, a near unstoppable hive a races that have been conquered, a collective that all linked together who work as one unit.Picard's assimilation with the Borg is both an advantage and disadvantage. Picard knows how the Borg operates and their tactics, so knows how to fight them, but he desire for revenge make Picard irrational. It's like Khan who could have been free after capturing the Enterprise in 'Wrath of Khan' but his want for revenge against Kirk is his downfall. Stewart gave a passionate speech about not sacrificing the Enterprise to the Borg.The Borg's assimilation of the Enterprise makes for a dark and dank atmosphere compared to the more brightly lit environments of the Enterprise. It is this sector of the film where we saw the Borg Queen (Alice Krige), the voice and personification of the Borg collective. Her introduction was impressive, her human body being lowered into a cybernetic body, CGI effects that still hold up today. Most of the Borg Queen's interactions are with Data (Brent Spiner), trying to convince him to join the collective, making him more human to attractive this.The cliché perspective of Star Trek from non-fans is that it a slow, boring franchise that only appeals to a hardcore fanbase. ""First Contact"" blows that perspective out of the water - it starts with a huge space battle between the Federation and the Borg as the alien hive try to invade Earth and there are sprinklings of actions scenes throughout the film. One of the best is scene when three members of the Enterprise crew having to stop the Borg from creating a satellite dish - it was a tense scene that was similar to the assassination of the Klingon Chancellor in ""The Undiscovered Country"".The action on Earth where Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) help Cochran with the first warp flight is more lighter in tone. The more comedic approach combined with the time travel story, cultural clash and essentially revealing the future to Cochrane made this half of film similar to ""The Voyage Home"". Cochrane is hailed a hero by everyone in the Federation, a man whose action united Earth, made a scientific breakthrough and made his planet a player in galactic politics but the reality was he was a drunk, he wanted to make money and is overwhelmed by finding out what his future holds. It made the character more human as he has to accept his destiny and James Cromwell, being the professional that he is was brilliant at humanising the character as he drunkenly dances and having the deal with the weight on his shoulders.""First Contact"" is a film that works for both fans and non-fans alike, having action, being able to balance a dark plot with lighter moments and working as a continuation and a standalone film, being a strong sci-fi film in its own right.",Star Trek - First Contact
45,ebiros2,One of the best Star Trek movie,6,18 August 2011,"Star Trek movies have been a hit or miss proposition in terms of quality (General opinion being that even numbered ones are better than the odd numbered ones), and true to form, this gem of Star Trek movie falls on an even number.Star Trek First Contact in my opinion is one of the best Star Trek movie made. The CG scenes are beautiful, and Enterprise never looked better on screen. Story had meat to it as it took on first contact - actually the first contact took place between the future humans and the 21st century humans before the Vulcans came. So there were two first contacts in this movie. The other half is the deep contact with the Borg queen. There are lot of points of interest in this movie, that makes this one of the best Star Trek movie. The down side is the spotty directing by Jonathan Frakes , and shoddy acting by James Cromwell as Zefrem Cochrane. There seems to be no connection between this character and the character that appeared in Star Trek TOS. Over humanizing of Cochrane didn't work in my opinion, and took away the believability that he was the genius that he was supposed to be. The camp that people lived in also had WTF factor to it. People living like native Americans from 18th century would be difficult to believe they'd be working on a warp technology, or that Cochrane would be doing it for money. Who would have the money to buy his technology in a decimated world ?So, there were some spottiness to the story, and production, but overall the movie had the feel of Star Trek to the story which makes this my favorite Star Trek movies.",Star Trek - First Contact
46,JoeB131,Being the best TNG film...,4,17 March 2009,"...is really like being the Leper with the most fingers.Yes, First Contact lacks the awfulness that were Generations, Insurrection and Nemesis. And there are some good performances here.TNG was never the strongest Trek series. The original and Deep Space Nine were better. It did have the most likable cast, however, and it was always a joy to see them. The problem here, like all the TNG films, is that most of the drama focuses on Picard and Data, without the other characters getting a chance to shine.My other huge complaint with the film is that it assumes gross incompetence on the part of the Enterprise crew to get the story moving. Well, we have to lose half our ship (and crew) to the Borg before we actually start taking action against them. It was the kind of ineptitude we saw on Voyager and Enterprise week after week that drove the fans nuts. Thanks, Braga, you've done so much to cripple the franchise.Another sign that Braga is an idiot. In the first treatment, he wanted to make Zephram Cochran a woman because a)He was too stupid to realize Zephram was a guy's name, and 2) He hadn't realized that ZC had already been seen in the Original Series, which he never watched because it actually relied on things like character development and story.

47,Jackbv123,The moment Sci-Fi buffs dream about,9,24 August 2017,"This movie spent a lot of time making fun of the idol-worship of Zefram Cochran as the man who changed history. Yet this is exactly how those who love Sci-Fi, and many more who love space exploration, feel while hoping for that moment (impossible as it may be) when a person from our Earth travels faster than light. I venture to say that like me, many have pictured themselves in that role and in all that would follow it, including the possibility that it would bring about a first contact with an alien species. So who among us can resist a movie about this very thing. True, the movie diluted the moment of achieving FTL with the simultaneous battle on the Enterprise. It chose instead to celebrate the moment of first contact with pomp and emotional music. Perhaps that is more appropriate.The movie had some great acting from several people. The tension between Lilly and Picard was excellent. Patrick Stewart delivered some great lines during Picard's confrontation with Lilly. Stewart would go on soon after this to play Ahab on TV. Frakes direction was solid although as Riker he seemed to have that grin of his a few times too many.

52,Enchorde,One of the best Star Trek movies,8,19 March 2011,"Star Trek has always spoken to me, being set in the future with seemingly limitless options and a almost magical technology. But in First Contact the crew of the Enterprise set out to stop a Borg attack on earth in their own past, our near future, where the legendary Zefram Cochrane is just about to launch the first human built warp-capable spaceship. This the Borg is intent to stop, opening up the Earth for Borg conquest. Only Picard and his crew stand in their way. But Cochrane isn't as his legend tells him to be, and Picard must also deal with a Borg infestation on Enterprise.Despite not being set in its own time, but the near future, First Contact is one of my Star Trek favorites. With the movie almost divided into two subplots, the race to finish Cochrane's ship and the fight against the Borg, the movie contains both what is best with Star Trek. The sense of exploration and pure sci-fi action. And Frakes, in his role as director, handles the two plots very well. They interact without getting in each other's way, which is the tricky part. First Contact is simply entertaining from beginning to end.A key part is the cast. The crew of the Enterprise is very good as always, but it is almost Cromwell's depiction of the legendary Cochrane that makes the movie. One of the best anti-heroes I ever seen and a role that gives both depth and humor to the story.If you seen much Star Trek before, knowing the history will help, but I think First Contact might also be a good first step into the Star Trek world.8/10",Star Trek - First Contact
53,Agent10,One of the best in the series,8,12 May 2002,"Sadly, this movie going experience was rather tainted by an idiot who kept stating the obvious things throughout the movie. However, I did like this film quite a bit. It probably had the best ensemble characters the series has ever had. Alice Krige, James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard were all exceptional in this film, and the crew acted rather well. However, the downside of the film was the fact the crew members emulated Zefram way too much, which brought about a silly tribute-type picture. However, the anti-gravity action scene was exceptional, especially when Worf just starts beating everyone up. A good edition to the series.",Star Trek - First Contact
54,davidmvining,"Star Trek goes action movie and does it well, never to look back",8,22 November 2019,"The Next Generation's first solo adventure went a similar route to The Wrath of Khan. Eschewing the weird aspects of the previous film (including a very television B plot), they embraced the idea of a single adventure with multiple facets that feed into each other.The Borg are heading for Earth, and the new Enterprise E's crew is being held on the sidelines. Captain Picard, six years earlier, was captured and assimilated into the cybernetic collective before being rescued. His presence in an engagement with the Borg would present an ""unstable element"", so they must patrol the Neutral Zone with the Romulans. The attack begins and Picard goes against orders to fly in and save the day. Except that the Borg have a plan B, going into Earth's past to assimilate the population before they became such a threat. The Enterprise, of course, follows them, and we have our adventure.The story is built on a series of contradistinctions that make the whole film really interesting from beginning to end. Picard was assimilated by the Borg, which makes him the best person to fight them. The Borg try to assimilate the android, Data, but in order to do that they must go against their normal process. They normally take organic lifeforms and make them mechanical. With Data, they must take a mechanical man and make him more organic. Zephram Cochran, the man from the past who piloted humanity's first faster than light vessel, is nothing like the history books have written him to be. And, the most interesting, Picard, the evolved man from the 24th century succumbs to a sensibility driven by little more than revenge.Back in my review for The Undiscovered Country, I noted that the series has a literary streak that I really like. That continues in First Contact when Picard, near the end of his resistance to the Borg aboard his ship, quiets down after an outburst and quotes from Moby Dick. It's the second movie in the franchise to directly quote from Melville's masterpiece (the first being, of course, The Wrath of Khan), but the purpose is directly opposite to the first instance. Khan uses Ahab's words as his final words in an effort to kill the object of his quarry. Picard uses a description of Ahab strapped to the white whales' body as a moment of reflection to see where his vengeance will take him.Listening to Ronald D. Moore, one of the writers of the movie, talk about Picard is really interesting. He seems to have found some of the restrictions of syndicated television limiting, especially in terms of character. You can only take a character so far in 44 minutes, especially when he has to be completely back to normal the very next episode. In a movie, though, you're allowed to push characters further and even imply that they're not the same at the end more forcefully. And that's exactly what he did with Picard here. It's the sort of thing that would have pissed of Gene Roddenberry if he had lived to see it. In Roddenberry's mind, people essentially stopped being people in the 24th century. They weren't prone to prejudices or notions of things so base as revenge. Moore disagreed and sent Picard down the rabbit hole, and it's so satisfyingly done.The contrast with Picard is Data. Data isn't a man, but an android yearning to become more human. For a time, he's tempted by the idea of becoming more physically human through the skin grafts that the Borg queen provides him (wherever did she find a bunch of human skin lying around?). In a sense, both Picard and Data are becoming more human through the experience of fighting the Borg. Picard embraces his more base instincts while Data learns physical sensation.The B-plot in the movie, part of the crew remaining on Earth to help Zephram Cochran clean up from the Borg attack and launch his warp ship on time, is done much better than the B-plot in Generations. It actually has something to do with the plot on the ship, and it also acts as a thematic pair with Picard. As Picard becomes more like the people of the mid-21st century (angry, even cruel), we see Cochran learn of his own future, and he simply can't believe it. The crew keep telling him about the statues, high schools, and text book chapters named after him. They quote speeches he'll give in a decade. It all sounds like it's about a completely different person than him, a drunk who hates flying and wants to retire to an island full of naked women. His experience with warp flight and the eventual first contact with the ""good guy"" alien race at the end of the film doesn't make him a 24th century man, but it does put him on the path.On top of that, the movie is the best looking movie since The Motion Picture. It's the first movie since the first one that feels like it doesn't have a compromised budget.The only thing that I find frustrating about the movie is simply how much expository dialogue there is. Especially through the first half of the film, it feels like scene after scene of people explaining things to each other. It's handled about as well as you can handle such scenes, so the exposition is less grating than in something like the Star Wars prequels. It still kind of grates on me, though.Still, the movie has a series argument for being a top 3 of the entire franchise.",Star Trek - First Contact
55,RatedVforVinny,Highly rated by the loyal followers.,7,11 December 2019,"I so way prefer the original Star Trek crew but 'The Next Generation' and following movies have their own supporters. Compared to the very latest films bearing the most famous name (bar Star Wars), this is indeed favourable. A tight script, decent acting and an involving story. Kind of leaves me a bit cold and I'm not a huge Sci-fi lover, so much of this will just blow over (the top of my head). Watched in the cinema on initial release and found the space battles relatively exciting.",Star Trek - First Contact
56,Movie-ManDan,"The Best ""Next Generation"" Star Trek Movie.",10,23 March 2015,"First Contact and Wrath of Khan are easily the two best Star Trek movies. The best movies just happen to be sequels of their respected shows. These are easily better than these new reboots with Chris Pine. Sure they're enjoyable, but this is real Star Trek! Even if I wasn't a fanatic, I would still find the reboots to be much inferior to all the original Star Trek movies. Is this better than Wrath of Khan? That is debatable. If not better than Wrath of Khan, then slightly behind it. I'm on the fence with this, they are both equal to me.First Contact focuses on revenge and time travel, two generic themes that are played about perfectly. The Borg return and assimilate Earth by altering the past--the day before mankind's first contact with aliens. Captain Picard (Stewart) is dead-set on destroying the Borg by any means after he himself was assimilated in an earlier episode of the series. Riker, Geordi and Troi (Frakes, Burton, Sirtis) stay on Earth to help an engineer (Cromwell) follow through with his plans of being the first to create a spaceship that can travel faster than the stars while keeping an eye out for any Borg that may come to Earth. The bits of the Enterprise on Earth is nice and funny. Cromwell is a drunk who can't relate to the people of the future. Meanwhile on the enterprise, the Borg try to assimilate it, succeeding in some moments. The Borg is dark and freaky looking, making their takeover on the Enterprise somewhat modern-day Gothic. It is very hellacious and violent, but a ton of fun. When they realize the ship must be destroyed, Picard wants to follow through with the destruction of the Borg. Picard mirrors Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, and he would play the character just two years later. The Borg have even kidnapped Data (Spiner) and are doing a good job in making him one of their own. The Enterprise bears almost no chance of defeating the Borg. Near impossible victories are what I love. Of course the good guys win, but it's very exciting to see how they do it.4/4",Star Trek - First Contact
57,Kamurai25,"""Time Trek: Bad Contact""",6,23 October 2020,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend (at least for dedicated ""Star Trek"" fans).My favorites aspects of all of ""Star Trek"" are The Borg, and the artificial entities like Data. This movie potentially ruins both of them, depending on who you ask. Also, time travel is the worst.I would have been much happier if we hadn't bothered with time travel as that creates a lot of other questions about why The Borg haven't utilized it before if they had such technology.The investigation of humanity in The Borg and Data are pretty interesting though, seeing Data find what it is to FEEL is a great, but seeing The Borg personified into a single entity to which one can converse is odd, at best.Seeing the Enterprise defend against Borg assault was fun, but none of the ""First Contact"" stuff was compelling at all.",Star Trek - First Contact
58,brando647,My Favorite TREK Adventure...Resistance is Futile...,9,8 January 2011,"I know I'm biased about this, but FIRST CONTACT remains my favorite adventure of the franchise (though the J.J. Abrams 2009 reinvention of the original series is a close second). After suffering through the plot requirements of GENERATIONS, series writers Brannon Braga and Ronald Moore were given free reign to design the story for the eighth film in the series. The action and adventure are the best of any Next Generation film and the techno-babble, torturous to non-fans, is kept to a minimum. The Borg, cybernetic beings intent on assimilating all cultures into their own, have reached Earth and travel into the past to 2063. Their mission is to prevent Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from making the first warp flight and establishing first contact with an alien race, thereby setting into motion the eventual creation of the Federation. The Enterprise-E follows them into the past and Picard (Patrick Stewart) must leads his crew in a battle to regain his assimilated ship from the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) and confront his desire for revenge against the race of beings that once robbed him of his individuality.Why am I biased in favor of this film? One word: Borg. The Borg were one of my favorite adversaries from the Next Generation television series (second only to Q, who sadly will probably never be seen in a TREK film). Their unified consciousness and technological superiority made them nearly unstoppable and there is something inherently creepy about a race of faceless drones who only seek to accomplish their one task: assimilation of all cultures. Their creepiness is put into full effect here with fantastically updated makeup effects enhancing their seemingly undead, mechanical appearance. Jonathan Frakes (Commander William Riker as well as first-time feature director) does a great job and seems to take cues from movies like ALIEN as Picard and his crew hunt through the Borg-ified Enterprise. It's got a definite horror vibe for the Borg portion of the plot and it's supported with the freaky (albeit sexy) performance of Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. She oozes confidence and sexuality as she attempts to seduce Data (Brent Spiner...yes, she's seducing the android...) and convince him to join her as an equal.While the Borg invasion of the Enterprise is my favorite portion of the movie, there is still an entertaining secondary story playing out on Earth's surface (Montana, to be precise) where Riker and his away team assist soon-to-be-famous Zefram Cochrane in repairing his warp ship and continuing to make first contact with the Vulcans. James Cromwell is awesome as Cochrane and we discover that history's heroes aren't always what we expect. He's a belligerent alcoholic who created the warp ship for his own greedy desires and he's not too keen on learning that he's practically worshiped centuries into the future. There's a great comedy moment in the film where Cochrane has gotten Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis, looking better than ever) drunk on tequila and she unloads on Riker how difficult it is to interact with such a ""primitive culture"". On the topic of comedy in the film, I'm happy to report that Data's toned back on his emotion hijinks a lot and, while he still has the emotion chip he installed in GENERATIONS, he's no longer singing to computers and talking to tricorders. Spiner is so much better in this film, which is good considering he's a major player in the Borg plot and gets plenty of screen time. It's also great to see Patrick Stewart letting loose with his angry side as he goes nuts on the Borg, driven by revenge and unable to cope with the fact that he might lose the Enterprise to them.Of all the pre-Abrams TREK films, this is the most approachable from those who aren't necessarily die-hard fans. It doesn't shove techno-babble down your throat and it gives you enough information that even those new to the series will follow what's going on. It's exciting, suspenseful, and at times funny; I can't think of a single moment where I found myself bored with the film. It's definitely the best Next Generation adventure and it's a great into film to those who want a taste of the STAR TREK series.",Star Trek - First Contact
59,mike48128,My Favorite Star Trek Movie of All Time! Love that Evil Borg Queen,10,12 August 2017,"Although the ""rebooted"" movie series is not over (yet) this still remains my best-loved Star Trek Movie to date, but I also have to include the 2 part episode ""Best of Both Worlds"", as a runner-up from Star Trek:TNG TV series. What is so fascinating about the Borg? Certainly their ""Frankensteinish"" appearance and Borg Queen which has also appeared with ""7 of 9"" in ""Voyager"" as well. (Actress Alice Krige won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Borg Queen in the movie.) She apparently likes mating with humans and Data as well. Capt. Picard still has a link with the Borg Queen as she almost turns Data into a real human being (like Pinocchio) and that's the 2 illogical things about this film. Borgs try to rewrite history so that Dr. Cochran never launches the first warp-drive prototype and meets The Vulcan spaceship, hence the title ""First Contact"" with aliens for Mankind. Lots of hand-to-hand combat on 21th Century Earth and 24th Century Enterprise. As always, it is almost self-destructed as in other films. Capt.Picard is compared to ""Capt. Ahab pursuing Moby Dick"" with the Borg as the prey, in this case. The film manages to cover all the details including Geordi's enhanced new eyes (from Borg technology) to the Holodeck ""Speakeasy"". Very few, if any, ""errors"" in the plot. Most of the computer generated ships and effects look quite real considering that this is from 1996. So well scanned that I waited years before buying a disc copy. A great space-walk on the hull of the ship and the usual great interiors. The ""curse of the red shirts"" continues as all of the assimilated humans are new ""recruits"". As I have mentioned before, why is there never a reference for the creation of The Borg, which happened when ""Commander Decker ""joined"" with an electronic entity in ""Star Trek:The Motion Picture""?",Star Trek - First Contact

62,KUAlum26,Arguably one of--if not THE--most compelling of the Trek films,9,19 February 2008,"With the exception of Star Trek:The Motion Picture(for which I've yet to see more than a half hour of),I've seen all of the Movies based on the wildly popular (to put it MILDLY) TV Series,and I have to say that this movie has to be clearly one of the most entertaining and compelling of the bunch.INtroduced in season two of ST:TNG,and the subject of a season three cliffhanger,the Borg have returned, and nobody feels a more personal investment or haunting than Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart,in a word:great!). He and his crew are assessed (partly through his own doing) with the massive responsibility of fending off the species AND allowing for the first warp-drive flight of legendary space travel pioneer Dr.Zephram Cochrane (James Cromwell,in his first ""good guy"" performance post-""Babe""). Director Jonathan Frakes,for whom I wish would direct more stuff,preferably stuff NOT Sci-Fi oriented(because I like his technique with allowing actors to talk and react as much as fill the screen with dizzying action and FRX sequences),is able to skillfully guide this effort that is penned by Gene Roddenberry-disciple Rick Berman. The result is a film that is by turns thrilling,intelligent,ironic,gentle,noble,funny and even majestic,though the last part could be as much a result of the underrated score by longtime composer Jerry Goldsmith. Skillful performances by Stewart,Brent Spiner(1996 was a VERY good year for him:not one,not two,but three blockbusters: ST:FC,Independence Day and a nice cameo in the John Travolta weeper Phenomenon),Alfre Woodward(as Cochrane's friend and apprentice)and Alice Krige(as the deliciously seductive and suspiciously individualistic Borg Queen)highlight this film,augmented by a ""Gang's all here"" supplement of regulars Marina Sirtis,Frakes,GAtes McFAdden,LaVar Burton and Michael Dorn.I won't be one to categorically crown this film the best of the Trek movies,but I will say that this is probably the crown jewel of the series(which has been in mothballs since 2002's coolly received ""Star Trek:Nemesis"" and hopes to get that shot in the arm with J.J.Abrams' prequel offering set to run this year)and,paired with ""The Wrath of Khan"" and ""The Voyage Home"",ranks as a must-see in the cinematic invitations to ""Boldly go"".",Star Trek - First Contact

65,sarastro7,Growing into a genre classic,10,18 December 2006,"When I saw First Contact in theaters originally, I wasn't too impressed. It all seemed too pretentious to me, esp. the parts about the Borg queen and Data's emotions, and their sexual innuendo. Those parts still seem pretentious and nonsensical to me. But this kind of superficiality is as good as it gets in current-day movie sci-fi, so we had better learn to like it.And I *have* learned to like it. Most of the movie is so intense, so action-filled and so well-acted that it is a joy to behold. Many characters - of course especially Patrick Stewart and Alfre Woodard - are fiercely emotional and distressed to the point of impaired judgment. It's a brilliant portrayal of the characters. Great actors, great screenplay.I don't think it's possible to make a Star Trek movie that is better than the hilariously brilliant Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home. And I also have a soft spot for the first movie, the Motion Picture, which was really more sci-fi than it was typical Star Trek (and this is a good thing). But apart from those, First Contact is clearly the best Trek movie. It is, uncharacteristically, an example of both Star Trek *and* science fiction at its very best, and it's a movie worthy of many, many repeated viewings. It's becoming a true and classy science fiction classic.9 out of 10.",Star Trek - First Contact
66,vip_ebriega,"Phasers set for ""fun"".",7,23 March 2007,"My Take: A good-old 'Star Trek' adventure. (This is an extension of the review I wrote in March 2007)I liked STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT the first time I saw it, but I really didn't make a big deal out of it. I wasn't exactly a Trekkie, and up to today, I'm not exactly a keen follower. But having seen the new STAR TREK, I was interested about Roddenberry's universe that I just have to see all the movies again, this included. Since its even considered the best STAR TREK movie ever (Even voting it above WRATH OF KHAN and THE VOYAGE HOME, arguably my favorite movies in the series), perhaps I will be able to appreciate FIRST CONTACT even more this time, with a larger interest in the field. Is it the best STAR TREK ever? Not exactly, but trekkie or not, every praise for FIRST CONTACT states truth. Superb acting , impressive special effects, and a story with enough wonder and action to hold non-fans' attention. Resistance is definitely futile! The story tells of the Next Generation Enterprise crew going up against a horde of creatures called the Borg, who plans to obliterate the Earth's history by preventing First Contact (man's first encounter with an alien race, ending Earth's 'primitive' age). Jean Luc-Picard (Patrick Stewart) bears a grudge with the Borg, led by a seductive empress (Alice Krige), since he once feel in their grasps. Of the four TNG feature films, FIRST CONTACT is probably and unanimously the best. Like any great science-fiction movie, it combines its spaced-out action and special effects (an early space dogfight, several wild shoot-outs with the Borg) with a strong story (time-travel, one of STAR TREK's specialties) filled with interesting characters (James Cromwell's misfit scientist) and ideas. Still an enjoyable sci-fi adventure for non-fans and a minor classic for Trekkies. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Star Trek - First Contact
67,phubbs,Star Trek: First Contact,6,26 January 2015,"Second film (or sequel?) for the next generation crew and this time there is no hint of the classic crew what so ever, its all new now baby.So this next Trek rumble is a lot more straight forward plot wise and probably has the most action seen for awhile. Quite simply the Borg are on the rampage and out to assimilate pretty much everyone they can, namely all of Starfleet. This goes a little pear shaped for them so they jump through time to assimilate the entire Earth...the naughty rascals. Is time travel a regular function for everyone in the Trek universe? handy if so.I liked this film for the simplicity of everything and the fact you get some basic action mixed with some genuine tension along with the insecurity of not knowing what may happen, seeing as its the Borg. Bottom line there are plenty of deaths or assimilation's (close enough), a decent baddie, some good back story to Earth's future and plenty of phaser action. Its not exactly a top notch sci-fi action flick lets be honest here, this is no Die Hard in space. Visually most things still have that TV show quality only on a slightly grander scale. Everything looks a bit plastic amongst the obvious plastic sets.Effects again are more CGI based than models unfortunately. The space battle against the big Borg cube ship thing at the start actually looks like a video game sequence, obvious CGI without weight or depth. I know this is still only 96 but geez you'd think they could do better, compare this to Star Wars! The deadly Borg look quite decent with some good facial makeup but their cyborg body armour, weapons and general body attachments do look pretty rubbery and plastic.I really don't know who decided to put silly little flashing lights all over the shop, it just makes everything look so childish and fake. Data again suffers with this indignity, when his android under layers are revealed it just appears to be bare grey plastic with stupid flashing fairy lights all over, so very crap looking.As for the bad guys I do like them, space zombies if you will, lets face it that's what they are really. Part robotic and part organic space zombies from the planet Romero. I do like the Borg as they do actually come across as creepy plus they manage to add real tension and dread to a Star Trek film. Can't really over look the fact they are a mixture of various ideas from various other sci-fi/horror films all pieced together ('Hellraiser' springs to mind). Plus the fact that they transform whole areas into cold dead robotic hives that visually appear the same as the Borg themselves kinda copies ideas used in 'Aliens' but hey ho.Apart from that the Borg are quite a cool creation and do actually add a genuine threat to the Star Trek universe. Yet at the same time they kinda don't fit in the Trek universe, they're almost too cold, calculated and merciless for the family friendly franchise. Not sure I ever really liked the design of their ship (I guess its a ship), why is it merely a large cube? what's the deal with that? On a final note why are they called Borg? are they Swedish?The Borg queen is a nice touch to the faceless enemy that does come across as an interesting character, not just a cyborg on auto pilot. She also has some really good prosthetic makeup on the face and chest regions, looks that bit more realistic than the other drones.A definite improvement over the last rather dull film, a basic story which is more savage and quite dark in places, although not too extreme of course. I did notice this is another film where actually having some knowledge of a previous TV episode/s is slightly required. They got away with it for 'Star Trek II' and I believe they got away with it for this film also, but seeing that particular episode would appear to help when watching this film.6/10",Star Trek - First Contact
68,stamper,My second Star Trek film ever,7,10 February 2002,"I must say this Star Trek Series is not as bad as I thought it'd be (mind that I've only watched 2 films yet). This one is very close to being as good as Star Trek Generations, but it somehow fails. There is enough action and comedy throughout and James Cromwell makes a good performance in this film (probably the best of everyone in the film), but there are times at which the film simply does not have enough. I feel that the viewer is not drawn deeply enough in Capt. Picards troubled mind and that at times sequences involving James Cromwell rocking on earth and that Borg collective being mean are not good enough. There is no real villain here and one wonders how creatures that stupid can assimilate whole countries. Well it is pretty good, but it also has it's flaws.

69,The_Movie_Cat,"""The line must be drawn here!""",6,15 February 2001,"If not the best film of the series, then First Contact is certainly the best film starring the Next Generation crew. After the dire Generations - the worst movie in the whole franchise - the previous problems have been greatly improved.It's perhaps a sad fact that, no matter how many films the crew appears in, they will never be as popular as the original, certainly on this side of the Atlantic. There's something about the denizens of the Next Generation that are too smug, too anorakky, and far, far too banal. Rather than the identifiable characters of the sixties, this crew is a group of token weirdoes and narcissists.Major exception to this rule is Patrick Stewart, the RSC actor who gets to practically carry this film, a welcome development. Rather odd that the captain with arguably the most depth should have the most shallow crewmembers. Unless you count Voyager of course, and let's face it, who does? Jonathan Frakes, a man who is more valuable behind the camera than in front of it, has a lessened role. So too do the lacking female crew, including a Marina Sirtis who seems to have forgotten she once had a ""Betazoid"" accent and now talks in broad Cockney. And it's a testament to the producers' lack of faith in Gates McFadden that they cast Alfre Woodard to act as a counterpoint to Picard. This also highlights how sadly missed Whoopee Goldberg is from this encounter.Largest problem for the series is the need to develop the characters, yet not so much that they distance newer audience members. Thankfully, Data's emotion chip is more or less dropped, while Geordi's high-tech contact lenses are unobtrusive.There are still flaws, of course. The vital exposition for casual viewers isn't dealt out before the first fifty minutes, giving non-fans no clue as to who the Borg are, and what First Contact actually is. Yet all of it - including Picard's absorption into the collective - is explained before the duration is over. The Next Gen's somewhat sanitised, brightly-lit surroundings also lend little towards what could have been an effective horror. Woodard at one point describes them as ""bionic zombies"", and a little more Dawn of the Dead homaging could have gone a long way. That said, the Borg's drilling appendages are genuinely frightening, and their catchphrase - ""I hope the Cybermen don't have a good lawyer"", er, I mean, ""you will be assimilated"" - is chilling. The director's nickname of ""Two Takes Frakes"" perhaps indicates the level of complacency involved, though he does chalk up a very exciting scene on the saucer of the Enterprise.First Contact follows the basic format of The Wrath of Khan: action, action and action. No great concepts, no great turns of plot, no lame comedy moments. This is just one non-stop shoot 'em up, with very nice special effects, achieved on a modest $45 million budget. The script isn't exactly witty, but is above average, and takes in references to Mark Twain and Herman Melville.There's the sense that the film never quite replicates the same excitement or sense of foreboding as the better TV Borg episodes, most notably Q Who? and The Best of Both Worlds. And there's also little to distinguish between this and one double-length episode. Despite all this, First Contact emerges as a very worthwhile action/SF thriller, though roped in to long-established internal continuity, the Star Trek films are unlikely ever to achieve classic status in their own right. 6/10.",Star Trek - First Contact

Riker from the Star Trek The Next Generation TV series directs this brilliant film filled with dazzling special effects. This is the 8th film in the Star Trek film series. First Contact is the first film in the franchise to feature no cast members from the original Star Trek television series of the 1960s. After two better known directors turned down the job, cast member Jonathan Frakes was chosen to direct to make sure the task fell to someone who understood Star Trek. The special effects in the film were completed by Industrial Light & Magic in less then five months.Notable scenes: The best scenes in the movie is the opening scene, where we see the inside of a Borg ship, then showing us an assimilated Jean-luc Picard who wakes up from a dream. The destruction of a Borg Cube is also another notable scene. Then there is the zero gravity battle between the Borg and the crew of the enterprise. Data and the Borg Queen: Something new here, a romance between a Cyborg woman and an Android man. Data encounters the Borg Queen for the first time. She is interested in Data to the point that she wants him to be by her side as her mate. He however is curious to experience the sensations the Borg Queen promises to give him. We also see a surgical grafting of skin on Data. A kiss between the two is the highlight.Tequila anyone ??? We see Riker and Troi getting drunk while sharing a bottle of strong tequila while on earth.Pumped up Picard. Picard is shown with his biceps exposed for the first time. He is given a more action oriented role in this film.

Or better still see it in a THX film theater near you.10/10 for visual effects and music, 8/10 for overall plot, 7/10 for overall acting. I have given a high rating of 10 due to special effects and pace of the movie only. I feel the overall acting and plot is not that good. Better plots were of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek: Generations, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.",Star Trek - First Contact
71,TheNorthernMonkee,One of the finest Star Trek films,8,6 September 2004,"SPOILERSSince Roddenberry first came up with the idea of ""Star Trek"" there have been some legendary enemies. Khan Noonian Singh from the original series and 1982's ""The Wrath Of Khan"", the Klingons, the Romulans and the Cardassians are just four of the enemies which different crews in this fictional universe have had to fight against. Perhaps the most fear inducing enemy of them all however, is the Borg. These machine obsessed beings who work as a collective unit of drones have freaked out many a fan over the years and in this eighth film of the series, they take their rightful place as big screen enemies.As he rests aboard the new USS Enterprise NCC 1701-E (One year out of space-dock), Captain Picard is informed of a Borg Cube attacking the Earth. As Picard faces his own demons, he fights to prevent the Borg from destroying humanity's history before it has even happened.Whilst perhaps not as perfect as the previously mentioned ""The Wrath Of Khan"", this film is easily up there amongst the finest of the series. By having the Borg as the enemy in this film, the films producers are able to spend a fortune on special effects, making these creatures as terrifying as possible. Whilst certain races fail to be scary due to the fact that they are so alien, the Borg remind us of how technology can destroy us. The Borg are former humanoids who have evolved to fit technology on their own bodies. This idea that we could actually become a member of this collective by loosing our individuality is an awful prospect and is so imaginable that it is no wonder the Borg scare people.As well as having the ultimate ""Star Trek"" enemy in this film, the reason it works is it has such a huge combination of humour and violence. Whilst aboard the Enterprise we have almost non-stop violence as the crew fight back the attacking Borg, on the Planet Earth we are given a treat in Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) terror at the idol worship he endures. Cochrane, the man responsible for the warp drive, creates the technology for the financial benefit, but when the crew begin to arrive and praise him, we are shown his absolute horror at this constant attention he gets. Cromwell's scientist is the ultimate example of someone who doesn't want any of the celebrity status which they deserve. Cochrane is a difficult role to play and it feels that the part could so easily have gone wrong, but with superb acting by Cromwell and decent direction by Jonathan Frakes (Commander Riker himself), the character is played just right.The final point worth mentioning about ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is that it has the character interaction perfectly. When watching the original crew (Kirk and friends) in the earlier movies, they worked so well because as well as being shipmates, they were close friends. In 1994's ""Star Trek: Generations"", this generation never seemed to really click. It was noticeable that they were friends, but it is only really in this second outing that we begin to experience their free flowing banter. The conversations between Riker, La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Troi (Marina Sirtis) are brilliant because the three make jokes and are laid back together. They get the job done, but they always appear to enjoy each others company. This banter was seriously lacking in the first film and it is a joy to see it in ""Star Trek: First Contact"".So to summarise, it doesn't feel really fair to compare this film with 1982's ""Wrath Of Khan"", or even 1991's ""The Undiscovered Country"", mainly because the two different crews are remarkably different. These three films are easily the finest of the series however and ""First Contact"" is a joy to watch from start to finish. You'll laugh, you'll feel for the crew, and you'll be intimidated by the deadliest enemy the Federation and Earth have ever faced. This film is a must watch.",Star Trek - First Contact

First Contact indeed is on par with the very best of the Star Trek films - The Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country. Unfortunately, they won't get it right again to the present day (with the above average but still not as good Insurrection and awful Nemesis). The script is very solid, the acting above par (with kudos going to Alice Krige as the seductive Borg Queen and Alfre Woodard as the trusting Lily Sloane), and the score by Jerry Goldsmith again another hit.

73,perfectbond,The best Star Trek film yet!,10,4 February 2003,"Star Trek First Contact worked well in all aspects. The premise of the Borg going back in time to conquer the Earth in the past was a truly frightening concept (though what would prevent them from making further attempts I'm not sure). The Borg themselves came across as genuinely formidable foes. All the cast members who portray Picard and his gallant crew were in top form. Even Marina Sirtis' Counsellor Troy was marginally tolerable in this installment. The subplot of the first light speed flight felt interesting and integral and not just tacked on. The costumes, props, and special effects were all top notch for 1996. All in all outstanding entertainment, 9/10.",Star Trek - First Contact
74,thevacinstaller,A safe movie for a franchise that excels when being bold.,6,18 July 2021,"It is a competent action/adventure show but it lacks the depth and nuance of exceptional star trek. The music score and visual effects are the best parts of this movie and I was 'moved' by the score during the first contact scene with the Vulcans.The main problem of this movie is the massive plot holes that require me to murder my suspension of disbelief and bury it and then grieve for it in order to accept this bizarre premise.What works:
Cochrane (Aka Roddenberry) is great and well performed.Visual effects are great and the borg are threatening.The musical score is great.What doesn't work:
The borg queen and the idea of the borg collective needing a willing human partner. The borg have assimilated thousands of species but humanity is somehow special?!The time travel stuff ------ This has been stated before but why wouldn't the borg just time travel in another part of the galaxy and then assimilate earth? This ability to time travel ruins everything because wouldn't any borg cube be able to do this even if this cube fails?! There should have been some space magic explanation for this time travel.Picard is out of character ----- In the tv show he has dealt with his assimilation but in order to create drama the writers shoehorn this revenge plot element in.I really enjoyed this movie when I watched it in the theatres when I was sixteen. I am mostly bored by the actions elements as an old man now. Action star trek tends to provide diminishing returns upon subsequent viewings and this movie falls into that category for me.",Star Trek - First Contact

76,Movie-12,A successful link to the chain of Star Trek movies. *** (out of four),7,29 September 2000,"""Star Trek: First Contact"" successfully continues the series, originally created by Gene Roddenberry, keeping fans in its grasps. It seems as if every few years Paramount releases a new ""Star Trek"" movie, and although they usually prosper at the box office, there are only so many ideas that can be portrayed involving the ""Enterprise,"" the starship housing to our traditional characters on board, including Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), Data (Brent Spiner), William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), and the Klingon, Worf (Michael Dorn). Screenwriters Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore breathe fresh air into the continuation, providing it with lots of energy, spirit, and engagement.This time the crew of the Enterprise must travel back in time before mankind made its first contact with extraterrestrial life forms. In 2063, there was a flight, piloted by a brilliant inventor named Cochrane (James Cromwell), observed by an alien race, the Vulcans, who interpreted man had become advanced enough to meet another race of beings. The Borgs, an evil alien race, part flesh, part technology, start from the 24th century and plan to travel back in order to prevent first contact and rewrite history. Another catch: the Borgs plan on populating Earth instead of humans. Only Capt. Picard and his faithful crew can prevent the Borgs from permanently altering human history.The film is directed by Jonathan Franks, who went on to direct ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" in 1998. Like all previous Star Trek movies, this one stimulates a believable atmosphere aboard the Enterprise drifting amongst deep space. Everything from the long, stretching corridors to winding hallways, to the convincing futuristic technology and profound decks, the locations on the set are entirely credible.I did not like some of the dialogue; it is often too expository and descriptive. We want the filmmakers to show us the story, not explain it to us, and in many incidences the characters end up explaining the plot to us in clunky,  hard-to-follow subtext. The film does have its fair share of action scenes and exciting activities, but several of the character's motives are not fully examined. Take the Borg queen for instance, we know what she wants because of the conversations that transpire. There is a thought-provoking subplot featuring Data and the Borg that queen that feels forced into place in order to spike up discussions and reveal important information the filmmakers are to lazy to show.One place in which this film strongly succeeds in is special effects, costume design, and make up effects; several of these variables were nominated for an Oscar in 1996. Probably one of the most evident examples of the movie's convincing visual arena in the Borg race themselves. The Queen is a perfect villain, with slippery, slimy texture, deliciously portrayed by Alice Krige, the aliens look as real as you and I. She induces a kind of sensuality I have never seen before, and don't expect to again. ""Star Trek: First Contact"" offers visual stimulation of a quality audiences seldom witness.It is fun to watch James Cromwell (""LA Confidential,"" ""The General's Daughter"") in this role. At first I did not think the part of an eccentric inventor fit him. However, as the story continued I bought the character completely. Along with a unique performance by Alfre Woodard, the two supporting performers prove how adaptable they can be.""Star Trek: First Contact"" contains tension from the opening shot to the closing finale. The conflict is introduced and complicated very early in the picture, leaving little time for the development of almost anything. The filmmakers obviously expect viewers to be familiar with the Star Trek series, thus they skip the introductions. Nonetheless, for a movie to inform audience members not familiar with the series and at the same time keep the attention of die-hard fans, that takes masterful filmmaking. ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is not quite at that level of achievement, but it is a stable link in the traditional chain.",Star Trek - First Contact
77,Bogmeister,ST FILM EIGHT: Picard Takes no Prisoners of the Borg,8,8 April 2007,"Following ""Generations,"" this is the first Trek film with only the TNG characters, featuring a new, more warlike Enterprise-E and new uniforms. The filmmakers followed a pattern established in earlier Trek films, in that they selected the best villain from the TV series (a la Khan in the 2nd Trek film) to confront the heroic crew. So, this film functions mostly as a sequel to the TNG episodes ""The Best of Both Worlds"" parts one & two, from 1990, in which the cyborg-race the Borg nearly succeeded in assimilating Earth. The Borg also assimilated Picard, temporarily, in those episodes, a process likened to a futuristic version of rape and slavery, so the most powerful elements of this story involve Picard revisiting this trauma; and this results in some of his less-civilized behavior, raising questions of just how far mankind has really evolved in the past 300 years. The Borg are sort of upgraded for this film, but this mostly involves giving them a more gritty look, superficially emphasizing the horrific aspects of their threat. Frankly, I preferred their appearance in the episodes, such as in ""Q Who?,"" where their skin merely lacked any pigmentation, rather than this mottled effect here. They were unique back then, whereas now they seem derivative of other sci-fi franchises, such as the Terminator films. Also damaging their unique qualities is the intro of a Borg Queen, created to have meaningful one-on-one dialog with Data and Picard. The concept of a queen ruling a hive is nothing new in science fiction, unfortunately; what always impressed me about the Borg before this was the lack of any central control - that is what really made them unique. But, enough with the negatives.Overall, the film is a blast. The first scene is a case study of how to begin a sf adventure - talk about transfixing an audience in the very first minute! The danger is that this first minute would overwhelm the rest of the film, but the script and first-time film director Frakes manage to provide a relentless pace for the remainder of the show, an almost non-stop action thrill ride to reflect the unstoppable nature of the enemy. Early on, we are thrown into the middle of a spectacular space battle (showing the Star Wars influence a bit more than the earlier movie Trek battles). It may be my favorite of any movie space wars, outdoing even the later Star Wars prequels. Of course, the filmmakers resorted to a time travel angle again (what is it with this obsession with time travel by Trek-makers since the eighties?), but they ended up selecting an interesting, pivotal moment in Trek history to wrap the story around - year 2063, to be precise. We are re-introduced to the famous Zefram Cochrane, the 'inventor' of warp drive, which resulted in the whole Starfleet/Federation civilization we first saw on the original Trek series in the sixties (Cochrane was first seen as a different actor in the original episode ""Metamorphosis""). I found the reinterpretation here of Cochrane bordering on cliché scripting - the re-used 'loser-turnaround-to-redeem-himself' plot; this type of story always makes me wonder how a guy who is out-of-his-mind drunk half the time manages to out-think all the clear-headed scientists. But, the bottom line is that it's an exciting, even thrilling storyline, with Stewart's best moments as the angry, yet in-charge, even ruthless Captain Picard. His scene with actress Woodard towards the end, when parallels are drawn again with Capt. Ahab and Moby Dick, is worth the price of admission by itself. Of the regulars, Sirtis as Troi, Dorn as Worf and Spiner as Data also get to shine in their scenes. There are also some entertaining cameos by characters from the other Trek series.",Star Trek - First Contact
78,0w0,"OK, but has plot-holes.",6,28 July 2020,"It's an OK Star Trek film, but there's a few plot-holes, such as the 'bad guys' simply beaming themselves onto the federation ship, which cannot be done unless their shields are down... and why would the federation ship have their shields down? They wouldn't.... so that's a big plot-hole.There's a few other milder plot-holes throughout the film, but none of them impact the story as much as the one mentioned above.Other than that, it's an OK Star Trek film... it has a lot of drama, and only a small amount of action. The vast majority of the film doesn't even take place in space, or on a far-away planet... it literally takes place on earth, and in a particularly boring place on earth to-boot!",Star Trek - First Contact
79,dr_foreman,"Holds up, for the most part",7,27 July 2006,"""First Contact"" is a fairly rare beast - a Star Trek movie that was a big, big hit with the general public as well as science fiction fans. Only ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" was clearly more popular than this film.So why did ""First Contact"" do so well? Simply put, because it's a good action yarn. The Borg are scary enemies, well-established in American popular culture, and there are plenty of space and phaser battles to keep audiences excited. The plot is intricate enough to be interesting, though not so complex or nerdy to put people off.Despite all these plusses, I must say that, back in 1996, I thought ""First Contact"" was sort of lame. I like it better now, but still see flaws.The segments that take place on planet Earth have never quite worked for me. What's so interesting, really, about hanging out in a ramshackle community of drunkards - particularly when the stuff happening aboard the Enterprise is so much more compelling? I've also never really liked the segment when the Borg build some sort of communications gubbins on the Enterprise's deflector dish. It strikes me as blatant padding, because it has nothing to do with the main thread of the plot.Ultimately, I think the problem with this film is that it's ""front-loaded,"" as they say. The giant space battle (well, not giant really...just sort of big) occurs almost right away. Many of the moody special effects involving the Borg cube are shown early on, too. Once the cube is destroyed - very easily, I must say - the Borg are never quite as threatening, and there are no more opportunities for large-scale action.This is not to say that the movie is bad. There's still plenty of good material, much of it involving Data, whose conversations with the Borg Queen are intriguing and often funny. (I can't say I find the Borg Queen sexy, though...nor do I really accept that they'd have a queen!) The special effects and music are slick all throughout, and the Next Generation crew are always competent performers, if not quite as likable as Captain Kirk and company.So, in the final analysis, there's no doubt that this is a pretty cool Star Trek movie. But, for whatever it's worth, I don't think it's quite great. It certainly would've benefited from more measured pacing, and more of a threatening Borg presence in the Earth scenes. Still, it's better than I remembered...",Star Trek - First Contact
80,LebowskiT1000,Excellent Star Trek Film!,10,20 August 2002,"I find it so interesting that people seem to like this Star Trek film so much better than the others.  Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that this is a great film, but I thought the other Star Trek films were just as good as this one.  There really isn't much to complain about in this film.  The special effects alone should be enough to get you in the theater, they are just mind-boggling!The story in this film is really quite interesting and definitely keeps you on your toes.  You can't wait to see what happens in the next scene.  For the most part the story is quite good, but the film does pose a few questions.  For instance, if time travel is so easy to do, then how do they police it and how do they keep the Borg from just going back in time again? Also, why is it that the Borg won't attack anyone until they seem them as a threat when they go around the galaxy enslaving and conquering whoever they can, I'm sure a lot of the beings that they assimilate are not threats at all?  Anyhow, that little plot point struck me as odd.  Other than that, the story seems pretty good to me.  There were a few minor things though that I didn't really like.  I couldn't stand that stupid ""Nicky The Nose"" character on the Holo-Deck, he looked SO STUPID!!!  Such a minor little thing, and could have easily been remedied.  Oh well...The acting is top notch in this film.  All of the core Star Trek cast members pull off a great performance.  ...And I have to mention that Marina Sirtis and Gates McFadden look fantastic in this film.  James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard were nice additions to the cast.  Also, I have to mention Alice Krige, she did a superb job as the Borg Queen!All in all, if you like the Star Trek films and haven't seen this one, you really ought to see it.  If you're just a fan of sci-fi films in general you should see this film.  I hope you enjoy it, thanks for reading.-Chris",Star Trek - First Contact
81,cariart,The Next Generation's Finest Moment...,9,2 December 2003,"Star Trek's successor to Gene Roddenberry, Rick Berman, never allowed the poor reviews for STAR TREK: GENERATIONS to upset him; he had been given an 'obligation' to provide a transition film between the original cast's series, and his own 'Next Generation' films, and 'killing' James Kirk freed him to focus on the film he REALLY wanted to make, STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT. And he created a classic, a film that for many fans has become the 'definitive' STAR TREK movie.From the opening scenes, which re-introduce the 'Next Generation's' greatest villains, the Borg, finally achieving their long-time goal of attacking Earth, and literally tearing Starfleet to shreds, as Picard and the Enterprise are ordered to stand down (Picard had been 'assimilated' once by the cyborgs, and the success of his 'deprogramming' was in question), there was an intensity that 'Trek' films hadn't shown since THE WRATH OF KHAN. When Picard decides to disobey orders and go 'in Harm's Way', you nearly want to cheer! Turning the battle around, the Enterprise sees victory at hand...until they discover that the 'core' of the Borg mother ship has plunged into Earth's atmosphere, and gone back in time. As the crew glimpses a 'changed' Earth, with humanity totally assimilated by the Borg, they plunge after the mother ship, to prevent history from being rewritten.Quite an opening scene!The film breaks into two stories, each entertaining. In an era two hundred years earlier, with Earth reeling from internal wars that have devastated much of the planet, Picard realizes that the Borg is attempting to prevent warp drive creator Dr. Zefram Cochrane from ever completing his prototype spaceship, thus denying the galaxy to the human race, and leaving them defenseless against the Borg. As First Officer Riker and most of the series' regulars protect the feisty engineer (first introduced in the original 'Trek' TV series by hunky Glenn Corbett; in FIRST CONTACT, the role is played by James Cromwell, hawk-nosed, antisocial, and hooked on ancient Rock n' Roll music), Data and Picard must deal with the growing Borg infiltration and assimilation of the Enterprise, and the imperious Borg Queen (lovely Alice Krige), who seduces Data with a chance to become 'human'.Jonathan Frakes proves an excellent director, balancing the action, comic, and dramatic elements with sensitivity and skill. While most of the series' regulars have little to do (a problem that would never be resolved in the 'Next Generation' films), Frakes still manages to give each a bit of on-screen time to at least remind fans that they are present, and he even manages to provide a brief but funny cameo by semi-regular fan favorite Dwight Schultz, as the terminally shy Lt. Reggie Barclay.FIRST CONTACT has so many memorable moments that it is nearly impossible to pick a single favorite one out. Cochrane's use of Steppenwolf's 'Magic Carpet Ride' as launch music for his guided missile/spaceship...Alfre Woodard's Lily Sloane, hiding in terror from the Borg, but still able to lecture Picard on doing the 'right thing'...'Star Trek: Voyager' regular Robert Picardo in a cameo as his medical hologram character, at a key moment...Data delivering the famous Borg 'tag line'...the Vulcan science party (led, although unmentioned, by Sarek, Spock's father), bemused at meeting the 'new kids on the block' for the first time...this movie has it all!There is only one major continuity error; the Borg, as cyborgs, depend on their human 'host' bodies to survive (a key factor in the film's climax), yet in one whole sequence they operate in the vacuum of space WITHOUT spacesuits! I cringe each time I see the scene, but I STILL love the movie!One other key element of the film cannot be praised enough; Jerry Goldsmith's score is one of his finest, combining the best elements of the STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE theme with a sweeping inspirational hymn for Cochrane, and eerie, discordant music for the Borg. The score is so profoundly moving that it could stand alone, as a symphonic work.Sadly, Berman and company never achieved the same heights with either of the subsequent 'Trek' films, but at least we have FIRST CONTACT, to show that a 'Next Generation' feature could be done 'right'.",Star Trek - First Contact
82,jhaggardjr,"Excellent ""Star Trek"" adventure",9,23 September 2000,"""Star Trek: First Contact"", the eighth film in the series and the second for the ""Next Generation"" crew, is one of the best ""Star Trek"" movies to date. This one ranks right up there with the three other even-numbered ""Star Trek"" films. The fourth (""The Voyage Home"") and sixth (""The Undiscovered Country"") ""Star Trek"" movies are still my favorites, with this one's on par with the second one (""The Wrath of Khan""). ""First Contact"" is about the Enterprise crew's battle against their most lethal enemy, the Borg. If you've watched the TV series, you'll remember that at one point Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) became a member of the Borg. This immediately sets the story in motion. The Borg travels back to the 21st Century to destroy the first time warp mission, with the Starship Enterprise right behind them. The Enterprise crew comes in and tries to stop the Borg from letting this happen. One of the things that works best in ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is the well-written screenplay which gives all the actors well-written parts. Stewart gives a strong performance as Picard. Jonathan Frakes (as Riker), Brent Spiner (as Data), LeVar Burton (as LaForge), Michael Dorn (as Worf), Gates McFadden (as Crusher), and Marina Sirtis (as Troi) are all terrific. All of these characters are given something to do which was sort of lacking in the previous film ""Star Trek: Generations"", and they make a very good impression thanks to the terrific writing. Also very good in ""Star Trek: First Contact"", the three guest stars. Alfre Woodard and James Cromwell are wonderful as two civilians from the 21st century who are helped by the Enterprise crew. Cromwell is a hoot as the man who invents warp drive. Also impressive, Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. Totally unrecognizable, Krige stands out as one of the best villains (or in this case villainess) in the ""Star Trek"" movie series. The special effects also get high marks. I think ""Star Trek: First Contact"" boasts the best special effects in a ""Star Trek"" movie to date. The sound effects are also top-notch. And Jerry Goldsmith's music score is outstanding. The films' dark tone keeps this one from being the best. Some of the violence is a little disturbing a times, but only a little. Jonathan Frakes does an exceptional job in his directorial debut here. It's a job well done! ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is excellent entertainment. For Trekkies, this is a must-see.***1/2 (out of four)",Star Trek - First Contact
83,DavidSim240183,The only TNG feature film to get everything right,10,8 October 2007,"Star Trek: The Next Generation was one of the finest SF series ever to grace TV screens. It started off a bit shakily, but when it found its footing in the third season, it paved the way for some of the very best SF stories you could ever hope to see on television. I still miss it dearly to this day.But the TNG feature films have proved much more variable. Star Trek: Generations was a major disappointment to everyone. It looked like an episode for the series that had found its way onto the big screen by mistake. And there was a feeling of tiredness to the whole enterprise (no pun intended). TNG was completely caught off guard in its new medium, and the film suffered as a result.Two years afterwards came their next feature film, Star Trek: First Contact. And the good news is this film is a massive improvement. Mainly because this one is more prepared for the big screen beforehand. Superb direction, incredible special effects and a quite multilayered screenplay to work from turn this into one of the best Trek films ever made. Its everything the first film wasn't.First Contact is directed by Jonathan Frakes, AKA Commander William Riker in the series. Frakes directed a handful of TNG episodes during his time on the show. Indeed the Season 5 episode Cause and Effect was his single finest hour as director.Because Frakes has experience directing the cast, he knows how to bring out the best from each and every one of them. And although FC is his first time out directing a feature film, he slides into the role with confidence and assurance. First Contact is a class act all the way. It delivers on every level.The reason why FC is my favourite of all the TNG films is that the villains of the piece are the Borg. For the unenlightened, the Borg are a race of cyborgs who transform every civilisation they encounter into Borg. They operate as a vast collective consciousness. They travel the galaxy in ships shaped like giant cubes. And they can adapt to any weapon used against them.The Best of Both Worlds was a truly stunning two-parter. The infamous story where Captain Picard was assimilated into the Borg collective. And Frakes does a superb job tying that story's plot line into this one.The Borg attempted to assimilate Earth in TBOBW, and try again in FC. But through a different means, time travel. The Borg travel back to the year 2063, a pivotal moment in history for the human race. Because this is the year when humans develop the warp drive. The Borg try to wipe out the scientist who built the warp ship that will lead to the formation of Starfleet. And its up to Picard and crew to stop them and preserve their future.First Contact is a film of three interweaving plots. First, the Enterprise crew's battle with the Borg. Making sure the warp flight goes to plan. And the Borg Queen's seduction of Data.Frakes is a natural talent in the directors chair. He keeps each individual story going at a breathless pace. The tone of the film is exciting, menacing, funny and moving at all of the right moments. Perfectly complemented by a superb film score from the late Jerry Goldsmith.The Borg's invasion of the Enterprise is gripping stuff. They look more menacing than ever. Which is good considering the direction the writers took the Borg in the series.Although I'm a huge fan of Star Trek, the series has an annoying habit of wimpifying its enemies. And that includes the Borg. They're much later appearances in the series involved the Borg's encounters with emotions, which only served to dilute them as an enemy. But Frakes has made the wise choice of returning them to they're former glory. Implacable, unrelenting, and unstoppable. Which is as it should be.Any scenes with the Borg on the ship are as scary as anything you'd see in Aliens. The tension level jumps into the red whenever they're around. And Frakes milks it for all its worth. Not only are there fierce firefights in the ship, there's a corker of a Borg fight outside the ship too. When Picard and a couple of others fight them on the hull in spacesuits.Jonathan Frakes also shows a talent for special effects with FC. The new Enterprise is a sleek spectacle, inside and out, although I still miss the old one. The Borg sets are awesome, and even occasionally operatic, such as the stunning opening shot of a Borg Hive. And the Borg costumes are better than ever.The scenes with James Cromwell as the inventor of the warp drive are comic relief to the serious stuff. But its amusing when he turns out to be not the paragon of humanity they've always envisioned him to be. And Cromwell does a great number of rotations from cocksure to cavalier and eventual horror at the future mapped out for him.I suppose if FC has a fault, its a little derivative. It borrows from a few sources like The Terminator, Aliens and Alien. But it takes all of the good qualities of those films and combines them into a rollicking, fast-paced action-packed thrill ride.And all the cast do their part. Patrick Stewart's on fine form, and he's up to the action scenes as well. Alice Krige is sexy and scary in equal measure as the Borg Queen, and her seduction of Brent Spiner's Data is skin-crawling to say the least.First Contact is the best of the TNG feature films because it strikes the perfect balance. Jonathan Frakes makes sure each storyline is given room to breathe, and there are plenty of in-jokes and surprise cameos for die-hard fans.Superb stuff!",Star Trek - First Contact
84,SkullScreamerReturns,Picardnator vs. RoboAliens,8,13 June 2020,"I was surprised, this is one of my favorite Star Trek movies. It starts very intense and the atmosphere doesn't drop at any point.The Borg are a very interesting villain(s) and they also look scary. Even though this is not a horror film in terms of violence, there is a horror-oriented feel, something similar to Alien. There is a constant eerie threat of the gruesome robot monsters lurking around the corner. Also the interior scenes at Enterprise look very good and enhance the atmposphere. There were a couple of cheap looking cgi lasers and explosions but only few. Mostly the visual effects are excellent.The time travel part about the earth of the past is not as interesting but not boring either. The movie maintains the pace and throws action scenes here and there to keep things interesting.As a more action packed and visual entry in the series this is a Star Trek film that any fan of sci-fi movies can watch even if ST is not your usual cup of tea.",Star Trek - First Contact
85,TheEmulator23,"The best Star Trek film, and a good one in it's own right.",8,11 September 2007,"This is an excellent film. It is enjoyable as a stand alone film, but even more enjoyable to those that know the characters. Now the main brilliance of this film is having the Borg as the bad guys. There is a lot to be said about the overall excellence of the acting, story, and yes even the special effects. This film is perfectly paced, and having excellent character actors (James Cromwell, Alice Krige, and the always excellent Oscar nominated Alfre Woodard) as the supporting players was also brilliant. Enjoy this flick for what it is and watch our favorites from Next Generation fight the best bad guys that the Star Trek world has ever had.",Star Trek - First Contact
86,roghache,Wonderful warp plot but an insult to Zephram Cochrane,8,11 March 2006,"Ours is a household of Trekkies, and personally for me, this Star Trek film ranks right up there with The Wrath of Khan (for its drama) and The Voyage Home (for its comedy). What an absolutely brilliant plot idea, the Borg up to their usual shenanigans, this time attempting to interfere with Zephram Cochrane's invention of the warp drive in the 21st Century. The Enterprise crew is wonderful as always, and the main plot line fabulous, though I find the film lags a bit during the latter half with the lengthy space shots outside the Enterprise. The finale is stupendous...the landing of the first alien ship and the dramatic descent of its Vulcan crew down the stairs. The moment when the cloaked Vulcan lifts his hood, revealing to the stunned earthlings his unusual ears will go down in the annals of Star Trek (and indeed all science fiction) history. Also, the theme music from this film is, along with the Voyager theme, the most moving in Trekdom. Both were composed by the talented late composer, Jerry Goldsmith.However, I am OUTRAGED by the complete alteration of the character of Zephram Cochrane, presumably to make him more entertaining and appealing to modern (brainless?) audiences. We all know what Cochrane is like from the episode ""Metamorphosis"" in the Original Series; he's handsome, clean cut, conventional, and presumably intelligent. To turn this pivotal ""historical"" character into a sleazy, swearing, drunken grease monkey (announcing that he's going to take a leak, mind you) is the worst outrage in the history of science fiction. You cannot simply alter an established character 180 degrees to pacify the masses... the ""dumbing down of Zephram Cochrane"", I call it. Are other true Trekkies not outraged or are they just laughing along with those who don't know any better? Poor Cochrane is rolling over in his grave, positively spinning. (Or will be...I keep forgetting that he probably hasn't even been born yet or is still in diapers.) By the way, I really didn't appreciate the swearing, especially Cochrane's remark when the Phoenix first goes into warp. The TV series manage just fine without this type of language, and I see no reason why the movies should deviate. Likewise, the Borg Queen's attempts to sexually arouse Data didn't impress me much either. Must sex be absolutely everywhere all the time?These factors aside, it's a great plot idea and an entertaining movie. My teenage son hopes he'll live to be 76 years old so he'll be around when warp drive comes into existence in 2063!",Star Trek - First Contact
87,RiffRaffMcKinley,Now Here's A Good One!,10,2 September 2007,"After the mind-numbing debacle of ""Generations,"" it's refreshing to see a Star Trek movie that actually has depth, heart, commitment, and wit once again... a ship that, before this movie, hadn't flown across the silver screen for five years.""First Contact"" has a plot line that embodies humanity's perpetual struggle to wipe out evil and oppression (the struggle we're doing so very well with now in real life... not). The enemy are the mindless Borg Collective under the leadership of their brutal, individualistic Queen (Alice Krige).The film has special effects that truly wow, and (yes!) an appropriate use of the Steppenwolf classic ""Magic Carpet Ride,"" as well as great performances from newcomers like James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard. ""First Contact"" could very well be the best in its class.",Star Trek - First Contact
88,renegadeviking-271-528568,The Borg are really awesome! Best Star Trek film,8,31 December 2019,"When the Borg travel back in time to prevent humanity from venturing into space, Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must prevent them from destroying the future of mankind.Star Trek First Contact was a huge critical and commercial success on its release in 1996. It gave a much needed boost to the television franchise at a time when viewing figures were flagging.This is amongst the very best of the Star Trek movies. It has a consistent tone and is accessible to non-trekkies, whilst rewarding the hard-core fans.First Contact was ably directed by Jonathan Frakes, (Commander Riker) whose fast shooting style earned him the nickname 'two-takes Frakes'. He uses off-kilter camera angles to convey unease and handles the action scenes very well.Maybe it was Frakes' familiarity with the cast that brought out such good performances from his cast mates. In particular Patrick Stewart, who revels in the Ahab like role afforded him. I also enjoyed Alfre Woodards performance as Lily Sloane, who more than holds her own against Patrick Stewart. The large ensemble cast all get memorable moments, with Marina Sirtis unexpectedly funny as a drunk Deanna Troi.First Contact plays to some of the greatest strengths in the Star Trek movie franchise, great music, strong action scenes with impressive and ground-breaking visual effects sequences. Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent and develops some of the themes used in The Motion Picture. I love the sweeping main title music that incorporates the Alexander Courage fanfare.The film had a larger budget than the disappointing 'Generations' and it's put to very good use, with impressively large sets and superior special effects work from ILM.krigeThe audacious entrance of Borg queen is especially memorable. Her head and shoulders descend from the ceiling and fuse with the rest of her body. The special effect combined make-up, blue screen and CGI to produce an intense and creepy sequence.Alice Krige's Borg queen is a kinky delight, at once both seductive and repellent. She tries to seduce Data by grafting flesh onto his arm. The scene where she urges him to ' tear the skin from your limb as you would a defective circuit' is genuinely disturbing.As with many of the Star Trek films, the movie does have its flaws. For example, if the Borg can go back in time, why bother to attack Earth at all? Simply go back in time, fly to Earth and assimilate it - with no pesky Picard following through the temporal vortex! Also, the movie is a little violent and brutal in places, perhaps unnecessarily so.But these are minor nit-picks, the things that Trekkers get their panties in a bunch over. For the vast majority of the movie going public this is a solid action-adventure movie with some nifty effects work.Although we can see influences from other films, notably James Camerons Aliens, the films themes are typically Star Trek and involve loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This is evidenced by Picard's refusal to destroy the Enterprise and to instead rescue his friend (Data). Indeed, this theme of loyalty to ones friends is one of the overall themes of Star Trek as a whole. Despite moments of darkness, the film is unashamedly Star Trek and was a wonderful treat for fans celebrating Star Trek's 30th anniversary. The movie remains optimistic and stands the test of time well - much like Star Trek itself.Rating: 8/10",Star Trek - First Contact
89,cosmic_quest,Trek at its best!,9,5 September 2006,"After the lacklustre disappointment of 'Star Trek: Generations', 'Star Trek: First Contact' renewed my faith in the Trek films and left me blown away by its brilliance.Picard and his crew are now aboard the newly-commissioned Enterprise-E when the Borg invade Federation space. Ordered not to intervene in the fierce battle raging between Starfleet and the Borg Cube because of Picard's personal experience as a drone, he ignores his commands to take control of the fleet. Although, under his instruction, he is able to elicit the destruction of the Cube, a small section of the ship escapes into a time distortion in an attempt to change history by assimilating Earth in the mid twenty-first century. The Enterprise swiftly follows, determined to save the planet and the future...The usual faces are all back in fine form with Patrick Stewart giving a fantastic performance as a Picard caught between his mission and his vengeance while Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis and LeVar Burton clearly relish the chance to portray their characters' confusion and fascination with twenty-first century Earth and meeting Earth's greatest scientist Zefram Cochrane, the man who would revolutionise light speed capability for starships in the Trek-verse. It's not often Star Trek romances work but Alfre Woodward was excellent as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's aide who has a chemistry with Picard and seems one of the few characters able to interact with his character on a personal level. James Cromwell was just hilarious as Zefram Cochrane, a drunken pale shade of the hero he is thought to be in the twenty-fourth century and a man who doesn't want the devotion of the Enterprise crew (his scene with Dwight Schultz's Barclay was a great touch). And Alice Krige leaves a lasting impression as the cool, sociopathic Borg Queen.As well as first-rate special effects for the Borg battle and Zefram's first flight, 'Star Trek: First Contact' has everything in terms of a tight, involving plot with plenty of action, humour and character development. The Borg are depicted with the same chilling air that was apparent in 'The Best of Both Worlds' (one of the best 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episodes for the uninitiated). The film rounds off in a manner that is very satisfying and almost bittersweet, giving hope for the future the Enterprise crew returns to, the future of Cochrane's war-torn Earth and the future of our planet in general.'Star Trek: First Contact' is, undeniably, the best of the Trek films for the diverse themes it touches upon and for the way it takes the series back to its roots of strong, stalwart characters engaged in action and drama. It is also a film that would appeal to both Trek fans and non-fans alike as, apart from scenes referencing Picard's link to the Borg that can be quickly figured out by anyone with a brain, it easily stands alone without requiring an in-depth knowledge of 'The Next Generation'. Perhaps, one to initiate your friends into the brilliance of Trek!Overall, certainly a film to see if you want to see Trek, and sci-fi, at its best.",Star Trek - First Contact
90,whatch-17931,Would have been so much more special with the 1701-D,8,23 January 2021,"I actually thought the 1701-D looked positively horrid back in 1987. The insane number of windows, the unconvincing deflector dish. And the interior- lol, it really did seem like a cruise ship in space.We came to love the D as part of TNG.Then came the 1701-E. The militaristic exterior and interior. The bridge? Scary looking dark place which doesn't look comfortable at all, and it looks like you would tend to trip over things crossing it.Granted, it's believable Starfleet would go in a military direction because of threats from the Borg and Dominion that were not present when the D was built.But, while the destruction was one heck of a spectacular scene, the ship didn't actually need to be destroyed.",Star Trek - First Contact
91,The_Core,Many weak points...,5,13 April 2005,"I've seen this movie several times at this point, and each time I see it I notice more of its weaknesses. Pacing is terrible in this film -- plot points that should take a minute or two go on for much longer (e.g. disengaging the magnetic shield to prevent the Borg from communicating, this scene goes on and on and on), and stuff that should be emphasized flashes by in a blip (e.g. the scene with Picard deciding the fate of the Enterprise).Someone else noted that the Borg are part biological, part machine. That point was respected with the Borg queen dying, but not with the Borg setting up the transmitter in space -- their flesh would have been frozen and destroyed by the vacuum.And maybe it's just me, but I found the whole Zephram Cochrane subplot so cheesy it was embarrassing -- the way he behaved (a rocket scientist? Suuuurreee...), Deanna Troi getting drunk, the music... it all feels adolescent and ridiculous. The Vulcan coming out of the ship at the end and his first words being ""Live Long and Prosper"" (that's supposed to be a goodbye, not a hello!).To summarize -- in my opinion, this film is the most overrated Star Trek movie ever made. I believe the most underrated to be the new director's cut of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" If you haven't seen the latest version of that one on DVD, I'd recommend a rental and skip this entirely... unless you're a *huge* TNG fan you're not missing much.",Star Trek - First Contact
92,illbebackreviews,"The only great film from the TNG and in fact, the only ""good"" one",8,18 May 2013,"Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered to be 'The Wrath of Khan' of the New Generations films and rightly so. This film is a truly great film and to consider how it bounced back after 'Star Trek: Generations' is beyond me.Immediately into the film, we are told that Captain Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, was once assimilated by the Borg. News then breaks that a new Borg is prepared to attack Earth and the crew decide to disobey the orders of the Enterprise, with the android Data saying ""To hell with our orders!"" and so the Enterprise decide to help out a fleet that is attacked by the Borg. After the battle comes to an abrupt end, the Enterprise realize that the Borg has indeed used time travel to arrive at the day before aliens make first contact with Earth and must travel back in time to stop this from happening, which involves getting the creator of the Warp drive to activate it.I was extremely hesitant and afraid to watch this film, realizing how bad 'Generations' was. I could not take the pain of watching another bad Trek film, even when critics had stated it to be one of the best, I did not believe it! Thankfully, this is indeed one of the best and I personally rank it the second best. This opinion is subject to change once I do get to see JJ Abram's 2009 reboot but Star Trek: First Contact is an extremely interesting film with a far better written characters and story.Think back to 'Generations' when then android Data was simply making horrible jokes about an emotion chip that helps him understand jokes that were said years ago. Here, he is a far more interesting character and despite a few corny moments, Data is one of the highlights of the film. Take a look back at the villain in 'Generations' whose goal was to somehow travel back into the Nexus. Here, the villain is the Borg, possibly the coolest villain. First Contact also has the best action sequences in the series, up to date, and with a budget of $48 million, the film included great set pieces, possibly the best special effects up til now and was a commercial success, considering it made approximately 3 times its overall budget in the Box Office.The 'Star Trek' franchise suffers from often poor special effects, often tedious moments and corny dialogue that are only very limited in 'Wrath of Khan' and 'First Contact' The Borg were extremely interesting and intense villains and the Klingon Worf was extremely well done in the film. All the characters that were laughable in the previous entry to the Trek franchise have been re-done in a far more interesting way. The story itself is the best of the franchise and the visual effects and set piece have never looked better. A scene that stands out when referring to great set pieces for its time is the scene where Picard, Worf and the other officer are standing atop the Enterprise and attempting to thwart the plans of the Borg.Something interesting about this film is the direction they took with Data, whose motivations were clear: to be more human despite being a mechanical android. I love how the Borg gave him human skin and tried making him more human. That stuff worked very well in the film and gave another dimension to Data- something which 'Generations' utterly failed at.'Star Trek: First Contact' is most definitely superior to 'Generations' and is the true introduction to the New Generations series. An extremely interesting premise is backed up by fantastic writing and directing, great action sequences and fantastic special effects. Quite possibly the best Trek film, along with 'Wrath of Khan' and a true surprise. Overall, this is one of the great Sci-Fi films.",Star Trek - First Contact
93,RealLiveClaude,"Good, but just that...",7,17 January 2016,"This might be rated as one of the best Star Trek movies, but in my book, had some better expectations.Picard's crew have to fight a Borg attack against orders. An escaping Borg ball enters a time rift close to Earth, to cause a time distortion which makes a Borg collective of the planet. However, to avoid this, the Enterprise enters the same rift to battle the evil Borg Queen and its Army on the same time that an important discovery might open a new age of space exploration...Though Jonathan Frakes' direction is well done, story seems to stretch a bit on some parts, acting is OK and up to the TV series level, good special effects, but at least, we tend to forget the ""Generations"" movie and having a moment of pure Borg fun here.If no ""Original series"" characters appear here, we happened to see Robert Picardo's ""Doctor"" from Voyager and Dwight Schultz as the neurotic ""Reg Barclay"".I would recommend if you are into the Borg rivalry...",Star Trek - First Contact
94,basrutten,Star Trek finally done right,8,16 December 2002,"Let me first say that I used to (somewhat of) a Star Trek fan, but ultimately I got tired of it, basically because I watched reruns of ""Voyager"" every day and found them to be very repetitive. I did try to watch some of the older movies a while back, but found them to be incredibly dull and/or incredibly silly and usually didn't bother to watch them to the end.Imagine my surprise when I was not only to actually finish watching this movie, but also found it very entertaining. I guess everything just fell into place for this movie: characters that are finally allowed to show emotions (Picard lets his anger get the best of him, Data has feelings, characters make funny and sarcastic remarks), an enemy that's actually a threat, reasonably good special effects, and not as much quasi-scientific nonsense as usual. It's still Star Trek of course...don't expect explosive action or epic battles like in ""Star Wars"" or suspense like ""Alien"". But if you're looking for an entertaining sci-fi movie, this movie is certainly worth a look.*** out of **** stars",Star Trek - First Contact
95,daniewhite-1,Good idea,6,17 December 2019,"After failing to marshal a single good idea in the previous star trek film, 'generations' the producers of this veteran franchise clearly must have decided that the next film could really do with some!So they gave more dynamism to the characters- less sitting, standing, looking, sitting down again, smiling and talking techno babble for every member of the cast instead they do things and experience physical changes, even if it's just to the extent of putting them in a new ship setting so that they've all been literally 'moved around' from where their characters had taken root over the span of 8 years.The next good idea was the Borg. Bringing them into the piece allowed for a story with an actual sense if jeopardy....imaginr that in a star trek film!! Well, here it is, most of the time.Sadly for the second film running that star trek writing crutch emerges again: ""time travel""....its incredible that starships in this universe ever meet because time travelling seems almost as rife as interstellar travel. It would hardly be less if starfleet deployed the tardis instead of the enterprise.But as the enterprise is so often the only ship in the sector.....maybe it actually IS the case that federation ships are not so much ""where"" as ""when"" all the while.Once the time travel nonsense is dealt with......i mean.....why don't the Borg time travel before they set out to Earth.....that would greatly reduce the chances of starfleet even possibly thwarting the attack.....wouldnt it....in fact waiting until you are in contact with the enemy before undertaking your most crucial manoeuvre is probably the kind of operational planning that only script writers would suppose of their baddies. The film features multiple further absurdities of plot holes but it does have a rollicking ride of mega baddies and desperate goodies. With a cool style of visual design. Nice character external/internal conflicts. Good performances, with well worked out responses to peril and defeat.These words: ""jeopardy"", ""peril"", ""desperate"" are good tones for an action adventure film to be engendering. It makes a contribution to helping the audience to care and be involved in the exploits and the stress of the protagonists.Overall then the action writing, also the acting, production and direction seem to warrant a complimentary 6/10 review from me. This is probably generous because the film is indeed badly written in other senses and it certainly doesn't go in for a greater thematic depth or philosophical abstraction as many incarnations of star trek do but for what it is I feel that 'First Contact' deserves praise.",Star Trek - First Contact
96,gritfrombray-1,Maximum warp!,9,21 May 2007,"Went to the premiere of this here in Ireland and got to meet Gates McFadden for a second time, along with Alice Krige. This film was a real treat after that rubbish, Star Trek Generations. Although the Borg story was something that had been done already this was a much darker Borg with a much more foreboding aura about them. The space battle at the start was amazing and Jean Luc's 'connection' to them was a brilliantly realized idea. The Borg attack Earth and the Enterprise is told to stay away because of Jean Luc's prior involvement with them. As we hear over the com link ship after ship report losses Picard orders the Enterprise to the battle, disregarding his orders. When the Borg try to stop first contact with the Vulcans by traveling back in time we see a very different Earth and a whole new perspective on Humanity and an almost poverty stricken people which was a very interesting angle as the aftermath of the Nuclear Holocaust has never been explored to any real degree in Star Trek. When the Borg are stopped it seems as though all is OK and once Zefram Cochrane's warp ship is repaired all will be fine. But, alas, the Borg are on the Enterprise having transported there just prior to their ship's destruction. Patrick Stewart gives one hell of a performance and the scars of his previous abduction are evident. Brent Spiner also gives a colossal performance and provides a great twist at the end. This is the formula for a brilliant Next Gen movie. Right up there with Trek's best, The Wrath Of Khan.",Star Trek - First Contact
97,Christopher_Reid,Pretty fun with cool effects but also a bit annoying,8,4 April 2015,"I still don't know much about Star Trek but now I've seen several of the movies. This seems to be one of the most popular ones. I did enjoy a lot of the visuals and the general plot. Patrick Stewart is very cool and most of the characters are reasonably interesting. Data in particular because he bridges man and machine. He seems to be the sort-of Spock replacement. He is so obsessed with learning more about human emotions and never understands them and yet he seems so kind and curious and balanced himself.I have to say, I found the Borg to be quite stupid. They're so concerned with being some kind of perfect or superior race but they're ugly and slow, they even let their adversaries walk right past them. Plus, the whole idea of assimilating other species into yours without losing anything is pretty dumb. Of course you're losing something! You can't just magically strap on foreign DNA and hope that everything grows and adds. But I suppose that's the point, that they're flawed in their logic and must therefore be stopped.I didn't like the James Cochran parts very much. They were too dull and slow. A drunkard isn't appealing as any kind of character really. Why spend so much of a sci-fi movie with humans in crappy clothing talking and wasting time? I did find the whole concept of first contact interesting though. They happen to be witnessing a really significant event in human history. There is an aura about the place and time that the characters seem to feel which then makes you feel the same way. And it's important to the plot, of course.The black lady I found very annoying for most of the movie. She doesn't know anything but she's so bossy and determined. What happened to thinking or opening your eyes to a new world? I find those kinds of artificial conflicts very frustrating. For example, the way she gets all upset and angry before finally trusting Picard much later. Do we really need to go through all that? Why is she so hostile? Can't we focus on the main adversary in the film? The cool, mysterious, futuristic parts?Picard's inner struggle played out nicely. There are some interesting insights into the difference between revenge and doing the right thing. The ambiguity. It's much more exciting when you actually feel unsure as to how things are going to turn out. There's a lot at stake and it's interesting to see how characters behave under that pressure. Do they snap? Work together? Fight with each-other? Become really courageous and do something crazy?I mainly enjoyed this movie for the colours, special effects, tension, action scenes, music, strategy and sense of impending doom. I'm not a Trekkie yet but I would certainly recall this movie as being pretty cool and quite entertaining.",Star Trek - First Contact
98,son_of_cheese_messiah,Formulaic sci-fi,4,27 June 2011,"For some reason that I cannot understand this substandard pot-boiler has a high reputation among fans. Although it is lacking in every depart, its real crime is the badness of its characterisation. Virtually everyone here acts out of character. Deanna Troy appears drunk in a leaden and embarrassing 'comedy' scene; the usually calm, assured Picard becomes an Ahab-like obsessive willing to sacrifice his own crew for revenge; Worf utters the absurd ""assimilate this"" line worthy of a cheap 80s cop film. Possibly worst of all, even worse than seeing Picard gun down his own men, is the borg, a complex entity whose mythology has been established over the years, being reduced to a hive run by a Cruella Deville-like queen. Nor are the action scenes much to write home about. Very average.",Star Trek - First Contact
99,David_Frames,Not nearly as good as everyone seems to think it is,6,9 June 2005,"So there! Sure, I'll elaborate if you like. This is basically the T.V story the Best of Both Worlds, to which it elicits unfavourable comparisons fused with Star Trek IV and isn't a patch on either of those. The previous Trek suffered from poor pacing, not a problem here - just the opposite in fact, if anything the damn thing all moves along too fast. It's a film terrified to pause for breath in case the easily distracted fall asleep. I'd have preferred a bit of build up to the initial Borg attack, something of a proper introduction to the new ship - some character building scenes including ones which conveyed a real idea of who and what the Borg were but I suppose that might alienate those all important casual viewers who have every right to effect the shape of these movies as they don't care about the T.V series at all and probably have never bothered to watch it. There's an interesting irony you may want to ponder for a while. Anyway, back to the film and the use of the Borg as villains. First Contact dilutes the best enemies a starship captain ever had. The very thing that made the Borg frightening was that they were a monolithic force of technology enhanced destruction: faceless and motiveless, aside from they're desire to add you and your culture to their collective consciousness - committed space Marxists you might say. Writers Braga and Moore succumb to the old and tired movie doctrine that the hero must face a single, identifiably human villain and so we have the creation of the Borg queen - great entrance, bad idea. Suddenly the Borg aren't faceless and equally interconnected, as the T.V series established to great effect but a mindless army controlled by a sinister independent mastermind. Their original focus on assimilation rather than conventional conquest made them a formidable nightmare on screen but here they've become mere drones, executing the Queen's insidious plot to overthrow the Earth. Also, in a bid to rope in those all important non-fans, the action is considerably beefed up here prompting an out of character transformation for Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard. The diplomat and explorer of the T.V series is replaced by a clone who machine guns Borg like a 24th century version of Bruce Willis, coldly shoots colleagues and goes into wild tantrums, smashing glass cabinets and the like. Poor old Mr.Stewart is being asked to be a kind of Captain McClane and just isn't up to it, reduced to some wild and embarrassing hamming and some ill-advised overacting.Anyone who sat through 170 odd episodes of the old show knows this isn't how the Captain conducts business. This isn't a particularly well executed actioner either because Frakes is no John McTernian or even, bless 'im, Renny Harlin. He may have borrowed from Aliens and numerous other sci-fi gunfests but this is still shot like a television episode and it all makes for diverting but so-so viewing. Given the promise offered by the Borg in the television series and the possibilities allowed by an increased budget, First Contact shows a distinct poverty of imagination and ambition which nevertheless transformed itself into box office success - no doubt due to those aforementioned casual viewers. I doubt very much whether Gene Rodenberry would have liked it at all.",Star Trek - First Contact
100,johnny-08,"""Borg? Sounds Swedish. """,8,17 July 2007,"I'm not a huge fan of ""Star Trek"" but I can recognize a good movie when I see it. Personally, my favorite Captain is Jean-Luc Picard and I knew that movie with Patrick Stewart in this role couldn't be bad. I had a great time watching it and every movie that holds my attention for that long is good. Every movie of this type. There are some serious problems that this movie is putting on. Like possible Third World War, all the mankind erased and many more of topics that could happen in our future. Movie is made in 1996. and year 2065. that is mentioned in movie doesn't seem that far. Is it possible that some sort of disaster will happen to us in near future? That's the one of the reason why I liked this movie. Topics from today can be recognized in a plot like that.Jonathan Frakes directed this movie and it is very important to say that he's also starring in this one. As you all probably know he's Commander William Riker. Why I mentioned this? It's because after years of working together actors needed some director that they can relay on and I think that Jonathan Frakes did amazing job. Patrick Stewart is once more brilliant in his role and he's the best actor in this team. I also liked two actress: Alfre Woodard and Alice Krige. Alice Krige specially as Borg Queen. Also James Cromwell has important role in this movie.Music. People listen to rock in 2065! Great, I'm glad to hear that.There are also lots of funny scenes. Most of them include Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). Something interesting. When Patrick Stewart is talking about ""Moby Dick"" and Ahab in this movie. He didn't know that one day he'll play Ahab in a movie.I really enjoyed this one and I hope that all of ""Star Trek"" fans weren't disappointed. For me, great way to start taking more notice about some other ""Star Trek"" movies. Go on Picard, you're great. And Mr.Stewart, thank you.",Star Trek - First Contact

103,craig-hopton,Brilliant,8,31 October 2014,"Right up my street. I grew up watching Star Trek: The Next Generation so I know and love the characters. And the Borg were always my favourite bad guys. So how could I possibly not love this movie?OK I do accept that it's basically nothing more than an extended TV episode with some extra money thrown at the special effects (i.e., the Borg queen 'floating torso' scene), but hey I'm not complaining!I thought this movie worked perfectly - capturing all the best elements of the TV show. There is plenty of action, from a massive star-fleet firefight to one on one combat and even a space-walk battle on the outside of the ship. There are great Sci- Fi themes/conundrums - time travel, android with feelings, etc. And lots and lots of unnerving moments with the Borg.A firm favourite.",Star Trek - First Contact
104,zenmateisshite,Below average,5,15 April 2019,"There are 4 main themes in this movie: the concept of time travel, the concept of first contact, Picard's ordeal with the Borg, Data's struggle with his feelings, or lack thereof.
You can enjoy this movie and give it a different rating based on how familiar are you with the Star trek franchise as follows:
If you are an average joe (living in a hole) and never watched any Star Trek episodes or movies, you will like this movie because to you about two or three of the themes are intriguing and borderline genius. You might give it 9-10 stars.If you are slightly familiar with Star Trek you will know that these topics have been done before, and you might find this execution better, or worse than those other attempts, so you might give it 8-9 stars.If you are a fan of Star Trek and familiar with all the series and episodes then you will be a bit more critical and might realise that the execution of this version is not the best so might give it 6-7 stars.If you are a hard-line fan who watched all The Next Generation episodes (many more than once), you would realise that this movie is a waste of time, that there are so many errors, and that time travel is a stupidest idea ever. You might give it 5 or less stars. I'm generous so I gave it 5.To me, this movie was made to make the cast and crew some extra bucks and that is fine. It added no value what-so-ever. The 5 star is for some good scenes like Worf's spacewalk deflector fight. Other than that most of the 110 mins are just meh.",Star Trek - First Contact
105,Svenstadt,The definitive Star Trek film.,9,12 July 2019,"This is just about the perfect Star Trek movie. It has all the elements that make a great movie. It also adds some horror elements to it, which can be scary at times. This sci-fi / horror crossover is the only type of horror I will even watch BTW. Jonathan Frakes (aka ""Riker"") directs, and his talent is undeniable. The reason I did not give it a '10' is due to the cheesy nature of Data's seduction once he is captured. It is just more Star Trek cliches in this regard. However, it stays true to Star Trek. They made sure to give plenty of exterior shots of the new Enterprise. (BTW - they redesigned the exterior on the next installment). The thing that made it so effective is that it tells the story of the founding of the Federation, but it does so in a very delicate way, even despite the peril of the situation. It makes sure not to go too far in any single area, which is hard to do. There is enough action to please, but enough Trek to leave the fans happy. This single movie spawned a sequel, as the ST: Enterprise episode ""Regeneration."" For those dorks who may be reading this, it is kind of like on the movie ""Tigerland,"" where we go through all the entire tense movie, and then a slow denouement at the end to soothe your battered nerves... The ending was particularly powerful.",Star Trek - First Contact
106,DanB-4,The Best Trek,10,30 August 2002,"First Contact is the best Star Trek has been, and likely the best it will ever be. This movie has a great plot (Earth discovering warp in the past) the greatest villain in the Borg, spectacular supporting performances from James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard and wall to wall action.In the peak-and-valley Star Trek franchise, this is the highest peak. It can be easily enjoyed by anyone who has not seen or is not familiar with Star Trek, but is still meaty enough for the ardent fan. One mishandled scene involving Steppenwolf stops this movie from being perfect. But still, a strong recommendation. **** out of ****.",Star Trek - First Contact

108,Fever,Much better than the first,9,13 August 1998,"As Star Trek movies go, odd numbered ones are bad, even numbered ones are good. ""First Contact"" definitely fell in the good category. Much better than the disgraceful ""Generations"", this has more action, more story, better lighting, and much better acting. And this time, Picard doesn't get his butt kicked. While the Enterprise E is a little hard to get used to, true Trekkers (and even non-Trekkers) will enjoy this well made flick.",Star Trek - First Contact
109,BB-15,As Good As Star Trek Gets,8,8 December 1999,"Star Trek First Contact is a quality effort. It is a continuation of one of the favorite conflicts in Star Trek, against the Borg. It has good action, special effects and acting. The opening scene is one of the best in a sci-fi film, simply chilling. First Contact has several themes that it plays with. The story takes place in Earth's past, shattered by world war 3. So we have time travel to think about. There is a man on Earth who could become a great hero if history is not changed. What makes greatness? Is it selfishness, heroics, luck or a combination of all three? The third issue involves Picard and the Borg. When is a grudge too personal, too hateful? Unlike Star Trek Insurrection, all these ideas are presented clearly.If this is such a great movie, then why wasn't it a blockbuster like Phantom Menace or The Matrix? There is the cuteness factor. Star Trek rarely has cute characters that appeal to young children. There is the coolness factor. Many of the actors (Stewart, Cromwell and Woodard) are very good. But they are older, they don't wear leather and don't look that good in trench coats. Then there is the blood bath factor. Star Trek heroes don't kill the 200 or so bad guys, typical of today's action movies. My only problems with the movie are that Frakes while a good director leaves much to be desired as an actor. And the hero Cochrane seems to be too much of a drunk to build a warp ship. Star Trek First Contact is a blend of suspense, sci-fi ideas and action. It is also a human drama about how we strive to be better people and to build a better world. All of this is wrapped up with fantasy, danger and excitement in a very entertaining package.",Star Trek - First Contact
110,manchester_england2004,The finest adventure of the TNG crew!,9,30 July 2009,"STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT is the 8th movie in a series that has so far produced 11 movies.This is my second favourite of the Star Trek movies, second only to STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN. Like STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN, this movie can also be enjoyed by both those familiar to the Star Trek franchise and those new to it. Reading through the comments, I have noted comments from people who enjoyed it as a sci-fi action movie in its own right.I will sum up the plot with those unfamiliar with Star Trek in mind - an alien race known as the Borg apathetic to individuality go back more than 300 years in time to attack Earth, colonise it and absorb its inhabitants into its collective. Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise follows the Borg back to Earth to stop their plans.This very simple plot line brings an energetic story filled with virtually non-stop shoot-em-up action. Unlike most action movies, however, the antagonist is far more menacing. The Borg have no concept of individuality. It cannot be reasoned with. Killing one Borg barely has the impact of, say, removing one blood cell from a human body. The Borg in this movie are far more menacing than they were in the TV series.For those familiar with the Star Trek franchise, I can confirm that all the familiar faces from the crew in the THE NEXT GENERATION series all appear here - Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Dr Crusher and Troi.The movie represents a massive transformation from its predecessor, STAR TREK: GENERATIONS. For the first time we witness many members of the TNG crew behave or tempted to behave out-of-character due to the scale of the situation they find themselves in. Without giving away spoilers, I can state that characters in this movie face the prospect of having to turn against one another.The acting across the board is top-notch. The actors' performances are so captivating that they genuinely invite the audience to share the feelings of their characters.Patrick Stewart deserves special mention because he faces the greatest acting challenge - reprising his role as a character he played for 7 years in the TV series and a prior movie - now having to play the said character, Captain Picard, in a very different manner. The Captain Picard of this movie is not the calm diplomat from the TV series, he is someone with anger-fuelled determination to get revenge on the Borg, who once altered his biology so that he became part of their collective for a short time. His performance has to be seen to be believed and is enough to silence critics who claim he is unable to play a hero.Alice Krige gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career as the Borg Queen. Her performance provides a perfect distraction from the major plothole - the existence of a head of the Borg collective. The Borg collective communicates as one voice with each drone being the same. So it could not feasibly have a single leader. When you see Alice Krige in action, however, you will find it easy to suspend your disbelief.James Cromwell has fun playing Zephram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive referenced all through the franchise. For those unfamiliar with Star Trek, the warp drive is a component able to make starship engines travel at hyper speeds. I found the Zephram Cochrane in this movie much more exciting to watch than the bland version played by Glenn Corbett in an episode of the original series.The real drawback with regards to the acting is Alfre Woodard. She was not a convincing lover or protégé for Picard and I couldn't help but wonder if she was drafted in as a replacement for Whoopi Goldberg. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, Whoopi Goldberg played a character named Guinan in the TNG series. She acted as a protégé ready to give wise words of advice to many crew members on the ship, including Picard.Jonathan Frakes shows that he is just as good behind the camera as he is in front of it. His direction brings a great science-fiction story to life that is genuinely thought-provoking, emotionally moving and highly entertaining. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Direction for his work on this movie.The new starship Enterprise-E seems very dark and claustrophobic compared to the seemingly vast, bright and colourful Enterprise-D from the TV series and the previous movie. However, the Enterprise-E provides a perfect backdrop for the action to take place since its feel fits the tone of the movie perfectly. A wise decision was made to keep the bulk of the action on the ship rather than on Earth. Having said that, the events depicted on Earth help to offset the tension and allowing the audience to take a quick breath before being thrust back in again. The mix of light and dark works like a charm.To summarise, STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT is a first-rate entry into the Star Trek series of movies that can be enjoyed by Star Trek fans and newcomers to Star Trek alike. I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys sci-fi action movies.",Star Trek - First Contact
111,jimmyb-03299,One complaint,8,14 August 2019,In the holodeck picard was easily able to take out the borg with holographic tommy guns so why not replicate an arsenal of holographic ak47's since they cant adapt to bullets with no frequency and battle is over..?,Star Trek - First Contact
112,Caps Fan,One of the Best Trek Films.,8,4 March 2007,"It's a mystery to many people, particularly ""Star Trek"" fans of long standing (such as me!), as to why a series that sustained a generally high level of excitement, tension and fun through most of its long run on television had such difficulty doing the same in feature films. It's also a mystery as to why the best successes in the latter medium were achieved in the even-numbered films (apart from the very last one, 10) while the odd-numbered ones were, at best, mediocre.This eighth offering in the movie series provides plenty of clues on the first mystery and happily continues the latter tradition to give us arguably the best ""Star Trek"" film so far.The film wisely includes two old favorites that made for some of the best television episodes  the concept of time travel, and the Borg, a hated enemy. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the latest Enterprise (NCC 1701-E) follow a Borg ship back through Earth's history to the early 21st century and the aftermath of a nuclear war, where the Borg hope to prevent the first warp flight, so that some Vulcans passing nearby will never realize that humanity is worthy of their attention, the two species will never meet, and the Federation will never come into being. Earth can then be conquered by the Borg.The film takes few pauses for breath as an exciting and entertaining story pits the crew in a life or death struggle with their old enemy. An away team meets the inventor of warp drive (Zefram Cochrane, played by James Cromwell) and has to persuade and help him to go through with his experimental flight. Meanwhile, one of his associates, Lilly (a great performance by the always reliable Alfre Woodard) ends up on the Enterprise where she teams up with Picard to defeat a Borg attempt to take it over.Humor and action are well used, but, as always with ""Star Trek"", the film is at its best when we see the characters interact. A scene between Lilly and Picard, where she convinces him that only destroying the Enterprise can guarantee the Borg's defeat, rates as one of the best in the entire film series. The dialog is clever and the chemistry between them rings very true indeed.You'll probably get more out of this if you are familiar with ""Star Trek"", but even if you're not, you're in for an intriguing and absorbing ride.Recommended. Rating: 8/10.",Star Trek - First Contact
113,DrTuvok,Star Trek Horror??,8,24 April 2020,"The best thing about Star Trek is that it can fit into whatever genre or style the filmmakers want it to. We got Star Trek Kubrick-style (1), Star Trek Lucas-style (2), Star Trek comedy (4), Star Trek political thriller (6), and now with this we get Star Trek horror. The Borg are fantastic villains, and I kind of want them to bring them back in the reboots. It would be pretty hard to mess them up, unless I'm just being optimistic.Plus, they included the song ""Moonlight Becomes You"" from the Road to Morocco (one of the best comedies ever made). That just shows infinite class that all the recent Star Trek things have been lacking.",Star Trek - First Contact
114,scott-sw,The Next Generation's greatest voyage!,9,3 January 2008,"Star Trek the Next Generation mirrors the classic when they take to the big screen for the second time to combat their greatest enemy from an original episode. Star Trek First Contact has everything the Next Generation fan needs: action, suspense, star battles, introspection, a reference to classical literature, the original series ... and the Borg. The Borg have attacked Earth and the Enterprise D sails into battle. Picard uses his former assimilation to stop them, but a band of Borg escape to the mid 21st Century in order to stop First Contact. Apparently, this is the time when Zeframe Cochran makes his maiden warp voyage, triggering Earth's first contact with alien intelligent life forms. Now, it is up to Picard, Data, Riker and the rest of the crew to make sure the warp voyage happens, and that the Enterprise D is not assimilated into the Borg collective. Probably the best thing about First Contact is the action and star battles, handled well by director Jonathan Frakes. He is also able to go on an even keel in telling three stories at once. One is Picard's conflict with himself, a 21st Century Woman, and his crew. The second is Riker, Troi and Geordi making sure the reluctant Cochrane makes his flight. They deal with their shattered image of a 23rd century hero. The third is Data's dilemma as the Borg queen tempts him with humanity. Most Next Generation movies tend to favor two, three or maybe four characters over the rest. However, Frakes is able to work with story master Rick Berman to make sure every character is well motivated, characterized, and makes the plot work. This is my favorite of the Next Generation movies.",Star Trek - First Contact
115,GuyCC,"The Best of the ""Next Generation"" Films.",8,30 January 2000,"""Star Trek: First Contact"" is a great film for the Star Trek franchise as it offered a lot of tense, suspenseful moments, as well as the return of the best ""Next Generation"" enemies: The Borg.  The pacing and tone felt like a cross between the ""Alien"" series and George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"".  Relentless, innumerable and completely unemotional, the Borg rips through Picard's new Enterprise with ruthless efficiency.The warp flight story served as a means for the whole time-travel subplot, and while it offers the lighter moments in the film, the real action is found in space, as is the main entertainment.  Patrick Stewart's performance is great as a more take charge Picard (unlike the uncharacteristically weak Picard found in ""Generations""), the the other Next Gen cast is always a welcome addition.  (Yet Gates McFadden always gets such tiny parts in these films)  The special effects are great (looks even better on DVD), and the musical score is wonderful.  A few tiny continuity gripes here and there (I'm picky about details in films), but nowhere near enough to diminish the overall enjoyment of this movie.  Recommended.",Star Trek - First Contact
116,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Star Trek meets Aliens,7,31 March 2009,"Star Trek First Contact is the best entry with the Next Generation cast and the most successful attempt to combine Trek with an action movie formula so far. This is Jonathan Frakes feature film directorial debut and it's not bad for a first start! As the second film to directly link to an episode from the series, they wisely chose to make this a sequel of sorts to ""The Best of Both Worlds,"" one of the most critically acclaimed episodes in Trek and television history. Jean Luc Picard was captured and assimilated by the Borg, a race of cybernetic beings with a collective consciousness. The incident permanently scarred him and he still suffers from Post Traumatic Stress disorder, as well as a severe hatred for the Borg that will cloud his judgment. He frequently has flashbacks to the incident and he can even hear them when they're not there.First Contact starts with the premise that the Borg have begun another invasion of Earth, but the Enterprise has not been assigned to the front lines. When it looks like the Borg are breaking through the Federation defenses, Picard disobeys orders and travels to Earth at Maximum Warp. The Borg have a trick up their sleeve that nobody predicted: they travel back through time to the mid twenty first century, in an attempt to stop the scientist Zephram Cochran (James Cromwell) from making contact with an alien race. If they succeed, the Borg will be able to assimilate Earth easily, because the human race will not have the technology to fight them off. It is up to the crew of the Enterprise to repair Cochran's ship and fight off the Borg that transported over to the Enterprise.Jonathan Frakes borrows heavily from James Cameron's Aliens. The action scenes are exceptionally thrilling, largely due to the Borg's ability to become impervious to phasers. The pressure on the crew keeps building as more and more crew members are assimilated. The Borg steadily gain more ground on the Enterprise until it looks like the crew's only option is to self-destruct the ship and evacuate. The Borg were always creepy villains, but this time they really made the make-up and prosthetics look realistic. Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen (another element borrowed from Aliens) who controls the collective. She attempts to seduce Data in more ways than one, but she mainly appeals to his desire to become human. I have a love/hate relationship with the Queen. Krige makes for one of the more memorable villains of the series, but the concept of the character contradicts everything we knew about the Borg. She is essentially their leader, but the Borg in the series did not have a leader. They were a hive mind with no hierarchical structure. When she dies, all of the Borg on the ship die with her, which was a little too convenient.The Next Generation films were primarily about Picard and Data, but First Contact did a better job utilizing the supporting characters. Riker, Geordi, and Troi assist Cochran with rebuilding his ship. Cochran panics a few times when he learns just how important he is. What really makes this movie a winner is the trauma Captain Picard goes through and how his new friend from the twenty-first century, Lily (Alfre Woodard) helps him get through it. Picard becomes almost sadistic in his fight against the Borg, and he refuses to listen to reason when the ship is all but lost. He gets into an intense argument with Worf that almost ruins their friendship. In the best scene of the film, Lily tries to convince Picard to blow up the ship, to which Picard responds by unleashing all of his bottled up rage and smashes a mirror with a phaser. Stewart succeeded in delivering an angry, tortured, and intimidating performance. Lily's accusation that Picard was becoming like Captain Ahab was very clever, since the only other character in the series to be compared to Ahab was Khan.Star Trek First Contact proved The Next Generation cast could stand on its own. It is unfortunate that they focused so much on Data and Picard, since they could have done more with the other characters. First Contact is an effective Sci-fi action thriller with great performances all around.",Star Trek - First Contact
117,javiergarcon,In the year 2000 We eliminated all ICBM's We no longer use them,5,11 January 2021,2021 Review: This movie is no longer relevant and the thought that Zefram Cochrane used a ICBM to build a warp capable ship is pure science fiction! Anyone with an education know that the only rockets that can travel in space are actual rockets launched at Space X and NASA. If Star Trek did its homework they should of had Zefram Cochrane base of operation near Houston Texas or Port Canaveral Florida. Another questionable scene in First Contact is how did they Land the rocket if it didn't have legs like Space X? Seriously so much context is missing and the devil is in the details. Sorry but the new Star Trek's are way better than the old and better equipped not feeding the scenes with fake news or missing news.,Star Trek - First Contact
118,Figgiedan,"Move over Shatner, they did it.",9,3 December 1998,As much as I like the first 7 movies (fave being Kahn) - the new crew blew the other flicks out of the water with thismovie. Here's to another 8 Trek films with Picard at the helm!,Star Trek - First Contact
119,greggman,Blinded by fandom,6,2 December 2001,"*spoilers*I don't understand why people liked this movie so much.  It broke so many rules.Other people pointed out that the Zefram Cochrane in this movie bares no resemblance to the original Zefram Cochrane from the original series in terms of character.  Why they did this is beyond me but it was lame and detracted from the movie.  Yes of course with Wrath of Kahn the same actor was alive but that's not my point.  Kahn in Wrath of Kahn acted like the same person from other original TV series.  Cochrane not at all.More stupid was the way they changed the Borg into just a normal enemy. What made the Borg so cool since they were first introduced in the series were that they were like robots, relentlessly coming to get you, no stopping them, no reasoning with them, they had a one track mind on top of which as they were all part of a larger brain it was impossible to negociate with them.Then in this movie they ruin all that wonderful difference by adding a Borg queen who is sexy, emotional and how can be seduced by Captain Picard.  So, no the Borg are no longer interesting, they are just like any other Star Trek race.  Once the Queen is added they become no different from Romulans, Klingons or Cardasseans.  Lame.Finally there was the let down of no battle.  The trailers showed Picard screaming ""THE LINE MUST BE DRAWN HERE!"" which just sounds so cool like he was going to kick so much booty but then in the movie we wait and wait and wait and how does it finally end?  Data punches a can.  Can you say ultimate anti climax?I wanted to like this movie.  I like Star Trek.  I loved the trailer but the actual movie just didn't deliver.6 of 10",Star Trek - First Contact
120,joncheskin,TNG Finally Does Trek,7,7 June 2016,"BIAS ALERT--I am a fan of the Original Series, and so inclined by my bias to pan this movie. I have watched episodes of the Next Generation and have always thought it was significantly inferior to the original. To me, Troi, Riker and Beverly were always rather pretentious and unrealistic, and I always thought, man why would I want to sit through two hours of this stuff? Then, one night I was surfing the Neflix and found the movie. I thought--tacky entertainment? Then I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes--89% Really? So I watched it, and lo and behold, they finally did a real Star Trek movie.The plot is the return of the Borg. After blasting through the Earth's defenses, the Borg plan is to time-warp back to the 21st century and kill Zephram Cochran, the inventor of the warp drive. This is not only the most important technological invention in human history, but also the most socially significant, since the first warp flight led to the discovery of earth by Alien Beings--First Contact. The Enterprise chases the small Borg ship appointed for the task, and winds up back in time; the crew has to convince Cochran to take the first warp flight, and also fight off a Borg boarding party that is taking over the Enterprise. The movie is basically an action flick.And a good one it is. For some reason, the usual clunky writing and acting are not in evidence. The film is well-paced, exciting, and even a bit creepy. Honestly, however, the plot is still a bit derivative--the idea of time traveling to restore the present is a staple of the original series, in such episodes as the City on the Edge of Forever and Tomorrow Was Yesterday. And the hand-to-hand battle aboard the Enterprise is clearly derivative of the original series's Day of the Dove. Nonetheless, the elements are recombined pretty effectively, and the movie is exciting. I will say that Marina Sirtis is still awful in the movie, doing perhaps the least convincing drunk scene in the history of film. But at least there is no Wesley Crusher!",Star Trek - First Contact

The dive into Borg psyche was deep and at the time, unexpected. Stewart's usually unflappable captain now brooding like Ahab in space was a welcomed change.Rookie film director Frakes made for a great first effort, having helmed a few episodes and possessing a knowledge of the franchise only Nimoy and Shatner before him could have had, but with a better Trek depth of scope.

Spoilers contained within***After successfully bringing Picard (Patrick Stewart) to the center seat in Star Trek: Generations (1994), We are immediately given what is still considered today to be the best film of that franchise Star Trek: First Contact.The entire crew is reassembled aboard the new Sovereign class Enterprise (NCC-1701-E),Including Lt. Hawk (Neal McDonough).The Borg are back, and Capt. Picard is understandably miffed. After handing Starfleet their hat in combat Picard disobeys direct orders and swiftly defeats the Borg. Except of course, for the one Sphere that travels back in time to completely alter the history of Earth. Watching Picard chase down his nemesis is entertaining.The script is a simple rabbit and the actors chase it with enthusiasm. Jonathan Frakes (Falcon Crest, Clockstoppers)Masterfully directs his debut big screen campaign in Star Trek.A supporting cast out of this galaxy , Such as James Cromwell (Cochran),Alfrie Woodard (Lily) and Alice Krige as the evil Borg Queen , carry the show well.

I heard that Star Trek fans were disappointed by this movie, but I do not understand why, since I was not as a non-Star-Trek-fan. I recommend this movie to action fans.

127,GLanoue,Best of Star Trek,10,1 January 2011,"This is by far the best of the Trek films, I think. The chemistry of the regulars has never been better, thanks to Frakes' fast-paced directing, and the addition of Alice Krige as the strangely seductive Borg Queen and Alfre Woodard as Zefram Cochrane's significant other (and a perfect foil for Picard -- who else can hold their own against Stewart?) just added to my pleasure. This is the secret to successful Trek films, a wonderful ensemble where Shatner's ego, Stewart's Shakespearian angst, and Mulgrew's channelling of Xena (let's forget about poor Scott Bakula) are perfectly balanced by Spock's emotional remoteness, Worf's leonine courage and 7 of 9's (or, as basement dwellers everywhere called her, 36 of D) fragility. It really isn't hard to make a decent movie when all the elements are in place. Everyone here is a journeyman, not an acteur or auteur. Good script, solid acting, competent but unflashy directing. First Contact has it all, and the Trek franchise has never had a better enemy than the Borg, especially these Borg, since we can see their genesis from assimilated Entreprise personnel, and Krige actually makes a solid case that the Borg may be a superior ""species"". Watch for a small role by Robert Picardo, The Doctor (Emergency Medical Hologram) in Voyager. RIP, Star Trek, at least you gave us this one little jewel.",Star Trek - First Contact
128,The_Other_Snowman,Alice Krige Looks Like This In Real Life!,7,27 June 2006,"Many people believe this is the best of the ten Trek films, probably because the special effects are the most advanced, and it has the most violence. It's definitely the best of the Next Gen movies, and not a bad action flick, but it doesn't really feel like Star Trek to me.There are two parallel stories that play out in ""First Contact,"" and sometimes it feels like two separate movies. In Movie A, Picard and the crew of the Enterprise, having traveled to the 21st century in pursuit of a Borg ship, must defend the Enterprise as it is assimilated from within by the evil Borg Queen. It's a lot like ""Aliens,"" but without the cussing and acid blood. The corridors of the ship are dark and foreboding, the Borg are unemotional and quite scary, and fighting them seems hopeless. The Borg Queen, however, never really comes across clearly because it's obvious the writers just had no idea what she was supposed to be.Movie A is dark and exciting. Movie B, on the other hand, is light and fluffy, and a little slack. The more comically-oriented members of the crew beam down to 21st century Earth to help Zefram Cochrane repair his groundbreaking warp ship in time for a historic rendezvous with the Vulcans, and have to convince him to become the heroic character he is in the history books. Cochrane is understandably skeptical, not to mention drunk on tequila.The characters on the ground are oblivious to what's going on in space, so the two parallel plots are entirely separated by tone and content. One is dark and serious, the other light and funny. The writers tried too hard to make their movie appeal to everyone, and they end up with a bit of a mish-mash. The comic relief is forced and not very funny, and the action sequences on board ship lose some of their power once you realize how clean they are. After all, there's no blood in the future, and only extras get killed.Picard and Data get the most attention, with a few scenes reserved for Worf and a cameo from ""Voyager's"" holographic doctor. The other characters don't contribute much more than background exposition. The show was based solidly on its ensemble cast, so it's a little jarring to have that ensemble reduced to a hero and his sidekick.",Star Trek - First Contact

130,JamesMitchell451,One of the best Trek films ever made,9,22 September 2013,"People act like the Star Trek Reboot and its sequel are the only times Star Trek has veered into the genre of straight up action: Those people however seem to forget about this installment. Star Trek: First Contact's plot is that Captain Picard and the crew of the Enterprise must stop the Borg from altering history. Now, I'm going to let you know right off the bat that the plot is the weakest part.Despite it being well told, it contains numerous plot holes that are kind of hard not to notice. And yet, that is overshadowed by the great acting, smart dialogue, terrific special effects, and phenomenal action scenes. First Contact is also one of the darkest of the Star Trek films, and it works well as the pacing picks up and the film gets more and more intense to the point where you are on the edge of your seat. First Contact stands as the ONLY good Next Generation film, and it is even better than Wrath of Khan.",Star Trek - First Contact
131,skiop,Star Trek: First Sellout,4,4 July 2006,"I've never liked this entry in the long-running series, though I've seen it many times. One time I watched it on ABC, where it was claimed that this is the movie that would make anybody a Trekkie. Largely that's true: this is a glossy, superficial, cheesy and dull actioner that's the furthest a Star Trek movie has been from the original vision.After destroying the Enterprise-D in the lackluster (but superior) Generations, our crew has been given the state-of-the-art Enterprise-E. When the Borg, a race of cybernetic beings who want to assimilate humankind, start a war with the Federation, the Enterprise-E, the best defense against the Borg, is assigned to monitor the Romulan Neutral Zone. But Captain Picard breaks orders and destroys a Borg cube. The Borg then go back in time to assimilate Earth, so our crew enters the temporal wake to stop them.Back in the 21st century, they have to make sure that drunkard Zefram Cochran makes first contact with Vulcans. The 21st-century characters are really annoying, both the vulgar Cochran and the aggressive, foul-mouthed Lily Sloane.Meanwhile, the crew still aboard the Enterprise has to contend with the Borg, who have hijacked engineering and kidnapped Data.There are many poor attempts at humor here. It just doesn't work. Additionally, the film often lags, especially the Enterprise scenes. The filmmakers can never seem to get straight what exactly the Borg's capabilities are. Are they organic or synthetic? They can survive in space but not being blown up?Worf returns and we get a glimpse of DS9's Defiant, but the scene of him entering the bridge is one of the most cringe-worthy parts. But the scenes with Data and the Borg Queen surely almost approach it. Also, Lily seems all too willing to reference Moby Dick, though she hadn't read it.The most compelling thing here is supposed to be Picard's internal personal anger toward the Borg, similar to Khan's toward Kirk in the second entry. But this aspect is skimmed over and replaced with violence. And there's plenty of violence here: eye gouging, neck breaking, limb severing, shootdowns, skin melting and other gruesome stuff added for the name of marketability.And Riker and Troi defy the prime directive. What's with that?",Star Trek - First Contact
132,jjgooner,Lots of Potential But Fails To Create The Epic Sense That It Should,6,1 July 2013,"Star Trek: First Contact**1/2 (out of 4)111 mins/ 12Cast: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell, Alice Krige, Neal McDonoughDirector: Jonathan FrakesPlot: The Enterprise D crew has to travel in time to face off against the evil Borg, who go way back with Captain Picard, as they try to prevent Earth's first contact with extra-terrestrial life.JJ's Verdict: Star Trek: First Contact starts off bold and proud with the theme tune playing over some well-made credits. With its reputation as the best Trek of them all, after reading the plot, you would expect bold and proud action that has a meaning to save the world. However, although we do get good action, it never seems through the camera or the characters eyes that they are fighting to save the universe and ends up just being about Picard fighting his demons and defeating the Borg for a personal achievement. In First Contact, the Enterprise crew are forced to time travel back to the mid-21st century as the Borg try to stop humans having first contact with aliens. We then find out that Captain Picard is dealing with demons once again because he was once taken in and transformed to become one of them. From here we get two groups of characters. The first are Riker and Geordi on Earth trying to make sure Zefram Cochran to fulfil his destiny and make first contact with aliens. Zefram is a cynical drunkard who is not too dissimilar to the character Dr. McCoy who was so loved by Trek fans back with the original crew. James Cromwell, portraying Cochran, brings a much needed freshness and quirkiness to the picture and gives us a very likable character. Back on the Enterprise we have an 'Alien' style survival against the Borg lead by Picard and Worf. Patrick Stewart, who of course plays Picard, once again brings his cool, commanding and cooling presence to the screen and if the state of the world really did depend on him, I'd be very happy indeed. All of these scenes have some great action and well-made chases but given its source material, feels a long way from the more human elements of the Original Crew's tenure. Sure, I love good action but it just doesn't feel like a 'Trek' film to me. Despite this, one scene at the start in which Picard disobeys orders from Starfleet is almost identical to one in Kirk and Co.'s final outing back in 1991 and feels awfully cringing.Another problem with the 'Alien' like scenes, are the aliens themselves, the Borg. Although Alice Krige puts in a creditable performance as the Borg, it is the Borg's motives which had me confused. To have power of the world, they are trying to stop human's first contact with aliens but surely, even if they stopped it then, there will be more opportunities to contact aliens. More Borg problems are that despite inhabiting their ship, the Borg will only kill the crew if they see them as a threat, and the crew will only kill the Borg if the Borg see the crew as a threat. Even when they are standing metres away form each other, they will only shoot if they sense that they are in danger. Why? I, unfortunately, cannot answer. The films visuals are the best out of all previous Trek films and so are the big-scoped space battles. More positives in the film are the dry wit in the script and great mix of seriousness and comic relief. However, this does have its downside because as the danger to Picard gets more serious, the comic relief given by James Cromwell increases which causes for a great sense of awkwardness as the two cut from one to another. Despite not being a 'Trek' film in the sense of the word, First Contact gives us an entertaining last twenty minutes, to be a decent but certainly watchable film.",Star Trek - First Contact
133,anifanmc,Trek at its best,9,29 December 2008,"Trek has seen some pretty big variety in terms of success in its feature films. We have the amazing (Wrath of Khan) and the absolutely horrifying (Star Trek: The Motion Picture). There's also the average (ST: Generations), mostly fanboy-pandering films which leave casual viewers out of the loop. Then, you have films like this, which have the double result of giving the franchise life and telling a great story. Perhaps it's no secret that good writing is what makes Trek more so than good FX, but when the two are combined in a spectacular manner, it is none the worse for the franchise.The story continues the saga of the TNG characters, but doesn't make it so obtuse as to cut new viewers out of the loop. They make it clear who is the villain, who is the hero, and provide all the background necessary to watch the film. In terms of continuity, it picks up three or four years after ST: Generations, on a brand new Enterprise (NCC-1701E), captained by almost the same crew as the Enterprise-D. The film is fast paced, and jumps into the plot almost immediately. The stakes are incredibly dire and very close to home - the Borg have begun an invasion of the Federation, starting with Earth. The Enterprise is initially called away from the battle, but Picard disobeys orders and returns, using his experience with the Borg to destroy the cube attacking Earth.Within minutes, however, the Borg escape and travel back in time to 2063 - the year in which humans discovered the warp travel that allowed them to exceed the speed of light, and on the date when it was first tested - and brought them into first contact with the Vulcans, revolutionizing their society and ushering in the utopia of the Federation. Picard pursues them back, planning to stop their plans to assimilate Earth and change the future.The story is written by Jonathan Frakes, who is known for being a superb writer as well as an actor. He writes a great deal of character into his story, notably around Picard and the inventor of the warp drive, Zefram Cochrane, who has been alluded to repeatedly throughout TNG (and seen in TOS). Cochrane is portrayed by James Cromwell and is, far from being a visionary and a saint (as he claims the 24th century looks at him) is an alcoholic and driven by desire for money, not for the betterment of mankind. Yet, he changes throughout the film, and both Cromwell's fantastic acting and Frakes' script make it clear where and why he changes his views.Picard, on the other hand, is a different sort of character, who, with the invasion of the Borg, is finally beginning to truly feel the trauma that was done to his mind and body by being assimilated into their collective seven years prior. His infamous bearing and restraint is cracking heavily under the strain of his anger and desire for revenge. In one of the most famous scenes of the movie, a 21st century woman, Lily Sloane, confronts him with brutal honesty, comparing him to the obsessed Captain Ahab of Moby Dick, that the Borg have become his white whale. He succumbs to anger and realizes that she has been right all along. The dialogue, acting and complete honesty of the cast make his emotions seem realistic and terrifying.This is not just a good star trek film, it's a great film - period. For people who wish to be introduced into the Star Trek franchise, this is a great place to start, as it embodies what Star Trek is truly about. The battle sequences, based in land, space, and ship to ship, are at their best as far as Star Trek goes, and the movie's pace doesn't ever truly slow down.",Star Trek - First Contact

136,MovieFanGuyy,First Contact is easily the best of the Next Generation films!,9,22 September 2006,"Star Trek First Contact, released back in 1996, is easily one of the best Star Trek films and definitely the best film featuring the cast of the highly popular Next Generation television series.Instead of the usual technology based dialoge Star Trek plot which plagued the other three Next Generation films, Generations, Insurrection, and Nemesis, First Contact, follows a fairly linear plot, involving time travel and of course, stopping the most popular of Star Trek villains, the dreaded Borg.Jonathan Frakes, who plays Commander Riker, does a terrific job in his first feature film, while not only knowing his cast members very well, he also is able to bring out the best performances from each of them. A pattern which did not follow on the ninth film, Insurrection.Terrific visual effects, a great musical score by the late Jerry Goldsmith, and a commanding performance by Patrick Stewart, makes this easily the best Star Trek film since The Undiscovered Country.Three and a half stars out of four!",Star Trek - First Contact

Maybe that makes me a bad person, or less of a Trekkie, but that's okay. Really, the only series that was truly worth watching was TNG. And to me, this IS the best Star Trek movie there is. Plain and simple.Those of us who are good TNG fans remember back when Captain Picard was captured and assimilated by the Borg, right? Man, what a crazy cliffhanger for that season. Picard is a Borg? Yikes. I know I was waiting for the new season on pins and needles. Anyway, the movie opens with Picard having some flashbacks from his little assimilation encounter. Then he wakes up, only to find himself in another nightmare. Then he wakes up for good.So it looks like the Borg are back on the move and ready to attack Earth. The Enterprise gets orders to stay away from the fight. Because of Picard's experience with the Borg, they don't want unstable elements in the situation. Eventually they disobey the order and join the fight anyhow. Picard takes command of the fleet and destroys the Borg cube. But a sphere ejects moments before its destruction. The Enterprise pursues, but then the sphere creates a vortex and vanishes into it. Time travel! So of course, the Enterprise charges in.When they get to the past, they find the sphere firing on a missile complex somewhere in Montana. They destroy the sphere, figure out where they are, when they are, why the Borg were firing at Montana (besides that they hate Americans), and the answers are as follows. It's the middle of the 21st century, and the missile complex is where Zefram Cochrane was building his warp ship. The launch tomorrow was supposed to be when a ship full of Vulcans which were cruising past detect the warp signature, alter course, and check out Earth. First contact with a human race. Hence the name of the movie.So at this point everything looks mostly okay, right? Borg are dead, just gotta help get Cochrane and his crew back on task and get things ready to go again, right? Wrong. Well, while the shields were down after the time travel, a few of the Borg might have beamed over to the Enterprise, and they're busily taking over the Enterprise from the inside.The mission for the Borg is still to stop first contact. The mission for the Enterprise is to save their ship and to keep first contact on schedule. Truly, this is a classy movie.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",Star Trek - First Contact

However, a small part of it escapes and plot a course directly to Earth. The Enterprise chases it and enters a time distortion created by the Borg. They end up in the mid 21st century, their only chance of stopping the Borg from assimilating Earth being to help Zefram Cochrane make his famous first faster than light travel to the stars...The music made by the late Jerry Goldsmith was amazing, special effects were awesome, acting performances were great.If you like Independence Day, or Star Trek, you will like this one.Star Trek: First Contact gets 10 stars.",Star Trek - First Contact

In fact, there are more laugh-out-loud moments than I recall in any other ST film. And it's always fun to see dynamic actors like James Cromwell (""Babe"") and Alfre Woodard in roles from their younger days.
I have one overriding question and it concerns the soundtrack. Which one of these actors (or producers or the director) is the Sun Records fan? I was shocked to hear an extended guitar solo from Roy Orbison's ""Ooby Dooby."" It wasn't the original Sun Record from 1956, but it was an almost note-for-note recreation. Too bad they didn't use the original, but it was still startling to hear this bit of pop culture resurrected 40 years later.",Star Trek - First Contact
140,annahudak-70828,"Well made, but not for me",7,9 May 2021,"First off I want to say, this movie is quite well made, but it isn't for me. So, I just wanted to clarify my review score and the perspective being brought to the table here. I am strictly speaking on how well it's made, not any enjoyment I got out of the movie, because I got none (too many horror elements for my taste). Anyway, on with the review:This movie did a great job at truly making you fear the Borg. They seemed menacing and like a true threat. I would say the biggest threat faced by any of the Enterprise crews in any of the movies. The Borg Queen was downright menacing all on her own, especially her little philosophical back-and-forth with Data. It really played well into Data's on-going storyline of wanting to be more human, and we actually do see him becoming more human, and the results of that.I love Cochrane. He is a drunken creep who accidentally ends up a great figure of history, and the knowledge of that terrifies him. Just like it should. If someone where to come from the future and tell me that high schools would be named in my honor, and statues of myself would be made, I would want to do anything but what made me famous. I also loved his talk about how history changes a lot of facts and mythologizes people to a ridiculous degree. Anyway, loved that storyline.I also really enjoyed Picard's storyline. He felt he had so much to prove after having once been assimilated by the Borg. So, when he has the chance, he goes all out for revenge, despite the fact that he's not only dooming himself, but humanity as well. So, when that woman who they brought on board (don't remember her name) went off on Picard, it truly felt like a turning point and felt impactful. I will never forget her saying, ""Ok Captain Ahab."" The comment that forced Picard to grow. The one that made him realize how foolish he was being. Picard's arc was brilliantly done.Anyway, even though I didn't enjoy the film at all, the stories this movie told I won't forget. Easily the best told story in any Star Trek film, and that is what made it so good, despite the fact that I didn't enjoy it.",Star Trek - First Contact
141,RandomTask-AP,Perfect Future Imperfect (spoilers),8,13 April 2004,"One staple institution of Hollywood is the Star Trek series of TV shows and films. As with anything that becomes a day-to-day phenomenon, the various ""Treks"" have fallen into neglect assuming that its loyal group followers of sometimes religious fervor will swallow everything from bad writing to cheesy sets. Fortunately, this eighth installment in the film series ended the trend. While doubling in his role as the second in command of the Enterprise crew, Johnathan Frakes steps in as director and lends both dark vision and well-placed humor to the film. Although admittedly a commercial venture playing off other science fiction films such as ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", and Leonard Nemoy's ""Star Trek IV"", ""Star Trek: First Contact"" creates an adventure that is enjoyable and exciting.Defying direct orders, the crew of the 24th century U.S.S. Enterprise returns to Earth to help defeat an invading force of a cyborg race known as The Borg. When their invasion attempt appears to be a losing battle, the Borg travel back in time to conquer the Earth when it is defenseless. The heroes follow the invaders back to the mid 21st century where they must help the injured human race prepare to make its first contact with friendly extra terrestrial life. The Borg make their way aboard the Enterprise, and begin converting it and its crew for their own purposes. The inner struggles of the cast include a thirst for revenge in the Captain who was almost converted by the Borg, a great discomfort with becoming a historical figure in the inventor who will make first contact, and the temptation of becoming human for the android who wants nothing more.At its worst, ""Star Trek"" is entertaining science fiction, however, it is best at commenting on the daily question of how we determine what is best for ourselves in contrast to what others want us to do. The Borg have been ""assimilating"" every world, culture, and individual in an attempt to correct natural flaws and force them into the rigid perfection of mechanized, ordered life. In an attempt to help the future, the crew of the 24th Century pile upon the inventor, Dr. Cochran, the responsibility of the human race's good fortune of the coming years. Both groups think they can provide a better choice for the people they impose upon, only to find resistance to a life without choice. As the characters face their various challenges, they all find that decisions cannot be made out of blind faith or spite, but rather by discovering what their own reasons are. Then, after finding what the situation holds for them, a decision can be made that will bring about an end that the character can live with.Director Jonathan Frakes does not let special effects rule the screen and uses the camera to create a sense of suspense not usually found in the Trek series. As the Borg begin to assimilate the Enterprise and crew members are attacked, their presence is made more terrifying with the camera placed in their perspective allowing the audience to experience only the shock and fear of the crew's reactions. At times, the effects and set design of the Star Trek series have not always been up to par with other science-fiction films, however, in First Contact, both elements are well-done only adding to the credibility of the story. Not only the obvious special effects of laser blasts and time rifts make the film extraordinary visually, but the more subtle effects add to the film as well. When three members of the crew step out onto the ship's hull, the scenery of space and the expansiveness of the ship are impressive along with the subjective shots from inside helmets as characters maneuver through weightlessness. Although his resume has only been peppered with success since, Frakes' directorial debut is one of tremendous skill at creating thrills.With a firm plot, fresh directing, and stunning visuals, ""First Contact"" is an exciting film. This film elevates itself from being just another money - making sequel to an entertaining science-fiction film with a well - articulated message.8 out of 10",Star Trek - First Contact

143,speedy-droid,A Great Character Study of Picard... With One Huge Flaw,7,13 March 2015,"I liked ""First Contact"" instantly.I had always hoped that someone would do the Zefram Cochrane story, and this caught me by surprise. I thought the main plot was particularly well-done, and deserves a ""9"". Cromwell did an outstanding job of portraying Cochrane as just a regular guy who had a brilliant idea, and didn't want to be famous, or any kind of ""hero."" I liked that little ""twist"" on Star Trek history.Unfortunately, the whole ""Borg"" subplot just detracted from the Cochrane story. I would have happily settled for a shorter movie or any other excuse for the Enterprise to travel into the past. ""Borg"" is just Old and Worn Out. It is now, and it was in 1996. It almost ruined the movie for me.A couple of particularly ""low points"":1) Picard calls Worf a ""Coward"" -- Totally out-of-character. I can't imagine the Picard character ever doing that, Borg or not.2) The Holodeck and Dixon Hill -- Worn Out, totally self-serving, and completely unnecessary.However, the movie did turn out O.K., with a few great lines and scenes.1) Lily: ""Borg? Sounds Swedish.""2) Lily: ""It's my first Ray Gun.""3) Data: ""Resistance... Is Futile!"" (probably the best line Brent Spiner ever had in Star Trek... delivered perfectly -- I guess the re-hash of the Borg story line had a purpose, after all)4) Troi: ""He wouldn't even talk to me unless I had a drink with him. And then, it took three shots of something called 'tequila' just to find out that he was the one we're looking for. And I've spent the last twenty minutes trying to keep his hands off me.

The plot of this movie 100% gold, the battle scenes are well coordinated and are good fun. A strong script and featuring Picard's worse enemy The Borg! I've watched this movie over and over again. Every time I think its brilliant, TNG really got there best moments in this film.Jon Frakes really got it right in this film, unlike ""Thunderbirds"" stick with trek JF! In conclusion this is (in my opinion) the best sci-fi movie ever. If you are looking for a deep, solid and action sci-fi. First contact is your movie.

147,jhuni_x,You might like this film if you are beyond reason,1,9 October 2010,"However, if you are reasonable, let me point out two ridiculous things that firmly set Star Trek in the area of fantasy rather then science fiction: the Q continuum and time travel (the basis of this movie).Time travel is ridiculous in too many ways to count. The first of which is if it is possible where are the time travelers? If it were possible it would be the most devastating thing ever. The first group to invent it would go back in time to when everyone else was still bacteria and conquer the galaxy.The way the Borg would go about using their time travel technology is they would go back as far in time as possible and upload to the earlier hive mind their knowledge of time travel, futuristic technology, and enemy cultures. The Borg would then construct several more time machines and go back in time again with fleets of spheres and conquer the galaxy and then the universe.And if those points weren't enough, what makes the time travel in this film completely ridiculous is that by going back in time and meeting the humans of the past they would've completely altered the future and the entire structure of the federation and the Star Trek universe, but that didn't seem to happen.Additionally, this film completely ruined the Borg. In the Best of Both Worlds they seemed to be an irresistible force of nature, however, in this film the real identity of the Borg is revealed, they are actually a bunch of mindless idiotic zombie beings without any goals like perfection. And they have a queen too now, what is up with that? The queen serves no practical purpose and she has nothing to do with the Borg philosophy. She was just stuck in there as a plot device and to further transform the Borg into a silly joke, not to be taken seriously. In essence the Borg died with this film.And what the heck is the Borg queen doing talking? I thought the Borg were beyond that. Sound is an incredibly inefficient means of communication, it is slow, it cannot travel across long distances or across space (which raises the question of how do they hear external sounds on the enterprise? Do they have artificial sound?), it is hard to decipher, and you cannot transfer very much data with it. Therefore the Borg use more efficient mediums. Namely they use radio wave communication like what we use today with the Internet except they extended into interstellar space by using subspace channels.In conclusion if you intend to watch this film shut off your mind as a lack of critical thinking we make this film far more enjoyable.",Star Trek - First Contact

151,JRGTrek,It wasn't bad.,10,1 December 1998,"Compared to The Wrath of Kahn and The Undiscovered Country, this one comes in 3rd.  While it was a good movie since the Borg were in it and we got a chance to see how Vulcans and Humans first met, there are a few problems with it.First of all, you'd think a shot from a borg ship would be a lot more accurate and more destructive, they should have been able to destroy the whole missile complex.  Second of all where did Picard get all of this revenge and anger from?  I thought he dealt with it in ""I, Borg"", I mean he had a chance there to destroy all the Borg there ever was, but he dealt with it his anger and revenge, and let them live.  Plus how didn't the Vulcans pick up the Enterprise?  Ok, the moon's gravity obsucured the warp drive, but what about the quantum torpedoes and the destruction of the Borg Sphere.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but there are several flaws that just don't make sense.",Star Trek - First Contact

Although I'm a huge Star Wars fan, I'm not afraid to admit that Trek has its strengths and weaknesses when it comes to comparing the two, but I'm not going to today. Not in this review.You know what it's about and what happens, so let's get to it. What did I like? Well, the dogfight at the beginning could've been a hell of a lot longer, but it was nice while it lasted. The dark edginess and entire feel/look of the movie was something to watch. My congrats go out to John Frakes for doing a great job in his first main stream directing job.The crew of the Enterprise-E perform as great as usual, and the supporting cast also hit their marks right on time. Other congrats go out to ILM for bringing us another great effects film.

I would give this section of the movie a 10 out of 10 easily. The tension and action is incredible and the performances of the cast are outstanding.On the other hand, Zefram Cochrane is completely unbelievable as the person who invents the first ""faster than light"" engine on this planet. He acts like a fool and seems to be drunk about 90% of the time. He is also completely different from the character of Zefram Cochrane in the Original Series episode ""Metamorphosis"". (Who appeared to be reasonably intelligent and believable as the man who invented warp drive)Even if he was intelligent enough to do this, how can a few people living in a remote area of Montana build such a ship? Look at all the resources that NASA use just to launch a space shuttle into orbit. To do anything like this would require all the resources of NASA and billions of dollars. Zefram Cochrane doesn't appear to have either of these things.Overall I gave First Contact 7. For the Borg sections I would give it 10. For the Zefram Cochrane scenes I would give it 4.In short, watch it for the Borg scenes as they are outstanding. Just ignore the bits with Zefram Cochrane!",Star Trek - First Contact

155,Kylic,Chalk up one for Trek!,9,13 January 2000,"""Star Trek First Contact"" is by far one of the best sci-fi films of all time... right up there with ""The Wrath of Kahn"" and ""The Undiscovered Country"". Jonathan Frakes one again proves that he has the right stuff to sit in the director's chair (Unfortunately, I can't say the same for ""Insurrection"" but that's another review). Plus the film restores my faith in the Borg as the ultimate villains; whereas ST: Voyager has degraded them into incompetent, bubbling, buffoons (a la, ""Dark Frontier"")!As for acting, Patrick Stewart delivers his best performance of his trek career (so far); as well as the supporting cast: Spiner, Dorn, Cromwell, Woodard, etc... However, Krige's roll as the Borg Queen fell rather flat. But overall a must see for trek and non trek fan alike!Rating: 9",Star Trek - First Contact
156,connmoore,Highly flawed and rather inane movie,4,15 July 2010,"I honestly cannot get why supposed Star Trek fans like this movie. If ever there was a Star Trek movie that spit in the face of everything Star Trek was supposed to be about, its this one.The major issue is the entire Zephram Cochran storyline. Cochran is known, to long time fans of the series, as the man who invents warp drive. The device that gives the ""trek"" to Star Trek. So the lame producers and writers of this movie have decided that we have to see how it happened. What they do is take the supposed heroism and creativity of Cochran and toss them in the toilet.Cochran ends up inventing nothing. The Enterprise crew comes back in time and does all the work for him. Cochran creates nothing and does nothing. So there is the initial warp drive trip to take. Instead of the implied solo flight of Cochran, Geordi and Ryker go along with him. No reason for this is ever given.So we have a supposed hero who knows for a fact that his flight is going to work, and people from the future have come back to take care of all the work. What exactly is heroic or interesting about that? Its lame...completely lame.Never mind the sudden need to have the Vulcans already running around in space warping wherever they want. What that gives us is some interesting contradictions regarding why the hell would the United Federation of Planets be based on Earth after this? Why would the center of the Star Trek universe be on a backwards planet that is literally hundreds of years behind the advanced universe? It would be like turning New Guinea into the home of the United Nations.This is all ignored, because the simple minded mouth breathers that created this crap movie just wanted it to ""look cool"". They don't care about logic or achievement. All they care about is making James Cromwell act like a drunken idiot for comedic effect. If you are a Star Trek fan that likes this movie, shame on you for being as unthinking as the people that made it.",Star Trek - First Contact
157,Borg7o9,"Needed to be better, with more of a sense of resistance",6,16 December 1998,"Apparently, resistance is futile.  Paramount is content to just sit back and let the specialized few run the business, while the fans call for something more.  Obviously there should be some middle ground, but staying to the far right is always a bad idea.  I thought it wasn't even close to Trek ideals. Good effects, good dialog - but totally implausible, with a bad replacement for the character of Zephran Cochran (see how the TOS character acted and compare), and terrible lack of introduction to the new Enterprise.  I was highly disappointed to see another Revenge-Trek (ala ""The Wrath of Khan""). ""All Good Things..."" ranks as ten times better than this film in terms of thinking out what is happening.",Star Trek - First Contact

There are no slow moments, the dialogue and scenes are just right. The Borg are the creepiest, best villain in the Star Trek universe. The Borg queen was excellent.The anti-hero Cochrain was a nice different spin. Filling in the series plot gaps of where warp technology was discovered was an excellent device. Showing Captain Picard with weaknesses added depth. The acting was excellent. The ending makes you pump your fist.I have nothing but good things to say about this film.",Star Trek - First Contact
159,aegoss,Borg queen is anomalous - or is it?,7,24 May 2008,"This is not a great film, but it is a good one. My measure of this is that I have not seen it for some years but I remember much of it quite vividly, unlike some other supposedly ""better"" films. Some parts could have been improved, I'm sure, and the logic is sometimes wobbly, but the art of enjoying a film is to get inside and accept it, not pick it apart as you go.My main problem on first viewing was the Borg queen. As other commentators have pointed out, the Borg, even if they are referred to for brevity as a ""hive"" culture, are a collective, they are egalitarian democracy taken to an extreme. The term coined by Kurt Vonnegut in The Sirens of Titan - ""Hypnotic Anarchy"" - fits the Borg rather nicely, indeed I wonder if that may not have been the inspiration for them.But a collective does not have a queen. That worried me, until I remembered what happens when the queen ""dies"". All the flesh melts away, leaving a shiny metallic spine, that has red lights flickering inside and is evidently still alive, until broken, and the lights go out.Just as the Borg determined that it needed Locutus to be their spokesman, it seems also to have determined that humanoid species think in terms of leaders, individuals who hold the reins of state. So, like the Greek city states of old, they created one. The Borg queen, as can be seen in its moment of destruction, is a machine, a puppet. Far from holding the reins of state, it is controlled by the myriad strings of the collective.I would love know what arguments went on between the script writers, the director, and the producers, over this. Maybe this final scene was a compromise, that left both the dramatic value of the Borg queen and the integrity of the Borg concept intact.",Star Trek - First Contact

161,Steevh,Oh dear,3,28 April 1999,"Only 'Star Trek' could take a concept like this and make it so dull. When you have an invading force of cybernetic zombies attacking  a spaceship, you only have to imagine a combination of 'Aliens' and 'Night of the Living Dead' to see how good it could have been. Alas, no. The Cybermen (sorry, Borg) were reduced to ambling, aimless stooges with about as much menace as as they have originality. Meanwhile our cardboard crew were whittling away the running time getting involved in all manner of japes that failed to impress or excite any interest.Even a 'Hellraiser'ish Queen did nothing to distract from the crushing despair of just having paid another five quid to see a dead turkey plucked repetitively for two hours.To hell with it.

162,cal-brady,Trek On An Epic Scale,9,27 March 2010,"First Contact is essentially Star Trek on an epic scale. The Borg; who are always a difficult enemy for Starfleet to deal with, are back; with their usual intentions: to assimilate the human race.And of course, Captain Picard has been ordered not to engage the Borg at any time. But he does anyway (as I would do if I was caught in the same situation). Anyway, the Borg Cube launches a small sphere back in time (which the Enterprise, of course, chases into the vortex back in time). While this movie has caught the epic scale that would make it popular with a wide audience; I found that it lowered itself on the deeply personal scale. Not that it's a bad thing in itself; the movie is still really good; but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it did have more on the deeply personal scale.As it stands, this movie does not waste a single moment with filler. It's not a great deal more than an hour and a half long (maybe it is an hour forty-five, but fifteen minutes isn't that long, really); which is a good thing, because with the exception of JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek movie; Star Trek movies tend to get a bit too long once they hit the two hour mark.9/10",Star Trek - First Contact

Also sad is that none of the other series ever received a film.All that aside, this film is great as it is a very well rounded experience with some good acting performances and a well rounded plot that is both emotional and features some intense action sequences. Nothing feels forced and the set pieces do not come from a mile away.It is also worth noting that the sound track in this film is really great and especially the background music when the borg are on screen really hits the mark of perfection.It is just a shame they were not able to achieve this level of quality in terms of writing and directing on the following 2 next Generation films.",Star Trek - First Contact

Patrick Stewart, as Picard, gives what is easily his best performance in the Next Generation trio of films, and (don't laugh) could have snagged an Oscar nomination if Trek wasn't viewed as a ""cult"" franchise.  Certainly he does no worse than Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"" -- and Ms. Weaver snagged an Oscar nomination for that.",Star Trek - First Contact
166,jo007r,By far the greatest cinematic outing of any Star Trek film..,10,16 August 2000,"This is the movie that Star Trek should measure all of its standards by. There are wonderful characters in this film, the Borg Queen, Lily, and Cockrane, all of them exceed any other guest character in previous films. 
Once again Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart dominate the film with their acting, but that is fine all the same, Jonathan Frakes spends a lot of his time in the sun also, everyone does.  The plot once again involves time traveling, this time to stop the Borg from preventing the first warp flight of man kind.  Granted that anyone who watches this movie will be able to predict the victory of Picard and company over the Borg, but who could have ever thought of meeting the man who made warp speed possible, this is an excellent sub-plot in the movie. 
Just about every scene in this movie stands alone, and the viewers are treated with a brand new Enterprise.  From the first shot of the bridge you will be impressed.  The screenplay is the best out of all the other Star Treks, and it is wonderful seeing Picard make the transition from captain of the Enterprise to a self-destructive obsessive hunter, thirsty for revenge.  Kirk and company never looked this great!  The best dramatic scene is the one where Picard and Lily talk about abandoning the Enterprise and destroying it. Patrick Stewart shows not only viewers but critics that he truly is a gifted actor.  The scene is one of the movie's best, and will always be remembered amongst Trekkers.   With dazzling special effects, wonderful dialogue,an excellent score, an exciting plot, important messages and captivating action sequences.

167,jazaragoza,The Greatest Star Trek Film to date,10,12 July 2001,"Warning this review contains spoilersWow what can I say about this film.  This is the greatest Star Trek film to date, and the darkest.  From a great story to the greatest soundtrack for a Star Trek film.  Star Trek First Contact delivers.  The plot is that the crew of the Enterprise-E must go back in time and stop The Borg from changing Earth´s history for the worst.  The Borg want to prevent first contact and Zefram Cochrane´s first warp flight.  Picard and his crew must the living legend, after the Borg try to destroy Cochrane´s warp ship.  The Borg then try to assimilate the Enterprise, and Picard and his crew must battle them and the Borg Queen.This film contained excellent acting and great special effects.  The guest stars in this film give wonderful performances.  James Cromwell portrays a Zefram Cochrane that doesn´t want to be considered a historical figure.  He doesn´t consider himself great, unlike the Enterprise crew who worship him. He also brings humor to the story.  For example, he gets Counselor Troi drunk, which is a classic Trek moment.  Seeing Troi get drunk is worth the price of admission alone, and when Cochrane plays¨""Magic Carpet Ride"" right after lift off.  Alice Krige plays the Borg Queen to perfection.  The Borg Queen is ruthless as she is beautiful.  She is chilling as the Borg Queen.  She is considered to be one of the great Star Trek villains, she is the best villain since Khan in Star Trek II.  I loved the scene in which she seduced Data.  The Borg Queen is a memorable Star Trek villain.Alfre Woodard plays Lily Slone (Cochrane´s assistant) to perfection.  Lily is tough, but she is compassionate.  She is a character that won´t take what anyone dishes her.  I like the scene where she stood up to Picard and calls him Ahab.  This film can be viewed by non Star Trek fans, which is what makes it great. You don´t have to know the background of the characters or be familiar with the episodes to enjoy this film.  This film is a masterpiece of Science Fiction.  I advise you to pick this one up. I give this film an A+",Star Trek - First Contact
168,nolarobert,Resistance to enjoying this film is futile,10,11 May 2005,"Next to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, this is the best of the Trek films. For longtime fans of the Next Generation, this movie was the payoff for all those years of supporting the TV show. We get to see the Enterprise-E in some kick ass action sequences against the Borg. The time travel story actually works well and adds much to the Star Trek cannon. Patrick Stewart shines as the haunted Capt. Picard who must come to terms with the demons (Borg assimilation) from his past. His scene with Alfie Woodard where he makes the emotional statement, ""The line must be drawn HERE and no further,"" is one of the most memorable from the film franchise. As in the best of Trek, this movie mixes pathos, drama and humor with its humanity and positive message about mankind's future. Plenty of action keeps the story moving without the dreaded dead spots that some Trek films has suffered with in the past. Also, the Borg Queen was repulsive but yet so erotic that you had to admire Alice Krige for pulling off such an amazing feat. After all, no story really works without having a worthy antagonist.

Sure, there was action, but none of it was breath taking. The battle between Enterprise and Reliant in Star Trek 2 was far more exciting than anything here. Picard finally got a little physical in this movie, but he's no Kirk. In the next movie, Insurrection, Picard is supposed to be even more physical and disobedient than this one. Hmmmm...wonder why? Could it be because the writers are trying to make Picard more like Kirk? I definitely think so. Forget the next generation, bring back Kirk and company!

172,johnno-51370,The Zenith of Star Trek Films,10,21 August 2020,"Watching the riot that is Generations immediately followed by this, in my opinion the slickest Star Trek film, really gives you the sense that you're watching the absolute pinnacle of the ST franchise.The Borg return as the main agitators, and really come into their own as a horrifying enemy that fully deliver when it comes to threat and a sense of dread. They feel somehow even more parasitic than they do in TNG; perhaps because we get a different look at their process of assimilation or maybe because we're fully introduced to their queen.The film really nails it's portrayal of Earth in 2063; it feels like the future, but simultaneously feels like ""now"" in comparison to the usual Star Trek universe. James Cromwell is fantastic as Zephram Cochrane, and there's also a shining role for Data who battles some very human demons.This film also contains two of my all-time favourite Star Trek quotes. Firstly, Picard when explaining future economics to someone from the 21st century, says ""the acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. We work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity"". Secondly, when Picard accuses Worf of being a coward, the Klingon's perfectly-delivered response is simply ""if you were any other man I would kill you where you stand!"". You really believe that he could kill his captain in that very moment.Overall, I simply can't score this any less than 10/10.

Good screenplay good balance of CGI/Special Effects/ Drama. Good Directing, good acting. The sound and picture quality is just as good on DVD and Blue-ray as it was in the original theatres.

It was time to let the borg die long before this film, they were a one time villain and are very poor enemies.Lets go over the beginning, the flagship of the federation is no where near a battle with the borg (uh, ok) and decide to disobey orders and join the fighting. Picard takes command of the fleet after the convenient death of the admiral in charge.Worf is brought into the story by piloting the defiant (with no Sisko, Dax or other member of the senior staff with him, how much would it have cost to give them a cameo? again another uh, ok) The fleet destroys the borg ship. (remember when that used to be hard?) Which lauches a second spherical ship that goes back in time. Immediatly the earth changes to a borg infested planet.. the reason the Enterprise wasn't effected by the timeline changes was a ""temperal wake"" (oh, please) and they must save the future by going into the past.Of course, what results is a predictable story ""slaughter the borg, win the game"".

176,Donners,A very close second for Trek.,10,27 November 1999,"Star Trek is one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't type of shows. If the movies are made for Trekkies, then most of the general public won't watch, and Paramount will lose money. A good example of this is Generations. Massive implications if you are a Trek fan, but not important to anyone not familiar with the series. First Contact is slanted toward the general public, and thus many Trekkies claim that Paramount is selling out , and alienating true fans. I'm a Trekkie, but I still love this movie. The acting is great. Nobody ever complains about Patrick Stewart, and with good reason. He puts in a masterful, if overly emotional performance. The only member of the cast to annoy me is Martina Sirtis as Troi, but I have never liked the character. Thankfully, she recieves little air time. Alfre Woodard as Lily is excellent, and James Cromwell puts in a suitably drunken performance as Cochrane. The Queen [Alice Krige] is spooky and seductive enough, and of course the Borg drones are scary. It is interesting to hear Kelsey Grammar back on board the Bozeman, a nice little touch. Also, as always, links are made to other series with Ethan Phillips [Neelix in Voyager] appearing in the holodeck scene. There are rumours that Avery Brooks was supposed to be in it, but I'm not sure. A good cast all up. The special effects from Industrial Light and Magic are great, and did anyone else see that the nebula toward the start of the film looked like a giant cat? A great touch. There are so many memorable quotes and scenes from this film, but the one in Picard's Ready Room with Lily is one I will never forget. Perhaps a little too emotional, but one of the best Trek scenes of all time. The Borg are finally back to their terrifing best, something lacking in their last few episodes. There are few sci-fi villains that are better. The plot is average, but the film is so fast that you don't have time to care. Many people are incensed that this Cochrane is so different to the one in TOS, but I missed that era, so I'm neutral. Overall, a great movie, but still falls behind Star Trek VI.",Star Trek - First Contact

178,MovieFan095,My Favorite Movie of All Time,10,17 December 2019,"Star Trek is a franchise that I have always been a fan of, and I find this film to be the Star Trek film that I watched the most. That's why I feel like this is my favorite movie of all time.It is the twenty-fourth century, and the Borg (cybernetic lifeforms) have spread across the galaxy with one sole purpose: to assimilate and conquer all races. Under the command of their seductive and sadistic Queen, the Borg are headed to Earth with a devious plan involving time travel to alter history. After an epic battle against the Borg, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-E crew follow the Borg sphere back into the twenty-first century, and must battle the Borg Queen before she assimilates mankind. Meanwhile, Picard and his crew must make sure that Zefram Cochrane makes his famous warp flight, and makes Earth's first contact with an alien species (the Vulcans).Wow, This movie is incredible. It has an excellent storyline. All the actors did a perfect job in this movie. The action in Top-Notch.My two favorite scenes in these movies are the scenes where Robert Picardo and Ethan Phillips make cameos in this movie, and they both did an incredible job in those scenes.All in all, Star Trek: First Contact is my favorite movie of all time.

180,DerekTheCritic,Remarkably Good Movie - not JUST for Trek fans!,9,17 May 2013,"My wife and I watched the last 40 minutes of this movie on TV last night. She works for a production company that worked on ""Into Darkness,"" and she had never seen any of the older Star Trek movies. I had seen ""First Contact"" when it came out in theaters, and I remembered that I really enjoyed it. At first I figured, ""Well, I was a kid, and everything that involved space ships and lasers and explosions was cool back then."" Boy, was I wrong.""First Contact"" is not simply a sci-fi movie. In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot.I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks: you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching.I highly recommend this movie. I'll go so far as to say I think it's better than ""Wrath of Khan."" Yeah, I said it!",Star Trek - First Contact

Picard is dealing with his white whale (the Borg), and Data has to choose whether or not to take that extra step in his life long quest to become more human.Despite being about these two iconic characters and their struggles, its also a thrill ride as the crew fights to save the timeline and prevent the Borg apocalypse. I watched this as a
I watched this as a kid and seeing the Borg in their big screen makeup as they assimilate the new Enterprise is still awesome 25 years later. A must see for any Star Trek fan, but is exciting even if you aren't a fan as new viewers can journey through Lilly eyes.Only thing I've never been sold on is the Queen but it is what it is and might not have been as thrilling without her. Also from a writing perspective it gave Data and Picard a foil that if nothing else helped their character arcs, so I forgive her.Still my favorite ST movie ever!",Star Trek - First Contact

The story is a little similar to ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" in that the Enterprise must go back in time to stop a borg threat which is carried out brilliantly.

186,Imrahil,Good--not great.,7,4 December 1998,"While infinitely better than its predecessor, this movie has several major flaws in it that keep it from being what many consider to be the 'best of the series'. First, the lack of internal consistency...Zephram Cochrane was established to be from Alpha Centauri in the first seriers...how the hell does he get from Earth to there, much less being KNOWN as Zephram Cochrane OF Alpha Centauri?  Secondly, and more important, the character of Lily seems ridiculous, especially with regards to her relationship with Picard.  We are to assume that this Starship Captain has lost all emotional stability and reasoning, but a woman he hardly knows (not his crew at all) is the one who brings it back to him?However, the Borg Queen more than makes up for this, giving a chillingly disturbing and at the same time vaguely erotic performance in her role.The last thing, though, that I find annoying...how many ways can they find to get Worf back among the crew? He's gone to DS9...let him stay there...",Star Trek - First Contact
187,rockgoddess,Love the Borg Queen,10,27 June 2003,"First Contact is the best Star Trek I've seen in years.  I would like to point out that I began to take an interest in Star Trek after this film. The star of this film, in my opinion, is The Borg Queen.  Few Star Trek films are able to craft a villain who can really hold your interest. The Borg seemed rather boring until her first screen appearance. The crew was at their best in this movie as well. Picard was amazing as he added a touch of drama to the action. A wonderful mix of Drama, comedy and action.",Star Trek - First Contact
188,b_stavisky,Star Trek at its best.,10,24 October 2000,"Star Trek First Contact is one of the best films in the Star Trek series and the best for the Next Generation cast.  The beauty of this film is that it takes elements from the original series and expands upon it while paying homage to its roots in the USS Enterprise NCC-1701E which resembles in many ways the Enterprise in Star Trek The Motion Picture.  There is wonderful character development here and all the cast has their moments in the film. You actually identify and feel with the charcters as they wage this battle against time and the borg. Picard struggling with Locutus, his wanting revenge made Picard more real than he has been. The borg queen trying to seduce Data gave him some depth also. It think Worf said it all with ""Asimilate this!"" From start to finish this movie shows what Star Trek really is that the ""human"" adventure is just beginning.",Star Trek - First Contact
189,azalard,Pretty decent sequel,8,21 February 2003,"By itself, Star Trek First Contact wasn't fantastic, but it's probably one of the better films out of the series.  It was the first Star Trek film to include all of the Next Generation cast and none from the original series. Overall, I enjoyed this one.  There were a couple scenes where I was left wanting to see more.  For example, I think the ending was rushed.  I would have also liked to have seen a longer battle sequence in the beginning between the Borg and Starfleet. Either way, I recommend this film to everybody.",Star Trek - First Contact
190,gunflyer,Overrated by a great margin,5,3 June 2011,"Star Trek: First Contact is beloved by all kinds of fans... this blows my mind. Here's what bothers me: They turned Picard into a gun-toting psycho who kills his own crew who are turning into the Borg when even he was saved from the Borg. He's not the enlightened captain we know from the series.Another big problem is nothing makes sense. The Borg go back in time huh? Well why didn't they do that before? What's to stop them from doing it again? Why didn't they go back in time even further? The Borg Queen was a HUGE mistake. She is an antagonist who completely undermines the image and the menace behind the Borg. All the sex stuff between her and Data was just completely wrong and it makes me sick to my stomach to think about this. Why did they have to add so many disgusting sexual innuendos to this movie?! Yes, I'm asking YOU, people who condemn the Transformers movies for having innuendos that are subtle by comparison. I mean You do NOT say ""Was it good for you too?"" In a STAR TREK MOVIE!!! You do not have somebody say ""That is because you haven't been properly stimulated(sexually)"". That is wrong! It's disgusting! The Holodeck scene makes no sense(I guess Borg can't adapt to Machine gun fire now?!) Then Picard And Lily wander pointlessly about the ship for a long time, and Picard and all the crew violate the temporal prime directive by telling Cochrane and Lily everything about the future! The characters are wasted. Riker, Worf, Geordi, Crusher are simply along either for the ride or to provide the lamest possible comic relief in the history of sci-fi. They don't even have much of a dramatic purpose! That's another thing... Why did they get Troi drunk? Was THAT supposed to be funny? That's not funny, that's a parody of Star Trek! That's farce! I understand light-hearted humor, that's what The Voyage Home did so well, without overdoing it. This movie, and frankly all the Next Gen movies overdid it on the ""humor"", and I use that term VERY loosely.Oh, and the action movie line, Worf actually says ""Assimilate this!"" and blows up the deflector dish. Okay, that may be okay for a Die Hard movie, but NOT for a Star Trek film! Stupid action movie clichés like dumb ass one-liners have NO business in a Star Trek movie! And here's the kicker... Data fires torpedoes at the Phoenix ship, WHY?! The Phoenix ship will go to warp and the Ahem ""Aliens"" will pick up their presence and that will cause First contact. Why did Data shoot at the Phoenix? The Phoenix could have been destroyed, easily. I don't care if Data has precision aiming, he still cannot account for all kinds of unforeseen variables! It's kind of sad, because First Contact had potential. Seriously, First contact is boring, it's not big enough for a movie. It's nowhere near as good as the Best of both worlds episodes. The characters are either wasted or completely violated. For more details, please consult the Youtube reviews from the likes of Red Letter Media and Confused Matthew.",Star Trek - First Contact

192,jonathanfisk,Star Trek shows us the pro's and con's of Communism!,9,25 July 2016,"While Star Trek on television doesn't necessarily need a fantastic villain to keep the viewer enthralled, it seems that the series will be at its best on the silver screen if it does. Khan had been undoubtedly the greatest villain that Trek had seen up to this point, but the Borg arguably rivals the old 20th century super- genius for that title. And in comparison to Khan, who was made into a great character because of the performance of Ricardo Montalban, the Borg is a merciless villain with an intriguing take on society attempting to achieve perfect unity. It may be The Next Generation's greatest contribution to the franchise, so it was the right choice for this crew's first film without the original crew.Of course, Star Trek needs to not just have great villains and action in order to appease the fans. It also needs to make us think. This is where the Borg succeeds. They/It is a collective, a group of individuals fused into one mind, doing whatever is necessary for the progress of the Borg. It sounds like Communism at its most efficient: no free will, but everyone is working for the greater good. Obviously, this is a taboo concept in American thinking, so it is interesting to also hear Picard discuss with the 21st century stowaway, Lily, how the Earth did away with money and became focused on doing everything for the betterment of the world. That's Communist thinking too, isn't it? It just sounds much less sinister this time. But I digressWhile the Borg itself is great in this film, it was the right choice to give the collective a mouthpiece with the Borg queen, leading to interesting scenes between her and our emotional android, Data. But there is another plot line in this film which is given so much screen time that it really is not a subplot: that being Riker & Co's quest to ensure the historical moment of First Contact with alien life is not thwarted by the Borg. This story is not as engrossing as the Borg, but James Cromwell's acting as warp-speed man Zefram Cochran keeps it entertaining. It's hard not to think during the movie that Riker, Troi, and Geordi are extremely lucky to not be up on the Enterprise dealing with the Borg though.First Contact uses much of the same elements that made the previous quality Star Trek films (2, 4, & 6) enjoyable. A strong and ruthless villain, intriguing concepts about the progress of society and cooperation, literary allusions (Captain Ahab, again!), and even time travel. I appreciated the simplified take on time travel in this film, however, compared to The Voyage Home. It's probably best to not spend time explaining something that is implausible, so just go with it like it's an easy thing. The high points in this come with seeing the Next Generation crew members have their own moments to show that they can hold their own in a Star Trek film, especially Capt. Picard and Worf. This is such an exciting film with strong acting that I wonder if it is even better than Wrath of Khan, making it the best Trek film, but I'm not sure I'm ready to make such a bold statement after some considerations below.Some final thoughts: It makes sense that Vulcans would be the first alien life to make contact with humans on Earth, but why would they be speaking English?! I would think being above radioactive gas would still be lethal, but apparently it takes more of a ""hot lava"" approach. Data and the Borg Queen discussing sexual pleasure is a little gag worthy, though it is interesting that even cyborgs know this is how you get a man to do what you want. While it is realistic and probably a correct prediction, it's depressing to think that humans will only achieve unity and begin looking to the stars after we have decimated each other in World War III. Ugh*My film rating follows the soccer player rating measure of 6 as a baseline: you did what was expected of you. This film is a 9 because First Contact keeps the viewer on the edge of the seat for any scene involving the Borg. The plot involving Zefram Cochran's forced quest to achieve warp speed might be unnecessary, but still makes for an intriguing look into how humanity changed for the better.",Star Trek - First Contact

195,acenturia,A Great Contribution to Next Generation's Set.,7,3 April 2015,"While I give this a review of seven, in plain words that means 'good'.As a contribution to theatre, the crew of Next Generation is continuingly pleasing. As a contribution to Film and Sci-Fi in total, alright. Some parts were annoying. Such as when Data quickly generated a fractal encryption that the Borg cannot break to protect the computer, and which becomes a rather pivotal concept to the latter events that add plot twist to the film. I find it rather difficult to believe that the collective power of the friggin Borg cannot compute the solution to a problem a single android generates in under five seconds, regardless if it's Data. Why fractals? Do the Borg not understand how fractals act so that their hopeless? Not likely I say, and so poorly written. That in addition to when enterprise goes back in time. Ill admit, the play does have some unexpectedness which was well done. There was something missing though, that I cannot quite put a finger on. Maybe someone else will do better.The movie was a satisfying watch or someone who really just finished watching all 7 seasons of Next Generation, again. I feel just fine with the casting, and it was cool seeing Enterprise-E. The film does not add such great moments to film that I would consider it one of my favourites, and while Star Trek sure is Sci-Fi, I find it difficult for me to add it to what one call 'classic'.

196,Calis,Best Of Both Worlds Part 3,8,3 January 1999,"Ok, first off I think we can disregard ""I,Borg"" and ""Descent"",  First Contact is the sequel to ""Best Of Both Worlds"". As Jonathan Frakes major movie directorial debut he did a fantastic job, the people to blame for this movies flaws are the producers who will insist on continually writing the stories, I think it's time for some fresh blood.  This movie is visually pleasing and I was blown away the first time I saw it, but every time I have tried to watch it at home it continually puts me to sleep. I was disappointed to see that Dennis McCarthy didn't score the film after the fantastic job he did on Generations, this isn't to say I didn't like the soundtrack for First Contact I just think Generations is better. I was also a bit disappointed to see the rest of the crew not including Picard, Data or Wolf being relegated to comic relief, again this a reflection on the writers not the director. I would like to see Jonathan Frakes direct the next few ST films with new writers and a bit less control given to the producers, after all this isn't television.

197,Jazzman-17,"The Best of the Films, and the most in spirit of the Series",9,26 June 1999,"Star Trek has always been about Ideas.  I have seen people bash the movies and the episodes without even having seen one.  Many people also seem to focus on the scientific absurdities of Star Trek.  They bash everything about this movie regarding time travel.These people miss the point. (What Sci Fi movie other than 2001 makes complete sense anyways?)Star Trek has always been about ideas.  Gene Roddenberry always spoke of star trek as, ""A show that uses the medium of the future to speak about the present""  This movie has remained true to Gene's vision and has created a tense and thrilling movie in the process.Even though I am a trekker my review is not biased as I deplored Star Trek I and V (and I wasn't overly keen on generations either)The borg have returned and have decided to travel backwards in time to wipe out humanity just before it was capable of meeting another intelligent species.  Picard though, driven by his duty, and his underlying hatred of the borg(he was once assimilated into their collective mind), travels back with them in order to prevent this from happening.The movie has a wonderful visual feel.  The Borg are dark and hideous. Lights are dimmed and the entire film seems mechanized in some way.  The opening shot is magnificent where the camera pulls out of picards eyeball to an entire gleaming bor collective.  Frakes certainly got the feel of the movie down.Usually when a star trek movie becomes bad is when it tries to appeal to a broad range audience by inserting one liners.  This movie remembers the foundation that Star Trek is built on.  Ideas.  Every star trek movie has a human theme involved.  Picard is driven to stop the borg in order to protect humanity. But his vision becomes clouded by his intense hatred of the borg. He begins to revel in killing them (holodeck scene).  This is one of the human themes in the movie.  What is the line between objectivity and hatred? Stewart does an excellent job of handling the role.The borg are masterful villians.  They are relentless and keep on coming. ALice Kirge gives Data a class in seduction.With the advent of Deep Space 9, I was fearing the movies would begin to go awry but this movie has wavered my doubts.Now if we only had a movie with Q...",Star Trek - First Contact
198,revpetebrazier,Best of the Star Treks,8,28 November 2015,"This is by far the best of the Star trek Movies. Though Wrath of Khan beats it perhaps in the swagger and style department (or soundtrack and cinematography), this film out performs the rest in a number of departments.Firstly it is good, proper sci-fi; it asks many what ifs about the nature of humanity in the Data/Borg Queen interactions and about how as humans we respond to oppression and invasion; not just of territory but also of culture and history. It also asks classic trek questions about the nature of our place in the universe.First Contact joins up a number of themes for the Trek-savvy audience, but is still a good film on its own without needing to understand the references - that's a tough rope for the writers to walk.There are great performances from characters specific to the film, like Alfre Woodard (Lily), James Cromwell (Zefram Cochran) and Alice Krige (Borg Queen). There are also some of the best Patrick Stewart (Picard) moments and a performance from Brent Spiner (Data) that lifts both actor and character far above what we have seen from him before. Perhaps the only downside of this film is that some of the really good performances do highlight the slightly limited range of Sirtis (Troi) and Frakes (Riker), who are fine, but not great.Overall, First Contact works so well because the good writing, performances and philosophical questions are bound up in a compelling story that balances high drama, humour and human interest.",Star Trek - First Contact

WHAT? That added a whole new element to the Borg. in addition to characters from their history who were completely sidelined by everything going on...the complexity made for amazing intrigue. Of course, my heros are all there from the ship but Alfre Woodard positioned herself as almost a crew member who stood her ground when needed.

The beginning of the film, though stylish, played down the new ship and the build-up to the invasion was hurried.

205,revelation59,Can Our Future Be Altered/First Contact,9,16 September 2006,"I found this movie appealing in several ways. The main one that comes to my mind is the subject of our futures and whether they are written in stone. The Enterprise travellled back in time through a wormhole to attempt to stop the Borg from destroying their present existence. I think of my study in the Bible Book of Ezekiel and how the human effort of the peoples of Tyre (now situated off the coast of Lebanon) had reversed the prophecy which Ezekiel had made about King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroying them in war around 586 BC. The prophecy was reversed temporarily as Ezekiel notes. This was because their determined effort for seven years had caused the Babylonians to quit and retreat. Later God caused Alexander the Great to finish them off. But even the prophesied future of peoples can be altered at times by determined human effort. It was also interesting to see humanities and technology (not science) together. Some science people aren't very cultured people in real life. I was in science until the profession or the government started violating my human rights. Then I did not even look at a sci-fi movie for years! Star Trek movies and TV shows, especially the ones with William Shatner are more intelligently written that Star Wars movies. I had watched a rerun of a Star Wars movie on TV with them firing all those photon torpedoes and all I could think of was a corny 80's video game! Star Trek used to have some heavy philosophical and moral issuezx in them. Yet I am not a science geek. I have been out in the world and have had my education in the school of life as well.

211,paul-888-783284,A solid entry in the Star Trek saga (minor references to characters),10,5 January 2014,"Star Trek has often fallen short of Star Wars in the region of movie magic. Even the strongest entries in the franchise, such as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, have been criticized for lackluster special effects and somewhat shoddy animation. The eighth entry, however, breaks with tradition by delivering a polished, professional look combined with a story that, though teetering at times, still manages to convey the classic Star Trek message of hope and understanding.The film has suffered a hit in popularity recently due to some well- renowned reviews, courtesy of RedLetterMedia. While I personally tended to agree with his assessment, watching the movie made me reevaluate some of RLM's criticisms as unfounded or misleading. The story isn't flawless, by no accounts so, but it's most certainly watertight, and it brings the point across very well.Choosing Jonathan Frakes as a director was a wise move. Not only was he efficient in bringing home a good production (allegedly earning the nickname ""Two-Takes Frakes"" on set), but his long experience of Star Trek as a cast member on The Next Generation enabled him to produce a film that would go on to please hardcore trekkers and film critics alike. He, alongside fellow Enterprise crew members and guest stars, also do a good job of portraying the various culture clashes as the Enterprise is stranded in the past, its complement feverishly working to save humanity from its direst perils yet.The score, by Jerry and Joel Goldsmith, doesn't disappoint either. It combines the harrowing tune of the Borg with the lighter, cheerful leitmotif of the Enterprise. No complaints there.Overall, the movie probably deserve 8.5-9/10, but I rate it higher to bring the average up to where it belongs.",Star Trek - First Contact
212,qssmith,This was a GREAT movie,9,9 January 1999,"I'm not sure why everyone here seems to hate this movie. Every complaint seems to be nerdy Trekky babble. I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I do like the Next Generation. I didn't care too much for Generations, but this one was excellent. Insurrection wasn't too bad either. First Contact had a great story and Frakes did an excellent job of directing. I'm also very happy Jerry Goldsmith was brought in to score this movie along with Insurrection. McCarthy's score to Generations was very boring. His work was fine for the show, but it doesn't really work in a movie.If you want to see an excellent movie, see First Contact. In my opinion, the best of the Star Trek series.",Star Trek - First Contact
213,AbeJnkns,"Not a bad movie, but it's not TREK.",1,7 December 1998,"I can enjoy virtually any movie.  All it takes is being in the right frame of mind.  Unfortunately, I went into this movie expecting a Star Trek movie, not ""Aliens"" with the TNG crew. From the beginning, Star Trek: The Next Generation, took the ideals of the original series (a future where mankind is more or less at peace, where our main focus is exploration and learning rather than war) to a new level. This movie, though, embraces the classic science fiction future, where mankind is always struggling to survive in a war.  In THIS case, the war is against a ruthless enemy who has determined that by going back in time to destroy Earth, it can win its war.That's not a bad concept, and in fact, if someone had just told me the plot, I'd've run to see this movie.  HOWEVER, I came to see this movie because  it was Star Trek, and if I hadn't gotten my tickets for free (and therefore, my protests were virtually meaningless), I'd've walked out of the theater.",Star Trek - First Contact

215,squarefanatic,Magical Sci-Fi experience,10,24 February 2004,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best Trek films made. Words cannot do it justice - not only is the script very strong and creative, but the supporting cast meshes with their roles perfectly. The classic ideals set forth by the Star Trek franchise are present here, and as hard to ignore as ever. A future as bright and broad as this one is an amazing thing to behold - and the old TNG crew does a great job of presenting it to us. The theme of the movie, man's first substantial ventures into space, is well selected and a very moving step out of the ashes that would be, in the Star Trek world, world war III. In any case, put your prejudices against Star Trek aside and go rent this one, you'll be amazed.",Star Trek - First Contact

The plot is not exactly new (go back in time to save the present) but the story is a good one.  Its action-packed, plenty of Star Trek type humor.  Its one of my absolute favorites. Patrick Stewert and the rest of the usual Cast do an excellent job in their roles.  Hidden humor is there for the fans, and plenty of action (and some humorous moments) are there for the 'rest'.  The special effects are up to their usual high standards.In short.  If you are a fan, you will not want to miss this one.  If you just like fairly serious (not tongue-in-cheek) sci-fi, you will probably enjoy this one as well.  If you don't care for the futuristic, well...",Star Trek - First Contact
217,DaveInTheCave,Average Trek,8,14 April 2012,"I wanted to like this Trek more than I actually did. It has the emotion and character interaction I love to see from Star Trek, but it seems dumbed down from a Sci-fi standpoint compared to the TV show. There are convenient plot contrivances that we are supposed to take for granted. Like when Picard knows exactly where to hit the Borg ship in the opening battle scene. The Borg, once a unique race, all united as one one collective, are given a queen in this movie, reducing them to the equivalent of an ant colony. Picard, usually such a calm, collected, concerned officer, is a revenge driven action hero type this time around. Also while the parts on the ship were fairly well done, in that they had tension, the scenes with Cochrane and the rest of the crew feel very awkward at times. The idea of time travel (once again) is taken far to lightly in comparison with the TV series. I also found it rushed at times. Despite all this I don't hate the film. It had some enjoyable character moments and was well acted for the most part. The ""action"" scenes with the Borg are appropriately eerie and suspenseful. It also boasts a superb score from the late, great Jerry Goldsmith. It's a half decent action movie but Trek works best when it has headier concepts to work with.",Star Trek - First Contact
218,adam-martin8023,A pinnacle of Science Fiction movies of the 1990's,10,12 July 2006,"Being a science fiction and action fan, I decided to rent this movie. I never considered myself a Trekkie but seeing a few episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation, the riveting Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country and the somewhat decent Star Trek Nemesis, I wanted to give this a try. I never regretted my decision.The movie is about Captain Piccard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew of the spaceship the USS Enterprise E trying to repel an Earthbound invasion from the Borg. (An alien race of half-organic and machine living beings) Just as the Borg's flagship is being destroyed, the aliens launch a sphere toward Earth which causes a time warp. The Enterprise follows the Borg time travel device through the time warp (in which Picard and his crew, catch a glimpse of Earth being transformed by the Borg)and they both end up going from the 24th century to the mid 21st.Captain Piccard realizes that the Borg are trying to alter Earth's history by disrupting an event known as ""First Contact"". (The day in which a race of aliens called the Vulcans discover Earth and help the human race into a renaissance which leads to the colonization and exploration of space.) The Enterprise destroys the Borg vessel and the crew beam down to an area in Montana in which they are looking for the first-man who would travel the speed of light known as Cochran(James Cromwell).However, the Borg's have somehow teleported onto the Enterprise and are starting to modify to it. They kidnap crew members and transform them into Borgs. With Piccard, Worf, Data, and Crusher (Stewart, Michael Dorn, Brent Spiner, Gates McFadden) on board along with a woman named Lilly from the 21st century(Alfre Woodard) they must attempt to retake the Enterprise. Meanwhile back on Earth, Geordi, Deanna, and Riker(Levar Burton, Marina Sirtis, and Jonathan Frakes) must help a boozed up Cochrane for his history making event that leads the human race to peace.The movie is well made, well written, and well directed. The special effects are still impressive over a decade later. The actors give out great performances and the Borg's makeup effects are spectacular. There is action, suspense, musical scores by Jerry Goldsmith (One of the greatest composers of all time), humor, and inner conflict.As a non-Trekkie, I recommend this movie to science fiction fans, and Star Trek The Next Generation fans. You won't regret seeing this! 9 out of 10.",Star Trek - First Contact

220,fairygal,not the best star trek ever...but good,8,10 December 2005,"as a star trek fan i have to say that the next generation movies aren't the greatest in general - the originals were much better. kudos to the Rick Berman for still being able to come up with an idea for yet another film though and this is a fantastic story line for both experienced and unexperienced trekkers. whilst for the unexperienced trekker can enjoy the what the film says about the human race and the choices/actions that shape our world the experienced trekker can revel in the history being given to all the films and series we've already had. picards relationship with the Borg is interesting and put across well, especially in the initial sequence however one gets a little tired of his attitude towards the end of the film. whilst generations remains the all time best next generation film (ruined only by the lack of Leonard nimoy) first contact steams ahead of its following film insurrection in the sense of the action and the fantastic impression of the bond between the crew and their captain, and the captain and his ship. watch out for the moby dick quotes.",Star Trek - First Contact

James Cromwell comes across extremely well, especially with the attitude that he is just a man trying to get rich. He adds a funny touch from blasting his music to getting Deanna drunk. The Borg was always such a scary and how do we beat these guys enemy. Alice performs a superb acting job and I rank this up there with # 2, 4 and 6.",Star Trek - First Contact
222,Captain Kite,good action movie - not a good Next Gen movie,5,2 November 2002,"Let's face it: Picard's generation aren't made for the action-smash movie set. They don't fit with it. Kirk and company were made for brash brawling and gunning down Khan and the Klingons, which made for great movies that were true to the original series; Picard's series dwelt on the more cerebral affairs of diplomacy, temporal paradoxes and altered realities. The higher-concept stuff of Star Trek: The Next Generation doesn't feel right squished into a movie setting, where flashy explosions and high energy levels are expected. ""First Contact"" is a good action/sci-fi flick - but it takes one of TNG's better sci-fi concepts and trashes it in the name of marketability.Yes, ""First Contact"" has great action sequences - the zero-g fight, the weird radioactive gas thing in the end, even the delightfully kitchy holodek mobster fight. The plot on earth works wonders simply because of James Cromwell's portrayal of Zephram Cochrane - his character and his story are compelling. And Picard's ""Ahab Syndrome"" was pretty sweet too.The problem in this movie is the Borg - and more specifically, with the introduction of a ""Borg Queen."" The reason why the Borg are so frightening in the Next Generation TV series was not merely because they were powerful, but because they were so incredibly alien: they were a race in which no individuals exist. The Borg are not a ""hive of drones"" who are ruled by a ""queen""; they are a single mind spread throughout billions upon billions of bodies. A single Borg is not akin to a drone in a hive, which has an individual nature but which is oppressed in a rigid hierarchy; rather, it is akin to a cell in an organism - it has no free, meaningful, or distinct existence beyond the larger body. There is no head or ""ruler"" of the Borg, any more than there is a single cell in your body that governs what you do. What makes the Borg's outlook on the rest of the universe so disturbing is that they cannot comprehend individuality, and thus individual lives are utterly insignificant to them... they take life without compunction because to the Borg, they aren't really taking lives - killing a human is like scraping a cell off someone's skin, an inconsequential act. The Borg are a truly alien species with a completely alien mindset - a rare gem in mainstream sci-fi.But ""First Contact"" gives them a Queen who struts around and acts for all the world like a nasty human in some expensive makeup. She exchanges quips with Picard. She drips sexual innuendo over Data. She acts more like a James Bond temptress than a member of an alien cybernetic overmind. It completely demystifies them, makes them more human, when what made them so compelling is that they are so completely inhuman.Without the Borg Queen, this movie would have perhaps been less approachable to casual moviegoers - after all, most expect their villains to have a face they can react to, and the Borg are nothing if not faceless - but it would have kept the Borg at their chilling and pure best. Instead, ""First Contact"" waters down Next Generation's brilliance and replaces it with some smirking one-liners and a lot of stuff that gets blown up.6/10",Star Trek - First Contact
223,Jo_the_film_junkie,Stands out as a good science fiction film even on its own,9,22 May 2007,"One of the problems of the Star Trek franchise, especially in the more recent installments, Insurrection and Nemesis, has been pushing the envelope of both Science Fiction and the Star Trek universe, boldly going where no one has gone before. That was easy for the first series and some of the films made with the original cast, but in terms of CGI and storytelling there was no new ground to break for Star Trek, others had gone there before. This explains why especially Star Trek IX and X seem so weak. First Contact is/was different. It is the best film made with the cast of The Next Generation without any challenge, and is right up there with my other two favourites, Wrath of Khan and The Undiscovered Country. It opens with a huge battle of Star Fleet against a Borg ship, which is one of the best set piece battle sequences of the whole franchise (along with the battles of DS9 against Klingon and Jem Hadar fleets) even though it is a bit short. immediately after the battle the film reprises the idea of time travel that was already used in the Voyage Home. This time however the reason is a far call from the cringeworthy whale-saving mission of Star Trek IV, it is about preventing the Borg from foiling Cochrane's first warp flight, which in turn would mean that the First Contact with the Vulcans and the founding of the Federation would never take place. Now the crew must ensure that history or rather the future takes its course, while ridding the Enterprise from Borg infestation. what makes this film stronger than the other installments with the TNG crew is that they are firmly grounded in the known Star Trek universe, featuring a known villain race, the Borg which are anyway one of the most imaginative creations of Star Trek, and a key event in Federation history, First Contact. Insurrection and Nemesis on the other hand just introduced new evil races, the Son'a and the Remans, sticking them onto the universe without much background. the Borg in First Contact are a known quantity but their background is expanded by introducing the Borg Queen. the film also explores human nature. the fact that the film leaves the utopian vision of a world without war, hunger and poverty and travels to an Earth devastated by World War III with 600 million dead, is a strong reminder of humanity's violent and destructive character, that we are made painfully aware of in each day's news bulletin. Picard himself also is unlike we have seen him before, thirsting for revenge from the Borg who once assimilated him. The Borg Queen in her role as a manipulating temptress is ironically the one who instead of assimilating Data brings him closer to to feeling human than he bargained for. And there is the most likable character of the whole film, punch-drunk anti-hero and Rock'n'Roll-fan Zefram Cochrane, who is very uncomfortable with all his future fame and hero-status that the timetravellers confront him with. maybe one of the morals of the film here is to always take history as it is written with a pinch of salt. however, it remains a bit of a mystery how an alcoholic such as him could fashion a warp ship. the film has some truly memorable scenes such as the zero-G fight at the deflector dish with the Enterprise shown upside down, or Picard moving down Borg in with holographic bullets in a 1920s holodeck setting. among these remaining impressions are also the film's irony in such moments as that showing a more-drunk-than-tipsy Deanna Troi ""just trying to bl-lend in"", as well as the unavoidable cheesy lines - ""Borg? Sounds Swedish"" and ""Try to assimilate that"". not only in comparison to other Star Trek movies, but even on its own, First Contact stands out as a good Science Fiction film, and is more than the sum of prosthetics and CGI, showing some good writing, directing and acting. It is the only Star Trek film I ever watched in a cinema and it was worth it. When I saw the trailer on TV I just had to see. Resistance was futile. The Star Trek films after that just did not have that allure.",Star Trek - First Contact

The comraderie that was shown between the cast members was something that was a great part of the movie.

Showing Picard's drive for revenge was really something and bringing back the Borg is something that we've all wanted for a long time. Alice Krige, Alfre Woodard, and James Cromwell were all great additions to the cast for this movie and the regular cast performed superbly. A definate 8.5/10 for me. I think this movie ranks among the best Trek movies and is only surpassed by Star Treks 2 and 6. Resistance is Futile.",Star Trek - First Contact
227,whiteroses100,Moby Dick,10,24 March 2000,This would have to be the best of all the films that have been made (by far).

228,dsmith-12,Picard at his finest!,10,25 May 2000,"After watching the highest moment in all of four Star Trek series, ""The Best of Both Worlds"" two-parter, I wondered how being assimilated by the borg would affect Picard's judgment, his personality and his command ability. First Contact tells that story extremely well.  We finally see a Jean-Luc Picard that is different from the dry fuddy-duddy we've known.  Armed with an understanding of the Borg and an ability to hear their thoughts, Picard is driven to stop his ship and his planet from being assimilated at all costs.  As the Borg take over the new Enterprise, his mission to stop them from interrupting humanity's first contact with alien life slowly becomes a personal vendetta, to avenge the assimilation of his crew, countless civilizations and most of all, himself.  Helping him keep his wits intact is a fine performance from Alfre Woodard as Lily, who's one of the few actresses that can match Patrick Stewart in acting ability.  Also excellent was Michael Dorn as Worf.  We got to see the newer, in charge, red shirt Worf that had evolved into a command presence on ""Deep Space 9"".  He too was the only one that could stand up to a captain on the edge of insanity.  To lighten up the film, were two other story arcs, the Borg Queen seducing Data to retrieve codes to access the computer and Riker and crew fixing the Phoenix with help of Zephram Cochrane.  Cochrane played by James Cromwell, is how I imagine great icons of our history like Lewis & Clark or Thomas Jefferson.  His motivation for this historic event is money.  He feels like no hero.  This film is one of my favorite sci-fi films and the second best Trek film (Wrath of Khan still on top!)  I hope for Star Trek 10, they can pull of the magic of this one.",Star Trek - First Contact
229,Bones-47,Plot holes abound.,5,25 August 2000,"Contains spoilers.As with so many other instalments of Trek this film had a lot of potential. As usual the potential is not realised. Apart from the uneasy mix of horror and humour (the relatively good Borg scenes followed by the awful stuff down at Cochrane's village) there are an abundance of plot holes.Unfortunately we get time travel again. This time the Borg can do it. If they possess this technology then surely they would have assimilated every planet in the galaxy already. Why travel all the way to Earth (in a single cube again) fight a battle, lose and then go back in time? Why not go back in time and then travel to Earth thus meeting no resistance on the way?Picard joins the battle after many ships are destroyed. Once on scene he tells the other ships where to fire at the cube. Surely he should have told Starfleet this vital information several years previously.How does Cochrane, almost single handedly, build a revolutionary new Starship in an old missile silo?Why are the Borg so dumb? They just let the humans walk around unmolested half the time as long as the humans don't act threateningly. I could understand this behaviour when they first encountered humans but surely they should have learned by now. They hardly even try to stop Worf and Picard from detaching the deflector dish.At the end of the film Data says he's able to recreate the manner in which the Borg time travel and the Enterprise returns to it's own time. This means that they can now time travel, at will, with little effort. Presumably they later pass this good news on to the rest of Starfleet.This film could have been so much better if they'd dispensed with the Time Travel and kept it gritty and realistic (for Trek anyway). BTW was anyone else underwhelmed by the opening credits music?",Star Trek - First Contact
230,Indyanna,The best of the three Picard films,8,29 October 2002,"Star Trek is one of my childhood lovables, and Captain Picard and his crew are the best of all! Star Trek: First Contact is the best of the, so far, series of three films with Patrick Stewart and Co. The story is exactly what Star Trek is all about! The Borg Queen is fantastic and James Cromwell has been given a role not so usual for him, which I appreciate a lot, he is excellent! I like him more as the brilliant drunkard Dr. Zachram Cochrane than as one of the many Army guys he plays. However, I have found two little flaws which do strike a Trekkie like me, and which maybe somebody will care to explain: first, the Borg are still partly organic aren't they? How come they can breathe in outer space (the scene on the hull)? I don't believe they can... Then, at the beginning one guy says the Borg control decks 28 to 11, later on Picard states the Enterprise E has only 24 decks! Oops, somebody did not pay attention.

235,TrekkerForever,I found First Contact to be the most overrated Trek film ever!,2,31 May 2009,"As much as I like The Next Generation television show, I found their movies to be nothing more than extended episodes of the television show. Generations was nothing more but a real series finale for the show. First Contact was nothing more but a continuation of the cliffhanger, Best of Both Worlds, Insurrection was just another bad episode of the show with a bigger budget, and Nemesis was another attempt at ripping off earlier better movies.I enjoyed the special effects in First Contact, and I liked the acting, but I found the storyline, especially weak. The ending, involving destroying plasma coolants in the engineering department was one of the weakest science fiction endings ever. The crew could have shot them at the beginning to avoid all the headaches. Instead we get two hours of jumbled action, and over the top performances. I'm sorry, but I didn't enjoy this film as much as some other people did.I found First Contact to be nothing more than a remake of The Best Of Both Worlds with a very weak side plot regarding a drunken Zephram Cochrane, and one of the weakest endings in Trek history, which is Data destroying the plasma coolants and killing all of the borg, despite the borg having taken over half of the ship. It was equally implausible and ridiculous at the same time. Thank goodness, Paramount finally moved away from those awful TNG films and went back to the TOS film series with JJ Abrams new Star Trek TOS film being the biggest Trek film of all time that is the first Oscar winner.Also, this had the WEAKEST ending of the entire Trek series!

236,Jim-E,Excellent work Number One!,10,16 March 2005,"Wow! Finally, a STAR TREK movie for EVERYONE.From the muted opening titles to the celebratory end credits, Jonathan frakes has done what so many other directors have failed to do: Open the movie-going world to the wonders of STAR TREK.Being an avid fan myself, you would think me biased. But I, like so many other followers out there, am all too aware of how geeky the franchise can be. Most of its shows and films rely much too heavily on headache-inducing technobabble and convoluted plot twists.But this film stands out among the rest.Picard's assimilation by the Borg was never shown in the TV series, although its after-effects were shown in a later episode. So fans never really got the FEELING of being swallowed up by the venomous Borg. We never saw how their instruments violated a man's body, their Collective thoughts hammering away at a man's soul.So what does Frakes do? OPEN up the movie with just that: Picard, enveloped in machinery, injected with tubes--a needle piercing his EYE for God's sake. By throwing it in our faces he not only thrilled the Trekkies, but also intrigued the Trek virgins, horrifying them with visions of how evil these creatures can be.Now I can waffle on for a century about the amazing space battle, the Enterprise under siege, and the ultimate destruction of the Borg's truly evil Queen.I won't.I can rain applause's on the producers, writers and directors for FINALLY giving the NEXT GEN crew a heart and soul, and making us sympathise with a crew who normally look down their noses at everything.I won't.All i'll say is this: watch the film. Forget it's STAR TREK (anathema to WAY too many viewers out there). Just enjoy a well-made film for what it is. And Frakes, I hope Paramount gave you a heavy pat on the back.Well done Number One.

237,nighteyesv,Storyline Premise Makes Absolutely No Sense,5,10 May 2016,"Okay, so the Borg supposedly travel back in time to stop the human race from developing warp technology so they will be helpless to prevent assimilation. Sorry, but to start with an entire federation fleet was wiped out by a single Borg cube they are already helpless if the Borg had been serious and used a handful of ships like they have when assimilating other species they would have been victorious. Secondly, the Borg have a motto ""We will add your biological AND technological distinctiveness to our own"". Traveling back in time and deliberately sabotaging human advances in technology would provide them with far less technological distinctiveness to add to their own and the Borg Queen made it clear in an episode from Voyager she was in no way impressed by human biology. In Voyager it was mentioned that even the Borg have standards and they won't even make the effort to assimilate a species if it is too technologically primitive so for the Borg to go back and prevent humans from reaching the point where they become worthy of assimilation doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

245,icetrayhayes,Best Trek up to 1996,10,3 December 2002,"Star Trek: First Contact, up to that point, was the best Star Trek movie ever. It had everything it needed, the hero (Picard), the villan (the Borg), and plenty of action. It was a classic, one you can easily remember throughout the years. As someone that has followed Star Trek, especially The Next Generation all of my life from early childhood, this movie allowed me to see a side of the characters that I've never seen before, put in a situation that they have never been in before. I love Picard's personal conflict in this movie with the Borg because of his past and how he wants revenge on them. I like how more of how Data with his emmotion chip was shown. It is the first time really that they've shown Data in an emmotional situation, being captured and seduced by the Borg queen. Plus, you get to see more of the history of the Star Trek universe, with Zefram Cochrane, who you've only heard about briefly in Star Trek episodes. And, finally, my favorite scene in First Contact is near the end where Picard and Lily are alone in the conference room where Lily is trying to convince Picard to activate the self destruct to destroy the Enterprise and the Borg. Overall, this is a great movie that I believe the most people, Trek fans or not, will enjoy.",Star Trek - First Contact
246,ashley-120,Not just the best Star Trek film,10,23 February 2005,"Probably my favourite film of all time. The thing about First Contact is that it's not just about Star Trek. If you don't like Star Trek but can live through the first 20 minutes you'll find a gem of a movie which is as much about the future of humanity & an invention so wonderful as it is about Yet More Star Trek Plot.Warp Speed - they've been saying that since Captain Kirk. But how did it happen? and why might it all not happen, our future could be in ruins and one flight of one makeshift spacecraft some time after world war III will make all the difference.The on-screen relationship between Picard & Lily is totally magic, as is the relationship between the Enterprise crew members - you get a sense of team, of family.First Contact is one film I enjoy watching again & again. The flight of the Phoenix is one scene I totally love, along with the end scenes.The only sad thing about the movie is that you come away and deep down you know there is no Cochrain, no FTL engine around the corner.

But, as usual with my predictions, I was proved wrong and I was taken on a wild journey with this film.It's safe to say the best point of this film - Is the Space-Battle at the beginning. Who can argue against a good fight? Federation ships vs a Cube on a Vendetta.To be honest, I don't have much to say about the film - but like the title says, its easily the best Star Trek film - full of action, and story line.

He loved so much we were up till midnight making fake tricorders and com-badges so we could play star trek and pretend Borg were around his house. We even put flash lights on fake squirt guns to make them look like phaser rifles. This is the best star trek movie (Star Trek:Generations and the Undiscovered Country after). When that movie rental store went out of business (the one were I rented First Contact.) I bought that same star trek first contact I brought over to my friends house a few years earlier. Now when ever I go over there I bring it over. Anyway, best start trek movie out there. 5 stars.P.S. If your thinking of buying it, buy the VHS holographic cover First Contact (very cool).

252,WiseQuac,"Okay movie, but disappointing",6,24 April 1999,"I am a Star Trek fan, and watched every episode of the original series, and many of the episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I did not like the movie much, but if you can't think of anything but Star Trek, you should check out this movie, although you probably already have =).Now, onto the mini-review.  This movie takes place six years after the two-part Next Generation episode ""The Best of Both Worlds"", which actually is similar in length to the movie.  Make sure you see ""The Best of Both Worlds"" first, to get a primer on the Borg and to understand most of the things this movie refers to (including the certain assimilation).I think this movie really took away from some of the best parts of Star Trek: The Next Generation.  Two examples:Data having an emotion chip.  Data was interesting because he did not have emotions, and even though he turned it off part-way through, it still makes his role in the movie less special.The Borg Queen = bad idea.  The Borg are Borg because they are not individual, but rather a collective conciousness.  Having one Borg that controls them just doesn't work.  If you've seen both First Contact and Best of Both Worlds you know what I mean, because in Best of Both Worlds the Borg are just plain neat, and in First Contact they come across differently.Overall, this movie made the Borg less special, Data less special, and even though it reveals a lot about Star Trek history I just don't recommend it. If you don't know much about Star Trek but just want to find out what all this Borg stuff is about, watch Best of Both Worlds instead.  Don't bother with First Contact.",Star Trek - First Contact
253,dulaan,Impressive,10,26 June 1999,"I have never been a real fan of Star Trek mostly because of it's lack of a story. ""ST: First Contact"" changed that opinion. It greatly impressed me because it has a lot of features that ""Generations"" didn't have. This one has a good story, action, music and special effects. And not to forget, good actors. This is what I would call an excellent Sci-Fi movie.....",Star Trek - First Contact
254,drayvan,The best Star Trek Movie of all,10,31 October 1999,"This is by far the best of the Star Trek saga.  The story line was solid and upheld the traditions of classic Star trek very well.  The settings and special effects were realistic and the cast maintained their characters true to form while adding to the viewers insight into their unique personalities. I was glad to see that they finally got rid of Geordi's visor, it was long in coming.  I thought that the exploration into the Borg society linked together with the paradox of time travel made for an excellent story.I've seen several complaints about both the time travel and the new insights into the Borg, but I have to disagree with those comments... I thought they were nit-picky and trivial.  Time travel is always an iffy thing in any storyline, but it seemed natural that the Borg would try it... they tried everything else.  As far as the introduction of the Borg queen, that seemed natural as well.  The Borg have always been portrayed as a collective of minds, but the presence of a Borg Queen (or Queens) seems not only plausible but more than likely.As I watched ST: First Contact and was introduced to the notion of a Borg Queen, I found many of the unanswered questions in my mind about the workings of the Borg society coming together and being answered all at once. How else is a collective of individual minds going to remain focused and unified?  How else could a collective maintain the order and discipline of billions of minds trying to work together as one... They are part machine.. so a Borg Queen/Central Processor seems a natural conclusion to me.
At first, I thought that the existance of a Borg Queen(s) would have been introduced much earlier, especially after Voyager picked up Seven-of-nine, but then the thought struck me that the individual Borg might not even be aware of the existence of such a Queen.. not as we would think of her.  To them she might have just seemed to be a central accessing sight, or hub, for connection to the rest of the Collective.  Who knows.. there's still a lot that hasn't been revealed about the Borg.Overall, I thought it was great, imaginative, and in no way as disappointing as the first STNG movie, Generations.  I would say that the only thing that bugged me about , well, all of the movies.. from one to eight... is the one-liners.  Some of them were good, but it's obvious that the writers were just trying to throw in some of the mainstream movie ""pleasers"" such as ""I'll be Back,"" from Terminator.  I think the writers, or whoever made the decision to do that, should just stick to what works for Star Trek and leave the one-liners to Schwarzenegger and Willis.  It is purely out of character for the Star Trek characters and the Start Trek Universe doesn't need it...",Star Trek - First Contact
255,rghawki,One of the best sci-fi movies ever!,10,15 November 1999,"This is one of the two best Star Trek movies ever made (the other being ""Wrath of Khan""). Everything about this film is superb.... acting, set design, special effects, plot, and action. The story progresses at a breathtaking pace, and from the first 10 minutes when the Enterprise is locked in a life-and-death struggle with one of the best villains in all of sci-fi history (the Borg), to a perfect ending; there isn't a wasted or redundant moment. This is a film that both trekkers and non-trekkers can enjoy because the film explains enough about the back-story to get non-fans up to speed, and does it in a way that will keep the fans interest (check out the excellent opening sequence that introduces Picard's first encounter with the Borg and explains much of his implacable and obsessive attitude towards them throughout the film).In addition to fine performances from the crew (highlighted as always by Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard), the supporting cast is more than equal to the task. Its too bad that the crew didn't bring Alfre Woodward back home with them........ she's one of the very few actors/actresses in Star Trek history who have been able to match Patrick Stewart's personality, acting skills, and histrionics. Also, I thought I detected a touch of romance between the two that could have been further developed at another time.James Cromwell makes a perfect Zefrem Cochrane. It was a humorous touch to portray him as somewhat of an anti-hero, in contrast to the god-like reverence with which the characters in the film viewed him from a distance of 300 years.The protagonists in the film, the Borg, have never looked more dangerous. I'm glad that this film returned them to their ""roots"", unlike their last few appearances in the television series in which they were becoming a little too domesticated.This is a film to savor for any science fiction fan. 9.5/10.0 !",Star Trek - First Contact

EVERYONE had screen time. The Enterprise looked absolutely beautiful and the ILM special effects ROCKED! I watched the special features on the newest release, and that was the first time ever they used a CGI Enterprise in shots. Even Commander LaForge had a moment when he breaks down to Dr. Cocraine how his will get him his own statue. The shot of the Borg infested Earth as they traveled back in time was awesome as well.

As good as The Wrath of Kahn was, I was and will always be a bigger fan and have more respect for the Next Generation Crew over the Original Series. The score for this movie by Jerry Goldsmith is quite possibly one of the best scores for any movie, ever, in existence.  It creates the exact aura necessary for the movie.  This flick featured great performances from Patrick Stewart (honestly, one of the best actors ever, just watch the episodes and see what a bad ass he is, even when he's a minor character)(Capt. Picard), Brent Spiner (Lt Cmd Data), Alice Krige as the Borg Queen, James Cromwell (Cochrane), and Michael Dorn as Lt. Cmd. Worf. Which isn't to say that the others didn't do a good job, but their wasn't much to them.  It was cool seeing Neal McDonough in the movie, even though it's horribly disappointing that he wont be able to come back for any more. So back to the movie, great plot, and the second best enemy in the Star Trek franchise (the first be Q, who could never get a movie, i mean he's cool, but there's no point in giving him one).  Too bad Voyager had to go and make the Borg so wussy and weak after all their bad-assiness in TNG.  Really really looking forward to 10 as 9 was entertaining, but really just a mediocre episode.  And Generations was actually a good movie too, so you naysayers should give it a second chance, I mean, Malcolm McDowell, fantastic lighting (i mean really, really good) and the beautiful and powerful destruction of the Enterprise-D, how can you ask for more?",Star Trek - First Contact
266,cj32001,Another Addition to the Star Trek Universe,9,13 July 2009,"Star Trek: First Contact, directed & produced by Rick Berman, is yet another installment based upon the long lived Star Trek Franchise. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the USS Enterprise must follow the Borg through a time vortex into the early days of war torn humanity. It is here where they are faced with the obligation to subdue the Borg's attempts at assimilating humanity and to make sure that Zefram Cochrane completes his first warp drive test flight. It will only be then that the human race makes first contact with another race is made and the original time line is restored. One of Star Trek's motifs has always been based on preserving life. It was done so by eradicating the evils that used to drive human behavior such as greed, violence, and war. By using these ideals as a base concept, Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek's creator, was able to generate a possible future in which humanity is freed from all prejudices and lives in ""relative"" peace throughout the galaxy.",Star Trek - First Contact
267,redspuder,First Contact,7,15 September 2008,"This is my favourite of the Trek movies, and although people complain about the dark design work not being part of Gene Roddenbury's ""message"" I'd wager it is closer to Roddenbury's idea then most of the other installments.Roddenbury's utopian idea was of a society of different races, colours and genders (individuals) working together to overcome bad people who want to do bad things.The Borg are the anti-Star Trek, they are the same, no individuals. They force their way of life on others, without feeling and without any care or consideration for what they may want.Cochrane symbolises us: paranoid, reliant on money and cynical. He's built his ship for personal gain but by the end of the film is transformed by the consequences of the Phoenix's first warp flight.Data desires to be Human, to be something he's not, but in the end it's his own non-human lack of emotion and reliance on calculation and logic that saves the day.This is a film that celebrates individualism, understanding and team-work against intolerance, mindlessness and brutality. It also offers hope in the form of the Phoenix: bringing to life a bright future from the ashes of the failed old one. Maybe it's not too late after all.This is Roddenbury's vision, just repackaged in a dark action film casing that sells well in this day and age.",Star Trek - First Contact
268,bradlh50,First Contact: A Success,8,31 May 2010,"This was my first time ever seeing a Star Trek video and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I feel it was primarily the solid character base that drew me in while I watched the film. As I have recently seen Avatar in 3D, I am confident that it wasn't the special effects that impressed me. I also felt the main plot was simply average as it built off common themes including, time travel, contacting aliens, and saving the world. None of these elements are particularly unique, thus I must conclude that the characters and their personal journeys are what made this movie a success. Captain Jean-Luc Picard in particular was a very dynamic character. Initially he had a strong sense of revenge and wounded pride from his past involvement with the Borg, as this became mixed with his desires to save his crew, his ship, and his loyal friend Lt. Commander Data his actions became increasing intriguing. Lt. Commander Data's development was also quite interesting. For those of you who are unaware, Lt. Commander Data is an android who desires nothing more than to be human. After Lt. Commander Data is captured by the Borg, he is partially given this very thing as a way to exploit a weakness. Throughout his experience after being captured he is engaged in an intriguing internal battle that really can't be given justice with words. A third character I found interesting was the Borg Queen. She wasn't very dynamic throughout the film, however she was very unique and clever. In these three characters, and many others, I feel the actions are very believable and that this was a key component in making the whole movie a success.I also enjoyed the clear-cut good guy vs. bad guy portrayal in the film. It was very clear that the Borg were bad and all the humans from past and future were good. It was clear that the Borg needed to be stopped to dramatically save humanity and of course they were. And after all the Borg's biological parts disintegrated in the plasma and the good aliens were drinking whiskey with crazy ole' Dr. Zefram Cochrane I couldn't but feel good about life in general. Between the classic clear-cut good vs. evil and this classic happy ending, I felt that this entire movie was crafted to draw in a side of moviegoers that is often neglected. It was a pleasant respite that I can only hope will be matched in other Star Trek movies that I will be watching in the near future.",Star Trek - First Contact

Though the movie may seam like an action flick on the surface, deep down it has some very good morals, the movie takes place some 50 years after the Eugenics Wars, where the Earth is completely destroyed by war, apart from the Borg side of the story, this film tells of a man (Zefram Cochrane) who took a nuclear warhead and made it into a ship that could travel at warp, that of course attracts the Vulcans who come to Earth and make First Contact and a new era of peace begins! The only thing that sets this movie back is a small nitpick, about how the Borg travel to the past to assimilate Earth. The question everybody's asking is: Why didn't they just time travel first, then go to Earth, instead of time traveling at Earth where the Enterprise can follow them and foil their plans?! Or why don't they just try a do-over? The producers will have to work something out about the Borg's inconsistency in many factors.",Star Trek - First Contact

It was boring and an insult to the original TV series, The TV series showed some imagination. This was bland. And the silly emotional arguments between two leading characters were just embarrassing and were unnecessary to the plot. The Borg weren't even scary, and would attack sometimes and not attack other times. Why the rocket ship had to reach warp speed only became apparent at the end? That part was handled very badly and the plot became confusing. I was a keen fan of Dr Who in the early days, with matt black painted hardboard sets and gravel pits for other planets, but the scripts showed imagination and were fabulous.

Star Trek movies that mess with time, like this one and TOS #4, are always cool. What's really neat is to sit down and think about the temporal mechanics of this movie. From what I understand about temporal phenomena, the Borg could not really change the past, they could only A)No time traveling allowed B) Create a new timestream or C)Always fail in their attempt to change the past. So, since Picard and his crew managed to stop the Borg, they obviously failed to create a new timestream and fall under category C. Picard didn't create a new timestream either, otherwise he would not have been able to return to the 24th century, at least not his 24th century.

Continuing the idea of the one minded alien species the Borg on their quest to Perfection the Borg lifestyle reflects what George Orwell communicated through Animal Farm. The Brog use a process called assimilation in which nanites are inject into an organism and they work to alter the victims body, alter them to be Borg. Assimilation is worse than death, it takes away everything an individual is leaves them with nothing. No soul, memories, individual thought no individual humanity. Further more the process leaves them linked to the Borg hive mind and they are plagued with several hundred billion voices and thoughts of several hundred billion. This reflects the lives of those that endured the hardships that were brought about by the new rules in Russia, no material possession people were forced into a life a poverty where the poor got poorer and the rich got richer. Along with the fantastic metaphor with Earth's political history, an exciting plot, the best special effects and performances from Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner that are second to nobody First Contact does not only have the makings of a box office hit it is an iconic film in relation to Russia during the mid twentieth century.

274,klaatuma-2,The worst of all the films!,1,29 October 2008,"Anyone who liked this film couldn't possibly have seen the original episode ""Metamorphosis"" where the character of Zefraim Cochrane was originated. This movie blasphemes his character and reputation. I hate it when writers have no respect for the history of the series. It's as if it was written by committee - ""let's put in a chase scene here, a Borg fight there, lot's of special effects"" - nobody cares about story or continuity. Not only is there a lack of continuity with the original series, but whole Next Generation story lines have disappeared - like Troi and Worf being romantically involved. This movie was worse than Star Trek 5!",Star Trek - First Contact
275,daniel_pickens,"Great Movie, Read Brief Review",10,27 February 2005,"I have to start off by saying, that I am a Startrek buff. I LOVE everything there is to do with Startrek, and have viewed every episode of TNG and DS9 ever aired. I have also seen every Startrek movie created, and could name at least 50 people that resided on the Enterprise during TNG (not necessarily the entire show, some moved on, died, etc.).I feel that this was probably tied for the best Startrek movie ever created. I feel that First Contact and Generations are the best two ever created. This movie combines a lot of action, as well as realistic predicament, and very realistic scenarios. This certainly fit into the storyline as plausible, and never once made you ask how did this happen.The short-version of this review is that the film was extremely successful, and very good quality. It had good acting, a great storyline, and pretty good special effects. It also had some nice upgrades to ship and uniforms that look absolutely fabulous, that almost make me want to wear one all the time! Great movie for Startrek and Scifi fans. This movie would be a good movie for any Scifi fan, with an easy storyline to follow, that doesn't require much previous TNG knowledge to follow.Below is a long, drawn out commentary. If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read further. I have worked hard to keep it spoiler free, and have made notations on most of my information, of how it was already available from the series, so that it is not considered spoiler material. Nonetheless, if you haven't seen it, view it, and then read my opinion, and see what you think first.***Below might contain references to the movie, but they are not anywhere close to spoilers. Just the same, wanted to give fair warning.The storyline is that the Borg invade the Federation, and attack Earth. They go back in time, to perform a mission. (This much was stated on the back of the cover, so no spoilers there.) I often wondered, back when TNG was on the air, if the Borg would try and do this during the series. It was very plausible, because we know the power of the Borg, and we know that we would be no match for them. The only thing that could have given us an advantage, would have been Captain Picard, due to his experience with being assimilated during the series. Also, we already knew that time travel was possible, and that the Borg were experimenting with it. So, that does not leave us with any jumps in logic.The movie was well written, acted, and directed. First off, tip of the hats to the costume and set designers. I LOVED the new uniforms, and thought that they were certainly much better looking than standard red, yellow, and blue ones from the show. Also, the new ship looked very realistic (again, we knew the Enterprise D was destroyed, so it only made sense to have a new ship built, and included in the movie). The actors put a lot of hard work into it, and it shows. I especially want to say good job to Brent Spiner, as he did an excellent job on data, acting the part, which you will understand once you watch the movie. Also, worth mentioning was the actor that played Zephram Cochran (I can't remember the name off of the top of my head). He performed well, made the character seem very realistic for the personality portrayed. Another comment on the characters would have to be about ""Lily"". I feel that the first part of the character, when she has the little fainting spell, was scripted and acted very well, but the script has her dealing with her ""situation"", a lot better than she should have. Even a strong character would have been a bit more reluctant to do what she did. I think that she took it a bit too well, but that is certainly not a major thing, and it's only my opinion.I would like to also say that the special effects were pretty good, especially for the resources that they used.***Random Knowledge Tidbit: The green plate used on assimilation tables in all of the Borg ships during TNG, were actually store-bought electric lamps. They were the same as the ones that you can buy in the store, that are sensitive to touch, sound, etc. These are the ones that pulse out electricity, similar to the electric balls that have flowing strands of electricity touching the globe, but on a flat plate instead.",Star Trek - First Contact
276,ygarciaraul,Another time travel plot in Star Trek?,5,4 April 2005,"When I first saw this film in the theater, I found it thrilling, exciting, and any other positive emotions. There was great reason for this - the Borg! To see these ideologically threatening species on the big screen was a treat. However, as I became older, I realized that the film actually hurt the Borg. It made them look like two-dimensional villains who just want to plunder earthlings.In Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Borg represented a distinct idea in Trek social theory. Whereas the Klingons were warriors who justified violence, the Cardassians with their pride and prejudice, the Federation with a League of Nations setup, the Borg consider sovereignty and individuality irrelevant. They are indeed utilitarian; The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one, much like Vulcan logic. Still, the Vulcans are more isolated. The Borg are a virus whose purpose is to simply perpetuate itself while evolving in the process.Why should the Borg have a queen? It is more interesting that the Borg communicate simultaneously to each other, like quantum mechanics, where a particle can occupy two vast distances at the same time. Jesuit philosopher Tielhard de Chardin thought of a separate level for consciousness called the noosphere. The Borg seem to be at this level of collective consciousness. Incredible. To have a film that compartmentalize the Borg to another Trek villain to defeat is an injustice to the Borg. There is so much to draw from them.Moreover, why another time travel scenario? Is Star Trek so keen on convoluting its own universe? (For instance, what happened to that Borg drone that was floating to space in the scene on the Enterprise E's deflector? Talk about not caring for consequences! The usual case in time travel stories!) What would that serve for storytelling? How about some more innovative ideas? Star Trek, thankfully, will cease that ""Enterprise"" mess. Enough franchise! Take a break - for a long time and let history see if Star Trek still carries that optimistic message of humanity, or even honor Gene Roddenberry.",Star Trek - First Contact
277,warrenabaxter,"Even if you don't love Trek, you may love this film...",9,29 April 2006,"I'm not the biggest Trek fan in the world, let me start off. I was weary when I heard that Frakes would be directing this, but, in conjunction with Rick Berman and the other writers, he did a fantastic job (not sure what happened with Insurrection...). There is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, adventure and action. It is a true Star Trek film, through and through. I suggest you buy it for those rainy days sitting at home, it'll definitely cheer you up. Jerry Goldsmith's score is an uncanny match for First Contact's appealing visuals. Our first glimpse of the Enterprise-E, the fanfare in the background is close to perfect. Aside from the few script discrepancies (i.e. the number of decks) the script is amazing. Alice Krige's performance as the Borg Queen will send shivers down your spine and make your skin crawl. The only downfall is that great characters like Crusher and LaForge don't get a chance to really shine. Patrick Stewart is, as always, marvelous and you can't get close to Brent Spiner. All in all, I'd have to give this one two thumbs up!!",Star Trek - First Contact

279,herrkirf,Best Trek Movie ever,10,10 January 2006,"First Contact is one of the best Star Trek and Science Fiction Movies i've ever seen. It's a wonderful Story with two interesting Arcs: Zefram Cochrane's first Warpflight with his ""Phoenix"" and - of course - Picard's fight against the Borg. Very good Special Effects and Actors. My favourite Scenes are the Spacebattle against the Borg and the First Contact Scene between Zefram Cochrane an the Vulcan. Very good Job by Rick Berman an Jonathan Frakes. Also very good work by the Art Directors, they created the Borg. Very realistic. Last but not least: The New Enterprise NCC-1701-E. It's a wonderful Starship, created by John Eaves. He did a good Job designing that Spaceship. Much better then the model from the TV Series ""The Next Generation"". Best Star Trek Motion Picture ever.",Star Trek - First Contact
280,apollocreed-54703,I don't get the hype,6,23 September 2021,"As a lifelong fan of the Star Trek movie franchise ( my introduction to Trek as a child of the '80s was the movie series), it took me a while to accept the Next Generation crew. I eventually grew to love the series and the intelligent stories it told. Though you did get some episodes which were ""ok"" and pretty standard tv fare. This film feels to me like a decent two part episode and not much more that .Compared with earlier films featuring the original series crew,the Next Gen films feel a lot less cinematic. Perhaps because the jump from dodgy tv series look to full blown special effects movies was so huge for the original cast. I really don't get why this one is so beloved, to be honest.",Star Trek - First Contact
