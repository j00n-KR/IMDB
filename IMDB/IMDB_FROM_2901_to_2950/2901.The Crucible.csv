0,bkoganbing,The Elusive Crime Of Witchcraft,10,11 July 2013,"Arthur Miller is gone now, but he lived long enough to see his master work The Crucible finally on the big screen. Back when it was on Broadway it was deemed too controversial in those paranoid days of the Fifties. The Crucible was Miller's answer to the witch hunting House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of Joe McCarthy. He saw parallels between the Salem Witch Trials where several people were put to death in that sad town for the elusive crime of witchcraft. Miller even got to adapt his work to the screen and did it so well that the stage origins aren't even noticeable.One of the things I marveled when viewing the film was Miller's mastery of the Puritan culture. He must have done some heavy research into it to capture so well the spirit of those times and how they paralleled the McCarthy Fifties.But I would take a different tack in talking about The Crucible. It is a wonderful condemnation of a religious based society as the Puritans were in those days. These people came to the new world to seek freedom of conscience to worship the Creator/Deity in their own way. No sooner do they get here than a society is built by them excluding others who don't buy into their view of things. It would be another century before the novel idea was seriously raised about having NO established religion. It hasn't taken fully hold yet as witness by the Moslem theocratic states like Iran or the newly found influence of the Russian Orthodox Church in some of the former Soviet Union. Not to mention here where after thirty or so years the influence of bible beaters in the body politic seems finally to be receding.Daniel Day-Lewis plays John Proctor the farmer who is by no means an ideal hero is the man forced into martyrdom simply because he won't denounce his neighbors as witches and warlocks. Joan Allen is magnificent as Mrs. Proctor who pays for her husband's indiscretions with teenage flirt Winona Ryder. All of this gets started when Ryder and several of her peers go out to dance in the moonlight, strictly forbidden in the Puritan society. Who led them into this is Charlayne Woodard, an African slave and recently over from Africa where she remembers her customs from her tribe. The girls get spotted and all that follows come from some young girls who rather than face punishment for breaking their strict code say the devil made them do it and start naming friends and neighbors as witches. This whole business gives the girls an opportunity to escape punishment and settle some personal scores. And it spreads to the adults who ought to know better.I've also thought that Arthur Miller might also have been influenced by Lillian Hellman's These Three which is also about tattle tale young girls and the harm they cause. The parallels are too obvious to ignore.Though it took half a century to make it to the screen, The Crucible was worth every second of the wait.",The Crucible
1,SnoopyStyle,great writing,8,27 June 2015,"It's 1692 Salem, Massachusetts. Village girls led by Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) dance in the woods with Barbadian slave Tituba. Abigail kills a chicken and drinks its blood while the cauldron boiled. Abigail's uncle Reverend Samuel Parris (Bruce Davison) discovers the girls. Betty Parris faints. Reverend Hale (Rob Campbell) is brought in. Abigail accuses Tituba and the group convinces Hale that the devil is loose upon the town. Abigail is obsessed with John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and aims to get rid of his wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen). Righteous Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield) arrives determined to rid every trace of the devil. Greedy Parris uses the opportunity to accuse his neighbors and steal their lands. Proctor servant Mary Warren recants and Hale sees the truth. However Danforth and the course of judgment will not swerve.Based on the play by Arthur Miller which was inspired by the MacArthur hearings, this is thinly veiled accusation against all witch trials. The writing is sharp. Winona Ryder is a compelling villain. Daniel Day-Lewis is solid. Paul Scofield is perfect. Joan Allen has great Protestant righteousness. Some may accuse the group of overacting but that's the nature of witch trials. The movie does need some darker cinematic visuals to match the subject matter. Nevertheless, this is well-made adaptation of a play.",The Crucible
2,Prismark10,These witches are not for burning,5,2 July 2014,"The Crucible is a popular text in British schools. Not only based on the real life incident of the Salem witch trials but also a political allegory to the McCarthy hearings in the US Congress in the early 1950s which inspired Arthur Miller to write the play.The movie has been adapted by Miller himself and the watchword is hysteria how like an ether it can easily be inflamed leading to blind panic with no morality. The film was released in 1996 yet just a few years earlier there was ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, clan fights in Somalia. Mass hysteria was alive and well and something Miller would had been well aware of. In that sense the film should be more than a historical product of witch trials in the 17th century and communist witch hunts in the 1950s but something that is relevant even today.The film begins with young girls conjuring love potions in the fields and then forced to tell lies that the they had been possessed by the devil when they had been caught by the local minister. They start dragging innocent people into the fold by accusing them of witchcraft, before long petty vendettas are being settled with accusations being hurled with ulterior motives.Once the inquisitors arrive, accusations are made simply to save themselves from hanging no matter other innocent people will hang instead unless they confess or accuse others.Winona Ryder leads the young women but she is also infatuated with a married farmer, John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) with whom she had a short affair and now uses the events to get rid of his wife by accusing her of witchcraft.However the adaptation does not succeed because the mass hysteria by the girls also looks rather silly, more a badly acted play rather than a prestigious film adaptation. The film also loses its parable element as only late on do you get the inkling with the McCarthy hearings which inspired the play in the first place and is such an important part of the play's DNA.Day Lewis is fine, you see his authentic facial hair, some early scenes of working the land but there is the now trademark hamminess here and there which his fans mistake for great acting. Paul Scofield who once made his name in The Man for all Seasons plays the reverse role here as the hanging judge determined to cleanse this small Massachusetts town despite the consequences and in his solemn way gives an acting masterclass.",The Crucible
3,mark.waltz,The tongue is mightier evil than the sword.,8,26 September 2017,"One of the classic theatrical dramas is from a modern playwright whose Broadway credits are the types of stories that creates legendary theatrical experiences. I've seen two stage versions of this brilliant play (only just over 60 years old) and every ounce deserving of classic status.This is a story of the lusts that tear young women apart, so in love that they turn to the dark arts to get the man they want. Rumors of witchcraft spreads through the small village (where a ton of locales seem to congregate), and events which they do not understand they blame on the powers of the darkness and set out to destroy anyone and everyone who may have helped raise the level of evil. From gossip comes paranoia. From that comes injustice, and from that comes unjust executions while the young girls, as lead by the determined Winona Ryder, desperately try to keep each of the names clean, even at the expense of somebody else's life.The seemingly quiet but vindictive Ryder has intense feelings for farmer Daniel Day Lewis, secretly flattered but determined to remain faithful to his wife (Joan Allen). Easy to blame is African servant girl Charlaine Woodard (treated with disrespect even though she's presumably a paid servant, not a slave. The tension explodes thanks to the malicious flapping of the tongue, even striking down Rebecca Nurse (Elizabeth Lawrence) whose reputation for compassion and good deeds is known way past the town. By the time this occurs, the girls are all twittering like attacking birds.With a modern retelling but every inch in the era of the real Salem witch trials (1692), it is a reminder that early colonial America suffered from many of the same hypocrisies that caused the Europeans to flea to a new world in the first place. This is outstanding in practically every detail, an issue that still rings true today.",The Crucible
4,lee_eisenberg,cross to bear,7,17 April 2006,"Arthur Miller's death last year brings to mind all his plays, including ""The Crucible"". This one of course focuses on the Salem witch hunts in 1692. According to what I've heard, Miller based his play on McCarthyism. That was a good analogy, but it apparently led to an inaccuracy.But anyway, it's still a really good movie. The overall point is that it shows what religious fundamentalism leads to (for the record, these were probably descendants of the people who came over on the ""Mayflower"" - so much for our image of exceptionally benevolent history). Daniel Day-Lewis is intense as Puritan John Proctor. It's almost surprising to see Winona Ryder in this kind of movie, given the kind of roles with which we usually associate her, but she also does a good job as Abigail Williams, who accuses Proctor's wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen) of being a witch. Also starring Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison and Jeffrey Jones.Still, a movie about the witch hunts that's apparently more accurate is ""Three Sovereigns for Sarah"".",The Crucible
5,rmax304823,Bullying Is An Ancient Art.,7,1 September 2015,"It's a message movie and it resonates. Willful belief in absurdities plagues the town of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1693. A handful of young girls, caught dancing in the woods, begin to claim they were possessed by the devil and they make accusations of witchcraft. It leads to more than twenty hangings and other deaths by execution.When Arthur Miller wrote the play in the early 50s, it was his way of speaking out against the communist witch hunts of his time. And indeed the trajectories of the movements bear similarities. It starts with someone craving attention, first blaming someone who is not only harmless but marginalized -- insane people, the senile, the very poor. Then it leads to overreach. The dozen hysterical girls of Salem begin to claim that spirits of a higher caliber have haunted them at night -- the spirit of the preacher's wife, for instance, which goes a little too far.Historically, Senator Joseph McCarthy began with real spies and real suspects but his claims grew more and more outrageous until he inspired the John Birch Society to consider President Eisenhower nothing more than ""a communist dupe."" And then McCarthy accused the US Army and General George Marshall of harboring communists. It was all a bit much for the less than insane among our own citizenry.Now, of course, we can all cluck out tongues at such fantasies -- while presidential candidates now running would build an unscalable wall across the Mexican border and hunger for a wall across the Canadian border as well. The president is a gypsy changeling from Africa. Our strongest leaders turn into carnival barkers and we cheer them. That's not to mention worms in McDonalds' hamburgers. I guess -- I hope -- the less insane among us will reintroduce us to reality some day.In any case, that's the end of my spiel. I will now stand down from the speaker's platform if someone will give me a hand. Thank you, but you don't have to be so eager.The acting and the milieu are finely done. Winona Ryder does very well as the lustful young traitor and she handles the stylized speech all right. It's only when she's excited that a bit of Wynona, Ohio, peeps through Abigail Williams.In 1693, these were all Brits, not Americans. So Paul Scofield can enter the movie as a judge who wants to be fair but is himself possessed by his interpretation of the Bible and his loyalty to what he perceives God to be. Those baggy eyes and that pebbled chin are just villainous enough.Joan Allen as an innocent victim is a fine actress but she doesn't have much to do except look made of stone. Make up has turned her face sere and gray. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the better actors of his generation but he's stuck in the part of the audience proxy -- the man of principle, guilty only of having boned Winona Ryder in the barn, who sees through the fraudulence of the accusations, the trial, and the ensuing executions. He sees the foolishness. We can see it too, even if we can't see our own.There's a much less lavishly budgeted story of the witch trials around too, ""Three Sovereigns For Sister Sarah,"" I think. It's well worth catching.",The Crucible
6,moonspinner55,Letting Lucifer loose in Salem,5,17 March 2007,"To cover her sullied reputation--and to strike back at the married farmer she had a brief affair with--a young woman in 17th century Salem creates mass hysteria with stories of witchcraft. Yet another version of Arthur Miller's famous play, adapted for the screen by Miller himself, and featuring a powerhouse group of actors who work this mercurial story for all its worth. Unfortunately, the twitching, face-slapping histrionics and pinched overview of how small town gossip can topple even the most faithful parson is only intriguing for those unfamiliar with the material. For others, the florid handling may be enough to compensate for an overall feeling of staid predictability, as the plot grinds along covering every overcooked detail. The actors are good, particularly Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth and Winona Ryder in the totally unsympathetic role of Abigail Williams, but to give this piece some new cinematic life, a filmmaker like Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino was needed. Director Nicholas Hytner is fond of old-guard pomp and sweep, yet he shows no spirit--he approaches Miller's text like a guilty choir boy--and he slows down all the biggest sequences for a numbing solemnity. ** from ****",The Crucible
7,edwagreen,The Crucible is Much Ado About Nothing *,4,16 April 2009,"Miserable, off-the-wall film dealing with Arthur Miller's supposed masterpiece.Let's get something straight. This idea that the idea of the film is to emulate the witch hunt of the 1950s is absolutely ridiculous. It's a totally different genre, people, places and misery.Are we to believe that Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are the equivalents of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg? Are we to believe that Allen is not to be put to death for practicing witchcraft right away because she is with child and we know the church's position on abortion?With it all, there is a very good performance by Paul Scofield as the chief magistrate.Hypocrisy is shown by most of the characters here, especially Bruce Davison. He portrays a priest who is as phony as they come.I love the way the town people turn on one another. Perhaps, Elia Kazan should have directed this film.Among other things, this film is boring, Winona Ryder screams like the holy lunatic she is supposed to be. What's so magnificent about Daniel Day-Lewis here?",The Crucible
8,evanston_dad,These Witches Sure Can Yell,5,16 June 2009,"The world didn't really need yet one more version of the Arthur Miller parable set during the Salem witch trials. But if the world insisted on giving us another, why didn't it give us a better one? Stage director Nicholas Hytner had tried his hand at movie making before (""The Madness of King George"") and not done too badly, but you wouldn't know it from this film. These actors, some very good ones (Daniel Day-Lewis) and some not (Winona Ryder), act like they've never been in front of a camera before, and scream every line like they're doing a stage version in Madison Square Garden. Not a very subtle play to begin with, ""The Crucible"" is like a hammer hitting an anvil when played the way it is here.Joan Allen and Paul Scofield fare much better in quieter, much more reserved roles.Grade: C",The Crucible
9,Wuchakk,Over-the-top melodrama,5,16 June 2013,"The Salem witch trials that occurred from February 1692 to May 1693 resulted in 19 people hung, another slowly crushed to death and over 150 imprisoned. Historian George Lincoln Burr described it as a notorious case of mass hysteria and vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process.Since I love history and am a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis you would think that I'd love 1996' ""The Crucible."" But over the years I've seen a couple of clips from it and the film turned me off for some reason. It just struck me as so over-the-top. Yes, I realize that filmmakers always have to amp up the dramatics because they only have two hours to tell their story, but I mean over-the-top melodrama in the sense of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994). If you liked the way that film was done you'll probably love this one.Anyway, I finally decided to actually view ""The Crucible"" and give it the chance it deserves. It does have a lot going for it -- quality actors, authentic sets, costumes and locations (shot in Massachusetts and Nova Scotia) and a dialogue-driven approach. Unfortunately, the film's very first scene struck me as inauthentic. It shows several young girls escaping into the forest in the middle of the night to dance under the moonlight (one nude) and cast spells, led by a black woman from the village. This scene was ten times wilder than anything at Woodstock and yet we're to believe all these young Puritan girls felt liberated enough to do this in 1692? Right. I realize that something like this supposedly happened but it's just so amped-up in the movie that it strikes an unbelievable chord.I dismissed it, however, and continued to give the movie a chance, but the story and dialogue just failed to draw me into the dramatics.I think it's worth watching for the reasons cited above and the fact that it does give you a picture of what it was like back then, overdone as it is, and it does inspire you to research the events. Other than these factors, though, the movie fails, particularly with its hyper-melodramatic approach.GRADE: C+",The Crucible
10,gradyharp,"The Inquisition, The Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism, etc!",10,17 May 2006,"Arthur Miller's powerful play from 1953 became his screenplay in 1996 for this devastatingly gritty film THE CRUCIBLE. While some may make negative comparisons between the power of the theatrical piece versus the immediacy of the film, it really matters little. The story, based on fact, is terrifying and all too familiar in flavor with the Inquisition, the Holocaust, the witch hunts of McCarthy's time, the misdeeds of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, NSA wiretapping etc. Evil is evil and it must be addressed, and if this play/film helps us to recognize the madness of lies then it has served its purpose.The story is so well known that recounting it is superfluous: Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) seethes as the discarded harlot who slept with the noble John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and gains her revenge by naming Proctor's wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen) as a witch - a person who walks and communicates with the devil! As the disease of repression and superstition mounts, the citizenry of Salem calls in Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield) to try the accusations, and needless hangings of innocent victims occur until some semblance of reason is restored by John Proctor's fight for truth at the hanging post.As directed by Nicholas Hytner and photographed by Andrew Dunn, the dark atmosphere of Salem's dance with the devil is brilliantly captured. The cast is excellent, not only the stars (Day-Lewis, Scofield, Allen, Ryder), but also the multiple well realized small roles. But towering over it all is Arthur Miller's immensely pungent script, written in the English as spoken in 1692 and all the more flavorful for the atmosphere of the work. This is as powerful as realization of a play as has been transferred to the screen. It is a must see for everyone concerned about the current state of our country's welfare. Grady Harp",The Crucible
11,JamesHitchcock,A Fitting Adaptation,8,21 February 2014,"The Salem witch trials of 1692 have always gripped the American imagination, possibly precisely because they are something so un-American. America prides itself on being the ""New World"", modern, democratic and rational, yet the witch trials, and the superstitious, intolerant and authoritarian attitudes which produced them, seem very much of the Old World. Indeed, in some respects Americans of this period were more old-fashioned than the Mother Country. The last English witch trials had taken place ten years earlier, and by the 1690s belief in witchcraft was in decline. Arthur Miller's play ""The Crucible"" takes the witch-trials for its subject, but was also written as a critique of McCarthyism. Miller succeeded in his intention to such an extent that it is today difficult for any historian to write about the proceedings of the House Un- American Activities Committee without using the phrase ""witch hunt"", but whether this has done the play's long-term reputation any good is another matter. McCarthyism may have been a burning issue in the fifties, but today, at least to anyone under the age of eighty, the HUAC seems nearly as remote in time as the witch trials themselves. Moreover, the parallels that Miller draws between Salem and McCarthyism are not, in my opinion, persuasive. And yet I nevertheless regard this as one of the greatest tragedies written in English in the twentieth century. It has taken on a life of its own, independent of the political concerns that prompted it, and become a timeless work which still speaks to us today, not as a satire on a long-dead politician, but as a play about injustice and the struggle against it. Miller's hero, John Proctor, is a classic flawed tragic hero, a man who becomes involved in tragedy because of his human frailties. Proctor, a prosperous farmer, has been unfaithful to his wife Elizabeth with their maidservant, Abigail Williams, but has repented of his adulterous affair and, at his wife's request, dismissed Abigail from his service. These events come back to haunt him. Abigail is the leading figure in a group of girls and young women who begin to accuse their neighbours of witchcraft and who, in the prevailing climate of superstitious Puritanism, are readily believed by the authorities. Abigail, still obsessively in love with Proctor and consumed with hatred for his wife, accuses Elizabeth Proctor, who is arrested. Proctor's attempt to prove his wife's innocence backfires, and he is himself accused and sentenced to death. Told that his life will be spared if he confesses, he faces the dilemma of either saving his life by falsely confessing to a crime, or continuing to maintain his innocence, which means that he will be hanged. A French film, ""Les Sorcieres de Salem"", was based upon Miller's play in the fifties, but he had to wait another four decades before Hollywood plucked up the courage to follow suit. Miller himself wrote the screenplay, and Proctor is played by his son-in-law Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis is one of the most reliable screen actors in the world today; I have never seen him give a bad performance, and seldom one which is less than compelling. He is also a versatile actor who has created a gallery of memorable characters all quite different from one another, unlike some actors who play essentially the same character in every film they make. Although he is British and Irish by descent, many of his best-known characters, from Hawkeye in ""The Last of the Mohicans"" to President Lincoln, have been American, and Proctor is another. Day-Lewis makes him both proud and sensuous, but a man of integrity who will fight to retain that integrity, even at the cost of his life, in a world gone mad.The modern play closest in theme to ""The Crucible"" is, in my view, Robert Bolt's ""A Man for All Seasons"", also inspired by real historical events and with a hero who would rather forfeit his life than tell a lie. It is therefore appropriate that Paul Scofield, who famously played Thomas More in the stage and screen versions of ""A Man for All Seasons"", should also star in ""The Crucible"". Here he also plays a lawyer named Thomas, but a villain rather than the hero. Judge Thomas Danforth, Proctor's nemesis and the man tasked with investigating the allegations of witchcraft, is a cold, precise, bloodless figure, the sort of lawyer who is less concerned to see justice done than to see that if injustice is done it is done according to the strict letter of the law. A third fine performance comes from Winona Ryder as the spiteful, hysterical and vindictive Abigail, reminding us of just what a fine young actress she could be at her best, even if in recent years her emotionally troubled private life has received more attention than her acting. There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Lawrence as Rebecca Nurse, an old woman who maintains her dignity despite the absurd charges that are brought against her, and Rob Campbell as John Hale, a clergyman who initially supports the witch-hunt but who has enough integrity to change his mind to when he realises that the campaign has got out of hand and become an opportunity to settle old scores. The film was directed by Nicholas Hytner, also responsible for another successful historical drama of the mid-nineties, ""The Madness of King George"". ""The Crucible"" is not, however, made in the lavish ""heritage cinema"" style. In keeping with the Puritan aesthetic of the early Salem settlers and with the dark events which constitute its subject-matter, the look of the film is restrained and sombre. Hytner has produced a fitting adaptation of this great play. 8/10",The Crucible

13,sddavis63,Sobering And Chaotic - In Keeping With The Subject Matter,7,10 April 2011,"Arthur Miller wrote the play on which this movie was based in 1953. 1953 in the United States was the height of the Red Scare, with McCarthy and Nixon among others seeking to hunt down and destroy Communists - often with little or conflicting evidence, and often to the ruin of those accused on such flimsy evidence. Miller couldn't write a play depicting the abuses of the Communist witch-hunt, so he did the next best thing - he wrote a play based on the incident in American history that might be the closest thing to the Communist witch-hunts: the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, in which rumours led to suspicions, and personal jealousies and ambitions led to accusations and people lied about their neighbours and friends in order to deflect attention away from themselves and innocent people were forced to confess to witchcraft because if they denied it (no matter their innocence) they'd hang and the courts became less interested in discovering the truth than in rooting out the evil. It's actually quite a good parallel.This 1996 movie is based on Miller's play, and the screenplay for it was written by Miller himself. It's a sometimes chaotic movie - quite in keeping with the subject matter (either the official subject matter of the 1690's or the unofficial subject matter of the 1950's) - but in its chaos one picks up the basic point of how easily otherwise good people with normally good intentions can get caught up in evil ways. The devil may well have been on the prowl in Salem in 1692 - not through the accused but rather through their accusers and the system that encouraged and empowered the accusers.Generally speaking the performances here were pretty solid. Both Daniel Day-Lewis (as John Proctor) and Winona Ryder (as Abigail Williams) carried themselves well and the supporting cast was strong. The portrayal of life in a 17th century Puritan community is a little bit difficult to relate to, and even the Puritan manner of referring to virtually all married women as ""Goody"" (short for ""Goodwife"") grates for a while and sometimes creates confusion for the viewer in trying to keep the characters straight, because it's so unusual to modern ears - although, on the other hand, it does provide an air of authenticity to the movie. One can only be grateful that the Witch Hunt ended fairly quickly (although a good number of people were executed.) The Communist witch hunt lasted unfortunately longer with a greater number of people being scarred for life by the experience (and, indeed, some losing their lives as a result of it.) One would like to think that we've progressed over the years, although the demonization of Moslems since 9/11 - although is hasn't perhaps reached the depths of 1692 or the 1950's - suggests that the possibilities for such excesses are still present with us.

14,sol-kay,Mister Parris! You are a brainless man!,8,31 May 2008,"(There are Spoilers) When Puritan Reverend Parris, Bruce Davidson, of the little village of Salam Massachusetts saw his niece Abigail Williams, Winona Ryder, and her friends acting weird and dancing naked in the woods outside of town he immediately suspected them of being in league with Lucifer or the Devil.Made to confess their crimes the girls accuse Barbadian slave Tituba, Charlayne Woodard, of orchestrating the whole event. Tituba tortured into confessing that she's in fact a witch has Abigail and the girls follow suite. Admitting their guilt and in order to save their lives, from being executed, the girls make a deal with the village elders to ""out"" all their fellow witches. Thus not only saving their lives from the hangman's noose but their souls from eternal damnation.All this hysteria leads to neighbor accusing neighbor of practicing witchcraft in order to get their property as well as settle past scores or grievances with them. Abigail the leader of the girls in accusing anyone whom their at odds with of practicing witchcraft has had the hots for Farmer John Proctor, Daniel-Day Lewis, since she worked as a servant at the Proctor Farm.Having gotten a little too friendly with Farmer John his old lady Elizabeth, Joan Allen, had her dismissed suspecting that Abigail was having an affair with her strong and handsome husband. With Abigail now riding high in Salem in her exposing the evil that dwells there among the townspeople she turns her sights on Elizabeth in order to get even in what she did to her.The film accurately covers the infamous Salem Witch trials of 1692 that lead to 23 of those convicted of those crimes, witchcraft, to be either hanged suffocated to death as well as die in prison. Farmer John himself ended up at the end of a rope for refusing to admit he was a witch in order to save his life. Accepting death instead of dishonor John Proctor would later become the shining light and biggest hero of this dark period in Colonial American history.As for the self-righteous, as well as neurotic and confused, Abigail Williams she took off with the Reverend Parris church money like a thief in the night never, at least in the movie, to be heard from or seen again.The film based on Arthur Miller's 1953 play ""The Crucible"" is really about the Communist witch hunts of the late 1940's and early 1950's conducted by the HUAC-The House on Unamerican Activities Committee-of the US entertainment and literary industries. These hearings or witch hunts destroyed thousands of lives of innocent people who were either forced to admit their past Communist affiliations or names names of those who were associated, in their Communist ideas, with them. Thousands of people accused of having Communist sympathies during the 1930's and throughout WWII, when the Communist Soviet Union was our biggest ally against Nazi Germany, ended up not only losing their high paying jobs, in the entertainment as well as the world of academia, but their lives as well. Many of the accused committed suicide or ended up dying from the stress of being hounded by what the HUAC imposed on them in their having to out their friends as well as family members of either being Communists or having Communist sympathies.P.S One of those driven to their death by the constant hounding of the HUAC was actor John Garfield. Garfield died of a massive heart-attack on May 21, 1952 the very day he was to testify against his wife before the HUAC if he didn't want to end up being blacklisted by his bosses in Hollywood. The stress of facing his HURC inquisitors was far greater for tough guy and anti-hero actor John Garfield then anything or any villain he had to face on the silver or small, TV, screen.",The Crucible
15,paul2001sw-1,Less interesting than the events that inspired it,5,25 February 2006,"After the end of world war two, America had a justified fear of the Soviet Union: this fear turned into a raging paranoia, stoked by politicians like Joeseph McCarthy, who drove suspected communists from public life through a brilliantly self-propagating mechanism: those accused could save themselves only through denouncing others. That this episode is widely known today as a ""witch hunt"" is largely thanks to 'The Crucible', a play written by Arthur Miller who parallelled contemporary events to another black chapter in American history: the literal witch-hunt that took place in Salem, Massachusets, over 300 years before. As it's name suggests, 'The Crucible' examines the effects of persecution on a community forced to turn against itself (as, in general, was the American ""left""); and ultimately counsels defiance in the face of the enemy; but it's not actually that interested in why such things should happen, only that they should be resisted. And to me, this leads to certain weaknesses in the play. Whereas McCarthy caused misery for many according to a very deliberate agenda, and stoked his power doing so before a third party (the American public), in this story the original cause of the persecution comes from within the community of the persecuted (the spiteful jealousy of a rejected woman); and there is no external audience for whose benefit the show is staged. The merging of the three parties (persecutor, persecutors and witnesses) into a single community leads to certain obfuscation of motive. History may unfold by design or accident, and persecutions launched for a variety of reasons (honest but mistaken judgement; fraudulent opportunism; the fear of defying or abandoning a position of power); yet 'The Crucible' never really seems to nail its colours to the mast as to why the events it depicts unfolded. Similarly, the extent to which the community believes in witchcraft as a phenomenon (indepedently of whether they believe the accused are guilty) is unexplored, although surely this is crucial to the story. Also, in 'The Crucible', the paranoia (at its most intense) predates the persecutions. And while it's not so strange that the story concentrates on a single man who finds himself caught up in the drama, it is strange that everyone else in the play seems also to consider this one man more important than the others who die around him; and also disappointing that the play suggests that the persecuted are generally nobler humans than those who persecute them in all respects, not just the point at issue, which would be nice if true.Judged as a film, the most obvious comment on can make is that it's very heavy on dialogue; there's hardly a silent moment until close to the end, and when silence comes, it's moving. But as a whole, it's a simple parable; if you read Ariel Dorfman's book 'Widows', you'll be exposed to a far subtler (and ultimately more terrifying) story of how we (as a species) can come to wilfully harm those we know to be innocent.",The Crucible
16,cricketbat,"Not a horror film, but still horrifying",8,14 October 2019,"The Crucible is a horrifying film, not because of any witchcraft or devil worship, but because it portrays the terrifying idea that the innocent can be falsely accused, and a group of deceitful people, if united, can create whatever truth they want. The filmmakers have done a good job of bringing Arthur Miller's play to the big screen, and the performances, while occasionally melodramatic, give the movie a sense of realism. The Crucible was relevant in the days of McCarthyism and it still feels pertinent today.",The Crucible
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,6,25 October 2013,"The Crucible Without the witch trials, Salem wouldn't be able to exploit the hanging of innocent citizens for profit.But as this drama depicts, they happened, so fridge magnets are perfectly respectful.In 1692, the single women of Salem assemble in the forest and cast love spells on their crushes.One such witch is Abigail (Winona Ryder), a former nanny to Elizabeth Proctor (Joan Allen), whose unfaithful husband John (Daniel Day-Lewis) now bares the brand of her blood-bound enchantment.Later, the girls are accused of witchery. But Abigail convinces them to feign possession, brought upon them by townsfolk who practice the dark arts.The accused, including Goody Proctor, are then tried for sorcery.Based on Arthur Miller's prominent play, this well-acted, all-star adaptation adheres to historical accuracy amid an adulterous love triangle that tests one man's newfound fidelity.As for avoiding the gallows, just get a witch doctor to declare you insane.Yellow Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",The Crucible

It doesn't, and this movie is a key example of that. The writing is top notch, and the story and dialog show how hysteria and revenge may have been major factors in the incidents leading up to the Salem Witch Trails.The primary roles are extremely well acted. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as the resident who ultimately gives up his life rather than be cowed by the judges. Winona Ryder...well...difficult to like her character, and I felt that sometimes she was overacting...but overall effective. Paul Scofield excellent as the head judge. Joan Allen good as Day-Lewis' wife, but she's been better in other films. Bruce Davison genuinely unlikable as the local reverend who acts simply to save his position. Rob Campbell, an actor with whom I am not familiar, was quite good as another reverend.There's no question that some will not like this film. It moves slowly, but surely through the plot. The cinematography is well done in the spartan settings. I would class this as a niche film -- the niche here being viewers that like a more realistic view of history through film. I enjoyed the film, but to be honest, I doubt that I will watch it a second time.",The Crucible
19,ironhorse_iv,Wicked movie,7,21 November 2012,"The settling is 17th Century Salem, Massachusetts. A group of spoil teenage girls fearing in getting in trouble for meeting in the woods at midnight for a secret love-conjuring ceremony where the town minister mistook it as witchcraft. Instead of love, psychopath Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) wishes for the death of her former lover's John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis) wife. The girls are accused of witchcraft, but to save themselves they accused others. Soon the entire village is consumed by hysteria, and innocent victims are put on trial, leading to a accusations flying, judgments are pronounced, and sentences are quickly and ruthlessly carried out. The only person whom can save them is Mary Warren (Karron Graves). The Crucible isn't a pretty film, but Nicholas Hytner's grim movie version of the classic Arthur Miller concerning the Salem witch hunts is a tragedy and in some what could be also be called a horror/thriller movie. It explodes into a melodramatic but never less than gripping story between both John Proctor Vs Abigail Williams. Ryder is wicked insidious, as the angry, hysterical Abigail, caught up in a conspiracy of lies from which there's no escape looking for revenge against him. Daniel Day-Lewis gives us a stubborn yet vulnerable John Proctor. He gives one of the best lines in the film toward the end. Joan Allen delivers a heart-breaking performance as the anguished Elizabeth, a fervently religious woman unable to disprove the allegations made against her and her husband.it's pretty evident (if you read the book) that Elizabeth did forgive John Proctor. if she hadn't, she wouldn't have blamed herself partly for the affair. their relationship is very complex, but in the end she does forgive him. this draws on one of Miller's main themes of forgiveness. This story really shows how far people will go in their words and actions when they are motivated by blind fear. The Crucible was written as a thinly disguised attack on the McCarthy anti-communist Red Scare ""witch hunts"" of the 1950s America.!

20,didi-5,fine adaptation of arguably Miller's best play,9,16 October 2003,"My first acquaintance with 'The Crucible' was as a stage play in an excellent production which used large sets, mime, and heavy focus on the parallels between the Salem witchhunts and the persecution of Jews and Communists throughout the mid-20th century.Nicholas Hytner's movie opens out the play, uses an excellent range of locations, assembles a stellar cast (including Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen, both of whom are impressive in this, with Paul Scofield full of menace as their persecutor) and remains true to the source play.  My only reservation is the casting of Winona Ryder as Abigail, but that may be just personal taste.  I don't feel she is right for the role somehow.This movie shows intelligent, perceptive, and engrossing movie-making at its best.  I'd certainly say it represents one of the best films of the 1990s.",The Crucible
21,zkonedog,The Magic Of Arthur Miller,9,28 February 2017,"Sometimes, movies that are designated as ""classic"" suffer from a strange sort of reverse- discrimination. That's probably the reason why it took me so long to actually see this version of ""The Crucible"", as I thought of it as ""old"" or ""not exciting enough"". What I quickly discovered, however, is that Arthur Miller's tale here is truly one for the ages. It's a shame I waited this long to see it!For a basic plot summary, ""The Crucible"" is a story set during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) and a number of her teenaged female friends are screwing around in the woods one night (typical teenage rebellion kind of stuff) when they are discovered and charged as witches. What Abigail and the gang quickly discover is that in front of Judge Danforth (Paul Scofield), ""acting the part"" of witches gives them a great deal of attention and power. Things get ugly fast and pretty soon the entire community is in an uproar over who may or may not be a witch. Enter John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen), a common sense-driven couple who seemingly have the best chance to put an end to this madness. Yet, with John having a shady history with Abigail, they all ended up sucked into the lies and deceit, forcing difficult choices to be made regarding character and honesty.Not being as much of a theater enthusiast as I am of film/TV, this was just the second Arthur Miller work that I had seen (""Death of a Salesman"" with Dustin Hoffman being the first). That playwright has an incredibly keen sense of universal human themes and how to manipulate them to create high drama. Though ""Crucible"" is set hundreds of years ago, I can confidently say that it will endure (in some form or another) for hundreds of years more. The characters, emotions, and plots feel like they could happen today or tomorrow. This film touches on such common, deep-seated issues as:-The power of religion (both good and bad) -The effect of mass hysteria on an uneducated community -The propensity of one lie to be followed by more -The lengths humans will go (or the shortcuts we may take) to preserve our names and honor -The conflicting romantic notions of both teenagers and adultsSo, despite carrying a reputation that can get a little ""weighty"", ""The Crucible"" is really quite a simple film, concocting a plausible scenario and then letting human nature take its course. I recently saw the film ""The Witch"", a movie that shares much in theme with this earlier effort, and feel that the two measure up to each other quite well. If you enjoyed one, I think you will feel the same for the other.Overall, I was blown away by the simple, yet spectacular, quality of the writing and acting in ""The Crucible"". It will stimulate a lot of deep thought on the part of the viewer without getting overly complex or confusing. I think that there will be more Arthur Miller stories in my future!",The Crucible

23,PWNYCNY,Where's the exorcist when you need one?,6,17 June 2011,"The problem with this movie is not the subject matter but how the subject matter is treated. This movie takes a tragic event in American history, perhaps one of history's most egregious and infamous miscarriages of justice, and reduces it to a melodrama. Yet there is little in this event that lends itself to melodramatics; the tragedy is too all-encompassing and overwhelming. The melodramatics are added for literary purposes. The political motivation behind the trials is so obvious that the conduct of the judges become completely transparent. In this movie there was no way that the judges were going to leave Salem without convicting somebody of something, no matter how flimsy the evidence. If the judges had actually witnessed evidence of witchcraft, then their behavior would have been plausible, which brings us to the movie's fundamental flaw - that it fails to convey the depth of the community's belief in the existence of witches. In the movie, their belief comes off as a pretense, that deep down nobody seriously really believed in the existence of witches. Moreover, the behavior of the girls was not nearly bizarre enough for anyone to reasonably believe that they were possessed. For instance, if people had witnessed the girls suspending themselves in midair or speaking dead languages or turning their heads 360 degrees like Regan did in The Excorcist, then they might have had cause to conclude that something was amiss. But to ask the audience to believe that anyone, especially the magistrates, would accept flighty, hysterical behavior as evidence of witchcraft borders is ridiculous. The scene in which the girls rush out of the courthouse and into the ocean is laughable. The dialog between Daniel Day-Lewis and Wynona Ryder is forced and stodgy. There is absolutely no chemistry between them. Indeed, the John Proctor character is so vacillating that one must ask why the magistrates would want to waste their time with him in the first place. Also, the quality of the acting is uneven. Sometimes it is cheesy; other times it's strong. The same can be said for the level of drama; some scenes are intense, others flat. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because it is about a tragic event in American history that should be studied and discussed.",The Crucible
24,dee.reid,"Not just a dynamic character study, but a study of madness. **** (out of four)",10,25 October 2002,"For my eleventh grade English class, I have just finished reading ""The Crucible"" and have also finished watching the movie adaptation.  ""The Crucible"" which was written by Arthur Miller, is a shocking look into the events of a tragic period early in history that America will not likely forget.  The setting of ""The Crucible"" is that it takes place in the Puritan community of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692.  The story revolves around the hysteria caused by the Salem Witch Trials.  John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis), the story's protagonist (or should I say antagonist?), is facing a little bit of a moral dilemma.  It turns out that Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder), Proctor's former servant girl and mistress, along with several other young girls, were caught out in the woods dancing.  Apparently, from the evidence, Witchcraft was taking place.  John's wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen), is suffering because of his lechery, but deep down thinks that she may be partially responsible.  Reverend Parris (Bruce Davison) calls for Reverend Hale (Rob Campbell), a renowned pastor (and self-proclaimed paranormal expert) to come to Salem to investigate the accusations.John Proctor is sort of an innocent in this story.  In the beginning of the play, we see that he is deeply haunted by the affair, but he keeps his head up about it.  He is powerful of body, even-tempered and not easily led or quick to jump to conclusions.  He changes significantly because he begins to lower his self-esteem, especially after he looses control over his current servant girl, Mary Warren.  His change furthers because he later admits his sins, which leads to his inevitable imprisonment.  While in prison, he learns that his wife has become pregnant, and therefore she will not be hanged.  In the end, John is hanged after signing a confession and then ripping it up when he learns that it was to be nailed onto the church door. However, he did not die in bad spirits because he had accepted the fact that he was not coming out of this situation alive but his name would go untarnished.  Proctor pleas before his execution, ""Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life!  Because I lie and sign myself to lies!  Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang!  How may I live without my name?  I have given you my soul; leave me my name!"" 	Elizabeth Proctor is sort of an innocent too.  At the very start of the play, we see that she is a rather soft-spoken person, even with her past grievances.  As well, she is an honest person who always tells the truth and never lies.  She changes, however, when Abigail Williams brings charges of Witchcraft up against her.  Her physical change starts when she discovers that she is pregnant.  By the end of the play, she forgives John for his lechery.  She states, ""He have his goodness now.  God forbid I take it from him!""  This simply goes to show that she truly loved him in the end. 	Lastly, there is Reverend Hale.  At the beginning of the play, we see that he is a very confident man.  He seems to consider himself an expert in the field of Witchcraft and goes about promoting that image with the aid of his countless books.  The books, he thinks will solve all of the problems facing Salem.  When Reverend Parris makes a comment about how heavy his books are, Hale simply replies, ""They must be; they are weighted with authority.""  This goes to show that he puts too much faith into his books and not enough into common sense.  His emotional change begins when the good and well-respected people of the Salem community start being accused of Witchcraft, like when Abigail Williams charges Elizabeth Proctor as being a witch.   By the end of the play, he discovers that all of the accusations were in fact a hoax, orchestrated by Abigail Williams who shortly before the end of the trials, mysteriously disappears along with Mercy Lewis.  He feels deep regret and extreme guilt for not trying to stop the madness sooner.  He is also begging John Proctor to save his life, regardless of the possible aftermath in which his name is going to be corrupted.In many ways, the story of ""The Crucible"" may not just be a dynamic character study, but it is also a study of the madness that can stem from superstition and fear.  It simply amazes me that one little girl was able to use fear and superstition as a means of getting what she wanted.  The madness that had been created by the Salem Witch Trials was not just the result of people's greed, but jealousy and all-out hatred for one another. And you must remember that this is coming from a religious community that had come to this country to escape hatred, though it was not the same type as it was the reason for them leaving Europe.  For many bizarre reasons, ""The Crucible"" has also been the unfortunate target of misguided criticism.  These criticisms, I feel, are the unfortunate result of the Joseph McCarthy era.  In 1950, McCarthy who was a senator from Wisconsin had engaged on a ""Red Hunt"", which to him, was a hunt for suspected Communist Party members and spies inside the U.S. State Department.  Though this was relatively early in the Cold War, he had played on Americans already stemming fears of the Soviet Union in order to help rally people to flesh out the suspected persons.  Many of the people who were accused, lost their jobs and had extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere.  McCarthy, like many of the people during the Salem Witch Trials, had engaged on this hunt out of sheer hatred and jealousy of other people. And like when the Trials finally came to an end when the governor's wife had been accused of Witchcraft, McCarthy met his downfall in 1954, when he began attacking members of the United States Army.  The Army immediately took dislike to the accusations and struck back at McCarthy.  His power finally fell through when then President Dwight Eisenhower launched his own investigation into the accusations and found nothing.  McCarthy later died in 1957 of alcohol-related problems.  Do you see all of the parallels between the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 and the McCarthy era during the 1950s?  These are perfect examples of the horrible things that people are capable of doing to each other out of the pure hatred and the accusers will often succeed in doing this by playing on people's fears and local superstition.",The Crucible
25,drownnnsoda,Powerful Telling of the Salem Witch Trials.,8,3 November 2006,"I had to watch this film as a part of my high school literature class, since we had just finished reading Arthur Miller's classic play. I thought the play was great, definitely one of the best I've read (although I haven't read too many), and was wondering what the film would be like. And I was blown away. The film centers around John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen), who find themselves immersed in the hysteria the grips the colonial town of Salem, Massachussets, when rumors of witchcraft and Devil worshipping break out. This hysteria is set off after a group of girls are found dancing naked in the woods at night, and drinking the blood from a sacrificed animal, obviously dabbling in some sort of black magic. Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) is a cruel, deceitful young woman who is the main accuser in the witch hunt, although she herself was actually part of the ritual herself, and begins pointing out innocent person by innocent person, soon accusing Elizabeth and John as a revenge tactic for her failed affair with the man.Having read the play, I can easily say that this movie was very loyal to Miller's original work, which is a fictional account of the infamous Salem witch trials. Only a few minor changes were made here and there, but for the most part it was the same as the play. Aside from the wonderful story (that Miller wrote to reflect on the Communist blacklisting event in the 1950's), the acting is the real strong point. Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are both exceptional - they have great chemistry, and are both great actors. Winona Ryder plays the manipulative Abigail wonderfully, I can't really say anything bad about any of the acting. Aside from that, the sets and costumes display the time period (late 1600s America) beautifully, and the last scene of the film was just flat out depressing, as was the final conversation between John and Elizabeth. It really shows just how harsh and unreasonable the Puritan society was.Overall, ""The Crucible"" is an excellent adaptation of a play brought to the big screen. The acting, story, settings, costumes, and everything else made this such a powerful film. Honestly, I'm not sure they really could have done it better, Miller's play was definitely done justice.

26,gcd70,Forceful and Powerful,7,3 June 2008,"Powerful telling of Arthur Miller's revered play about the fearful witch hunt that took place in Salem, Massachussets in the late 17th century. Director Nicholas Hytner ensures the fanaticism and rabid superstition of the day is conveyed with force to the stunned audience, and I'm sure most will scarcely believe that a court of law could allow an accused person who pleads innocent to die, and one who confesses guilt (through threat of death) to live.Miller has painstakingly brought his play to the screen with care, not only to be true to the stage production, but also to fully develop his complex characters.The cast have done their level best to fulfill Miller's work, especially Winona Ryder who attempts to portray Abigail as something more than a vengeful harlot, though it's difficult to see her as anything else. Her performance is a strong one, but stronger still is Daniel Day-Lewis who again delivers the goods as John Proctor, the man who stands accused, along with his unfailing wife (a showing of passion and control from Joan Allen), of the terrible crime of consorting with the devil. The tremendous struggle he has with his very soul is most convincingly conveyed. Solid support comes from the craggy-faced Paul Scofield, a surprising Jeffrey Jones and perhaps even more surprising, George Gaynes (Commandant Lassard of ""Police Academy"" fame). Smaller, though quite impressive standouts come from Bruce Davison as the floundering Reverend Parris and Rob Campbell as the rather more enlightened, and much more practical, Reverend Hale. Robust acting makes this film a thoroughly enjoyable one.George Fenton's music is most appropriate, editing is precise and art direction simple yet telling.Wednesday, February 26, 1997 - Village Rivoli",The Crucible

I really thought it was very well done although if one does not have at least a slight interest in the events in Salem they may not like this because it is genuinely disturbing.There isn't a lot I can comment on regarding the historical accuracies. I'm aware that some things were changed and have no problem with that. What is fascinating to me is the look back in time and just how the movie was able to capture the atmosphere. In my opinion the movie was excellent not just at it's atmosphere but also in capturing the humanness of the wrongly accused, the hopelessness and horror of these events. This is a tremendously disturbing film to watch, in part because it is based on real events so one kind of knows how the film will end and all through, it's easy to find yourself hoping the movie will have a different ending even though logically you know it cannot.The performers were all excellent and one did not impress me more then another necessarily as all were great. The location shooting was effective and though the manner of speaking was different back then, it's amazing how natural that feels in this film.I can't say this is a fun movie but it is a very very good film and upsetting. The film touches on themes such as honor and nobility. The film includes a blurb at the end about how more and more people accused in Salem refused to make false confessions or accuse others. The story is heartbreaking, fascinating, and one will be thinking of it, and that time period after it ends. This movie will have you doing so many ""whatifs"" on how the events put into motion, could have been stopped.

31,jpschapira,A crucified example...,5,1 September 2006,"The late Arthur Miller wrote lots of things; among them a play called ""The Crucible"". On 1996, Nicholas Hynter directed the first American cinematographic version of Miller's play, and Miller himself ended up writing the screenplay of the film. The story unfolds in Salem, where the teenage girls are going crazy about witchery in some people.I've seen many films that take place in old time and have characters which give a lot of importance to God and the religion; ""The Crucible"" is like that and that's the only reason the movie lasts longer than it should, because it's obvious for the viewers that the teenagers are pretending every part of their act, but judge Danforth (Paul Scofield), Reverend Parris (Bruce Davison) and Reverend Hale (Rob Campbell) are very confident in the fact that it could be true.The teenage girls are led to their actions by Abigail Williams, played by Winona Ryder in one of those performances full of strength and moving power during a time where the world was hers and she could act alongside Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen without seeming out of place. She starts with these witchery accusations because she had an affair wit John Proctor (Day-Lewis) and wants his wife Elizabeth (Allen) in jail.Ryder's character is a kid; a teenager in love who makes choices and says things always in the verge of despair; without thinking. So here the performances appear in order of growth. Ryder, with her desperation; Day-Lewis, who seems so dramatic but at the same time so real in the acceptance of the mistake he has made; and Allen, whose look is full of sadness and incomprehension of the role she has ended up playing.The rest of the cast shares the sense of drama of their partners, especially Bruce Davison, who is shouting all the time and making absurd accusations; or Rob Campbell, who suspects he might be living a lie and starts going crazy in front of people. The film's major achievement in my opinion lies in the technical work, without underestimating the work of the cast.Therefore the picture sustains its two hours because of the solid portrayals the actors do; because of the cinematography and the production design which make the film look a lot older than the time it was made in; and because of the peculiar editing that my brother disliked but gives a darker tone to the creepy environment presented.Arthur Miller has no fault in what happened, because it could be a slow and tedious screenplay that betrayed the film; but it isn't. I've seen lots of good films with slow screenplays and even more plays with tedious ones. ""The Crucible"" must be a very entertaining ride on a theater stage, but it's just that not every successful play turned into a film will be successful too; and here you have an example.",The Crucible
32,gelman@attglobal.net,A Remarkable Adaption of Arthur Miller's Great Play,10,12 July 2009,"I'm not sure how I missed the film the first time around. Don't know what I was doing at the time. I knew the play, of course. Anyone who had experienced the McCarthy Era knew very well that Arthur Miller's drama was about McCarthyism as refracted through the prism of the Salem witch trials of the late 17th Century. Perhaps because many of us were traumatized by what was happening in our own time, ""The Crucible"" resonated powerfully when it first appeared. We considered it one of Miller's greatest artistic achievements. So I surely would have gone to see the movie if I'd been paying attention. Now, some 13 years after it first appeared, my wife and I watched the film for the first time. With the proscenium gone and a mass of extras representing the residents of Salem, the movie is quite different from the play in important respects. But Miller himself wrote the screen play, so the thrust and spirit of the original is fully intact, and the acting in the principal roles -- by Joan Allen, Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder and Paul Scofield (in alphabetical order) -- could scarcely be improved. In fact, everything in the movie is exceptionally well done: direction, photography, costuming, set design, lighting. Probably because the McCarthy Era was long gone -- and younger Americans may find it difficult to believe it could have divided the nation and terrified millions as it did -- the film may have come across as an historical drama without contemporary relevance. That's understandable but to anyone moved by the original play or to anyone who actively remembers the McCarthy Era, ""The Crucible"" is not simply an historical curiosity. It is a terrifying reminder of an impulse toward madness that can destroy reputations, snuff out the lives of innocent people and wreck a community or a nation. That impulse, unfortunately, can be manifested at any time and in any place under the wrong set of circumstances. The 20th Century was full of examples and the impulse, in ever-changing shapes, remains unchecked in the 21st Century. Look at ""The Crucible"" and see the perversion not just of Puritan New England but of human self-righteousness in its most vindictive form.",The Crucible
33,jdkraus,A whore's vengeance served well...,8,13 April 2007,"After just reading the play by Arthur Miller, I felt moved by its gripping story. When seeing the movie, I have to ""confess"" that I liked the film more than the play. Comparing the movie with the play in accuracy is quite close, almost exact. Not only did bring the film to life on picture, but also added and grew more in-depth in the thin layer of witch-hunting, but the hardcore of fraud and vengeance.""The Crucible"" is about the Salem witch trials back in the late 1600s of where mass hysteria erupted from a small number of girls who claim they were bewitched by other members in the town, which led to the deaths of twenty people. There is no proof or real evidence as to why the girls acted, and made wide accusations so pervasively and heartlessly. But the play, even more so with the movie reveals the dark side of the brutal truth.Abigail Williams (Winona Rider) and a handful of other girls were caught dancing and supposedly committing ""sacrifices"" and other demonic rituals. After each being persistently and mercilessly interrogated, the girls, (with Abigail as the leader), start saying other people's names in order to evade their troubles. Here on, paranoia and disillusion develops as the girls grow bewitched, in which the townsfolk believe in. Basically, they put on a ""class act"", manipulating the court system not only to get out of harsh punishments or gain their fame, but to seek vengeance upon those in the town that harmed and/or despised them.""You listen upon a whore! God is dead!"" shouts a condemned Procter, instantly giving the message of the tale. In the end, the Innocent die, and those who try to speak the truth of the hoax also die. The film shows well of man's ignorance to reason, as well as inhumanity to their fellow neighbor. But even more so, the real moral is when vengeance and greed clouds the minds of those who lived. In the end, the politics and the manipulative girls are the winners. The performances were outstanding. Winona Rider, even though I don't fancy her much, gave a very manipulative and cunning performance that I haven't seen since Meiko Harado as Lady Kaede in Kurosawa's Ran. Abigail does it all to seek the heart of a married man John Procter (Daniel-Day Lewis). Once again, Mr. Lewis gives a compelling and heart-wrenching performance as Procter, who would do anything to find the truth and save the town, as well as his friends, from destruction and madness. There were many other faces that were great, including: Eric Schofield, Joan Allen, Bruce Davison, and Rob Campbell.Apart from the great acting and solid story, the film also held good film-making quality, such as: the mellow dramatic score, the proper setting (including costume, being filmed on the actual location, and the set-decoration). However, the actual directing was weak. Instead of having up-close shots like Peter Jackson, wide-ranged, distant shots like Kurosawa, or even a hand-held or shaky camera movement like Paul Greengrass, the camera was stiff. It was as if the director only wanted to show the story in an audience perspective, not trying to pull the audience into it. Added to this, the pace for the two hour film dragged a bit.But do not be disheartened by these flaws, for ""The Crucible"" is a great film based off of a great and unforgettable/unforgivable story of lies, deceit, paranoia, disillusion, and death. 4/5 ""You covet what you see""-Hannibal Lector",The Crucible
34,DarthVoorhees,A triumph!,10,23 October 2006,"The classic Arthur Miller play is given new life as it is brought to the screen. The Crucible is a nearly flawless movie. Daniel Day-Lewis gives easily the best performance of his career and has made the role of John Proctor his own(Hard to do considering how many people have played the role on stage) Miller has extended his scenes to the point where we don't even realize he's added new parts(And I have read The Crucible countless times) Nicholas Hytner gives a Spielberg/Coppola caliber direction job here, which is really hard to do because the material is so iconic yet Hynter is still able to make this film his own.The one flaw of the film is Winona Ryder who just can't keep up with her supporting cast. Not to say she is horrible, but really someone else need to take the pivotal role of Abagail Williams. You know you have done something wrong with casting when your Mary Warren is more charismatic than Abagail.The big surprise of the movie though is Rob Campbell as John Hale. He gives a great performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination in my opinion. We all most wish Miller had given more to Hale to say.The Crucible is a classic film and I recommend it to you not just as a fan of the original work but as a fan of film all together. In a decade full of great films The Crucible was sadly forgotten but it is a must rent film. I consider it to be one of the best of the 90's.",The Crucible
35,Christian_Dimartino,One of the saddest and most powerful films you'll ever see.,10,4 September 2010,"Daniel Day Lewis is John Proctor in the powerful underrated film, The Crucible. The crucible deserved more awards notice than it received, because it's easily one of the greatest movies ever made. Without a doubt.During the 1700's, The film opens with a bunch of women performing witch craft in the morning outside of a village. When a priest(played by Bruce Davidson) witnesses it and finds out that his daughter and niece were involved in the ritual.The next morning, his daughter won't wake up. And him and the others blame it on witch craft. And everything falls apart when his niece Abby(played excellently by Winona Ryder, who is a ""Diet cokehead"", as her character Veronica in ""Heathers"" once said) and the rest of the women who performed the ritual start to blame other people for it. And the judges go along with it because of the land, and hang everyone who won't confess to witch craft.Abby used to work for John Proctor(Daniel Day Lewis). But the two of them had an affair, so his wife(played fantastically by Joan Allen) fired her. Abby accuses his wife of being a witch, and this causes heartbreak,betrayal,and tragedy.The Salem witch trials were unfair. Obviously. And what little known director Nicholas Hytner did with this film is stupendous. The acting from everyone in The Crucible is powerful. No matter what Daniel Day Lewis does it's a masterpiece. Winona Ryder is very evil. Joan Allen is always great too.The Crucible is heart wrenching and powerful. This is such a tragic story. Over twenty innocent people died do to the injustice of these women. Even a girl with cancer. The ending is very sad, but it's the right one. The Crucible is gripping, and if you haven't seen it, now is the time.4/4",The Crucible
36,Dan1863Sickles,"Once Considered Great Literature, Now Almost Unwatchable",3,20 November 2014,"A feverish performance by Wynona Ryder as Puritan temptress Abigail, plus a broodingly sexy turn by Daniel Day-Lewis as the wandering husband John Proctor, plus a dozen standout performances from a perfectly chosen supporting cast of all ages, all fall just short of bringing Arthur Miller's insistently simplistic anti-Black List anti-McCarthyite fable to life.Arthur Miller has no feeling for language, and no gift for characterization. What he does well is to create a story that makes audiences feel empowered because they can ""see through"" the characters. In the case of The Crucible, it's clear from the beginning that Abigail is just a slut, Elizabeth Proctor is a cold, humorless nag, and poor put-upon John Proctor is a ""decent"" man unjustly hated by women who expect him to value them for something other than the pleasures of the bed! Ironically, what comes across most strongly in Miller's version of the Salem witch trials is not the hysteria of the girls but Arthur Miller's sexual panic. The fanaticism of the Puritans is less extreme than his own loathing for women and girls. He's actually a much ""better"" Puritan than the Puritans he denounces. His hero seduces a teenage girl, ruins her virtue, then acts a martyr's part when she turns against him! John Proctor wants to have complete authority over the women in his life, wife, mistress and servant girl alike. Yet never once does he show the slightest regard for their feelings or the slightest respect for their intelligence.In particular, note how John Proctor systematically uses bullying and the threat of violence to force timid, weak-willed Mary Warren (a sensational turn by the sadly unappreciated Karron Graves) into testifying against Abigail in court. Not for one minute do you believe that John Proctor has any real concern about what happens to Mary. Once his wife is off the hook he's going to go right back to kicking, beating, and screwing his servant girls whenever the spirit moves him. But this is Arthur Miller's ""hero."" Oh, and check out his neo-Existentialist rambling when the chips are down. ""I f***ed a sixteen year old girl. Therefore, THERE IS NO GOD!"" You wish.And they wonder why kids in high school won't read.",The Crucible
37,roedyg,When Christians Ruled the World,8,10 November 2016,"This is like a science fiction movie, where everyone is moved by motives that make no sense. The actors speak in stilted period English but it is not that hard to understand.There is no defence against a charge of witchcraft. If you had an alibi you were nowhere near, that does not count, since your spirit could have done it. If the victim were surrounded by people, who saw nothing, then you did it by making yourself invisible. The victim just announces who did the witchcraft, even when they have no reason to suspect any particular culprit. The victims are never asked how they know X did it. They are never asked to show physical injury.You just accuse someone. That is all that is required to presume their guilt. The motives for accusing are petty jealousies, petty revenge, sadism, mischief, playfulness... With just a little acting and drama, you can kill off anyone you please. One horrible schemer of a girl accuses a married man's wife, and caps the deal by planting some evidence, hoping she can have her husband for herself.The young girls at Salem were far from innocent. They were vicious little bitches. They were calculating murderers. They did it primarily for fun. They seemed to get sexual pleasure from watching the hangings.Refusal to confess association with the devil is proof of guilt and leads to hanging. By ""confessing"" and implicating others you can get off with a punishment less than death. The villagers are torn between creating false confessions and sticking to the truth. Before calm returns, they have hanged 19 people, a substantial proportion of the village.Modern day Creationists remind me of this mad logic when they refuse any evidence to counter the validity of the bible or the validity of evolution.The characters all harbour insane ideas about the bible, witches and Christianity. The books about witchcraft, which are just fiction, are treated as the ultimate authority. Ditto for the bible. The villagers are nearly all evil, vicious, vindictive, suspicious, hateful bastards. It is hard to pay attention to anything else going on in the movie (a reconstruction of Salem village life) but those crazy spiteful beliefs.The court is no better, seeing the devil behind every tree, deciding ahead of time that everyone even indirectly mentioned is guilty.It is amazing we managed to grow out of this way of thinking.Paul Scofield as Judge Thomas Danforth plays a wonderful villain. He so authoritative in his own universe, but completely mad relative to ours. He is so utterly sure of his rightness.Winona Ryder as Abigail Williams also plays a great villain. She starts out innocently enough, as the jilted lover, but she is willing to kill off all her acquaintances in her mad scheme to get him back. She is infinitely self-centred, a real psychopath.The whole madness is so stressful, it makes saints of some people and petty monsters of others. It is interesting watching them change.",The Crucible
38,khatcher-2,excellent adaptation for the screen,7,20 April 2003,"There is nothing I like better than a good play for the stage, even when it is on screen. This is the second time I have been able to see this worthy conversion of Arthur Miller's classic play adapted to the screen. Nicholas Hytner certainly earnt his wages; and all the cast should have received a good pay-rise. Convincing scene-setting in Massachussets at the end of the 17th Century with heavy wood-framed farm buildings and typical North European immigrant peasants' clothing, all beautifully filmed. Arthur Miller himself collaborated on the script, allowing certain poetic licence in modernising some of the speech forms, which, in the original play  written around 1952-1953  reflected speech patterns of the times.I blow the dust off my 1973 Penguin copy of the play, and can follow some of the scenes almost verbatim. Thus the effect is dramaturgical rather than cinematographic, a little like Branaghan doing his versions of Shakespeare. A pleasing result indeed. Highly recommended for conoisseurs of fine acting in the classic sense. Neither of the two leading actors  Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder  will let you down.The Salem Witches have been the cause of a few forays by writers, historians and so on: really the whole affair seems to typicalize people's appetites for forming psychosis-like manias, often on the grounds of nothing very concrete. I mean to say, the devil exists in the minds of those who invent it; the same cause as the `reds under the beds' phobia of the 1960s and 1970s, today transformed into `Islam Terror' around every corner. The clothing is different, but the mentality producing the phobias is not.
`The Crucible' in this excellent adaptation make this poignantly clear. My vote is slightly higher than the present IMDb average.",The Crucible
39,RossRivero99,A pulse pounding period drama,9,28 October 2015,"If it weren't for me reading the script to Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" I never would have understood Nicholas Hytner's adaptation of the play quite as well as I did. The movie is historical fiction which talks about the 1692 Salem Witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts. The movie stars Daniel Day- Lewis as John Proctor a farmer and a seemingly kind gentleman in the beginning of the movie but I won't try to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie. Miller's play was both interesting and suspenseful but the movie didn't live up to the play as much, to me Daniel Day-Lewis is the essential John Proctor. The movie also other great cast members as well such as Joan Allen (in an Oscar nominated performance) as Porctor's wife Elizabeth, Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth, Winona Ryder as Abigail but to be honest I thought her performance was a little over the top, Bruce Davison as Rev. Samuel Parris, and so many more. Hytner's direction and Miller's Oscar nominated screenplay are well worth watching unfold this is up there with some of the best period films I have ever seen. Though it isn't a great movie it was a near-masterpiece in my view, and Daniel Day-Lewis gave one of the finest performances of his entire career in this movie. This is one of the best movies of 1996.",The Crucible

Lewis is an amazingly powerful actor, and he manages to slowly pull you into his tragedy and make you feel his pain and injustice.

41,dead47548,One of the finest plays in history is turned into a cinematic masterpiece.,10,18 October 2007,"One of the finest plays in history is remarkably turned into one of the finest masterpieces of the '90s. Arthur Miller's original story is one of power and the terrible nature of society on two fronts. First, it tackles the inner struggle of a morally strong man who's emotions get the better of him and the girl who will do anything to have him be her's forever. Secondly, it displays the flaws of the government and society in general, and how one person's claim can corrupt an entire town. It's a stunning take on the foolishness and utterly unbelievable nature of a topic that dates back to the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism and is even poignant today in terms of the War on Terror.The topic that interested me more was the first one I spoke of; a striking study of a moral man who's done a wrong and the pain he has to suffer because of it. John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a working man, who gets whatever he earns with his bare hands. His wife, Elizabeth (Joan Allen) is the standard working class wife. While John is in the field, she gets dinner ready and gets the house in order. Lingering over this seemingly perfect marriage is a secret that has isolated them from the rest of the community. John's affair with a former servant, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) has created a cold, emotionless relationship between the two but Elizabeth's devoted love for him means that they will stay isolated and no one will ever know of his sin which would surely lead to his hanging. Of course no man can endure this experience without suffering some severe inner pain and this slowly unfolds over Proctor throughout the course of the film.In the end, after turmoil between John and Elizabeth both trying to do the best thing for each other that has turned into the worst case scenario for both, Proctor's pain is unleashed in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in as long as I can remember. He agrees to proclaiming his life in the world of witchcraft in exchange for releasement from prison back to his wife and unborn child. But when they ask for his signature on the statement, and state that they will post it on the church wall, his years of torment and internal frustration explode as he pleads in a scene of gut-wrenching release as he begs for the jurors to leave him his name. This story is all highlighted by an absolutely brilliant and cathartically heartbreaking performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. He even upstages the commanding Queen Joan Allen (who also delivers a superb performance) in several scenes, and delivers one of the finest examples of acting genius I've ever had the privilege of experiencing.This entire relationship and painful release is experienced under the grand scheme of the Salem Witch Trials, an eye-opening display of how easily the government and society can be fooled and won over. Due to her love for John Proctor, Abigail Williams will do anything to take Elizabeth out of the picture. Even if this means bringing down all of Salem in the process. She starts claiming that everyone is a witch, along with her numerous friends who so easily follow her example, in order to avoid getting into trouble. When she realizes how brilliantly this works, and how everyone she claimed practiced witchcraft ended up in the gallows, that she could use it to end Elizabeth and live a happy life alone with John. Of course the folly of youth is there blind belief that everything will work according to plan, and she underestimates Proctor's love and devotion to his wife who he clearly shows he will go to the grave with. Abigail see's that no matter what she does, she won't get John back and flees Salem in the midst of night, never to be seen again (at least as far as the film/play is concerned). Winona's performance is also very strong and ranks high among the best of her career and of 1996.At the center of this entire story is how easy it is to sway society, shown through these Witch Trials. Arthur Miller originally wrote his play to comment on the foolishness of McCarthyism; the children representing McCarthy, the jurors obviously as the government and the false witches as the dozens of people that McCarthy accused of being a communist under no grounds that were put into prison for being completely innocent. These two incidents in American history show that the government lies down to the very core of their jural structure. The phrase 'Innocent until proved guilty' is one of the most abused in history and these historical accounts prove that we are and have always been much more about the reverse; guilty until proved innocent or, in terms of the Witch Trials, hanging unless you admit your guilt. Even now we see the flaws of the governmental structure as numerous people are being claimed to be terrorists and are put in prisons, though there is no concrete evidence of that which they are prosecuted for, just the false claims of a foolish society.",The Crucible
42,mOVIemAN56,An Incredible Film. Moving and Powerful,9,16 May 2005,"The Salem Witch Trials is something everyone around the world has heard, let alone the United States. The time was the late 16-th century and religion ruled the America's. The film is based of the classic Arthur Miller play, 'The Crucible' the film version does not disappoint.Salem is a quiet New England town along the Atlantic Ocean. It is home to a variety of sailors and farmers, but soon mischief would send the town into madness. After Reverend Parris (Bruce Davison) discovers the slave Tituba (Charlayne Woodard) conducting what is seen as witchcraft, the town begins to fall into panic and soon people are being accused left and right by a group of girls claiming to be able to see evil spirits and the black man enlisting lieutenants from the colony.Caught in the middle is John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis), a farmer who has broken off an affair with Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder), one of the girls accusing people. Now John's unfaithfulness to his wife will lead to his own condemnation and his quest to stop the killing through defiance. Soon the city would send itself into history by the hanging of twenty people including a feeble old man and a local drunk. The Saelm Witch Trials was truly a sad time for colonial people and resulted in the death of so many. Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible as John Proctor and continues to be a top actor in Hollywood. Winona Ryder is sinister in her role and goal for nothing but to have John Proctor. I now little of the trials but I think The Crucible shows how sad they were: especially the final scene when the crowd isn't cheering but solemn as John is led to his rope. the story is mostly true to Miller's play and is well portrayed in this film version.The Crucible.

43,glgioia,A Sad Swan Song,3,20 October 2008,"Arthur Miller is arguably the greatest American playwright of the last century. The Crucible, AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN, I had always looked upon as a modern masterpiece. It is therefore absolutely heartbreaking for me to watch this filmed variation of The Crucible that is such a complete and utter sell-out to the modern hot button Hollywood dreck. What is even more difficult to endure, is the knowledge that it is Arthur Miller himself who is responsible for peeing on his own work. There his vaunted name sits, the sole screen writing credit to a run of the mill if not worse than most, B movie adaptation. Yes, Yes, Mel Brooks has done this in reverse with The Producers and Young Frankenstein, and done it successfully. I know also that it is Mr. Miller's play and he can do with it whatever he chooses to, obviously. I just switched off this film (no I couldn't make it to the end) with a real sense of disappointment and a diminished assessment of Miller that bordered on disillusionment. I don't want to compare Arthur Miller to Mel Brooks but I think now I always will. To take the devils advocate approach, Miller wrote the original play to satirize McCarthyism; a topic in which most Americans today probably hold very little interest. So the lampoon HAD to be adapted to conform to the modern perceived injustices. Right? Well if this is true, then the original play for me and even more importantly for Arthur Miller, has minimal value as enduring art and as such, must be completely overrated if not, dismissed? Which brings me back to my disillusionment.",The Crucible

53,DaRick89,"The Crucible is a very good film - a near-perfect translation of Arthur Miller's classic play. As a movie, it is even better.",9,20 June 2007,"Arthur's play, The Crucible, was meant to denote, with some historical inaccuracy, the witch trials of Salem in 1692. However, Miller used the Salem witch trials as an allegory to the McCarthyism which pervaded throughout the United States during the 1950's. I'm sure the majority of the American IMDb users have a vague idea of what happened during that era, so I'll get to the movie. Anyway, the film adaption of the Crucible is indeed a faithful adaption of the play. Given the masterful nature of the play, this is obviously a compliment.The Salem witch hysteria, as documented in the film, first occurs when Reverend Samuel Parris (Bruce Davison) finds a group of girls dancing naked in the Salem forest. Parris is later led to believe that the girls were holding a séance with Tituba, the slave of Parris. This leads to mass hysteria and the resultant witch-hunt. John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis), a respected figure, finds that his wife Elizabeth (Joan Allen) has been accused of witchcraft. His involvement in the witch-hunt grows deeper when he finds that Abigail (Winona Ryder, future shoplifter), his former teenage lover, set Elizabeth up. I admit to not seeing the ending of the film, but I read the play, so I expect it will be similar.I don't often speak about the directing, since I don't know much about what makes a good director. However, Nicholas Hynter's direction is smooth, as is the cinematography, leading to the plot being fairly easy to follow. The costumes also appear to be appropriate to the era (1692). The plot is obviously competent, as it is an adaption of Miller's play, which is a well-constructed allegory. However, the transition to the film could've easily resulted in the implementation of some sickeningly saccharine scenes, particularly where Abigail and John interact. Thankfully, this doesn't occur.Adding to the effectiveness of this film is the fact that it arguably demonstrates how the boundaries of guilt and innocence are altered in a culture of fear, guilt and malice (which was prevalent in Salem). It also gives us insight as to how authority figures may act in these times of adversity. The events in Salem (and indeed McCarthyism) were also the result of an ideological conflict between the puritans and non-puritans (Salem was a puritan community), as the film amply demonstrates. This doesn't make the film perfect, however. The acting, while rarely being bad, is decidedly mixed. This is in regards to the correlation between each actor's portrayal of their character and the personality of the character within the play. In this regard, Ryder plays the addled 'whore' that is Abigail quite well. Joan Allen also portrays Elizabeth Proctor appropriately (as a sullen yet kindly woman). Paul Scofield portrays Danforth the way he should - as a cold-hearted human being. Jeffrey Jones also brings out the vindictive side of Thomas Putnam. However, Bruce Davison portrays Parris as too much of a tyrant, rather than the whimsical, petty church leader that Miller constructed him as. Similarly, Rob Campbell turns in a wooden performance as Reverend Hale. In my mind, he does not demonstrate enough of the hysteria that punctuated Hale's personality later on in the play. Peter Vaughan also can't help but make Giles Corey look more irritating than he actually is. Daniel Day-Lewis is, as far as I can remember, a mixed proposition as John Proctor. When he is meant to be hysterical, he pulls it off perfectly. However, in his interaction with Abigail and even Elizabeth to an extent, he occasionally seems wooden and unconvincing.Anyway, as an adaption of the film, The Crucible is near-perfect, with a few sub-par acting performances marring an otherwise spotless picture. As a movie, it is even better, as it also acts as a sociological study with some aplomb. I have no hesitation in rewarding The Crucible:4.5/5 stars",The Crucible
54,jjgooner,A Brilliant Adaption of Arthur Miller's Play,8,1 July 2013,"The Crucible**** (out of 4)124 mins/ 12Cast: Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, Joan Allen, Paul Scofield, Bruce Davison, Rob Campbell, Jeffrey Jones, Peter VaughanDirector: Nicholas HytnerPlot: Abigail Williams, a puritan teenager in the times of the Salem Witch-Trials, accuses her ex- lover's wife of compacting with the devil.JJ's Verdict: Based on a true story, The Crucible is a thrilling and emotional take on the Salem Witch-Hunt and the consequencing trials and hangings. Arthur Miller, adapting the story from his own play, received an Academy Award nomination. The film's hero is John Proctor, a sinful but respected farmer living in Salem, who comes into the story when his ex-lover accuses Proctor's wife of witchcraft. Of course, being set in the 17th century, the film gives a highly realistic look and view of the time. The American-British accents from the whole cast are fully complete as are their performances. Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays Proctor, once again completely transforms into his character (no doubt he lived in the conditions of the times and wore the clothes for months to prepare for his role.) His character has a certain charm, reluctancy and silent, brooding confidence – and all these attributes are superbly picked up Day- Lewis. Winona Ryder, playing Abigail, is just incredible in a ruthless and superbly dramatic performance. Her character really only starts with all her accusing to get back at John, and Ryder plays the spitefulness of her character very well. Paul Scofield is also good as Thomas Danforth, a judge, and Joan Allen is suitably dramatic in an Oscar nominated role as Proctor's struggling wife. Although the entire feature is emotionally driven, one scene really sticks out in my mind when looking back on this very underrated classic. This scene in which all the town's girls start to name people they saw with the devil is very dramatic. Forced into 'admitting' by Bruce Davison's Reverend Parris, all of the actresses let themselves go and just let the lines flow through their mouths. Similar scenes like this occur throughout the film and it is times like these when 'The Crucible' moves more towards a black comedy. However, the last half an hour is anything but. Emotionally depressing, it helps give the film an epic status. The beautiful cinematography and a deep score from George Fenton help to make the final few moments a good time to get the box of tissues out.All in all, a brilliant cast (which also includes Peter Vaughn, Rob Campbell and Jeffrey Jones) gives 'The Crucible' a super lift from a good historical drama, to an emotion filled mini-epic.",The Crucible
55,heywood100,Effective adaptation,8,24 April 2003,"Surprisingly this is the first ever big screen adaptation of Arthur Miller's play. Suprising because the script itself is so good that all you need are decent actors and so-so direction and you can't go wrong. And this has both. So it's good. So watch it.Although the play was originally written to show the madness of the McCarthy Communist witch hunts, in the current political climate it takes on a more contemporary meaning as Salem is enveloped in a web of lies and the pious religious leaders try to fight an invisible enemy on the grounds that it is 'God's will'. Particularly echoing of recent events are lines like ""you are either with this court or you are against it"" and ""the marks of the Devil are precise"". The Crucible is an incredible piece of drama that everyone should see at least once, so you may as well watch this version.",The Crucible
56,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 3 out of 5,6,3 December 2003,"The Crucible is gripping, yet it is also frightening and terrible in the inexorable march of its protagonists towards their doom.  The story is based on Arthur Miller's rendition of the infamous 1692 Salem witch trials.  In this Puritan town, a group of girls are caught dancing and love-spell casting in the woods.  To save themselves from being whipped, they claim it was the Devil's doing and furthermore that some of Salem's residents are compacted with Lucifer.  But private vengeance is also at work here.  The girls' ringleader, Abigail Williams (Winona Ryder) is obsessed with a local farmer (Daniel Day-Lewis) and will stop at nothing to get him for herself. Then the court investigating the claims of witchery begins to proscribe hanging for those who won't 'confess'. . . . . . . . ..It is unfortunate then, that a movie such as this is marred by several flaws.  While it vividly and unnervingly portrays the transformation of a community into warring factions, and ultimately the disintegration into mob-mentality and mass hysteria, it also seems very stagey.  You can almost see the notations in the film script - ""crowd murmurs in agreement"", and so on.  Additionally, Day-Lewis, and particularly Ryder, play the entire film at full volume.  Thus, several integral speeches get lost in the blast. However, there are some excellent performances from those in the court scenes - the steely remorselessness of Judge Danforth and the pompous and insidious questioning of Judge Hathorne.  Fortunately director Nicholas Hytner has moved as much of the action as possible out of doors, which is just as well, for Puritan dwellings are no great objects of beauty.However, despite its shortcomings and largely unadventurous cinematography, The Crucible is a film that will remain with the viewer long after its dramatic and memorable conclusion.  Even in death there is triumph and redemption.",The Crucible

59,blubb06,Impressive and haunting,10,19 April 2008,"A powerful, modern adaptation of Arthur Miller's play about the 17th century witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts, where 19 people were hanged for witchcraft and one tortured to death. Of course, Miller took artistic liberties with the truth: Most importantly, he freely invented a love story between the two main characters who were, in reality, 11 and 60 years old.Winona Ryder, Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen excel in their roles as points of a triangle of forbidden love, repression and spiritual purity  ultimately, what the title ""The Crucible"" is about: Do you sign away your soul, the honest truth and your reputation to save your life, sacrificing others? Day-Lewis' character could be a time traveler, unwillingly dragged into the Middle Ages, where superstition was rife and the devil very real. In that respect, we never left the Stone Age  we are, by our very nature, self-serving animals. The witch trials, as portrayed here, are a display of natural selection in action: to purge society of the undesirable, one's unpleasant rivals and out-lived authority figures, or those who dare to tell us things we don't want to hear, even if it means the ultimate price. Given the right incentives, it could be anyone. It could have stopped with the Salem girls themselves  except in reality, they were between 9 and 12 years old. From time to time, it seems human society needs sacrificial animals, mad dogs or stray lambs, complete with remorse and self-disgust soon afterwards, and shoulder-clapping a few years later how much it has moved on since. Oh Lord, deliver us from temptation  but only yesterday.This film shouldn't be forced upon teens and schoolchildren just because teachers can't make up lectures that can be endured with open eyes. It's for adults, with its multi-layered characters and multi-colored social strata that movie time allows only a short glimpse at. It's simply enjoyable for all its dark beauty and romance. Only in the sense that the bad, or rather: the ugly who play along or keep their heads down, ultimately ""win"", is it a morality play. No-one is entirely evil, with maybe the exception of Judge Thomas Danforth, at whose motives one is free to guess. Again, one shouldn't confuse fiction with reality.The film deserves extra credit for its self-restraint  it doesn't show off gory torture techniques or live burnings (again) à la The Name of the Rose. Fortunately, Salem used the practice of hanging. I missed some of the end titles where it says that Abigail Williams, according to ""legend"", ended up as a harlot (and died at age 17, Wikipedia tells us). Hell hath no fury but a ((enter gender here)) scorned, is a well-worn chauvinism among ((enter gender here)), but it's the only cheap trick in the movie. Hell hath no fury but our longing for freedom, and the movie-John seems to have liberated Abi from quite a lot, but not quite enough. Even in those times, sylphing naked through the woods must have been very refreshing  especially, since mini skirts hadn't been invented.",The Crucible
60,Spinetinglers,Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!,10,27 February 2008,"After being caught dancing naked in the woods, Abigail Williams hatches a plan with the other girls in the village. Abigail claims that she has been fighting to save her own soul, as she is surrounded by people who worship the devil. Instead of dismissing these claims as foolish ramblings of a young girl, the town elders encourage her hysteria. Accusations fuelled by provincial politics, greed, spite, paranoia, and fear become commonplace. Many people are forced to make the ultimate sacrifice rather than tarnish their good name. Arthur Miller was a prodigious American writer and I am sure, when making a movie of one of his plays, there is a certain amount of trepidation on the part of the Director and the actors to do a reputable job. After all, Mr Miller is not going to be blamed if they make a lousy film. Thankfully, Miller was available to write the screenplay. With a cast that included Daniel Day Lewis, Joan Allen, and Wynona Ryder in her heyday, not much can go wrong and it doesn't. The Crucible is a superb film, filled with frightening insights into mob mentality. It also shows how situations can get completely out of control when rational thought is replaced by foolishness and cruel intolerance. You may argue that The Crucible has lost some of its original impact. It was first shown to American audiences in the 1950s, during McCarthy Era. However, the subtext is still very relevant today because, unfortunately, intolerance, injustice, and mass hysteria are still problems that people face the world over.

Why it took so long to be adapted for the big screen is just baffling to me. Thank God that the genius behind the original text, Arthur Miller, was permitted to write the screenplay - and get an Oscar nomination for it! The cast are all to die for, with Winona Ryder proving she doesn't always have to play lovable characters like Charlotte Flax in Mermaids (1990), or Jo March in Little Women (1994) - her performance as the malicious Abigail Williams is just as outstanding. In her Oscar nominated portrayal of Elizabeth Proctor, Joan Allen leaves an indelible impression of marvellous acting. I was in tears in the scene where she and John Proctor (Daniel Day-Lewis) fall in love all over again. I sincerely hope that The Crucible will be shown in schools/colleges in years to come, to remind us of the horror that occurred in 17th century Salem. A work of cinematic genius.",The Crucible
64,jrm23july@aol.com,"During Psychotic American Times, You're Given A Crucible To Prove Yourself",8,20 March 2006,"""The Crucible"" is adapted from the 1954 play by Arthur Miller. I read ""The Crucible"" in high school and I liked it very much. The big screen version did not match up to Arthur Miller play in depth, design, characterizations, and overall screenplay. However this was an articulate and poignant film and I liked it a lot.The movie takes place in Salem Massachusetts in 1692, the Pre- Revolutionary War days. At the time, people of the Colonies are caught up in the belief of devils, witches, and witchcraft.The story begins in the forest, with the teenagers of Salem engaging in a séance, in which they are calling on the spirits to cast love spells over their boyfriends. Abigail Williams is the ringleader.They are discovered by her uncle, Reverend Parris, who is in a rage when Abigail returns home with his young daughter, who is ill due to the guilt of summoning spirits.To avoid castigation by Reverend Parris and the theologically rigid court system, Abigail and the other girls start accusing several of the adults of witchcraft. They do a tremendous acting job in convincing the church and the courts that they are being attacked by the devil.Judge Danforth of Massachusetts is then brought to Salem to investigate these accusations. Not realizing the motives behind the accusations- lust, greed, anger, etc.- he has several people arrested for attacking the children ""with their spirits"". Among the wrongly accused are a beggar woman, a nurse, and the wife of an adulterer.Joining in with the accusations is Thomas Putnam, a vindictive farmer who couldn't care less about witchcraft and is only after other people's land upon their deaths.Elizabeth Proctor, wife of the movie's hero, John Proctor, is accused of witchcraft by Abgail Williams, who has been secretly fornicating with John Proctor. Proctor, to protect his wife from hanging, is forced to reveal before the court that he is an adulterer. The naive Judge Danforth does not believe Proctor, and secretly asks Elizabeth whether her husband is an adulterer. When she says no to try to protect her husband, he throws this accusation out of court and charges John Proctor with witchcraft.Proctor is forced to admit that he lied about the adultery charge, and is in fact an agent of the devil, or face hanging. He has to choose between his integrity, and the integrity of his children, or face the death penalty.The Crucible gives insight into the human psyche, showing that intangibles like devils, witches, Satan, and hell, can be motivated by tangibles such as lust, jealousy, land disputes, and anger. This is what makes The Crucible such a good movie. Powerful performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder make this a must see movie. ""The Crucible"" was definitely one of the better films of the 1990's.",The Crucible
65,joelsmith190,"A wonderful drama and an excellent adaptation carried to near perfection, only let down (minorly) by a decent musical score.",10,11 January 2016,"The Crucible is a drama and a 1997 film adaptation of Arthur Miller's play of the same name. The play (and the movie, by extension) is set during the Salem Witch Trials and is an allegory for the Red Scare. Being a victim of the Red Scare, it's natural that this story was personal to Miller, and it really shows in how polished and well written the play and movie are. And before you misconceive anything, the movie was actually still written by Arther Miller and he basically adapts it very accurately. The only differences tend to be new scenes added in to update the play and improve it.The first thing I have to talk about is the acting. Everyone here does a fantastic job, especially Winona Ryder, who really owns her character. When they are supposed to be deceptive, they feel deceptive. When they are supposed to feel melancholy, they do. When they are supposed to be happy, they are. This cast really runs the gamut of amazing performances, and as I said, I absolutely love Winona Ryder in this.The characters are all incredibly interesting or likable. Daniel Day-Lewis's John Proctor (arguably the main character) isn't some white bread dude. He's made his mistakes, he's failed, but at the end of the day you can still tell he's a good guy and understand his actions, even if you don't always agree with them. Outside of Abigail Williams and maybe John Proctor, I also adored Giles Cory for his personality and stubbornest. The dialogue fits the time period, making it feel authentic. And it's still wittily written and can get a few laughs here and there.As far as the costumes and sets go, they are wonderfully well done. It all fits the time and looks authentic. It still looks great regardless too, and there is no CGI or any bullshit to ruin the look of this film. The atmosphere is incredibly dark and tense, though I wouldn't say on Deathtrap levels of intensity.The plot is incredibly well written and makes sense from beginning to end. The characters never feel like they're changing just because the plot needs them to. Instead, they evolve and develop rather naturally, and it's really believable when you see some guy who was naive at the beginning to understanding exactly what's going on at the end. I also have to give massive props to the romance in the film. It's not often that I ever praise romance in a film, as I inherently tend to dislike the element as it's not often particularly well done, but the Crucible goes the whole nine yards. While couples like the Proctors undeniably have chemistry between one another, they still fight and they still have to deal with other problems with their relationship the whole way through, and the fact that it never feels forced deserves massive kudos.The musical score isn't amazing, but it's definitely fine. It's your standard, sweeping orchestral soundtrack with nothing really new to spice things up. Surely serviceable, but it's also surely worth mentioning.It's not often that I bother to mention cinematography, but this film is beautifully shot.The Crucible is undeniably one of the greatest drama films I've seen-- it's up there with V for Vendetta, it's that good. I truly have no real criticisms to level at the Crucible. It's just an amazing ride and kept me interested the entire two hours. If you see it around sometime and you like some good drama in your films, definitely check it out. The Crucible gets a 10/10.",The Crucible
66,derekprice1974,Good look at how gullible religious people can be.,7,27 August 2004,"Growing up in the Bible belt, it's quite easy to see how gullible people can be when it comes to religion.  I can only imagine how during the time period that this took place, how religion was the end-all, be-all, and scientific discoveries hadn't disproven most of it, that people would easily believe that someone was powerful.  For example (spoiler!!), the scene where the wood falls and the lady is tried for being a witch because another lady saw it fall and then blames the first lady as causing it with her ""witch"" powers.  Have these people never heard of gravity or earth tremors that make things fall naturally?  Apparently, they haven't.  If you do not find religion to be all that is cracked up to be, you'll find this movie quite enjoyable because seeing how Winona Ryder's character and a few other's employ the ""witch"" factor to their advantage is quite funny.",The Crucible

DANIEL DAY-LEWIS REFUSING TO TAKE A SHOWER!,7,22 September 2018,"The performances are great all around (DD-L's phenomenal as always, Winona's full of gusto and Joan Allen's subtle) and the camera work is at times quite impressive, but with a plot so repetitive, the narrative becomes rather redundant and the pacing suffers (especially during the beginning)Miller's play holding a mirror to the hideous face of the blacklisting paranoia of the 50s had weight to it. However, transferring it to the silver screen (especially in the 90s) takes away the hugely important context of the source material. The Crucible boils down to a straightforward adaptation. Still it's a poignant meditation on corruption, group mentality and peer pressure with a powerful ending.
So, much like Giles Corey, all I can say is that The Crucible needed ""more... weight.""Also, the mentality that the ""witches"" (almost all female characters tbh) of Salem did it all to attract men is... problematic to say the least.",The Crucible

I find the story to be one-tracked and boring. D-Day Lewis dominates and Joan Allen is top notch. I know the story has very solid metaphors for fearful discrimination but after awhile it's like we get it enough. It's almost to easy to pick up on character motivations in the film, play, or novel adaptations. You know where the story is pretty much headed. It's always thoughtful and mildly interesting but as a film form it's boring and tedious. I also had a problem with Ryder because she was convincing but I saw my four teenage friends play her much scarier, and portraying her for the crazy-messed, kooky, demented bitch she was not just someone like Ryder who showed she was mildly disturbed and only motivated to get Proctor in trouble not because she actually thought she was doing the right thing in her own world. I cant overlook that they seriously all out-performed a ""star"" like Ryder (in my opinion she is so over-rated and now people realize it) Like I said I had a different experience.

Unfortunately, IMO it has a major flaw. ****Spoiler Ahead****The ""good"" people of Salem are supposedly morally uptight, honest to the point rather forfeit their lives than submit to lies and disgrace, yet at the most crucial moment, Elizabeth Proctor chose dishonesty and stupidity (she should know better), an act basically cost many people's lives. While I understand her motive, but such hypocrisy severely undermined the self-righteousness at the end of the movie. After all, what GOOD name could John Proctor have at the time of his final decision?? He had none -- he came across either a liar regarding the affair with Abigail (contradicted by his own wife) and a manipulator of Mary or an adulterer/sinner who had his wife covered for him. All the notions of honor and honesty even in the face of extreme injustice are degraded by this foolish act. And the director actually put sunlight on her face at that moment!?

Although Miller changed some facts in his play, all the people who are portrayed in it were real accusers, ""witches"", reverends and judges during the Salem Witch Trials...

73,Dainius8888,Interesting story about what's right and what's wrong,8,14 July 2011,"At the beginning of the movie I wasn't so sure it would be as good as it turned out to be, because, for me, the opening is quite important, as it sets you on the right track. It let's you feel the atmosphere of the whole movie and prepares you for the rest of it. Now. The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life. And I never quite fancied 17th century village life where family, field work and the church were important elements in life. But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas. I actually wanted to see this movie because the main character is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who is one of my favorite actors. So other that the good story, the performance by this amazing actor is another good reason to watch the movie. Winona Ryder also gives a good performance. Good. Not great. I 'm not saying she isn't a good actress, but Daniel Day-Lewis is the star of the show here.",The Crucible
74,curlyman217,"OK, nothing to write home about",6,23 April 2008,"After watching ""The Crucible"", my feelings are mixed. This movie was an intense motion picture to watch and even more intense for me to interpret. The story itself is not hard to interpret, but trying to convey my feelings on it is difficult.The story of ""The Crucible"" is very basic: a community, mad with hysteria, brings itself to its downfall. The story centers on Abigail Williams, played by Winona Ryder. She was the maid of John Proctor and his wife, Elizabeth, played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen. Elizabeth suspects John of adultery with Abigail, so she and John agree to fire her. Abigail resorts to witchcraft to try and win John's heart, but when her uncle (the Reverend of their village's church) witnesses her dancing with other young girls of the community, she and her cousin are set into a panic. Their dancing was believed to be sinful and full of witchery. The next morning, Abigail's cousin Ruth is paralyzed in bed and this confuses the town. They think that the devil is the one to blame. This sets into motion the hysteria and suspicion of witchcraft and communication with the devil. No one in the village was safe from being condemned by Abigail and her dancing friends. The witch hysteria calls for immediate attention. Enter Judge Thomas Danforth, played by Paul Scofield. There are many trials and many innocent people getting accused of witchery, and no one is exempt, not even John or Elizabeth. The inevitable comes to pass.I thought that this movie was poorly acted. There were some standouts in lead roles, but the supporting roles seemed to have been overlooked. There are four leads in this movie: John Procter, Abigail Williams, Elizabeth Proctor, and Judge Thomas Danforth. John Procter is played with lackluster enthusiasm by the great, two-time Academy Award Winning Daniel Day-Lewis. He seems to lack passion or care until the last scene, but by that time, I had lost hope and resigned myself to his weak performance. It is slightly unfair, though, that I say this, seeing as it was a pretty good performance, but I am naturally going to be biased as I have seen him in so many considerably better performances, some of the best of film (""My Left Foot"", ""There Will Be Blood"", etc.). He should have thought before he set the bar so high for his work. The other bad lead role was Abigail, played horrifically by Winona Ryder. I'll admit, her performance was bad, very bad, but it didn't help that throughout the movie, I despised her character. Even so, I am one to appreciate devious and villainous characters if they are played with villainy and passion. She gave an uninspired performance, to say the least. One of the lead roles that was superbly acted was the role of Elizabeth, played by Joan Allen. She plays her with such subtlety that I couldn't help liking her performance. She was the only member in the cast to receive an Academy Award nomination. The other wonderfully played lead role was the role of Judge Danforth, played magnificently by Paul Scofield. He played Thomas Moore in ""A Man For All Seasons"", which won him an Academy Award. He is such an implausibly underrated actor; I wish to see him in more roles. He is type-casted in this role, playing another law official, but it's for the better.The writing is nothing to complain about. It follows fairly accurate with the play, although there are some differences, as you would find with any movie based on a previously written material. This movie, though, has an advantage. It was written by Arthur Miller, the same man who wrote the original play. There weren't too many noticeable differences. One scene played out outside, rather than in the courthouse where it was originally set. The dance of the girls was shown in the film, but in the play it was only talked about, but there weren't too many differences. Naturally, the dialogue was drawn out longer, but the duration of the movie is longer then the duration of the play. I liked the satiric aspect of the movie. If one of the girls had a grudge to bear with any member in town, they would recall an instance in the past that would make officials believe that the person was a witch. I thought that it was funny in a way, but the directing made it less comedic and more pitiful and dramatic. The scenery was dreary and tired and worn down. The filming was bland and forgettable. ""The Crucible"" lends itself better as a play than a movie. This play was based on an event happening at the time that Miller wrote it.Senator Joseph McCarthy was spitting out accusations everywhere that people were Communists. If they denied that they were Communists, then they were thought guilty and were declared Communists, but if they admitted to being one, then they were let off the hook. This modern day witch-hunt known as ""McCarthyism"" mirrors Miller's play almost exactly.The movie had many flaws. It made me feel uncomfortable and eerie, which makes me not like it, but thinking over that, I realize that that is possibly the director's intention, and if so, then well done. I can only recommend it to people that are interested in the witch-hunts. It wasn't that boring, it was actually entertaining (in a strange way), but it was very predictable. It was a strange movie, the acting was OK, the story is good, but the direction was weak. There were some very tense moments on screen, which made for thrilling cinema, but its faults are greater then its perks, but I think it would be worth it to check it out.",The Crucible

The characters and the settings and the plot elements all match up with the play for certain, but Hytner's adaptation barely brings anything new to the table. The story stays the same, the setting is still just as the play described, and the actor's performances all fit the bare minimum description of what the play gave them. Characters like Abigail Williams are written in very interesting ways in the original play, but Winona Ryder's performance only works, to some degree, because she doesn't add anything onto her character beyond what is written of her. The same goes for several of the characters, particularly the judge in charge of the case. These performances are competent, sure, but with a play as interesting as The Crucible, the performances were, for the most part, underwhelming. Film is a visual medium, and a much more visually artistic medium than a theatrical play or a written novel. Hytner is already given the first component to making a good film with The Crucible to begin with, but he doesn't take advantage of his chosen medium and expand upon what is written. The film's sets are underwhelmingly designed, the cinematography is relatively bland, and again, the performances of the characters are all very by-the-book.

83,sugar_n_spice,I am not someone to randomly give out a perfect score for a movie...,8,22 September 2006,"...And I also happen to be a very critical person of most films. With that being said, The Crucible completely blows me away with its virtually flawless cinematic achievements!Daniel Day-Lewis is absolutely superb as John Proctor; there is no other way to put it. He is simply perfect, from his bitter, withdrawn opening few lines to when he is accused of witchcraft by his former adulterous--and scorned--lover (Winona Ryder) and begins passionately fighting for his very life and existence--and, of course, his name.Winona Ryder turns in a beautiful performance as the disturbed and tragic Abigail Williams: a Puritain orphan raised by her super-strict, brutal, and overall villainous uncle. She becomes infatuated with John Proctor, a married man and a bit of an outcast to their society, and is willing to do anything and everything to 'obtain' him, if you will.Joan Allen's Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress was not undeserved. Her portrayal of the honest and saintly Elizabeth Proctor (not fake innocence, like Abigail's) was touching and a bit heart-wrenching toward the end (won't give that away here).It wasn't just the awesome acting that won me over, but the authentic Old English dialog, the somewhat grainy cinematography (which provided an uneasy feeling in viewing the town of Salem), and wonderful sets and costumes that really made this a classic for me, and my all-time favorite movie. Highly recommend it! A perfect 10/10!",The Crucible
84,AndyWakes,Relevant but inert,5,6 January 2015,"Arthur Miller's play ""The Crucible"" is a very important allegory that is as relevant today in the post-9/11 world as it was in the 50's during the height of McCarthyism. Yet despite the relevance of the play, it's hard not to view the movie as a letdown. It has Daniel Day-Lewis (perhaps the greatest active actor) in the lead role and the film's voice of reason John Proctor, but even he can seem to make his character wholly believable. It seems as though nearly every character in the film inhabit roles of symbols, rather than real people. The characters act only to underscore Miller's political commentary rather than to deliver a nuanced study of humanity. Characters so quickly devolve into a state of hysteria that it's nearly impossible to believe. Miller and the film's point with this are to show how mob mentality and the basic human instinct to find a culprit in inexplicable circumstances lead people to behave irrationally. But these scenes are completely inorganic and only serve the film's themes, which badly harms its credibility. Despite the seriousness and intended importance of this film, it's hard to take a film seriously that features a dead-pan Daniel Day- Lewis surrounded by dozens of screaming, hysterical individuals. Unfortunately, this film will likely inspire more unintended giggles than deep conversations about human nature.",The Crucible

As far as acting goes she demonstrated that she can really rock!  It is hard to make a beautiful innocent looking girl such a bad one, but Winona Ryder did just that, and made it look as real as it gets.  If you have not seen this movie, you should see it just for that.  It did not make the movie a total hit though.  The Crucible did not even make me giggle once.  Even though it was a drama, this one needed a few laughs befor the end.  It lacked some apples in the overall entertainment bin but still pulled through to entertain you. Even though it was a great movie, and Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder did a great job of acting, it still needed just a little somthing more here and there.  Overall, I give it a 9 because Winona Ryder, once again, ROCKED!!!!",The Crucible
88,McPearson,Heartwrenching Drama,10,27 August 2003,"Arthur Miller is one of my favorite playwrights.  Being a drama major, I read a lot of Miller.  THE CRUCIBLE is by far my favorite.  It has been for the last six years.  This film version is great, not only the acting by some principles, but the sets, costumes, script, and (maybe I'm weird) music. Winona Ryder is exceptional as Abigail, who starts the whole witchcraft thing.  Daniel Day Lewis is too subtle and quiet as John Proctor.  Judge Danforth is boring in the film.  Joan Allen is wonderful.  She plays the long suffering wife Elizabeth Proctor and she is just as saintly as the character is supposed to be.  The final scene with John and Elizabeth Proctor makes me cry every time when Elizabeth confesses to John that...""...it was a cold house I kept.  Forgive me John.

89,kelligriffis,Best it could be,8,17 September 2003,"I first saw this film in the theater in 1997.  My impression then was the same as it is now, after numerous viewings: this is just about the best movie that could be made of The Crucible.  The script takes the best of Miller's original words and uses the film medium to great advantage to *show* several events that the play is constrained to tell.  I am an English teacher, and I use this film every year when my students read the play. The acting is, for the most part, great.  Most of the negative reader comments on this page dealing with themes, morals, plausibility, etc. apply equally to the play version; to me they represent fidelity to the original text rather than flaws. The Crucible will never be a ""feel-good"" work, but this is an excellent adaptation and a moving film.",The Crucible
90,andy191989,"Good Finale, Good Aspects, Overall Moderate",6,24 October 2015,"The Crucible is hard to adapt to the big screen. It's a long script, and has to be handled in a very particular way or risks being laughable. This production wasn't laughable, but what it was was middle-of-the-road in many aspects. The acting is pitch perfect in some scenes, mainly those representing Act 3 and 4, where the tension is high. However, at lower tensions various actors come across as somewhat bored (such as Joan Allen as Elizabeth Proctor, whos relationship with Proctor initially showed like a school play on screen, with very little chemistry) however this was picked up well by the end. Daniel Day Lewis wasn't perfect as the character. He displayed great care towards Abigail and virtually none for Elizabeth in their first scene together, which makes it look like Proctor wants Abigail more, the exact opposite of the play's intention. Various lines were delivered wrong, and various character interpretations felt contrived (Mary Warren does not start crying hysterically instantly when she sees Proctor, read the play Karron Graves.) but overall, by the end the acting feels balanced enough to be... just below good.The use of lighting, sound, and set was far too naturalistic for my taste. They could have really built up the tension with creative imagery, editing, some good score, a bit more style that would give the representation of Salem more substance. It all feels very normal, which takes away from the theme of hysteria that is supposed to have taken over the whole town. I'm not saying they needed a CGI extravaganza or a Zack Snyder ""Sucker Punch"" style movie (although the latter would be really interesting, actually) but a bit more flair was necessary. In my opinion, anyway.Finally, the addition of scenes: Again, very mixed in results. The scene in the woods? Well done, well shot, creates a good atmosphere and actually adds to Abigail's character early on. The end scene with the Lord's prayer? Really solid, interesting, poignant, and historically accurate to one person actually hung in Salem. The scene where Proctor confronts Abigail in the woods? No. That showed a complete lack of understanding of the text. Elizabeth being arrested in the play was a result of Proctor being selfish and NOT putting what was right over his desire to keep a good name and not to hurt Abigail despite knowing what she did was wrong, and this scene missed the mark so hard it wasn't even funny, it kind of made me cringe and say ""No! You were going so well!""Like I said, it's moderate. The acting's okay, but not great (apart from Winona Ryder as Abigail. She, in my opinion, was perfect) the technical aspects are accurate, but very uninteresting, and the addition of scenes sometimes misses the mark. Was it as bad as some adaptations of great plays? No. But that doesn't mean it deserves more praise than it gets. The movie was fine, but the play was brilliant, and that's what stings the most about this movie.",The Crucible
91,verity_farseer,Really Chilling Movie,8,1 July 2006,"I just finished watching this movie and WOW, the way the movie was created start to finish was brilliant, gritty and intense. I'm not a fan of Winona Ryder at all and only marginally of Daniel Day-Lewis (In short because of Gangs Of New York, although really good acting the rest of the film was awful) their performances were awesome.I really loved the themes of the movie and the whole mob mentality of the girls. I was really gunning for a certain female teenager being hanged. The scene where DDL and WR are forced to face the front while DDL wife is asked questions is in my opinion one of the most intense and heart breaking scenes in film history.Bottom Line is: If you get the chance to see this movie DO!!! it will shock and challenge your way of thinking",The Crucible
92,louisfergie,Great direction and style let down by a poor script and mediocre acting,7,18 October 2005,"I am currently studying ""The Crucible"" as part of my English A-Level, and when I first heard a few weeks ago that the play had been transformed into a screenplay I was a little worried. In my experience plays which are adapted for the screen tend to lose something that made the particular play so brilliant in the first place. In the case of ""The Crucible,"" that something is the brilliant interaction between the characters and the rousing of sympathy that the audience (or reader) has for those under accusation of witchcraft. And unfortunately, the screen version of ""The Crucible"" loses these two vital aspects of the play which made it so successful when it was first written over 50 years ago. The main characters come across as one dimensional and rather bland, giving the audience no definitive reason to like them or feel sympathetic to their plight. These characters spend the whole time shouting, bickering and chasing after each other with threats and accusations, which in the play was done far more subtlety and with more poetic language. It's Arthur Miller who lets the film down, as his script loses the respectful nature of the play, and Winona Ryder puts in a cringe-worthy performance as accused girl Abigail Williams, spending 99.9% of her time shouting and going red in the face with rage, making Abigail seem more like a spoilt brat than a scheming bully (as she was in the play). Reverend Hale was completely the opposite to the kind, gentle man of the play, and came across as a hotheaded witch-hunter who liked nothing better than terrifying his victims into a false confession. The other characters similarly lose the subtleties they had in the play.However, the direction of the film is in places magnificent. The opening scenes are full of mystery, tension and atmosphere, and the set is very authentic and large enough to look like a village, as opposed to just a film set. The rushing through of Acts 1 and 2 of the play does not detract from the story as it allows enough of the story to come through without all the endless dialogue and standing around while characters accuse each other, go off for a bit, and come back to accuse someone else or try to clear their name. The court scenes are marvellously handled and the costumes are also superb and accurate. The music is similarly brilliant overall, especially at the beginning.Overall, a poor script and poor acting let's this film down, and the subtleties of the play are all but obsolete. The marvellous direction and outstanding quality of the set, costumes and music more than make up for this big screen version of a brilliant play. The final rating has to be 7/10.",The Crucible
93,minasant,"Great Movie, rich and interesting",8,8 May 2005,"A beautiful adaptation from Arthur Miller's Play, The Crucible is not only a tragic story narrating the witch hunt that happened in Salem, but it is also a great story that develops around the human nature and human relationships.In fact this movie has so much to say to it, that any good Psycanalist would write at least 100 pages about it. The movie focuses on fear in us, human beings, as it being the only emotion responsible for creating chaos. Around it the relationship love and hate is also explored. Eventually Abigail (Winona Ryder)unchains a cycle of vengeance, hate, fear and lies which will lead a whole town to begin a ridiculous killing and hanging. She unchains a collective hysteria so to say, which will make even the most innocent soul collaborate in those crimes. On court the scenes become enormously interesting, the suspense keeps you tied to your sofa for the entire film. In the End it all resumes to our human nature and how far can we go with our emotions and actions.",The Crucible

99,marksupanat-95787,OK Movie (For HS HW),7,18 February 2020,"The Crucible is a 1996 film directed by Nicolas Hytner, screenplay by Arthur Miller and starring Daniel-Day Lewis, Winona Ryder and Paul Scofield. The topic of witch trials or witch hunts has been relevant to Hollywood for many years, whether adapted from Salem or inspired by Salem, none does it like Arthur Miller's script for the Crucible. While the Salem Witch Trials is something we look back in the past and we think 'Oh, that's silly' and we look at the ancient quirks of people falsely accusing other people of witchcraft, which we can resoundingly say, was just absolutely ridiculous. However, the trials aren't the main plotline in 'The Crucible', it is merely a catalyst to reveal the basic human flaws that we all have and how we humans grow in numbers whether morally wrong or not; very historically relevant then and still contextually relevant.
The movie begins a group of young girls having a wild party in the woods near Salem, the Massachusetts village where they live, complete with erotic dancing and fantasies about magic spells aimed at people they don't like. Caught in the act by Reverend Parris, and hauled before the strict elders of their community, they blame the devil for their crimes. To strengthen their defense, they launch a smear campaign against various local women, accusing them of witchcraft and consorting with the forces of evil.
Their accusations caused alarms in the citizens, and the accusation spreads, causing the whole town to an uproar. The story takes a turn when we are introduced to John Proctor, a farmer with a good reputation who'd had an illicit relationship with Abigail Williams one of the girls in the wild party, and her true intentions on starting the witch trials are revealed.
Daniel-Day Lewis plays John Proctor and he is his usual self here, amazing; emotionally delivering every line with the prominent sentiment, and perhaps providing one of the most emotionally shaking monologues in his career, where we could feel his aura through the screen. Winona Ryder plays Abigail Williams, and she plays the antagonist perfectly. Balancing the sense of teenage idiocy with true human evil, where she actually made me hate her, genuinely, I despise Abigail William even more after watching the movie. Stand-out performances for me, is Rob Campell as Reverend Hale, and Joan Allen as Elizabeth Proctor. While some of the characters felt fake and dramatized/artificial, Hale and Elizabeth Proctor seemed the most real for, they seemed like actual people and all their decisions and reactions to dilemmas seemed rational.
Continuing on the artificiality of the characters, the movie takes place in 17th Century Massachusetts, and I'll admit, it is hard to portray a society that was in the background of the history books, but all of the characters play to stereotypical actions and accents of a typical renaissance British person, running, screaming and scurrying around as if they know they're in a movie. Main characters are also outshined by their co-stars most of the time. Judge Danforth had one good scene where he talked to Elizabeth Proctor in court, but all his other scenes he is outshined by either Hale or John Proctor, lacking any real sense of humanity and just looked like a typical big authority figure. In addition to the artificiality of the characters, the film lacks weight behind the climax as they don't seem urgent or... climatic at all. The true climax is John Proctor's monologue, where it is supposed to be the trials itself. The movie lacks subtlety, still not climatic in the third act, but we can see Hytner, desperately attempting to make it more dramatic; kicking the score to unreasonable amounts of drama and using a lot of action shots, as if the plot itself wasn't invigorating enough. A good example of subtlety that could've done better if some of the more emotional scenes were just silent, no need for background music, and he does it well with the last scene, where we just hear a creak then it fades to black.
In conclusion, the Crucible is a good film that could've been great, they have outstanding performances by lead and supporting characters, which I think overshadows some of the worse performances. Creative pacing is an issue but is helped by Arthur Miller's incredible script and dramatisation of the original story itself. So overall I would give The Crucible a B-.",The Crucible
100,pholrachp,this is for my english class.,7,18 February 2020,"The movie ""The Crucible"" directed by Nicholas Hytner, released on November 27, 1996, was considered to be a very good movie filled with knowledge about that time of the world. This movie received a 6.8/10 rating from IMDb, 68% from rotten tomatoes, 84% from Metacritic, and a 66% from the audience. They've also been nominated for 29 awards and won 4 awards, which are: Best Actor in a Supporting Role from the BAFTA Awards, Best Supporting Actress from the Critics Choice Awards, Best Actress from the Empire Awards, and Best Supporting Actress from the Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards. Judging from the awards they received and the ratings they've got I would say that this film was pretty successful at that time, and the audiences were pretty pleased with it. Considering the fact that this movie was released during 1996, which means that it was filmed on a time scale between 1994-1995, I would say that this movie was shot and acted out really impressively because of the technology back then and everything. The book version of this film was released on January 22, 1953, which means that the film was made based on the book. Consequently, people who loved the book might have different opinions on the film than the people who only watched the film because, of course, it is impossible to recreate the film exactly the same as the book, and it would also be less entertaining if it was exactly the same. However, since I have both read the book and watched the movie I would say the film was very similar to the book, the main ideas, and plots of the movie are the same there are only a few details where they are different from the book version. To summarize the film it starts off with after John Proctor decides to break off his affair with his young lover, Abigail Williams, she leads other local girls to do witchcraft to wish death upon John Proctor's wife, Elizabeth Proctor. When the ritual is discovered, the girls are brought to trial. Accusations began, and witch hunts started. It wasn't long before, Elizabeth is suspected of witchcraft, and John's attempt to defend her only made it worse. If I would have to rate this I would give it a 7 out of 10. The reason that the score is pretty low is because of the sequence of the story. While watching the film I got sleepy a couple of times, I believed that the reason I got sleepy was because of how slow the story is. When I say a story is slow I mean that the conflicts and the rising action that leads to the climax are introduced to the audience pretty late in the movie, making the first parts of the film kind of boring because of how much dialogue and boring scenes there are. Also, I don't like films that are slow-paced and that's why I deducted three points from the full score. However, I think that seven is a good rating already. The reason I gave it a seven is because I liked the camera angles that they chose to do, how it ended, and the language they used in the film. I really like the camera angles of this film because it really shows who is powerful and who is not. There was especially one scene where the camera flies over a crowd of people, while they are all running. That liked that shot because it shows how scared everyone is and how many people there are on that spot. I also liked the shots and how they set where the actor should stay of Judge Danforth in the film because it really shows how he has the power to control everything there in the name of god. The shots that show the people accused being sad is also really impressive because it's a camera angle that is tilted down, or basically from the eye of the judges. By tilting the camera angle down it shows that the person being accused has no hope left and that they are really powerless. Therefore, I feel that camera angles play a very big role in films and they are sometimes what makes the film more appealing. I also liked how it ended because in the end John Proctor was hanged, along with Rebecca Nurse and Martha Corey, while they were all saying their prayers. This shows that they all believe in god and they are being accused of something they didn't do. It makes the audience think and elaborate on why they suddenly all start praying at even the last scene of the film. Lastly, I liked the language they used in the film because it really gives an essence of the times back then and it shows us how far we've developed. Even though the language may be sometimes hard to understand, it is still the English we know and the English we use till today. Thus, these are the three reasons why I gave the movie a seven out of ten. This movie ""The Crucible '' is a film that is based on a true story during the 17th century, which means that by watching this film you would get some knowledge of what it is like and how it is at that time of the world. All in all, I recommend this film to everyone because it could give us some knowledge about that time of the world and also may teach us about the film techniques they used in the film.",The Crucible
101,hugonewman,Seriously Underrated,10,2 March 2008,"This must be one of the most underrated films I've ever seen. A stunning story that retains the impeccable artistry of Miller's original play. The performances are exceptional. Day-Lewis is unsurprisingly mesmeric, but Joan Allen steals the show, in spite of her relatively peripheral role. I think hers is the finest female supporting performance I've seen in cinema in the last 15 years. Paul Scofield's portrayal of Judge Danforth is frighteningly believable. The story itself is a timeless parable of political and communal hysteria, underscored by Miller's conscious yet nonetheless sincere apposition of the story with the frenzy of McCarthyism in the US. But the real triumph of the story, and the film, is how beautifully it depicts the emotional ruptures which infuse the public discord. How this film has been allowed to sink into the margins, and how subscribers to IMDb can give it anything less than an 8, is wholly beyond me. A 10. Without question.",The Crucible
