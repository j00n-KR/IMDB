0,Leofwine_draca,A sometimes interesting mess of a film,5,5 January 2015,"This isn't a particularly bad film, but it is all over the place and it's rather hard to either enjoy it or pigeonhole it. It's a fictionalised account of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe, in which he finds himself assisting the Baltimore police force in their hunt for a serial killer whose crimes reference those in Poe's own fiction.THE RAVEN is an odd cross between period Gothic, slasher horror, and detective story, and none of those genres really work all that well. The mystery stuff is based on contrivance and coincidence than real detective work, and the gory kills feel a little silly given their literary origins. What I did like were all of the Poe references in the film, which I picked up on having read a lot of the author's works.What I didn't like was John Cusack whose domineering, shouty performance turns the whole thing into melodrama. I've never liked Cusack, in fact, and his miscast turn as Poe merely consolidates that opinion. The rest of the cast is more dependable, particularly with the likes of Brendan Gleeson and Luke Evans, although Alice Eve is another weak link playing the usual love interest/damsel in distress. THE RAVEN did keep me watching and it's not a particularly bad film, but I can't help but feel it could have been so more successful in the right hands.",The Raven
1,SnoopyStyle,Could be darker and needs more energy,6,6 June 2014,"Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) is found near death on a park bench in Baltimore on October 7, 1849. Then it flashes back days earlier. There is a serial killer on the loose and detective Fields (Luke Evans) is investigating. Poe is self-obsessed, possibly washed up, may be drinking too much, and is marrying lovely Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve). Fields discovers the similarities between the murders and Poe's writing. Poe becomes a possible suspect or at least the inspiration for the crimes. Emily's father Capt Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) is in charge. Then Emily is taken and they get a note challenging Poe.It is dark, moody and grotesque. I wish this could be even darker. John Cusack is going darker than usual but he still has his boyish light charms. It needs more tension and more excitement. I like where this movie is going but I just wish it pushes even harder. Poe may be shocking once upon a time. The blood and guts isn't gruesome anymore. It's very slow at times and Poe doesn't have the energy. This could use a lot more energy.",The Raven
2,Prismark10,Too poe faced,4,30 March 2018,"With so many actors from the British Isles, you can guess that some European city is passing itself off for 19th century Baltimore.Horror writer Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) has returned to Baltimore, down on his heel, needing a drink and a newspaper editor willing to publish his work. His best writing days are behind and no one wants to know him, in fact most do not know who he is.Pretty soon a killer inspired by Poe's writings is slaughtering people. in all sorts of nasty ways. Smart Baltimore police Inspector Fields (Luke Evans) first suspects Poe but then enlists him for his help as he needs Poe's knowledge of his own works to find the killer. Time is running out as Poe's girlfriend has been kidnapped.The film is a police procedural mixed with campy horror. Cusack's take on Poe feels all wrong. However you go to applaud a film that takes the writer Poe and puts him in his own ridiculous horror tale.",The Raven
3,claudio_carvalho,Nice Cinematography with a Boring Story and Unpleasant Characters,5,8 September 2012,"In 1849, in Baltimore, Edgar Allen Poe (John Cusack) is a penniless writer with drinking problem that writes reviews in the Baltimore Patriot. Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) and he are in love but her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) despises him. When a mother and her twelve year-old daughter are mysteriously murdered in a locked room, the efficient Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) finds a hidden spring in a window nailed shut that opens the window and he recalls an Allen Poe story. Then the writer Griswold (John Warnaby) that has criticized the stories of Poe is murdered in the same way of another gory story. They find a scarlet mask in Griswold and Poe recalls another tale about another murder in a ball. Fields believes that the killer has inspired in Edgar Alen Poe's stories to commit his crimes and that Emily is in danger. Captain Hamilton does not call off the party and the criminal creates a diversion to kidnap Emily. Now Poe must participate in a game following the killer's instruction. ""The Raven"" is a movie with a nice cinematography, but also with a boring story and unpleasant characters. The film is directed with heavy hand by James McTeigue that makes a movie without witty situations like, for example, in Sherlock Holmes films. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Corvo"" (""The Raven"")",The Raven
4,nogodnomasters,starsIN HER TOMB BY THE SOUNDING SEA,6,17 August 2018,"It starts out innocent enough. A reinterpretation of King Arthur and the Roman empire. Some more histories based on one iota of fact. Then we get a retelling of Robin Hood and stories of the Middle Ages, Shakespeare, and the next thing you know Abe Lincoln is killing vampires and zombies. Now Poe. It seems the liberties with history has become progressively worse.This is a fictional story using the real character of Poe, his works, that fact he lived in Baltimore and not much more. The writers of the script wanting to ward off such criticisms have Poe ask, ""Is imagination a felony?"" Poe teams up with Detective Fields (Luke Evans) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) to find Emily (Alice Eve) who is being held by a man who is killing people in the manner of Poe's tales.There were a number of things that I didn't like in this blockbuster, first being Cusack's portrayal of Poe himself. It wasn't convincing for me. The opening scene of a full moon, a raven, and a woman screaming was a little too cliche. I felt insulted that the writer thought he could get away with such a shallow script. This is not a good horror story, not a good slasher film, not a good pseudo history, not a good mystery, and not a good love story. It does have a certain amount of appeal to it, but nor worth to go run out and see.Poe fans do not need to feel they have to rush out and watch this film. The film doesn't really catch his genius and madness.Parental guide: one F-bomb, no sex, no nudity, some Alice Eve cleavage. No music by the Alan Parson's Project.",The Raven
5,kosmasp,Another Poe,7,1 August 2012,"I think this movie might be appalling to Poe fans. I'm not that familiar with everything concerning Edgar Allan Poe, so I might not be the best judge, if you try to find out if this is anything like him or close to what is known of him. But I don't think that matters much for this movie. Quite the opposite, I really think this movie works as a thriller (even with a heightened? Poe in it!).I like John Cusack in it and it does have a few scary moments in it too. The cast overall is good. And while the story might go where you expect it to go (I don't think there will too many surprises), I still think it works quite fine. A nice little thriller, that might get hurt by the name it got or not. Another take that might be compared to the recent Holmes adaptations (by Guy Ritchie) ...",The Raven
6,gavin6942,"Beautiful, Brilliant, But Miscast",7,16 February 2013,"When a madman begins committing horrific murders inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack), a young Baltimore detective (Luke Evans) joins forces with Poe to stop him from making his stories a reality.The idea of setting a murder mystery in Baltimore at the time of Poe, with Poe as a character and with his stories as the inspiration seems genius on the face of it. Indeed, he is a great character in a great time and his stories are a great inspiration for murder (as we have seen in the many film adaptations that were inspired by his work). It does seem a bit weird to put a real man in a fictional story, but if we can have ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"", I guess it is okay.If you have an issue with it, I understand your sense of accuracy and need for historical continuity. It might have made more sense to put the story after the time of Poe (say, the 1850s) and had the killer be inspired, with a detective who knows the tales well. Or have Poe trying to solve another murder, perhaps one that even happened. You know, like Mary Cecilia Rogers, the ""beautiful cigar girl"".Some people had an issue with John Cusack's Edgar Allen Poe. I feel their pain. Although I loved Cusack's delivery of the lines, I never felt like he looked the part. He looked too much like himself. Ideally, they should have cast Jeffrey Combs. Combs not only looked spot on as Poe in ""Black Cat"", he did a one-man stage show. Combs eats, sleeps and breathes Poe. And, as an added bonus, he probably costs less than Cusack.Luke Evans was great and stole the show with his incessant intensity. Every line was dramatic, and it worked. Evans kept the film alive for me, as did the beautiful scenery and cinematography. Whatever was lost with Cusack was gained with the coloration and lighting. Great, great work. I could have used less CGI blood, though.",The Raven
7,jboothmillard,The Raven,5,29 April 2015,"I heard a little about the film during its release in cinemas, but found our much more so when it came to DVD, including the meaning of the title and who the leading actor was playing, so I decided to try it, directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta). Basically, set in the 19th Century, in Baltimore, Maryland, writer Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack), most famous for the short poem ""The Raven"", is penniless and writing reviews in the Baltimore Patriot newspaper to get by, he is in love and wanting to marry Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), but he is despised by her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson). A mother and her twelve year old daughter are found mysteriously murdered in a locked room, efficient Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) recalls one of the stories of Allen Poe, so the writer is called in to give his verdict, and a short time later the murder of his rival writer Griswold (John Warnaby) occurs, with the murderer inspired by another of Poe's stories. It soon becomes apparent that a serial killer is on the loose and murdering people using the descriptions from the works of Poe, the stories quoted and used during the film are ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (the gory death of Griswold), ""The Masque of the Red Death"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"". But the situation gets much more intense for Poe when the perpetrator uses a diversion to kidnap Emily, she is seen buried alive in a coffin under earth in a shallow grave, which is located beneath the printing floor of Poe's office, Captain Hamilton refuses to call of the search party assigned to find her. Emily is eventually returned and the killer does reveal himself to Poe, it is the newspaper's typesetter Ivan (Sam Hazeldine), he calls himself ""Reynolds"", he offers Poe a drink and explains his plan, Poe was unaware that the drink had been poisoned, following his story Ivan escapes. In the end Poe is becoming weaker due to the poisoning, (as in real life) he is last seen behaving delirious and rambling by a man on a park bench, with his last moment of strength he says ""Tell Fields his last name is Reynolds"", his corpse is seen by Fields, but with these words he is able to connect the dots and he does find the killer. Also starring Pirates of the Caribbean's Kevin McNally as Maddux, Oliver Jackson-Cohen as John Cantrell, Pam Ferris as Mrs. Bradley, Brendan Coyle as Reagan, Jimmy Yuill as Captain Eldridge and Dave Legeno as Percy. Cusack gives a performance as the boozy and broke writer turned investigator, and Evans is likable as his police officer sidekick, the story is interesting, with a killer turning dark fiction into reality, there are predictable moments, but the gory moments, the mystery element and the Gothic feel makes this watchable, a not bad period thriller. Worth watching!",The Raven
8,rmax304823,The Ghoul Haunted Woodland of Baltimore.,6,29 May 2013,"John Cusack, as Edgar Allan Poe, eats a human heart. Or does he just slice it up a bit and the raven eats it? It was too dark to tell.At heart, so to speak, this is one of those familiar serial-killer movies in which some madman imitates the various deaths that have taken place in Poe's stories. Poe is about at the end of his rope here, so he's all written out and the murderer has plenty of material to work with. Of course there are variations on the literary works. Yes, a man is strapped beneath a swinging pendulum but this time the pendulum is lowered -- quickly, so as not to bore the viewer with too much suspense -- until it cuts the victim in half and gets stuck somewhere in the thoracic spine.I forget the first time this imitation-of-art device was used by a serial murderer. It might have been the unforgettable ""The Eyes of Laura Mars,"" in which Tommy Lee Jones arranges the slaughtered bodies in ways suggestive of Faye Dunaway's fashion photos. Death imitating art. The most inventive example, among so many inventive examples, may have been ""Copycat"", in which the serial murderer imitates OTHER serial murderers, switching from one to another.At any rate, somebody is knocking off the residents of Baltimore around 1840 and the police ask Poe to give them a hand since, after all, he's provided the killer with his inspiration. Poe doesn't prove to be a very good detective and Cusack doesn't prove to be a very good Poe. Cusack does his best, and he's been quite good in some other efforts, but he doesn't project the torture imposed on him by his fiends from hell. Also, Cusack doesn't do a very good drunk. He just sounds a little louder than usual. And his anger isn't too convincing. It has Poe's contempt in it, but not his savagery.As for his friends from heaven, he has one -- the deliciously named Alice Eve, at once suggestive of bare puberty and sinful nakedness. We get to hear her read some of Poe's wildly alliterative and rhapsodic lines: ""And neither the angels in heaven above, Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.""Cusack gets it on with her, but in a way Poe was probably incapable of by that time in his life. Still, some of the writer's actual biography is insinuated into the dialog here and there. When he deploys the police force in a sewer or examines a corpse, he mentions that he's been in the military. ""West Point. Don't worry -- I was expelled."" After the murders, Poe's girl friend is buried alive somewhere and it's up to Poe to figure out where, judging from truly obscure clues left behind by the murderer at the crime scene. It costs him quite a lot.The visual imagery has a good deal of impact. Every scene seems to be shrouded in darkness. I noticed only two exterior daylight scenes. The lanterns carried by people are only dim glows. The streets are cobblestoned so the hooves of horses and the wheels of carriage rattle loudly across them. It looks like what Baltimore might have looked like in 1840 but it was shot in Novi Sad, near where my dear old Gramps grew up, and in Budapest, where he did his internship as a carpenter. Eastern Europe is becoming a happy hunting ground for location scouts. You can't find anything that looks very 19th century in Western Europe anymore.Cusack isn't a very affable Poe, but then Poe wasn't a very affable guy. But I'm amazed at the volume of his output, considering he died at such an early age. We know his poems and stories but he wrote much more than that -- literary criticism, newspaper articles, fantasies. And he wrote it all out with an old-fashioned pen and a pot of ink. It would take a normal lifetime just to copy it using Poe's tools.",The Raven
9,BA_Harrison,"Quoth the raven: it's OK, I suppose.",6,16 March 2015,"Baltimore, 1849: a devious serial killer is at work, using the works of Gothic horror novelist Edgar Allen Poe for inspiration. After being discounted as a suspect, Poe (played by John Cusack) joins forces with the police to try and solve the case, but becomes emotionally involved after the killer abducts his girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve), leaving a series of ingenious clues as to her whereabouts.James McTeigue's The Raven reminds me of a lot of several other films. As with Time After Time (1979), which sees real-life 19th century novelist H.G. Wells travels through time to pursue Jack the Ripper, McTeigue's movie features a literary legend embroiled in a fictional adventure involving elements of his own writing. With Poe possessing deductive skills rivalling those of Sherlock Holmes, the film is also reminiscent of another '79 movie, Murder by Decree, in which Conan Doyle's detective also hunts down Saucy Jack. This in turn calls to mind the cinematic version of Alan Moore's Ripper-based graphic novel From Hell, with which it also shares a similar visual style.Unfortunately, The Raven isn't quite as accomplished as any of these other films. While it may look great, benefit from some decent performances, and feature one or two moments of impressive gore, the film suffers from a contrived plot, Saw-style logic that enables the villain to construct a fiendishly complex (and probably very expensive) pendulum killing machine, disjointed editing that makes certain scenes impossible to follow, and an unlikeable central character: Poe is an obnoxious egomaniac, his eloquence disconcerting and his demeanour repellent (did people really talk like that back then?), and while this might be accurate for all I know, it doesn't make for much of a hero.5.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 6 for the rather silly but very gory pendulum bisection (hard to believe that such a scene is deemed suitable for a 15 certificate—how times have changed).",The Raven
10,paul_haakonsen,"Great story, but the movie could have been better...",5,10 November 2013,"I am a little bit conflicted about what to think and how to feel about ""The Raven"", now finally having gotten around to watching it.On one hand, then the storyline was rather good and nicely executed by director James McTeigue. And the story does manage to keep you wrapped in the dark about who is the killer that is using the scenarios from Edgar Allan Poe's literature.Then on the other hand, it was a little bit too much, to take an iconic figure in the literature and put him into a murder mystery movie, somewhat resembling ""Murder, She Wrote"" just with a much bigger budget. And also the choice for John Cusack to play Edgar Allan Poe wasn't perhaps the best of choices. Now, don't get me wrong, John Cusack is a great actor and very talented, yes, but he just didn't seem at home or to fit in here in this particular movie or era. Perhaps a better choice would have been on Edward Norton?Regardless, then ""The Raven"" is an entertaining movie and it does manage to keep you nailed to the seat right up to the very end. The story progresses at a nice pace, though it could have been great with an occasional twist here and there, instead of just running out a perfectly straight line. As such, then the story tended to come off as rather scripted and forced.The actors and actresses on the cast list were actually a great ensemble of talents, and people really did bring a lot of personalities and flavor to the movie.There is a lot of nice details and touches to the movie, and it does seem like the audience is actually right there back in the good old days.It does bring something to mind, though, that a movie like this can be brought about, then is the next step a murder mystery with Howard Phillips Lovecraft?",The Raven
11,Coventry,Not macabre enough,5,24 January 2017,"Of course I can't be entirely sure, since unfortunately I have never written a screenplay myself, but I really think that one of the most difficult screenplays to write is that of a deliberately fictional story about real (historical) protagonists. You can't make it too stern or sober, otherwise it's becoming more of a biography, but on the other hand you certainly also can't make it too extravagant or far- fetched, or else you'll risk that the fans of the pivot characters will be offended. I can't think of too many other titles at the moment, apart from ""Agatha"" (Agatha Christie), ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" (Elvis Presley) and this ""The Raven"". Director James McTeigue undertook an admirable, but only semi-successful, effort to fictionalize the final days of the legendary horror author/poet Edgar Allan Poe. The circumstances of Poe's death, at the relatively young age of forty years old, have always been considered vague and mysterious as he was found on a bench in the park whilst heavily confused and delusional. By now, modern medicine has become accurate enough to assume that Poe most likely died from a brain tumor, but I can imagine that in the year 1849 the doctors' diagnosis was either poisoning or opium overdose. The mystery and legend surrounding Poe's death forms the starting point of ""The Raven"". We are introduced to our protagonist – adequate but boringly depicted by John Cusack – when he's in a miserable state It's been a long time since Poe released a successful piece of writing and works on a sort of freelance basis for a crummy newspaper, he struggles with alcohol and drug addictions and the father of his beloved muse Emily literally hates his guts. Just when things can't seem to get any worse, Poe is apprehended for murder by the ambitious Baltimore detective Fields. A mother and her young daughter were gruesomely murdered exactly as described in one of Poe's horror stories, which naturally makes him the prime suspect. Luckily, for our writer at least, another vicious Poe-inspired murder takes place whilst he's being interrogated. Detective Fields and Poe agree to work together in order to stop the killer, and via correspondence in the newspaper they challenge him/her to a cat-and-mouse game. Intriguing and compelling plot, for sure, but horror fanatics immediately recognize it as a total rip-off of Dario Argento's ""Tenebre"". Genre addicts, myself included, will always prefer Argento's version, but admittedly it's a nice touch to replace the fictional author from ""Tenebre"" with the historical horror pioneer Edgar Allan Poe. The first couple of murders are also promising, most notably the massacre with the giant pendulum, but then ""The Raven"" quickly turns into a largely dull, talkative and uninspired secondhand thriller. The whole subplot with Poe's girlfriend being kept buried alive somewhere by the killer is implausible, the references towards Poe's phenomenal work decrease as the plot unfolds itself further. As the search for the killer carries on and becomes less and less interesting, director McTeigue sadly also reverts to dreadful clichés. You know, like the death of the loyal deputy or sinister figures emerging from the fog-enshrouded streets like in cheap Jack the Ripper movies, etc. John Cusack is a terrific actor, but he lacks the natural darkness to properly portray a flamboyant individual like Edgar Allen Poe. I actually don't think that any A-listed nowadays actor is capable of depicting Poe, including Ewan McGregor or Robert Downey Jr. who apparently also stood on the short list. In fact, bleakness and despair is what's missing most in this movie overall. If you're going to make a movie about the oeuvre of the pioneer of macabre tales, please make sure it's as dark and depressing as the oeuvre itself.",The Raven
12,michaelRokeefe,Edgar Allan Poe's fiction becomes reality.,7,8 December 2012,"I was expecting more; but John Cusack hardly ever backs down from a challenging role and knows how to make it work. In the mid 1800s a crazed madman begins committing horrific murders in Baltimore. A young Detective Fields(Luke Evans) realizes the string of macabre killings are the work of the same man and seems to be inspired by the short stories of the famous/infamous Edgar Allen Poe(Cusack). Fields manages to convince Poe to join forces in search of the serial killer and put a stop to making fiction into grizzly reality; but the savvy murderer seems to stay a couple of steps ahead of them. Before all this attention, Poe had his woes getting his work published in the local paper. Soon his work is sought, because of the similarity of his work and the rash of murders. The deadly game of cat and mouse takes on a personal tone when the woman Poe worships, Emily(Alice Eve), is the next target. THE RAVEN is dark and twisted; some scenes appear a bit disjointed; but if you have even the least bit of admiration for Poe's work you'll probably be pleased with this flick. Cusack is darn good playing a dead serious Poe. And kudos to Lucas Vidal for his original score.

13,hitchcockthelegend,Elementary my dear Edgar.,6,14 March 2014,"The Raven is directed by James McTeigue and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. It stars John Cusack, Luke Evans, Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson. Music is by Lucas Vidal and cinematography by Danny Ruhlmann.""On October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found, near death, on a park bench in Baltimore, Maryland. The last days of his life remain a mystery""It's a real smart idea that the makers have here, putting their own theory forward on what happened in the lead up to Poe's death. Essentially a period whodunit procedural as Poe (Cusack) and Inspector Emmett Fields (Evans) race against time to find the person who is killing in the style of Poe's literary works. Poe's love interest, Emily Hamilton (Eve), is in grave danger, so as to add extra peril and suspense into the clock ticking drama.It's a safe piece of entertainment, one that acquaints the uninitiated with Poe's work and his life struggles away from the writing bureau. The detective angle is fun and the murders grizzly and appropriately Gothic in execution. Unfortunately it rarely convinces as a period piece. The dialogue is often out of sync with the era, Eve is miscast, the score is inappropriate and it always feels like actors playing at period rompery. It's a shame that it is bogged down by such irritants because Teague's direction is stylish, while the art design deserves a round of applause. Cusack is fun to watch, but more at ease playing Sherlock in the second half of the piece than a tortured soul in the first, and Evans is confident in the straight backed gentleman detective stakes. There's a good time to be had here on a surface whodunit follow the clues experience, and Poe fans will delight at catching the many references to his life and spiky works, but it unfortunately misses the mark in too many key areas. 6/10",The Raven
14,LeonLouisRicci,"(to Poe)""you stopped writing and I went a little nuts""",6,17 November 2012,"Not nearly as good as the Director's V for Vendetta (2005), this is a slightly above average movie that is elevated by an intriguing premise (much like Time After Time (1979), also a better movie) and John Cusack's interesting performance. There is enough mystery for the who done it types and enough gore for modern Horror fans and enough homage that should generally satisfy Poe's fans.But this is not high art, like Poe. It is a modern, flawed film that has quite a few glaring historical inaccuracies and is another of those bluish looking, color deficient, washed out movies that seem to think that dull gray is an atmosphere.It keeps moving along with some verve, but the double ending is a bit of a letdown. Also, there are some modern screen tricks along the way that belong in other movies. Overall, it is quite entertaining, if not excellent, and is not a misfire, just more cinematic than poetic.",The Raven
15,poolandrews,Enjoyable enough mystery thriller.,5,2 August 2012,"The Raven is set in Baltimore during 1849 where short horror story novelist & poet Edgar Allen Poe (John Cusack) is a broke alcoholic who barely manages to survive writing reviews for the local paper. Poe is in love with Emily (Alice Eve) who is the daughter of rich & powerful businessman Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) who despises Poe & threatens to shoot him if he goes near Emily again, however Emily is deeply in love with Poe & the two are determined to be together & marry each other. Meanwhile several gruesome & unusual killings are being investigated by Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) who soon realises that each of the murders have been copied from one of Poe's stories, Poe is brought in as a suspect but is quickly cleared of suspicion. Poe & Emily plan to announce their marriage at her father's fancy dress ball but Emily is kidnapped by the killer who continues to kill & to taunt both the police & Poe as he uses the life of Emily to make his point...This American, Hungarian & Spanish co-production was directed by James McTeigue & is a fictional account of the final few days of the life of famed short horror story writer Edgar Allen Poe, I say fictional because apart from Poe himself, a few of his stories which are name-checked & the odd minor character nothing much in The Raven could be described as historically accurate or anywhere near approaching fact, for instance there is no historic record of an Emily that Poe planned to marry. The title The Raven has little to do with the film apart from the odd Raven appearing on-screen every so often but is the actual name of a poem Poe wrote in 1845, The Raven is a cool title title but means little. As a historical account of Poe's life The Raven offers little, there are no insights to his inspirations, his struggles or his life beyond he is presented as a man named Edgar Allen Poe who lived in Baltimore. As a work of dramatic fiction The Raven also disappoints somewhat, the big twist at the end when the kidnapper & killer is revealed is rather unsatisfying as this character we no nothing about is revealed to be the killer & quite frankly it could have been anyone as his motivations, his connection to Poe & the means with which he was able to pull off a series of such elaborate crimes remain almost a total mystery. The word flimsy springs to mind. At 110 minutes long The Raven does drag a little in places & after a couple of nice murders director McTeigue then focuses on Emily's kidnapping rather than more gory set-pieces. The film is decent enough, I liked it for what it is but I felt it could have been a lot more, neither satisfying those Poe fans who want an accurate portrayal of him on screen not those merely wanting a straight ahead gory serial killer mystery thriller it lies somewhere between the two. The Raven is neither terrible nor great, it's just sort of watchable & acceptable but never rises above that.Despite Poe being best remembered as a writer of horror stories The Raven is more of a thriller with a great deal of the time spent on the kidnapped Emily & the desperate search for her, the end when the killer is revealed & Poe confronts them feels rushed & makes little impression. There just aren't enough viable suspects in this whodunit murder mystery thriller & how on Earth did the killer manage to construct a full swinging axe on his own? Where did they get the money? Why was no-one suspicious? Where did they find the time while also working a full-time job? I just wished that Poe & the killer had more connecting them & that the killer had more of a twisted motive. Even though the film looks very nice with lots of dark cobbled streets, some dingy period settings & lavish attention to detail there's no attempt to stick to realism as the term Serial Killer wasn't even invented or used until the 1970's for instance.With a supposed budget of about $26,000,000 the film has nice production values for sure, this was mainly filmed in Serbia although set entirely in Baltimore. The acting is pretty good, Cusack is fine & the supporting cast are good too. Apparently both Ewan McGregor & Joaquin Phoenix were offered the role of Poe but turned it down.The Raven is an OK murder mystery thriller that could have been a lot better, the idea of placing the real life horror author Poe in a situation where he has to investigate murders based on his books is neat but the concept never quite comes together here, it lacks a certain something & has no basis in historic fact at all which may annoy devoted Poe fans.",The Raven
16,zardoz-13,Poe-thetic Pabulum!!!,5,29 April 2012,"The age old issue that arises for every generation is the impact of the media on society. Does watching movies, playing video games, and perusing literature prompt us to imitate the actions of fictional characters in certain situations? ""V for Vendetta"" director James McTeigue with ""Loverboy"" scenarist Hannah Shakespeare and rookie writer Ben Livingston have contrived a complicated but uninspired serial killer murder mystery about Edgar Allan Poe. Basically, an anonymous criminal has decided to use Poe as a blueprint for his diabolical deeds. The idea isn't even that original. Back in 1973, horror icon Vincent Price played a vengeful Shakespearean actor in ""Theatre of Blood"" who murdered several callous theater critics in re-enactments of death in Shakespeare's plays. No, Poe is not the serial killer stalking and killing innocent victims. Beware, although ""The Raven"" gets some of Poe's biographical details correct, the filmmakers err horribly in other instances. Ironically, the poor slob cut in two by a giant pendulum outlived Poe and did his best to destroy Poe's literary legacy. The individual referred to here is Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Sadly, ""The Raven"" unravels about an hour into the narrative and McTeigue and his scribes have tacked on a finale that looks like loose threads being tied up.You can almost imagine how this formulaic thriller with gorgeous costumes and atmospheric locales came about during the pre-production phrase. Presumably, the studio picked Poe not only because he was one of America's leading literary lights of the 19th century, but also the copyright on his literature has long since lapsed. Imagine this scenario at a production conference. Studio Executive # 1: ""Let's make Edgar into an action hero like they did Sherlock Holmes?""

Finally, Studio Executive # 1 says: ""Presto, we've got the greatest hits of Edgar Allan Poe. We'll include ""The Pit and Pendulum,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" and ""The Mystery of Marie Roget.""""The Raven"" opens with some minor biographical details about Poe and his mysterious death on May 7, 1849, in Baltimore, Maryland. Typically, movies about a hero who dies are usually box office poison. Moreover, Poe is such an obnoxious fellow that you don't care what happens to him. He admits at one point, ""I've got nothing left,"" adding. ""I've used up all my tricks."" The Edgar Allan Poe that ""The Raven"" presents is an egomaniac skidding into obscurity. He is a hopeless alcoholic who doesn't have enough money to buy his next drink. Initially, it appears that he has no friends except for a pet raccoon named Carl. If all this weren't awful enough, Edgar learns he is not going to be published. Earlier, he assured a bartender that he would be living like a sultan when the newspaper published his literary criticism. Since he cannot pay for a drink, Poe appropriates a stranger's drink. Actor John Cusack strives to make this tortured, 19th century genius appear sympathetic.Predictably, the first image is that of a raven perched on a tree branch overlooking a park where our dour protagonist is sitting on a bench. Afterward, the filmmakers backtrack about a week before with a scene that looks straight out of the first ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie with Robert Downey, Jr. A madman has slashed a woman's throat with a razor, strangled her daughter, and stuff the daughter's body in a chimney. When the police arrive, they hear a key locking the door from within and have to smash their way into the room. They are genuinely puzzled because nobody else is in the room, and the window through which the suspect escaped has been nailed shut. Detective Inspector Fields (Luke Evans of ""The Three Musketeers"") arrives and figures out how to open the window. Eventually, he remembers that he read about a similar incident in the macabre fiction of Edgar Allan Poe. Fields recruits a reluctant Poe to serve as a consultant.When Poe isn't dabbling in real-life murders, he is having an affair with stunning Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve of ""Sex in the City 2"") whose father wants her to have nothing to do with Poe. Indeed, Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson of ""Safe House"") threatens to shoot Poe on sight if he catches the renowned author with his daughter. No sooner does Poe propose to Emily than the insane psycho kidnaps her and things really get out of hand. The murders in ""The Raven"" are not for the squeamish, and McTeigue earns his R-rating for bloody violence and grisly images. The pendulum scene ranks as rather graphic as the descending blade eviscerates a book critic and then gets jammed in the victim's pelvis. The problem with ""The Raven"" is that it lacks the compelling quality that a good murder-mystery requires if we the audience are to overlook some of the far-fetched plot logistics. Back to the pendulum scene. When Poe visits the scene of the crime, he is impressed by the size of the counterweight. Where could a killer—insane or not—buy a pendulum of that size and install it without attracting attention. This question and others—like the spring loaded window nails are things that shouldn't concern us. Unfortunately, McTeigue doesn't orchestrate the action with enough verve to distract us from these questions.",The Raven
17,Boba_Fett1138,A bit too simplistic all.,6,4 July 2012,"Well, not much to say about this movie really. It's not bad but it's definitely nothing memorable or impressive to watch either. It's all being good and entertaining enough to keep watching but by the end of it you won't feel like you got an awful lot out of the movie.I think that the biggest problem of the movie is that it's being a very straightforward mystery/thriller, which at the same time also makes it a very standard and formulaic one. Normally I would complain when a movie has too many distractions in it but in this case it most likely wouldn't had harmed this movie. Some more character, or some more different story lines would had perhaps made this movie a more interesting one.The movie now becomes a bit tiresome after a while. There is not enough variation and the movie just never really manages to become a tense one, with any of its mystery or thriller elements. Who knows, maybe it also was the movie its low budget that prevented it from ever making a real impact and the reason why the movie seems to be lacking the right required type of atmosphere.A problem of the movie also lies with its main character. No, I'm not saying that John Cusack is a poor actor in this movie but his character simply isn't being a good or interesting enough. There was so much they could had done, after all he plays Edgar Allan Poe in this movie but it feels as if the film-makers were holding back with just about everything and decided to play things safe, making this a very standard and therefore also predictable little movie.No it's not a horrible movie to watch but just a movie that offers far too little to its viewers.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Raven

This film tells what purports to be the story of those days, and involves the penniless and alcoholic Poe getting involved in trying to solve a string of murders and a kidnapping which appear to be based on his work.So we have a period murder mystery thriller here, with John Cusack as Poe. Poe's dialogue is obviously fairly carefully scripted, and is played by Cusack in an overly ostentatious manner which suits the floridity of what comes out of the character's mouth, but which otherwise gives the impression of bad stage acting (also I had never noticed just how much Cusack, an actor who I like, stands there with his mouth open, looking like a character from a badly drawn comic).The rest of the film is not scripted as carefully as Poe's dialogue, and much of the logic falls apart if you look at it too carefully. Superficially, however, this is an entertaining ride - rather dark, somewhat violent, but with a good period feel and decent performances from the rest of the cast.",The Raven
20,Uriah43,Dark and Somber,6,14 March 2015,"Like many artists ""Edgar Allen Poe"" (John Cusack) isn't given nearly as much appreciation while he is alive and this movie captures his plight during the time he is residing in Baltimore, Maryland just prior to his death. It is during this time that he meets and falls in love with a beautiful young woman named ""Emily Hamilton"" (Alice Eve) and hopes to marry her. Unfortunately, Alice's father ""Charles Hamilton"" (Brendan Gleeson) doesn't look too kindly on their marriage and has no intention of allowing that to happen. It is also at this time that a serial killer goes on the rampage and uses situations straight out of Poe's writings which come back to haunt the famous writer. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this film manages to capture the mid-19th century time period pretty well. It also does a good job in creating a dark and somber environment which benefits the personality of someone like Edgar Allen Poe. Yet, while this film certainly has some suspense I thought it could have improved on it to a certain degree. As a result this movie doesn't quite achieve its potential and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Raven

22,phd_travel,Interesting and clever,7,11 January 2013,This is an intricate and fascinating if slightly anti climactic imagining of the events leading to Poe's real life mysterious death. A copycat serial killer murders people a la Poe's stories and he is brought in to help solve the crimes. His girlfriend gets kidnapped by the killer.Obviously this will appeal to Poe fans. I know a few Poe's more famous stories it is quite fun to watch them appear. And it makes me want to read more of the less famous stories too.The European filming locations give 19th Century Baltimore an old world feel.John Cusack looks the part but he tends to resort to inaudible whispers and it ends up feeling like a weaker if less comical version of Nicholas Cage. The rest of the cast is mostly British with good enough accents including Luke Evans competently playing a detective on the case and Alice Eve the romantic interest for Poe.In some ways this movie succeeds because it has a more real feel than the Sherlock Holmes cases and is quite tense in parts. Where it doesn't do well is the pace drags here and there and the ending is a logical but a bit anti climactic. I can see why it wasn't a huge hit but I think it is worth a watch.,The Raven
23,Aaron1375,Nice mystery type film featuring the tortured Edgar Allen Poe.,8,23 October 2012,"I was not sure what to expect from this film, but seeing as how I could borrow it for free I would watch it. Turns out it was a really good movie as it featured a fine performance from John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe, a nice kill here and there and a nice mystery to try and unravel. I am surprised that it did not perform better at the theaters as it was a nice change of pace from all the comic book films I usually watch.The story has Edgar returning to Baltimore at a time a gruesome murder is taking place. One that seems to be a copy of his work ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"". Other heinous crimes occur, all seeming to be based off Poe's work. Poe becomes the prime suspect, but the investigator on the case soon realizes it is not the troubled author so he soon enlists Poe's help to try and find the person responsible. Unfortunately for Poe, this killer soon brings Poe in directly by kidnapping Poe's beloved and challenges Poe to find her before she dies.I liked the cat and mouse of the game as the investigator and Poe try to solve the killer's bizarre and twisted clues to learn his identity before it is too late. I was not sure what to expect from the film, but it turned out to be a very dark and a bit of a sad film. John Cusack did great as Poe, but all of the cast did a fine job. They also did a nice job of recreating Baltimore in the time period this film takes place. I am sure if I really looked I could find a mistake or two, but I never really try to look for anachronisms when watching a movie unless it is like totally obvious or the movie is not good.So all in all a good mystery type movie with some horror elements in it. The best death was a bit early in the film, it being the one that copied the Poe story ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". None of the other deaths were quite as graphic as it. However, the film's story was good enough that I did not need to see a bunch of over the top brutality.",The Raven
24,gradyharp,'You are referring to one of my stories. A work of fiction!',7,11 October 2012,"For many viewers this film seems to have been expected to be a biography of Edgar Allan Poe's life and it is obviously not that. There are many known facts about the author/poet's life and there are almost as many aspects that are not known. In this cinematic story the writers (Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare) appear to want to explore the concept of murders based on Poe's famous stories and present these mysteries as reenactments during Poe's time - Variations on themes - and when taken with that approach in mind the film works very well (despite some significant flaws in the creation of the film as directed by James McTeigue). The film captures the flavor of the times and the mixing of the stories between fiction and reality makes for an entertaining outing.Baltimore, 1849 and we find Poe (John Cusack) as a drunkard trying to get his works published by the local newspaper edited by Maddux (Kevin McNally). His devoted assistant is Ivan (Sam Hazeldine). In the midst of Poe's financial decline a series of murders occur, murders that appear to be copies of Poe's many stories, and the police (Detective Fields - the talented Luke Evans - and Captain Hamilton - Brendan Gleason) decide to engage Poe's help in solving them. As a side story Poe is infatuated with his boss's daughter Emily (Alice Eve) and when Emily goes missing Poe s determined to capture the serial killer, even making it known that he would trade his useless life to save Emily's life. The remainder of the film is a chase to the finish and along the way we learn the references to many of Poe's great poems and stories.No, this is not a great film, but suspend reality and it is an entertaining mystery movie. The cast is solid and the special effects are convincing. If the film dawdles too long over certain features it does have other saving graces. But oddly enough, the graphics and the obnoxious music chosen for the closing credits destroy the mood and make the viewer want to simply turn off the film. Grady Harp",The Raven

First of all, I do like Poe's poems and the movie is full of it but on the other hand I just didn't find it a horror. On that part it failed completely. It reminded me so much of Sherlock Holmes (2009). Okay, it do has a serial killer who likes sentences of Poe's poems but where are the killings. The only one that was worth watching is the ""Pit and The Pendulum"" murder. But if you look then you see that it was a mix of CGI and effects and from that point I was a bit disappointed. One slashing did look great but it was all too late. Still, it's worth watching for the customs and all that. But when they involved Poe in the search of the killer and the search of his fiancée it even became weirder for me. It has nothing to do with the 1963 version of The Raven also loosely based on Poe's story. There is a raven to see here in this flick doing stuff in a coffin. But it was, personally spoken, more a thriller then a horror although it was published as a horror.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Raven,8,26 April 2012,"The mystery surrounding the death of American writer and poet Edgar Allan Poe provided writers Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare with inspiration to design a narrative that built around the themes and stories of Poe, and have a go at a fictionalized account of Poe's final days, involving a serial killer inspired by Poe's writings, and challenging the writer on a personal front to solve a series of murders, and essentially serving as bait to come get him. For what it is, similar to fictionalized tales of the macabre like From Hell, The Raven contains enough just to skirt around as an alternative to the blockbuster season offerings, and it's always a welcome to see John Cusack, as Poe himself, back on the big screen.Directed by James McTeigue, The Raven races through its narrative, staying in tune to its main story where it's a race against time for Poe and Detective Fields (Luke Evans) to try and track down the identity of a serial killer taunting them with horrific clues usually made out of his victims, in fashions adapted from Poe's spectrum of Gothic stories. Not only that, a personal vendetta got thrown in as well when Poe's beau Emily Hamilton (Alive Eve) got kidnapped, and solving the series of clues will lead to her whereabouts, with death a whisker away if they dilly-dally. With V for Vendetta and Ninja Assassin filled with violent action scenes, McTeigue toned it down a little in The Raven, while still containing dark themes and settings, offers the same amounts of blood but done through Saw inspired death sequences which thankfully the censors here didn't have any issues with, or may have closed their eyes when it mattered, missing everything.But the point about this film, where the villain gets inspired by the protagonist, actually felt like art mimicking life, and vice versa, where the entire look and feel of The Raven felt like National Treasure meeting Sherlock Holmes, where the characters have to rely on intuition and their deductive abilities in order to race around the city of Baltimore (with Serbia locales doubling up for a very period looking city), filled with sufficient red herrings to keep you guessing until it let the cat out of the bag by an intentional dwelling of a scene that you will go, Ah-Ha! Even John Cusack, one of my favourite actors, looked quite like Nicolas Cage with his receding hair-line and goatee, with expression probably gleaned from watching too many Cage films. And speaking about derivative, here's not forgetting Alice Eve doing her best rendition of Ryan Reynolds in Buried as well.Knowing what to expect with The Raven delivering as promised, the film moves on an even keel with excitement brought about by relentless pursuits given the unnamed and unmasked villain almost always being so close to getting caught, but successfully giving our heroes the slip, adding to the suspense and build up. Luke Evans as the proud detective also fit into the role and shared a great chemistry opposite Cusack, as one realized that Poe is probably going to be an asset given his intimate knowledge of the characters and settings he created in the novels that the killer is following almost to the letter.It doesn't boast as much fight action sequence as Sherlock Holmes as this is more of a demonstration of brains over brawn, but does have its fair share of gory and creepy moments, with cadavers aplenty, with excellent makeup highlighting the grotesque and the morbid. The closing credits though deserve a mention, with stylized graphics and Unkle's Burn My Shadow playing in the background in what I thought was a fitting wrap for an exhilarating adventure ride where we get an imaginary peek into the personal style of a literary giant, his body of works, and pitting him against the bane of creative talents like himself - the plagiarizer with zero originality.

Perhaps, although I can't find a clear fault in it. Some of the sophistication of the crimes and of the investigative methods were clearly out of the era, but overall it was OK. The production values were good, the direction was good, the acting was good. The atmosphere was dark and claustrophobic as in Poe's writing. Yet, I didn't quite find the enjoyment I was looking for.The only thing I can think off was John Cusack. He and Alice Eve had no chemistry (and how can you not have it with Alice Eve?!) and the thing I had most trouble believing were not the way the criminal always barely escapes, not the story or the era or the feel of the movie, but that Cusack's character had any feelings at all.

But the execution wasn't that great, but it's a good effort. And is worth seeing at least once. The plot is about Edgar Allan Poe(John Cusack) who is portrayed in a very arrogant character who is also a drunkard on the trail with Inspector Emmett Fields(Luke Evans)to catch a killer that kills people in the same manner it's told in Poe's stories. Now this might be a interesting premise but it goes in a pretty one dimensional direction without pulling hardly any major twists. The killer keeps giving the trackers clues and they follow that clue and that formula is used over and over again. This would be okay if it didn't go in such a narrow direction to the point it gets dull after a while. It got my attention sometimes but got bored easily a lot as well. John Cusack as Edgar was alright but it seemed like he didn't really care about his role that much. Luke Evans is good in this and his emotions really pour out and makes his desperation to catch the killer believable. The motives of the killer and who the killer is made is the main driving factor of this movie and not how Poe's stories got incorporated in this movie in a creative and imaginative way. Which is the main disappointment for this flick. I got the motive of the killer pretty early on but was hoping there would be more to it, but there wasn't. It's a okay detective style movie but nothing much you probably seen in this type of genre. On the plus side I did like how they mixed reality with fiction although there is way more fiction in this.5.9/10",The Raven
31,Hellmant,The sum of the parts is definitely greater than the whole.,6,28 November 2012,"'THE RAVEN': Three Stars (Out of Five) John Cusack plays legendary writer Edgar Allan Poe in this fictional account of his last days alive in 1849. In this story a killer is imitating Poe's most famous macabre work and it's up to Poe and a Baltimore detective (played by Luke Evans) to stop him. The film was written by actor turned film writer Ben Livingston and writer Hannah Shakespeare. It was directed by James McTeigue (who also directed the stylistic action films 'V FOR VENDETTA' and 'NINJA ASSASSIN') and co-stars Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson. The movie is somewhat interesting but never delivers quite enough thrills or emotional involvement to make it really memorable or worthwhile.As the story opens Poe (Cusack) is a poor alcoholic and a shell of the man he once was; constantly struggling to get his work published in the Baltimore paper. He's in love with Emily Hamilton (Eve) and plans to marry her but her father, Captain Hamilton (Gleeson), wants his daughter to have nothing to do with him. When the Baltimore police find a grisly murder scene that resembles the killing from one of Poe's stories Poe is brought in for questioning. When the killer continues to murder victims in ways that seem influenced by Poe's short stories and poems Poe teams with the detective in charge of the case, Detective Fields (Evans), to stop him. Things become especially intense when Emily is kidnapped by the killer.Unlike some I like the idea of revolving a fictional murder mystery around Edgar Allan Poe's literature and casting Poe as it's lead character. Cusack is especially good as Poe and the rest of the cast is adequate but the characters aren't ever really that fascinating or likable. I do like McTeigue's stylish directing and the murder scenes and atmosphere are nicely done but the story as a whole is lacking. The action for the most part works but by the film's conclusion there's definitely something pretty unsatisfactory about the film going experience as a whole. In the case of this move the sum of the parts is definitely greater than the whole.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD9BHpPUnE8",The Raven

Financially it certainly did but that doesn't always dictate what makes a good movie. The movie combines elements of mystery, thriller, horror and action. At times it has a Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes feel to it, and it is certainly dark, twisted, gritty and just fun. It is obviously taking a fictional turn to a very real person (Edgar Allen Poe) but it also really tries to weave its story into the real facts about the legendary writer. It doesn't insult his memory or his work but rather shows Poe as a troubled, tortured soul but someone with emotion and imagination and I think even a desire to find retribution for things he believes he has done wrong in his life. The film did not do well in theatres and I can sort of understand it. It is not a stone cold mainstream thriller, it has a different feel to it but I think in a good way. It's slick and intelligent with great ambiance and a very sold lead performance.I have always liked John Cusack. In some ways I think he's struggled to be the lead actor, the Hollywood heavyweight, but I think he has great charisma on screen and he nailed the role of Poe. He made him such a believable and empathetic character. I kept thinking I recognized Luke Evans but it turns out I didn't but he did a fantastic job as the investigating detective. I thought he was even a little underused and I thought the buddy cop chemistry between him and Cusack was really good but unexplored. This is the second movie in a week that I've watched with Alice Eve (the first being ATM.) I think Alice Eve is stunning, just a beautiful woman and I love her for that but the girl never seems to really impress in a role. She just looks pretty and smiles and really never shows any true acting talent. She is a bit of an odd choice for Poe's love interest and she isn't terrible but she falls short of the rest of the cast. Brendan Gleeson is also terrific in a small role as Alice Eve's father.Director James McTeigue hasn't had a lot of experience as the main man behind the camera but what he has done has been excellent. He has an amazing knack of creating a brilliant scene and setting like V For Vendetta and yes even Ninja Assassin and now The Raven. Perhaps he needs a little more experience in really bringing out the most in the story. However, for its few mis-steps the film is really an excellent thriller. I was even surprised (I didn't realize it was R rated or 18A for Canadians) at the level of gore at the crime scenes and some of the really twisted ideas in the film. I was only slightly disappointed at one particular torture scene that was literally lifted right from a Saw movie but I can overlook that easily. Definitely worth checking out for a different sort of Halloween flick. 8/10",The Raven
33,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Elementary, my dear Edgar.",7,31 July 2020,"'The Raven (2012)' is absolutely ridiculous, a story in which Edgar Allan Poe hunts down a killer whose crime scenes bear an uncanny resemblance to the author's own work, but it's undeniably a fair amount of fun. It's by no means a biopic, rather a sort of cinematic fan-fiction that re-imagines its main player as the kind of character he would write in one of his own stories. Thankfully, he isn't transformed into some sort of superhero; he very much feels like a fish out of water. He's an arrogant alcoholic haunted by his past, which is somewhat unconventional and yet entirely at home in a narrative such as this. That narrative is occasionally strained and even sillier than its premise suggests, but it's intriguing and enjoyable equally as often. Its tone is slightly too dour (especially in its odd, aesthetically jarring main-on-end credits sequence) and it sometimes seems as though it takes itself too seriously.

Edgar Allan Poe is found delirious on the Baltimore streets on October the 3rd 1849. Few days later he passed away and to this day we know nothing about his last days or cause of death. In interesting way this movie uses fiction to fill this hole in Po's biography, making it more convincing by using some authentic details.

The script, plot outline, the acting, and presentation are consistent, appealing, and captivating in their portrayal of a complicated man who demonstrates great passion and devotion as well as a layered character not always agreeable, sometimes bittersweet in its consequences and those are perhaps reasons this movie didn't really set all that well with a majority of the audience members.Nevertheless, this mystery thriller incorporates the highest of human character and ultimately and convincing period mystery film with both heroism of both sexes, and a fiendish, intelligent villain along with a poetic narrative that almost sings with sublime literary prose, very unusual for film nowadays. This movie has the substantive density of Leo DeCaprio's more contemporary atmospheric mystery thriller of Shutter Island (2010) and the tantalizing sadistic teasers of Along Came A Spider (2001) and The Bone Collector (1999). It captures the heart of the superlative crime mystery thriller The Lovely Bones (2009) or the queasy, unsettling sensation arising from Gone Baby Gone (2007). However, this movie seems to have more in common with the crime thriller classic, Se7en (1995) with its parallels in the insidious nature of the villain and the efforts to capture him along with a twisted ending.",The Raven

39,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,6,16 January 2015,"The writer of murder stories finds his novels being the inspiration of a serial killer and so he cooperates with the police to find him. Dark and thrilling, the film is not showing too much blood (which is good, the scenes with the murdered bodies are enough) but it does approaches the terror on a more psychological level. Poe is sarcastic and sensitive at the same time, fighting for his love and his place in the society. That's why I thought that he was presented brilliantly, even though some time he reminded me of Sherlock Holmes. So, the performances were good, almost excellent, as well as the whole atmosphere of Gothic, that almost imitated the vampire movies in the Dracula era. However, at some points I felt that the script didn't support the rest of the movie and that some things were overstretched. That's why I give the raven a six.",The Raven
40,leonblackwood,Quite Watchable!,5,4 August 2012,"Review: I quite enjoyed this film because it was full of suspense, betrayal and intrigue. It reminded me of the classic who-dunnits, with a touch of Sherlock Holmes. The storyline was well put together but I couldn't help thinking that it would have been a bigger film if they had someone with a bit more screen charisma in the leading role. Its not that John Cusack doesn't put in a good performance, its just that he seems to act the same no matter what project he is doing. Luke Evans was an excellent choice as the detective and they should have used Brendan Gleeson a bit more. Watchable!Round-Up: The whole period drama/love concept of the movie didn't play a massive part in the plot which was great. The director done a good job with capturing the period and putting together enough suspense that keeps your glued to the screen until the very end. The only problem is that there is so many movies covering the period drama genre at the moment, which is why this movie might get over looked. Budget: $26million Worldwide Gross: $22.5millionI recommend this movie to people that like there period drama/suspense/horror movies with nuff blood. 5/10",The Raven
41,BeneCumb,"Rather good... Thanks to John Cusack, above all",7,2 February 2013,"The plot has several good moments and logically explained events, but, in general, is rather uneven, with some protracted scenes not providing additional value to the movie. Luckily, there is more crimes and less mystery, no voices in the forest or inside heads or so (personally, I do not find it thrilling to follow someone's going or being mad). As for the cast, John Cusack + British actors give pleasant performances; well, males mostly, I did not like female characters too much. Anyhow, the movie does not become boring and the ending has several layers as well, although you could guess the fate of Edgar Allan Poe.Additional points as I did not guess who the guilty one was.",The Raven
42,freemantle_uk,A noble attempt,5,27 April 2012,"There have been many fictionalised film accounts of historical figures lately. Last year we learned ""the truth"" about William Shakespeare in Anonymous and we will soon see Abraham Lincoln battle vampires in Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Now we have the fun of John Cusack hamming it up as Edgar Allen Poe in the Gothic mystery The Raven.In 1849, Poe is a penniless writer who enjoys a drink. He is unable to pay his bar tab and struggling to even get published in the Baltimore Patriot. He is also about to be engaged to the very beautiful Emily (Alice Eve) against her father's (Brendan Gleeson) wishes.Then murder most foul stalks the streets of Baltimore when a killer starts using Poe's stories as inspiration. A young police detective, Inspector Emmett Fields (Luke Evans), is in charge of the investigation and recruits Poe's help. But the stakes are upped when the killer kidnaps Emily and demands that Poe write about his murders if he wants to save Emily's life.The Raven is the first film to be made by James McTeigue without the Wachowski Brothers. He showed promise with V for Vendetta but dipped when he directed reshoots for The Invasion as well as the action film Ninja Assassin. With The Raven, McTeigue attempts a Tim Burton-style Gothic horror mystery within a historical framework, but it comes off more as a cross between the Hughes Brothers' adaptation of From Hell, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes and the Doctor Who episode ""The Unicorn and the Wasp."" McTeigue shows signs of an action-film hangover; CGI bullets fly in air, CGI blood splatters in your face and the killer in his cloak and hat looks very much like V and is capable of extraordinary physical feats. He does give us a visually striking film that is rich in a period detail with a dark look throughout. The Raven is a very fast-paced film that does not allow boredom to settle in, but it is too stylised for its own good.As a story, The Raven could easily have been set in the modern day — it nothing from its 19th Century setting. It could have easily have been a movie about a crime novelist who is jaded or struggling for inspiration and a serial killer who uses his/her stories to conduct crimes. That is just a possibility. The idea of using Poe and his poems is more a way of giving the movie more legitimacy and they are recognisable stories, even to people who have not read them.Cusack is entertainingly bad in The Raven, giving us an over-the-top, Nicolas Cage-esque performance. He is wonderfully miscast as Poe, a man who is meant to be grief-stricken, confrontational and a romantic. He's also intelligent with Sherlock Holmes levels of deduction. He has little chemistry with Eve and Evans was his opposite, giving a very understated performance. Generally the whole movie was miscast.There are moments of unintentional comedy in the movie as well. Sometimes it is from Cusack yelling in full literary speaking mode, other times it's the police's willingness to use violence or the killer's near superhuman abilities. These moments, topped with Cusack's performance, make The Raven surprisingly entertaining in a way that the filmmakers likely did not attend.It is obvious that McTeigue and the writers were trying to make their own version of Sleepy Hollow, but it ended coming across more like From Hell. It is not a terrible movie, but it's at least watchable — more of a noble failure then anything else.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",The Raven
43,JoeB131,"Spoke the Raven, Nevermore...",7,11 November 2012,"Okay, this wasn't ""Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" awful.It's a period piece movie with a famous historical figure in it. This was actually sort of plausible. Someone is killing people using methods found in the works of Edgar Allen Poe, who is down on his luck at that point in his career. A clever young detective figures it out and enlists Poe to find the killer.Meanwhile, the killer kidnaps Poe's fiancé, and this becomes the typical race against time plot.The ending is predictable. I figured it out about ten minutes before the characters did.Still, the movie looks great, there are great homages to Poe's stories (and I was familiar with more of them than I thought I was) and for the most part the story kind of works. The period costumes are pretty good as well.",The Raven
44,Fluke_Skywalker,Watch 'The Raven' nevermore,5,22 November 2014,"Director James McTeigue's 'The Raven' re-imagines the last few days of Edgar Allan Poe's life as a 'Se7en' style thriller, and for a while at least it almost works. Even at nearly two hours the film is briskly paced and lead actors John Cusack (As Poe) and Luke Evans do their best to lift the material. Unfortunately the film rapidly collapses under the weight of its half-baked mystery. Had the eventual identity of the killer and his motives not been so completely underdeveloped and out of left field, this still might have warranted a weak recommend. But the reveal is so head-scratching that all that I could do is shrug and then sit down to write this review before the details of this waste of time evaporated from my memory.",The Raven
45,Lechuguilla,Poe's Last Days,7,7 September 2014,"A madman commits grizzly murders using techniques and strategies devised by Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack), as expressed in his published writings. Poe himself becomes a suspect, as Detective Fields (Luke Evans) tells Poe: ""your imagination is the inspiration of a horrendous crime"". To which Poe responds: ""Is imagination now a felony?"" The story is set in Baltimore during the mid-nineteenth century.The plot consists of the police reacting to various murders, and trying to catch the killer in different settings that include a masked ball and the tunnels of Baltimore. This is very much a whodunit movie, with clues sent by the killer to Poe and Detective Fields. Although the killer is present in mundane scenes, the suspect pool is fuzzy and not well defined.Poe is, of course, the central character, a person who sees himself as a literary intellectual. But he's arrogant; he's much impressed with his mental capacities; and he resents criticism. He's also very much infatuated with a young woman named Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve). With the exception of Emily, those around Poe don't much like him.The film excels at mystery. Tension is high in those scenes wherein the cops are in close proximity to the unknown killer. There is some gore, but I would not place this film in the horror genre. One problem with the plot is that the killer's identity is revealed too soon, followed by a way too strung out, anticlimactic ending.Visuals are appropriately dark and dreary, so much so that it's hard to identify characters in some scenes. Colors are highly muted and lighting is low contrast. Production design and costumes seem authentic for the story's era. Background music is eerie at times but also somewhat manipulative. John Cusack gives a really fine performance as Poe. Other performances are acceptable.The point of this fictional film is a rendering of the famous poet's last days. In the process, viewers are offered a standard whodunit story. ""The Raven"" seems more Sherlock Holmes than Poe. But that's okay with me, as I am very fond of murder mysteries.",The Raven
46,dworldeater,"Murder, mystery and John Cusack as the man in black",7,9 December 2013,"John Cusack goes goth in this heavily stylized suspense thriller. Set in mid 1800's Baltimore, Cusack is legendary horror author Edgar Allan Poe. EAP works with police to catch a serial killer that imitates Poe's literary work and the killer took his woman too. The Raven plays much more like a dark comic book than anything that could happen for real. The Raven is very well shot, very Gothic and very stylized. The sets they built look good and balanced practical and digital f/x well. Performances are pretty solid for the most part. Cusack carried this film as the lead and did a good job I think. The murder scenes are grisly at times, but most of the focus is on story and style. As far as the thriller genre goes, there are a lot of better films. Overall, I dig The Raven.

The Raven finds Edgar Allen Poe become involved in a series of murders based on his books. This is basically the pilot episode of Castle, but it goes on for a lot longer and takes itself so damn seriously. Cusack is fine as legendary poet and writer. His earlier scenes show his frustration and ego in full force as he berates fellow writers and the ignorant masses that fail to recognise his work. The period setting is brought to life well, and the Gothic nature of Poe's prose is well realised aesthetically. The problem is a lack of involvement. I didn't feel for Poe's relationship with Emily, which meant the whole sense of danger and fear was nowhere to be found. I couldn't care less who the killer was, nor his motive. There was nothing I hadn't seen before and the supporting cast are paraded around as possible suspects.I hope McTeigue can do more for The Wolverine.",The Raven

But at the end this movie only feels like a 19th century rendition of another murder copycat movie. Nevertheless the movie is nicely directed and it felt like a nice fast paced mystery thriller. The movie nicely puts the focus on the real world and let the rhyme and poetry stood as the sweetener and not pollutes the movie too much. This keeps the suspense mood flowing, as I only recall one moment of romance with slow pace within the movie. The acting overall is a decent job. John Cusack nicely portrays a drunkard has-been-someone writer who's forced to see his stories become reality. Luke Evans nicely balances Cusack's performance.

49,p-stepien,"Murderous tidings, poetry aside",5,27 August 2012,"Mid 19th Century Baltimore was the resting place of the famed poet Edgar Allen Poe. Best known for his dime a dozen horror stories of unrivalled depth, darkness and literary brilliance, Poe was an astounding poet with his masterpiece ""The Raven"" still revered. Thrown back in time we venture with the renowned American writer into the final days of his life, full of mystery and unresolved secrets. Unfortunately these are used to whip up an absurd slasher scenario focused on a pretentious copycat killer, who imitates murders perpetrated in Poe's books and in true Zodiac fashion attempts to lead the police along. Poe is called in as an expert to unravel the mystery, as he best has in depth knowledge of his own writings.Manically reminiscent of the underrated, albeit flawed, ""From Hell"" (partly due to similar themes and time periods, but also due to the contrasting of worlds of haves and havenots) James McTeique takes the dubious script and attempts to eke out the best from his actors and the material. Historical accuracy thrown out the window with this purposeful dilution of the past through movie gimmickry ""The Raven"" is an entertaining, if unremarkable affair. Eerie, albeit often overly gory, scenes depict the mysterious sensual terror of Poe's stories and several moments seem to be a perfect picture of various descriptions richly portrayed by the master. Nonetheless any credibility is beheaded by the guillotine of standardised plotting, a derivative villain and automated solutions. Despite these misgivings John Cusack comes out admirably with his slightly troubled, shuttering Poe. Nonetheless after reading several of Poe's books it would seem that he is deserving of a much more unconventional nightmarish homage of Lynch-type madness, instead of this simplistic whodunnit carnage thriller without real heart.",The Raven
50,brando647,Shallow and Disappointing; Edgar Allan Poe Deserves Better,5,20 January 2013,"Well, here was a misfire. THE RAVEN is another one of those films where I should have listened to the critics. But, come on, the premise was cool and it's not often that John Cusack disappoints. Plus it was directed by James McTeigue, the man behind V FOR VENDETTA. How did this turn out so poorly? I remember having read reviews for it but I never actually seeing it arrive in theaters. I guess I know why now. I don't know a whole lot about the life of Edgar Allan Poe but I do enjoy his stories. This wasn't enough to find anything to love about the movie. This is throwaway entertainment at best, though entertainment might be too strong a word because I was pretty bored. The movie is a mystery/thriller based around the details leading to Poe's mysterious death in 1849. Poe is a penniless alcoholic scratching for booze money from his apathetic editor who wants nothing more than another macabre tale to capture his readers' attention (and money). Meanwhile, Poe is courting the daughter of a powerful man with a hatred for the alcoholic vagabond. When Baltimore is haunted by a serial killer who draws his inspiration from Poe's tales, the author is approached by Detective Fields to act as a consultant in hunting the murderer. Soon, the investigation turns personal for Poe when his beloved Emily is taken captive and they must work against the clock, following clues to find her before she becomes the killer's final victim.THE RAVEN is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Guy Ritchie's SHERLOCK HOLMES franchise. It fails. Whereas Ritchie's movies are fun, exciting (if loose) adaptations of the source material, McTeigue's movie is boring and formulaic. It just drones on from one scene to the next, connecting the dots to a conclusion that I just didn't care about. I realized the reason a lot of the tension fizzles is because the movie continues to cut away from the investigation to Emily and her captivity. Maybe if we weren't constantly reminded that Emily is alive, there would've have been a bit of suspense as Poe and Fields race to save her life. ""Will they save her? Will she die before they can stop the murderer? Oh wait, there she is. Nope, she's fine."" Then there's the matter of the final reveal of the culprit. I'm not going to reveal their identity here for those out there who are interested in the movie, but I was pretty disappointed. To be honest, I didn't even recognize the person at first. I had to think back and remember if I'd seen them in the movie before that point. There are no clues or pieces for the audience to try and solve the case in their own minds, it's just: here's a bunch of brutal murders andhere's the killer. Surprise! The murders themselves are mildly interesting, particularly the scene drawn from Poe's ""Pit and the Pendulum"". The violence loses some of its edge due to the shoddy CG that fills out the movie. Nothing looks genuine. In 2011, Roland Emmerich used CG to create expansive shots of Elizabethan era London for his film ANONYMOUS and it worked great, but McTeigue tries the same technique for 19th century Baltimore and it falls flat because it looks fake.Speaking of fake, let's chat about the cast. I love Cusack but he was sorely miscast as Poe. From the very beginning, he never really disappeared into the character and always came off as John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe with a hint of Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes. As much as I enjoy Cusack, I'm not sure he's the right person for any sort of period piece. Throw him back in the hot tub time machine and let someone more appropriate tackle a role like Poe. Luke Evans is Poe's partner in the investigation, Detective Fields. Fields is a dull character with nothing defining about him with the exception that he's intelligent and all business. Good for him, but it doesn't make for the most exciting character. Alice Eve is beautiful as Emily and Brendan Gleeson is probably the best in the cast as Captain Hamilton, Emily's father and ardent Poe hater. Shallow characters in a shallow movie. That about sums up THE RAVEN. It's a forgettable experience that had a hard enough time capturing my attention while I was watching it. If you're looking for a thriller but don't really want to have to put any thought into the experience, THE RAVEN might be what you want.",The Raven
51,bob-rutzel-1,"Clever, but give me a break",7,10 October 2012,"In 1849 in Baltimore, Maryland, serial murders lead Detective Fields (Luke Evans) to believe there is a viable connection with Edgar Allen Poe's (John Cusack) stories. Poe is enlisted to help solve the mysteries. Let's see: Hollywood made Sherlock Holmes an action hero; they twisted the Snow White fairytale; and now they have Edgar Allen Poe running around like a detective helping to solve the murders aligned with his stories; and trying to find Emily (Alice Eve – extremely beautiful btw), his girlfriend, who was kidnapped during all this. OK, this is all clever, but give me a break. What's next? Finding out the Three Little Pigs were really the original Three Stooges? Hollywood just doesn't know what to do with itself these days. Continuing onwardI almost shut this down in the beginning as they had alcoholic Poe running around like an obnoxious A-hole fighting with everyone and you could tell Mr.Cusack was enjoying this over-acting bit. Things settled down when police detective Fields asks for Poe's help. Then it turned into a regular story. We hardly know anything about Edgar Allen Poe and the way they made everything come full circle to his death was very clever. Have to give them that. In the beginning they tell you, on screen before the story starts, that Edgar Allen Poe died in 1849 on a park bench, and that is all true. But, the cleverness in here is what happened before that. Most assuredly not true, but clever indeed. Overall, pretty good once you get past Poe's obnoxious behavior in the beginning, and yes, there were too many scenes that needed a light bulb turned on to allow us to see what was happening, but I am being picky. The acting all around is good. This was still the horse and buggy era so no car chases, but no chases on horseback either. Bummer. You probably won't be able to tell who the murderer/abductor is. I didn't. Kind of a reach, but still clever. There were clues, but they didn't help me. Will they help you?So now Hollywood is going after real life figures and not content to demolish our beloved fictional characters. Who's next? Jules Verne? Hmmmgive me a break. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Gore: Yes, and you may want to turn your head away. I did. Language: Some soft stuff and not much of that.

52,tomsview,The raving and the riven,7,5 December 2013,"This is a clever, well-made movie, but I think there are a couple of things that stop it from being better than it is.The story is not dissimilar to David Fincher's ""Seven"", in that case it was killings inspired by the seven deadly sins while in ""The Raven"", a serial killer creates gory scenarios based on the stories of Edgar Allen Poe.Inspector Emmett Fields, played by Luke Evans, while investigating a bizarre double murder, realises that it has a connection to a story by Edgar Allen Poe. He engages the author to help him find the killer. Poe, played by John Cusack, is hesitant at first, but soon throws himself into the hunt, forming an alliance with Fields.The killer's true intentions become a little clearer when Poe's Fiancée, Emily, played by Alice Eve, is kidnapped. Kept in a coffin, she is tormented by her captor. Eventually, Poe works out who the killer is, and strikes a deadly deal in exchange for Emily's life.I think John Cusack struggles to find the right balance for Poe. Admittedly, he is more settled in the role by the end of the movie, but he knocks it off balance with some early drunk scenes with lots of yelling; actors portraying people who are drunk are almost as annoying as people who are drunk. His performance is uneven, especially in his affection for Emily - he seems oddly unconvincing in some scenes although he says he would sacrifice his life for her. Luke Evans, with a far more understated performance, steals the show as Inspector Fields.Visually brilliant, the film features ever more elaborate techniques to dispose of the killer's victims, The ingenuity and the amount of work involved would have required a crew the size of the one that built the Panama Canal, however, with a movie such as this, suspension of disbelief definitely helps with the enjoyment level.For a while, I thought the identity of murderer was going to be either a disappointment or far too obvious, simply because not too many characters are introduced into the story; an unwritten rule of crime movies is that no one is introduced into a plot without reason. My fears were groundless; the ending works brilliantly, and is far more satisfying than is often the case.Although ""The Raven"" has similarities to ""Seven"", it doesn't have the darkness or the hide-behind-your-finger's tension of that masterpiece of horror. With that said however, as serial killer movies go, ""The Raven"" is definitely a 'cut' above the average.",The Raven

The movie's a very conventional mystery thriller with Poe narrating his thoughts, fears and hopes. What disappoints the most is an Edgar Allan Poe narrated in this flick who might have been any other poet. In fact this film displays anything but a superficial interest in Poe's prose.

56,napierslogs,Poe's literary roots still shine through the action-influenced detective story,7,3 May 2012,"A merging of the life of Edgar Allan Poe, his poetry, the crimes of his stories and a woven, fictional tale of all of the above is ""The Raven"". In the opening minute, I was ready to knock the film down for missing some of the significant details of The Murders in the Rue Morgue. Except this film isn't trying to faithfully recreate anything, you just have to get interested in a Poe-based detective story.Yes, it is fairly gruesome. Perhaps more blood and violence than you would typically find in a Poe story, but as the newspaper editor insisted, that's what the people want. That's likely true, but what I like about Edgar Allan Poe's writing is the intelligence, prose and soulfulness that would be hiding amongst all the murderers and dead bodies. Most stories can be deduced to be about something entirely other than just the crimes. That wasn't really the case here, but that's hardly the fault of the film as they are different mediums.They might not have gotten the underlying meaning, but they did the get the true nature of Poe accurate. His gloomy, brooding obsession with death, women and alcohol. I've always been convinced of John Cusack's aptitude for this role, and contrary to popular belief, he was very good. He was more subdued than most people were probably expecting. No action stunts and no over-the-top dramatics, he just showed how words and his propensity for gin would haunt him. He delivered only a few quick lines of wit, and I'm assuming that was the issue people had. From all that I have read from people wanting Robert Downey, Jr in this role, I'm assuming they have confused the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes with the real-life writer of Poe. All that I can say to that is thank God Cusack never got confused.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has credited Poe as inspiration for the creation of his famous detective. I'm afraid the filmmakers have tried to re-pay the favour and took some action cues from the recent movies. Watching bullets fly through the air really takes away from the few things they did so well.""The Raven"" is a good watch for Poe fans with references to many of his stories and poems and they found great moments to include some of his illustrious and lasting lines. Although I would have liked it more if the movie was just a dramatic recreation of his famous poem, at least Cusack did offer a reading of The Raven which probably mirrored that of Poe himself.",The Raven
57,brchthethird,Style over substance,6,14 November 2014,"Despite a rather convoluted and forgettable murder mystery, THE RAVEN has some decent production values, satisfactory (if slightly overdone) acting and is entertaining as speculative historical fiction. The premise of the film is that these are the final days of Edgar Allan Poe as he assists a young police detective in catching a serial killer who patterns his crimes after Poe's stories. The story works in fits and starts, with each murder ostensibly bringing Poe closer to the unknown killer. Basically, a whodunit. John Cusack does a great job of inhabiting this fictional version of Poe, although a lot of his dialogue (and most of the dialogue really) is laughable. Luke Evans is the only other actor with a substantial role, and he does a decent job, too. However, the main reason to see this movie is the director, James McTeigue. Better known for being the assistant director of the Matrix trilogy, as well as his own solo efforts V FOR VENDETTA and NINJA ASSASSIN, he brings a similar style to this movie, although it's significantly toned down. There are a few moments of graphic violence (augmented by CGI blood) and one ""bullet time"" moment, but for the most part he goes for a grim atmosphere as opposed to over-the-top style. Being that this is a period piece, I thought that the recreation of 1840's Baltimore was pretty good, and the limited color palette worked in the film's favor. The score was also passable, although nothing really spectacular. If anything, this film feels painfully ordinary when considering the talent involved. Still, it is rather entertaining and isn't quite as bad as you might think it to be.",The Raven
58,JvH48,Confusing scenario requires a 2nd viewing. Problematic usage of two E A Poe stories,5,17 November 2012,"This film was part of the Imagine film festival (SF/fantasy/horror) Amsterdam 2012. By accident I saw it two times in the same week, once as a Sneak Preview (film title kept secret until the last moment), and a few days later as member of a larger group with ""normal"" tickets (could not find a volunteer to take my ticket). In both cases I failed to pick up the atmosphere (gas lanterns, carriages and horses), being a certified nerd who does not ""get"" such things as feelings and moods. But the worst problem was that my remembrance of the underlying E A Poe stories stood in the way, elements of which were used wrongly, in a manner that was probably not (I dare to say: certainly not) intended by the original writer.Anyway, I was also most unimpressed the first time due to confusing plots and characters. The second time I could lean back and glue the kaleidoscope of scenes together, and was thus able to appreciate (a bit) more what was going on. Focusing on the thriller elements the first 45 minutes worked very well, with tension building up, wondering where all this was heading. But then the illogicalities started. One example: The first viewing left me at a loss why the woman main character was not killed instantly, contrary to what happened with all victims before her. Not until the second viewing, the reasons behind this difference became clear.As a long time admirer of the two underlying E A Poe stories (Murders in the Rue Morgue, Pit and the Pendulum) I found that the crux of both stories was missed entirely. We saw crude extracts that only showed the obvious and superficial elements. A frivolous defender of the film makers might say that it is by design, trying to convince us that the murderer was not smart enough to grasp the fundamental themes of the two stories. I completely missed the detective's logical thinking process dependent on scraps of witness reports (Murders in the Rue Morgue), and ditto the fear element as crucial part of torture (Pit and Pendulum).Leaves me with a rhetorical question: Is it a good thing that I needed a second viewing to get all this??Anyway, someone not burdened with previous knowledge of the two E A Poe stories, may overlook their faulty adaptation. But my other problems still cannot be ignored, and I assume that many thriller lovers will have the same viewer experience. Considering casting and acting as compensating factors, a score of 5 out of 10 seems appropriate.",The Raven
59,carbuff,"Really good in theory, no so much so in practice.",6,12 August 2015,"Actually a pretty strong plot, but unfortunately a pretty mediocre execution. John Cusack's abilities (and/or aspirations) peaked quite a while back and nowadays he seems to be mostly coasting (and eating). This movie could have made some strong emotional connections, and it comes close a few times, but it never seals the deal. Instead it attempts to compensate for its failings with some unnecessarily gruesome special effects, which didn't really add anything to the movie. In this case, leaving some of the blood and gore off of the screen would probably have raised the suspense and tension, which would also have made for a better homage to the work of Edgar Allan Poe. So while this film is interesting and original enough to be worth the time, unfortunately it didn't live up to its obvious potential.",The Raven
60,petra_ste,The Tell-Tale Schlock,3,26 February 2014,"An unmitigated disaster of the ""Wouldn't it be cool if...?"" school of thought, The Raven's sole appeal lies in its deliciously cheesy, Hammer-worthy premise: the last days of Edgar Allan Poe as he investigates a series of murders inspired by his works.The only mildly interesting element in this clunky venture is John Cusack, to ponder how deadly miscasting can be even to a fine actor. A quirky performer with a markedly modern look, feel and sensibility, Cusack, saddled with horrendous dialogue and an absurdly whitewashed character (Poe's alcoholism is reduced to a zany flaw the hero has to overcome), is so flat-out WRONG for the part, his performance so miserable and lifeless, he appears to scrape against the fourth wall every time he is on screen. This is a role which called for a chameleon-like actor shamelessly hamming it up - say, Gary Oldman. Cusack plays it more or less straight and sinks with the movie and his fellow performers, including Alice Eve (pretty and terrible) and Luke Evans.As for director James McTeigue... seriously, how did this guy manage to make V for Vendetta? His work here is atrocious, an ugly thing of badly lit set-pieces.3,5/10",The Raven
61,gregsrants,The Rental,3,27 July 2012,"Truth be disclosed, we had high hopes for James McTeigue's The Raven. The story about a serial killer who is inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe suggested a Se7en meets Jack the Ripper tale and early trailers for the film had us optimistic about the result.John Cusack plays Edgar Allan Poe and he is portrayed as a struggling writer for a Baltimore newspaper who between bouts of over excessive drinking is romantically engaging Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) much to the chagrin of her father Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) who has little patience for Poe's cockery and antics.But Edgar Allan Poe's romantic endeavors have to take a back carriage seat when a mysterious killer begins to use murders as described in such Poe classic writings as The Pit and the Pendulum as his inspiration to his rampage. Detective Fields (Luke Evans) is quick to make the connection between the gruesome discoveries and Poe's literary prose and he teams with the author in an attempt to get closer to identifying the killer.Adding one wrinkle to the events is the kidnapping of Emily Hamilton. Emily is not quickly killed, but is instead buried alive and now Poe and Fields must work through various clues and the odd mistake by the film's villain.As aforementioned, much was expected from the director of V for Vendetta and Ninja Assassin. But from almost the first frame of The Raven, things go awry and the dialogue and the subsequent acting expected from the dialogue fails to lift the film towards any hint of a recommendation.First and foremost is the miscasting of the usually reliable John Cusack. Ewan McGregor was originally cast in the role (with Jeremy Renner as Detective Fields), but both dropped out of the project to pursue other projects. Cusack's accent comes and goes and his portrayal of the eccentric Poe has him more of an ass-clown buffoon whom audiences could care less suffers or survives.The killings were unmemorable save for poor Rufus Wilmot Griswold who gets cut in half by a pendulum that looks like it was rigged by the Jigsaw killer from the Saw franchise while spewing CGI blood throughout the room.The action and drama that takes place between each murder is boring and poorly written and it culminates in an ending that looks to have been test-audience approved and neither satisfies those that suffered through the 110-minute running time nor does it bring appropriate closure to the cat-and-mouse events that preceded it.The end result was such that we thought the film would be better titled 'The Rental'.",The Raven
62,witster18,All 4 people in my party rated it a 7/10,7,28 April 2012,"VERY, VERY MILD SPOILERS.It's a good movie. ""The Raven"" takes a little while to get going, but the film has some very strong characteristics and the last half is excellent.My guess is that the majority of negative reviews will harp on the films slow first 35-40 minutes, or about some historical inaccuracies(I always hate those nitpickers on the historical accuracy of subjects of which I wouldn't know what was historically accurate or not - so who cares right?) I went to see the film with my mother, step-father, and my wife. I should note: while we only gave the film a 7/10 as a group - a huge portion of the audience actually applauded at the end of a film. You don't see that very often nowadays, so I thought it was noteworthy.There wasn't much to choose from when I looked in the paper Friday morning, and seeing how I'm the family movie-buff, I was entrusted to make the final decision on the movie.Now, I wasn't dying to see this, but stacked up against options like ""American Reunion"", ""Safe"", and other ""gambles in my mind""; I thought going with Cusack and the director of ""V for Vendetta"" was the safest bet. Had I been on my own - I would have had trouble picking between ""The Raven"" and ""American Reunion"". I like Stathom, but had heard some negative reviews on ""Safe"". I also knew that I would ultimately see it as a rental.""The Raven"" is in the vein of ""From Hell"", or ""Sleepy Hollow"", and probably towards the latter in terms of quality.John Cusack is FANTASTIC as Poe, a smart, witty, drunk that prints macabre tales, but otherwise seems like a pretty nice guy. When a series of killings turn out to be re-enactments of his previous work - he is instantly a suspect.Brendan Gleeson is good(as always) as the father of Cusack's love interest, Alice Eve, and another noteworthy performance comes from Luke Evans as the detective assigned to the case.The last half of the film moves at a nice pace compared to the first half, and the audience is really drawn in to root for Poe's character.The style and direction are sharp, and there isn't much to criticize in terms of quality here - this is/was a nice production.The few grotesque scenes are very effective. Kudo's go out to the computer imaging and make-up teams for making this look extremely real.I was a bit surprised to see this ranked at 6.8 - even though that's really close to what my group rated the film. I suspect it has probably bottomed-out here. I don't expect it to go any lower. This film should hover around 7.0 by the time all is said and done.Even though I haven't seen the other films at the theater - I have the feeling this is probably one of the best options(if not the best) for a trip to the movies this weekend. It's definitely the best option for the ""adult"" crowd. Nice to see an effective film that didn't need to rely on a bunch of T&A, Mass-killings(there's only about 6 or 7 here), or over-blown CGI. I enjoyed it. It might even be worth buying and adding to the collection down the road.73/100You'll like this if you liked:From Hell(not as good as this), Sleepy Hollow(about even with this, or call me crazy I might have enjoyed The Raven a touch more!), Ninth Gate(not as good), or The Prestige(a little better).Welcome back John Cusack. Perhaps his strongest performance since 1990's ""The Grifters"", or at least 2000's ""High Fidelity"".Recommended!",The Raven
63,kuarinofu,A good yet flawed film,7,5 September 2021,"The Raven is a pleasure to the eye. The production and the atmosphere are great.It is, however, undermined by casting Cusack as Poe (and his portrayal). I like Cusack but he was clearly miscast in this.Also, while the idea of having Poe himself as a protagonist as brave as it is, wasn't the best choice here.Yet the main problem was the tone of the film. It has way too much action losing on the suspense. Even the modern-style ending credits suggest that the director saw it as an action-filled detective story when it should have been a gothic slow mystery film with stronger characters.Overall, it's a good watch, they have integrated the known facts about Poe rather well into the story, but the problems mentioned above limit the potential of the core idea.",The Raven
64,Prichards12345,"Nicely acted, probably needed a little more ingenuity and suspense to really work",7,16 September 2012,"Firstly The Raven has nothing to do with 1934 Karloff/Lugosi flick or the 1963 Vincent Price movie - John Cusack stars as Edgar Allan Poe on the trail of a serial killer who dispatches his victims according to methods used in Poe's own stories. This is a clever conceit as far as it goes, proposing to explain the mysterious last 10 days of Poe's life. It slightly reminds me of Seven and The Abominable Doctor Phibes. However here the focus is on Poe and the battle he faces against his melancholic demons as much as the mystery.Cusack is an excellent Poe, and Luke Evans as the police inspector who calls him in to help is equally good. There's sterling support from Brendan Gleeson and the film is well-shot and never less than watchable. Unfortunately the idea never quite develops as it should. After the first two murders the Poe's own murders story angle is slightly lost, and where it should be ingenious it is slightly predictable. The Pendulum death is too rushed to be effective (though it is gory) and the film's second half seems merely the familiar trope of Poe and Co rushing around after the serial killer's machinations, always second best until the very end.That's not to say this is a bad film, though; it isn't - I found it very entertaining, the actors made me care about the characters, and the whole enterprise is well worth a look. And no, I didn't guess who the killer was!",The Raven
65,nicholls905-280-546911,Guilty pleasure,7,29 October 2019,"The film has an interesting premise, but struggles with a straight forward storyline and conclusion. The first third parts of the film are strong and visually strong. Cusack is at home in the role and it's a shame the smaller budget didn't allow for more inspired story beats. This is a missed opportunity, and if it wasn't for the character's and setting this might have fallen into obscurity. I enjoy watching the film and class it in my guilty pleasure section.

66,JohnRayPeterson,Unmitigated good thriller,7,12 October 2012,"This is an unmitigated good thriller; I obviously don't agree with most critics on this one, but some user reviews I most definitely did. Considering the storyline, I expected the movie to be more about horror than mystery or suspense, like another Edgar A. Poe story related flick(did not like) I'd seen, The Pit and the Pendulum; it was not. This movie is all about mystery, suspense and thrills; the few short and slightly gruesome scenes are merely a necessity to the whole story. If you are somewhat knowledgeable about Edgar Allan Poe's career or works, and especially his death, you'll be blown away by the story that unfolds in this movie.I would describe the film as a period thriller. The costume designs and sets are very believable. The performances by the four main actors, Cusak, Evans, Eve and Gleeson, do justice to a good script and the direction seems consistent with McTeague's previous quality work.I have seen each of the previous movies directed by James McTeigue and can say that when he directs another, it will be one I'll consider watching at least because of his involvement, if not for some actor(s) I may also hold in regard for their body of work. With 'The Raven', it was a combination of both actors and director that made me consider watching it. After reading some of the more thorough and positive user reviews, my mind was made up to see it.Sam Hazeldine, in the role of Ivan Reynolds, is revealed at the end as the mysterious psychopath, the murderer of Poe, and at no point before will you suspect him; he acquits himself as well as any fiendish villain character any actor has played before, terrific.

67,Christian_Dimartino,Sherlock Poe is a lot of fun.,7,25 July 2012,"Nobody really knows what events led up to Edgar Allen Poe's death, and that is what the 2012 movie, The Raven, is trying to figure out. Well maybe not trying to figure out as much as tell us. Although what they give us is a tad ridiculous, it's also a fun premise and a movie that never takes itself too seriously.John Cusack plays Poe, and he needs money and inspiration. But he's called into action when a serial killer is murdering people according to Poe's stories. At first Poe could care less. But once they nab his woman Emily(Alice Eve), he has no other choice but to help solve the mystery.The film has a fun Sherlock Holmes kind of feeling, and even if you have a hard time accepting that Poe was trying to solve a murder mystery in his final days, you can't help but become engrossed in the occasionally grotesque but fun ride. I don't mind a good mystery, and there is no better mystery than a fiction.Cusack is up there with my favorite actors, and he does a decent job of portraying this strange man. I liked the movie. Sure it's a little ridiculous but at least it knows it on the inside. It is another interesting theory of what happened to him, and trust me, I never would've guessed it.B",The Raven
68,SquigglyCrunch,Interesting But Not As Good As It Could Have Been,6,14 November 2015,"I've had this movie sitting on my desk for a few months now, and only recently decided to watch it. I'd seen the ratings already, but it still sounded interesting. After watching it I found that I enjoyed many parts of the movie, but unfortunately it lacked in several others. The Raven had a very interesting plot. It follows a murderer who kills people in ways inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poems, which as you can imagine are pretty brutal. Most of them weren't even shown though, which I was completely fine with. Unfortunately, the plot took a turn for the worse about halfway through when romance was introduced as a driving force. I'm not saying romance is bad, but it seems like so many movies are driven solely by love these days, and The Raven just got stacked up with those movies. It wasn't poorly done, thankfully. It made more sense than I thought it would, but the unoriginality of it still took away from the experience. The characters are fine for the most part. They're interesting enough to keep you interested. The actors weren't amazing, but they were good. At times I felt like they could have been better. Some scenes I noticed were poorly shot, and I found myself rewinding the movie to make better sense of them. Even after rewinding I often found that I didn't understand what was going on or how it happened. It wasn't a major problem, but it still bothered me because I didn't know how or why certain events happened (which is kind of important). Some of the costumes, specifically Poe's costume, were a little goofy. His suit was fine, but his cape was a wee bit over the top. I really didn't see any reason for him to wear it. Maybe it was part of the fashion of his day, but considering I didn't see anyone else sporting a flowing black Batman cape I found it hard to believe that it was considered trendy back in the day. Overall The Raven was just good. The plot was interesting and relatively well-done despite it unoriginal turn. Unfortunately, this movie did suffer from its unoriginality at points, as well as poorly shot/hard to follow scenes and goofy costumes. It certainly wasn't a bad movie, and I can certainly see why someone wouldn't like it, but I thought it was just fine. In the end I would recommend The Raven, despite it flaws I found that I still enjoyed it.",The Raven
69,TheSquiss,Don't even illegally download it!,2,17 June 2012,"I really like John Cusack. He's a fine actor who's made some superb films and is vastly underused and underrated. Top of the list of Cusack's successes is Grosse Pointe Blank, a fab, funny, box-office flop that has achieved the dubious accolade of 'cult status' via DVD success. Then there's, ah, um Oh. Realization dawns. I really like John Cusack because of Grosse Pointe Blank! Oh, he was a hero for a while with Say Anything, became cool with Being John Malkovich and Pushing Tin and entertained with the likes of Con Air and Runaway Jury but actually, he's made fewer great films and displayed less versatility than, well, River Phoenix, with whom he made Stand By Me. The dead star of Stand By Me And so we come to The Raven, a film that River Phoenix wouldn't be seen de Nope. Let's stop there.Cusack stars as Edgar Allan Poe, who joins forces with a detective to catch a serial killer who's using Poe's own stories as a framework for his killings. I'm not sure that it was directed by anyone but the name on the credits is James McTeigue, the director who had more success with V for Vendetta and not much else.It's not as bad as Johnny Depp's similar and rare flop From Hell but it isn't good. No, it's bad. Very bad. It is as bad as From Hell. Don't go to see it and don't rent it. Don't even illegally download it.What was going through their minds?

70,MattBrady099,Wasn't that bad,6,4 May 2015,"Wow a 22% on Rotten Tomatoes, I know I shouldn't compare people's rating to a film but I think it was that bad.The Raven follows the tale of Edgar Allan Poe are vividly brought to life - and death - in this stylish, Gothic thriller starring John Cusack as the infamous author. When a madman begins committing horrific murders inspired by Poe's darkest works, a young Baltimore detective (Luke Evans) joins forces with Poe in a quest to get inside the killer's mind in order to stop him from making every one of Poe's brutal stories a blood chilling reality. A deadly game of cat and mouse ensues, which escalates when Poe's love (Alice Eve) becomes the next target.Before I started this review I did some research on this movie and I found out quite a lot of things about this movie and that's the stress and living hell that these film markers or who every worked on this movie faced while the budget and the production went completely wrong. This stuff always happens, I mean loads of classic and beloved movies had a lot of thing wrong with the budget or the production but it always payed off, but for this movie it didn't and while I didn't see it when it first came out because at the time was watching movies that took my interest. A week ago now I've seen the movie and to out thoughts together I can say that this movie isn't bad but wasn't that good, it's on the level of okay.John Cusack is a great actor but at the beginning of this movie was a bit over the top with him chewing up the scene and that's only the beginning, but after a while he actually began to act and for the most of the movie he did great in the role. Nothing Oscar worthy but still a solid performance and he did his best of what he can work with, if only the movie had a better script.The rest of cast like: Luke Evans, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Alice Eve and Brendan Gleeson all did a solid performance, just like I said about John Cusack there all did they best of what they got I mean it's not like they did a terrible performance well actually they were good in the movie, not the best performance but still good in a way that I let them have a pass. The cinematography in this movie looks great, every shot in the movie looked like it took forever to do in some scenes. The set, the costumes and the make-up look pretty good. The final positive thing I can say is that the movie at least doesn't look cheap like some other big Hollywood movies.Now for problems and there's a lot: The writing in the movie was pretty bland and blah, the movie also felt really short and I normally don't say that before in my reviews but I felt that the movie ended to quick and it rushed a lot of things to end it which I predict that most people wanted but for me I thought the movie may have improved in some way as it went a long but it ended just like that.The love triangle between Edger Allan Poe and Emily I didn't really care about and this is a bad thing. What I mean is that Emily is like a plot device, the whole movie is about trying to find Emily before it's too late, but here's the thing I don't care about Emily because she wasn't that development and she wasn't all that special to me, now the problem here is that the story is about trying to find her and solve the murder case, but if your movie audience doesn't care about Emily that means they don't care about the story or everything around it and they want it to be over because these nothing there to care about.Overall The Raven wasn't a terrible movie as people are making it out to be but it could have been a lot better then it was.",The Raven
71,chaswe-28402,Shakespeare wrote this ?,2,26 August 2016,"It has to be said. Nevermore. There, I've said it; and I guess the authors felt like saying it too. Why is the film titled The Raven ? The authors struggled, I guess. It must have been someone else's idea. I sat all the way through it, but I wonder why. Sometimes a film is so eye-stretching while you watch it that you can't tell if it might be abysmally brilliant. Occasionally, what you thought was appalling improves with longer acquaintance. I'm sure this is not the case here, however, which is why I'm getting in with the aptly fitting ""Nevermore"".Several reviewers have pointed out that the dialogue was wildly anachronistic. The acting was journeyman workmanlike, but not very good. The girl was sweet-looking, but spent most of her time spattered with earth, wedged between horizontal parallel planks. What had she ever seen in Edgar ? He was irremediably uncharismatic. In the end the butler did it, but there wasn't much to go on. I thought for a long time the girl's father was a possibility, because he was so unlikely. He might have been planning to stitch up Poe, the unwelcome son-in-law. Perhaps that's what I was meant to think.I found this disc sitting in my collection, but if I'd already seen it once it had totally erased itself, in every respect, from my consciousness, which shows you how unmemorable it was. Nevermore. The idea was marginally interesting, so it gets an extra star. The team that made this hybrid was stunningly cross-national. Their names covered Europe, and the never-ending end-credits made intriguing reading.",The Raven
72,lagudafuad,I have seen better,5,9 July 2012,"The best way to say this is that, The Raven was an okay thriller that will not bore you to sleep nor leave you fascinated. I will not tag this movie a success, or the best I have seen John Cusack in, but you may want to miss this.The Raven to me made a mockery of an already sad tale, Edgar Poe was not a successful poet and was a drunk, but the movie made him look more pathetic. Linking his life and death to a series of events that he somehow had a hand in, is just plain weak a script to be a movie masterpiece.The Raven is meant to depict the life of Poe after his fame after the poetry, The Raven which didn't bring any financial revenue to him. While the plot of the film is fictional, the writers based it in some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe's mysterious death. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name ""Reynolds"" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring.The plot focuses on the life of Poe (John Cusack), whose life has been drenched with negativity and death, that all his writings and story all have death and gloom all over it. But later he encounters Emily (Alice Eve), who becomes a light in his dark world. But all around him people start to die, in a way similar to what he depicts in his writings, now he and the police have to catch the killer as his light (Emily) has been kidnapped by him.Director James McTeigue, who made his directorial debut with the masterpiece V for Vendetta, did not leave a mark of greatness in this movie, as the movie lacks any memorable moment at all.John Cusack to me is not a fascinating actor, as his style of acting is similar in all his roles. Whenever he acts, he looks like same guy different script. Other actors didn't impress me either. The script is bit weak and if you are not tired you can does off.Luke Evans, was not also impressive in this movie I blame the script for that but we will get a better view of that in Hobbit and Fast and Furious 6. Alice Eve spent half her time in a box so we don't get to see more of this actress, so if you want to enjoy seeing Eve, check her out in the 2010 movie She's Out of My League.",The Raven
73,lathe-of-heaven,A tough call... Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V:10,6,29 October 2012,"Normally I don't add a review if there are so many already, but I just wanted to add a few thoughts about my overall impression. First off, I am a HUGE John Cusack fan; and the thing that I usually like about him is that no matter WHAT role he plays, he basically is always... well, John Cusack. And that is just fine. BUT, and it is a BIG BUT like Mariah Carey's... since this is a period piece and it is about a VERY well known, specific personality, I don't know, but I think that his choice to play it like he always does was not correct. I think in THIS case he really DID need actually to create another, darker, more melancholy persona...However, even with that said, I don't think that was what primarily detracted from the film. Now, overall the movie is lovely to look at and it is technically just fine and the tone is good since the director pretty much decided just to go the direct Thriller route. Okay... Personally, since it's setting is during that time, I think it would have played a LOT better if they had gone for a more Gothic look and tone, rather than giving it such an almost contemporary feel. It's like the producers got together and said, 'We want you to make another version of 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' (the one starring the excellent Robert Downer Jr.) But, considering the type of dark, tortured character and what this movie is about, I do not think that was the right choice.A good example of sort of what I mean is the bloody EXCELLENT recent version of 'THE WOLF MAN' with B Del Torro. Now THAT film was frigg'n DRENCHED in Gothic atmosphere and REALLY made you feel that you were in the setting and time with a sh*tload of mood to spare. I personally feel that if they had approached this film a bit more with that slant rather than trying to copy the slick 'SHERLOCK HOLMES', I do honestly think it would have been much more powerful and substantive.But, with that said, the director taking the film in the direction that he did, since he was either told to do so or chose to go that route, I think he still did a really decent job of putting out a quality movie that is entertaining. I just think that between Cusack's portrayal and the direction they chose to take the story detracted from what could have been a much stronger film.So, yes, somewhat enjoyable, but I feel to some degree, out of place...",The Raven
74,p-jonsson,A surprisingly good Edgar Allan Poe based thriller,7,21 August 2014,"I just happened to find this movie in the program listings yesterday. Movies based on Edgar Allan Poe can be a bit hit or miss but I like quite a few of his works so I decided to give this one a try. I have to say that it is surprisingly good. The Victorian era setting together with the rather dark plot and atmosphere makes for a very enjoyable old times thriller. The movie is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe but not in the usual way that one would think when one says based on. Instead the story in this movie is a new story spun around Edgar Allan Poe as a person where his work is used by the evil mastermind in that the various stories are re-enacted in real lifewith deadly results.I, for obvious reasons, have no idea how Edgar Allan Poe was as a person and I did not really have any pre-conceived opinions before watching this movie either. I can imagine that he, as a poet and writer of rather grisly stories, might have been a wee bit eccentric though so to me John Cusack's performance as the rather eccentric, somewhat alcoholic and sometimes almost insane but still brilliant Edgar Allan Poe was a very good one. Not that the rest of the actors are below par by any means.The story, if you take it apart and remove the parts taken from Poe's original works, is not really something to jump up and down over. However, put it together with the bits and pieces from Poe, add the characterization of Poe by Cusack, the dark Victorian ambiance and generally well implemented cinematics and you have a movie that is, as I wrote above, surprisingly good.",The Raven
75,kdnor2011,"Interesting idea, but boring execution",4,23 September 2012,"You know those Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes movies, with their memorable and funny characters, interesting, if convoluted plots, and great production value. Yeah, The Raven seems like it wants to be like those, but only get's one of those things right.I was so bored watching this, and it's a shame because the premise sounds interesting. Edgar Allen Poe must help find the culprit of a series of murders based on his stories to find his wife, cool concept ruined by bland execution. The mystery itself has a good buildup, but half way through the movie I just stopped caring. Then when they actually do reveal the culprit, all I said was, WHO? The actress who plays Emily is awful, I never believed she was afraid she was going to die. Poe seems wasted as half the time the lutenent solves everything, and even Emily seems like she could take care of herself. And it just takes itself way too seriously, it starts out pretty lighthearted, but just goes into such bleak and depressing territory that it loses any fun factor.Now it does get the visuals right. The film does look really good, it's very Gothic, has some brilliant costumes, sets, and props, it really does feel like the 1800s. Most of the acting isn't half bad, the characters aren't memorable, but Cusack and the other do a good job. And like I said the mystery was good for a while, but just got boring.The Raven is simply a missed opportunity. It looks nice and has good performances, but it's just so boring, and the mystery gets old, and even if you stay with it, it leads to a very disappointing conclusion. Not horrible, but I say just go watch the Sherlock Holmes movies.",The Raven
76,cat_ranchero,Disappointing...,5,18 March 2013,"On the plus side, it's a pretty well made film with all the technical stuff, costumes and sets done very well. On the downside, the dialogue is terrible with everyone trying to sound like they're straight from a Poe story or poem; it really didn't work for me I'm afraid. This did have one positive side effect though; it gave John Cusack the opportunity to do some excellent scenery chewing over-acting; which I found quite funny in places. Sadly it's a film that promised much but failed to deliver. I found I had no connection with any of the characters. I have not read much Poe and so I didn't get many of the many nods to his work.

77,ragingbull_2005,a waste of time and money,4,15 July 2012,"terrible waste of a terrific idea. for the un-initiated, Edgar Allan Poe was the original king daddy of horror stories. here his stories inspire a ""twisted"" imagination and the inspired killer starts to massacre people taking cues from the stories. there are problems galore. first of all the acting and the casting. this was a role which was tailor made for someone like Robert Downey Jr or even Edward Norton. John Cussack was a poor choice and he shouts and overacts his way through the movie. the script starts of well but then meanders and the ""clues"" given to Poe are stupid, mundane or so complicated that the viewer has to e intimately familiar with Poe's work to really appreciate them. much was expected from the team which contributed to V for Vendetta. but the movie is a spectacular let down.",The Raven
78,Chris_Pandolfi,When Art Leads to Madness,8,27 April 2012,"On October 3, 1849, a delirious and incoherent Edgar Allen Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore. Upon being taken to the hospital, he was reported to have repeatedly called out the name Reynolds, although he could not explain how he came to be in such dire straits. He finally died on October 7 at the age of forty. His exact cause of death has never been determined, and the death certificate and all medical records have been lost. Over the next century and a half, numerous causes have been postulated. They range from alcoholism to heart disease to syphilis to epilepsy to cholera to rabies to meningeal inflammation. Director James McTeigue and screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare have manufactured their own reason in ""The Raven,"" a crime thriller in which a serial killer draws inspiration from Poe's works.On the basis of its incredibly low Rotten Tomatoes score, I seem to be one of the few that found this film clever and incredibly engrossing. I view it not as a historical reenactment, but rather as a detective story no more preposterous in plot and characterization than one of Poe's stories. Like the author himself, the makers of this film are guilty of little more than indulging in dark fantasies for the sake of popular entertainment. In my view, they succeeded; the film is not merely a taut, complex, and suspenseful mystery but is also a triumph of art direction and cinematography, with bold colors and deep shadows populating the visual landscape. It's also a surprisingly good character study, albeit only in regards to Poe, played with terrific emotional range by John Cusack. The remaining characters border on typecasts, although considering the genre, this is appropriate.In the film, Poe is an emotionally broken alcoholic at the end of his career – a man who can't come to terms with the fact that he isn't the celebrity he should have been. His real-life status as a literary critic allows for passages of dialogue that exhibit delicious intellectual scorn. Watch early scenes in which he argues with his newspaper editor (Kevin R. McNally), and you'll know what I'm talking about; rather than compose acidic critiques of poets such as Longfellow, he repeatedly pressures Poe to resume writing gruesome horror stories, as it's well known that macabre fiction is what readers love. He finds solace in the love of his life, a young woman named Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), who thinks ""Annabel Lee"" is one of the most romantic poems she has ever read. Her father, a retired colonel (Brendan Gleeson) despises Poe on general principles and refuses to let his daughter have any contact with him. Naturally, they meet on the sly.Meanwhile, a police inspector named Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) is hot on the trail of a serial killer whose victims' fates are disturbingly similar to events described in Poe's stories. A mother and her twelve-year-old daughter, for example, are murdered in a room that was locked from the inside and had a window that was seemingly nailed shut. Fields' familiarity with Poe's work allows him to determine that the window is actually locked by a trick mechanism, one that, when triggered, would allow it to freely open. Poe is initially treated as a suspect, but in due time is brought on board as an adviser, as only he can make sense of the clues left at the various crime scenes. One of the victims meets his end in a rather gory reenactment of ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" It's determined that the victim is Poe's bitter rival, literary critic Rufus Griswold. (Note: The actual Rufus Griswold was never sliced in two, although he did passionately dislike Poe, having held a grudge against him since 1842.)Emily is kidnapped at a masked ball orchestrated by her father. At that point, every subsequent murder serves as a clue pointing to her location. As Poe and Fields desperately attempt to piece evidence together during a limited window of opportunity, we see Emily as she struggles to maintain her breathing in a very shallow coffin. Its location is not made apparent to the audience, although we do get restricted glimpses of a dark room filled with books. This is as it should be; we should be trying to solve the mystery along with the characters. Clearly inspired by ""The Premature Burial,"" this subplot allows for one of the film's most effective shots, in which the camera pans from left to right so as to reveal a cross section of the coffin.At this point, I will not describe any more of the plot, as there are twists that shouldn't be given away. I will instead turn my attention to a conversation held during the climax, at which point we delve into the unexplainable and sometimes dangerous world of fandom. In spite of the dialogue, which was at times a bit mechanical, I was blindsided by how well the filmmakers addressed a contemporary issue within the context of historical fiction. We know that art and artists can drive a person towards madness, but we have yet to fully understand why. It's precisely because of this that I believe ""The Raven"" is a lot smarter than most are giving it credit for. It's also tremendous entertainment, not only because it revels in the macabre but also because, like a good detective story, it dares the audience to play along in a game of cat and mouse.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Raven
79,davidtraversa-1,A masterpiece flawed by its very last scene.,6,21 September 2012,"What a gigantic pity! Whose idea was it to end this movie with that last scene??? No doubt it was the imposition of some gross producer whose wife had that ""original"" idea... Criminal. That's what it is. They completely destroyed a sensational film by ending it with a ""moral"" conclusion. How can it be possible already in the second decade of the XXI century to have this prudish attitude? the same one that up to the fifties (XX century) Hollywood movies would kill the ""bad woman"" at the end, because she couldn't possibly continue to live having had so much fun during the whole movie by being a ""bad woman""... I truly resent the final scene of this movie.Besides, it doesn't make any sense the way these two persons met just in the precise time and moment to conclude ""morally"" the film (I cannot make it more specific because I don't want to have any ""spoilers"" here) but it was the worst possible way to end this story.Any European movie would have ended in the previous scene before the last one that I criticize and that would've made it a mature ending, true to life, where justice rarely exists, and bad politicians, thieves and criminals of all sorts go Scot free enjoying their lives till their natural --or not-- end, but not in the hands of human laws precisely at the end of the movie, to ""please"" the audience. And when the movie ends and they show the last part of the casting, in a split second we are transported from Victorian Times to an extremely contemporary piece of visual art work with strident background music, destroying the mood so very well created from beginning to end in this beautiful movie...I tell you, somebody was planning a vendetta against the director or some actor by screwing the ending in this miserable way, there's no other explanation for such clumsiness to destroy an otherwise magnificent piece of cinema.What a terrible pity! it could have been a perfect masterpiece without those two big mistakes!",The Raven

81,gregeichelberger,Giving Poe the Doyle treatment,5,26 April 2012,"There are some good things to say about the newest film by director James McTeigue (""Ninja Assassin,"" ""V For Vendetta""), a combination of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""Saw,"" ""Sweeney Todd,"" ""Se7en"" and the latter-day Sherlock Holmes films.First, it acquaints the uninitiated with the works of Edgar Allan Poe, one of America's most creative and tortured writers. It also gives the author the Sir A. Conan Doyle treatment, bringing literary characters to life and trying to make them cool superhero modern-day detectives.Poe, while unappreciated in his time, wrote what was considered to be the first detective story (""The Murders Of the Rue Morgue""), so this tale was eagerly awaited by many fans.There is definitely a film history of Holmes and Watson going back to the 1930s, but Poe was a rather latecomer to the big screen. Until the early 1960s that is, when such films as ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (1961), ""Tales of Terror"" (1962), ""The Premature Burial"" (1962), ""The Raven"" (1963), ""The Masque of the Red Death"" (1964) and ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" (1965) were released. Most of these starred Vincent Price and were directed by Roger Corman.The newest installment of ""The Raven,"" however, is one of the first to actually tell the story of the troubled, alcoholic novelist and begins by reminding us that he was found near death on a park bench in Baltimore on Oct. 7, 1849. For years, it was assumed he died of the affects of alcoholism and exposure, but a recent investigation and documentary has fueled the possibility it may have actually been murder.The story here definitely takes one side of this argument and revolves around events during the last month of his life. While an angry, drunken, almost destitute Poe (John Cusack, ""2012,"" ""High Fidelity"") scrounges out a living writing critical reviews of other, better-known poets and authors (Longfellow, Emerson, etc.), a series of murders takes place in the Maryland city.Soon, police detective Fields (Luke Evans, ""The Immortals,"" ""Clash Of the Titans"") sees a familiar pattern: the crimes are eerily similar to Poe's stories - and the writer is a prime suspect. Once he is cleared of suspicion, however, he becomes Fields' right and man in helping to solve the killings, which reach a level of horrid gore, with throats slashed, limbs hacked, bodies cleaved in half and lips sewn together, among other niceties.Things hit home, though, when the mad person kidnaps his beloved fiancée, Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve, ""She's Out Of My League,"" ""Sex and the City 2""), in a situation straight out of ""The Masque of the Red Death."" It's now personal, so ""The Raven"" becomes somewhat of an action/adventure tale, as well.It's all a decent ride, but not nearly as exciting as the ""Sherlock Holmes"" franchise, and Cusack is no Robert Downey, Jr. (or even a Johnny Depp, who brought Icabod Crane to life in the Tim Burton adaptation of Washington Irving). He plays a convincing violent drunk, but his scenes with Evans are not very effective and there is little chemistry between him and Eve.Adding some small, but intriguing support is Brendan Gleeson (""Braveheart,"" ""The Guard"") as Emily's father, Captain Hamilton, and Kevin McNally (""Valkyrie,"" the ""Pirates Of the Caribbean"" franchise) as Maddux, Poe's perpetually ticked-off newspaper editor (are there any other kind?).The movie, though, is expected to carried by the two male leads (as Eve spends most of the time locked in a coffin, which is fine, since she could not act her way out of one, anyway), and they just barely manage to pull it off.There were a few other problems, too, including newspapers which scream with 40 column-inch headlines, ""Grisly Double Murder"" and ""Serial Killer At Large."" Anyone who knows ANYTHING about such publications in the 19th Century realizes that they were printed in vertical columns, sometimes eight to 10 across the page and the huge headlines as we know them today did not become fashionable until the 1940s.That and the fact the term ""serial killer"" was not even coined until the 1960s. Poe also drops the ""F"" bomb, which certainly did not exist as an expletive in 1849 (it was an acronym from the 1930s), and seemed to be inserted only as a nod to modern audiences (if not modern - often questionable - sensibilities).Those are minor details, I know, but when making a period piece, it is nice to actually stick to the period. As far as sets and costume design, the film is fairly accurate, which is certainly appreciated.Overall, ""The Raven"" has a few good things to offer, some drawbacks and could have been about 10-15 minutes shorter, despite the fact that it only has a one-hour, 45-minute running time. The second act drags a bit and could have used some judicious editing.That, plus the pat, predictable conclusion is an extreme disappointment. As for a sequel? Quoth this critic: ""Nevermore.""",The Raven
82,Bruce722,Surprisingly entertaining.,8,6 July 2013,"I honestly don't understand why so many critics didn't like this film as I felt it was one of the better mystery crime thrillers in years. In a very creative and well made movie, Edgar Allan Poe's stories are brought to life and Poe himself must help solve the clues and catch the killer in order to save a woman's life. John Cusack does a remarkable job in the role of Poe and the rest of the supporting cast, featuring Luke Evans, Brendan Gleeson, and the beautiful Alice Eve, are strong as well. The plot develops nicely and the movie flows at a constant pace, never dragging or growing dull. It was far from perfect being plagued by the same ""oh really"" issues that plague so many other thrillers. What I mean by that is that many of the plot points hinge on various characters' unrealistically stupid decisions and/or reactions to things. Regardless, The Raven is still very much worth watching and I found it a grippingly entertaining movie.",The Raven

If you are going to make a fictional movie about a real character I think you should really just go for it, make it original, and use some imagination. Edgar Allen Poe seems like a great character to use as inspiration for a very dark, evil, twisted movie. This wasn't one of those.Cusack as Poe, was OK, not great, not horrible but just OK. The story is one I have seen a few times before. The whole author writes something, serial killer uses it as a blueprint, suddenly the writer is called in and that was the killers plan all along and it becomes personal. Yawn.

I think the only reason it was rated R was partly the gore, but still was too light.

Still there are reviewers not rating the with the vote drop down, that gives the movie an automatic 10 rating. So much stupidity on these reviews. I say this movie was done really well, and I was drawn in it. I love horror movies with rating higher than PG-13. PG-13 horror is just light version of rated R thrillers. That is all they are.

It didn't. There is no reason that this story would be ""hidden"" from history.Whilst not criticizing the acting chops of the assembled cast, I found it impossible to engage with Cusack's dislikeable, self-obsessed, self-important Poe, or his one-dimensional bimbo girlfriend and given that their fates were in the balance throughout it didn't help.The film is dull instead of dark. The colors are gray and muted. The pace is slow. The reveal at the end is the final disappointment.I've no idea why it was called The Raven -- other than to cash in on Poe's reputation for Gothic horror. Ravens have nothing to do with anything. It's like a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp idea without either taking part. Missed opportunity IMHO.",The Raven

The villain seems super human, being able to avoid gun shots and police.There is a large plot hole. During a party, dozens of police were presence and Poe was escorting Emily yet Emily was kidnapped by one person. How was this possible? Even the movie writers couldn't figure it out, so they just simply cut away and in the next scene Emily was gone.John cusack could use more facial expression.The ending is kind of lame and feel forced.

87,dharmendrasingh,Ravenous,5,18 March 2012,"The great American literary critic and master of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe, was scarily familiar with the dark topics he wrote about. Arthur Conan Doyle suggested that Poe was single-handedly responsible for inventing detective fiction, and Jules Verne regarded him as a key influence. Poe's life story could itself inspire a film. His father abandoned him when he was young and his mother died shortly after, leaving him in the care of the Allan family, of Virginia. He eked out a living purely by writing – uncommon for his time. He could be elegant, but he was a drunk, sarcastic and didn't suffer fools. He married his 13-year-old cousin, Virginia Clemm, who died of tuberculosis at 24, causing him to sink into a deep depression. His own death, at 40, remains a mystery to this day. 'The Raven' takes place in the Baltimore of the 1840s, where people are being murdered in meticulous and macabre ways. The investigating detective, Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) recognises the killings from Poe's stories. Poe helps Fields catch the killer when his wife, Emily (Alice Eve) is the next target. As Poe, John Cusack is, at best, passable. No doubt his interpretation was carefully researched to include Poe's various characteristics, but he dwells on just two: testiness and oddness. Think of him in 'High Fidelity', but using Old English and you'll not be far off. Characters, such as Poe's wife, his father-in-law (Brendan Gleeson) and the detective are under-used for good reason: they have little to do. You'll be reminded of such titles as 'From Hell' and 'Sweeney Todd', only because this film has no higher ambition other than to blend in. It's Gothic without horror, a whodunit without suspense, a period film without elegance. I'm still trying to work out which is more absurd: Poe arguing with his editor about his material while his wife lies somewhere in a coffin, or why indeed he continues to write stories long after the killer stops murdering according to them. The raven motif is shamelessly overused, even though the film doesn't have a modicum of relevance to Poe's poem of the same name.I wasn't more impressed by James ('V for Vendetta') McTeigue's third feature because of its seen-it-all-before quality, and also because I guessed who the killer was way before I should have. Never a good omen, really. www.moseleyb13.com",The Raven
88,tbmforclasstsar,a thrill-less thriller inspired by the original master of horror,4,28 April 2012,"To be an author and to live your work must be a wonderfully surreal experience. If you're someone like, say, J.K. Rowling, to walk through a Hogwarts film set is a gift; it's the physical manifestation of your imagination, come to life before your very eyes. The same, however, may not be said if you're someone like Edgar Allan Poe.And yet, live his work is precisely what Poe must do in the new drama The Raven. Directed by James McTeigue (V for Vendetta), The Raven tells the fictitious account of the mysterious last days of famed writer and poet Edgar Allan Poe. In the film, Poe (John Cusack) becomes the inspiration for a serial killer, one who draws upon even the minutest details of the writer's short stories to stage his killings. When a team headed by a Detective Fields (Luke Evans) begins to hunt the killer, Poe, the natural expert on the recurring murders, finds himself fighting for the woman he loves (Alice Eve) and challenged by a mastermind more disturbed than he.To this day, no one really knows what caused Poe's death, or what, exactly, occurred in the last few days he was alive, and The Raven's attempt to answer those questions is, admittedly, quite creative. (I mean, what better way for the author of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" to go than chasing a deranged murderer?) In fact, screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare (ironically) attempt a tactic similar to that employed in 1998's romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love—both films try to concoct clever scenarios that might lend some insight as to what actually inspired some of the world's literary geniuses. However, while The Raven tries to paint a thrilling picture of said events, try is really all it manages to do. Unlike Shakespeare, The Raven never succeeds in executing its tale with much intelligence; neither does it do so with wit, elegance, or much subtlety.It's unfortunate that this film is bogged down by such a thinly-crafted script and rather messy direction because I found, and actually still find, the entire concept to be quite fascinating; then again, I've been intrigued by Poe for as long as I can remember. And considering who, and what, the movie is about, I found it to be more silly than scary; I mean, I'm pretty sure I laughed during scenes (and lines, especially) I probably wasn't supposed to, and found Poe's human heart-eating pet raccoon Carl far more amusing than I probably should have.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/theraven/",The Raven

John Cusack (Poe) plays the part well in my opinion and the movie rolls along quite nicely. It's not the greatest film you will see but it was definitely an entertaining movie. The story was well done too because of the way it involves Edgar Allan Poe in a murder/mystery with some horror movie undertones. Yes the first death scene has a 'SAW' movie feel about it but as a result you are intrigued from the start to see how it all pans out.

91,ksj870,Not At All What It Should Have Been,4,17 May 2012,"If only Vincent Price were still alive. Perhaps the legendary Price, himself a fan of Edgar Allan Poe, and who starred in many adaptations of Poe's stories, could have brought the necessary combination of grand passion, inner turmoil, and sly wit to The Raven that it needed to succeed. But Price is of course long gone, and so we must make do with John Cusack. And it just doesn't work.The Raven is based upon a great premise: in 19th-century Baltimore, a sadistic killer is on the loose, his murders based on the stories of the infamous poet and purveyor of the macabre, Edgar Allan Poe. Poe, penniless and drunk most of the time, is at first a suspect in the murders, but Detective Fields (Luke Evans) realizes that however otherwise dissolute Poe may be, he is not a murderer, and so enlists the writer's aid in cracking the case. The stakes are raised, however, when Poe's own fiancé, Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped. Can Fields and Poe solve the mystery of the murderer's identity in time to save Emily's life, or will Poe be undone by the very fruits of his own grisly imagination? Again, it's a great premise. Poe is one of the greatest horror writers of all time, and a thriller based upon his lurid tales of madness and death has a lot of potential. Sadly, The Raven—which takes its title from perhaps Poe's most famous poem—never realizes its lofty ambitions. The aforementioned John Cusack is the first problem the film is saddled with, for while Cusack is a capable actor the complexities of playing the troubled, rather enigmatic Edgar Allan Poe prove totally beyond him. Cusack never makes his version of Poe likable, or even interesting, and in many ways Evans's much more ably realized Detective Fields is the real star of the show. Alice Eve's lovely and charming performance as Emily goes for naught, as her character doesn't have enough to do and is so underwritten that she lacks any real personality.The Raven does look good, and there are many appealing shots of fog-shrouded streets and dark forests. But the atmosphere is wasted, and the elements of Poe's stories which make it into the script are misused. Familiar Poe stories like The Pit and the Pendulum and The Murders in the Rue Morgue are used for a few gory set pieces that are merely insults to the original tales which inspire them. Suspense is diluted by the inability of the director, John McTeigue, to decide what kind of movie he really wants to make: a mystery? A thriller? A horror-comedy? The Raven isn't solidly any of these things, and so it becomes terribly boring by default.If you really want a good movie inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe, there are a few of them out there, including at least two likewise called The Raven: one starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff , and the other featuring Vincent Price and, again, Boris Karloff. Though both films have entirely different stories to tell, they are also both superior to the new movie in every way. Poe himself was a merciless critic. Were he alive today, I think his own review of The Raven would make mine look glowing by comparison.",The Raven
92,Treyroo,Poe on Patrol,7,24 November 2012,"There are many who seek to entertain by illustrating the darker elements of human existence. Murder, intrigue, the macabre. One of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, author to do so was Edgar Allen Poe. Most have been lucky enough to have never experienced the horror they put on the page brought to life. In this latest John Cusack film, Poe is not so lucky.We first see Poe (played by Cusack) in the last days of his life. The event depicted has been the subject of debate among historians but, for dramatic purposes, it's accepted as fact and I take no issue with that. Days earlier, a woman and child are found and have been murdered in a grisly manner. The murderer managed to flee the scene despite the doors being locked when the police arrived and windows that appeared to be nailed shut. An investigator, Detective Emmett Fields (played by Luke Evans) discovers how the killer concealed his escape and recognizes that the inspiration for the trickery was a work of fiction produced by Poe. He is the prime suspect until another murder is committed while he is being questioned. It appears to be inspired by yet another work of Poe's and so Fields (Evans) hopes that involving the man who used to be his prime suspect might allow him to gain some advantage over the murderer who's now claimed the lives of three innocent people. All the while Poe is madly in love with the daughter of a respected military officer who cannot stand him. But when Emily (Poe's love interest, played by Alice Eve) is in jeopardy, the Captain (Emily's father, played by Brendan Gleeson) and Poe put their differences aside and work together to save the one person they both love more than anything.Now, I believed this was Cusack's first film since 2009's 2012. In fact, I'd forgotten about Hot Tub Time Machine which followed that as did two other films I never even knew about. Also noteworthy is the fact that, of numerous works based on or otherwise connected to Poe and his publications, this is the third to be given the title The Raven. But even with all that against it, this film is entertaining. No member of the cast should hold their breath waiting for an Oscar nomination. Neither should anyone who was involved behind the scenes, but it's an involving tale in an interesting setting with a well-acted cast and I liked it.",The Raven

As others have alluded to the director captures the whole Sleepy Hollow atmosphere 100%. The only redeeming feature was the Cusak portrayal of Poe. Down on his luck , his glory days behind him Poe is seen as a belligerent and egotistical drunk.The amalgamation of truth and fiction simply does not work. Everything is thrown into the mixer from Hammer horror , to Sherlock Holmes to even Saw. Afet the 40 minute mark my mind began to wonder. Even with its serial killer (emblazoned on a newspaper headline - pointed in one scene towards the camera, in case you were not following) copycatting Poes more famous death scenes plot, the affair is strangely tension free. The identity of the killer results in a shrug of the shoulders - oh its him . Who would have guessed? I was never engaged enough to even try to guess the killers identity.

Every time I pressed play again the movie had the same boring aura that even the darkest scenes could not create some kind of a mystical or dark feeling to it.It was not a bad film but it could have given more. The ending could be followed by the killer surviving that shot and ending up in Paris or London to continue his killings, most viewers would agree with me on this.The super computer contemporary style graphics on the ending titles are truly horrible,the guy who did those should get fired or something. It looks like an Iron Man 3 meets TRON movie ending or whatever, I thought I was watching another movie end titles....As for Cusack his role should have been more melodramatic and dark, instead we get a youngish drunk fella that everybody wants to beat up because of his financial debts and silly behavior. I'm not a Poe expert but this looks like crap. Maybe there should be more scenes with Cusack drinking his liver out and do drugs like the From Hell movie. Cusack gives the character a very light approach that should not be there at all.Also more scenes with ravens should have been added and much more blood.Not the greatest movie I've seen but it stands out amongst the tons of crap produced during 2012 and 2011 and it is nice to watch this in a theater rather than your TV set.Soundtrack is almost zero, could have been much better.I give it a 4 skulls out of 10 on the Mike Enslin scale....",The Raven

Baltimore, being such an old city, certainly has that certain creepy charm needed for a good horror story...which is always probably why Poe was drawn there. Anyway, aside from this, the movie fell short. The plot almost works but in most ""mastermind murderer"" films, the whole plot falls apart if the authorities aren't quick enough or are too quick. The long series of clues left by the killer all could have unfolded the entire movie. I know, we're supposed to suspend disbelief, but the more complex the conspiracy, the more likely it won't work.Spoilers:I thought the ending was also poorly done, and if they had worked it better, it might have made the whole movie better. I think rather than have Reynolds escape to France, Poe should have done him in after he consumed the poison. Anyway, The Raven probably could have/should have been a better movie. Poe certainly deserves a better treatment, being one of the original masters of the horror genre. I didn't find Cusack lacking in his portrayal of Poe. The dialogue was decent, and the action kept the pace well enough, though sometimes, it seemed there was action just for the sake of having some action. I'd watch The Raven if you like Poe or the time period, or Gothic horror...but I wouldn't say this will be one of your favorites.",The Raven
96,caiged,Good story with enough intrigue to keep you entertained,7,8 May 2012,"I had been afraid that this would turn out to be like the Sherlock Holmes movies, which I did not like at all, and the trailers certainly seemed to favour that. Thankfully, the actual movie is far from the showboating spectacle that Guy Ritchie has directed.The story follows a killer who's got something for, or against, Edgar Allen Poe, bringing to life some gruesome deaths that Poe has written about in his stories. The turning point comes when Poe's girlfriend is kidnapped and becomes the bait to lure Poe deeper into the killer's madness.The movie does a good job in hooking you from the first scene and does not shy away from blood and gore. One scene in particular is reminiscent of the Saw movies, so I did feel a little squeamish. Thankfully, there was more emphasis on the story than on gory effects so it wasn't too bad. It gets more interesting as the movie draws on. Who's the killer? How does Poe fit into the puzzle? Some questions are answered early but it does keep you guessing as to the identity of the killer till the end, which makes it necessary not to leave your seat to go to the washroom or get another bag of popcorn! The downsides, and there are a few, are mainly in the acting area. John Cusack is well cast physically as he is well made up to look pretty much like Edgar Allan Poe himself. His performance though was a bit on the hammy side, as Cusack tended to rage in a guttural tone at the top of his voice several times which tended to be rather irritating. Alice Eve's performance can best be described as muted. Her voice was timid, her actions limited, her emotions checked. It was as if she was forcibly restrained from emoting anything lively, and that was sad as she's anything but timid and restrained...not with that smile of hers! I also felt that the unmasking of the killer and the rationalization for all the deaths was rather weak. It made the intrigue fade slightly and that is a sore negative point.But Poe fans, those who know about the man, and his stories, should be happy with the story. There are lots of references to his stories and characters and that should keep them happily in their seats till the end. I've never read any Edgar Allan Poe stories so as an objective viewer I can say that I enjoyed watching The Raven and recommend this to anyone interested in a murder mystery!",The Raven
97,slayerjmk95,James McTeigue's The Raven,9,27 April 2012,"The Raven is James McTeigue's new film starring John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe, the famous writer who seems to be experiencing a writer's block, as he has money problems and drinking habits. When a detective (Luke Evans) comes to Poe asking for his help in solving a series of murders involving Poe's stories, Poe begins to suspect that there's a bigger scheme behind the mask of the killer.Masterfully directed by McTeigue, who previously did V for Vendetta (and the fluke, Ninja Assassin), The Raven is a stunning and entertaining set-piece of a period film, mixed with incredible visuals and intense sequences of suspense as Poe begins to get more involved. The way McTeigue captured some of the scenes was just spectacular, especially the part at the church. John Cusack was great as Poe; at first i was a little skeptical, but when i went to the midnight premiere and sat through the first 30 minutes, i knew that the producers made a right choice. Alice Eve was good as Poe's lover, Emily, but nothing too special; mainly eye-candy if you ask me. Luke Evans was just phenomenal as the Inspector, Emmett Fields; he truly is one of the breakout actors of the decade. The music was very moody, truly capturing the terror of the moment when a body is found or Edgar is on the chase. The script wasn't gold, but it was definitely good material for a film like this; it's not something you see every day, and the way they portrayed the time period was just astonishing.All in all, this is an amazing thriller that surpasses the mistake that was Ninja Assassin but ranks just below the instant classic of V for Vendetta. James McTeigue really needs to stick to films like this.9/10 Stars***",The Raven
98,theycallmemrglass,Suitably entertaining 19th century serial killer flick.,7,20 March 2012,"I quite enjoyed this. Storywise, its a bit like Seven set in 19th century London, that is, a serial killer detective mystery but here, the killer is forcing a storyline pattern fusing Edgar Allen Poe's stories to life by imitating the murders from several of his stories creating a new one that involves Edgar Allen Poe himself. Cusack was engaging as the drunken author/poet riding on financial hardship suddenly finding himself helping a detective to catch the killer. At first Poe is quite unlikeable but I then warmed to his idiosyncrasies and determination to find his loved one, whom the serial killer has kidnapped.There's a couple of really graphic and inventive murders suitably qualified for a SAW or Final Destination movie. There is not enough of them to satisfy the horror enthusiast, though. It might have been a good opportunity to make this a fun horror movie to boot given that there are several murders in the film but we are not shown the rest of them.The dialogue alternates between flat and humorous with some fun (but admittedly way over my head) wordplay with Poe's character. Poe enthusiasts might enjoy connecting the references of the murders to the various stories that he has written. I haven't read any of his stories so I cant make any connections. I do know the overall story/poem of the Raven though and I can say with some confidence, this film isn't that story. Its got ravens in it but I'm not sure that justifies the title, if it does then we might as well call every John Woo film, The White Dove.I did look forward to seeing this film, as I love V for Vendetta, James Mctiegue first directorial feature. This, his 3rd, is not as good or as clever but it has the same visceral directorial flair and vibe to it which I enjoyed. The script is full of plot holes though and I was annoyed with some scenes that blatantly cheated for the sake of narrative progression. There isn't anything original here but its competent enough entertainment for a decent Friday night out at the cinema.",The Raven
99,amethystwings32,Awesome!,9,13 May 2012,"I loved this movie, it was full of mystery! Horror and intrigue I liked how the director meshed Poe's life with his work! Because it really captured his torment and inner demons intricately! In every aspect of this macabre web of twists and turns! Definitely not for someone with a weak stomach, due to the vividly graphic scenes ! Which I thought captured the essence of Poe. Since he was the original master of horror, the acting was superb ! John Cusack was excellent by far one his best performances! I have seen so far , with such passion and intensity! In his portrayal of the disturbed troubled poet ! As a fan of Edgar Allan Poe this movie was very entertaining , and blood chilling at the same time! All of the elements required for a horror film . All I can say if you are faint of heart, or have a weak stomach. This might not be the movie for you ! But if you love classic Gothic tales of terror, then this is the movie to see! I would give this movie an + A . Based on his performance alone ! There were only 3 aspects that were a little on the side of the grotesque. That might make some squeamish. All and all excellent !",The Raven
100,NutzieFagin,Edgar Allen Poe vrs The Serial Killer,8,29 April 2012,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be a waste of time seeing it. But I have to actually say that I enjoyed it. I would advise that if you are an Edgar Allen Poe fan or a who done it mystery buff, you will enjoy it too.The film starts out with the city of Baltimore Md suffering horrific serial killings. The killer murders his victims in gory style fashioned after Edgar Allen Poe stories---and even if you haven't read a Poe tale, you should know what they mean---slicing and dicing, walling up alive and torture. Kinda whets the appetites of gore horror buffs. Baffled police eventually contact Poe to help solve the murders and to do some profiling. From then on, its a game of cat and mouse until the conclusion is revealed. Who is it? I never tell....Some people have likened it to the movie Saw because it is a ""Jigsaw killer"" like plot. Like the movie Saw, helpless victims are tortured one by one by a killer who enjoys seeing their victims suffer. But the supreme enjoyment is to choose one victim and see if they can be saved with a race against time. Some of the facts about Edgar Allen Poe are true--he suffered from alcoholism and seemed to die from it, but the plot of the movie is fiction.I am from Maryland myself and a devout Poe fan. So bone up one your Poe stories before seeing the movie. And may you NEVER MORE see any movies that you not enjoy. This stylish mystery yarn should have you riveted.",The Raven
101,rcastl2335,"A hash, possibly a stew",1,28 April 2012,"A wonderful, macabre film, a la Shakespeare In Love, could be made from Edgar Allan Poe's work and life. The Raven, which uses his work in a serial killer investigation film, ain't it. The basic idea is modestly clever: a serial killer in 1849 Baltimore is murdering people using scenarios from Poe's stories. A police detective recognizes the pattern and pulls in the writer to help in the investigation. Not a bad idea had it been developed in an intelligent or witty way, like Time After Time or Shakespeare In Love. Instead it becomes a random hash of ""clues"" that have no consistent sense. Cusack, though he looks much healthier and in better shape than he has in years, is miscast as Poe. Although Poe as written: a horse-galloping, Colt .45 wielding hero, would be hard to play for anyone. (At the stage of his life depicted in the film Poe was in fact a deathly ill alcoholic in his last days.)Luke Evans, who plays the police detective Fields, is a ruggedly attractive void on the screen; Alice Eve as Poe's lover is bountifully beautiful and also a void; Brendan Gleeson plays her disapproving father as...very disapproving. Stick around for the end credits, though. They seem to arrive from a different film altogether and I swear that's Willie Nelson singing over a Nine Inch Nails musical backing. Very odd but it will help lift you out of your chair and the theater itself.",The Raven
102,blogurious,Gruesome Poe,6,22 June 2012,"There seems to be a few movies with the same name and inspired by Edgar Alan Poe's literary work. And as dark as some of his stories may be, those movies carry the gruesome idea of murder and the killer's obsession with the writer. ""The Raven"" happens to be a new version of how Poe's work could influence people who were leaning over the border between sanity and the will to justify their existence by committing horrendous crimes that no one would be able to forget. The movie has a gripping opening scene based on one of Poe's stories that sets the tone for the next hour and a half to finally end with a combination of fiction with reality to find a smart verdict for Poe's mysterious death, which is not too shabby. The studios are usually putting their creative mind to the test and using their talent to delve into a famous person's life without pushing to hard is quite a task that, in this case, had a happy ending. Interesting, although suffering a bit from a lagging effect.",The Raven

Or so he thinks.....But when he barges in a bar there asking for a free drink because he's the literary king no one recognises him there . Instead he gets a punch and a kick out of the bar . But maybe thats because its just a bar filled with drunken louts.....So how does the literary king eke out a living ?? He does that by writing grisly stories of even more grislier murders full of sharp weapons and bloody deaths .......And to eke out a living he has to keep on churning out the stories week after week to be published in the newspapers which the greedy public reads to satisfy their bloodsoaked fantasies .But his literary talents earn him one other thing---love of a beautiful woman......a woman who dares to go against her father who threatens to shoot Edgar dead if he continues the romance . That further enthuses the blonde blueeyed beautiful woman who proposes marriage---a marriage she feels will be in the perfect setting for Edgar ; after all nothing could be more perfect than the marriage of the writer of grisly murder stories occurring under the threat of death at the hands of her father......But unfortunately there are other less delicate admirers of Edgar Allan Poe's work ; and one of them is a demented psychopath who decides to murder people in the exact way as written in Edgar's books---by cutting into two the bodies of his victims with the help of a saw for example...... ......And Edgar's work continues to give this psycho inspiration for different kinds of more grisly murders......all of which attracts the attention of the police who decide to enlist Edgar's help in solving the murders as they are based on his writings anyway......But the demented psycho has a newer and bolder plan---to make the threat of death on Edgar's wedding even more real by kidnapping his wife and making him churn out grislier stories on pain of his wife's death by keeping her locked up......So does the psycho's plan succeed ?? Or does Edgar succeed in finding out who he is ?? And to what lengths and sacrifices Edgar is willing to go to save his wife ?? Will he trade his own life for hers ?? Go and watch the movie for that......I found it a decent watch......,The Raven
104,Nullness,"Quoth the Raven, ""This movie sucks.""",2,30 May 2012,"A charmless, sluggish, joyless spectacle lacking thrills or horror, the Raven offers nothing and has absolutely nothing to say. Cusack gives little effort in raising his Poe beyond a slightly witty curmudgeon, but fails even this, as his wit is witless and his charm suffocating in wood. The ""Poe-themed"" crimes are an artless display lacking neither the campy fun of a Hammer death nor the sleaze of Saw-inspired torture: like the movie itself, they serve no purpose but to further PLOT, and when PLOT is as half-hearted as it is in the Raven, it is not long before the audience is snoring in sleep.After a perfectly fine Masquerade Ball sequence, the film's thrilless plot begins rolling, and it is as fresh and enticing as moldy toast. Tired sequence after tiring sequence follows, full of mediocre mystery, devoid of either realism or originality. The (obvious) villain, once he is (obviously) revealed, gives the dull, canned reasons for the murders any viewer of average-intelligence expected all along. No interesting conflict is addressed, no true or heroic or even interesting mountain must Poe climb- the audience is left feeling as hollow as the film's heart, and even the James Bond-influenced closing credits can't save them from feeling like they have experienced a goofy pockmark of clichés. Goofy, yet not goofy enough to be enjoyable. But sadly perhaps just goofy enough to annoy, and turn some off Poe forever.",The Raven
105,stephenrtod,Compromise,8,18 February 2013,"I taught Poe's poetry and short stories for over 40 years, and I think that ""The Raven"" strikes a useful compromise between Poe purists who expect the feature-length film to satisfy devotees of Poe - and those who either have never read Poe or have scarce knowledge of his works, his style or his life.John Cusack continues to select very challenging roles and to command my attention with his voice, his body, his use of stillness, space and time. I have seen John Astin's one man Edgar Allan Poe live performance, and I am amazed at Cusack's ability to create a sympathetic character considering Poe's struggles at West Point, with his stepfather, with substance abuse, poverty, and great discouragement considering his immense talent. I'd be curious to see the reaction, in general, of European audiences to this movie, spectators who, for the most part appreciate Poe far more than most Americans.Alice Eve could just smile or read the phone book, and she'd make an impression; but she plays a courageous young woman; and in so doing, Eve must, herself, have been a more courageous person than I in enacting one of the most harrowing scenes in a Poe story; I could not have done it for love or money. She did it so well, it not only seemed to be really happening, I had to make myself breathe deeply, slowly and deliberately so that I would not panic; and I was just watching a movie.Wickedness is delightfully horrible as depicted in this film, a grim reminder that great intelligence is not always utilized for benign purposes; and that flesh-and-blood chess games can be as deadly as a razor-sharp pendulum.I have been a movie fan all of my life, and I must say I thought this film was a far better artistic accomplishment than any of the professional reviews I have scanned were willling to admit. I suppose that many critics feel they are paid to find fault with all but one or two movies every year because their critical acumen is always being weighed against the most successful reviewers.There is violence, blood and gore and considerable disturbing mayhem in this film; but it's not overdone; it doesn't glorify any of the gruesome details, but audiences need to know that this is going to be a fictional (as far as plot) story involving Edgar Allan Poe, but also one which will weave actual details from many of his most famous works into the fabric of this movie. The gruesome is presented honestly. Several readings of Poe's poetry are done in exemplary fashion. The European set is fitting in an exciting and dangerous-looking way, dark, dank, and tensely-expectant. Seemingly, candle light rules the interior shots. Surprises are not telegraphed, which makes their impact sudden and jolting.I especially enjoyed watching the film a second time listening to the commentary by those who produced the film. I learned then, how a multitude of artistic and cinematic choices were actually made.I would recommend the movie strongly for those who are familiar with Edgar Allan Poe and who have read and like his literary works. It is primarily a dramatic work, however, not a scholarly treatise, and I noticed three or four inaccuracies pertinent to Poe's life and works. The movie is good enough to inspire me to go back and read ""The Telltale Heart,"" ""The Cask of the Amontillado,"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" as well as ""The Premature Burial.""",The Raven
106,mangoamante,"Gothic, artistic mystery",8,15 November 2020,"This was a dark, creepy, mysterious, and gothic period piece. It had that great gothic moodiness and emotion. I quite enjoyed it.

107,knowyourmovie,This second-rate thriller might be recommended for John Cusack fans only...,6,4 November 2012,"If I were asked to come up with a single word describing ""The Raven"", it would have been ""underwhelming"". This anemic second-rate movie is by no means what we expected from the Australian director James McTeigue whose 2005 debut – the stylish Sci-Fi action thriller ""V for Vendetta"" - was refreshingly interesting, emotionally touching and received well- deserved favorable reviews from critics and wide audience alike.Sadly, unlike ""V for Vendetta"" ""The Raven"" is virtually indistinguishable from the multitude of the mediocre thrillers continuously produced by Hollywood. There is nothing in particular about this movie (except maybe the acting to some extent) that would set it apart from the rest of the pack. The weakest component of this so-so thriller is its pitiful screenplay carelessly tossed together by the inexperienced newcomers Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare. The mystery thriller audience, being not too picky, perhaps could have forgiven most of the flaws plaguing ""The Raven"" - from the glaring plot holes, to the puzzling loose ends, to the failed character development attempts. Unfortunately for the movie, it contains a major defect that cannot be that easily overlooked: the alarming lack of logic combined with the shocking absence of psychological credibility. Things simply do not add up in ""The Raven"" both from logical and from psychological perspectives.Not only the final scenes of ""The Raven"" where the dangerous secrets are revealed and the deep mysteries are resolved are regrettably anticlimactic, but they also leave us in a state of perplexed disappointment. Now, that we finally know ""the truth"", the more we think about it, the less credible it looks to us. The harder we try putting all the pieces of the puzzle together, the clearer we see that it does not have plausible solution. Moreover, we keep finding more and more fundamental flaws: logical inconsistencies, practical infeasibilities, and psychological impossibilities.In addition to having major issues with the ""mystery"" part, ""The Raven"" also somewhat disappoints as a thriller. Simply put, the movie is not thrilling enough. It almost never reaches the level of suspense necessary to keep us ""glued"" to the screen. While ""The Raven"" prominently features reckless chases, spooky dark tunnels, mysterious strangers, secluded hiding places, and dangerous misty forests, all these genre clichés apparently do not work as designed and leave us mostly disengaged as a result. Some key ingredients necessary for boosting excitement and stirring up emotions appear to be hopelessly missing from these formulaic, unoriginal scenes.The similar observation is applicable to the gruesome murders that the mysterious villain of the piece appears to be painstakingly copying from the Poe's stories. With all their shocking images and gory details, these crime scenes are not in the least impressive and are far more disgusting than terrifying. In fact, somehow the authors managed to make them almost boring, lacking clever and tasteful visual presentation as well as intriguing intellectual substance.Another disappointing observation is related to the language used in the movie. I am not necessarily against certain language modernizations in the historical pieces, but these language adjustments should be unobtrusive enough to be appreciated by the audience. Avoiding language archaisms should be done in a tasteful manner; it benefits greatly from a careful, measured approach.Unfortunately, ""The Raven"" does not demonstrate necessary caution in handling the delicate language adjustments. As a result, instead of flowing smoothly and blending nicely, the overly modernized language of the movie unexpectedly becomes a focus of the unwanted attention.Of the very few decent scenes in the movie, most are funny ones, filled with warm irony and soft humor. One scene of that kind that comes to mind is the hilarious little show where Poe reads one of his famous melodramatic tear-jerking poems to the adoring female audience. Not surprisingly, the scenes where the timeless Poe's poetry and prose are recited from the screen are among the rare true highlights of the movie.As I hinted before, the only reason why you might consider watching this otherwise quite ordinary thriller is the good acting. John Cusack gives a nuanced, atmospheric performance as the famous American author Edgar Allan Poe, even despite this well-known historical character being mercilessly deformed for ""The Raven"" by the shrewd gang of ignorant screenwriters.Brendan Gleeson is solid and memorable as usual as Captain Hamilton, a disapproving father of Poe's love interest – Emily Hamilton, unconvincingly and colorlessly played by Alice Eve (She's Out of My League, 2010). In the movie, Emily is for various reasons out of Edgar's league, whereas on the acting field the disposition is the opposite: John Cusack is hopelessly out of Alice Eve s league. In addition, very little chemistry can be detected between the lovebirds, Edgar and Emily, which makes their love theme look strained and unconvincing.Luke Evans, previously known mostly for his thoroughly mediocre so- called ""Zeus"" from the weak ""Immortals"" fares a little better and looks slightly more mature in ""The Raven"" but still does not impress. I am not sure whether it is a lack of experience, a limited range of acting abilities, or a poor work of the director, or a combination of the three, but Luke Evans visibly lacked sophistication and versatility while playing Detective Fields – the second most important character in the movie. His acting looked one-dimensional compared to the captivating, multi-faceted performances of John Cusack Brendan Gleeson and Kevin McNally (Maddux, the newspaper editor).In conclusion, you might be much better off reading the classic poems and stories by Edgar Allan Poe than watching the unremarkable ""The Raven"" noteworthy only for its shameless exploit of the Poe's everlasting legacy.The movie can be recommended for hardcore John Cusack fans only, since, unfortunately for Brendan Gleeson fans, there is not enough Brendan Gleeson in ""The Raven"" to justify watching the whole movie for the sake of his performance.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",The Raven

109,StorieLuver,The creator of the detective story IN a detective story!,8,29 February 2020,"During the scene where Poe is writing the first of his stories for the kidnapper, he says to Detective Fields ""I feel as if I've gone from author to character in one of my many tales,"" and in a way, he HAS. Most literary historians agree that Poe was the creator of the modern detective story when he wrote ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (the story acted out in this film's opening scene). Poe's hero C. August Dupin was THE original detective, and it was hard to tell whether it was Fields or Poe playing the Dupin role in this film. I find it interesting that many other reviewers drew a comparison between this film and ""Sherlock Holmes,"" because even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said ""Where was the detective story until Poe breathed life into it?"" Thus, it was a treat to watch the creator of the detective story BECOME a detective in this film, as well as watch his other creations be acted out.However, I had to subtract two stars for a few reasons:
1) The fictional character of Emily Hopkins. In real life, there were ACTUAL women whom Poe pursued after his wife Virginia's death. This movie could've featured Sarah Elmira (nee Royster) Shelton, his love interest from before he went to college and the woman whom he actually WAS engaged to at the time of his death, as the heroine. Or Frances Sargent Osgood, to whom he wrote the riddle poem ""A Valentine,"" with her name hidden within, and whose youngest daughter may or may not have been Poe's illegitimate love-child. Why make up a fictional character when there were real, and MUCH more interesting options with better TRUE backstories, to use?
2) The goatee. When I first heard that John Cusack was taking the role of Poe, I thought he was an excellent choice due to having a similar forehead and eyes. However, this movie had to go and wreck the look by adding a goatee. The real Poe was famous for his MOUSTACHE!!!
3) The (mis)use of ""Annabel Lee"" and Virginia Poe. In this film, one of Poe's most famous poems, ""Annabel Lee"" is misconstrued as a love poem being used to woo his new girlfriend. In reality, most literary historians agree that the poem was actually an elegy to his dead wife Virginia. In addition, this film woefully overlooks the role of Virginia in Poe's life, devoting exactly one mention of her from Poe. In reality, most biographers agree that it was the loss of Virginia that caused Poe's downward spiral during the last two years of his life.",The Raven
110,peteranderson975,Mystery thriller romp with a pulpy comic book feel.,7,9 March 2012,"This film is story set during the last few days in the life of Edgar Allen Poe. Poe (John Cusack) is a penniless drunk (with a pet raccoon for some reason), depending on money he gets from The Baltimore Times for writing acerbic reviews of other writers' work to keep him in the booze. Emily (Alice Eve) the woman he loves is difficult to reach because her father Colonel Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) has a very understandable dislike of Poe so they have sneak around behind his back.The police are investigating two brutal murders of a mother and her 12- year-old daughter in a locked room. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) notices the parallels between these murders and the Poe story Murders in the Rue Morgue so he sends a squad of policemen out to bring Poe in for questioning. Although Fields doesn't believe Poe is responsible for the murders he is definitely connected to them.There's a second murder this time based on the story The Pit and The Pendulum and this is a pretty gory killing as you can imagine if you are aware of the story (if you are not I'll just say the pendulum has an enormous blade on the end of it). The victim this time is a writer at The Baltimore Times who wrote highly negative reviews of Poe's stories. A crimson mask found on body is a message from the killer to Poe and the police about where he will strike next. The killer is playing a game with them and when the life of his beloved Emily is threatened Poe is forced to play the killer's game.This was an entertaining mystery thriller and I did like the inclusion of Poe's stories in this film. The setting felt authentic enough and there was no anachronistic steam punk stuff going on like so many other alternative history stories. The cast are reasonable enough, especially Brendan Gleeson, but they don't really get too much development. I don't have any doubt that Cusack's performance bore very little resemblance to the real Edgar Allen Poe but it was fun and over the top and similar to Robert Downey Juniors's take on Sherlock Holmes. Anyone expecting dark melancholia and madness will probably not like this film but for people only passingly familiar with Poe it is a mystery thriller romp with a pulpy comic book feel.Rating 7/10",The Raven

Handily, Poe himself is also in the same city.John Cusack does his best as the investigating Edgar but is no match for Vincent Price, a previous occupant of this role. The direction is flat and while the film looks superficially handsome, it doesn't compare to the Roger Corman/Richard Matheson collaborations on Poe's The Fall Of The House of Usher and Pit And The Pendulum.

112,FFman-847-460126,Poe would be Ashamed,2,30 April 2012,"Poe would castrate all the men involved in the making of this movie. I  may not know much about Edger Allen Poe, but I know that much. The  start of the movie's problem is that John Cusack was casted to play a  man who is eloquent and drunk throughout. Cusack cannot pull off  either. Every time he manages to piece together another ""eloquent""  sentence, it's difficult not to laugh at the face Cusack makes. It's  almost like he is confused at the meaning while simultaneously pleased  that he was successful in delivering the line. It kind of reminds me of  George W. Bush.  The Raven is written by two people who have never written a big-screen  flick and directed by someone who has never directed by himself before.  The only way this movie ever got funded is because some studio realized  that plenty of people would go see a movie about Poe. Unfortunately,  the script was so horrible that only the actors who care about money  would take it. I assume Cusack got the part because Nicolas Cage was  busy.  The Raven is built on one of the worst scripts I have ever heard. The  story tries to build up a suspenseful mystery. It doesn't work. You  will spend most your time trying to figure out all the plot holes.  Eventually you will give up and try to enjoy the acting instead. That  won't work. If it's not the bad acting, it is the words they are  saying. I cringed no fewer than ten times at the absurd dialogue that  the screenwriters try to shove down their actor's throats.  Luke Evans plays Detective Fields in The Raven. At first, I was  confused by his role. Was he simply drunk or depressed in his first  scene. As the movie carries on, you will find that there is nothing  wrong with his character. The problem is in his acting. He is supposed  to be dark in a mysterious way. Instead, he comes across as a pouting  15-year-old girl who goes on a city-wide search for her lost lipstick.  Luke Evans deserves a Razzie for this atrocious acting job. Please stop  giving him roles.  There is no reason to see this movie. If you like Edger Allen Poe, stay  far away from this movie. It destroys everything that is Poe by trying  to explain the mystery that surrounds his final days. If you don't like  Poe and simply want to see a good mystery, go see The Woman in Black  instead. This movie is a likely contender for ""The Worst Movies of  2012.""",The Raven
113,kdorsey321,Detective Poetry,8,29 April 2012,"This review is on the movie ""The Raven,"" starring John Cusack, Luke Evans, and Alice Eve. When I saw the previews for this film I was automatically hook. I haven't read any of Edgar Allan Poe's novels, but I have heard a lot of great things about them. The previews made the movie look real catchy with a writer (Edgar Allan Poe) going after a murderer that is mimicking his novels. Looked like a descent film and I was excited to see it.This film is about a writer (Edgar Allan Poe) who has an admirer. The problem with this admirer is that this admirer is willing to bring the deaths in Edgar Allan Poe's novels to life. In the mist of this the murder starts to play a game and challenges Edgar Allan Poe in a battle of wits. To make sure he plays the game, the murderer takes something very valuable to Poe.I thought this was a very good film. ""The Raven"" picks up the mystery/thriller ball and doesn't get any scratches on it. I love the way John Cusack character was. I love his passion for his writing and how he felt nothing anyone else was going was better than what he was writing. I also like how just about everything Poe said was dipped in poetic form. The screen writing was simply brilliant in this movie. The ending wasn't typical either. I liked that about this movie. There's nothing like a movie you can't predict. This movie was gruesome though. If your stomach doesn't do well with gruesomeness, you might want to sit this one out. This isn't a difficult movie to follow, but you have to pay attention though. You may have to see the movie two or three times to fully understand how Poe and Fields (detective in movie) figure out the murderers scheme.Overall, I felt like this was a pretty descent film and I'm giving this film an 8.5 out of 10. You have my blessing to see this film in the movie theaters. I will purchase this movie on DVD.",The Raven

And that's only the first 10 minutes. But who knows what they thought they were making before editing and post production.Cusack's bar speech sounds like every liberal do gooder rant he has ever given in an interview, when we're supposed to applaud him for being politically well informed-this time his ire is his barrroom peers lack of a complex literary aesthetic.I used to love john cusack, but now I'm realizing that i liked him for his supporting roles and cameos, other than Grosse Pointe Blank, which was just brilliant.Sleepy hollow and Robert Downey Jr's turn as Sherlock were far better similar genre films, but it seems john wants to join the 1980's alt brat pack midlife career revival by dressing the part and wearing a goatee.No spoilers here, I can't be bothered to continue watching.",The Raven
116,Urantia,The Black Raven of Boredom,1,21 December 2012,"The black raven of boredom devoured my bitter brain with the fickle flicker of each passing frame. He paused every now and then in between a burp and a bite to remind me that this film's folly was to be blinded by the madness of the night where the dull destiny of dreariness consumed every painted pixel of deadly distortion and the illumination of reason was abandoned in a passionless puddle of great proportion. Alas, when the closing credits finally rolled in response to my prayers to the good Lord above who also resides as a gift to the mind deep within, I began to feel my empty skull slowly heal with the rapid exit of this foul-smelling memory of witnessing this sinister cinematic sin. And as I cast my eyes over to the lifeless bones of the black raven who died with his clutching claws desperately targeting the rewind button on the dusty remote, I suddenly discovered a tiny handwritten note which had been tied tightly around his faint and feeble throat. It read as follows: ""To whomever survives this torturous agony of melancholious monotony concealed within less than five evil gigabytes of diabolically conceived insanity, do not forget to warn others of this wicked curse in the hopes they might avoid this treacherous calamity thrust upon the silly stage of Poe-profanity as a small stain trying to soil forever the sweet innocence of divinely evolving humanity.""",The Raven

With that being said, the movie is still really good. It's a compelling mystery with twist and turns you won't see coming. I will say the resolution isn't really what you'd expect, but the rest of the film makes up for that in great acting, atmosphere, and story. If you're already a Poe fan definitely give this a watch, there might be something to be found. 8.5",The Raven
118,jeddjong,Never Say Nevermore,4,26 June 2012,"In National Treasure, America's founding fathers were the guardians of a secret treasure stash. In the Men In Black films, Elvis, Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone (who is coincidentally planning his own Poe biopic) are aliens. The Brothers Grimm fought mythical monsters. Here, Edgar Allan Poe is roped in by Baltimore's finest to solve a series of murders based on his stories. This may not seem as impressive, but taking into account the legendary author's dark imagination and famously macabre stories, the crimes are pretty gruesome. This is the guy credited with the creation of the modern horror and detective stories, after all. There is tremendous potential in the idea of Poe pitted against a killer who takes direct inspiration from his tales. Unfortunately, most of it is squandered in favour of unsophisticated slasher movie fare. ""People love blood and murder"", Reynolds (Kevin R McNally) the newspaper editor tells Poe. And in that respect, the movie delivers – the most gruesome murder happens relatively early on in the movie, where the victim is cut in half by a lowering bladed pendulum, something out of a Saw film – though Poe did it first in The Pit and the Pendulum. Problem is, more people are likely to have a Saw film than read Poe's story. John Cusack's Poe is quite a disappointment. He's portrayed as the typical eccentric artist, and there's no mystique or danger, especially given the enigma the real Poe was. Cusack also doesn't fit into the period surroundings at all; one would half expect him to lift a ghetto blaster over his head. At its worst, it brings to mind Nicolas Cage – not a good thing. Inspector Fields, as played by Luke Evans, is earnest, hardworking, dedicated – and absolutely one-note and boring. The interesting dynamic that might have existed between the author and the policeman is all but absent. The inclusion of Alice Eve as Emily Hamilton, a love interest for Poe, is done rather lazily, considering that he had a wife but was famously asexual and apparently only loved her platonically. But that would have been too difficult to portray and would have gotten in the way of the pulpy thrills now, wouldn't it? And so, she's quickly put in jeopardy as a motivator for Poe, and to force Poe and her disapproving father (Brendan Gleeson) to work together. When the identity of the killer is revealed, it is more likely to induce an indifferent ""meh"" as opposed to the desired ""gasp!"" And that's the cardinal sin when it comes to whodunits. Director James McTeigue also delights in heavy-handed faux-symbolism – just because the title of the movie is ""The Raven"" doesn't mean one or more of the birds have to flutter into frame in every other scene. However, the art direction and the re-creation of 19th Century Baltimore are generally pretty good. So, this is pretty much average Poe.",The Raven
119,stephen7272,80 years after it's time,4,10 May 2015,There has been a recent trend towards American Gothic horror. The Raven fitted this genre. It was a commercial failure but still has it's admirers. So let me examine why it was a financial flop.There is plenty of gory action so the reason does not lie there. Both Poe and the murderer indulge in their passion. There is a close partnership between Poe and the police detective. 19th American society is vividly portrayed. The search for Emily and the kidnapper is intriguing and unpredictable. So that's 5 out of 5 good things about this movie.But the movie is not contemporary. It requires an understanding of Poe's fiction and his literary quotes which is lost on much of today's non-literary audience. It is even harder to comprehend for foreign audiences.This movie could have been as commercially successful as other American horror if it had been filmed in the 1930's. 2012 is just too late for it to capture the attention of a worldwide audience.,The Raven
120,poyrazbaklan,Why Poe? Why him?,4,3 December 2012,"The Raven is a sub-par thriller movie, setting John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe which most of you know as the writer of some awesome horror stories like the Black cat and the Masque of the Red Death, and the famous poem, the Raven. Only the movie is not about him, or any of his works at all. Cusack is so so in his role, he doesn't actually look like how Poe is depicted and his character isn't well developed throughout the movie at all. We only know that he is Poe and he wrote the raven and a bunch of stories and that is it. The real deal is the killer who is murdering people on occasions inspired by Poe's stories. Why? Not explained. Even the killings aren't very well done, since Poe's stories never really focus on the kills but more on the human mind committing them. None of this here. The setting is actually good, with top hats and misty streets obscuring your vision and a Jack the ripper-esque killer on the loose gives you chills but there is no story underneath it all. Poe has to explain each time which story it was because the murders are tangential and not really the same as what his stories tell. And the fact that the real E.A. Poe is found dead on a street is woven into the story when the killer poisons him! See it all comes together! Right?? No!! They should have just made a generic movie and leave Poe out of this, like ""In Hell"" but noo it had to based on someone.",The Raven
121,vlevensonnd-1,Unfortunately Over Acted & Boring,6,28 April 2012,"I have a great appreciation of Poe, and I have a great appreciation of Cusack. What the he__ went wrong with this movie? From the very first statement that showed on the screen that he was found dead on park bench, I thought, ""What???"" Poe was found face down in a gutter in front of Ryan's Saloon and died three days later of what was suspected of alcoholism, with a remote possibility of complications of diabetes, or even rabies, however, shortly before his death, it was reported that he was behaving in a manner consistent with mild epilepsy, or of his bipolar disorder. OK, Oh well, it's Hollywood, right?? From the get-go, the acting was so over the top, and made Cusack appear to be an unseasoned newbie, however, Luke Evans shined in his role. The script appeared to be written rapidly and without care.It said it was a horror movie, however, it is actually a murder mystery, and not a very good one. Agatha Christie would've definitely thrown this one out. If the author makes the suspect way too un-obvious, then what is the fun it in?? This could have been done so far better then what the final product actually was. Unfortunately, it was a large disappointment. Better luck next time.",The Raven
122,buddybhupender,"'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!",8,18 July 2012,"As everyone know Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.[1] He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.But as it has been proved time and time again that if you are alive people might not take much interest in your work or life or ideology but if you die in mysterious circumstances they will try to know every thing about you so that they can determine what actually was behind all this. As is the case of this movie. I really didn't knew anything about Poe but after watching this movie i did read some of his stuff mainly His famous poem ""THE RAVEN"" which made people notice Poe in the first place and eventually the production house decided to borrows its title from the very same poem. Thought this bird had nothing to do with the original movie it somehow brings the required darkness or environmental effect in this movie like The Opera directed by Legendary Dario Argento. What is Good: Well the historical settings, the suspense and gore, pace of the story and nice blend of fiction and history; a really intelligent mixture of real life character with detective fiction.What's Bad: Well Cusack did his best but some how weak screenplay let him down in performing his character to perfection, the not so smart climax and somehow predicable storyline(not overall-some places maybe).Loo Break: Not actually, the fast story and events will not let u leave.Verdict: The Raven is a good watch for most of its duration but a weak screenplay might disappoint the extreme fans of thrill & suspense.Script Analysis: The story of Ben Livingston (screenplay) & Hannah Shakespeare gives you historical account of Poe's life, work & his and love interest and tries to mix it with a crime tale to mold the last days of his life into something totally believable and to some extent audience not aware of the legendary Poet's life will fall for it. The treatment of the script is similar to the 1999 novel Archangel by Thomas Harris where former Russian Dictator Stalin is taken as the backdrop and he shows how old KGB spy forms a plot to bring his legacy back in Kremlin and Moscow. Though both novel and movie differs in many angles but overall a real life character is taken here and something fictional is created. And if we look at the script it has weight but some little more effort was required especially in the climax part. Star Performance: Luke Evans as Detective Fields of Baltimore PD was good in his role and he managed to survive the shortcomings of the script. Alice Eve as Emily Hamilton did OK and there was not much for her to do and i would give her a benefit of doubt due to the limitation of her character but she pleases to eyes. Sam Hazeldine was impressive. And Last but not the least Our John Cusack well also fell prey to the weak characterization;but he was not alone to blame because the director made a lots of physical changes for his on screen appearance and i think if they would have been according to real life photographs of Poe like his mustache and hair style he(Cusack)some how would have appeared more convincing in his role as Poe but he looks more like a wanna be playboy stuck into the thresh hold of his old character and the new one he wants to be; in short, he never fully grasped or penetrated the character. But again you may forgive him once the climax is finished.Direction: James McTeigue who is known for his work as first unit director of major successful Hollywood block busters especially with Wachowski brothers like The matrix series and V for Vendetta and star wars to name a few has once again shown his knack for tales of fiction and mystery. He overall manages to bring this movie somehow a realistic feel despite the weak narration and twists offered by the writers. He has used the atmospheric elements like fog and lightening and half lit corridors and tunnels to give a much darker theme to the movie which is commendable. The Last Word: The Raven Despite its weak screenplay especially towards the climax is overall a good watch and if one forgets the shortcomings of the script it is a good entertainer. The only complain i have is the way the movie finished was really abrupt. My Rating 7.9/10 because despite its weakness it entertained me.",The Raven
123,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of The Raven,6,13 February 2013,"The Raven is a 2012 horror film starring John Cusack as Edgar Allen Poe. So The Raven is about a killer patterning his murders after Poe's books. The Raven suffers from bad acting and overacting, but I think Luke Evans did a fair job. The Raven takes it self a tad to seriously and that is also a main problem. The las complaint is that the reveal is not very satisfying.Some of The Raven's strong points are the kills and the atmosphere it creates.I also wish that they had taken the time to make this more about the chills and less about the gore. Overall this film is good to watch,but you may be a little disappointed. See this flick if you want to see Saw in the 1800s.

So why is he always there waiting for Poe and the police to arrive? what if he gets arrested or shot? it'd be over.I'll tell you why, because we need chase scenes amidst this boring plot. Poe's fiancé get kidnapped by the serial killer via sloppy editing and locked in a coffin somewhere. But the audience doesn't care, to say she has no character is the mega- understatement of all time, she has one look on her face the whole movie, ""smile"", so she's smiling whilst locked in a coffin and whilst in other peril, and her actress if abysmally poor to boot.John Cusack straddles a fine line between Eccentricity and Pure Over- Acting. I honestly don't know if he cared or if he tried too hard, neither would surprise me.This movie is ultimately vapour, in one ear and out the other,there's nothing to hold onto once the film is over, no-one will remember this movie this time next year.

It's too bad, because at it's heart, there is a fun concept here and a good mystery. The story never gets dull, the mystery unravels at a good pace, and there are plenty of twists and turns. But it's Poe himself that is the weakest part of the story. He starts off as whinny and annoying, and then somehow becomes an adventuring flatfoot -- it's all a little hard to swallow. I've always had hangups against turning real people into fictitious characters, but it becomes clear at the end why they decided to do this. And it's kind of a nifty idea. Then again, this story wouldn't have changed, and probably would have been more believable if Poe wasn't the one in the title role, and this took place in another time with another protagonist.

129,jymwrite-1,Tell Tale Movie,8,27 April 2012,"On October 3, 1849 Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering the streets of Baltimore, delirious, calling out the name Reynolds. There have been lots of theories as to what Poe died of, from tuberculosis, rabies or to a drunken bender. ""The Raven"" puts forth a more romantic theory and a detective story for the man who invented the modern detective novel.""The Raven"" as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe's life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe's stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe's girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily's whereabouts with each new murder he commits.The filmmakers, director James McTeigue and writers Ben Livingstone and Hannah Shakespeare don't try to recast Poe's character as a superhero or give the movie Poe attributes that the real Poe didn't or couldn't possess. As mentioned before, the filmmakers stick fairly accurately to the known elements of Poe's last few days, although there are some artistic liberties taken, and they still present an entertaining movie with a few twists and turns as to who the murderer is.Cusack is spot on as Poe from his look, thin with a black mustache and goatee, to (more importantly) Poe's character. Poe was a writer who had the ultimate confidence in his own abilities as a writer and was dismissive of his contemporaries, especially if they were more successful. Cusack is supported by a cast that hits every note right.If you think a movie about Edgar Allan Poe won't have enough action for you, this is a movie for you. If you're more literary minded and think this movie will have too many inaccuracies or violate Poe's character or will throw in too much action, you won't be disappointed.",The Raven

Very happy to say that I was most pleasantly surprised with how nicely made this film was; it was very atmospheric via the combination of great sets, costumes, and excellent camera work. The acting is also top notch. Add in a pretty good script and some good direction and all comes together for one heck of an enjoyable tale. Poe fans may be a bit put off at some of the twists involved, but I thought that they worked quite well and would daresay that Poe himself would likely not be offended one little bit.

131,filmcritic3,Nifty blend of fact and fiction,8,28 April 2012,"THE RAVENOnce upon a midday dreary, as I left the theatre, apprehensive and weary (this was necessary because I was at the Pittsburgh Waterfront; a once blighted area that then Mayor Tom Murphy thought could be rejuvenated if the taxpayers fitted the bill for building new stores and restaurants. Now it's an area with new stores and restaurants that you must exit by 10pm for your own personal safety. Muggings, rapes and shootings are the order of the Waterfront, once darkness rules and the profiled minorities come out to play.) having just seen the tale of THE RAVEN, a thriller, portrayed as of yore. As I nodded, nearly ecstatic with appreciation, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gentling rapping, rapping on a Red One Camera, HD multi-lens, for a look that often parallels Tim Burton's crisp metallic grey aura.Eagerly I sought to borrow, memories of creative camera angles in photoplay storytelling. Vainly, those angles, created by Cinematographer Danny Ruhlmann, sought to borrow from this viewing, surcease of sorrow; sorrow for the mundane, humdrum camera work that so dominates today's fare. It succeeded, as the stately THE RAVEN has a creative and engaging look, majestic as it sits upon the pallid bust of PallasAh, distinctly I remember the rousing score of Lucas Vidal; especially the end credits sequence which rivals anything produced by Danny Elfman. And each dying ember of celluloid, so masterfully spliced by Editor Niven Howie, to create a rare and radiant beauty called THE RAVEN, nameless here, evermore.Enough of this droll hacking of Poe's classic! On with the review!It is 1867, the final days of Edgar Allan Poe, and a deranged serial killer, for motives unknown, is using Poe's tales as inspiration for a series of gruesome killings. Inspector Fields, a watered down American version of Sherlock Holmes, fronts the investigation, but is at wits end until he approaches Poe himself, to serve as consultant in the case. Poe is played well by John Cusack, an Outtakes favorite. Yet even Cusack's normally dominating screen presence is overshadowed by Luke Evans' portrayal of Fields. His characterization often reduces Cusack's Poe to supporting actor. A nifty bit of shooting enables Fields to exit the story and allow Poe to take center stage for the dramatic climax.Along with Cusack and Evans are Alice Eve, as Poe's love interest, Emily Hamilton, and Brendan Gleeson as her father. Through the course of the film, Emily will live through snippets of ""Masque of the Red Death"", ""Cask of Amontillado"" ""Premature Burial"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"". Good stuff. Tossed in for good measure are ""Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""Murders of the Rue Morgue"" along with poems ""Eureka"", ""Annabelle Lee"" and ""The Raven"".I, personally enjoy when characters of historical note are inserted with fictitious characters or alternative realities. For this reason, I am an avid fan of author Max Allan Collins, especially his Nathan Heller novels. THE RAVEN shows like one of those novels - quite entertaining, a macabre blending of fact and fiction, and a most enjoyable evening out.THE RATING FOR THE RAVEN = B",The Raven
132,afh179,"Cool atmospheric thriller, I was impressed",7,7 May 2012,"This movie had the potential to be really good or really bad. To be good, this would need three things: for the set design,costumes,and cinematography to be on point, for the acting to be exceptional (especially from Cusack), and for the story to be smart and unique while paying homage to the legendary Edgar Allen Poe. Fortunately, this movie did not lack any of these three things, and this made for an entertaining and worthwhile trip to the movies. We'll start with the best thing this film has to offer: an awesome performance from Cusack. He plays the troubled Poe pretty close to perfection, and proves his versatility as an actor. As if his performance wasn't enough to merit a viewing, the brilliant set design, costumes, makeup, and cinematography are four more reasons to check this one out. The aftermath of the killings are just brutal, the makeup team did an excellent job with this one. The movie's creepy, dank atmosphere owes much to the beautiful cinematography and brilliant costume and set design. The period is captured perfectly through these mediums, and make this movie that much more realistic. The originality of the story line should also be noted. While at first, the Edgar Allen Poe influenced murders may seem gimmicky, they actually make for an interesting and unique plot. It's also a treat as a Poe fan to watch some of his greatest stories come to life. Don't write this off as just a gimmicky, quasi-horror film, because it shouldn't be considered anything close to a horror film. What it is is an atmospheric historical thriller, and a very good one at that. Overall: 7/10",The Raven

At first I was dubious about John Cusack as Poe, but he and Luke Evans played well off each other. There are some ""Meh"" moments that feel contrived, but there are also some that made me chuckle.

But if you love Poe, this film will be even better.When you stop to think that this film was completely passed over at the Oscars, it makes you realize just how little that award means nowadays. Most of the films that won an Oscar this year were utter tripe compared with this film.""The Raven"" is very similar in tone to the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" with Robert Downey Jr. If you loved that film, you will love this one. ""The Raven"" is in the grand tradition of films that actually make you think, and present you with a human story instead of explosions and blurry karate sequences. This film has heart- a great tribute to a great man.",The Raven

138,isisinhouston,Worse than I expected,4,3 May 2012,"Anyone who wants to know about Edgar Allan Poe need only go to the expert writings of T. O. Mabbott. It would appear that neither John nor the authors are familiar with him which is very unfortunate, especially since John said he lost 25 pounds in preparation for the role. I was able to look past the Van Dyke beard since I had seen it in clips and tried to convince myself that this was somehow necessary to hid some perceived flaw in John's chin or mouth area or that somehow it would make his face look more drawn out and emaciated. Without any attention to his well tanned, robust looking skin, any attempt at emaciation is useless without good makeup, which in John's case was decidedly missing. Also missing was Poe's southern accent. Although it was slight, it was part of his writing and needed to be there to appreciate the rhymes and rhythms of his verse, especially in the scene where he is reading to the lady's group. Perhaps John should have watched the 1951 film, The Man With A Cloak to see how Joseph Cotten played the part of Poe. The fact that this was supposed to be the last week of an ailing mans life and seeing the character running all over Baltimore and riding around the countryside in gun fights is even more incredible. Poe also lived in the cottage at Fordham from 1846 until his death but the film would have you believe that he was rendered homeless when his rooms are burned in a fire. The love affair is complete fiction but I understand it was necessary to create the victim for the plot to work.The film itself is not bad for what it is. John brings his usual character to the part and that is not something I dislike. I was just disappointed that so much more could have been done.",The Raven

The visuals, the acting, everything. I went in thinking this movie would be alright but once I got to the end I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed watching it. Unlike other movie pieces that have real world famous people being thrown into unreal circumstances, this movie truly makes you feel it could have happened and that Poes expertise would have been brought in to help the police bring this madman to justice. Some parts do seem a tad modern clichéd set in old times but it still works. Though long it is a must see movie and you don't have to be a fan of Poe to watch it, though after-wards you will feel a compulsion to look up his works and read them.",The Raven

142,timmyjmcc,The Raven-Cusack spreads his wings!,8,16 May 2012,"Usually John Cusack is just that, John Cusack, and at times in the Raven he was still John Cusack. However, I felt he was able, given the story line, to spread his wings a little more than usual. He was given an opportunity to play a character, and a historical character, with a little flair. It's nice to see an actor take a risk once in a while or perhaps be given the opportunity to take a risk. There were several holes in the movie and moments of utter convenience, but that being said, have to go with two thumbs up on this one. I liked the look and the period of the movie and ALL the supporting cast from start to finish. I enjoyed the dialogue and its delivery, keeping in mind that Cusack as Poe had to deliver a different style of class in this film. He did his job and he did it well. Like to close in saying that intelligent movies, or at least somewhat more than the average run of the mill intelligent movies, should be made more often. I understand that movie makers or better yet producers and movie companies try to appeal to the masses, but even someone with no knowledge or history of the works of Edgar Alan Poe can enjoy this one, and maybe they'll even learn something along the way.",The Raven

Words like ""nuts"", ""OK"", ""stuff"" were simply not used in this time period. Inexcusable lack of research on the writer's parts. And the dialogue... ugh. One cliché after another, not even Cusack could make a believable character out of it. Amazing failure on the writer's part considering how often the subject matter would allow them to quote Poe. It attempted to be a realistic portrayal of what really took place in the last days of Poe's life, but was marred by silly, unrealistic actions sequences and Final Destinationesque gore. An attempt to appeal to both audiences that will likely appeal to neither. One is always willing to suspend disbelief when watching a movie, but this required one to leave their brain at the door. The only watchable part of the film was Luke Evans, who somehow managed to draw a straight line with this crooked stick of a script.",The Raven

And a good time I had! The acting was just fine. The plot was easy to follow. Character development was good. I usually can pick out the murderer in movies, but this one got away from me.

Yes, you may see it once, though you are not actually lose if you don't, and then totally forget about it. See it never again, never mention it in a conversation, never make the mistake of recommending it to a friend.John Cusack seems miscast in his role as the legendary writer Edgar Alan Poe and you might even say that his face expressions and mannerisms even make his portrayal hated. The rest of the cast supplements the protagonist just enough, the story is a cliché from begin to end, even the hole setup of the movie, intro and ending titles including, look like a parody.Did I enjoy it? No, not even enough to watch it all in one sitting. Off to bed as soon as I got sleepy and views the last half an hour of the movie the other day. In the meantime, I had totally forgotten about it.To sum things up, this movie just doesn't try enough nor even has the distinction of being a really bad movie.

146,mqdan,Could have been wonderful..........,4,8 November 2012,"An interesting view of Poe as a crime solver, the society of the day and the intricacies of being a ""commercial poet/writer"" in the 19th century. The writing and acting is crisp and moves the story along at a good pace involving the viewer deeply. Several surprises are paid off handsomely and the atmosphere of the movie is consistently superb.The reasons for my low rating are as follows: 1. The culprit is an aspiring, admiring writer not a Navy SEAL but yet is able to use weapons handily and pull off multiple physical maneuvers that would require serious training beyond that of his occupation.Not very plausible. and 2. The ending requires suspension of belief and is inconsistent with the Poe that's been developed along the way. He is a driven passionate man-of-action for the entire film, but then acquiesces to a binary choice handed him by the killer. The Poe developed earlier would have chosen a third course and subdued the killer - providing an opportunity to extract the information via other means. Again an implausible ending for Poe. Required plot rescue is accomplished by the final gunshot.It could have been great and wasted some good acting, hence the 4",The Raven
147,willworkman,"A Promising Idea, Utterly Squandered",3,15 October 2012,"Why this mediocre film got such good reviews is, well, a mystery. Perhaps viewers were so impressed with the concept that they overlooked the dull, shallow movie that was made from it. And it is a great concept. After all, Edgar Allen Poe invented the detective story, so what would make more sense than casting him as the world's first consulting detective? And since his work bridged the rational and supernatural, he could have brought the light of reason to seemingly impossible crimes, a device that worked so well in the recent ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies. But this Poe does no detection at all, he just stands around looking stunned or drunkenly demanding that dockworkers in a bar acknowledge his poetic genius.John Cusack is not up to the title role. When he should be melancholy and haunted he just looks bored, when he should be sick and haggard with worry he just looks like a slacker, when he should be horror-stricken he just looks like he's forgotten his lines. At other times, he's a bit of a fast talker and rogue, pulling stunts like sneaking into a swank costume party or leaping aboard his girlfriend's carriage to slip her a love note. This sort of thing worked beautifully in ""Shakespeare in Love"" because that film was set in Shakespeare's young Bohemian days. ""The Raven"" is set in the final day's of Poe's career, so the teen antics don't make any sense. Cusack also fails to establish the slightest chemistry with his lead, an improbable and forgettable bit of blonde candy.The writers have no ear for historical accuracy. Modern phrases like ""serial killer"" and ""I need you to focus"" litter the dialogue. Poe repeatedly uses his full name, though all fans know he hated the ""Allen"" surname. Fans also know that laudanum, not opium, was Poe's addiction. The booming shipyard town of Baltimore is completely wasted as a setting; all we see are a few carriages and the oh-so-expected underground.Much of this could be forgiven if the plot held any genuine surprises. But no, all we get at the end is a stock villain hissing ""I've always been an admirer of your work."" The ingenuity, or at least effort, that goes into some of the murders is completely out of the question for a lone villain. And yet somehow the fiendishness fails to be scary or even intriguing. Yes, the filmmakers even managed to make being buried alive dull.""The Raven"" is not good on its own, even compared to the forgettable CGI-powered stuff that passes for horror today. But compared to the movie it could have been, it's a huge disappointment. It should have been walled up in a cellar forever.",The Raven
148,kassolson,So-so,7,31 March 2013,"Thought Cusak portrayed Poe very well, and the visual portrayal of the time in Baltimore of long ago was great. Only was in the theaters for two weeks? Did not think it was quite so bad.Had problems with certain scenes, such as the man who turned out to be the villain being able to construct the pendulum. That scene was early, and had me leaning towards someone with a high mechanical/science aptitude being the villain- someone who would be able to construct such a contraption. And the scene at the church- was the villain an early Batman physical specimen? Perhaps the best summary is that the film could have been focused more on Poe and those writings he did to help save his Emily, and what was going-on with that, and maybe leave out a couple of the murders. Would say my biggest criticism was for the screenplay and Director's total package. Was gruesome, and did keep one's attention going, but not so sure Poe would have considered it worthy of his talents.",The Raven
149,armandomontelongo715,I wanted to like it,6,24 May 2013,"Hollywood has always tried to give us visual retellings of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. I was excited when reading about the Raven, seeing it as a combination of all Poe's most memorable works. It also stars one of my favorite actors from my younger days in John Cusack. That all being said, it just felt like it had all been done before. I had the end of the story figured out about a half hour into the film and spent the rest of the movie trying to close up the loopholes to the mystery before the film did.The cast was good. I thought Luke Evans was great as the curious and never satisfied Detective Fields. Alice Eve, as always, was breathtaking as the helpless heroine Emily. Then we come to Poe, played by a man I have always loved in his roles, Cusack. It was interesting to see Cusack's take of an elitist, eccentric and highly intoxicated Poe. There were parts of this movie where I really got into his character. However, it was hard to get past the fact that it was John Cusack playing Poe. It didn't feel like Edgar, just felt like Cusack. That's not a knock, mind you. One of my favorite performers of all time is the immortal John Wayne and he could only play one role, himself.That said, The Raven was a good thriller although the story does get a bit predictable in this revisionists tale of the last days of Edgar Allan Poe.",The Raven
150,bie-6,An enjoyable puzzling suspenseful story.,7,17 July 2012,"Fiction eats fact, Mr. Edgar Allen Poe, the ending days and his final creativity. Poe (played by John Cusack) is a ruined drunk, although poorly illustrated; he works for The Baltimore Times reviewing other writers' work. He loves Emily (Alice Eve) but her dad Colonel Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) dislikes Poe's person and work, they have a secret relationship behind the Colonels back.Two brutal murders, in a bizarre staged crime scene of a mother and her daughter, initiate the Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) to investigate the Poe story Murders in the Rue Morgue, and bring Mr. Poe in for questioning. The connection between Mr. Poe and the murders are too obvious and must be related.When a second murder (also based on one of Mr. Poe's stories) Now the cases really involves Mr. Poe as a key element for the investigation. The victim, who also writes for The Baltimore Times, wrote very negative criticisms of Poe's stories.A message found on the victim is boldly from the killer and directed towards Mr. Poe and whereabouts his next strike. The killer threatens his beloved Emily and the game is on.Fiction eats the facts and the movie mixes pleasurable enigmatic thriller elements and really becomes interesting, forward going and simple step by step story, yet intriguing and the filming is very interesting, the sets beautiful and even the lightning is greatly thought through, well used and well played.

There is many different stories about Poe's last few days of life and this one was one of them. If you know the history of Poe then this movie is just amazing and even if you don't really know Poe then movie is still great.

The characters either whisper so low and inaudible you strain to make heads or tails of what is being said, or the film is hitting you over the head with loud violence and gore. There is no depth to any of the characters, they feel like cardboard cutouts from a Disney period piece, silly cartoon like characters that dont even seem to take their roll serious so it feels more like an exercise in overacting. I was hoping for an atmospheric slow burn detective murder mystery, but this is more like a cheap carnival ride, avoid it unless you just need something mindless to keep you from boredom.",The Raven

The only difference is that the fact the detective character is a poet, and the killer is killing the same way as Poe's books and kidnapped his beloved, an extremely contrived way to get him to follow up on the case.The real detective is useless, who serves no purpose other than to ask Holmes, sorry, Poe for help.",The Raven
154,feixiang-films,Exciting. Riveting. Without room for fault.,8,16 May 2012,"Highlights (Full Summary Below) Pros: Tastefully made thriller that beautifully encompasses the mind of, not a serial killer, but a game-master who has challenged the character Edgar Allan Poe to a game of live chess. Each pen stroke, artistically developed creative prose that tells a murderous tall tale, is Poe's retaliating move to the killer's forward pressing pieces disguised as condemned victims. Exciting. Riveting. Without room for fault.Cons: For mysteries, it's best when the audience can feel like they can interact with the film by playing the detective as well. Unfortunately for ""The Raven"", unless you are an Edgar Allan Poe fanatic and are very familiar with his work, it's hard to stay a step ahead of the characters or even produce a slightly reasonable answer/hypothesis for each mystery in the film.——————————————————————————————————————————————–""Nevermore"", like the famous line from Edgar Allan Poe's literary work The Raven, the single word describes the desolation, desperation, sorrow that is portrayed through this film. Bringing a light to some of Edgar Allan Poe's life and also that time period with a cleverly weaved mystery, the 21st century audience is brought back to seemingly simpler times where literary work and subtle prose were forms of art that brought society together and gave spaces to dreams.""The Raven"" is not a gory, torture story like ""Saw"" or Jack the Ripper like some critics/review may state. The villain in ""The Raven"" shouldn't be compared to those serial killers (like America's very own Ed Gein – inspiration of Silence of the Lambs, Ted Bundy, or Mudgett ""Dr. Holmes"") who murdered for the joy of destroying their victims. ""The Raven"" created a mastermind whose target is Poe and finds fascination in the game of challenging other intellectuals. A game of chess. That point strongly separates this film above and away from the horror category of mindless killing sprees and into a mystery/adventure genre.Aside from a fascinating, interacting story development, ""The Raven"" is structurally pieced together beautifully and minute with holes for criticism. In all sense just like fashion, movies have only a select few plot development and story-telling techniques to use. ""The Raven"" is no different. E.g. starting off with a present view (or future), the audience is then taken to revisit the events that led to that first scene. Though not an outlandishly innovative film that creates 1st time experiences for the audience, ""The Raven"" does not reinvent the wheel but elegantly rides on it.Put simply – in an elegant, concise manner, ""The Raven"" keeps its focus on the story of murders and murderers. Romance, jeers, side stories are kept at a minimal, allowing the audience not too much but just enough to absorb in and stay continuously, deeply entrenched in the world of Edgar Allan Poe.Honestly, this is going to be one of my favorite films (and not just because I like the Romantic Movement).And thus I end my review of the film with a quote: ""Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.""""Nevermore""Edgar Allen Poe, The Raven.",The Raven

First of all,the casting of John Cusack in the role of Edgar Allen Poe,is completely ridiculous! This actor seems do be doing the same type of carefree,brilliant genius role that Robert Downey Jr. did so well in The Sherlock Holmes films,but with none of the comic flair.The actor from ""Winter Bone"", John Hawkes would have been perfect to be Poe,but Cusack is not dark enough as an actor to play this role. Also,in Sherlock Holmes, there was much chemistry between the actors,especially between Downey and Jude Law,this film does not have a grain of chemistry between the actors!The actress Alice Eve,is absolutely dreadful as Poe's love interest,if I never see her again in a film,it would be too soon! The plot is utterly unoriginal,you have seen this same type of material done better countless times before, any episode of The Showtime series ""Dexter""has 100 times the originality of this entire film!

157,bolbasor01,Liked but below expectations,5,30 April 2012,"Great and interesting concept but a little below my expectations. I admire Poe's writing and biography yet this film did not abide by it. Edgar Allan Poe( who suffered loss of loved ones, loneliness and depression)did not reflect completely on John Cusack's interpretation of the role. In the film The character was half drunk, did criticized but there was a ""humorous vibe"" that threw me off pertaining to the Horror and thriller genre and Poe's personality. There was no moment in the film where the tormented, bipolar and dark Poe appeared. Also the movie did not make me think in the sense that every time they found a crime the film immediately pointed out the story or poem, as a matter of fact it only took the first crime for the Detective to figure out that the murder was a reenactment of Poe's story, but according to the film itself Poe was not famous or even recognized. I did enjoy the relationship between Poe and Fields, It was interesting in the sense of the change from suspect to friend, from untrusted to relying on each other.Also the art direction and Costume design. The ball where ""The mask of the red Death"" was depicted was impressive and very detailed as well as Poe's town and the killers ""lair."" The movie is visually striking, emulating historical costumes and setting, but the story lack consistency. It was a wonderful and thoughtful ending to a defective and lacking plot due to failures in character developments ( not counting detective fields).

158,Ashman1977,Brilliant- Must watch,8,22 March 2012,"I am a big fan in general of ""WhoDunnit"" movies, and I was keen to see what 'The Raven' had in store. I went in assuming that it would be like any other 'Jack the Ripper'/19th century killer movie and that it would predictable. I was right in my assessment, but inspite of these cliché's the Raven was a brilliant film mainly because of the following:The movie was beautifully shot. It has a very 'sleepy hollow' feeling throughout. - The use of Poe's work and the poetic climax was excellent. I enjoyed this bit a lot as it left me with things to think about after watching the film, something which is testimony to the fact that the film made an impact. - Great character development of John Cusack/Poe. Made for a dark, mysterious man with a twisted view of the world. Exciting. - There were many tense moments, great chases and small pieces of puzzle solving( like in console games) making for small mysteries within one large mystery, thus keeping you engrossed all the way.To summarise, the Raven was riotous ride through Victorian era type settings, keeps you on the egde of your seat, the mini puzzles keep you busy and the plot and character development( Poe) was excellent, Definitely worth a watch and an 8 out of ten for me.P.S. The film has gore so if you can't stand that, don't watch it. It's not a Hostel or a SAW, but there is gore and blood.",The Raven
159,plebb-smith,A Work Of Art: The Raven,5,1 April 2012,"As an avid Poe reader, I was pleased to see the release of The Raven, and so I went to watch it. Upon entering the theater I will admit, my expectations were quite high. Edgar Allan Poe was a fantastic author and I was worried that his image and reputation would be slandered by the film. But I wasn't disappointed. The visual aspects were dark, as they should be, and although I am not a fan of John Cusack I felt his portrayal on Poe was spot-on, capturing his alcoholism and poetic nature completely. I will say that the ending made me cry, because it did. You don't just learn about this author, you feel for his character throughout and I was so saddened by his loss at the end, and it made for a more dramatic close to the film. If any negative criticism, it would be that the special effects concerning blood should have been tweaked a little bit more (it was rather 'splashed' and in reality would probably not have been as extensive) and also that the film should have focused a lot more on Poe's turmoil as a person than the turmoil of a loved one. Although a love story was an incredible asset to the film, I would've liked to have seen more of Poe's battle with himself. Overall, I give this film an 8 out of 10, it's a truly phenomenal flick and I hope people watch it, especially if you are a fan of Sleepy Hollow or From Hell! - K",The Raven

Even the actors (John Cusack, Alice Eve, and Brendan Gleeson), try their hardest to make this a genuinely thrilling film.

The works of Edgar Allan Poe have a dark, macabre feel to them while the movie seems to overlook this. I feel John Cusack was not the best person they could have cast to play Poe himself as it did not seem as though he could pull off the twisted mindset. The same could be said for most of the cast, as the characters were mostly underdeveloped and uninteresting. It would be fair to say the poor quality writing of the script is the downfall, as the movie looks good from a cinematic point of view. This is just a small nuance, but John Cusack's Poe had a full goatee. To some this probably doesn't even matter, but I found myself throughout the whole movie trying to picture if Cusack would be a better Poe with the appropriate facial hair.",The Raven

When I did get around to it though,I must say, it turned out to be a very good decision. The depth in this movie is immense, provided you are ready to see it. A lot of subtlety to the movie and the undercurrent of tension which is seen throughout. This isn't a movie in which the protagonist is shown to be a knight in shining armor but a very antisocial poet. The plot unfolds in a very structured way, with the killings shown to be very gruesome but meticulous. This is not centred around the killings though, but the mind of the killer, and that of the protagonist, making this a movie that has a fair share of gore, but is not horror. Coming to the performances, I believe they were all well done, with the antagonised Poe, the meticulous and driven, yet unsuccessful detective, the angry rich father and the daughter with a penchant for risk. I could not picture anyone else in the shoes of the respective actors, which goes to their credit, despite the fact that the female lead could have been a bit more expressive.Thank you for reading.

166,bshaffer940,A great story,9,2 January 2015,"Typically I can't stand movies that are based on historical characters, but this one wasn't to bad. It accurately portrays the poems from famous poet Edgar Allen Poe but to my knowledge he was never a detective. The role was preformed by Cusack was well done and very believable. This was a nice surprised after the several pieces of doo-doo that he has dropped on is of late. For the most part this movie was original and certainly worth the watch. Has something to offer almost every audience except those under 13 for there are several graphic scenes inappropriate for younger crowds, this suspense filled thriller has a decent twist to it the pulls the poet into the world of his mind when his poem are brought to life. The only flaw in this movie was there was quite a build up to the end and the movie failed to give it a good ending.",The Raven
167,davidgld19,The Raven - I Had to Wait For Some Satisfaction,5,16 July 2012,"Here in ""The Raven (2012)"" at the beginning of this film; gore, slash & hack may drive the characters instead of the characters driving the gore, hack & slash. This direction may result in poorly developed and unemotional story growth. This depends upon your personal dramatic tastes. For example, the movie ""Silence of the Lambs"" may have been written and directed in a more structurally effective emotional method that intends to compel audience involvement where at the end of the movie your heart begins to thump in your chest. When you look to the classical past to the dramatic plays of William Shakespeare, blood does not hit the floor driving characters into action. The character drives why the blood hits the floor. Here, the development of Edgar Allen Poe is that he's a pitiful, unsuccessful, manic, drunkard and people are starting to be murdered. We know nothing about the murderer. This vacuum about the killer does not compel.Firstly, for some reason I tend to categorize John Cusack with actor Shia LaBeouf. Both seem to display and act in sometimes inappropriate hyper-kinetic emotional and physical ways to dramatic plot motivations. This results in an unsuccessful attempt to compel a discerning audience into involvement with the story. I find myself attracted to subtleties & nuances. Subtle teasing, brief hints, misdirection, then pay off.Personally, there was no emotional immersion until 23-minutes 48-seconds before the end of this film. Getting to this moment was uncomfortable. The road was too bumpy and strayed from the final destination.""The Raven (2012) gets 5 out of 10 stars.",The Raven

This movie is a kind of intelligent crime fiction like SH. The actors in cast play their roles wonderful. The clues of the murders are amazing. But I am expecting a little bit more complex intelligent clues for the murders. Sherlock Holmes series are still better than this. Emily (Alice Eve) is very beautiful girl as a beloved of Edgar (John Cusack), but her role is limited just with ""as being darling"". The philosophy of the movie is clear. But sometimes, I am conflicting about these concepts (i.e. criminal subjects) that whether they should detailed in movies or not. Since, all criminals are inspired from those intelligent crime scenarios. Whatever... This movie is good one. I suggest to you..Have good time...",The Raven
169,sserio,A fulfilling experience!,9,2 May 2012,"This past Saturday, I decided to see a couple movies and one of them was The Raven. Knowing that the story is a fictional account, I decided to go in and just take the movie for what it was and not analyze it over historical misses or other such things that critics seem to hate. I live in Baltimore and love Edgar Allen Poe and have even been anticipating this movies release.Throughout the whole movie, I was enthralled with what I was witnessing on the screen and never once looked at my phone to check the time... a key sign that I am enjoying the movie. In fact, the only ambient influence that I noticed was the crowd reaction, which came at appropriate times for their given reactions. When the credits started rolling, there was even a small clap... a rare event at movie theaters these days.So, in closing, I would say not to listen to the professional critics who are often so full of themselves that all movies are beneath them anyway. Perhaps they just didn't like the death of a particular character in the movie (You'll have to watch it to see who... I don't want to spoil anything). But for me, this movie left me fulfilled and wanting more. The only disappointment was that my favorite Poe story was absent... The Black Cat.",The Raven

This I knew who the murderer was after five minutes but I kept watching till the end. It was that good, no great even. Creepy atmosphere, with fog laden forest and streets. Awesome casting by far for a great film. The special effects team definitely went to work on the prostetics makeup. Amazing devices that make the books in true life. It was a thrilling movie and I was thoroughly entertained for over an hour. John cussack was a wonderful Edgar Allan Poe, he played what Poe was probably like in person. Luke Evan's was a wonderful inspector too. He helped to make the film better even though it was great already. Keep an eye out for that man as he's really a hot ticket in movies.

This had to be a conscious decision of the director. It was a glaring lack right from the git go. That said, i thought it was great fun to watch. A few anachronisms and antebellum faux pas couldn't ruin the experience. Beautifully rendered, thrill ride sort of action. i have to admitted i even got scared a few times. it was worth paying full price, so don't wait for the matinée. It was nice to have an explanation for his end, a dark and romantic one at that. the raccoon was unnecessary, but adorable. there were many twists involving events from Poe's life, such as the chase ransacking a stage production of that Scottish play, and his mother's (who was an actress) name is on the poster. I look forward to the DVD with commentary. I think it would keep me busy. I just hope it has a dubbed version where Poe actually has a Virginian accent.",The Raven

It premiered on the big screen in 2012 and starred John Cusack who portrays the renowned American writer of the XIX century. It is an intriguing story characterized by suspense, in which the director (James McTeigue) and the screenwriters (Hanna Shakespeare - Ben Levingston) developed the film based on a series of murders caused by the same person, who followed in the footsteps of the Poe's tales.From there, Inspector Fields, played by Luke Evans, begins to investigate the crimes with the help of the writer.Clues from the different murders come from stories such as: The cask of Amontillado, The Tell-Tale heart or the poem titled Annabel Lee.In my opinion, it is difficult to find any flawed point in the film as it frames very well the visual effects, sound and the different dialogues that represent the writings of Edgar Allan Poe.

Both the poem an the movie are intriguing because they perfectly reflect Po's mind according to his problems and his dark side. This is the reason why the film is not flawed. It structure is circular and furthermore there are other Edgar Allan Po poems mentioned in the movie like: The Cask of Amontillado, The Tell-Tale Heart and finally Annabelle Lee. His unconditional passionate love for Emily is the same that the poet shows in the poem Annabelle Lee. I really liked this movie and I highly recommend it.

In real life, Edgar Allen Poe was an American writer, editor, and literary critic who is best known for his poetry and horror novels. In the movie, many of Poe's novels were combined to build a detective story. All of the murders were inspired by the plot of Poe's novels. The killer want kill Poe so he get Poe involved in these murder. The plot is very intriguing step by step. ""The Raven"" uses a unique perspective to portray the great writer and his literature. But, I think the plot about cause of Poe's death is flawed. He died because of poison in the movie, not because alcohol believed by some people. I guess this adaptation for the big screen makes the plot more logical. All in all, I like this movie. It's awesome. Because I love detective stories. I recommend this movie to detective lovers. But if you are not, the scenes will be a little bloody and violent for you. Also, I don't think it's suitable for kids under 14. Reading Poe's books is a good choice prior to the movie. ""The Pit and Pendulum"", ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and ""The Case of Amontillado"" are in the movie. These are his most famous.",The Raven

We liked John Cusack in the role. A lot of movies seem chaotic and poorly thought out. This rolled right along, to a satisfactory Poe like ending. The credits were unique and linked to the story itself. I rarely watch horror films, but going to see a movie about Edgar Allen Poe, I expected to see the Poe story lines--he's the original horror-suspense master. They played off these elements. We generally see a movie every week, and this one worked for us. Sherlock Holmes and Hugo had a lot of mindless running around. This one had a plot that hung together. I loved the costumes, the atmosphere, and old buildings.",The Raven
177,bbizzle,Awesome! Possible spoilers but nothing really just some comparisons to past films,10,24 April 2012,"First let me start my review by saying that I'm a fan of the Sherlock Holmes franchise and the film From Hell so I loved seeing an early screening of The Raven. It was the right combination of mystery, horror, thrill and even a touch of comedy. You can't help but laugh at some of Poe's comments. Speaking of Poe, I was hesitant to see John Cusack in the role. Like some of the comments I have read, I was thinking that Johnny Depp would be a good choice but I think Johnny Depp is an obvious choice and I have to say that Cusack was amazing. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to get out of my head (High Fidelity, Say Anything, Better off Dead, One Crazy Summer) but immediately in the first few minutes of the film, Cusack becomes Poe. I was drawn in during the first bar scene by his melancholy, arrogance and overall intense dislike. He's the anti-hero. I think the highest compliment came from my wife when she asked at the end of the film, ""do you think that really happened?"" because Poe is a historic figure. Now my wife is an ivy league graduate and sincerely very smart so please no rude comments but I had to chuckle. The film has an overall quality that appears to be historical fact. It's a tribute to the location and set design as well. So the story is a mystery that I was unable to solve. I actually got it pretty wrong and I'll need to see the movie again so I can watch it from the perspective of not trying to guess the killer. The film reminded me of Seven with Brad Pitt in that there are some chilling murders done in a calculated way by a smart and psychotic murderer. Overall, I recommend this film and I look forward to seeing it again. In the end, I'm not a critic and I like ALL film. I don't consider myself an intellectual. I'm a film fanatic and I only post when I really liked a film and think I can help with a review.",The Raven
178,kzintichmee-898-793279,Get the lead out? With a magnet?,10,30 April 2012,"John Cusack as Edgar A. Poe is heroic and pathetic at the same time. 'The Raven' put me in mind of the recent Sherlock Holmes movies and that is a good thing. Maniac is killing people according to Poe's stories and a Baltimore Homocide Detective recognizes the inspiration and drags Poe into the investigation against his will. When Poe's main squeeze gets kidnapped, he jumps in with both feet, packing heat and everything. Was really hoping for a knock down drag out fight at the end but oh well, you can't have everything. One quibble though, did doctors really think you could locate a lead bullet with a magnet? That bugged me from the moment it happened. It's not possible since lead is a non-ferrous metal.

Lots of gore, lots of dare and the entire film was shot beautifully and i think the period was captured superbly too.It was nearly a master piece but just missed out on this accolade by shoddy closure. 5 minutes shorter and it would have been a modern day classic.I would give it a robust 7.8.

180,innocentwanderer,"The movie will mostly hook the literature lovers,",7,24 July 2012,"The Raven is a 2012 movie directed by James McTeigue (known for V for Vendetta) and written by Ben Livingston & Hannah Shakespeare. The film features John Cusack and Alice Eve as the lead.The movie is based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe.Poe is famous for his writings on Mystery and Macabre. He is also said to be founding contributor for detective and science fiction genres. He is also known for his works on Gothic and dark romanticism. The title ""The Raven"" is based on his poem of the same name which was published in 1845 to a great success. Poe's last days are still a mystery. On October 3, 1849 Edgar Allan Poe was found wandering in the streets of Baltimore, delirious, calling out the name Reynolds. This movie is another attempt to explain the mystery of his last days.And so, this movie represents another theory as to what might have happened to Poe in his last days. If you don't like theory based movies far from the truth, don't watch it. If you think this is some horror movie that will scare you, you are wrong. Indeed this movie has horror but because it is gore. It isn't at all scary. The story is detective fiction which ironically was founded by Poe. John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe was okay. To be frank, I am not much judge of a acting or direction unless they are extremely low standard. And, I, didn't find them low standard. The story will mostly hook the literature lovers, someone who is fan of Poe or had read his work. The plot was based on his actual stories which made it all the more interesting. To the persons with interests in myths surrounding the artists of Renaissance era, like me, this movie was reasonably engaging. True! It wasn't some masterpiece but engaging surely and depending on your tastes, totally worth the money spend.",The Raven
181,lilkittie58,The most accurate portrayal of Poe I've seen yet,10,27 April 2012,"The Raven was an absolutely gorgeous movie.I highly recommend that every single one of you go see it. First of, let me say that you don't have to be a Poe fan to enjoy it. Anyone who enjoys drama, action, mystery, or horror will love this movie based on the plot alone. However, being a fan of his work certainly makes you feel like part of an inside joke. If you're a fan of his work, I'd recommend brushing up on your knowledge before you go to see it, though. I understood most of the references, but a few definitely made me go ""What story was that from again?"" which was at least slightly frustrating. John Cusack's portrayal of Poe was absolutely perfect, in my opinion. I'm sure we all have slightly different interpretations of what he was like, since we haven't really met him, but (coming from someone who's read most of his stories and studied a lot about his life) it really met all my expectations. His character was passionate, obsessive, and poetic. At times he seemed witty, at times he seemed completely mad, but there was never a moment when he didn't seem genius.And they really got his drinking perfectly. So many people try to portray him as being a sleazy drunken mad man, as though they've never actually read anything he's written. But I also wouldn't want it to be ignored completely, since it was certainly a factor in his life. They got it very accurate in this movie; they portrayed him as someone who certainly liked to drink, without making him seem like Barney (the local drunk) from the Simpsons. Over all, there wasn't a single thing I disliked about this movie. In my opinion, it was an absolutely perfect fascinating take on his life and his stories.",The Raven

For recent years we have been forced to only have sequels, remakes and/or animation. It is refreshing to see an all around good movie that focused on such a great and influential writer. Some say Robert Downey Jr would have did a better job as Edgar Allan Poe. I disagree, because John Cusack has a more natural sophistication that mirrors Poe and his writing style.

183,condedeabranoz,This movie was bad.,4,25 May 2013,"It's as if somebody tried to mix Sherlock Holmes with the life of a very famous writer (which makes sense, because one of Poe's stories inspired the character, but that's off subject, and I think whoever created this movie is too ignorant to even know that). They made this idiotic, vain, pompous, arrogant and attempted ""player"" out of Edgar Allan Poe to a point that I find offensive. Yes, he was a drunk, and yes, he never enjoyed success in his life, but I seriously doubt he would walk into bars flaunting himself and saying ""I'm Edgar Allan Poe, will you fools just stand in awe at my eloquence, How can you not realize the God that I am?"". Anyone who knows the life of this man, or at least read his works with some seriousness could tell you that he was probably a very quiet guy, with a drinking problem, who often locked himself in his place in the middle of the night, sticking to his reading and writing. The mediocrity of the script was enhanced due to the way Edgar Allan Poe was handled and mangled to fit into a dumb Hollywood film and his character changed entirely. Another thing: Clearly the identity of the killer was a last-minute random decision made by whoever wrote this piece of ...movie, we had never even heard of the guy until the end. And his motive? He had a thing for killing famous writers which led him (I'm laughing my ass off in sarcasm as I say this) to want to kill Jules Verne as well. I believe he even said to Poe ""You remind me of him"". Seriously? How can Edgar Allan Poe even remotely remind anyone of Jules Verne? If you don't admire or don't care about Edgar Allan Poe, this movie will still be bad, only you won't be deeply offended by it, hell, you might even enjoy it. Sometimes I like watching bad films if I'm bored enough. Peace!",The Raven
184,joe-a-south,"Nothing like the poem, you incompetent cow!!!",1,27 September 2013,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. ''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door Only this, and nothing more.'Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying emberwroughtitsghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore - For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Nameless here for evermore.Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, 'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; - Darkness there, and nothing more.Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!' This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!' Merely this and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. 'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'Tis the wind and nothing more!'Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door - Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door - Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, 'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no craven. Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore - Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!' Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.'Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door - Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door, With such name as 'Nevermore.'But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only, That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered - Till I scarcely more than muttered 'Other friends have flown before - On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore Of""Never-nevermore.""'This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted - On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore - Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!' Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.''Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore - Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore - Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels nameLenore?' Quoth the raven'Nevermore.''Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting - 'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door! Takethybeak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!' Quoththeraven'Nevermore.'And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted - nevermore!",The Raven

The story begins with the murder of a mother and her daughter.

The scene that left the strongest impression is of a man who was killed by pendulum with a giant sword. His body was literally cut in two pieces. This was far-fetched, though. The most intriguing part is that the real criminals was not Edgar Allen Poe, yet a killer who always committed murders based on Poe's works. Therefore Poe was a always suspect. In the last scene, you will be surprised when you figure out who the criminal is. I rated it an 8 because I liked it very much but It is a little bit grotesque. I don't like these types of scenes so much. If you're a lover of grotesque, scary, or mystery movies, I bet you'll like it.

This movie is mesmerizing for fans of Edgar Allan Poe because we can watch many tricks Edgar made. we can also feel the period of the time he lived from town, clothing and people. ideally I would rather the actor of Edgar acted more intelligently",The Raven
191,drdebiblackbourn,Love Cusack as Poe,10,26 March 2019,A fun mystery that keeps you guessing and what is not to love with John Cusack . Haters will hate but this is really a good film!!!!!,The Raven
192,mercuryplanet,watch THIS?!,8,18 March 2021,"This movie can be appreciated probably one way. Watch the movie at home in the right immersive ambience (see: rainy and questioning your own existence), then reroll with audio commentary of director & producers. The props, production, lighting, art engineering are all riveted into the success of this film. Shining brick sheen, palpable shadow work, brave symbol work of still pieces.
Few scenes suffer from imagining something better, wanting more.3 things set it apart from Murder on the Orient, Sleepy Hollow, From Hell, etc.
Actor Casting: 2 alpha male leads (hard to mesh & foil at once), every actor is spot on cast in their role, even super minor roles, and John Cusack imbues some serious wrinkles in a dynamic Poe rendering with necessary grandiloquence.
The leaps of logic that string along the mystery that stay tantilizing out of guesstimation UNLESS you're a Poe aficionado anyway and CAN make out what's next. Inside secrets are so superficially cool!
And 3, The pacing. Almost all period piece hybrids (see: V for Vendetta or 300) pace like a Nirvana song--too breakneck slow, fast. This film KNOWS its 21st century pretty, masculine, while turning the wheel of time as close as possible back to 1849.",The Raven
193,boratatoo,The way Poe would have done it,8,13 May 2012,"The movie was just the way a true fan of Poe would have wanted. Very dark and well acted, even my HS son and college son who both are Poe fans thought this movie well done. My husband and boys thought it was so enjoyable we had not noticed 2 hours had gone by. Fast paced need to pay attention, not a movie for people who insist on texted during the movie! Intelligent and dark but showed humor as well. The critics are a bunch of blow hards we almost didn't go since the reviews were so bad I even read one critic say there was no ending to the plot he needs to see this again and this time stay for the whole movie and actually pay attention. If you are a fan of Poe this is a must see.",The Raven
194,usins1,".The Raven is an excellent movie. It is in the tradition of Poe's original mysteries,.",9,18 November 2012,"""The Raven"" is John Cusack's finest film performance to date. Shakespeare and Livingston's writing capture the feeling of Poe's psychological thrillers in a way that would have made Poe smile at The Raven. Since Poe's biography has been besmirched so badly over time, the historical inaccuracies become fictional license, and therefore, worthwhile. For instance, having Griswold die from ""The Pit and The Pendulum"" is poetic justice to the historical man who was left to care for Poe's work and intentionally changed Poe's letters to create a myth of the man. However, the drama is high. The action is good, and the gore is acceptably tolerable. I loved this movie.",The Raven
195,pyloudis-259-573001,you have definitely better things to do !,1,6 July 2012,"What was the thing about the noise in this movie?--SOME Spoilers might be included---Almost every character screamed senselessly at least once. So much noise for no reason. Were was the suspense or the climax in that? Just cheap tricks to make you...well...scared? I'd say bored. The crime scenes were utterly disgusting or laughing stock even at times. The plot was lacking gusto. Too clichéd. As for the acting, it was the real horror in this film. Except for Cusack sometimes.. everyone else was lukewarm, or truly non-believable. Poe's fiancée was totally irrelevant. The detective...exaggerating it.Poe must be swearing in his grave LOUDLY about this! Do such film creators have NO mercy for literature? or US?",The Raven
196,dsmeek40,not Sherlock Holmes,5,26 April 2012,"It thought the movie was weak throughout. Cusack is another one of those actors (like Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves) who can only play himself. He is never the character, and this doesn't help the film at all because it isn't Poe we are watching; it is Cusack. He's not engaging like RDJ's Sherlock or even fun like Depp's Ichabod Crane (Sleepy Hollow). His character is hollow, and I didn't feel for him once, even at the end. That said, the actress that played his love was much more engaging, even though she was only half the love equation, the other half, of course, missing from an emotionally bland Poe.The settings were great and the action and suspense (and there is some gore) is pretty good, but because Cusack is so lame, one never gets the sense of urgency and despair about his love being kidnapped and perhaps dying. You don't get it from him; from her, you get a lot.Perhaps the best actor in the entire performance, is the villain, and this is the real tragedy because you don't get to meet him until the very end, and then it's over. He has his moment, and he is terrific, more engaging than even Moriarty opposite Sherlock. I think if we'd gotten more of this man throughout the film, it would have been much better, or if we had had a better actor than Cusack, one who could sell the part of a tortured soul, the movie would have been worthy of its namesake.",The Raven
197,ryanbursik,John Cusack is not looking so good anymore,3,16 May 2012,"So I saw the preview for the raven a month or so back and was intrigued by the premise of the film. I loved from hell so I thought that I might be able to relive some of that with this film. If you don't know the premise of the movie already then go somewhere else. With that being said, I felt that it was just blah. No groundbreaking stuff here literally your average serial killer mystery with poe stories to spice up killings and a deflated twist at the end. Quite frankly I feel that John Cusack has lost his touch and he looked very out of place when walking around the cheap set of London in the film, His name or face just doesn't hold the power that it used too and it shows due to this movie, Why was he cast in this film? it made no sense to me. I love the man, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't help but think that depp or downey could have dominated this film, cusacks attempt at being the funny eccentric writer/ detective that drinks too much was not convincing and I felt that he was predictable and boring as Poe. Is the movie unwatchable ? no , its entertaining if you don't want to think hard what so ever and your idea of a good time is watching a actor on the wrong side of 40 flailing around London trying to re enact the glory days of his once promising career. Unfortunaetly this movie is a hard one to justify to go see because there is just too many other films out there that are much much better. I'll end my review with this, there was 1 other couple in the theater when I saw it.",The Raven
198,prettyemmathomas,A Brief Horror Fans Opinion,8,10 March 2012,"I'll be honest I wasn't sure about how good this movie would be, and I'm not really a fan of John Cusack. I has surprised though, I thought it was one of his better movies, but saying that it was hard to get wrong with such a good script. I am more than familiar with writers and It showed very much how you would expect a writer to act and speck, no one can say how he was in real life but we can guess and my guess would be very similar to this. Of course everyone is likely to imagine people differently, but I hope they will agree it fairly accurate to expectations how he would actThe film it's self wonderfully directed, with a dark eerie glow representing the time it is set in. Slight theme of the raven going on there (dare someone to count how many actually appear in the movie). This movie is extremely gory, I wouldn't recommend it to any one squeamish. It is nice to find a movie though there the violence is far more realistic, non of this slit someone's throat and all they have is mild scratch. Over all I really enjoyed the film, my only real fault with it is that they could have built more suspense in parts, especially in a thriller movie. I you don't mind the blood and gore and fancy something a little different I would recommend the film",The Raven
199,marek-maurizio,Awful,1,14 April 2012,"Poe is a whiny character nobody will like. The crimes have nothing to do with the original stories. They are uninteresting. Oh look! A big razor! A raven! That's enough to call it a day, now let's make a crappy movie and make millions. The script makes no sense. Big holes. One moment Poe is surrounded by policemen, the other he is alone chasing an assassin. Why him? Then he gets shot and, does he look for cover? No, he just sit down, in total open space, and nobody kills him. But moments later he gets shot at again. And then explain please, why Verne? The idea should be that the killer recreates the killing as in the books (let alone it's not happening due to the general poorness of the movie). Why was Verne his next target?? What was the plan? Building a submarine? It's not even scary. Poe was scary as hell. Why should one be scared of being buried alive? Even a maiden in his dancing dress can break free with her bare hands, like any other trash action American movie. Don't waste your time. Authors of the movie should be ashamed of themselves.",The Raven
200,Hameth,Best film of 2012 so far!,10,10 March 2012,"WOW!A thoroughly enjoyable murder mystery thriller with some true story facts to act as a real hook! At the very least, it's a fantastic story, the acting is brilliant (good to see Alice Eve and John Kusack in action, but many other brilliantly portrayed roles in addition to them). The cinematography made for an engrossing film that you will definitely enjoy. The pace makes for 2 hours of something engaging and gripping. There's plenty in it to make you jump but it's not gratuitous and adds to the fabulous dark atmosphere that has been brought to us by the same director as V for Vendetta. If you're tired of the constant comic book based films or needing something with more depth than Jason Statham's acting, this film will help fill the void. Go see it.",The Raven
201,Angelina-356-434900,Explosive!,10,28 April 2012,"April 28, 2012 By Angelina de Mourier.Today, I went to see ""The Raven,"" a mystery thriller set in 1849, the actual time Edgar Allan Poe lived, my January 19th born master of macabre poetry, (though if one were to read his real-life quotes, one would be astonished as to witness such love; ""We loved with a love that is more than love."") He died, rather mysteriously, at age 40.What Director James McTeigue aspired to do was brilliantly accomplished, in this epic work of mystery which incorporates the actual life of Poe with fiction.Phenomenal achievement, really, as to lace them, oh, so integrally. I salute him, as Poe would have done in his days at West Point, which were mentioned in the movie along with his two loves; first his young cousin of a wife who died of Tuberculosis, first signs truly evident at the piano, as mentioned, and the other love, of his sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster. The $9 he was paid for his first publication was incited, his disdain for Longfellow, as well as a myriad of his actual prose of known works from, ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" all the way to ""Annabel Lee""...which brought the killer into the labyrinth of the fiction element of this film. My heavens, they even included the last publicly known words of Poe, ""Lord, help my poor soul.""John Cusack's performance was explosive! And his lines of the time I cherish so, were perfectly articulated with the passion they should be!And not too many present-day special effects, except a close-up of a slow-moving bullet, which was actually a fabulous adornment.C'est Magnifique is all I can say of this movie...of course I did close my eyes to the more bloody scenes, which flitted as fireflies on a summers night. So be it.Oh yes, and I dearly loved these inscripted words to touch my heart, said by Cusack/Poe:""If I would have known my work would have such an effect on people, I would have devoted more of my time to eroticism.""Well, my dear Edgar, how honored I am as to cover that for thee, in ""My Secret Husband.""Most grateful to have had the opportunity to view this production. Truly, Angelina de Mourier",The Raven

(If that makes sense haha) Anyways when going to see this with my boyfriend I was like..ugh this is going to be the sort of thing I fall asleep to when I'm home. I was rather surprised, it wasn't really scary which was good considering I just wanted a chilled out movie but not comedic nor all typical drama mystery-ish. I have read Poe's work throughout my life at one time or another where as my boyfriend really hadn't or couldn't remember. (hah) Yet he still enjoyed it too, which I didn't really expect.

I liked a lot John Cusack's act (it's been awhile without seeing him in a good performance), I think the twist he made on Poe's character was brilliant, also I think Luke Evans was awesome too.The connection between Poe's novels and every crime scene, very very good match. I have to admit that I found out about Reynolds at almost the very end of the movie, so I was captured by the script, very nice I recommend this movie in case you have no other to watch, I went to see the movie expecting an OK movie and I left the cinema with a big surprise, two thumbs up!!",The Raven

205,chdawson74,Romantic end to Poe's life,7,2 August 2012,"There was always speculations about Poe's last days. This seemed to make a better ending to the poet's life. The setting makes the movie really interesting and the suspense buildup is just right as one by one the facts unravel.This is a good movie. A detective hunt for the madman who's making Poe's poems into life. Plus, the romantic feel of the movie makes it even more interesting, as people are kept in the dark until the last moment as to who the serial killer. Poe, the morbid storyteller, trying to find the woman he loves, writing a new story to lure out the serial killer. The scenes are a bit gross but it's tolerable.I recommend not watching it with kids around. Anyone would enjoy it! I did.Review provided by http://drbrent.com/",The Raven
206,the_hackmaker,Brilliant movie!,10,29 August 2012,"I have no idea why its rating is so low, and why people find it not so exciting. This movie is one of the greatest pieces of art I have ever watched. Its plot is very original and obsessive, and the actors played wonderful, especially Cusack. His look and the way he played Poe are enough to watch it as it is outstanding. Before I see ""The Raven"" I have never heard of this actor, but he appears now to be one of my favorite. There was something very human and deep in the storyline. Not just the events but the description of all emotions and the way Cusack expressed them as Poe. Moreover the direction was also incredible, every detail and every move were some kind of realistic and professional. ""The Raven"" is surely in my top 10 of the best movies ever.",The Raven
207,lothian_p,"Terrible. Trust me, I thought it through.",2,21 June 2013,"This film beings with ""On October 7, 1849, Edgar Allan Poe was found, near death, on a park bench in Baltimore, Maryland. The last days of his life remain a mystery."" I loved it, in fact I was so intrigued I googled it. Well the last sentence was right. That rather set the tone of the film from then on for me. Not only was Poe found on the 3rd of October but everything people know about his character was mainly formed by a man named Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Griswold and Poe were enemies for years however Griswold somehow held Poe's literary rights and wrote the biography on Poe which seems to have inspired the characterisation of Poe in this film. Griswold depicted Poe in the way he wanted to, whatever Poe was actually like we will never know thanks to Griswolds slander. That said I have always loved John Cusack, his performances (no matter the general standard of the film) are always great. He worked extremely well with the hand he was dealt and had someone else been Poe I would not have watched past that opening text. Other than Cusack the film is aesthetically very nice to look at and the actors are trying their best with with a ham-fisted script full of clichés and bad lines. Along with the inaccuracy surrounding the dates of Poe's death which I can forgive (everyone should be allowed artistic licence) the second victim is Ludwig Griswold (which is the pen-name of Rufus Wilmot Griswold). I understand that stories will bend the truth and take artistic licence but isn't killing the man that wrote Poe's obituary and subsequent biography taking that licence too far? Ignoring my annoyance at those details (and possible nit-picking behaviour in noticing them). I found the story to have little substance. I loved the idea of it and read the positive reviews but it makes too many silly mistakes (using a magnet to retrieve a lead bullet? Really?) and the script doesn't hold up to scrutiny. It was boring. My advice if you want to waste an afternoon watching something pretty go for it, however if you have more than two brain cells and access to Google, find something else.",The Raven

The exquisit special effects and cinematography made the gruesome murders in the film feel that more tangible. Although there were the occasionally plot holes evident in every movie, the story's quick-pace plot ran smoothly and kept the viewer engrossed in the characters' conflict.

There were several times that I leaned forward in my seat in suspense and then recoiled backward with my hands over my eyes! As soon as the movie was over, I searched the Internet to try and find details on who wrote this, who directed it, and for the names of the cast members. The clues came faster and faster toward the end; Poe and Fields were figuring it out separately and simultaneously and all I could think was, ""Hurry! Hurry!"" The ending was perfect because it wasn't ""and they all lived happily ever after."" When Poe found Emily, you could feel the true love between them. Poe's words while he carried her were beautiful. The first words that were narrated at the beginning of the movie, began to sadly sink in at the end when you see Poe sitting on the bench.

It's overacting when Poe sitting on a park bench. And I don't know the reason that the killer wanted to kill Poe. I think if the director put more scenes on the killer, the movie would be more interesting and more reasonable.Poe's player did quite a good job if we ignore the last scene that Poe died of the poison.
