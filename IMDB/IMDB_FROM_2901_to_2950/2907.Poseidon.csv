0,TheLittleSongbird,"Bloated and forgettable, but the special effects are great",4,1 June 2010,"Starting with the good things, it is brilliant technically and visually. The cinematography is great, the editing is crisp, the special effects are superb and the set-pieces are somewhat exciting. Plus the music score is pretty good.However, it is very much inferior to the wonderful 1972 film in terms of script, story and acting.The script is clichéd and cheesy at times, the story is bloated as a result of cramming too many plots and situations in, the pacing is uneven being rushed one minute and draggy at other parts and the characters lack depth. Also the acting isn't great, Josh Lucas is a bland lead while Kurt Russell tries his best to elevate the adventure but the script sets him adrift. It is pretty much the same with Richard Dreyfuss and Emmy Rossum too. Overall, was great visually but it is bloated and forgettable. In some ways it is an example of a movie that is all style and little substance. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Poseidon
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not as good as the original, of course, but for a no-brainer it's fun",6,12 October 2016,"This modern-day remake of a 1970s disaster classic is pretty much what you would expect from a state-of-the-art disaster epic: it's full of non-stop action, thrills and spills and boasts some stunning CGI effects. If you're looking for more, though, then you're going to be disappointed as that really is all there is to it. The film kicks off straight away as we meet the Poseidon (in one of the few unconvincing special effects in the film) and the various diverse characters whose fates we will follow for the next hour and a half. Barely ten minutes in, the disaster occurs in an absolutely brilliant, overwhelming piece of cinema. From then on, our survivors battle against the odds to make their ways to safety and the suspense and excitement never lets up.Those expecting subtlety or wisdom should look elsewhere as POSEIDON has neither. Instead, it has a string of good-guys-in-peril situations, ranging from crossing dangerous heights to fighting their way out of a flooding air vent. Things begin spectacularly and stay spectacular and I enjoyed every second of what was going on. Wolfgang Petersen can be depended upon to deliver a decent sea film and I found myself enjoying this more than THE PERFECT STORM, even though it has none of the characterisation or realism of that film. Petersen has assembled a good cast, headlined by newcomer Josh Lucas reminding me of Thomas Jane and old hand Kurt Russell putting in a rugged, decent turn. The unknown female actors are uniformly good as is a surprisingly understated Richard Dreyfuss. The only person I didn't like was Kevin Dillon, whose bolshie, OTT portrayal of a gambler seems to belong to a comedy and not this.The CGI effects are expertly done and too numerous to mention, but I enjoyed every moment of the peril. Another surprise was the film's level of death and brutality; the most effective scene is set in a lift shaft where one character is put in a life-or-death dilemma. It's hard-hitting stuff, and I was astonished to see the burning and exploding bodies in a 12-certificate film. Come the movie's climax, there's time for some sentimental stuff and some kid-in-peril scenarios, but I didn't mind that as the film had already delivered what the trailer offered. Sure, POSEIDON is a no-brainer, and yes, it's a remake we didn't really need...but it's a darned enjoyable one at that.",Poseidon
2,SnoopyStyle,"Characters uninvolving, some unreasonable big action",5,16 September 2013,"The great Wolfgang Petersen is reduced to directing a remake of a disaster movie. That's the sad truth. This is an unimaginative by-the-book disaster movie, and he can't inject any more than a few action scenes into this.At the beginning, we're introduced to the characters. Luckily this goes by fast and we're quickly into the action. The ship is hit by a rogue wave and turn upside down as in the original. Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas co-lead the group. Kevin Dillon is the cartoony annoying Lucky Larry. Also in the group are Jacinda Barrett, Richard Dreyfuss, and Emmy Rossum.The characters are uninvolving. The trick is to pick one lead character, and tell it from that character's POV. When you've got Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas, either one would do. Get the audience involved making one of those our lead.The action scene are silly over the top. But there's value in that. It's just they couldn't possibly save this movie.",Poseidon
3,Prismark10,The big wave,6,12 June 2014,"Poseidon is a less cheesy remake of the 1970s disaster classic The Poseidon Adventure. Apart from the title and a giant wave the film share no similarities.Poseidon is a little po faced and maybe needed a bit more self deprecating humour. Poseidon is a giant CGI ship and looks it. Maybe they should had a model ship to make it realistic.The film immediately introduces its various cast of characters with Josh Lucas as the chancer and Kurt Russell and the solid and staid type. The most amusing scene is Richard Dreyfuss as the jilted lover who is preparing to end it all until he sees the giant wave and decides he rather live.The ship is hit early on and pretty soon random strangers die in spectacular falls, fires, explosions and crashes. Our small core group of characters leave Fergie and co behind as they try to escape from the ship and encounter all sorts of hindrances. A few will fall and some will make sacrifices.Its enjoyable enough hokum from director Wolfgang Petersen, the film is not too long but I expected something more deeper from the director of Das Boot.",Poseidon
4,claudio_carvalho,Awful Remake,3,17 December 2006,"On the New Years Eve, the luxury passenger vessel Poseidon is hit by a huge wave and capsizes. A group of survivors tries to find a escape route through the propeller tunnel.The original 1972 ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is one of the best disaster movies of the 70's, with a good screenplay, engaging characters and great special effects. Wolfgang Petersen's version is a disappointing remake, with an awful screenplay, nasty characters and great special effects. Kurt Russell, for example, plays a former fireman and later the major of New York. The way he gambles, he certainly earned lots of money in corruption, since I do not see any explanation for a man that was a fireman to have such amounts to bet in a table of poker. His daughter is a bitch, capable of spoiling a bet of her father. The ""hero"" Dylan is another selfish gambler and opportunist. Richard Nelson kills Valentin to save his own life. Lucky Larry is a scum. And so on. Therefore, practically most of the characters of this film are non-charismatic. In the end, I was hoping that the vessel sinks and kills everybody, including the director, writer and producers of this crap. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Poseidon""",Poseidon
5,kosmasp,Badder than it's pieces (i.e. Actors & Original),5,6 May 2007,"Yes you've got actors here, that are worthy of that label, but they don't (or better are not able to) show it here! And that all with a good story (see the original to get the goodies out of the story) to begin with! Yes this movie has state of the art special effects, which are incredible, but is that really all you care about? If so, than watch this movie, with no regret. But if you really want drama and suspense and a real feeling for the characters (not fleshed out at all and very unappealing, one of the most interesting being Kevin Dillon, but ... let's say that they do give away many possibilities they had with him!) then go for the original! It's less technical, but therefor more human!",Poseidon
6,jboothmillard,Poseidon,4,28 September 2009,"The original Poseidon Adventure with Gene Hackman is a brilliant disaster movie, and this was the attempt by director Wolfgang Petersen (Dad Boot, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One) to remake it. You know the story, just after celebrating New Year, the large cruise ship Poseidon is hit by a humongous tsunami (tidal wave) in the middle of the North Atlantic ocean, and turned upside down. So a small group of survivors start climbing upwards to reach the bowels of the ship and escape through the propeller ducts. The only real difference are the methods they use to go upwards, the range of survivors, e.g. there's no fat woman (like Shelley Winters) or priest (like Hackman); and when they do get out in the end, they get into a inflatable rubber dinghy and are nearly hit by the ship and its sinking wave. Starring Josh Lucas as Dylan Johns, Kurt Russell as Robert Ramsey, Jacinda Barrett as Maggie James, Richard Dreyfuss as Richard Nelson, Emmy Rossum as Jennifer Ramsey, Mía Maestro as Elena Morales, Mike Vogel as Christian, Kevin Dillon as Lucky Larry, Freddy Rodríguez as Marco Valentin, Jimmy Bennett as Conor James, André Braugher as Captain Bradford and The Black Eyed Peas' singer Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson as Gloria. The spectacle and special effects are certainly enough to keep you interested, but (and I'm sure I'm not the only one who says this) the original is much more thrilling and a true classic. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Remake or Rip-Off. Okay!",Poseidon
7,Woodyanders,"Not bad, but inferior to the original",6,15 May 2006,"I was expecting this film to be much worse than it was. It's passable and enjoyable enough, but the original was superior in many ways. For example, the original took its time developing the characters before the big wave hits the boat and capsizes it. Here we get roughly twenty minutes of sketchy character development and then BAM! The wave hits the boat and a motley assortment of cardboard cut-outs ... oops, I mean characters -- Kurt Russell as a former firefighter and mayor of New York, Emmy Rossum as his hottie daughter, Josh Lucas as a slick gambler, Richard Dreyfuss as a depressed gay architect, and so on -- struggle to get out of the ship before it sinks. Another problem is that it's fairly predictable as far as who lives and who dies. For instance, Kevin Dillon's obnoxious loudmouth loser meets a totally expected untimely fate. Freddy Rodriguez's helpful waiter likewise buys it early on just like Roddy McDowall before him. However, the death of two other characters later on did really surprise me. A third big flaw is the fact that nobody notices a humongous tidal wave in advance. I mean, wouldn't there be a sophisticated radar on the ship which would spot this enormous thing? I guess not. And exactly where in the great big sea is this gargantuan luxury liner? We are never told or find out. And the fact that there just happens to be a life raft with a flare gun in it for our survivors to board at the movie's end is a laughably ludicrous contrivance which totally negates credibility. Clearly, the script here is seriously lacking in substance. So why am I giving this honey a 6 out of 10? Well, for starters the cast all turn in solid performances: Russell makes for a properly strong and stalwart lead, Lucas has roguish charm to spare, Rossum is very cute and appealing, and Dreyfuss is his usual reliable self. Wolfgang Petersen's commendably tight and brisk direction keeps the movie rattling along at a steady clip; there are no lulls to speak of. The breakneck pacing is both the film's greatest strength and biggest weakness at the same time. Sure, there isn't a dull moment, but you never truly care about the characters because they are given precious little screen time to effectively register as sympathetic human beings. Thankfully, we don't get any hammy histrionics from the admirably serious cast. The tension does build to a stirring and absorbing fever pitch as the film plugs along. The overturned ship is believably dangerous and littered with dead bodies (a nice realistic touch in a film that's otherwise largely bereft of plausibility). And the special effects are both awesome and convincing; the capsizing of the ship in particular is a genuinely exciting and harrowing set piece. So overall this ain't half bad, but the original was much better.",Poseidon
8,rmax304823,Down Into the Sea in Ships.,2,21 June 2007,"In the original ""Poseidon Aventure,"" (1972)we saw something original -- a handful of survivors exploring an upside-down ship, searching for an exit through the exposed bottom. There was something eerie and unsettling about seeing familiar surroundings vertically reversed. The men's urinals and the toilets hung from the ceiling, the galley ranges still with their gas flames lighted and burning overhead.I didn't see the next remake or sequel or whatever it was (1979) but I did make it halfway through this one and it isn't even fun to look at. A viewer doesn't get a sense of being in a capsized ship but instead in a giant junkyard with mammoth objects strewn about. Disorder, yes, but not insanity. Whatever small poetry there was in the original is lost in this dumb remake which is no more, really, than a special effects extravaganza.We've come a long way in the 35 years since the original was made and nobody is more aware of that than the people who put this monstrosity together. If there were any gruesome reasons for death left out in 1972, that's taken care of here. A huge generator plummets through the deck overhead and takes out Kevin Dillon, the wisecracking, drunken villain (a figure absent from the first version). Dangling cables electrocute passengers spectacularly. Fried bodies float about in the water. The editing is lightning fast. The cuts that may ordinarily be measured in units per minute must here be measured per second. The target audience was weaned on computer games, MTV, and CocoaPuff commercials.No acting can be discerned among the cast of slightly past-their-prime professionals like Kurt Russel and Richard Dreyfuss, nor among the inexpensive younger cast members, but then none is called for. Any auditions must have demanded not much more than an agonized scream.I kept waiting for something to happen, something human I mean, something besides gushing water and underwater people banging on stuck hatches. Why didn't the babes at least remove their hampering outer garments if they're going to swim through all that sharp, entangled garbage? They had the good sense to do that in the original. And if Stella Stevens in the original had something on besides her underwear, at least there were Pamela Sue Martin and that blond in short shorts. Here? Not a chance.The plot in essence does follow the original but it's as if the original had been attacked by a horde of deranged mechanical engineers. Every opportunity for ratcheting up the tension works.Something other than the SS Poseidon was wasted here. Wolfgang Peterson made the phenomenally (and deservedly) successful ""Das Boot."" Surprisingly effective performances come from Richard Dryfuss, Josh Lucas, and Mia Maestro as the lovable but superstitious Latin Amertican peon. I defy anyone to watch Carlos Sauras' ""Tango"" and come away unimpressed by Maestro's talent and radiant beauty. If you're into untrammeled sea water, noise, quick cuts, screams, and heroic children you might want to watch this. Or -- and this might be more constructive -- take a shower. Actually, when they make the next remake, I hope the rogue wave catches the ship and tears it apart at once, drowning or disarticulating everyone aboard. The movie will then be five minutes long.",Poseidon
9,ma-cortes,Spectacular and engrossing remake with handsome casting,6,8 October 2007,"This formula disaster movie from Wolfgang Petersen deals about the famous luxury cruise ship turned over by giant tidal wave leaving group of survivors and hopefully scape, attempting save themselves. One time of wreckage of Poseidon during New year's eve the survivors from liner passenger looking for dangerous ways to survive. Meanwhile is developed romance and emotional byplay between various couples, Emily Russum-Mike Vogel, Josh Lucas-Jacinda Barrett, Richard Dreyfuss-Mia Maestro and relationship among parents and sons : Kurt Russell-Emily Russum and Jacinda Barrett-Jimmy Bennett.This high budget remake mingles action, intrigue, disaster spectacle , suspense and quite entertaining though plenty of clichés. Our heroes get stuck in the ship before it sinks and suffering risks, dangers and death. The protagonists spend most of their time devising grisly ways for avoid to die like in the original picture based on a novel by Paul Gallico.The movie isn't bad but the events were also spectacularly filmed in classic version, previously winner several Oscar Academy Award.Introductory sequences are a little boring but one soon gets caught in the tale when the vessel is capsized by tidal wave.The explosions, pyrotechnics and floods are sensational but the movie is just another habitual blockbuster product and resulted to be a box office flop, in spite of a million dollars production. Furthermore, displays a sensational soundtrack by Klaus Badelt and enjoyable cinematography by John Seale.The picture is professionally directed by Wolfgang Petersen. It's a rehash of the previous disaster movies and fairly watchable story.",Poseidon
10,BA_Harrison,Not a total disaster.,6,16 June 2007,"Watch carefully... immediately after the luxury liner Poseidon has been hit by a huge tidal wave and capsized, an inflated life-raft can be seen inexplicably floating by the upturned vessel. Surely the makers of this slick big-budget disaster flick won't bring this conveniently into play at the end of the film, will they? Well, yes, they do. And this is the problem with Poseidon: throughout the film, the audience is expected to accept far too much without question.When the survivors of the accident, on their way to the surface, face a flooded compartment, they swim underwater aimlessly until they happen upon a pocket of air. Convenient, huh?When they are trapped in a rapidly flooding air conditioning shaft and need to undo some screws in order to escape drowning, a necklace makes a handy screwdriver. How fortunate is that?When the only escape route is totally flooded, the ship shifts and the passageway becomes clear. What a stroke of luck!Now don't get me wrong; I didn't hate Poseidon. In fact, I actually enjoyed Wolfgang Pieterson's update of the 70s classic quite a bit. I just had to completely suspend my belief for an hour and a half in order to do so. Sure, the film is cheesy, full of one-dimensional characters, has a flawed script, and lacks a soul, but it is spectacular, has more than its fair share of white-knuckle moments, and features some superb visual effects.Let's face it, this remake was never going to outdo the original (and did anyone really think it would?), which benefited from REAL star power and a decent script. But as far as dumb popcorn adventures go, Poseidon is worth a watchif only for the amazing moment when the wave strikes the ship and all hell breaks loose.",Poseidon
11,paul_haakonsen,Capsized at sea...,7,12 June 2018,"Normally, I am not overly keen on the abundance of re-makes that seem to be spewed out of Hollywood in the past many years.However, this re-make was actually one of the better re-makes to make it out of Hollywood. ""Poseidon"" has great special effects, which really help to bring the movie to life on the screen. And the movie started out in a great speed almost from the very beginning. It has a rather intense storyline, which keeps going at a good pace throughout the entire movie. There is a good pace to the storyline and it doesn't become dull or boring at any time.It had a good cast ensemble, with lots of familiar faces. Some people had small roles and were hardly utilized enough, and that was a shame.This 2006 re-make did, however, suffer from having a rather predictable script and storyline. So there were little twists and surprises along the way. But still, it was quite an entertaining movie.",Poseidon
12,blanche-2,Tragic use of big bucks to make a big ripoff,5,21 July 2006,"98 minutes of fake-looking special effects and sheer dreck comprise ""Poseidon,"" a 2006 movie hoping for people trying to get in out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theater.It was commented by an observant viewer on the board for ""San Francisco"" that Hollywood has lost the art of the buildup, the point being that the big earthquake in ""San Francisco"" didn't occur until the last portion of the film. The film spent its time building up the characters and situations, all heading toward that fateful day. Ditto ""In Old Chicago."" Nowadays, when writers attempt to build a story, it's usually written in too slow a fashion. A great example of a film where this WASN'T the case was ""Match Point,"" written by the brilliant Woody Allen - but you'll have to really look to find another film like that. Producers won't even consider a script that doesn't get to the point in the first 10 minutes.In ""Poseidon,"" Hollywood has reached a new low - and who knew it could sink any lower? We have stock characters given one or two lines to explain their characters. I'm not sure why any of them bothered. There was absolutely no way to care about them. Why not just start with the ship sinking? This was a movie about special effects, nothing more. Why pretend otherwise.Some of the special effects were quite exciting on the big screen, so I gave it a 5. I can't comment on the performances. There weren't any. P.S. I was told - and I don't know if this is true - that if a ship the size of the Poseidon sinks, and you're anywhere near it on a lifeboat, the undertow drags you down with it. Not that anyone was going for accuracy here.",Poseidon
13,Quinoa1984,"it's action and 'what's coming round the bend' entertainment, nothing more or less",6,30 May 2006,"Poseidon is based on a novel, technically, although most will associate it with the original film The Poseidon Adventure from 1972, unseen by me. What I do know whenever someone mentions it is that Shelley Winters is very memorable in it (and actually when they refer to her career they bring up that film or Lolita). But I knew basically that this was your standard Hollywood-sized blockbuster with a man who could either hit just well enough or miss (Wolfgang Peterson). What he provides by way of being director serves this material more than the lackluster Troy from two years ago. Here he's in his element doing something very elemental, however a lot of the time abandoning logic like the several passengers from the ship. It's popcorn entertainment on a scale that I enjoyed for what it was, while noticing that the investment in the characters was only up to a very small point. Then again, I'm not seeing this film for character development, and the screenwriter Mark Protosevich knows this so he just gives unpretentiously what's needed- the main cast who are all just 'types' (i.e. Russell is ex fireman turned mayor, Dreyfuss an architect, Josh Lucas a natural leader, and various female roles of equal strength and shame).While I can't completely recommend the film like I would other more successful big-budget 'disaster' films, I can recommend it perhaps more than others, and unlike the other three big films from this month it doesn't necessarily kid itself too much or go for a way too muddled storyline. And it is actually best to see the film on an IMAX screen (its effectiveness may actually be lost somewhat once its on TV), where the actual first turning point of the ship getting tossed over by the 'rare' wave is almost worth the price of admission alone for its visual prowess and, indeed, excitement. The rest of the picture is just a series of cliffhangers (some more literally than others), and a lot of running, swimming, (some) drowning, and heavy-handed dialog when need be. Peterson is also smart enough here, unlike with Troy, not to overstay the welcome with the material. It's compact enough to be enough of a vehicle of danger and with the technical side all intact, while the characters only get testy up to a point. Some of the early scenes are, of course, too predictable (even if Dreyfuss's romantic side seems a little displaced and unnecessary), as one just wants things go forward with the action. Luckily, on that end, in the tradition of bubble-headed (pun intended) thrillers with all the elements of a matinée serial, it's not bad.",Poseidon
14,Coventry,"Oh no, ""Das Boot"" is upside down!",4,10 July 2018,"Director Wolfgang Petersen must have a fascination for watery disaster flicks. In his native country Germany, he debuted in 1981 with the phenomenal classic ""Das Boot"" and a mere 20 years later he made the solid and intense ""The Perfect Storm"", with George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg. Something must have gone wrong after that, because he also considered it a good idea to remake the 1972 disaster movie classic ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Bad career move, and apparently Petersen still hasn't recovered from this misfire, because he hasn't made another film since. I'm a giant fan of disaster movies from the 70s, notably the Irwin Allen productions, because they were such mastodons with stellar ensemble casts, gigantic and meticulous set designs and old-fashioned but hyper-expensive special effects. The original, directed by Ronald Neame, is a prime example of seventies' disaster extravaganza. I usually don't watch disaster movies that were made after 2000, because I hate computer engineered decors and effects, and for some reason the scripts always contain a lot more redundant melodramatic sub plots than necessary. I also wished I skipped ""Poseidon"" for the exact same reasons, by the way. The basic plot remains unchanged; - shortly after midnight on the 1st of January, the giant luxury cruiser SS Poseidon capsizes due to an enormous tidal wave. Most of the passengers and crew are trapped in the ballroom/restaurant on the deck, but only a select group is intelligent enough to understand they need to head towards the bottom of the ship since it lies upside down. Their plan works, but the chances of survival are quite slim, as the climb is long and goes via narrow ventilation shafts and watery death traps. I tried not to get annoyed by the computer animation, because I knew that from beforehand, but there were various other awful aspects to get upset about. The script contains so many dumb errors; I almost couldn't believe my eyes! For example, near the end, a mother suddenly loses her 9-year-old for no apparent reason. One moment they are all together, and the next he's stuck in a slowly flooding cage while the rest sees an opportunity to escape. What happened, he just decided to go for a little walk all by himself? All the lead and supportive characters are implausible and deeply unlikable. That was also the case in the original, but at least they were charismatic. There aren't any performances here like the ones given by Gene Hackman, Shelley Winters or Ernest Borgnine in 1972. Instead we're stuck with a washed-up Kurt Russell, an uninterested Richard Dreyfuss and a pitiable Kevin Dillon whose 'Lucky Larry' character is a complete travesty.",Poseidon

Another tale of Poseidon capsizing.

It stars Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss together with Emmy Rossum,Jacinda Barrett,Mike Vogel,Mía Maestro,Jimmy Bennett and Andre Braugher. It was directed by Wolfgang Petersen,who is known for great special effects film like A Perfect Storm.Set adrift in the vast waters of the North Atlantic for a luxury New Year's Eve party staged in the ship's magnificent ballroom, the massive ocean-liner Poseidon receives an unexpected jolt when a rogue, 100-foot wave rolls it completely upside down, forcing the surviving passengers to fight their way to safety. Trapped beneath the waterline and implored by the captain to remain in place until a rescue team arrives, the panicked survivors struggle to keep their cool as the water begins to rush in, infernos blaze all around, and a loss of electricity plunges the doomed vessel into total darkness. Seasoned gambler Dylan Johns isn't willing to wage his life on the prompt arrival of help, though, and as he attempts to navigate the treacherous, inverted maze of death, he is flanked by desperate band of like-minded seafarers including eight-year-old Conor and his mother, Maggie, reticent stowaway Elena, suicidal Richard, and concerned father Robert, whose missing daughter may still be somewhere on board along with her frightened fiancé. With a little luck and a little help from on board waiter Marco, the desperate team may just live to see the morning after.The film was a remake that was able to update its special effects at present time but not the cheesiness of the script and the story. the original had the distinct flavor of 1970s but Petersen's movie has loads of CGI but forgot to make the characters interesting and capture the viewers sympathy as it tries to make everything fall into the clichés of Hollywood that present viewers may not enjoy.

As it is, this is hardly a terrible movie, it lacks character development, the plot is stripped bare without any additional depth, and ultimately it's the CGI effects (that do work handsomely enough and were Oscar nominated) that carries the picture to just above average status.Hardly a must see disaster film but enough excitement and suspense to make it a decent time waster for fans of the genre. 6/10",Poseidon
19,Scarecrow-88,Poseidon,5,3 March 2007,"The cruise ship Poseidon is hit by a nasty rogue tidal wave which capsizes it. While many perish in the turning of the ship, there are a few designated characters, arranged properly by the screenplay since we are introduced to each just before the wave hits, who head for the top(bottom; propellers offer an exit if they are cut off) while others, who stay at Captain Bradford's(Andre Braugher)request, are sealed off by bulkhead doors. We automatically know who made the right decision but I never could understand why so many didn't follow suit instead of trusting the unknowable..especially with the idea of being sealed off by steel doors. Anyway we automatically know who the two heroes are at the beginning, because we've seen so many of these Hollywood adventure/disaster flicks it isn't that hard to realize.Kurt Russel portrays the former mayor of New York and firefighter(how appropriate, eh?)whose daughter Emmy Rossum is secretly engaged to Mike Vogel. Richard Dreyfuss portrays a homosexual deeply wounded by a lover's recent betrayal. Jacinda Barrett is a mother whose son Jimmy Bennett is in constant peril. You have Josh Lucas, a card shark who takes money from chosen victims at cruise-ship poker tables, but is a commanding leader who understands any ship pretty well because of pretty much living on them for some time. Mía Maestro is a woman who snuck on the ship and plans to join her young brother in the States. This motley band of characters will strive, through constant danger such as fallen debris and blasts of water, to make it to the destination of the propellers, but often, as is expected in disaster/survivalist films, they will face many set-backs.The tidal wave slamming into the Poseidon is the film's major impact. It succeeds as Cameron's TITANIC did at make your jaw drop, but that is the film's main high-light. Russell and Lucas do what they can with their limited characters. Dreyfuss has seen better days and is given little to do but survive. The chicks of the picture, Rossum, Barrett & Maestro come off better because they are given a bit more to work with..but even they are saddled with basic melodramatic clichés that have been drilled to the audience in these types of film for ages. The film simply dispenses with the usual 30 minutes of building up story so that we can get to know them a bit, leaving us mainly with snippets of dialogue as entrances into their lives at the moment they begin their fateful voyage. Other than the disaster and survival elements in the story, there just isn't much to the film. It really doesn't add anything really fresh to the genre and, sadly, is rather forgettable.

They're all stock characters--the handsome, muscular hero (Josh Lucas); the older hero (Kurt Russell); his headstrong daughter (Emmy Rossum); her bland boyfriend (Mike Vogel); Latina stowaway (Mia Maesno); Latino waiter (Eddie Rodriguez); single mother (Jacinda Barrett) with an annoying son (Jimmy Bennett) and depressed gay guy (Richard Dreyfuss).The ""character"" sequences are laugh out loud funny--thankfully they are brief and there are few of them. The boat being capsized happens VERY early on and the rest is all narrow escapes, countless explosions, lots of screaming and a needlessly loud soundtrack. The special effects are just superb--very believable and realistic. Still there's nobody to care for. There characters are all predictable and the actors really try to bring something to their parts--but can't. Lucas and Rossum come closest to succeeding. Also, despite all the noise, this movie does have its dull spots.MAJOR SPOILER!!!! Maybe it's just me--but is anyone else worried about the only two ethnic characters (Rodriguez and Maestro) being killed? Rodriguez' death is especially horrifying. Maybe I'm seeing too much into this but it bothered me. SPOILER END!!!! So--pretty good. A turn off your brain to enjoy movie. I give it a 7.",Poseidon

22,CinemaSerf,I had a sinking feeling about this...,5,30 November 2020,"Now some things really are best left alone - and a remake of the ""Poseidon Adventure"" (1972) is one of them. Just because you stick a diamanté earring onto Richard Dreyfuss and put Kurt Russell into a suit does not mean that you can recapture the drama created by Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters back in the day. Make no mistake, this doesn't! The visual effects are state of the art (or ought that to be ark?) but there is precisely no sense of peril throughout the entire film as the motley collection try to get to the hull, and safety from their recently capsized ocean liner. Josh Lucas is in his best action eye-candy mode, as is Emily Rossum but the dialogue, pace and whole style of the film relies far to heavily on the CGI and not through on anything more tangible. There are puns a-plenty to pick about this being shallow, having a fishy plot that really does plumb the depths of disaster thrillers - and they'd all be true.

25,view_and_review,Pathetic Predictable Poseidon Plummetts,2,17 January 2007,"I'll say this: if you like action/adventure movies that are entirely cliché, then you will love this movie. ""Poseidon"" is about as original as P. Diddy. The movie is about a capsized ship in which a small band of individuals decide to escape against the orders of the captain. The captain had faith that all would survive so long as they stayed inside the ballroom area and sealed the doors because they would be in an air bubble. The small band of people didn't agree with the captain so they began their journey upward and out of the ship. The small band was right, the captain was wrong, and anyone could have seen that coming.And so the clichés began. From that point on it was a matter of following around these ""brave"" and ""heroic"" troopers as they bumbled through the ship and cleared one insurmountable obstacle after the other (any one of which would have stopped and or killed the average person). Along with following this group, whom we are supposed to be praying for their survival, was guessing who would live and who would die (again very predictable). If you've seen ""Titanic"", ""The Core"", ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Backdraft"", and a host of other action/adventure movies, then you've seen this one as well. They tried to make it more compelling by having a love triangle (daughter, boyfriend, father), and a mother/son relationship, as though you would be more anxious for their survival due to the bond between them. Expect your typical heroism, innumerable close calls, and all the right tools when the situation calls for it. Pre-dic-ta-ble.",Poseidon

Mark Prostosevich's screenplay  based on Paul Gallico's novel  serves up the basic meat- and-potatoes action histrionics with just the right level of straightforward melodrama and formulaic pinches the cast find themselves in the watery graves-to-be as they rise to the challenges of performing heroic feats and bonding to remain alive largely thanks to the assured direction of filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen (no stranger to the sea in his oeuvre) and a steely turn by anti-hero Lucas, a renegade gambler and former fireman/mayor of New York (!)

At least one person dies while saving or sacrificing him / herself. And there will be an annoying kid who hides and nearly causes others to drown in their search. This film should sink down a toilet since it was about as fun as diarrhea. Director Wolfgang Peterson delivers on production but only seldom does he deliver a film of artistic context.

The cast includes Josh Lucas who will act as hero. Kurt Russell who will pay the price for risking his ass. Richard Dreyfuss who hopefully reflects upon a much better lost at sea film he was in called Jaws. Emmy Rossum plays a potential love interest and nothing more.

As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other....So another year and another remake, but this was doomed from the word go, as it stars Josh 'whenever I'm in a blockbuster it flops' Lucas. I think he's a good actor, and some of his more independent films are great, but this, Stealth, and on any levels Hulk, we're failures, and he was one of the big stars of those films.This has all the elements of the original, the old rag tag team who survive have all their own problems, and they come to terms with them throughout the film.Dreyfuss and Russell are the main draw here, and they are great in their roles, Lucas is good, but next to stars of this calibre, he just fades into the background.The effects are the best thing about the whole movie, and once we get to the end of the adventure, you realise that the version with Hackman is still one of the best disaster movies ever made.So in the end, it's not as bad as many state on here, it's just pointless.",Poseidon

Great performances, a riveting story, the fact that you never really knew who was going to survive, good characterization. -In this lousy remake you get lame cardboard cutouts who might as well have 'casualty', 'sacrifice', and 'safe' on their respective foreheads.

The effects, as expected, were better (not by leaps and bounds, but they were a bit better) and this one moved at a much faster clip so that was a positive as well. Still, not much in the way of development either as one minute we our introduced to the characters, and the next a giant tidal wave is about to crash into the ship. Our survivors quickly say, ""lets go up"". Well the ones that form the core group of survivors do and they head on out. The first one was a bit more realistic in this area as well...and of course during their trip toward the bottom now the top of the ship our group of survivors meet obstacle after obstacle as they make their way and they of course have their numbers reduced.

Probably the temptation of the state of the art CGI effects positioned Peterson into 'recreating' the 1972 thriller, but sadly the result is a heavy mess of special effects with little attention paid to the characters who should be 'driving the boat' into a story.After a scant few poorly written minutes that introduce the passengers and crew who are to provide the emotional interest in the story (Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Freddy Rodríguez, Andre Braugher, Kevin Dillon, Jacinda Barrett, Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel, Mía Maestro, etc - stereotypes all), up comes the 'rogue wave' and the ships turns upside down leaving the remainder of the film focused on how to get out of the trapped bubble. For about fifteen minutes it works then all becomes redundant and the ending matches the desire of the tired audience - the sinking.Why with so many fine stories to tell and new concepts to explore Hollywood continues to exhume old movies to remake is a puzzle.

34,SimonJack,This remake falls far short of the original,6,22 November 2018,"""Poseidon"" is a remake of the 1972 film, ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" that was based on a 1969 novel of the same title by Paul Gallico. And, while this film had a huge budget of more than $160 million and set records for CGI creations, it was a box office flop. It grossed just under $182 million, but it needed to have double that in box office receipts just to break even for the Warner Brothers share.So, this joins the ranks of the large majority of movie remakes that don't succeed. Why does Hollywood keep trying to repeat the same films, one might ask? Well, money is the motive, of course. And most of the time, the original films were smash hits. So, a studio will play the odds with a remake, especially if it has a promising screenplay and can get a top cast.This is a classic example. The 1972 original film had a budget of $4.7 million but grossed $93.3 million at the box office. It was a smashing success and the biggest moneymaking film that year. In 2018 dollars, that budget would be $28 million, and the box office would be $550 million.So, why did this 2006 film flop? Mainly because the screenplay was far inferior. Secondly, while it had a few known names in the cast, none of the cast gave exceptional performances for roles that weren't nearly as interesting. In contrast, the 1972 film was loaded with well-known names and established actors. And all of them were superb in very interesting roles.The story here has a significant change in the ending. And, for all the CGI, much more was put into the destruction and mayhem than in the characters who were enduring it. One thing that struck me as very far-fetched was toward the end of the film as the small group came to an open area that was several stories high. It looked to be 60 to 80 feet. What ship would have such a high chamber in its bottom?The movie did have tremendous visual effects.

36,JamesHitchcock,"Lacks the epic scale of ""Titanic"" and the human touch of ""The Perfect Storm""",5,29 August 2009,"The disaster film, that quintessentially seventies genre, suffered a decline in the eighties, but has made something of a comeback in recent years, doubtless helped by the immense success of ""Titanic"" in 1997. ""Poseidon"" is a remake of that other sinking ship film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"", one of the original crop of disaster movies from the early seventies. It was directed by Wolfgang Petersen who had earlier made another film about a disaster at sea, ""The Perfect Storm"".On New Years Eve the luxury ocean liner Poseidon, named after the Greek sea god, is on a Transatlantic crossing when it is overturned by a sudden rogue wave. The film follows the efforts of a miscellaneous group of characters who have survived the initial impact to escape from the stricken ship as they make their way upwards towards the now upturned hull. They include Dylan Johns, a former sailor turned professional gambler, Robert Ramsey, a former Mayor of New York, his daughter Jennifer and her boyfriend, a gay architect who is suicidal after splitting up with his partner, another professional gambler named Lucky Larry, an attractive single mother and her young son and a stowaway desperate to get to New York to be with her sick brother. (We learn that before becoming mayor, Ramsey worked as a fireman. This detail may have been included as a tribute to the heroic firefighters of 9/11, but it did make me wonder when the last time was, in real life, that a blue-collar worker was elected Mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg is not only his city's mayor, but also its richest citizen, and his three predecessors were all lawyers).Many disaster films have a distinctive two-act structure. (""Titanic"", ""The Perfect Storm"", ""Dante's Peak"", ""The Towering Inferno"" and the original 1972 ""Poseidon Adventure"" are all examples). Act I sets the human background to the disaster by giving us a select group of characters with whom we can identify. Act II deals with the disaster itself, the main source of drama being whether or not the select group will be able to escape with their lives. ""Poseidon"" follows this structure, but at only 98 minutes it is notably shorter than most disaster movies, including the 1972 film which was about twenty minutes longer. In this case the disaster strikes early on in the film, which means that Act I is very much shorter than Act II. It is something of a convention in disaster films that the catastrophe should be caused or exacerbated by human greed or complacency, but the remake omits the subplot from the original movie in which the shipping company, against the Captain's advice, insist that the ship sail full steam ahead without taking on the extra ballast which could have provided greater stability.There is a reason why most disaster films are longer than this one. The two-act structure takes time to develop, and when the first act is as rushed as it is here the result can be a motley collection of cardboard cut-outs with little individual personality whom an audience will find it difficult to care about. Probably the best among them was Richard Dreyfuss's architect, but few of the others stood out. Josh Lucas's Dylan is supposed to be one of the heroes of the film, but he comes across as so cocky and arrogant that it is hard to care what happens to him. Kurt Russell (Ramsey) has given much better performances than this one, and the three female leads Jennifer, Maggie (single mum) and Elena (stowaway) are interchangeable in personality and virtually so in looks. Emmy Rossum looked set for a highly successful film career after ""Phantom of the Opera"", but this does not seem to have materialised so far.The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Visual Effects, and the special effects are certainly competently done, especially the initial scenes of the disaster and the scene where the sea breaks through into the ballroom. Special effects, however, are not enough in themselves to make a film a success, and although the action scenes generate some tension, an awful lot of time seems to be taken up with people running around in the dark screaming with occasional flashes of light illuminating the scene. This is far from being the worst disaster film I have seen (that dubious honour must go to ""The Cassandra Crossing""), but it is also far from being the best. It is many years since I last saw the original ""Poseidon Adventure"", so I will not attempt a direct comparison, but I will say that ""Poseidon"" lacks the epic scale and grandeur of ""Titanic"" and the human touch that distinguishes films such as ""Towering Inferno"" and Petersen's earlier ""Perfect Storm"". 5/10",Poseidon
37,StevePulaski,A video game lacking the privilege to play it,6,9 June 2013,"Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon is just about what'd you expect from a remake of the 1972 adventure classic. It features thin characters, some enthralling sequences, lots of screaming, and lots of water. It also holds the record for most computer-generated objects, featuring 181,579 individual objects, including 382 cabins, 876 portholes, 73 towels, and 681 deck chairs. It's good to know not much was waterlogged in the making of this film.We immediately begin on the Poseidon cruise-ship, which is cruelly met with a rogue wave, leading the massive ship to capsize. After the blast is over, with many injured, many dead, debris everywhere, and countless missing, the captain urges everyone to stay in the ballroom area, which will be sealed off, allegedly creating a vacuum. Several passengers, Dylan (Josh Lucas) Robert (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), Richard (Richard Dreyfuss), Connor (Jimmy Bennett), Maggie (Jacinda Barrett), Elena (Mía Maestro), her son Carter, and Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez), find the captain's reasoning facile and follow the confident Dylan, who strongly believes he can get the gang off of the ship.They dodge sporadic flash-fires caused by gas leaks and random explosions, extremely crowded areas thanks to fallen debris, and about every obstacle one could imagine on a cruise-ship victim to a harsh wave. The film isn't hard to foresee and the viewer constantly remains one or two steps ahead of it at all times. But that doesn't mean the film isn't competent and enjoyable on a basic level. Okay, a very basic level. There's some level of excitement and anxiety that comes with watching a group of people struggle to survive on a seemingly-doomed ship. It almost works as a claustrophobic film, where part of the success of the film lies in the hands of the viewer to put themselves in the lead characters' position in the film.Speaking of claustrophobia, there is a master-sequence in Poseidon, which justifies my higher-than-expected rating. The scene involves the large group of people crawling through a cramped air-vent, with water rising from the bottom into the ventilation-shaft. The end of the shaft is, of course, sealed off by the vent itself, which needs to be unbolted. This particular scene lasts about seven to eight minutes, with rising water levels coming dangerously close to drowning two of the passengers. It's a frightening sequence, captured beautifully under Petersen's tense and narrow (in location not depth) direction.Moreover, Petersen's credentials make him more than capable to direct an underwater excursion. He manned the camera in the submarine classic Das Boot, and also in the underrated Perfect Storm, a sea-savvy adventure about a ship's crew caught up in a combined storm, facing breakneck wave after wave. There was a film that, by the end, left a viewer exhausted and breathless from the astronomical amount of waves thrown at them. Here, in Poseidon's case, we get one wave, whose damage is shown pretty explicitly, and while it is satisfying in the way it's portrayed, the after-stuff is pretty mundane and relentless.It would be correct to call Poseidon a bit too much of a muchness. It would, however, be too harsh to call it a waste of time. The film's adventurous and uncompromisingly suspenseful tone are a plus, as well as some of its setups. But each time the characters were faced with a new obstacle, I felt the whole thing was too much like a video game. Think about it: the group rebels against order, they head upstairs (really downstairs) to try and evacuate the ship, they go from room-to-room, usually barricaded by something or almost forced to solve a cryptic puzzle in order to maneuver and venture on, and you're met with something of satisfaction at the end before the credits role. Game over, here's your achievement.Starring: Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mía Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Kevin Dillon, Andre Braugher, Freddy Rodriguez, and Fergie.

It's a good thing I rented this for free while working at a game company or else I would have been really ticked off. The film had a decent cast but they really didn't have anything to work with and some of the most Hollywood sort of dialogue imaginable, especially when the designer of the ship says something along the lines of ""This ship isn't designed to stay afloat upside down"" when the ship flips over cause of a huge wave. And the survivors got pretty annoying especially Kurt Russell's daughter's boyfriend, Josh Lucas was okay, he sort of reminded me of a younger version of Daniel Craig. Just about everything about this film was generic, the only sort of intense scene in the movie was the elevator scene. It's another one of those films that is easily forgettable and I can't believe this piece of mess had a budget of $160 million dollars, cause the special effects are good but not very impressive, even the crashing of the ballroom scene. I heard that Gerard Butler auditioned for a role in this movie, thank God he didn't get it and ended up playing Leonidas in ""300"". Just about nothing in this film was exciting or intense and just cheesy. There is just absolutely no set up what so ever and the characters aren't even close to being developed enough for the audience to care. It's just happy new years and a tidal wave hits, and that is all you basically need to know from the beginning of the film and there isn't even a build up and no emotional impact.

42,sddavis63,A Very Ordinary Effort,5,22 September 2007,"It's been a good number of years since I've watched ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" from which this remake was born, but I remember feeling that while the original was good, it didn't blow me away. Like most remakes, this one didn't quite live up to the original, and the best I would say is that it wasn't bad, but somehow it also just didn't manage to take hold of me. I watched it, but I wasn't grabbed by it. In some respects the story seemed too much like the original, which I've already seen, and many of the things that were different didn't work for me.Take Richard Dreyfuss, for instance. He's a fine actor, in this movie playing passenger Richard Nelson. Nelson is essentially this movie's equivalent of Red Buttons' character in the original, and yet I just didn't find myself caring that much for him or about him. Buttons was to me one of the highlights of the original, but Dreyfuss seemed largely out of place somehow, and never really captured the essence of the part. In fact, the only actor who really impressed me (and somewhat to my surprise since I'm not a particular fan of his) was Kurt Russell, as the lead character Robert Ramsey. Russell seemed right in this part; everyone else seemed a little bit lost. The movie also had far too many happy coincidences to allow the group to escape the ship; it never really seemed at any point as though all might be lost.However, I said this wasn't bad, and it wasn't. One of the better decisions in this movie was to remember that it's an action movie. It avoided the trap of interminable character development, and instead moved quickly into the actual disaster - the rogue wave hits the ship pretty early on in the movie, within the first 20 minutes I would say. For the most part, we learn about the characters after they're facing the crisis. As I said, the writers clearly remembered that this was an action movie, and they included plenty of action, along with a lot of very impressive special effects. Who the survivors would turn out to be was also a bit of a mystery right up to the end. Some of those I thought would make it didn't and the same was true in reverse. This unpredictability added a bit of suspense.Permit me a couple of more specific observations. I had trouble with Andre Braugher, in the role of the Captain. First of all, it took me a while to realize that he was the captain. He seemed more like part of the on-board entertainment at first. Then, it was difficult for me to believe that the ship's captain wouldn't realize that the ship couldn't hold up under the water pressure once it was capsized, and yet the captain looked positively shocked as the windows and seals started to crack and water began to seep in. That leads me to one of the more memorable lines in the movie (who knows why I found it memorable; it was hardly the most dramatic one, I admit, and yet it stuck with me for some reason) when Dreyfuss looks at Maggie (Jacinda Barrett) and convinces her to come with the group by pointing out the captain's obviously faulty knowledge of his own ship: ""I'm an architect. The ship isn't made to float upside down."" That reminded me a bit of Victor Garber (playing Mr. Andrews in ""Titanic,"") when he says to Rose ""the ship's made of iron. I assure you - it can sink!"" I have very mixed feelings about this one. I watched it right through without being tempted to leave it but I don't think I'd watch it again and I wasn't ever at the edge of my seat. A middling effort at best, which earns a 5/10.",Poseidon
43,Robert_duder,I hate agreeing with anyone but Poseidon more than capsizes,5,14 May 2006,"I don't really know if I had high expectations for Poseidon. I mean I know it was expected to be one of the big summer blockbusters and I have seen more the incomparable and incredible original The Poseidon Adventure (see my review) and the horrific disaster that was the TV remake with Steve Guttenberg (see my review.) So I headed out to watch the latest incarnation. Secretly I think I hoped for a 9/10 maybe even a kick ass perfect score with big special effects, and terrifying moments. Instead Poseidon turns out to be a complete and total camp-fest with little to no character development, unintentionally hilarious scenes, rather overblown CGI special effects, and a poorly developed story. So all that being said why am I giving it a 7/10?? Well it's not unredeemable, it has it's moments. Despite the pitiful script Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, even Richard Dreyfuss are watchable. There are some genuine moments of edge of your seat thrills and overall it's not a complete waste of time...despite being the campiest big budget film I've ever seen.Josh Lucas headlines the cast as professional gambler Dylan Johns. There is barely anything to say about anyone's character or performance because there is soooo little character development. It almost doesn't matter who they are or how they behave. However Lucas is a nice looking guy and manages to pull off being the head of the cast pretty good. Just unfortunate the script didn't give him more. Kurt Russell is second runner up in the cast as former Mayor of New York, and firefighter Robert Ramsey. I didn't even know his characters name until I looked it up on IMDb. I love Russell, always have, he's done some great films and I was excited to see him in this one in the ""Gene Hackman-type"" character from the original. He does alright but same deal as Lucas...no character development, you just don't care and one of the most unintentionally HILARIOUS death scenes where supposedly he saves everyone. Richard Dreyfuss plays gay (which has NOTHING to do with the film...and in true Hollywood style is represented because he wears an ear ring) dumped and suicidal rich guy Richard Nelson. It's been awhile since I've seen Dreyfuss on screen, he's old...and with a script instead of a hodge podge of crap he could have been a good character. Emmy Rossum plays Kurt Russell's daughter, and she literally must have gotten this film for eye candy only. Her cleavage should have been credited separate from her there was so many shots of her crawling around and the camera aiming at ""the Twins"" as she refers to them at one point. Even Kurt Russell begs her to put them away. The rest of the cast including young star Jimmy Bennett, Mike Vogel, Jacinda Barrett, Andre Braugher, and Mía Maestro are all non existent characters. Again I don't believe for one second that ANY of them are to blame, instead it's just one of the worst scripts for a big budget production ever. And finally I must mention the most useless, annoying addition of any character probably in the history of film making Kevin Dillon as Lucky Larry. He's brash and annoying and just completely useless and thank GOODNESS dies within a few minutes.I am shattered and confused as to how INCREDIBLE action director Wolfgang Petersen didn't fix this film right up. Maybe they wanted it to be campy and nothing but million dollar explosions everywhere...I don't know but it's certainly not Petersen worthy. The film has SOOO many plot holes and errors and I could go on for DAYS!! You literally leave the film asking yourself 20 different...How could that...wait a minute what?? Why?? How on earth did they....?? It just goes on and on. So how can I bad mouth a film so badly and still say that's not a complete loss?? Well the special effects are big, and there are some moments of terror that will have your jaw dropping, and the stars are good enough that they are worth watching and with a budget of this size it's at least nice to watch. Some people might even say it was good!!! Not me...not after seeing the original. And despite what people are saying this IS a remake. Sure none of the characters names are the same but some moments are similar, and the story is there and although they changed a little here and there it's still a remake at the core. They rush through what should have been the depthy important parts of the story, completely lost all character development and left plot holes abound but if you wanna some mindless big money explosions than you might think this one is okay. 5/10",Poseidon

All is going (FTP) swimmingly, until the ship is suddenly hit by a gigantic tidal wave that causes a lot of death and destruction and topples the boat over. A few survivors must fight their way out if they want to come out alive.I wish they'd remake more modern films. This remake of 1972 disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure has come over thirty years after that film. Needless to say, it's a film I haven't seen and, owing to age, as a disaster movie probably wouldn't be too impressed with now. This isn't the first time director Wolfgang Petersen has dallied with disasters at sea movies. I never saw his highly acclaimed Das Boot either, but I think I hit the nail on the head when I say this makes his average 2000 disaster flick The Perfect Storm seem like a much better film.The film's only real high-point is it's special effects. They're very similar to those of Titanic...ah, yes, it reminds me of that very over-rated film in a lot of ways. But character development is thrown (here comes a bad pun again) overboard very quickly and we end up with cardboard characters we care next to nothing about, left to go through the motions trotting out some truly banal dialogue that does nothing to (oh, Lord have mercy) keep the film afloat.If you like a nice, special effects filled film, then Poseidon will definitely float your boat. If your care for anything more meaningful, it will likely sink without trace from your memory very fast. **",Poseidon
45,MOscarbradley,"Big, dumb and brainless it may be but this is genuine entertainment",7,2 July 2006,"You know exactly where you are with ""Posiedon"" from the opening shot as the camera glides and swoops over the eponymous great ship and one look at the cast of has-beens and never-was'-in-the-first-place tells you that the ship is the star. Of course, anyone familiar with the original ""The Posiedon Adventure"" knows that about 20 minutes in the ship will end up topsy-turvey with about 99.9% of the cast floating at the top which is now the bottom. The few that survive are, of course, the same sundry bunch of clichés from a hundred disaster movies; the bad boy gambler who is going to make good, the ex-Mayor of New York with the recalcitrant daughter and the boyfriend daddy disapproves of, the single mother with the cute kid and so on. The first 'Posiedon' had Shelly Winters' fat, Jewish grandmother; this one has Richard Dreyfuss as an ageing homosexual and all round nice guy. (Actually Winters' character here is really an amalgam of Dreyfuss and Kurt Russell's former fire-fighting ex-Mayor).The fact that the film lacks real 'stars' means that we can never be sure who is going to end up fish food and who is going to make it to the ship's hull. And, of course, nobody acts though Dreyfuss just about makes you believe in his character. So far, so corn-filled. But from the moment the giant wave hits, (and the special effects are state-of-the-art), this 'Posiedon' is one great set piece after another. (The film roughly follows the plot of the original but with enough variations to ensure the thrill quotient remains high).And if the ship itself is the star it is mostly as a hunk of twisted, burning metal and glass and the set direction is superb. So, too, is director Wolfgang Petersen's handling of the virtual non-stop action sequences. And at 99 minutes it never outstays its welcome. In fact, it's just the kind of big, dumb, brainless entertainment that is genuinely entertaining. A pop-corn movie for the masses and a notch or three or four above the original.",Poseidon
46,MLDinTN,enough suspense to keep you interested,6,6 March 2007,"This movie was OK. It relies on CGI effects to make the film rather than actually story which is why it gets only so-so reviews.

There are 2 main heroes, the heroic firefighter/mayor Robert and the young cute Dylan who has the idea to find a way to the outside rather than stay in the ballroom. They are joined by a worker and a mother and son. First they luckily find Robert's daughter, her boyfriend and another girl. They appear to be the only 3 people who survived at the disco along with the annoying Lucky Larry. Who continues to make crassless jokes about the situation as they walk over dead people. Of course, he gets the ending he deserves.The film is kept short and the action is suspenseful in the last third of the film. The whole story has been done so many times. Like the dad giving up his life in the end to save everyone. Can anyone say Bruce Willis in Amagedanon.

48,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Actually quite good, but could have been nastier!",7,13 June 2006,"Poseidon runs a surprisingly brisk 99 minutes, with 10 minutes reserved for credits. It cost Warner $160 million dollars to produce, which means that the film cost $900, 000 for every thirty seconds of footage. Wolfgang Petersen's original cut was 125 minutes before someone, somewhere ordered him to cut it down. Don't get me wrong, it's constantly going and the short running time matches the no-seconds-to-spare realism of a gradually sinking capsized ship. The set pieces the film has to offer are all nail-biting and intense, but I just felt that there wasn't enough of them.I'm not such a big fan of the original. I liked it as a kid but viewing it as an adult I'm turned-off by the soap opera drama and dated effects. Back in the early 70s this may well have been fine but perhaps such advances in movie effects is why remakes of these kind of movies are not so unnecessary. Though I don't really consider this a 'remake' as it is just another version of Paul Gallico's novel.The characters are all likable and even though the set-up and introductions are pretty quick, we get to know enough and grow attached to them before the big wave hits (no longer a tsunami) and what a set-piece that turns out to be! The initial capsizing of the ship is a brilliantly edited destruction derby in which many, many human lives meet violent deaths. If there would be just one thing the film has to offer it is plenty of dead bodies. But why not go one step further and show some really heavy gruesomeness? I would have liked that! The idiots (there are usually loads in disaster films) stay behind in the ballroom while a bunch of more sensible survivors decide to escape by going up (down) to the engine room and out through the propeller tubes. Only because everything is inverted, there are loads of obstacles, including a race-against-time in a very small and very cramped air vent. Not all of them make it! It's a shame that Poseidon didn't do better at the box office but it faced stiff competition in summer 2006. The worldwide grosses maxed out at $181 million, so it only just barely broke even. For some reason Poseidon has had a bad reputation, which is doesn't deserve. A fleshed-out extended version might win over the doubters.",Poseidon

The finale is full of suspense, and the body count is surprisingly a lot harder to predict then expected, plus it's pretty well made and written. The only thing I didn't care for was Russel's character dying, as I wished he would have stayed alive, and I generally detest remakes but this one was actually pretty good, it's just a shame, it bombed at the box office. The action is non stop, so you will never be bored, and there are quite a few shocking moments as well, plus aside from a couple wooden acting jobs namely(Mike Vogel), it was pretty good, plus I got exactly what I expected and that was an exciting blockbuster!.

53,johnnyboyz,Isn't able to tread water well enough to be any good and does come strikingly close to sinking like a stone.,5,28 August 2007,"I find it so ironic that this film is entitled exactly 'Poseidon' and is the remake of a 70s film entitled exactly 'The Poseidon Adventure' because this remake is exactly what it says it is: Poseidon minus the 'adventure'. The set up for this film just sums up exactly what it is and that is: weak. A massive wave named a rogue wave or something to that effect engulfs the ship and bumps it over thus turning the ship from utopian New Years Eve bliss to dystopian New Years Day hell.Poseidon is really just Deep Rising minus the monsters, it's a series of unspectacular and problematical situations that are complicated in the weakest of ways thanks to either a; the threat of rising water or b; the fact a character has a 'beef' with another character or the situation they're faced with  the claustrophobic woman and the air vent problem is the most glaring. After a set up introducing the characters whom we will be watching attempt to get out of this massive cruise liner and an oddly non-thrilling and unspectacular scene when the wave does hit, Poseidon just nestles into a nice rhythm of cause and effect revolving around various situations you might find yourself in when threatened with this scenario.What's only very slightly effective is the fact you don't know who's going to die and who isn't as there's no real clear cut hero apart from the guy who knows his way around the boat but maybe killing that person off when they're half way through the mission thus rendering the expedition momentarily lost would have been a fun and unnerving move. But one problem I did have is that the film struggles with its conflict since you can't have conflict if there is no villain and a villain is exactly what this film lacks. As a result, the situations and events that occur such as the climbing of a vent as the water rises, the attempt to cross the main lobby from up high, the travelling from flood tank to flood tank and the fact someone gets stuck behind a grill are not down to a story with conflict but are merely consequential. Even then I had problems with Poseidon because the first time the characters travel from flood tank to flood tank, it's built up and dramatic but they do it about six times  each time it happens we're meant to believe that it isn't as stressful as it was the first time and of course, despite the fact the boat is upside down each flood tank opens right on cue.Like I said; these events that lead one onto the other do not make for a story, they just make for a series of events that lead onto one another. It's like it doesn't matter what these people's names are or where they're from or anything else  all that matters is the rising water dramatics, the series of life/death situations and the getting of Emmy Rossum in a soaking wet dinner dress. Apart from anything else, I didn't find these events that dramatic and quickly tired of the film. Another thing I couldn't fathom (no pun intended) is the fact the continuity was so deliberately false. This water is or should be freezing cold and despite the characters only wearing very scant attire the whole way through, they never get cold. As well as this; the torches that the boat had on board must be some sort of super brand as despite all the water and the banging about, they never stopped working.It was only really after the film had ended and I thought about it that I came to the conclusion of what a shoddy film it really was and this was only hammered home by the silly ending  as soon as that happened, I just thought: ""Yeah, so what? That's it?"" Make no mistake that when the term 'brainless fun' is applied to a summer blockbuster, it's sometimes done tongue in cheek but this time it's absolutely dead on because this is brainless, plot less and characterless but I suppose it is sort of fun, isn't it? Maybe the first time.",Poseidon

Of course, it is a killing that tries to escape a small group where the heroes are, in what appears to be the most risky of plans: to go out into the open air by the bottom of the ship.Technically, the film is much more evolved than its predecessor. Times are different, the ways to achieve visual and special effects have evolved. It's normal. The film raises a question of CGI and effects, visual and sound, as it happens with the majority of the films of catastrophes.

56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Entertaining popcorn-muncher, but lacks substance",5,6 June 2006,"Having not seen the original 1972 ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" I can merely speculate as to how Wolfgang Petersen's ""Poseidon"" is compared to that film aside from much more visually amazing. With that out of the way, ""Poseidon"" can simply be stated as a modern day, visually enhanced disaster movie, and that's it.The plot is simple: a ship gets hit by a freak rogue wave and tips completely over and a group of the survivors try and make their way to the top before drowning. The talent all pretty much gets wasted here, from Kurt Russel to Richard Dreyfus to young star Emmy Rossum. Josh Lucas is simply cool, and the role, while not very special, fits him nicely. Overall, however, the characters and big names are simply meant to bring you to the theater so you can watch and guess which ones die first. While the suspense in this case certainly does exist, it's nothing that hasn't been seen in the string of late 90's disaster movies.What gives this film the little merit it has are the visuals and well-thought out director's choices from Petersen when it comes to the disaster images. The stunt work and scenery here is intense and highly respectable as I'm aware Josh Lucas injured his ribs on set. One of the most interesting and strongest choices Petersen makes is to show what it would look like in every possible area on a ship when the boat is turning completely over. You see everything from the main party room where most guests are at, to the kitchens, to the deck pools as people fall out of them and the water dumps out of the pool. It really gives off the feel that the main characters are not alone and it makes it a bit scarier for the viewer as well given many people have been on cruise ships.Basically, if you're looking to go to a movie and you've seen everything else this summer, ""Poseidon"" is a worthwhile way to kill 99 minutes and not regret it.",Poseidon
57,Anonymous_Maxine,"""Let me go, Bull!!""",5,22 May 2006,"I think everything in my weekend led up to me watching Poseidon last night. First of all, ever since reading a fascinating novel called Shadow Divers a few weeks ago, I have been devouring every book and documentary and movie about submarines, shipwrecks, U-Boats, ocean liners, and other sea calamities that I could find. One of them, which I got my hands on two days before seeing this movie, was the original Poseidon Adventure (1972), which surprised me in its lack of fundamental knowledge about how ships sink. The last thing I am going to do here is get all technical about the logistics of a sinking ship, I've seen some documentaries and read some books but am hardly an expert. Second of all, by pure coincidence, I went to Universal Studios Hollywood earlier the same day as I saw this movie, where I saw, for the first time, the Backdraft attraction featured there. The relevance comes up later.First a little background the Poseidon was struck by a very real but little known phenomenon called a ""rogue wave,"" which is essentially a mid-ocean, completely unpredictable collision of two massive ocean waves (you would be absolutely astounded to learn how large and fast moving mid-ocean waves can be, by the way), which results in another wave, which you might say is more than the sum of its parts. This resulting wave, if it happens to form near an unlucky ship, say, an ocean liner, can literally be hundreds of feet tall and yes, roll a full-sized ocean liner upside down like a bathtub toy. But here's something curious (which was wrong in both the 1972 version and the 2006 version)  after having been rolled by the wave, the Poseidon is literally hanging on the surface by this pocket of air in which the movie takes place. Thhe plot concerns the efforts of a small group of survivors to get to the top of the ship (now the bottom), and somehow get through the hull to the safety of the open air. Now here's the problem that neither movie realized  as soon as any hole was poked or opened into the hull, that trapped air would shoot outward with phenomenal force (likely shooting any nearby humans through the hole and a good distance into the air).The 1972 version thought that they could just escape through the hole, but the 2006 version thinks that the propellers, which for some reason are still spinning hours after the ship capsized, could somehow shoot air INTO the hole. Yes, the propellers are powerful, and yes, a lot of wind would be created, but none of it would make it into the high pressure area where the characters are, but would rather blow right over the hole like it wasn't even there. On to the characters, because there is nothing to the story. Rogue wave hits ocean liner, a few try to escape, that's the whole story. A steadily shrinking group of white people trudge through hordes of corpses of black and latino people, trying to escape before the ship sinks. At one point, there is a tense moment where you don't know whether a gay man (Richard Dreyfuss) or a Hispanic man are going to be killed. I guessed the gay man, since there was no black character, who would surely have been killed first. It is in this scene that I suppose the current racial and sociological stratification of the Hollywood Movie is illustrated.Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell are our heroes, both of whom are forced to go through the standard disaster movie motions for the unmotivated director, who is a far better director than this movie allows him to demonstrate, as he has so many times before. Kurt Russell is one of those actors that people tend to either love or hate, like John Travolta or Steven Segal, but I have to admit that his presence in this movie is one of the best things about it. There is one scene where he is actually handed the opportunity to blurt, ""It's okay, I used to be a firefighter!"" (""You gowe go!!""). An homage that he is later able to refute (""Kick him loose!""). There's lots of goofy romance and cookie cutter parental conflict (Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum as his daughter, and Mike Vogel as her boyfriend literally play exactly the same roles as Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, and Ben Affleck in Armageddon, right down to the ending. The plot and character similarities are downright alarming). (spoilers) That all being said, the only thing left that I really want to know was what went on in the script reading sessions where, when getting to the end of the script, they read that the remaining characters escape the sinking ship seconds before she slips below the waves, they jump into the water and swim the ten to fifteen feet to the fully inflated, fluorescent orange lifeboat waiting for them (incidentally the one, single thing left floating after the ships sinks), and fired off a flare from the flare gun which came with the miracle life boat, then sat back and grinned gleefully as the first flare they fired morphs into rescue helicopters.

Both versions of the movie have plenty of star power, and the adventure is top notched as well. In ""Poseidon"", everyone is having fun on New Year's Eve, yet some are having the blues. That rogue wave looked awesome from a far away view, but when that wave hits, it's disastrous! I liked it when that had Fergie(Stacy Ferguson) playing Gloria in the movie. The survivors in the movie played it very well when everyone got to plan their escape. Richard Dreyfuss role in this film proves he's got a lot to live for after his lover left him. He was smart enough never to trust the captain(Andre Braugher). He may have tried to calm the passengers, but his trust is very limited. Kinda reminds me of ""When Time Ran Out.."" At least some of the survivors died heroes, like Robert Ramsey(Kurt Russell). His sacrifice gave his daughter and fiancé a chance to escape from the wrecked ship. Whatever someone else says about this movie, it is worth my while. I've enjoyed it very well. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",Poseidon
59,thinker1691,Movie Disaster,3,31 August 2006,"It is with sinking heart, one sees this film with anything but disappointment. Conceptualizing the original, it's difficult not to compare the two. Indeed, when viewing the second, one cannot help but notice their stark differences. In the first, Ernest Borgnine, Gene Hackman, and Red Buttons, led the dazed survivors throughout the unfamiliar landscape interior of the upended ship. Their adventure created a legendary journey in the annals of movie history. Even Shelly Winters is well remembered as heroic. In the remake, we have Kurt Russell as Robert Ramsey, Josh Lucas as Dylan Johns and Richard Dreyfuss as Richard Nelson. If his character had some dark 'secret' to impart, he never exercised it. Despite all their star status, the remake leaves much to be desired. Except for computerized special effects and mechanical stunts, the second is woefully inadequate to replace the original. I would be interested in learning the reasons why Dreyfuss and Russell took their roles as neither enhanced their career by accepting them. Indeed, their feeble performances fell well short of memorable. All in all, a disappointment for both movie fans and film historians. **",Poseidon

A re-telling of a classic disaster hit about a cruise ship called The Poseidon is suddenly turned upside down, by a gigantic wave. But the writers should have written better characters.

62,meeza,Had a Special Effect on me but had Drowning with Boredom Characters,7,21 May 2006,"""Poseidon"" will not turn your world around, but its special ""visual effect"" display will savior your taste, not to mention also the film. The remake of the 70's trendsetting disaster flick ""The Poseidon Adventure"" did not rock my boat enough for me to recommend you to sail on board. Let's start with the dry acting ensemble passengers of the ""Poseidon"": Josh Lucas did not play his acting cards right as the gambler protagonist Dylan Johns, Kurt Russell was programmatically mechanical as a the overprotective father and former Mayor Robert Ramsey, Emmy Rossum will not be getting no Oscar or Emmy for that matter in her role as Ramsey's wearisome daughter Jenny, and Jacinda Barrett needs to get a real acting world life because this former ""MTV Real World Lifer"" was atrocious as the single mother Maggie. There are others who did not survive the acting cut of the ""Poseidon"", but then I think the acting ""shit"" will really hit the fan or no fans for that matter if I continue with the performances negativity. The only lifer of the ""Poseidon"" which swam it course was the magnetic Richard Dreyfuss who plays Richard Nelson, a heartbroken homosexual passenger who intends to commit suicide by jumping of the ship but a ""new wave"" of troubles prevents him from taking that fatal leap. The aforementioned is probably the film's only unforgettable scene. The beauty of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" was its magnificent screenplay of compelling characters and their wittiness to use their persona to aid them in their efforts on escaping death in a reversed sunken ship. Unfortunately, Mark Protosevich's screenplay of ""Poseidon"" was the complete upside-down opposite. The characters of ""Poseidon"" are not developed enough for one to care whether they sink or swim. Director Wolfgang Peterson must have cried like a wolf when he read this dreary screenplay. However, Peterson is a technical wizard and did a credible job in directing the film's catastrophic scenes with the aid of mesmerizing special effects. But then again, he missed the boat by showing too much water action and not enough character substance. Wolfgang should have been on a liquid diet when he was directing the film. ""Poseidon"" will not completely drown you with boredom, due to the lifesavers of the film: Dreyfuss and Visual Effects. *** Average",Poseidon

""Poseidon,"" perhaps embracing this sensibility, storms right out of the gates with its money shot, a flyby tour of the doomed ship's exterior from all angles that might be half as impressive as it sounds. The CG looks like a student reel, amateurish and fake with goofy footage of soon-to-be hero Josh Lucas jogging the upper decks awkwardly crammed in. It's a downhill slide from there as a thin plot yields to the power of impressive post-production effects to bail it out, and the cavalry never manages to arrive. A surprisingly star-studded cast struggles with one dimensional characters, banal ""here's what I'm looking at"" dialog and plot twists so by-the-book I was able to accurately predict each on-screen death.

Are missed here .The remake has only one: Richard Dreyfuss as a gay passenger contemplating suicide. Petersen's stripped-down version jettisons the old script in favor of one by Mark Protosevich that invents new characters and scales their sob stories for short attention spans. Kurt Russell does the stalwart-hero honors as Robert Ramsey, a former mayor of New York who was once a firefighter and is now traveling with his hottie daughter (Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend (Mike Vogel), hoping they won't have sex, at least not in front of him. That's a lot of baggage for a character to carry when they could have just outfitted Russell with an eye patch, called him Snake Plissken and titled the film Escape From the North Atlantic.Josh Lucas has the most colorful role, as Dylan Johns, a professional gambler who hits on a young mom (Jacinda Barrett) vacationing with her son (Jimmy Bennett). The rest is spotting familiar faces from TV: That stowaway is Mia Maestro, from Alias, she is gorgeous so that helps.Director Wolfgang Petersen has the credentials to do a remake of the movie, based on a novel by Paul Gallico. Given that he's got his feet wet enough with Das Boot and The Perfect Storm, and enough experience helming big budgeted summer movies like Air Force One and Troy, however, what's the point of a remake? Perhaps it's for the action sequences, to see how far time has brought us with an update of stunt techniques . You'll end up entertained if you forgive the cliches and let Petersen grab you with the visuals, from the avalanche of water in the ballroom to the eerie sight of a flooded crawl space where wires take on the form of deadly tentacles. You don't expect a remake to spring surprises. This film has a few up its sleeve. Decent summer popcorn flick .",Poseidon
65,MaxBorg89,"Not that bad, actually...",8,20 June 2006,"I went to see this movie without really knowing what to expect: I hadn't seen the original 1972 disaster flick and the director, Wolfgang Petersen, is known for delivering films which are tense and/or exciting, such as Troy or Air Force One, but almost completely lacking any kind of depth in terms of characters and themes. With Poseidon he has done it again. Only a bit better.The story takes place on the huge, magnificent cruise ship Poseidon (its name, we're later told, derives from the Greek god of the ocean), where all the passengers are eagerly anticipating the new year. For about twenty minutes, everything's fine. Then a gigantic wave hits the ship, which finds itself floating upside-down. Since staying on board means certain death, a group of people, including a gambler (Josh Lucas), an ex mayor (Kurt Russell), his daughter (Emmy Rossum, who already dealt with over-sized waves in The Day After Tomorrow) and a suicidal gay man (Richard Dreyfuss) decide to make an attempt at getting the hell out of there. Ahead of them lies a difficult, increasingly dangerous journey...Now, some people may wonder if it was necessary to remake The Poseidon Adventure (although you might also question the definition of ""necessary""), or if it was a smart thing to do, releasing a big-budget disaster movie set on a ship just nine years after Titanic. Personally, I don't know why Warner Bros. decided to make this film. I can, however, say that I liked Poseidon. It's not the best movie I've seen this year (so far, that would be X-Men 3), but I didn't regret seeing it. For two reasons.One is the running time. At 1 hour and 40 minutes, it's quite shorter than your average action flick, although in this case ""short"" doesn't equal ""bad"". In fact, by keeping the focus on the main event alone (the group of people trying to survive), and ensuring it looks real, Petersen doesn't have to insert some kind of unrealistic contrivances to make it more dramatic.In addition, the director manages to keep the pace and suspense constant, partly because he's used to naval disasters (see Das Boot and The Perfect Storm), partly because we don't know which characters are going to bite the dust, since they're all different from the protagonists of the original. Apart from one or two predictable demises, the rest of the film reflects Kurt Russell's sentence:""There's nothing fair in who lives and who dies"". Everyone's expendable, and, since these are guys we actually like, that's the main reason the audience will keep waiting until the last minute to see who actually got out of that ship.Furthermore, the movie deserves a special mention for bringing Richard Dreyfuss back from oblivion (his last blockbuster was Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and his last important role was in Stand By Me, twenty years ago). Angry and sad (probably reflecting Dreyfuss's own attitude towards the movie business), his performance is arguably the most affecting in the film, which is quite something considering this is a summer blockbuster.So, if you're willing to give it a try, watch Poseidon. Unlike its subject matter, it doesn't sink.",Poseidon
66,jimbo-53-186511,"Slightly flawed, but far better than I was expecting it to be",7,12 February 2015,"As far as entertainment goes this is pretty much perfect. It's exciting, thrilling, intense & generally fairly well-acted. The Poseidon (like the original) has a no nonsense approach to film-making. We aren't giving a long boring introduction before the disaster occurs so whatever you may be feeling whilst the film is rolling it won't be boredom. However....The only big difference (and slight problem) with this remake is that its weaker in terms of character development and characterisation. The original seemed to manage to develop a few of the characters enough for us to care about them, but at the same time without drawing this element out for too long. In this remake, character development is overlooked meaning that you never care as much for these characters than you did for the characters in the original. In the original, the characters also felt more believable - quarrelling & general indecisiveness are much more believable character traits when you look at their predicament. However, in this remake Lucas just decides everything without anyone questioning him - how much better would it have been if there had been a power struggle between Lucas and Russell like there was between Borgnine and Hackman in the original? Other problems in this remake is that you quite simply don't care about the characters as much; I think the main reason for this is that the writers don't seem to care about the characters either. In the original film when someone died there was something made of it and again the characters were written in a way that made you care. In this film when a character dies, the writers just swiftly move on without a second's thought - the worse example of this was when Kurt Russell's character dies and no-one even bothers to go and look for him and nothing is really mentioned about his disappearance (they assume he's dead, but don't know it). How awful is that? You always got the feeling that they were a real team in the original and you could never imagine anyone leaving anyone else behind. It's a shame that the characterisation was so poor because other than that there's very little wrong with this film.On my real world scale this probably only deserves a 6, but I've given it a 7 because despite some of its flaws it is a very exciting and intense piece of cinema that will guarantee not to bore you. I believe with slightly better writing and characterisation that this could have been every bit as good as the original. However, considering it's a remake of a classic it really isn't that bad.",Poseidon
67,barnabyrudge,"Remake of a disaster classic, sometimes exciting but hurt by cardboard characterisation.",4,7 January 2009,"It's a brave move  one might even say a gamble  to attempt to remake a film like The Poseidon Adventure. The original might not be a flawless film, but it is nonetheless a fondly remembered film and, within the disaster genre, could quite conceivably be hailed as a classic. Here, Wolfgang Petersen takes advantage of the advances in technology, the increased possibilities of computer generated images and special effects, to bring us a more graphic and realistic-looking version of the story. However, Petersen overlooks a vital ingredient. something which made, and still makes, the 1972 version the better of the two films. That ingredient is characters worth caring about. Almost nothing is properly developed in this rushed-along, thrill-a-minute version. The back story of each key character is especially neglected, meaning that we find ourselves observing a group of survivors we know precious little about and don't really care whether they make it or not.New Years Eve aboard the cruise ship Poseidon  the party is in full swing when a rogue wave surges out of nowhere and overturns the ship. Many passengers are killed instantly; the others are left stranded in an alien upside-down environment. The Captain assures the survivors they will be rescued in time and should just sit tight. But a handful feel their best bet is to climb upwards  towards the bottom of the overturned ship. They are led by loner Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas)  among his band of followers are over-protective father Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), depressed gay man Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), pretty single mom Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett), and several others. The journey up is fraught with danger  burning obstacles, unstable elevator shafts, blocked doors, flooded corridors and much more. Step by step, they make their perilous ascent to the surface. but who will survive, and who will meet a grizzly end?The special effects are actually superb on the whole. The film opens with a wonderful opening shot which starts below the surface of the sea and moves up and out, circling the impressive ship several times, all in one take. For a moment one is almost hoodwinked into thinking a truly special movie might be underway! Then the uninspiring story kicks in, and Mark Protosevich's by-the-numbers script begins offering the most cursory of character sketches. Within a few minutes the ship has been tipped by the tidal wave and our band of hardy adventurers are on their way to safety or doom. Performance-wise, the film requires little of the stars and they play it in strictly one-dimensional terms. At one point, Dreyfuss has to kick another man to his death in order to save his own life. He's devastated about it for about thirty seconds, then the incident is never referred to again even though it clearly could, and should, have been used to add an interesting angle to his character. If viewed purely as a series of increasingly perilous set pieces of adventure, Poseidon is actually an acceptable enough film. But if you prefer your films with a bit more meat on their bones, this one will leave you largely under-nourished.",Poseidon

Josh Lucas makes for a good solid hero as he's determined to escape this death ship & he's a man the team look to in their horrific situation as they also do with Kurt Russell here & because Kurt is such an iconic movie star & screen presence for Classic films such as Big Trouble In Little China, The Thing & Escape From New York his presence is a comfort during this terrifying situation & we also get the great Dreyfuss who is also great here in a very good performance from a legend who gave us JAWS, Close Encounters, Stakeout & What About Bob?

OK, so there haven't been too many of these but the reason this one doesn't float away is because it focuses on the quest of getting out from under the ship and not much else. The beginning is pretty corny with the Black-eyed Peas front lady hosting the New Years Eve celebration singing some goofy songs while the rich gamble and party. Once the action starts and the rebel group head out to move up the ship once it turns itself upside down from the rogue wave, the focus doesn't stop til the end of the movie. This isn't a great movie but it does what it wants to do. Wolfgang Petersen is almost too used to these type of movies and I'd like to see him venture back towards the fantasy movies he used to make, but at least he does them well.

72,drystyx,Modernized version pays homage to original,6,11 January 2007,"Its hard to talk about this version of the movie without bringing up the original. In fact, most of the characters are copied onto the modernized version, and the production team lets us know they intend to pay a great deal of homage to the original by using the same names and bringing up the same ordeals as close as possible. Its not a spoiler to say that in this version, the wreck is brought about by terrorists, since that is revealed quite early in the screenplay. This post 9-11 strategy would normally be a bit too gung ho, but the emphasis is on the characters. The situations are the same, but the way the characters get there is somewhat different, and handled in a logical manner. The only flaw is the policeman character's determination to bring out a crazed suicide bomber out with them, as though he won't cause some major damage, either by death or maiming, in an emergency situation when the safety of the majority would be the normal procedure. The biggest change the director makes however is the obvious post 9-11 attitude of the characters, the attitude of people living in the information age as opposed to 1980 and before. Its revealed very overtly as the reason for the script. Before, people were amazed and excited very easily, but in the modern times, no one gets excited. The lack of rivalry and conflict between the characters is expounded upon. Sure, they cringe at death, and gasp when someone dies, but the sense of uniqueness no longer exists in modern society, and that is what this film is saying. A unique concept-the lack of emotion and conflict to demonstrate a statement.",Poseidon
73,EUyeshima,There's Got to Be a Morning After....Please,4,11 April 2007,"The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Petersen seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proved a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, ""Das Boot"" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, ""The Perfect Storm"". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.Petersen wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Petersen effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several ""making of"" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequently, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs.

Along for the ride are a despondent man with a broken heart, a couple of lovers, an angry father, a mother and her son, and a woman who can't seem to get a break (well, except for the wrong type... literally).The film is inspired by much of the original, but it has a few other details added and well executed special effects. Now there are more explosions, fires, bursts of dangerous wind, floods, and much debris along the underwater sequences. In the hands of Petersen, what could have been a confusing mess, as it has been demonstrated in other recent action releases, actually works very well. We feel the characters claustrophobia, fear, and both physical and emotional pain.From this movie, the one actor who is likely to win more recognition is Josh Lucas who makes some of the action scenes very believable because he looks the part of a hero and actually commands the screen. The rest of the cast is very much a supporting bunch, and they do a decent job, too.Much can be said about remaking classics, and one could argue that there is very little panache since we don't have many recognizable classic stars in this package, but maybe that makes this film a bit better than the original because now we have to concentrate on the development of the terrific action sequences.

You have to be an architect to fully appreciate that ships are not designed to float upside down.2. The best place to wait for rescue in an upside-down liner is somewhere surrounded by (now-submerged) windows...3. Bow thrusters are so powerful that, even in air, they can suck people and objects in through inspection hatches.4. Cruise liners apparently have inspection hatches built into bow-thruster tubes that can be opened at a whim, despite being under-water in normal circumstances.5. It's not just in Star Trek that anonymous crewmen die regularly.6. Ballast tanks have a clever ""automatic"" system that allows them all to flood simply by turning a handle in one of them.7. Said handle is located at the bottom of the ballast tank, meaning that, in normal use, once the tank had flooded, there would be no way to turn it off.8. After escaping, there will always be enough lifeboats for the survivors floating around.9. After surviving a capsize, characters can wander around the liner but will never encounter any other living things.10. Bow thrusters suck or blow relative to a point between them, meaning that in regular use, they would not actually do anything.I could go on, but you get the picture.

Richard Dreyfuss is caught up in the malaise, playing a homosexual scorned by his lover, teetering on the brink of suicide. Kevin Dillon was the only other recognisable face (to me) in the cast which was severely lacking familiar depth.Wolfgang Petersen is a talented director, but this effort, in my opinion, misses the point; it's focus is set design and pyrotechnics, and while those aspects are important in a film of this type, they shouldn't overshadow the characters. The original excelled due to the quality of the cast and their performances, complemented by the innovative sets; this remake, like its survivors race to the bottom, is starting at the wrong end.",Poseidon

What is lost in heartfelt drama and quandry as theme in the 1972 film (tagline: ""What would you do?

There's always something being destroyed, and mutilated corpses flying/laying/floating around everywhere. Yes, the special effects are magnificent--great attention to detail. The director really tried to capture what a ship being inverted by a massive rogue wave might look like, and does it well. You see the tragic results all over the ship--even a particularly morbid and gratuitous depiction of some unlucky folks in the lido deck pool.As for characters, all you get is some shallow split-second introductions: a brief poker game, some teen girl smooching her boyfriend, some despondent guy, a guy that drinks whiskey and acts stupid, and a lot of doomed extras who just scream (and then die horribly). But that's about it.The original succeeded because it was character driven--when someone died, you felt a sense of loss. Not here. You never learn the name of the victims. If you listen closely between explosions, you might catch a survivor's name here or there as the survivors argue incessantly about their escape route. When one of the main characters died, (true story) the person seated next to me actually leaned over and asked me who was killed. I didn't know, either. The whole storming, pulsating, chaotic, explosion-fest movie is like this. Because it maintains such a high level of action and entertains somewhat because of this, as well as the fact the actors really try with what they're given, I'll give this a generous 5.

It certainly has some implausibilities, as well as some plot holes, but it's never boring.

86,mstomaso,Doesn't Measure up to the Standards Set by the Original,4,18 October 2007,"Wolgang Petersen's remake of the classic Ronald Neame action-thriller The Poseiden Adventure is missing two important components which made the first worth remaking - Engaging characters and visual realism.Petersen is, for me, a hit-or-miss director. He tends to make big-budget films without a tremendous amount of character development, a lot of nice effects and excellent production values. this does not mean that all of his films are good - or even interesting for that matter. Nobody should be surprised by my comment about character development. Given the advancement in special effects since the 1972 original and the immense budget of Petersen's film, however, some might be surprised by my claim concerning realism. Here's what I mean: The Poseidon Adventure was a gritty, messy, dirty and frankly scary film. The emphasis of the original was on the character's predicament. the feeling of the film was not celebratory or even terrifically heroic. Instead, the heroism of most of the characters, when it did surface, was something of a surprise. And there was nothing about it which was in any way reminiscent of a computer game. Not so Wolfgang's film. The remake replaces the sea-sickness of the original with nicely done, crystal-clear CGI. Just doesn't make the same impression. In Petersen's film, a good, somewhat underexploited cast headed by Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are given a few minutes of largely ineffectual character development (more like stereotype development) and are then trapped in a capsized modern luxury liner from which their only escape is to climb to the ship's hull through a maze-like series of obstacles and escape through a ballast pipe and a propeller tube.I am never surprised to see Kurt Russell in a role that under-utilizes his abundant talent, and I was glad that Richard Dreyfus found a way to make his own character the most memorable in the film, but frankly, even at the end of the film, I was having a hard time differentiating between the different survivors' personalities. If I was unable to see them, I would probably have been only able to distinguish their sex (the female roles consisted mainly of screaming and panic) and - maybe - some semblance of what they were doing. All considering, the acting was good - though hampered by the script and - though I hate to say it - the plot. Unexpectedly good performance of the film? Mia Maestro as Elena.Not a bad film for an evening's non-serious entertaining, but don't go out of your way.",Poseidon
87,emasterslake,A 21st Century remake of a 1972 classic.,5,30 May 2006,"This Poseidon movie is based off of the novel and the original movie.Just to let you know that this remake is different from the other one.It has the same plot involving a cruise ship being tipped over by the a tidal wave by Midnight on New Years Day.The first part is rushed and we don't get to know too much about the main survivors. In the original they spent a lot of time in introducing the main survivors. The tidal wave has a lot of detail and you get to see more detail and damage than the original had. You just see more people dying than the original.The movie is action packed never a dull moment. Not to mention it having more violence than the original had.And another thing to know is that this movie didn't had many unsuspecting moments. In other words there's too many parts where you'd be like ""I thought so, I saw it coming"". It be better if they had scenes where you wouldn't suspect what's about to happen.This remake isn't too bad. Just it's missing Character development. I wish they'd focus more on Richard Dreyfuss's character. Cause Richard Dreyfuss is a great actor who deserves a good part.So if you like the classic, just warn about this one. This is nothing like the one you grew up with from 34 years ago.",Poseidon
88,mentalcritic,Meh...,2,30 September 2006,"I have read other critics putting down this remake for the absence of camp or what they perceive as racism. Nice of them to provide a new definition of missing the mark. For I prefer what they perceive as racism over tokenism any day of the week, and speaking as a member of a hidden minority, I would like them to chew on the fact that skin colour is not the only thing that makes us all different. That said, camp is dead. Adam West and his ilk killed it a long time ago, and it especially does not fit in an era where rather than spend excessive amounts on spurious items because we can, we must penny-pinch until our fingers fall off. No, the real problem in Poseidon spreads in so many directions that it is impossible to nail down to one source. About the only thing that does work is the acting, and even that gets lost in the maze due to what must qualify as one of the most lacklustre scripts of the last six years. Still, I am getting ahead of myself, as there is so much to dissect within this rotten mound of celluloid.Many have spoken of the rotten characterisations, especially of Kurt Russell. Kurt's character stinks not because he has nothing in common with the other characters we normally would associate with Kurt. No, it is much deeper than that. Several scenes occur in which one questions whether the father of an adult child would act in this fashion, and the answer is almost always no. The one moment where he does do something a man in his position would is struck down by the almost total absence of character development. Kurt has no illusions that he is Lawrence Olivier or Peter O'Toole, but he has done much better with stronger material. Emmy Rossum also valiant fights the tide of her lousy character, and she shows that she has a potential to go to far greater places with her acting skill, but only if she chooses better scripts in future. Josh Lucas, Mike Vogel, and Kevin Dillon fight valiantly against the tidal wave that is the script (or lack thereof), but are swiftly overcome. The rest of the cast exist mainly as props.If anything, Richard Dreyfuss' character is too politically correct. It seems that Mark Protosevich decided he needed to have one character not like everyone else, but instead of writing a script that shows him to have different motivations or ideas, Mark simply takes the Dreyfuss character and stamps the word ""gay"" in big letters on his head. One should take note of this, as it is what passes for diversity in this stupid film. But this only serves to highlight the real problem with Poseidon. Namely, the filmmakers try to show too much in too little time. Ninety-eight minutes is sufficient for a fast-paced action film, of the variety that the likes of Dolph Lundgren or Arnold Schwarzenegger made their bread and butter. For a character study in which half a dozen people struggle both against themselves and nature's dark side, it is not nearly enough. Poseidon would have gained so much from another half hour or so to properly set the characters up, explain their motives, and more importantly, explain why the audience should care what happens to them.People bemoan special effects all the time, as if their advancement automatically results in a lesser story. Having grown up with such films as RoboCop or Total Recall, I can say this popular moan is also pure nonsense. Poseidon's special effects, for what they are, could have enhanced a story, but the story on offer here is too weak to allow this. What we mainly have is a string of disaster film scenes stitched together with very little basis. One character has a massive piece of debris land on him, and we fail to care. Others drown, and while drowning is one of the most horrible ways I can imagine to die, I honestly cared more about the chocolate milk I was drinking at the time. Yes, I have problems when special effects are used inappropriately (the Slap Shot quote from one referee ""too much, too soon"" applies to one example I can think of), but as hard as I tried here, I could not spot a shot I would have done differently. Script pieces, yes, special effects shots, no.If there is one good thing about Poseidon, it is the sound design. Metal, water, and fire all work together in a soundstage that gives one the feeling of being boxed into a sinking ship. One great director has said that sound is more than half the experience of cinema, and Poseidon does nothing to challenge the notion. When hapless passengers are smashed, burned, or electrocuted, the sound does the script's job, or at least tries to. Oddly enough, apart from the scenes in the lounge before the capsising, I honestly cannot remember any of the music. Which is either very clever, or another case of a crew member slacking off, depending on how you see it. Speaking of crew members, I noticed there are no less than twelve producers credited with this mess, including the same Akiva Goldsman whose name is associated with the dreadful Lost In Space update. In fact, most of his production credits relate to an update or remake of an old story that really did not need it. Nor should it surprise anyone that one of his screen writing credits is none other than The Da Vinci Code.When all is said and done, Poseidon is a distinct two out of ten film. Its just too bad to be any good, and too clinical to be any fun. It is totally stuck in no man's land.",Poseidon
89,Victor Field,"Can you wait for a remake of ""The Swarm"" or ""When Time Ran Out...""? Yes, so can I.",4,17 June 2006,"Boats don't seem to be lucky for Freddy Rodriguez on screen; his character met his maker on a cruise ship in the last episode of ""Six Feet Under,"" and in ""Poseidon"" he's the first of the band of heroes to be killed off. In one of the few moments that indicate how much of a better movie this could have been, it's not so much his death as the circumstances of it that are striking (it tops similar moments in ""Vertical Limit"" and another (but far superior) disaster movie with Emmy Rossum, ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" because it's not a heroic self-sacrifice like the latter or a convenient way to kill the villain, save the good guys and atone for personal guilt at the same time like the former - Richard Dreyfuss basically, and to be fair unwillingly, has to kill him so that the others have a chance)... but then nothing much is made of it. Or much of any of the characters.Wolfgang Petersen certainly knows his water what with ""Das Boot,"" the climax of ""Air Force One"" and the logo for his company (Radiant Productions - sun shining over a tranquil sea), and this isn't as bad as I was afraid it was going to be (it's certainly more watchable than ""Lost in Space,"" which ain't that hard anyway), but even without comparing it to the original movie it almost never catches fire; with most of our heroes mono-dimensional no-narks (it figures that the liveliest one, Kevin Dillon, should be among the ones to bite it) it's pretty hard to care whether or not they make it out - yours truly kept getting Josh Lucas and that guy who plays Miss Rossum's boyfriend confused, which isn't a plus. Dreyfuss and Mia Maestro do manage to make some kind of positive impression, and it's amusing to see Kurt Russell start to turn into Nick Nolte, but most of the others are either wasted (Andre Braugher in particular) or nondescript.The hand of Akiva Goldsman had to have been brought onto that dialogue (Russell: ""Everyone can see..."" Rossum, playing his daughter: ""The twins?""), the reduced running time is more the work of savage editors than the script (although Mike Vogel's aching legs after being pulled out from under the wreckage in the disco never seem to hinder him again...), the standard army of FX studios (ILM, The Moving Picture Company, Giant Killer Robots and so on) turn in work ranging from excellent (like the capsizing) to dire (like the shamelessly fake oil that ushers in a pillar of fire), and unfortunately this was one time that Petersen left the music intact; Klaus Badelt proves that he's no John Williams (like we didn't know already), and the less said about Her Butterfaceness Queen Stacy of Ferguson and that awful sub-Celine Dion dirge over the end credits the better. This all seems a bit like a video game rather than a movie, with people facing challenges to get to the next stage. And about as emotionally stirring.But as I said earlier, there are some strong moments - the air vent sequence is genuinely tense (and it's refreshing to see an air vent in a movie which isn't big enough to fit an SUV in for once), the opening journey around the boat is pretty decent, and a couple of the fates met by key characters are truly affecting. Overall, though, the best thing you can say about the movie is that it's better than ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" - although if you must watch a big-budget box office bomb with Josh Lucas, you might be better off with ""Stealth."" I never thought I'd say that.",Poseidon
90,marcin_kukuczka,Poseidon - god of seas; POSEIDON - no god of movies! Nothing special!,3,4 June 2006,"I am not a fan of such films and when TITANIC was released, I had to encourage myself to see this for a long time. When POSEIDON was released in my country recently, I also did not feel particularly curious of it since there was nothing eye-catching in the trailer and the content itself is nothing extraordinary - a tragedy on the luxurious ship and people's deaths. Yet, there were two primary factors I decided to see this: the director Wolfgang Petersen and the actress Emmy Rossum. However, both of them also disappointed me equally as the entire movie.Petersen did a great job with his TROY two years ago but this film is a boredom throughout. Although there are some impressive moments, particularly the one showing the huge wave, but to be honest, nothing is exceptionally worth attention. The entire film seems to be extremely unnatural, the thrill is gone very soon and the reaction of audiences is usually the one of a silly laughter (indeed not the one the film attempts at). Imagine a 20 minute long scene of a group of people crawling through tiny passages in order to get to a safer place while the flooding increases. Most of the action, in fact, concerns this group who are constantly trying to find a way out and... most of them manage just a few minutes before the ship disappears in the waters of the ocean. Although there is nothing more to say about the content that it is a story of people's tragedies while a ship drowns, there is one great factor about the movie: the sentence ""I love you"" which is what people usually want to tell one another before they die.CAST: The performances are exceptionally weak. Kurt Russell does no great job as Robert Ramsey, a ridiculous role of a father so much caring for his daughter that he even tells her what to wear; Emmy Rossum, whom I admired in THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, shows nothing special as Jennifer Ramsey, a young woman who finds her first love. Most of her acting is deadly unnatural. Perhaps Jacinda Berret was not bad as Maggie: she sometimes expresses this shock and panic well. Yet, this film is no feast for the soul concerning performances. The cast clearly found it difficult to play such roles...To sum up, I don't have much more to say about this film than the fact that it is ""no god of movies - no masterpiece."" It is a boring film that does not have much to offer. There is perhaps some visual effect to see this on a big screen, but I cannot imagine watching this movie on television. It even lacks the thrill that seems to be the core purpose of the genre. 3/10!",Poseidon

Most likely, I would have been happier going in late to ""United 93,"" but still, I felt I got my money's worth of entertainment and spectacle. Low expectations may well have been the key to my enjoyment.""Poseidon"" is not really a remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" as much as it is a reinvention, just as ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" wasn't a really a remake of the original Romero classic. The situation is the same: a luxury liner is overturned by a tidal wave on New Year's Eve, and a small band of survivors makes its way to the bottom/top of the upside-down vessel, braving fire, water, and sundry loose objects on the way. Some die, and the rest get out before the ship plunges to Davey Jones' locker.Wolfgang Petersen's version has little of the character development of the original epic, but I found this to be small liability. A disaster film is properly concerned with the unfolding of the disaster, followed by the exploits of the survivors to weather the aftermath, and ""Poseidon"" accomplishes this quite well, if only with the usual disaster movie quota of stretched believability (c.f. holding your breath underwater while performing extraordinary deeds). The character types are quickly and succinctly drawn: the pro gambler ""hero"" (Josh Lucas), the capable ex-mayor/firefighter father (Kurt Russell), his plucky daughter (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancé (Mike Vogel), the hapless single mom (Jacinda Barrett) and her frightened child (Jimmy Bennett), a briefly suicidal businessman (Richard Dreyfuss) for whom disaster grants a new interest in living, the likable minority who dies halfway through the film (Freddy Rodriquez) and his minority girlfriend (Mia Maestro) who doesn't, along with the obligatory name cameo (Kevin Dillon) who dies earlier than you might expect, and the identifiable musical performer (Stacy Ferguson) who is equally doomed to die. Mark ""The Cell"" Protosevich's script dispenses with all but the sketchiest of backstory and gets to the action ASAP. Think of it as ""Titanic"" without the romantic plot.Visually, ""Poseidon"" is impressive. John Seale's cinematography is amazing, especially the opening reveal of the ship, and is well complemented by the art, sound, and production design. The rogue tidal wave is awe-inspiring, gorgeous CGI. There are a few moments of ""oh, c'mon!"" (as mentioned, mostly sequences of extended underwater activity) and I missed the sublime imagery of a graceful fat woman swimming underwater, but all in all, ""Poseidon"" delivers the requisite goods.I find it interesting that IMDb females rate the film higher than the males. Possibly this can be attributed to a lack of gratuitous exposure of flesh by the ladies in the film, perhaps not. Maybe it's just the Josh Lucas ""hunk"" factor, or maybe it's just the relatively small audience sampling that the IMDb vote represents, I don't know. At any rate, the film does what it intends to do, which is convince you that you don't want to be anywhere near a cruise ship that gets flipped by a tidal wave.Summation: instantly forgettable but entertaining nonetheless.",Poseidon
92,vip_ebriega,"Standard disaster movie formula, but has its moments.",6,14 March 2007,"My Take: A great ride, even if the human dimension and genre clichés are stale. I watched The original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" on video, and pretty-well enjoyed it. It was well buffered with drama, suspense and action, some real good elements for a classy disaster flick. I wasn't expecting the classic elements of the original, and so, I found it swell. Too bad I missed it on the theaters, but I do have it on DVD. It was a good disaster movie, if you stay with the fact that it's a remake. The original, somewhat dated it may be, was such an enjoyable movie that had everything a disaster movie requires, that ""Poseidon"" sinks in comparison. It is a well crafted thrill ride, but even the for mindless action fare, we expect more from a top director like Wolfgang Petersen. Well, he did an okay job, but he was really an Oscar-worthy director of top-notch adventure flicks.Anyway, POSEIDON had a decently-assemble cast, too bad their characters were quite pale. In fact, it feels like they just picked any survivor and have them dodge every obstacle while the audience feel nothing for their salvation. Disaster movies are pure formulaic Hollywood hokum, but they are always carried by characters, one-dimensional they may be, that we may actually care about. In POSEIDON, I found myself admiring the special effects-heavy destruction but feel nothing about the people trying to evade them. I'm sure the late Irwin Allen would have approved this remake. Though it sucks out every bit of humanity the 1978 camp classic had, it does amp up the action level. Petersen was able to capsize the Poseidon a little longer than in the original film, not sparing the sight of dozens of nameless extras either being drowned, electrocuted, or thrown to their deaths. This moment alone is Petersen, who directed other disaster-at-sea like DAS BOOT and THE PERFECT STORM, doing his best. Sadly, when the film takes us to its second hour with survivors dodging the the vessels shaking and burning death traps, it's hard to really care about any of the characters. If only that it delivers all the traditional disaster ques, POSEIDON is enjoyable though disposable fare.Rating: *** out of 5.",Poseidon
93,dglink,Shelley Winters Where Are You?,7,12 May 2006,"Wolfgang Petersen certainly knows how to helm a pulse-pounding action-suspense film. While not in the same league as his masterwork, ""Das Boot,"" ""Poseidon,"" a streamlined remake of Irwin Allen's 1972 classic ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" takes off quickly and provides a non-stop adrenaline rush for the next 99 minutes. The script, based on the original Paul Gallico novel, has been honed to its basic action elements and is about twenty minutes shorter than the earlier movie. However, the film's brevity may be too much of a good thing. A lot of the fun in the original film came from scene stealers like Shelley Winters, who provided some respite from the ordeal. Although ""Poseidon"" does have some kitschy dialog and characters that stop during tense moments for groan-inducing personal reflections, the film generally adheres closely to the action as a motley group of cruise-ship passengers struggle up to the bottom of their overturned vessel.The special effects in ""Poseidon"" are all that a reported $150 million can buy, and a couple of scenes, including the initial tidal wave, are breathtaking. Unlike its predecessor, the remake does not flinch from showing the grim details of violent death, and bodies abound as the survivors stumble along ceilings and up through the decks to the bottom of the ship, which is all that remains above the surface of the ocean. Although the producers did not pinch the special effects budget, they certainly did not expend much on the cast. While ""The Poseidon Adventure"" boasted a cast of stars that included a few Oscar winners, ""Poseidon"" has few familiar names besides Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfus. The well-known stars of the original film brought audience recognition with them, and viewers cared about their fates. Unfortunately, with little dialog to develop character and largely unknown faces before the camera, the fates of those on screen evoke little interest beyond the guessing game of ""who will survive?""However, for undemanding action fans, ""Poseidon"" is a near-two-hour non-stop ride that is reminiscent of the second half of ""Titanic."" Petersen's more-than-competent direction keeps the film, if not the ship, on an even keel, although those with long memories will likely be drawn back to the original film, which was more entertaining, if less spectacular. Rarely should films be longer than they already are, but, in the case of ""Poseidon,"" a bit more character development, a few pauses to let the audience catch their breath, and a few light moments to relieve the tension would have been welcome. Where is Shelley Winters when you really need her?",Poseidon
94,fwomp,"Too Heavy On The CGI, Not Enough About The Characters",3,7 November 2006,"When word that Wolfgang Petersen  director of such fantastic films as DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM  was slated to direct the remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (now shortened to simply POSEIDON), the sizzling hype around Hollywood was immediately palpable. Production costs for the heavily CGI-laden film skyrocketed to $160 million, making it one of the most costly films of 2005 (released in 2006).Adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring Josh Lucas (GLORY ROAD), Kurt Russell (SKY HIGH), Richard Dreyfuss (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS), Emmy Rossum (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004), Freddy Rodriguez (LADY IN THE WATER), and Kevin Dillon (24 TV Series).Now The Poseidon Adventure (1972) wasn't that great a film to begin with, but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by Karen Carpenter (""It's Got To Be The Morning After"") and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event: the capsizing of a cruise ship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelly Winters, and Jack Albertson rounded out that all-star cast. And although the production was a bit cheesy by today's standards, it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice. This was the focus. The destruction of the ship was just the catalyst, not the focal point. Which is where Wolfgang's remake encounters significant problems.The character set-up in Poseidon is rushed, never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard. More film time is given to the CGI water, fires, explosions, and other non-character items. Many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship, then we're jerked back to the characters who don't really respond to it. So what was the purpose of showing the movie-watcher these things? The simple answer is because it was CGI, it was cool, it cost money, so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses.Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer. Most will probably say, ""So what"" when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive CGI water, fire, or explosion.Hollywood needs to learn that it's the people in the film audiences care about, not the ""totally awesome"" special effects.

The film about a cruise ship that capsizes thanks to a tidal wave. Bastard! Poseidon was the wrong choice for more than the obvious reason given above. Second to the embarrassment upon my realization, Poseidon was just an upside down mess of a movie that does little to thrill, chill or entertain its paying customers.Based on the Irwin Allen 1972 film, The Poseidon Adventure, Poseidon casts Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss and Emily Rossum as a few of the unsuspecting passengers of the cruise ship on the fateful day that a gigantic wave capsized the floating city.The initial wave hitting the boat was spectacular. In just minutes we see people being thrust overboard, people falling to their deaths and the expected chaos that would erupt if fiction ever laid claim to fact. The capsizing happens relatively early in the film (hell, at 99 minutes there is no time to waste), and there is nothing in the form of character development up to the money shot. All we really know is that the Lucas character is a gambler, Russell was once a mayor, Dreyfuss is the token gay guy and Rossum is Russell's daughter who is all sexed up with nowhere to go. They all have screen names, but I didn't get attached to remember any so I will give them the same treatment in my review that Mark Protosevich (The Cell) gave the screenplay.This group of unlikelies fend together and navigate through the upside down vessel in an attempt to make it to the propeller room where the Lucas character believes they can escape. Standing in their way will be blocked doors, fires, rising sea water and all the attitude of a group of people with varying backgrounds can provide when put in a situation of life and death. Sounds more exciting than it actually was, trust me.Along the way, some will live (talk about your non-spoiler), some will die and some audience members will reach into their pockets and count what is left of their $20 they had prior to getting to the box office to determine how it could have been better spent.But wait a minute. Maybe I am being too hard on an 'event film' like Poseidon. Maybe I should just enjoy the special effects and the claustrophobia that comes from being in small cabin rooms and hallways that are quickly becoming engulfed in sea water.If I did, Poseidon might get an extra half star out of me. The effects are quite good, but so were the effects in the original almost 35 years previous. And to be honest, once the ship flips, I the effects took on an almost made-for-TV type feel. The sets are larger, but hell, $150 million has to buy you something right? Effects out of the picture, Poseidon is a mess. Other characters are introduced and meet their demise as if the director, Wolfgang Peterson (Troy, Das Boot) was ticking them off a checklist. Some we are happy to see go (Kevin Dillon's character is ridiculous, annoying and serves no purpose other than to increase the body count) while others like Andre Braugher disappear before we even notice.The ending of Poseidon is also less effective than its predecessor. Anyone over 35 will remember Gene Hackman, the priest, hanging sacrificing himself for the survival of the others while cursing God for putting them in that position (""What more do you want from us!!!!""). Poseidon 2006's ending is far less involving. Even just hours after its conclusion, I can't remember exactly who survived the wreck and I don't feel any worse for wear because of it.The 1972 version spawned a sequel, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure, that continued the story of the ship once a salvage crew became aware of the treasures she encased. Let's hope that Poseidon does the right thing and just takes its restful place amongst the seas bottom.www.robertsreviews.com",Poseidon
97,russem31,"Um, this was average.",6,20 May 2006,"""Poseidon"", the 2006 remake of the the 1972 version ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is average at best. Though helmed by master director Wolfgang Peterson, this is no ""The Perfect Storm"" nor ""Das Boot"". It really seems like just another typical Hollywood action flick and that's what makes it disappointing. The action is definitely there, but there isn't that little extra magic that makes for a great film. Perhaps that's because there's no character development with one-sided and unmemorable characters, perhaps it's the predictability of the story (many of us have seen the original 1972 version), perhaps it was the average action music (unlike James Horner's music in ""Titanic""). I really don't know, only that I wasn't truly entertained. Oh well, it could have been worse I guess - this time around, a 6 out of 10.",Poseidon
98,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A mouse in a maze,4,22 February 2007,"A big New Years celebration aboard on of the World's biggest cruise ships comes to a halt when the ship is struck by a massive wave. The survivors then try to find a way out of the sinking capsized ship.Spectacular effects, huge impressive sets, and tense action make the movie fun to watch in a silly way. Lots of destruction and peril as the main characters face a series of difficult obstacles and the tensions between them. Sadly, that latter dramatic element is not nearly as developed as the film's aesthetic design. It is pretty much just cotton candy drama that seems to come standard with disaster flicks now. You learn virtually nothing about the characters throughout the film other than what their introductions tell you about them. That essentially boils this film down to watching a mouse go through an unusually complex maze - they go up, they go down, and... well that is it.What you do learn from watching this shipwreck is the fact that special effects are getting bigger and better. The opening shot, for instance, is pretty cool and it molds nice CGI with some live action. Then there is the big wave sequence which is probably the only reason why anyone ended up seeing this movie in the first place. All very nice, but it is all like a huge banana split - looks good, tastes good, but after a while you don't really feel like finishing it and ultimately leads nowhere. --- 4/10Rated PG-13 for violent action",Poseidon
99,RonellSowes,Shines new light on the original,2,10 February 2021,"After a wave capsizes a cruise ship, a handful of passengers must band together and find their way out. Of course like so many other films, most of the characters have their own personal problems to overcome as they work their way out of a sinking ship. And like much else in this film it rings false and doesn't make you care a bit more about them. But then again does anyone really care about the outcome of this film? I doubt it. Because you don't believe in it and hence, you can't be interested in it. It just feels like watching a bunch of actors pretending to be in danger-the antithesis of a movie's objective. And this the product of a feeble cast (excluding Russell and Dreyfuss),some pretty horrible writing and a suprisingly bad effort from Wolfgang Petersen. Petersen is a director who can create substantial tension in a film as in the taut,thriller In The Line Of Fire, but there is no suspense or drama what so ever in this film. Perhaps the only aspect of the film that isn't entirely underwhelming and impassive are the descions about who dies.I think if you examine enough people's reviews(including mine)you will see they came to the same conclusion. The Poseidon Adventure is a mediocre film that definetly held room for improvement but it looks pretty good next to Poseidon.",Poseidon
100,Son_of_Mansfield,The imperfect movie.,5,24 February 2007,"One thing that the original got right was that it had a human element. Shelly Winters' aging swimmer trying to save everyone. Ernest Borgnine's tough cop disbelieving all the way. This movie doesn't have enough of that. Kurt Russell gets one good hero line at the beginning and then nothing else. There are a lot of quasi gory deaths, if that's what you are looking for. But, if you are smart, you won't find much among the cookie cutter characters and dead bodies. There is Kevin Dillon's annoying wannabe card shark who can't die soon enough, Richard Dreyfuss' happy architect, Josh Lucas' loner and Emmy Rossum's marriage bound daughter. All are overpowered by the bland boat which reminds me of the boat from Speed 2: large, ugly, and unavoidable. Kind of like this movie. The best part is that it's only ninety minutes long.",Poseidon
101,jdkraus,"An action flick, nothing more",5,9 December 2006,"I agree with many people, the 1970s film a hit. It had everything a disaster film needed, action, ambivalent characters, and intense film-making. To admit truthfully, I had no high hopes for this remake of Poseidon.To put in simple terms, it was not that great. It wasn't a bomb, but it wasn't spectacular. it had a substantial amount of action with some spectacular special effects that looked realistic fro the tidal wave to the destruction of the ship. But the film lacked a story. It had a story, but it didn't have any real energy to carry it out, except for the action/visual effects.The story doesn't work well either, because the characters aren't developed, and the actors were not well chosen. Kurt Russel and Josh Lucas may have been heroes, but they were no Gene Hackman. Richard Dreyfus, a talented actor from past films didn't fit in for his role. He hardly spoke in the whole full! Since it was an action flick, the time flew by. It was a good 90 minute diversion fro mdaily activities but nothing more. ** out of **** Want a good disaster film, see the original Poseidon.",Poseidon
102,Isaac5855,"Technically Competent, but emotionally empty...",4,21 March 2007,"POSEIDON is the 2006 theatrical remake of the 1972 classic about an ocean liner that is capsized by a 90-foot tidal wave on New Year's Eve and the struggle for a handful of passengers to get to the bottom (top) of the boat before it sinks. Irwin Allen's widow, Sheila is listed in the opening credits as Executive Producer, which surprised me because I cannot believe that she actually put her seal of approval on this. This re-thinking, as opposed to a remake, really only borrows the basic premise of the original. In '72 the Poseidon was an old barge on its last legs making what was supposed to be its final voyage. Here, the Poseidon is a state of the art ocean liner that appears to have something like seven or eight decks. The ship includes scenic elevators and there is a casino and a disco. The opening shot of the movie where the camera sweeps around the ship is breathtaking, but director Wolfgang Petersen's obsession with getting to the sinking meant other sacrifices and the main one was too little exposition that didn't allow us time to care about these people before the ship turned over. We've barely been introduced to the characters when the tidal wave hits and as the journey to survival begins, we really don't care because the characters here don't even begin to resemble the characters in the original and it's hard to care about what happens to them. Two of the few likable characters in the movie, a gambler named Lucky Larry, played by Kevin Dillon and a galley worker played by Freddy Rodriguez, are eliminated early on and the rest of the survivors are pretty intolerable. There is a mother and son played by Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennet (Harrison Ford's son in FIREWALL)who you just want to strangle 20 minutes into the movie. The movie features state of the art special effects, but after the ship turns over, it becomes completely devoid of interest because we don't learn enough about these characters to care about them the way we cared about Hackman's priest and Shelley Winters' little old lady swimming champ. The best thing about the movie is that it clocks in under 90 minutes.",Poseidon

104,Antagonisten,Failed to capture my attention,4,1 February 2007,"I can admit right away that i have never been a huge fan of disaster-movies. There are a few though that have stuck in my mind and have become the scale after which i weigh all other such movies. The first is ""The Towering Inferno"". I remember watching it when i was little and i thought it was about the best thing i'd ever seen. Of course i probably wouldn't think that if i watched it now, but i'm not going to spoil the memory.One of the other movies that i really like remember is the old Poseidon-movie. It made me very hesitant to watch this remake since usually remakes of movies that i really like become quite disappointing. I don't know if my expectations were really that high for ""Poseidon"", but in a way i was still disappointed. There is definitely something missing from this movie.Let's start out with the good points. The special effects are many times amazing and the movie looks really nice. It's well made visually and the most exciting moments are mostly created from that fact. Also the acting was pretty good, many of the actors are known faces and they do alright. The the not-so-good points. Which are actually harder to put my finger on. Like i said earlier there is definitely something missing from this movie that makes it less engaging and exciting than it should have been. A lot of people here on IMDb have mentioned the fact that the characters are cardboard cut-outs and not interesting in the least. That might be a big part of it for me too. I still wonder when film-makers are going to understand that if you want people to care about the movie and how it ends, they must make you care about the characters! I don't think the characters were all of it though. There is something else about this movie that just fails to capture my attention. I sat and watched it on DVD and i constantly found myself doing other things while watching it. Reading a newspaper, looking out the window, getting up and going out for a second without pausing the movie. It just didn't hold my attention successfully. And for a movie that is supposed to build on suspense, that is not very good. I guess much of it was that the premise of the movie just wasn't as interesting now as it was the first time around. And also i could almost tell which people were going to survive even before the movie started, film-makers are just too predictable when it comes to that.There was nothing really wrong with this movie, it's not terrible in any way. But something about it just didn't feel very interesting or exciting. Maybe i watched it on the wrong day, maybe it's just not my kind of movie. Whatever it is, it didn't ""do"" it for me.",Poseidon

I generally just skip doing the review altogether in those cases BUT I can't resist so...this wasn't bad - more that it felt rushed and was like Chinese Food...satisfying but leaves you wanting. Also many of the cast were just not needed and I found myself wondering what their point was? Like Kevin Dillon...we needed an actor to say a few lines about Kurt Russell? Coulda just used Emmy Rossum to deliver those. She already had her hackles raised about Kurt so what's a couple more lines? Fergie? Not necessary - just an obvious high profile flavor of the moment used to get more box office numbers. Jacinda Barrett? Not necessary. Mia Maestro? Nope. Richard Dreyfuss. Nah. Freddy Rodriguez. Again no. Andre Braugher. Huh uh. I get that they were doing a remake but those characters were not needed this time around. Should've just focused on a very select few to make a bigger impact. Did anyone care when some of these people died? No. I kinda didn't care that much when Kurt did and I love me some Kurt.Josh Lucas is like those beautiful bakery desserts you see and want just because they are so aesthetically pleasing to look at but then once you take a bite you realize there is no substance and nothing to justify the price you paid for appearance. He's like window dressing but he's kind of...meh.The whole thing seemed bloated and unnecessary. This was one remake that just didn't need to be remade.Oh and the little kid in this movie - Jimmy Bennett - is the one Asia Argento slept with when she was 37...and he was 17 and that's all I could think about when I watched this which kind of took me out of it because that's just gross.

106,the-movie-guy,A disaster movie that is bound to sink fast,5,12 May 2006,"(Synopsis) During the New Year's Eve party celebration aboard the cruise ship Poseidon, a rogue wave hits the ship broadside and flips the ship upside down. The passengers and crew are thrown to the ceiling in a free fall and many are killed by debris and the fall, or drown. The captain and several hundred survivors are trapped inside the Main Ballroom. The captain wants everyone to stay in the ballroom and wait for rescue to come. However, Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional gambler, would rather take the odds of finding his own way out. Dylan is followed by Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) who must find his daughter. Before long, Dylan has a group of survivors who decide to go with him. A young waiter (Freddy Rodriguez) knows the layout of the ship and helps guide them upward through the ship. The group must work their way through a maze of twisted steel and debris, and the disorienting effect of being upside down. The group bonds together and is determined to find their way to the surface before the ship sinks.(My Comment) This is a remake of the 1972 disaster movie. I think it was much better than the first and that is not saying much, because I didn't like that one. The CG special effects inside the ship were very good. This is not your typical movie, because it was very tough for the actors to work in such conditions. If you have a little claustrophobia, do not go to this movie. The movie gives you the feel and effect of people being in enclosed places with water moving up right behind them. Some of the storyline was just impossible; maybe those scenes could have been used in Mission Impossible. You can wait to see this movie on TV, because it won't take long.

At the end of the film I couldn't really care less who would die and who would live - there wasn't enough time to start any feelings for any characters.The adventure on the ship itself was done nice enough I guess, but the film really should have been about 30 minutes longer --- just to get the characters introduced and work the relations between them out some better.5 out of 10 very bored moments in the cinema",Poseidon
108,MichaelMargetis,"""You don't just get the name Lucky Larry... you have to be LUCKY!"" - Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon)",4,20 June 2006,"The original Poseidon Adventure was a great film. Out-dated, yes, but it still remains a pretty decent action/drama picture. It had actors like Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgine and Shelley Winters who actually was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Hollywood has a habit of re-making movies that necessarily shouldn't be remade, but they do it anyway for two reasons. The first is because of their never-ending stomach-turning lust for money, and the other is because hardly anyone in Hollywood has a good original idea anymore. Poseidon, by it's previews promises excellent visual effects, and I have to admit this 2005 version of Poseidon had great special effects with all sorts of sh*t flying through the air impaling and crushing people and such, but the story and the acting flat-out stinks. I thought 'Poseidon' would really work, but believe me I was wrong.The story is familiar in that we follow the lives of different people on the ship. We have a rogue loner with a charming smile (Josh Lucas), an irritated hard-boiled ultra-cool dad (Kurt Russell), his hot but typical daughter (Emmy Rossum), his daughter's dumbshit boyfriend (Mike Vogel), a feisty latina (Mia Maestro), a mother and her whiny pain-in-the-ass son (Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett), the brave captain (Andre Braugher), a selfish gambler (Kevin Dillon), a chef (Freddy Rodriguez) and an eccentric gay old architect (Richard Dreyfuss). Know, you'd think with an array of characters, the dialogue and situations would be entertaining, but they aren't. I'm still wondering if perhaps director Wolfgang Petersen hired a chimpanzee to write the script, because horrible is a word too generous to describe it. The dialogue constantly drags, with every sappy scenario every used embedded in it. The writer tries to provoke emotion from the viewer with his character development, but tell you the truth I was glad a great deal of these people died because they were too boring and stupid to care about (except Andre Braugher, he was freakin' bad ass in his short role.)When it's all said and done, the special effects save the film. It's worth seeing alone for the cool action sequences, but besides that the film doesn't really have a redeeming quality. The writing is terrible, the plot is too drawn-out and dare I say borderline retarded (sorry if I offended anybody), and Wolfgang Petersen seems to bring out the worst acting in everyone involved. I usually like Kurt Russell and I love Richard Dreyfuss, but they are terrible in this. Emmy Rossum is pretty good, but she was perhaps the most dreadful of all. The only decent performance is from Andre Braugher who plays the ultra-cool captain who has about a ten-minute part. 'Poseideon' is a movie I don't recommend, but if you want to see it, just for the special effects, don't say I didn't warn you about how bad everything else is. Grade: C",Poseidon

112,moviemanMA,Abandon this film!,3,22 May 2006,"In 1972, The Poseidon Adventure opened to audiences around the world. It was a harrowing tale of overcoming unimaginable obstacles and surviving the impossible disaster; escaping from a capsized cruise liner. This time around, director Wolfgang Peterson uses computer imagery and special effects to tell the story. This is one movie that should have gone down with the ship.Peterson's Poseidon is chalk full of stunning visuals and impossible stunts. What were compromised were the script and the acting. It is sad to see such an exuberant amount of money wasted on such a poor effort in most areas of the film. The star studded cast featuring Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss, and rising star Emmy Rossum can't pull through the abysmal writing.The story opens on New Year's Eve aboard the luxury cruise ship Poseidon. Like the god of the sea that it is based on, Poseidon is anything but small. Aboard is the former mayor of New York City Robert Ramsey (Russell) and his daughter Jennifer along with her boyfriend. The man of mystery Dylan Johns (Lucas) meets Ramsey during a game of poker with ""Lucky Larry"" (Kevin Dillon). There is also the ever lonesome Richard Nelson (Dreyfuss) longing for his partner. The stage is set for an imminent catastrophe.After the boat rings in the New Year with a cameo appearance by Stacy Ferguson from The Black Eyed Peas, a rogue wave of mythic proportions hits the ship, causing it to roll over onto its ""screws"". Now it is a race to the top through water, fire, and unlucky passengers to find safety.As the band of heroes and heroines join forces, they are faced with a series of difficult escapes through lobbies, hallways, and air vents. The rising water and flash fires posing a problem every step of the way. The one question remains; is there going to be a way out?Surely, Peterson spent many long nights trying to make the capsizing of the boat look as realistic as can be and all the little thrills and spills of a disaster movie as entertaining as possible. The effects overshadow the film itself, at least until the cast opens their mouths. The word ""excellent"" should not be used while aiding someone through an elevator shaft. Perhaps if the script dealt more on the dialogue than the pointless and brief backgrounds, the movie could have worked. Poseidon didn't have to be made. Its sole purpose is to make money and entertain the people who are not aware of the original. As far as disaster movies go, this is just another special effects filled film with not enough of everything to suffice.",Poseidon
113,Flagrant-Baronessa,A 'Bad' movie can still be fun to watch,6,3 August 2006,"Especially one that sinks Titanic in special effects...This is a remake of The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Before you jump on the bandwagon and start bashing it on this basis alone, keep it mind that the original film was not exactly a masterpiece. It was a film that sacrificed scientific reality to propel an inane plot, filled with one-dimensional characters and compensated for it with action-overload. Poseidon is exactly the same -- ridiculous plot, intrepid characters and big slice of adventure. What is different in this version is the masterful CGI. This is a perfect time to remake a film like this (much better than in 1972) -- just go overboard with special effects and no one will notice the flawed writing (which is basically a sketchbook mess).This is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience. I'll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheeseball line (""Where is the disco?"" ""Why, you feel like dancing now?""), but I set its cringeworthy dialogue aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie. The giant tidal wave capsizing the luxury liner Poseidon would take care of that, leaving only a small group of people fighting to reach the top and get out. Another thing, besides special effects, that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Make no mistake however, these characters are still dumb to the core, getting by on lucky circumstances, occasional heroic feats and conveniently appearing objects and hatches  you've seen it all before, but damn, this is sensationally quality action.Overall, Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fast-paced as any action film you'll see. It features mind-numbing special effects, overdoses of excitement and just typical Wolfgang Peterson overkill. It definitely won't disappoint you if you're looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks. I'd even happily sit through this experience again.6.5/10",Poseidon
114,majikstl,This ship has sailed ... and sunk ...,2,14 May 2006,"In the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE, the venerable SS Poseidon was on its last voyage, even before it had a wave of bad luck. Headed to port to be turned to scrap, the aging luxury liner was comfortably aged and loaded down with a bunch of amiable B-list movie stars playing rather endearingly ordinary people. POSEIDON, the remake, is apparently far from being on its last leg; sparkling new and lavishly decorated in nondescript, tasteless elegance, it is carrying a passenger list of dubious VIPs, who don't even have enough dimension to be clichés and are played by actors, who, though competent, would barely even rate being on the B-list. But it does seem to have a healthy cargo of things that blow up. Indeed, it seems that more of the unfortunate victims of this seagoing disaster meet fiery deaths than watery ones -- explosions being far more photogenic than the inability to hold ones breath for very long.POSEIDON the new movie is very much like Poseidon the new ship: cold, efficient, impersonal and doomed to sink like a rock. The most remarkable thing about this SS Poseidon is that it has a huge bridge full of technicians and flashing electronic gizmos, yet the 150-foot tidal wave that flips the boat sneaks up on everyone without warning. Apparently the wave spotting equipment they use is from the same company that created iceberg detecting equipment for the Titanic. Indeed, the first person to spot the tidal wave is a passenger played by a strangely subdued Richard Dreyfuss, whose impromptu suicide attempt is rudely interrupted. The movie itself is pretty much an empty vessel, though it is certainly a product of its time. Trivial concerns such as story and character are jettisoned in favor of elaborate and expensive sets and CGI special effects. Indeed, the imagery of the new POSEIDON is most impressive and outshines the then-cutting edge productions values of the 1972 original. Yet, it isn't nearly as effective in any regard. The original film had its ragtag band of survivalists interacting with their topsy-turvy environment, where this time the stunts and sets and CGI simply overwhelm everything and everybody. Like so many CGI blockbusters, human interaction is merely a bothersome detail; the real focus being on the violent extermination of masses of nameless, faceless victims. And once again, Hollywood has mistaken technological gimmickry for storytelling skill. When the film does try to escape from tired predictability it bites off far more than it can chew. At one point a main character is compelled to kill another character in order to save himself, yet this intense and perverse moment early in the film is never dealt with again. The surviving character must neither redeem himself or face karmic punishment for his act. The secondary character is just killed and forgotten -- presumably because the character and the actor playing the part weren't important enough to care about. After that, it is hard to care about the fate of anyone else. The film has no sense of humanity, let alone a sense of humor about the absurdity of the entire premise.The cast, not unduly burdened with characters to play or chances to actually act, run the obstacle course with dogged professionalism. Kurt Russell is no Gene Hackman, but he is in the unfortunate position of being too good of an actor for this type of film, yet not big enough of a star to actually carry it. Young Jimmy Bennet is perfectly convincing as a terrified child and Josh Lucas has an impressive underbite perfectly suited for jutting out his chin in fierce determination. Other than that, the cast is unremarkable, sadly lacking even any Carol Lynleys or Pamela Sue Martins, let alone such wonderfully hammy pros like Roddy McDowall, Stella Stevens, Ernest Borgnine or the inimitable Shelley Winters. None of the characters/actors stand out enough to be sympathetic, endearing or even memorable. Indeed, the three female leads -- Jacinda Barrett, Emmy Rossum and Mía Maestro -- are so interchangeable that it is hard to tell their characters apart. I suppose that the filmmakers wanted this to be like the remake of KING KONG, an eye-popping, special effects reinvention of a well-worn story. But, instead, POSEIDON ends up being like the woefully unnecessary remake of PSYCHO: there was no need, demand or purpose for this film to exist and the filmmakers reveal they have no apparent clue as to why the original is loved in the first place. That's what happens when you set sail without a compass; you just get lost at sea.",Poseidon
115,Just-A-Girl-14,VERY under rated movie!,9,24 July 2020,"I can't understand the low ratings this movie has received!! I never saw the original film but as a disaster film it's a pretty great one! The cast is great and the CGI is excellent (it's 14 years old), it's fast paced and has lots of action right from the start. I see absolutely no reason why it received a 5.7 rating! It might not be a 9/10 for most people but I like it a lot and if you never watched it, I think you should give it a chance.As for the science behind the film, some reviewers mentioned a rogue wave can not flip a cruise ship like that but according to Wikipedia it can. It was actually really interesting to read about the phenomenon. It seems we don't know enough about it which only makes it more interesting.I really like survival/disaster movies and I actually prefer to watch movies that are more focused on a specific group of people trying to survive a certain event/situation than to watch end of the world movies.",Poseidon

The story and characters are different, which I liked because that meant it was like seeing a new story and not the old one over again.

117,charchuk,"Cheesy fun, nothing more",3,24 September 2006,"Pretty much the definition of a summer popcorn flick. No character development, barely any plot to speak of, just B-level actors going through increasingly implausible action scenes and an unbelievable amount of tight spots. The movie moves so quickly that you care for none of the characters, and you're pretty much just waiting for the end so you can see which ones survive and which ones die. Since there's absolutely no creativity present in this film, you can guess by the first five minutes which characters are gonna bite it by the end of the flick. The original was a lot more fun, as those characters were all quirky individuals with clashing personalities - these characters are all bland heroes, with no dimension at all. Definitely an inferior remake.The special effects, however hyped, didn't really impress me all that much, as the opening shot of the ship is so obviously CGI that it makes it look more like a video game than a movie. Some of the water effects are kinda cool, but nothing that hasn't been done before. The acting is uniformly bad, ranging from unbelievably annoying (that damn kid) to way over-the-top (Kurt Russell, especially his big death scene), and the story is chock full of plot holes, that just grow as the film progresses (I especially liked the conveniently placed life raft at the end). Still, there are some tense scenes, some funny moments (however unintentional, the death of Lucky Larry was freakin' hilarious), and some good action scenes, so it's not a complete waste. Just a bad cheesy movie.",Poseidon

Of course it was stupid. For a start, everything would have taken place in pitch darkness, so there would never have been a movie at all. And there were more flames and explosions than in Towering Inferno ---- all underwater. It was horrid seeing the Kurt Russell character drowning. It looked as if the director had studied what happens, because Russell's convulsions were luridly convincing. But within seconds we are laughing again because after he's drowned he has just one twitch left with which to push the right switch. All the business with the propellors at the climax was incomprehensible, and characters took horrific bangs that would have killed normal people === but like I say, it's a popcorner, and worth viewing in the right mood.",Poseidon
119,christian123,Some gripping scenes and effects can't quite overcome a weak script and dull characters,4,19 May 2006,"On New Year's Eve, the luxury cruise ship Poseidon is hit by an enormous wave that flips it upside-down stranding thousands of passengers underwater. A group of passengers join together to try to escape the ship.The original Poseidon was decent disaster film. It had engaging characters, decent special effects and a cheesy storyline. The remake is more or less the same minus the interesting characters, charm and suspense. Okay, the remake did have a few suspenseful scenes though nothing very memorable or original. The reason why the film wasn't very suspenseful was because the characters were all one dimensional and dull. There was no character development at all so it was hard to care for these people. While watching the movie, it's just easier to refer to them as generic titles like ""the old guy"" or something. Actually, if you use this method then you can probably figure out who will die and in what order they will die.The acting is very weak and unconvincing. Josh Lucas is an okay actor but he wasn't very good here. He just didn't make a good hero nor was his character very likable. Kurt Russell was okay, nothing special. Emmy Rossum was terrible as Jennifer. Her performance felt so forced and over the top. The way she expressed her emotions just looked so fake and unconvincing. Jimmy Bennett was just annoying as Conor. Richard Dreyfuss was very misused and his character seemed out of place. Jacinda Barrett gives a laughable performance, it was just very poor. I should warn you (or comfort you?) that Stacy Ferguson from the Black Eyed peas is only in the movie for about 10 minutes, maybe a little less.When judged as a disaster film, Poseidon is actually pretty decent. The special effects were great though 160 million was obviously just a bit too much. Wolfgang Petersen is really good at making a film appear stylish including the ship which looked amazing. His storytelling skills aren't as good though. The combination of a weak script didn't help matters either. The movie was just too corny at times for my taste. For example, there was once scene where Josh Lucas was planning to escape the ballroom and one by one, the rest of the characters just come up and ask to come along. It was just a bit too obvious and they should have handled it differently. I also thought it was kind of dumb that all the characters were able to hold their breath underwater for large amounts of time. Despite these flaws, there were a few engaging scenes and some touching moments. Also, the movie is pretty short so it's not really too much of a pain to sit through. This helped the experience a little though I wouldn't have minded a longer movie. In the end, Poseidon may not be worth checking out in theaters but it should make for a decent rental. Rating 6/10",Poseidon
120,theshadow908,Realistic and intense but...Something's missing.,6,19 May 2006,"Poseidon is a remake of the superior 70's classic The Poseidon Adventure. In this film, a cruise ship is capsized by a rogue wave and there are only a handful of survivors. One in particular decides to make his way up to the bottom of the ship to escape, figuring it's the best chance. He is joined by a former firefighter, his daughter and her fiancé, a suicidal architect, a mother and her son, and a frightened stowaway. Together they work as a team to fight against time for survival. While the plot of this movie is pretty good and it is more realistic than the original, the lack of interesting characters hurts the movie.The acting in this movie is pretty good. A lot of people will tell you that the acting sucks, but it's not true. There are very talented actors in this movie like Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas. They all do very good jobs in their roles. Josh Lucas plays the part of a man who'd rather work alone but ultimately takes charge of saving these peoples lives, and he plays the part well. The only acting I really have a problem with is Andre Braugher as the Captain who says one too many corny lines and delivers them with TV movie acting quality. However, his role isn't overly important, so it's not a problem.The action and the way the movie is filmed is far more realistic than the original. In this movie, the water is one step behind them all the time, and the number of times they almost drown is amazing. This movie is claustrophobic and gives you chills because of the situation they're in. It really makes you happy you're sitting in a theatre instead of being involved in the action. One of the problems though is that everybody on the ship seems to be able to hold their breath for five minutes and is a professional swimmer. It requires a bit of suspension of disbelief to view how they get out of tight spaces. A scene that comes to mind is where the 10 year old kid rescues everyone from drowning by unscrewing a vent at the last second, and another where the kid is drowning, and Josh Lucas rescues him with no explanation as to how he did it. What I mean by it's more realistic is that everybody is out for themselves and they don't waste time talking. They want to go go go! The biggest problem with the film is that it's too short. I truly believe this movie would have been way better if there was a half hour extra at the beginning to allow for more character development. One thing that made the original so good was that we could sympathize and connect with the characters because we felt like we knew them. In this film, by the end I was only able to name one or two facts about each character. We aren't given enough time to get to know/like the characters. For instance, Kurt Russell's character. He steps up at one part and says, ""I used to be a fireman!"" and his daughter says, ""He used to be the mayor of New York."" That's about all we get to know about his character.Overall, this is an intense, claustrophobic action film that truly entertains in some scenes, but the lack of likable characters and character development in general takes away from the quality.6.5/10",Poseidon

This one I was really loathe to see....and with good reason.The movie is about a bunch of people trapped on a cruise boat that gets hit by a rogue wave and overturns. Most die, but a group of people forge a desperate escape mission. Basically we follow them for an hour, generally narrowly escaping one flood to another, losing a few characters we've formed no attachment to along the way. Just awful.Besides the terrible script, we're left saddened by the fact Kurt Russell is the 2nd billed actor and that Fergie from ""Black Eye Peas"" makes a cameo.

123,mOVIemAN56,Not terrible just not much there,5,5 March 2007,"I managed to catch Poseidon after months of putting it off or missing it. I wasn't expecting much but did get a little more than I expected. Poseidon was a big budget action/thriller/adventure film that I didn't expect to amount to much, especially after the boring dialogue of the first half hour. However Poseidon proved to be a little more than senseless dialogue and chaos. Poseidon cast a different message and meaning to me.After a whole ship capsizes a few people must try and find their way to the top of it as the ship slowly implodes and sinks. Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) try to lead the few survivors to safety through a seemingly endless maze of steel, water, and bodies. They go up against everything imaginable during a capsizing and it is a question of who will survive this adventure to the top of the Poseidon. Kurt Russell has managed to stay strong as a leading character even while he is aging. His performance as Robert is a very convincing performance. He doesn't say much in the movie but his words that are spoken truly grab hold of the viewer. His calm physique and stone face look draws a person right in and doesn't let them go as the chaos goes on around them. I couldn't see anyone else as the lead in this film.Josh Lucas proves once again that he has some talent in his bones. The way he is able to express earnestness, fear, ingenuity is marvelous in the film. His performance is even better than Kurt Russells and really does steal the show. His performance is what made me give the film higher markings then it should have.The special effects are wonderful. The sinking of the ship is sort of a mix between Titanic and The Perfect Storm done beautifully with the near silence that accompanies it. I really liked how the film makers built up the wave. Silence, silence, silence, chaos. Very well done in the CGI department. Deserved the Oscar nomination it got and deserved to win over the Pirates film.The script is a bit bland. After the capsizing there is not much dialogue or character development. The story between Robert, his daughter, and her boyfriend never really develops nor does the story of the silent and depressed Nelson played wonderfully by the near forgotten Richard Dreyfuss. The story could have used a little less flash and a little more depth to it.The scenes of near escapes are breath taking and will have you gripping onto you seat wondering what will happen next. The film is not terrible but it is more as what Dylan said about the capsizing, ""A flash fire."" Good at one point, burned away at the next. If you are a sucker for great CGI but little story besides escape, then Poseidon is just for you.2.5/5 Stars",Poseidon

125,henrycoles9,First movie I saw in a theater ever,10,25 January 2021,Looking back now I remember how excited I was at this movie as a kid. The visual effects were so good and the cast were stellar like all 2000s movies.,Poseidon
126,mnpollio,Neither as bad as critics would have you believe nor worthy of a full ticket price,4,30 January 2007,"In an age of remake mania, it is not hard to see what would draw one towards remaking the early 1970s disaster epic The Poseidon Adventure. The then-landmark visual effects seem quaint and vaguely cheesy in the here-and-now, but the story is relatively sturdy. An ocean liner is capsized by a 100-foot rogue wave and a band of plucky survivors struggle to make their way to the bottom (now top) of the ship in order to facilitate rescue. Wolfgang Petersen's remake is neither as bad as critics would have you believe nor worthy of anything more than a brief look on cable. Petersen opens the story scant moments before the gigantic wave hits, so we know little about the hopeful survivors/dead meat characters and we learn little more about them as the film proceeds. The film has a short running time and is rarely boring, but neither is it especially suspenseful, which is a bit surprising when one remembers that Petersen is responsible for the virtuoso Das Boot. Much of the problem becomes clear. Even with aged effects, part of the original film's charm was in watching the histrionics of its all-star cast  particularly who was overacting the most. The original cast was an eclectic bunch and one was never quite certain who would make it through to the end. The remake provides us with a solid, dependable but largely unenthralling barely-B-movie cast. No one embarrasses themselves, but there is nothing meaty for them to sink their teeth into. And with one exception (I was certain Mike Vogel's sweet hunky boyfriend was a goner), it is easy to pick out the dead meat characters. Once again, there is a young boy (even more annoying than the know-it-all from the original) and he is saddled with a comely mother, who gets to make goo-goo eyes at co-lead Josh Lucas and humanize his roguish gambler. The film's biggest attempt at character development (and biggest misfire) provides us with Richard Dreyfuss as a gay architect who was contemplating suicide over a break-up with his partner a few moments before the wave hits and he does an about-face. So much so that in a short period he literally kicks a good-natured waiter in the face (at Lucas' insistence) sending him to his undeserved death so he can save his own skin. A move which leaves an incredibly bad taste and puts one off the character for the duration of the film, especially since he has nothing to contribute. Kevin Dillon makes a brief insufferable appearance as a drunk named Lucky Larry (oh the irony!). Kurt Russell is likable (so for that matter are Vogel and Freddy Rodriguez), but the women are all physically the same (young, beautiful and ineffectual) and there is no break-out star like Shelley Winters in her acclaimed role as the swimming champion yenta from the original. The visual effects with the wave are incredible, but brief and hardly worth an admission price. The only reason to remake the film was to keep the same ingredients, but amp up the effects. Petersen has amped up the effects, but scaled down everything else and it shows.",Poseidon
127,raisleygordon,"Good Movie, But It Could Have Been More",7,30 July 2010,"I own this movie on DVD simply because I enjoyed it on the big screen. It's got decent special effects, and an ideal cast, but why isn't there more at stake than just people's lives? Why is there no villain? Well, there is, but he's not all that mean, and is killed off too early during the ship's sinking. Might as well get rid of him before the tidal wave. The movie is about people merely fighting for their lives. Why turn a ship upside down, if all you're gonna see is people looking for an exit? Aside from the villain, why not have a few characters die trying to save themselves, or have the ship itself go into even further peril? But mostly it's just watching these characters swimming, gasping for air, and trying to remove obstacles in their path. My fondness for the movie has more to do with special effects and acting than the story.*** out of ****",Poseidon
128,curtis-8,Not Sure Why It's Not Better Than Original,6,21 April 2009,"I haven't figuered it out yet, but I just know that I didn't enjoy this remake nearly as much as I enjoyed the original seventies film. This version has better acting overall (if not better actors) and of course the effects are much better today than they were in '72. And the director is great. Also the original was corny and the characters more broadly drawn, etc.But...I still get into the old one when I see it. And this one just didn't grab me. I think it might be because the new version doesn't spend enough time with the characters before the action starts, and then when the action starts, it doesn't stop. It's just one fast-paced action sequence escape to the next with the characters all screaming and freaking out. It was annoying, not scary, mainly 'cos I just didn' give a damn about any of the folks involved. I mean, even cardboard characters with corny dialog beats out characters with no character just screaming.But it's even more than that. Even with the greatly improved special effects, I just didn't get that whole ""upside down boat"" feeling in the new version. It was more like a video game with the characters moving from one level to the next as they flooded. No sense of how unusual the situation was, or anything. People were just like ""hey, boats upside down, let's go!"" They didn't even argue about whether that was a good idea or not. I guess they'd all seen the original and just knew what was up, so to speak.Anyway, maybe I'll figure it out and post again later, but for now I'll just say this: The new Poseidion bored the hell out of me, while the older, supposedly out of date one, still rocks me.",Poseidon
129,ExpendableMan,Another remake misfires,4,13 December 2006,"It all starts off so well too. The opening shot of Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon is beautiful. A single take that begins beneath the surface of the ocean that swings up and out of it as the underside of the ship slices through the waves, before pivoting round the colossal cruise liner and zeroing in on Josh Lucas running on the deck. With the sun setting in the distance and the immense size of the vessel itself contrasted with the deep blue of the water, this is a visually astounding entrance to a movie that is unfortunately very shallow indeed.A remake of the classic disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure, this tells much the same story with a small group of passengers trying to escape a doomed ocean liner after it capsizes due to a freak wave. Given the beloved status of the original, besting it was going to be tricky from the start so how to do it? Bestow the characters with as much depth and humanity as possible, arrange it so that you don't want any of them to die just as the original film did? No. That isn't the 21st Century Studio Approach to blockbusters at all, the trick is explosions! Lots of explosions! And dangerous stunts that happen in very quick succession with no set up whatsoever.As a result, things happen very quickly. We've hardly got to know anyone on the ship before the wave strikes and sends their world tumbling upside down in a hail of glass and debris. Trapped beneath the waves, there is no debate on the best means of survival but instead a bull headed rush to escape as soon as possible and before you know it, barely any time has elapsed before we have our luckless nobodies dangling from lift shafts, diving through burning oil slicks or scrambling up air vents rapidly filling with water. This could all be very entertaining if it wasn't so empty and if only they'd eased back on the throttle a little bit, we could have had a much more successful film.Kurt Russell for instance is wasted. As an ex firefighter and former Mayor of New York with a failed marriage behind him, they could have crafted the image of a troubled man going through a midlife crisis who finds himself tested beyond his limits. Instead, the only hints at any characterisation are him protesting his daughter's cleavage bearing dress to leave no doubt that theirs is a strained relationship. Then there is Richard Dreyfuss (who has finally found a bigger boat), whose character might as well be listed in the credits as ""depressed, elderly gay man."" Everyone else is just as vacuous and while Josh Lucas is certainly a charismatic focal point, it cannot make up for the two dimensional stereotypes of Kevin Dillon's gambler Lucky Larry or Mike Vogel's performance as Christian, the fiancée of Russell's daughter who manages to put in perhaps the worst attempt at acting you will see in a blockbuster this year.It does have a few commendable points though. One death scene involving a lift shaft, jagged metal spikes and an explosion is an adrenaline pumping crowd pleaser and the aforementioned scramble through the flooding ventilation shaft is really quite tense, the ensemble cast squeezed together in a claustrophobic nightmare as the water bubbles up around them. Ultimately though, it is not enough to save it. Poseidon may make for a diverting hour and a half but Hollywood needs to learn a valuable lesson about plotting: bigger explosions and insane stunts are nowhere near as impressive if we don't care about the people involved. The original version made an entire generation terrified of getting on a boat with Ernest Borgnine, this is just laughable.",Poseidon

The drama start, and you pray for the dead of some of them. Mia Maestro is terrible, the only one with faith, but her character is terrible.

Well, the characterization may have been really little, but the movie takes place over one night, what do you want?

Or 'ELENA IS A STOWAWAY WHO WANTS TO REACH HER YOUNGER BROTHER IN NY'? Because that's what so-called 'character development' scenes do in disaster movies (see 'Poseidon Adventure, The (1972)' for shiny examples of that) and neither I nor Elena (hint hint, you've got to see the movie to understand) like it. The only question I have is: how the hell did Connor get where he was in one of the last scenes, since the only entrance to where he was was stuck? For the rest, great movie.

132,bababear,A Ripping Yarn,8,28 May 2006,"POSEIDON isn't so much a remake of the 1970's film as it is a re-imagining. The situation is the same, but there's a completely new cast of characters.This is a nice old fashioned ""movie movie"" in that it has no pretensions of being high art or deep drama. The characters are very- actually, too- quickly introduced and then the game is afoot.The special effects are amazing. I was so caught up in what was happening that I never thought in terms of wondering how an effect is done. In addition to the digital work, there are also over sixty stunt performers listed and they are to be commended for their work.Since the ship has the latest in radar and communication devices I do find it unlikely that the crew would be caught so much by surprise, but if they weren't it would be a twenty minute long movie on atom.com and not a feature film.In the first film we only saw the ship's inversion in the ballroom. Here we see a wave sweep a large group of people out of the swimming pool, characters in the disco, people in elevators (a poor location in this situation) and several scenes in work areas of the ship.There's no Christmas tree. Darn it. The little group of would-be survivors has to use other means to get away from the water.Despite the gifted actors working in front of the camera, the water is the real star of the movie. Now, even though we aren't too clear where they are we know they are headed for New York, so I can't help think that the water would be closer to about twenty degrees. But this isn't real life, it's a movie movie. And I'd love to know how people get a cell phone signal out there in the middle of the ocean when I lose mine a few blocks past the city limits sign.Unlike the first film, there won't be a sequel to this one. There was a little seen movie called BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE that took place literally minutes after the end of the first story. It starred Michael Caine and Sally Field, neither of whom are quick discuss it in interviews today.After the wave hits, the movie moves pretty much in real time. The characters move from location to location and if there's a lapse of time involved, I don't know when it was.There are numerous scenes of people swimming through flooded corridors and ductwork. People tell me these are quite effectively done. Since I'm claustrophobic as the day is long I had my eyes tightly closed, so I'll never know.This and the original movie both share what I consider to be a fault in adapting the novel. In the novel the people who went through hell on earth to climb through the guts of the ship were not the only ones rescued. There were other people who, through essentially dumb luck, got to see the sunrise, too.One of the characters in this one makes the statement that there's no fairness in situations like this. Because somebody's a good person doesn't guarantee their survival. Life isn't fair. And that's the truth.",Poseidon

You already know who will die and not and really do not even care anymore. I still remember the scene from the original Poseidon with Shelley Winters and how strong and powerful watching her save lives. Here, you do not care.Another item, CGI was definitely tacked on afterwards and it shows. While they had built a literal set and it looked good, they interpersed with CGI that was equivalent to what I can do with my PC.

This is the kind of movie where the script seems written in a notepad where various specifics are to be followed. It has to introduce a bunch of characters who we know some of which are going to die eventually, yet in the end, we don't really care.A luxury liner named ""Poseidon"" is on a cruise one New Year's Eve when a rogue wave has capsized the ship. A group of survivors who never seem to tire despite having to run, hang around protruding chunks of metal, and battle tremendous water pressure, are trying to figure a way out before the ship sinks. So we meet Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), the charismatic ""leader"" of the group who originally set to escape alone but later has to tug along with him a number of people; Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), the father of Jennifer (Emily Rossum) who is engaged to Christian (Mike Vogel) despite the reluctance of her father to their relationship; Maggie (Jacinda Barrett), a single mother and her nine-year old son Conor (Jimmy Bennett); Richard (Richard Dreyfuss), a man with serious issues on suicide; Elena (Mia Maestro), a religious stowaway; Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon), the one who cares so much about his liquor even in the face of a disaster; and Marco (Freddy Rodriguez), a waiter serving as a ""map."" Obviously, it is a movie with nothing but plot devices sprinkled all over in an attempt to showcase the special effects with a siding of hokey emotional moments among the survivors, which just don't work. Granted, the special effects were good, but with a minimal plot and cardboard-cut characters to back it up, the excitement just sort of slips away like water in your hands. Neither does it help that a huge chunk of the movie is filled with cheesy dialog from scriptwriter Mark Protosevich. The acting is mostly serviceable, even from Lucas (who was in ""Glory Road"") and Rossum (who was in ""The Day After Tomorrow""). As for Petersen, although it's clear he's at home with large-scale movies, he fails to give this latest project a touch of ""epic-ness"" to it.""Poseidon"" fails on so many levels and there aren't even enough laughs (intentional or otherwise) to provide the ""so bad it's good"" feeling.

135,gregeichelberger,'Poseidon' capsizes and sinks in a storm of unbridled stupidity,2,31 July 2012,"Originally published on May 9, 2006.Although this fits firmly into the ""It Could Have Been Worse"" dept., one has to wonder if Hollywood has completely run out of original ideas, or if re-working old classics has become a cottage industry to lazy scriptwriters in these dark times.And while it's probably not very objective of me, I could not help comparing the newest Warner Bros. release, ""Poseiden,"" with its predecessor, 1972's ""The Poseiden Adventure."" This comparison occurred before, during and long after I viewed the screening of the $160 million revision. And, needless to say, the side-by-side examinations were not favorable to the latter version.First of all (and I fully realize most people out there under 20 – the core group this film is aimed at – have never heard of, let alone seen, the original film), let's talk about the cast.In 1972, despite a somewhat goofy script, we still had Academy Award winners Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and Jack Albertson in leading roles. Even four-time Oscar nominee Arthur O'Connell had a cameo role, Leslie Neilson (before he discovered comedy) was the ship's captain, and Carol Lindley, Roddy MacDowell, Stella Stevens and Eric Shea (the little kid who was the voice of Linus in the early ""Peanuts"" cartoons) rounded out the competent ensemble.That movie even had the Grammy-winning, No. 1 single, ""Morning After"" as its theme song. Today, we have Oscar winner (for 1977's ""The Goodbye Girl"") Richard Dreyfess, as a gay architect; Kurt Russell, as a former fireman and Mayor of New York (what?!); Josh Lucas (fresh off his one-note performance in ""Glory Road"" as a Navy veteran who seemingly knows everything about luxury liners); Emmy Rossum (""Phantom of the Opera""), as Russell's promiscuous daughter, Jennifer; her empty-headed boyfriend, Christian (Mike Vogel, ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants""); and Jacinda Barrett (""Bridget Jones: On The Edge Of Reason""), as single mom, Maggie James, towing her annoying offspring, Conner (Jimmy Bennett) along with her. You don't have to be Neptune to see this latest group just does not match up.After a ""rogue"" wave capsizes the ship just after New Year's Eve, this group disobeys the captain (Andre Braugher) and heads down, I mean up, to find an escape route through the propeller shaft.Okay, here's another problem I had with this version. In the original, we are told of an earthquake off the coast of Greece, which caused a tsunami. The crew was alerted to be on the lookout for a possible huge wave (although the curling action we see in both movies is physically wrong for a wave in the middle of the sea). It appears on the ship's radar, and though the passengers know nothing of it, we feel the tension of seeing the huge wall of water engulf the vessel.Here, there is no tension because the wave appears out of nowhere (I suppose that's why they call it ""rogue,"" but still ...). All of the same effects are in effect when the boat tumbles over - people and objects being thrown about, guys falling into skylights, water flooding various compartments, fire and explosions under water (don't ask), and various extras being crushed, drowned and/or roasted like peanuts. The one interesting scene is when the wave hits, there are a group of people washed out of the top deck's swimming pool.Like the '72 picture, the gang is plagued with many obstacles, a few interesting twists, some really claustrophobic and lung-aching moments (as much of their time is seemingly spent underwater), while a few of their number is quickly reduced by death. And there are certainly many more gruesome demises than in the first picture, to be sure. Plus, the FX are newer, although not necessarily better. Another thing that bothered me was the complete lack of character development. We're told that Lucas is a veteran (who works better alone), and that Russell was a firefighter (who thinks his daughter is too young for sex), but that's about it. Then there's Dreyfus' character calling his lover and crying, getting no message back and tossing his cell phone overboard. No explanation necessary from director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") about this whole storyline, I guess. Or the scene where Dreyfus is ordering a $5,000 bottle of wine for his dinner guests and mumbling about the ""war scare"" being over. What was he talking about?! Then there's the completely unnecessary inclusion of a drunk, male chauvinist Kevin ""Platoon"" Dillion, whose death is right of the ""Ha ha, he got what's coming to him,"" notebook.The sequence where the little boy is suddenly washed under some kind of wire enclosure also boggles the mind, since we know nothing of how he gets there, or how he is ultimately saved. It just happens. And, of course, as soon as the captain convinces everyone to stay where they are, we know that's the death knell for these unfortunate dopes.Besides the updated special effects, however, there is really no reason to see this one as long as the original still exists, so why bother? Just rent or buy the '72 version and get ready for some hokey lines, but an overall much better adventure than this sterile film can offer.Thus, the entire re-made enterprise capsizes and sinks in a storm of unbridled stupidity and incompetence.",Poseidon
136,rparham,Poseidon lightweight fun,6,1 June 2006,"Long live Irwin Allen! Even years after his death, the disaster movie formula he popularized in the 1970s occasionally finds life breathed into it every so often, and this is once again the case with the 2006 remake of Poseidon, based on the Allen produced 1972 film The Poseidon Adventure. For anyone entering the theater with the thought or hope that Poseidon will radically improve the disaster movie genre, you can check your unrealistic expectations at the door: Poseidon is a disaster movie in the standard mold, through and through. However, that doesn't mean it isn't effective at what it does, provide an entertaining two hours at the movies.The disaster movie formula is completely old-hat by this point, so most people know the ropes: Introduction of object or situation that will lead to disaster (in this case the over-sized ocean liner Poseidon), a brief run-through of some stock characters, the big disaster, here a giant ""rogue wave"" that topples the Poseidon, and finally the characters' attempt to escape their dire circumstances in which many of them meet untimely and often unpleasant fates.The characters in question are loner gambler Dylan (Josh Lucas, proving once again that he must have a deal in place in his contracts to be required to carry a few days of beard growth every so many movies), former NYC mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancé Christian (Mike Vogel), gay depressed architect Richard (Richard Dreyfuss), single mom Maggie (Jacinda Barrett) and her son Conor (Jimmy Bennett), crew hand Valentin (Freddie Rodriguez), stowaway Elena (Mia Maestro) and chauvinist gambler Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon). The group of them leave the grand ballroom against the will of the ship's Captain (Andre Braugher, woefully misused in this small role) after the boat capsizes from the wave with the intention of reaching the top of the ship, and freedom. The Captain believes they would be better off staying put in the ballroom behind watertight bulkhead doors, but what fun would that movie be? So, as our intrepid survivors make their way through the ship, they come face to face with multiple occasions of drowning, explosions and raging fires, and uncooperative doors and corridors.Poseidon is for the most part a plot on auto-pilot, nothing happens that is outside of the realm of the expected if you have seen a disaster movie or two. While the individual challenges faced by the characters may not always be predictable, the basic thrust of the film is, so a certain amount of suspense is negated by that realization. However, when the various moments of disaster occur, director Wolfgang Peterson does an admirable job of generating tension when appropriate. You know characters are going to die, but not every one of the deaths is obvious (although at least one character, who will not be revealed by me, might as well have a big bullseye painted on him).Visually, Poseidon is spectacular at times. The film opens with a gorgeous looking 360 degree helicopter shot that moves around the Poseidon, and the scenes where the wave hits the ship are impressive. Most of the other effects are of the more physical variety, fires, water, etc., but they are well executed. On the character front, no one is really developed beyond what is absolutely needed to move the screenplay forward, so everyone remains a basically two-dimensional type, with no depth to them. However, to do more would almost weight Poseidon's running time down, and this is a film that does not overstay it's welcome in the slightest, so some rather uninvolving characters are almost a blessing (which you can't say about most movies).Poseidon is almost the definition of lightweight summer entertainment: looks good, moves fast, doesn't require much thought. Every so often, when looking for escapist fare on a weekend evening, that isn't such a bad thing.",Poseidon

138,kooleshwar,As good a disaster based movie as any!!!! (havent seen the original),8,15 May 2006,"Before you read any further:-Although I have heard of the original I haven't seen it thus I have the privilege of reviewing this movie as an original hence I am unable to make comparisons with the original movie.I went into this movie expecting slow dragging start and an absolute roller-coaster at the end but BOY WAS I Surprised.The action starts within 10 minutes or less and never ever lets up. This movie leaves you tensed and gripped throughout and gives you no time to recover from the shock almost like the protagonist themselves.The special effects and sets are absolutely mind boggling and as person who demolishes ships i can tell you save for a few minor glitches which maybe only I (being a professional Ship Demolisher) or a Naval Engineer can notice.I can go as far as saying that if you neglect the historical value that the sets of the titanic had the grandeur and scale of the sets of this movie are far superior to that movie.The acting is good however the character development is weak despite that fact that this is a 99 min movie and there is actually not much time to develop characters.However a few glaring deficiencies were apparent especially concerning Richard Dreyfuss who had a unexplained and unreasonable drive to live. And Josh Lucas who had unreasonably charitable personality.Other than this (given the short length of the movie) the acting and characterization was as good as can be . Special mention for Kurt Russel who does every role he receives with great conviction and Emmy Rossum who looked gorgeous in this movie.There is however one very very big plot hole and technical mistake that the makers of this film have made and i have duly submitted it in the goofs section. The hole is at absolutely the end and it somehow dampened the thrill of this otherwise thrill a minute ride.The destruction of the ship was brilliant but has me questioning the fact that the graphic depiction of death gets a PG-13 rating but other movies which are less graphic but involve physical actions straight away get a A Rating.The movie is slightly predictable however there are a few surprises on how, when and who dies.Yes this movie may not have the drama (and the boredom associated with it) and may not be Oscar material but its a simple fun film which is not to be taken seriously and can be enjoyed with everybody. If you are the drama and meaningful cinema loving type of person this film is not for you.Technically (film wise) sound and extremely fast paced with a liberal dose of tense moments and special effects this is a movie you have to see.",Poseidon
139,son_of_cheese_messiah,Survival of the selfish,4,17 August 2009,"This remake of the Poseidon Adventure is not as contemptible as some remakes have been (ie Planet of the apes), but not surprisingly is worse than the original, perhaps my favourite 70s disaster movie. The characters are more superficial and less varied; there's no one to represent the overweight or elderly, which I guess is modern Hollywood's values: only the young and beautiful deserve to survive.The characters are a loose bunch of wealthy (and white) narcissists which again reflects modern society I guess. The main characters are seen before the crash gambling inordinate amounts of cash, the sort that normal people would not see in their lifetime. This selfish and privileged group are the only people allowed to escape and it speaks volumes for the mentality of Hollywood that they imagine we will be rooting for them. I guess more than one person would hope they'd all drown and we'd see a few crew members get out instead.Kurt Russell is an ex-fireman who became the major of New York . This might have been interesting if developed, but, as so much here, it is just mentioned to give the character a gravitas he would not otherwise possess. There is precious little of his rescue or leadership skills on display. Despite the wave having killed apparently everyone else on board, Russell's boring daughter and her boring boyfriend survive miraculously elsewhere: these two have no personalities but Hollywood imagines we are routing for them. Apart from this 'family', everyone else is looking after number one.Richard Dreyfuss is gay and suicidal which is enough to make him 'interesting' to the film makers: that he deliberately sends a man to his death is never again mentioned. That man, a Latino cabin boy is the only non-Caucasian, working class person they allow to come with them. When this nondescript and token character appears out of nowhere and is offered twice his yearly salary to help them, you know he'll have sticky end (I guess having dark skin here is the equivalent of a red shirt in Star Trek), but I was surprised with the savage nature of his death. He heroically offers to let Dreyfuss go before him and is rewarded by being unceremoniously kicked to this doom. No sympathy is shown to him.So the message is: don't help anyone.Josh Lucas is another self-serving playboy who later converts to a messianic figure for no apparent reason. So he goes from looking after number one to a Mussolini-like leader. Another forgettable couple of well-heeled, fit and young characters are shoe-horned in. And there's a kid.The characterisation is not helped by the dialogue, some of the most excruciating I've ever heard.This film is both more PC than the original but also more narrow and racist. On the original, there were no black characters at all as far as I remember, which made the issue of race unimportant. Here we have a black captain, black passengers but no black survivors. Surely the film makers were aware of this? The characters in the original represented a wider range of humanity than this pampered lot. Despite being led by Gene Hackman, they were each to make a contribution, most notably Shelley Winter's overweight swimmer who saves Hackman. There's nothing like that here. This cast are simply led by a superman to salvation.The sequence in which the characters are killed are: non whites first, then the Christian, then anyone over a certain age. This film could almost be a propaganda film from Nazi Germany.This, however, must be judged as an adventure story, and on that level it works well enough. Special effects and CGI have advanced dramatically since the 70s. Like so many modern blockbusters, the effects are spectacular. What a pity the same effort was not applied to the script.",Poseidon

You knew before you saw the film what the set-up would be, and the film turns the boat over very early in the film. There was no need for a terrorism subplot, or a sea rescue subplot (both of which were added to the bloated TV remake).

144,freaky_dave,"No way is it great, but it was entertaining in its own way",6,12 May 2006,"Poseidon is the remake of the 1972 movie Poseidon Adventure. It was enjoyable and fun to watch to see who is going to live and who is going to die, but it has little else.On New Years Eve during a celebration, a very large rogue wave capsizes a luxury liner called the Poseidon, flipping it upside down in the water. After everything happens and some people die, the captain of the ship tries to stop everybody from panicking by saying that they will be safe here because the ballroom where they're all at will protect them from any fires. He also tells them that the ballroom (I guess that's what it was) acts as an air bubble which will stop the ocean from drowning them. Of course a small group of people decide that they will be safer by heading up towards the propellers which will lead to the surface and outside to safety, and so the adventure begins. Of course the audience knows that there will be obstacles along the way. Some of the characters will die, but if you saw the original you know this.The acting in the film is not bad at all, of course the dialogue could've been better. We have Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Jacinda Barrett, and Richard Dreyfuss and a bunch of others. Who lives and who dies is one of the reasons to watch the film as well as see what our heroes are made of as they fight there way through several fires and swim under water for very long periods of time. There is little else to see because none of the characters is ever completely developed.The special effects were very good. The way that waves moves in on the Poseidon and blocks out the moon just before it slams into the cruise ship is intense. Even the fires and the water which has flooded everything is scary. And it doesn't look like many stunt doubles were used for the action sequences as our heroes make their way.All though the films has a a lot of good things, it has some other things that aren't so good. Except for how the characters survive and find there way up, there really is no story. The actors, who are all good, are never given enough to work with. So Poseidon works as just a simple entertainment, nothing more and nothing less.Poseidon, in my opinion, is just a simple popcorn movie.

146,huh_oh_i_c,Poseidon AKA 'Only the lily-WHITE squares survive,1,10 August 2006,"Maybe spoilers ahead, but everyone has been saying this so it's iffy This movie is really offensive, it's hard to believe that sympathetic actors like Russell and Rossum participated in this, because: All the non-white characters are killed off! Plus the GAY guy is suicidal! What's that, because he's gay, he's so unstable that he gets all suicidal because of a broken heart? What kinda moral is that? White supremacy? Be straight or die? What!? What!? I don't wanna start some kind of German bashing here, but could there be any significance to the fact that the director is German? We have to see his major work, Das Boot, in a whole new light now: That movie is about glorification and victimization of Germans in WAR time. While I originally thought this painted a sympathetic picture of Germans caught up in a war they didn't want, now, with this whites-only movie, I'm beginning to doubt it.This movie is part of an ever growing and sickening trend, that of bleaching the major Hollywood productions. In recent years we saw SNOW-colored productions such as Friends, Roswell, One Tree Hill, Dawson's Creek, and to top it off, the new Battlestar Galactica, which had the gall to replace not ONE but TWO black characters with lily-white actors (Boomer AND Col. Thigh) Now, these were side kicks, so if they were replaced by ONE major black character ... but no. It can't be a coincidence that all these aforementioned movies, especially Poseidon and Battlestar have such shoddy and superficial writing, ridiculous Cartoon-Network-like graphics and diminishing popularity. Even Josh Lucas has said to the BBC that the characters' spoken lines are not necessary. That's got to be the epitome of sadness, when one of your own main characters says that his lines are superfluous.The only exception to this, the ONLY movie that dared to be different was ""Deep Blue Sea"", where there are 3 remaining characters, a white guy, his love interest the pretty young white girl and the black cook. Now, at the end, not the black guy is done for but the white chick! I was totally surprised about that one!

150,Benjamin_Cox,"A disappointing, pointless remake - 39%",3,5 January 2009,"Personally, I don't think TV has been kind during this festive period. Most of the decent movies I had already seen and the rest was utter dross. But never one to write off a movie before I'd seen it, I found myself watching this with my Better Half as we relaxed on holiday in Glasgow with her family. I admit, it wasn't high on my Wish List of films to see but I gave it a chance all the same. But dear Lord, was I disappointed! Flooded with as much CG as it is plot holes, suspect acting and water, this could have been any one of a number of disaster movies of the last decade - ""Godzilla"", ""Day After Tomorrow"", ""Volcano"" and so on. But what makes this stand out as a turkey, for me, is that it quickly degenerates into the most predictable struggle-against-the-odds drama where you have more fun guessing who lives and dies by the time the end credits roll.During a lavish New Years Eve party, the luxury ocean liner Poseidon is struck by a rogue wave that causes the vessel to flip over. Amid the chaos, a small group of survivors are faced with a stark choice - they can either stay put with the rest of the revellers in the ballroom or take a chance to find a path up through the bowels of the ship and seek safety on the upturned hull on the surface. Led by professional gambler Dylan (Josh Lucas) and former mayor of New York Robert Ramsay (Kurt Russell), a desperate group of survivors struggle against the odds to escape the rapidly sinking ship.I can only assume that director Wolfgang Petersen thought the script was an unnecessary expenditure with the CG mayhem telling its own story. And it does - the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes with little to make any of them appealing (Kevin Dillion's Lucky Larry is the most fundamentally unlikeable character I can recall seeing in any movie) and each scene clearly presents a possible horrific death, meaning the only reason you watch is to see who gets it. Nothing surprises and entertains you though you have to give the cast credit for coping with being repeatedly doused with water. Sadly, none of them really acquit themselves well as far as performance goes. Russell does what he can with the script and is probably the best of the lot but Richard Dreyfuss is criminally underused and Lucas's performance made me convinced he was a baddie instead of the hero, for some reason. None of the characters have a back story, instead making do with a few lines mumbled here and there to fill in the gaps.There is a heck of a lot that sinks ""Poseidon"" that it would have gone under without the need for a rogue wave. At no point did I feel any sympathy for the characters or any sense of danger or excitement. What I did feel was that this was a disaster movie in every sense of the word, taking huge liberties with the plot and logic in order to expose our heroes to ever-increasing risks. But it was all for nothing - this is about as thrilling as defrosting a fridge and twice as laborious. And before you wag your fingers at me and mention something about a director's cut, I simply don't care - I'm trying to think of anything that would make me watch this again and with the possible exception of a gory death scene for Fergie's cameo, I can't come up with anything.

152,TheRadiobox,A godless remake,5,22 August 2020,"Poseidon was directed by Wolfgang Petersen, written by Mark Protosevich which adapts from the book by Paul Gallico, and stars Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Richard Dreyfuss, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Kevin Dillon, Freddy Rodriguez, and Andre Braugher. It follows a group of survivors as they fight for their lives on board a cruise ship capsized by a rogue wave.Plotting is standard fare, nearly every disaster movie cliché is made use of. On New Year's Eve, the Poseidon, a luxury cruise line is hit by a rogue wave which capsizes the ship. While much of the crew and passengers are killed, several people survive the overturn in the ballroom, including Dylan (Lucas), Robert (Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Rossum), her boyfriend Christian (Vogel), Maggie (Barrett) and her son Conor (Bennett), Nelson (Dreyfuss), Larry (Dillon), Elena (Maestro), Marco (Rodriguez), and captain Bradford (Braugher). As the ship continues to sink, this group of survivors begin to make their way to the bottom (er... top) of the ship; braving fires, a weakening structure, waterflow, electrical shocks, steam, and a dwindling count of survivors in order to get to the life rafts and stay afloat long enough to be rescued.Characters are subpar, with a lot of them just being plainly cliché. Dylan is a solid character, having spent time in the navy and become a high-rolling gambler. While not much is given to his backstory, it is interesting to see someone who has made good calls and bad ones in the movie be the leader. It makes him feel more human. Robert is fine, having the requisite tragic backstory of the group and a bit of fame from his time as a mayor. Maggie is merely the romantic interest for Dylan, and Conor is the young one to get to where the fully grown characters cannot. Nelson is the older one, Jennifer is the daughter, Christian is the boyfriend/fiancée, and Elena exists. There are really only a couple characters in the movie, the rest are just filler to add to the stakes and to nerf the characters with personality as to not make them superheroes. While most of the characters are bland, the movie does try to sneak in some development even during its action scenes, so it's not all perfunctory spectacle. Performances are mostly fine; Lucas, Russell, Barrett, and Dreyfuss able to provide a semblance of character depth.Action is solid, with most of the set pieces being well put together. From the beginning it is clear that Petersen and his team are adept at creating spectacle. The initial flipping of the ship is very well shown, with people sliding around, being thrown from heights, and objects and debris going everywhere; it is pulse pounding stuff. A scene involving an elevator shaft is invigorating due to the thinness of the platform the characters are forced to use, although the outcome is clear as soon as the sequence begins, which does take away from the tension that was already weak to begin with due to the limited personality of the characters. This caveat of unremarkable characters sinks the tension on multiple occasions (pun intended), with a scene where the group has to swim through a flooded corridor losing suspense because all of the characters with any degree of life to them go first, leaving the less interesting ones in the back to potentially die. While it is all well shot and shown, most of the action feels inconsquential.Technically the movie is very good. Special effects are some of the best in recent memory, and while not perfect, a vast majority of the movie looks just as good now as it must have back during its release; although there are some moments where it starts to crack, such as a shot where Nelson looks out at the wave and the green hue around him from the keying is still clearly visible. Scoring is decent and helps to elevate tension when present, but is painfully forgettable as soon as it is over. Pacing is good too, while there are some lulls in the action that leave the viewer wanting either some more of said action, or some degree of character development, these moments are few and far between which allows for the movie to flow smoothly. Writing does leave some to be desired. Some of the dialogue is cheesy, with lines like ""I feel like i know your dad."" ""He was mayor of New York for a while."" ""Cool."" ""No, it wasn't."" And ""Hey, who's shooting at us?"" Most of what is not cheesy is unremarkable. And some character decisions are just plain stupid, contradicting intelligent actions that were made by the same characters earlier in the movie. It is all great to look at, but hard to listen to.Poseidon is a fine disaster/action movie that has fantastic effects and sound design but is weighed down by several clichés within the dialogue and the action, and very few in the way of characters to get attached to. While it is easy to watch, it is endlessly predictable and needed a bit more meat on the bones to make it memorable.59/100",Poseidon
153,senortuffy,Another dull remake,5,18 August 2006,"The secret to an ensemble disaster film is that the audience has to have a rooting interest in the characters. It's a given some people will perish during the course of the movie, and the fun is in guessing who dies and who makes it.In this weak remake of the 1972 Irwin Allen classic, the characters are hopelessly dull and forgettable. I couldn't make an emotional attachment to a single person in the film, not like with Shelley Winters or Red Buttons in the original. What you have are faceless people coping with tremendous adversity, and what happens to them in the end is meaningless.Normally, Wolfgang Peterson is a top-notch director of thrillers, but in this film the pacing is all wrong. Almost from the start, the action comes in frenetic clips that drown out any chance of character development. There is entirely too much reliance on computer graphics to generate excitement, and way too many explosions and fires that detract from the story line.Speaking of which, the plot is flimsy at best. Like in the original, a wave overturns a massive cruise liner, and a small group of people struggle to climb upward towards the bottom of the ship in order to escape. If you completely suspend reality for a few hours and accept some of the crazy premises in the film, it's mildly entertaining, but considering the huge sum of money it took to make this film, that's not nearly enough.No wonder Hollywood has begun to cut back on movie budgets.",Poseidon
154,highwaytourist,"Excellent special effects, but that's about all",6,17 February 2014,"Most are familiar with painting-by-the-numbers. This needless remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is filmmaking-by-the-numbers. The original, while no classic, is fun. Well, this film takes the premise but dumps everything else. The biggest liability is the script by hack screenwriter Mark Protosevich. In this film, a new cast of main characters is brought in. They include a former New York City mayor who was once a fireman (pushes all the post 9/11 buttons), a former Navy Seal, the ex-Mayor's daughter, her fiancé, an elderly architect, and a few stock characters. What are the odds that a former Navy Seal, a former fireman-turned-Mayor, and a successful architect would be among the handful of survivors? Talk about convenient. When a tidal wave turns the ship upside down and splatters most of the passengers on the ceilings, the handful of survivors must make their way to the hull to escape before the ship sinks under the ocean. The director, Wolfgang Peterson, directed exciting sailing-themed movies like ""Das Boot"" and ""The Perfect Storm"" and he excels in these kinds of films, so the action sequences are superbly staged. In addition, the sets are convincing and the special effects are impressive. So why does the film fall so flat? It never gives the audience any reason to care. They go from one near-catastrophe to another with little character development at all. The whole film seems mechanical, as though it were developed by a computer instead of a human writer. In fact, the actors are little more than props. None of them give bad performances, but none stand out, either. Kurt Russell as the ex-Mayor and Josh Lucas as the veteran are talented enough to get through this film, but neither are able to carry it. The rest of the roles are pretty cardboard. Kevin Dillon is convincing enough as an obnoxious drunken gambler (wearing black, of course), but his two-dimensional character serves no purpose except for the audience to hiss at. He might as well have been Snivley Whiplash. Richard Dreyfuss plays an aging, despondent architect who's unlucky in love well, but his character has little screen time. Mike Vogel is OK as the fiancé' of the Mayor's daughter, but he little to do but look good in a wet t-shirt. The three female leads (Emily Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, and Mia Maestro) are pretty brunettes who look great in evening gowns and perform competently. But they all look and dress so alike and their characters are so so underdeveloped, they are interchangeable. The only things the female characters contribute to the film are screaming and cleavage. Also, they go from one near-death experience to another so quickly, it became numbing. I felt sorry for the actors. They visibly struggled in realistic sets facing real deluges of water and it's sad to see them work so hard for a film that wasn't worth the effort and did nothing for their careers. I hope they were well-paid.",Poseidon
155,vasco_cid,"The Poseidon ""Mis""Adventure",3,17 July 2006,"Despite it's Titanic scope, The Poseidon never generated enough buzz to make people think it might actually be a box-office hit. Well, it turned out to be right and Poseidon was indeed a big flop (considering it cost 150 million to make and grossed around 65 million domestically). Every year producers pray that their big budget bets don't sink, because some eventually do. This year, so far it's Poseidon that sank big time in more than one way. Is the disappointment understandable? Yes. Completely. Wolfgang Petersen has lost his flair for the dramatics, he compressed the whole story in 90 minutes and a B-class adventure movie. This, by itself is not a flaw, for there are countless 90 minutes commercial-adventure movies that are very good. Clearly this is not the case. The movie starts with the Poseidon already at sea (not a bad starting point) with a very well shot opening scene. From there on, everything goes down. Literally. The movie starts too late, the wave comes in too early, we are not familiarized with the characters yet (but we never will anyway), the story development is unworthy of the name, and we find ourselves rooting for the ship to kill every character as fast as possible. I guess that if Warner Brothers wants to blame anyone for the way things have turned out, I guess it is Mark Protosevich. He is not only the responsible for this atrocious piece of writing, but also for penning The Cell, one of the worst movies ever committed to screen. The sets are just to corny.. you don't believe for a second that you are inside a ship...The cast itself doesn't help. Josh Lucas is a firm choice for lead but he doesn't have people supporting him. The only ones we end up caring about are him, the mother, the son and the Spanish stowaway. It is even obvious that Fargie did this for a quick buck and a quick break from Black Eyed Peas. A few years back i liked the silly summer blockbusters and still do. But when a movie about a ship capsizing with the whole crew inside, and a desperate urge to escape doesn't generate any excitement from watching it, there are only two answers: either I'm aging to fast, or the quality of Hollywood's blockbusters(?) is really...., hum..... SINKING...",Poseidon

The movie has effects and lots of them I knew that when I saw the trailer but it seems the same thing is happening over and over. An obstacle in their way, diving into water, swimming and after a while it gets tiring. The first hour was great I enjoyed it but then it slowly became reclusive in its actions.

158,samseescinema,the studio has paid a steep price for mediocrity,5,12 May 2006,"Poseidon rating: 2.0 out of 4Wolfgang Peterson's drowning at the deep end now. After bombing the $150 million Troy in 2004 and losing the studios more than $50 million, the hawks surrounding Hollywood doubted any studio would ever have the chutzpah to hand ole' Wolfy another $100+ million project. But somebody was feeling lucky in L.A. and had pockets deep enough to afford Poseidon a $160 million and risk with Mr. Peterson. This producer must now be tightening the noose as he watches Wolfgang's final cut. $160 million is a lot to pay for colossal mediocrity. Hell, it's a lot to pay for a quality film. But Poseidon won't even pull through at the box office. Despite having nothing to do with its predecessor, the 1972 Poseidon Adventure, the stigma of ""yet another remake"" is growing tired among audiences. And with lukewarm star power and probable critical lashings, Mr. Peterson's career, for all intensive purposes, should be considered over.Poseidon has so little to do with The Poseidon Adventure that parallelisms are more appropriately launched towards James Cameron's Titanic. To get your bearings straight, think Titanic with flashing neon lights, sans romance and naked portraits, and with a whole lot more claustrophobic suspense. But Poseidon can't be criticized for turning a cold shoulder to its roots; The Poseidon Adventure wasn't much fun anyhow. The bitter truth to that statement, though, is that this newfangled, highly-priced remix is just as mediocre. As it opens, we immediately encounter screenwriter Mark Protosevich's clunky approach to character development. We flit about a ballroom lobby, the camera swinging to each of Protosevich's stock characters and are introduced to their hackneyed emotional issues in sore attempts to draw our sympathy. But this is a disaster flick; we're all aware this is just the obligatory lull before the storm and the scenes only muster up a sincere form of apathy for these cramped characters. But a stumbling in these opening segments is excusable as long as Peterson can cover up Protosevich's banality with heaping piles of excitement. And so the ""rogue wave"" hits the ship and flips the behemoth on its top, leaving the survivors huddled in the temporary sanctuary of the lobby. But for hardened Navy veteran Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), waiting to be saved isn't enough. He makes an attempt to sneak away from the lobby and is followed by five others. Later we meet up with Elena Gonzalez (Mia Maestro), Jennifer Ramsey (Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend Christian (Mike Vogel), who've been trapped in the discotheque. Jennifer's father, Robert (Kurt Russell), makes the rescue, and takes them to join Dylan's group. From there, the suspense snowballs, and the group is soon fighting off the water with dizzying speed. These scenes of suspense are hit and miss, hinging mostly on how inventive Protosevich becomes. David Koepp, a master of writing big-budget suspense, drove last year's War of the Worlds with incredible fluidity, hurling his poor characters into increasingly hideous situations devoid of happenstance, convenience or contrivance. Protosevich would do well to study Koepp's methods, as his scenes are based more on structure than invention: the group must reach the top (or bottom, depending on how you see it) of the ship before the water catches them. Like a video game, each level contains a new challenge and puzzle for our characters to defeat. And also like a video game, some of the levels are fun and some, well, aren't. Poseidon often runs into tired bouts of contrivance, where the characters' survival swings in the balance of a convenient happenstance. But even despite some monster contrivances, there are still scenes of authentic excitement. In one, the characters crawl through a vertical ventilation shaft rapidly filling with water. At the top, they find a steel covering blocking their escape. Stacked upon one another and soon to be drowning, they scramble to find an exit. It's claustrophobic and exhaustive with suspense. These scenes, however, aren't enough to mask Poseidon's hulking fault lines. These characters are no better than those we found in the same ship in 1972. They just dress better. It doesn't help that Peterson's direction is desperate and unremarkable. Emmy Rossum is delectable throughout, but this may just be my little crush (what can I say?). The budget shows off some spectacular sets and some fancy footwork with lighting, stunts, and CGI, but this is its slick veneer. Poseidon's the first big disappointment of the Summer. And although it's not a full-fledged disaster, the studio has paid a steep price for mediocrity.",Poseidon
159,bernie-122,"Deep ocean, shallow movie",3,14 August 2006,"It's all been said already, but I have to add my 2 cents. I didn't initially assume this film had any connection with the original, but soon after it began, I experienced an unmistakable episode of deja vu. This was confirmed when I spotted Irwin Allen somewhere in the credits. This guy was responsible for some of the worst programs ever shown on TV, such as Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, Time Tunnel, etc. He is the sole reason why the original film was so unwatchably cheesy, and couldn't be saved even by the likes of Hackman and Borgnine. Any production touched by Allen must include at least one ultra-irritating character, such as that totally insufferable Dr. Smith in Lost in Space.While this one is not nearly so bad in this regard, it is still cheesy enough to be mildly irritating. Added to the intensely cliché plot and the mandatory (these days) Hollywood CGI effects, this is guaranteed to be a flop of epic proportions.It's very, very sad; today I watched Polanski's ""Chinatown"" (1974), very nearly, if not the, best film ever made. Period. What's sad is that nobody in Hollywood could even remotely approach making a film like that today. They think we won't like it without tons of special effects and/or some gut-wrenching drama and lubricated throughout by slick cliché. There seems to be assumption that the movie-watching public's attention span has dwindled to the point where they won't watch anything else. Maybe it's even true.Well, there's still a few of us around discerning enough to tell the difference between good, artistic output and mindless, shallow drivel. Sadly, it's just a business these days, and MSD packs them in, for one showing anyway, so that's what they're gonna give us.

It seems like they said ""hey, let's do another remake. We'll throw together some actors, tilt some sets and let the CGI crew take over."" There's no real storyline, it's full of usual character stereotypes and really, really bad lines. Did they not have enough budget for real water? CG water and fire looks really stupid and obvious. One of my favorite bad scenes was when they got out of the ship and all jumped in the water to the....well, look at that, an inflated life raft just sitting here ready to go...how convenient. I was actually laughing at the stupidity. I was also hysterical with how nobody was affected by the cold salty water and everyone could hold their breath for several minutes.

And I really liked the thrill and VFX of the sequence that is the turning point of the film. Richard Dreyfuss is as hysterical as he is hilarious. Watch the deed that is cancelled because of the huge wave. Kurt Russell and Emmy Rossum are great in the roles as estranged father and daughter and this theme is repeated throughout the film. Josh Lucas is ever zealous and tough as the man determined to survive along with his company. But what about more exposition? What was Dreyfuss's phone call really all about? He seems to forget the interpersonal conflict plaguing him during the ordeal... It was funny that I was tempted to answer Kurt Russell when his character states that ""I used to be a fireman before..."" Well yeah? In BACKDRAFT.... It also seemed intentional to kill of the sleazy drunkard who has all but been devoid of etiquette wishing to go ahead of Jennifer Ramsey (Rossum) in the crossing. The bastard got what he deserved...Kidding aside, there was an Armagedonny moment in the end when Christian, Rossum's fiancée decides that he is the best person for the job in turning the propellers off because of his swimmer's ability. But no real denouement is ever brought between Kurt Russell and Rossum. LIkewise what of Richard Dreyfuss and the person he was calling? There was also no expression from Rossum's part at least to her husband to be about how grateful she was for her Father and perhaps resolve between the two was reserved for the next life? Josh Lucas, the other lady and the kid were also obviously living happily ever after but because of the lack of depth of resolve and character study, at least in the climax, the happy ending isn't justified.6/10",Poseidon
164,etsm92,The very less than perfect storm.,5,8 September 2006,"Poseidon/2006/**Main Stars: Josh Lucas Kurt Russell Richard DreyfussAstonishing director Wolfgang Peterson directs a film that is a remake of a film that is based on a book about a cruise that capsizes (completely turns over). That last part of my sentence is very rare. A cruise CAN capsize but what are the chances that a giant rogue wave will tip over a boat? Not very many. Well, if it couldn't do that then there would be no book or movie to make but that wouldn't be the worst thing because the two movies made (The Poseidon Adventure and Poseidon) aren't good anyway. I have to admit, the book is probably better than the movie. And, yes, I know that the book was a fantasy so, yeah, I guess it's legit if you put it in that genre about a boat capsizing. But adapting it and making it into a movie is wrong. For one thing (as I mentioned before) the original wasn't that good (however it was unintentionally funny) and another thing, almost every disaster film has terribly hammy acting! I'm sick of it! You can make a drama that has wonderful acting but when it comes to disaster films all you rely on is the visual of it; no dialogue, no acting. The story is stupid anyway so it makes a stupid movie. I do, however, have to compliment the director of photography and composer of the music. I saw the behind the scenes and in a few scenes the director of photography had thirteen cameras filming one scene so that he could get alternative views of the scene and pick out which one was best. Or use multiple cameras to film certain parts of the scene. He did both. The composer of the music was Klaus Badelt, composer of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Of course, the music was great and he is very talented. Another compliment is that this movie took a long time to make and they tried and tried as much as they could (they = filmmakers, etc. for people who don't have a clue) but at least have a good story and acting to go along with it. If not, then just get the good story in there somewhere. Just good acting and no story, we're back in the same situation again. So, what happens exactly to the ship Poseidon? Well if you saw the previews, then you've practically already seen the scene. The ship capsizes from an enormous wave called a rogue wave which is very rare. The night is New Year's Eve and the people are celebrating and getting ready for the countdown. During the wait, you see people getting drunk, terrible music playing in the background typical cruise. And of course none of the people are prepared for this giant rogue wave to hit them. They're having a fun time partying. The captains don't say anything over the loudspeaker about it so far-fetched. Typical. WHAM! The ship gets hit. ""AAAAHHHH"" say the people while they're falling from the floor to the ceiling and dying just like that and smashing into glass so graceful... And a bunch of people are covered in blood which they just smacked on their faces before they did the scene That scene was dumb along with people being able to dive into water and not be able to breathe for ten minutes and still swim anyway even though they should be gasping for air or DEAD The main character Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) is one that actually survives and tries to move the rest of the people that actually survived toward the BOTTOM of the ship (remember the ship capsized) to save them. Then the other main characters Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) and Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) are ones who also survive and need to be guided up to the bottom of the ship. It is the same with The Poseidon Adventure (the original film) so it is kind of like watching it over again except with worse acting, better sets, different cast, and, most importantly, not using the Christmas tree as a ladder like they did in the original. So it's a typical disaster movie (literally). However, there was one scene where ONE CHARACTER dies because he couldn't get back in time to breathe air in and dies underwater (other people died other ways). If he was able to get back in time without breathing, that would be too cliché. But the entire movie is cliché anyway so why am I just applying that to one scene?

165,Adorable,Ever Had That Sinking Feeling?,6,21 May 2006,"Ironically for a project based on the sheer size of its main story vehicle, Poseidon comes in at a short 90 minutes, barely meeting current norms for feature length films. This remains its primary shortcoming though also a blessing as in most other aspects it's a passable, if not even remotely brilliant, foray providing viewers with sufficient frills but nothing much to retain in the longer run.A remake of 1972 disaster flick The Poseidon Adventure, Wolfgang Petersen's version lacks the sheer impact of its predecessor which, although no masterpiece in its own right, still heralded the onset of 70's calamity-vision in a way the modern retelling could never hope to repeat. There was also a made-for-TV edition a couple of years back but it seems few have had the pleasure of beholding it over this tight, $150 million gargantua. You'd be right to wonder where the money ended up considering they barely give out an hour and a half of movie, but then perhaps it would be enough to look at the totally Titanic-scuttling visuals to understand Poseidon's expense account devoted itself to plastics instead of content.In true roller-coaster-ride fashion, little time is wasted on introducing characters, backstory or any other such trifling matter. Petersen charges ahead like Achilles lunging at the Trojan army, probably pushed along by the looming specter of rolling credits. Enter a New Year's Eve ball aboard the world's premier cruise ship, or at least presumed premier going on size, grandeur and behemoth dining area. It's based upon real-world floating palace Queen Mary 2, with elaborate set designs and authentic-looking environments. Unfortunately, not enough time and space are devoted to exploring the ship and its voyage, with everything moving along too fast to linger on mood-building components.The captain goes on a bit about how everyone's lives will be better riding on Poseidon's back into the future, when the conn detects trouble a-brewing. The god's namesake finds herself confronted with a monstrous freak wave, a wall of water done well in impressive CGI but still ludicrously over-sized, eclipsing the 200ft boat. Following this brief preliminary segment, the bulk of the movie commences, pitting characters against a capsized luxury superliner where danger lurks at every corner. Unlike the original, in this rendition most of the passengers are cast aside early on, leaving the movie to center around a small group of survivors as they struggle to reach safety on top (now bottom) of devastated Poseidon.Leading the charge are former NYC mayor Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell in one of his weaker roles recently), who also faces challenges from his semi-renegade daughter (Emmy Rossum), and gambling maestro Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas from Hulk and Glory Road). There's very little tension between these two protagonists, with whatever conflict injected into the story coming from either the dying ship and ever-possible drowning, or Kevin Dillon's badly-conceived character, an annoying lounge lizard that fortunately exists stage prematurely. As do a few of the characters in a distinctly gory fashion, at least within the context of a PG-13 release. Overall, Poseidon's quite emboldened in its depiction of miserable demises, with people falling, drowning, getting impaled and burning like there's no tomorrow basically at every juncture. Together with smooth pacing and consistent effects, this trait buttresses Poseidon's worth as a quickie indulgence.Beyond acceptable sea-faring adventure and maritime visuals dwarfing anything we've seen thus far, the film has little of note. Even veteran performers like Richard Dreyfuss (portraying a broken-hearten socialite contemplating suicide just before disaster strikes) fail to save the day, resulting in a mix that doesn't keep viewers entranced on the basis of acting prowess alone.No, shorter than its precursor and lacking the heroic naivete so typical of big-budget adventure stories of that halcyon era, the new Poseidon comes and goes without leaving too much of a trace, good or bad. Scant character development and hard-boiled drama that seemingly just happens out of nowhere conform with an altogether different movie-making ethos, one reflecting events of latter periods, where audiences are presumed to possess shortened attention spans and a cynical palate. Gone are the long-winded romanticism and emotional import, instead this incarnation, stem to bow, steers closer to the flash-disaster method employed in similar contemporary projects.And that's a shame, because with that cargo in tow, Poseidon's doomed to sink beneath the rippling waves of cinematic history like so much wreckage.Rating * * *",Poseidon

167,Robert_Hearth,"""Dad, Do You Have Any Idea How Big This Ship Is?"" --- Jennifer Ramsey (Emmy Rossum)",7,8 October 2006,"""Poseidon"" (2006) Directed By: Wolfgang Petersen Starring: Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum, Jacinda Barrett, Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, and Andre Braugher MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for intense prolonged sequences of disaster and peril) ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), starring Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters, is one of my favorite movies of all time. While campy and a little cheesy, it was still a massive achievement in disaster film-making. It delivered an array of interesting and well-developed characters and thrust them into a nightmare that can best be described as ""Hell, Upside-Down"". While it certainly has its critics, it is, for the most part, quite a beloved film and has become a wonderful classic. Naturally, it was decided that a remake should be created. This is that remake. At first, I sneered at this film. The 1972 version had a spark that propelled it to greatness and I didn't foresee that happening again. But, when the cast was announced, I decided that there might just be some hope after all and I decided to give it a chance. The trailers looked promising and the first images from the movie were quite impressive. When I went to the theater to see the film, I was hoping to see the surprise hit of the summer--a film that turned out to be a masterpiece, rather than the disappointment I originally prepared for. Did I get what I was hoping for? Well, no. What I got was a typical Hollywood action film with a big-budget, explosions, and plenty of action. The problem is not with the excess of action or the use of special effects. The problem is with the lack of characterization. The characters lacked the interest of the ones presented in the 1972 movie, making much of the action far less effective. After all, watching a ship capsize is far more effective if we actually know and care about the characters on-board.If you have seen ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (1972), then you know the plot here, as it is much of the same thing. It is New Year's Eve and a luxury cruise liner is capsized by a rogue wave. A small band of survivors, including the former mayor of New York, Robert Ramsey (Russell), must now climb to the bottom of the ship (which is now the top) and find a way out via the propeller shafts. As you have probably already figured out, as this is a disaster movie, that the majority of this film is death and destruction and our survivors are only really there to give the film a reason for showing such destruction. This is a problem. With the 1972 film, you felt that you were watching the characters survive, not a ship getting destroyed. Here, it is the opposite. We are given maybe fifteen to twenty minutes of pre-disaster characterization and then the remainder of the film is just explosions, fires, death, drowning, water, and a lot of computer-generated effects. We are given a little insight into our character's lives, but none of it particularly matters. We learn that Robert Ramsey's daughter, Jennifer (Rossum), was miserable when her father was mayor and that his marriage was ruined due to his jobbut this is only touched upon and it never really matters. It is mentioned briefly and, after everything was said and done, it had nothing to do with the movie. We also learn that one of the characters, Richard Nelson (Dreyfuss), is gay and that, since his lover left him, he has become suicidal. One would expect this to matter, given the life or death situation in which he has found himself, yet it never does. In fact, he is in the process of leaping off of the ship when he sees the wave and yet, after he does, he tries to fight for his life just like everyone else.Do not get me wrong. ""Poseidon"" is a very capable Hollywood blockbuster. It is quick, packed with action, and extremely exciting. Two love stories are thrown into the mix and it naturally has a tragically bittersweet ending, in which one character must die to save the others (if you didn't see it coming, then you shouldn't be allowed to watch another movie ever again). I never found myself looking at my watch, because I didn't have time to do so. In fact, had this not been a remake, I am very sure that I would never have noticed the lack of characterization, but, as it is a remake of a movie that prided itself on its amazing characters, its lack of intriguing or interesting characters were a huge problem. If you missed this film in theaters, then you missed out on seeing some of the impressive disaster sequences ever brought to screen in all of their glory. But, I still wouldn't rule out seeing ""Poseidon"". You can still appreciate the stunning action and the beautiful special effects. Coupled with all of this, ""Poseidon"" also has a wonderful musical score that rounds out the movie's overall awe-inspiring aura. The appearance of this film is stunning and Wolfgang Petersen's direction draws you into an almost surreal world. Before the destruction of the ship, it looks so perfect and pristine. This is an effect used by many disaster movies, in which they make the pre-disaster area look more perfect than it actually is to enhance the tragedy of the post-disaster area. Some films don't pull it off and end up making the pre-disaster setting look fake and cheesy. ""Poseidon"", on the other hand, pulls it off perfectly.Final Thought: Though lacking any characterization whatsoever, ""Poseidon"" is an entertaining movie with excellent special effects.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",Poseidon
168,mcsheehey,"Not a Masterpiece, but Too Harshly Dismissed",6,29 April 2007,"It goes without saying that this film is nowhere near as great a film as the original ""Poseidon Adventure."" However, it is in no way a bad film. Everyone knows the story of the film. A bunch of rowdy, filthy rich for the most part, and carefree passengers of a cruise ship are busy celebrating the New Year with Fergie when a giant wave flips the ship over. Before the crash of the wave, we get a peek into the lives of some random passengers, especially the lives of Kurt Russel's and Josh Lucas's characters. These are the people that we spend the entire movie with, that is until they are picked off one by one in often heroic, yet sometimes simply bizarre death sequences. These sequences keep the movie moving with a high level of intensity. Still, the side conflicts of these characters seem very small in the whole scheme of things, and are often distracting. The acting also provides no real life savers, sending us plunging into frustration. The real saving factor of this film is the special effects. Oscar-nominated effects are the driving force of this film, and they're pretty darn good. We're treated to stunning visuals, epic sound effects, grandeur location sweeps, and an occasional performance by Fergie's nightclub singing character. This film is filled with crowd-pleasing moments, such as the giant wave crashing on to the boat and Fergie's death (did I say that out loud). Though it is rather mawkish and ridiculous at times, Poseidon does eventually deliver.",Poseidon
169,thewillt08,Good Special Effects Don't Make an A+ Movie,6,25 November 2012,"Poseidon is known as the god of the sea, also, a remake of the 1970s film about a capsized cruise ship in the middle of the ocean. I have a lot to say about this movie and I will try my best not to compare it to the 1972 version, The Poseidon Adventure, even though the '72 version was much better. Come on people, its Kurt Russell going up against Gene Hackman in his prime, we all know who wins that fight.It is New Years Eve and passengers on a cruise ship are partying and enjoying themselves when they are struck by a rogue wave. This wave was massive and had enough energy to tip the boat upside-down. A small group of passengers go against captain's orders and try to escape on their own, and there is our story. I bought this on blu ray the other day and I expected the special effects and sound quality to be fantastic. Well, at least I got one. The blu ray and the picture were amazing. The wave hitting the ship and the water pouring into the ship made me remember The Titanic, and anytime something reminds me of my favorite movie of all time it can't be a bad thing. My favorite scene was when the oil spills into the water and the electricity sparks the oil. It causes a waterfall of fire, which doesn't really make sense. I guess it would be a ""firefall"" but you get the point. Anyway, the effects looked amazing and the converted blu ray loom really well throughout. The sound quality was annoying because when the water was flowing it was really loud but when nothing was really going on and people were talking it was quiet. I found myself constantly changing the volume and it is really unnecessary. This movie was entertaining for sure, but I wasn't sure what the goal was. Was the goal to make a movie where it focuses on the special effects? Or a movie which tries to get into characters and their stories? A major problem I had was that the wave and disaster started within twenty minutes of the film. They introduce all of the characters, dive into a little conflict between Kurt Russell, his daughter, and her boyfriend, but that is about it. The director could have put the time in, developed characters, and made a good story with meaning and emotion. Instead he put characters in a movie and just killed them later and kind of developed them in a confusing way. The characters are a little annoying and very basic. We have a single mom, an over protected dad, an old and lonely man who is lovable, a jackass who gets killed off, and above all is the hero who has a rough side and a soft side. That is Dylan who I think is the main character. He is smart and a decent hero and he does the closest thing to developing in the story. Poseidon was incredibly predictable. When characters are introduced you can easily tell if they are going to live or die. That was a great shame in the movie. After watching it a few times I realized this movie had so much potential. Some scenes could have been cut out and the movie could have been extended. I feel like this movie could have been so much more but the makers took the easy way out to make some quick case with effects end a sinking ship to attract an audience.Overall, Poseidon was an entertaining movie. Was it great? No, but it had its strengths and very weak points. Poseidon is a good time and something I like to call a ""background movie."" Meaning, it is a movie you can pop in with friends or at a party and not pay full attention. It s a decent movie but extremely forgettable. I recommend the original movie from 1972, it is much better.",Poseidon

There is a lot of intense action that keeps one on the edge of their seat.There is not much drama and I do not think it will add too much to the original story.

172,the-gossip-king,Good not great,7,6 April 2008,"Let me start off by saying I love Wolfgang Peterson as a director but I really think he needs to broaden his horizons. He is known for making intelligent action flicks. I love him for that but honestly the man is a visionary and should try something new for a change. Anyway, to the movie. Good not great. A lot more intelligent and well researched. It still has typical action flaws like how an earth can someone breath underwater for what feels like five minutes but thats an action flick and you appreciate that. Visual effects are amazing. I still think Troy is the movie that produces the best effects but this is a worthy competitor. You also have your typical human interest stories which are one of the only things that annoy me in this man's film because they always feel like he has just thrown them in there without much care. The other thing about his movies that annoys me is the fact that he doesn't work on his actors much. I liked Brad Pitt in Troy but a lot of people didn't. I did not however like Josh Lucas and Kurt Russel was alright but not extremely appealing. That said I thin the worst main actor for one of his movies goes to Dustin Hoffman in Outbreak. It is probably his best action movie but I laugh when I see Dustin Hoffman try and be serious in this movie and I also think the man needs to work on his dialogue. I no this sounds like a scathing review but I did enjoy it and it kept me interested throughout the whole movie which is the main point of a movie so yeah, I wouldn't hesitate to call this a decent movie, with errors though!",Poseidon

174,rstef1,Remake Sinks,3,23 August 2006,"I just finished watching this on video and boy am I glad that I didn't pay full price for this turkey at the theater. I loved the original which I saw at the movies when it first came out and I was really looking forward to this remake. When the reviews hit, none of my friends would go to see it so I had to wait to see it on home video. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my friends for saving me some money.So what's wrong with the movie? Most egregiously, every character is completely forgettable. I couldn't tell some of the actresses apart once they got wet. The actors try hard but they have little to work with. Their characters have been written with a paper thinness that makes every other disaster movie's cast look like it was scripted by Shakespeare. I blame the writer entirely for this debacle. It's as if he didn't give a crap about motivation or character development. Just throw some stereotypes into a dangerous situation and let the (supposed) fun begin. We get almost no introduction to these people before the wave hits about 13 minutes into this flick. Why should I care about any of these people when I have no idea who they are or why they are worthy of my empathy? Nothing is done during their climb to the hull to make me care. It's all about outrunning the water and fire and explosions. So what??? Some of them just struck me as blandly obnoxious and I could have cared less what became of them! In the original, the writers took the time to introduce the cast and let us get to know them, both before the wave and during their ascent to freedom. We cared what happened to them, we liked and rooted for them. Not here, no way.Kurt Russell is stoic, Josh Lucas brooding, Richard Dreyfus makes no impression whatsoever. The young couple are cinematic cyphers as are the stereotypical mom and young son, who has an annoying habit of wandering off for NO REASON, except to throw some additional rescue scenes into the stew. Mia Maestro is saddled with the tired part of the panicky female and Kevin Dillon underused as the angry drunk guy. You'll have little trouble figuring out who will make it and who won't if you've seen a couple other films of this type. Sheesh! Is this the best Hollywood can come up with with this kind of director, cast and the money spent on the production? The one good thing was the special effect of the wave hitting and capsizing the ship, along with the ensuing flooding and explosions, but this is only about ten minutes of entertainment in an hour and a half. Skip this one and go rent the original, it's way more fun and entertaining.",Poseidon
175,Phantasm01,Well I enjoyed it...,8,9 August 2006,"Over the last several years many of the fans (myself included) have thought that, in the right hands, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from a remake.And in Mr. Petersen the producers found the perfect filmmaker. How could Warner Bros go wrong with the brilliant, visionary director of the claustrophobic classic ""Das Boot"" and the brilliant ""The Perfect Storm?"" Combine the best elements of those two films with the classic tour-de-force survival story originally told by Paul Gallico in his 1969 novel and a new movie could become a critical and box office success.So with much anticipation I headed to see ""Poseidon"" this past weekend. The long awaited remake is a tremendous spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire length of the movie.The story is well known to just about everybody. During New Years Eve celebrations aboard the S.S. Poseidon, a monster rogue wave comes out of nowhere, slams into the luxury liner, capsizing her and leaving a few survivors, led by Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell, to try and find an escape from the upside down water trap.Petersen begins the film with one of the most stunning opening shots in the history of film: A 3-minute wrap-around of the grand luxury liner as she sails the Atlantic. What makes this scene so amazing is the fact that the ship doesn't really exist. The Poseidon is completely computer generated, yet when you see her up on that screen you can only be in awe. She is majestic and stately - and puts a certain James Cameron luxury liner to shame.We are then introduced to the main characters at a quick clip. Mark Protosevich's screenplay doesn't draw them very well, if at all. We learn very little about our travelers, and that misguided calculation bothers me. But, I'll speak to that in a moment. Because just as I was starting to let the lack of characterization bother me, the mighty Greek God of the Sea lashes out at our New Years revelers and spins their world upside down in a heart-pounding capsize sequence that bests the original's by a mile.From there it's non-stop, edge-of-your-seat, hair-raising action as our rag tag group of survivors fight their way up the dying ship to find an escape, battling water and obstacles and more water along the way. Petersen's brilliant direction (assisted by Klaus Badelt's nerve-racking score) on three scenes in particular will have you climbing the walls.The first involves a scene in which Richard Dreyfuss' character is faced with one of the most gut-wrenching decisions a human being would ever have to make. I could feel the audience collectively asking themselves ""God! What would I do?"" The second involves the group's ascent through an air vent. The claustrophobia in this scene is so intense if you're not climbing the walls then you need to have your head examined. The third involves a mother (played by Jacinda Barrett) and her son (Jimmy Bennett) and the rising waters. Mothers will be ready to pull their hair out during this segment.All of the action sequences are well done, but those three, spaced through out the movie, will leave you feeling exhausted...in a good way...as if it the cost of the ticket was money well spent.As with most well done disaster movies it's the action sequences and special effects that save ""Poseidon."" I recommend the movie highly and think that on my list of ""popcorn flicks"" this will join the original near the top. That is thanks in large part to Petersen, his computer and design crews, and a cast that did the best they could with the script they got.And it is that script where I find my sole disappointment. Why Warner Bros moved ahead with such a lackluster screenplay puzzles me. This had the chance to be a classic sea tale. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting ""Moby Dick,"" but Paul Gallico's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the consummate story of survival at sea. It is deep in character study; human nature complete with all of its flaws. It is dark and psychological and leaves the reader breathless.Unfortunately none of that transferred over in the 1972 film. When I read that Wolfgang Petersen would be at the helm of this new version I had high hopes that the dramatic human stories told in the Gallico novel would finally be told on the big screen. But it doesn't happen.Roger Ebert opined that he felt Petersen's heart wasn't in this film. I don't think that was it. To me it almost seems like Warner Bros wanted ""Poseidon"" in the can sooner rather than later and were willing to sacrifice a strong story in order to get the film on screens by May 12. As a result the film is awkwardly edited at times - as if there had been a script there, but that it was jettisoned and then a half-assed editing job done to plug the holes. It makes me wonder whether they purposefully threw away a potentially triumphant story for yet another piece of popcorn fluff.At this point it doesn't really matter, because the film is popcorn fluff. Mind you, it is well done, exciting, and thrilling popcorn fluff and I highly suggest you head to the theatre and give it a look. But, I just can't help but wonder ""what if?"" I'm afraid we'll never know, because it is highly doubtful that this story will be told again.",Poseidon

177,Joejoesan,"Fake, but okay",7,17 December 2006,"Being a big fan of the original movie I was very interested in this one. Unfortunately the Petersen Poseidon sank at the box office and I think I know why. In the original movie you really get the feeling that the water is really chasing our heroes. That was established in the scene where Gene Hackman and his group decide to climb to the engine rooms. Just after they reach safe grounds, the windows collapse and all the people in the big party room die a horrible death. Another thing why all the action didn't make a big impact was the fact that lots of it seemed fake. There were too many CGI scenes. It all looked great, but I didn't buy it. Having said all this I must admit that I did enjoy myself. Especially the end - in which one of our heroes sacrifies himself - was even better done than in the original. All in all an entertaining movie. But from a movie with a budget like that you can and should expect a lot more.",Poseidon

I like Josh Lucas as an actor and Kurt Russell is usually believable too, so how could it go wrong? The weird thing is, I am still not sure where it went wrong. It was a little short on the opening - the introductions of the characters were brief, therefore perhaps you really didn't get a chance to care too much about them? The special effects were good - I didn't keep thinking oooh CGI, like I did in Titanic and The Hulk, so that was good.The story was OK, the whole tidal wave thing was topical, and yet I didn't feel very connected to this film at all.I wish I knew why - but for some reason I felt the story didn't quite catch, the effects didn't quite last long enough, the characters weren't quite real enough to me. I mean (spoiler coming here) when Kevin Dillon's character died early on, I not only didn't care because his character was almost cartoon-like, I thought it was done so fast that it was as if the film makers didn't really care either.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 because it is watchable, but I wouldn't waste another $10 on it myself - much better to wait for it on DVD.",Poseidon
179,Critical Eye UK,Gel Upside Down,1,5 November 2007,"Apparently some sort of remake of The Poseidon Adventure for an audience of the brain-dead, Wolfgang Petersen's version does at least add to the standard lexicon of disaster movies by producing some of the most convincing CGI yet seen.It's therefore not immediately obvious that none of the cast are sentient beings, and that the names assigned to them -- Russell, Dreyfuss, Lucas etc -- could equally as well have been R2 and D2.Particularly adroit is the way no back story and no characterisation is allowed in even the slightest form: after all, a droid can only do so much with a part; saddling it with motives, emotions or even original dialog would really be too much to ask.All a droid can do is manage to swim underwater for 10 minutes at a time without breathing (well, they don't need to) and it's this which gives the game away.Verdict: Well worth seeing if you've given up smoking and thrown out all your ashtrays and need an alternative way to waste money other than by incinerating it.",Poseidon
180,Dandy_Desmond,Great special effects ...and erm...,5,8 May 2010,"Poseidon is a remake of the Poseidon Adventure from the early seventies, apart from the big wave and the fact the ship is called Poseidon there is nothing similar between the two movies which was a good idea. The film opens with a 'spectacular' two minute glide around the ship (totally CGI of course) which follows Josh Lucas jogging from deck to deck. In the special features they were proud to announce this shot took ages to create, was very awkward to shoot, cost so many xxx millions and set a record for the longest special effects shot or something. My first question was ... why? Answer: because they could. I mean was this necessary? When I watched it on the cinema I hardly noticed it to be honest so really a waste of money Wolfgang. We then get to know the people who we are going to be rooting for during the movie. This is where this film falls short. We get a quick introduction to each character then whammy! the wave hits and everything goes bananas and suddenly we're climbing decks, escaping explosions and water rising and hang on... are we supposed to care about these people? I didn't really. There are some horrible characters as well. The abusive drunk idiot who is obviously fodder as well as the non characters of the waiter and stow away. Imagine if the drunk guy had got more and more wasted and managed to bumble his way to safety and the others didn't! that would have been different. But no we know exactly who is going to bite the big one and after all the effects (which are impressive) it seems dare I say a little 'shallow' ha ha Worth a watch but a bit of a let down and if Wolfgang had put as much effort into developing the characters as he did the amazing 2 minute intro it could have been decent. 5 out of 10",Poseidon

182,cwrdlylyn,"POSEIDON : Plenty Of Action, Not Enough Tension...",5,17 May 2006,"POSEIDON I consider myself a huge fan of the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE and all it's ham-boned cheesiness. Though it wasn't the most dramatically perfect piece of 70's cinema, everyone involved seems to be trying so endearingly hard that you can't help but care about the fate of the S.S.S. Poseidon passengers even as you laugh at the ridiculous adventures they go through. And even with the lower standards of special effects and the dated look of the show, the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE had cinematography, direction, and some performances that really managed to evoke the unbearable tension of the scenario these people were stuck in.So my expectations weren't too high going into the new POSEIDON directed by Wolfgang Peterson... and I must admit that this new version kept me entertained in the theaters for it's 98-minute running time. The special effects here are truly spectacular in parts, especially the capsizing of the ship... and the perils and adventures the passengers take to survive have been changed around which adds to the excitement of this remake. However, in the end, the film doesn't do anything besides kill an hour and half of time with passable entertainment.The pieces were there for this to be a much better movie. Like I said, the special effect here were astonishing and great to watch. Unfortunately, they were framed and utilized poorly by the cinematographer and the director. In all the scenes using special effects and rising water, something about the camera-work here fails to capture the claustrophobia and tension these people must be feeling. Everything seems dangerous, but the way it's filmed is far too relaxed. As passengers climb across a shaky elevator wire, it all feels too relaxed. In a sequence that could have wonderfully captured and magnified every creak and every slight movement of the wire while the passengers walk across terrified of making a sudden movement. It is in this manner that POSEIDON fails. It fails to evoke the horror of the situation in favor of showing as much CGI waves and flames as possible. Wolfgang Peterson would have been wise to zoom in on the action much more and examine this situation with a claustrophobic/close in feel.Also weak here, as has been stated before, is the dialogue and character development. Honestly, I don't fault the actors so much, I actually give them credit. On paper, this script would be far worse than it is on film b/c the performers have clearly given their best effort to make the material better then it is. However, the script at times manages to bring the tension and action to a screeching halt as well. By choosing to focus on the happiness of a father and daughter sharing a secret and then happily crossing over a deadly fire on a wire... Peterson misses the opportunity to emphasize that in the end, the looming situation is inescapable even for the most tender of moments between a family.Basically, the 2006 version of POSEIDON is serviceable entertainment. Believe me, there have been Summer Blockbuster's far worse then this, but there have also been disaster films that are leagues above this. A disaster movie by definition is more than just an ""action"" movie, it tells the emotional story of people struggling to cope with insurmountable tragedy. Unfortunately, where as the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE was a disaster film, the new POSEIDON settles for simply being an action flick.... C- ...",Poseidon

The sequence where the massive wave turns the ship over is a dread-spectacle of such monstrous proportions that it makes TITANIC look like a a Tupperware party. If you are looking for a lightning paced, edge of your seat thrill-ride then POSEIDON delivers.

We saw Poseidon at Imax and the wave, as promised, was terrific. Even the underwater CGI views of the boat were okay because it was, well, underwater and believably blurry. Only when something or other burst and dripped oil down the main atrium did it look phony. And most of the action was believable, although it did get tiring to watch them go here, no go there, no go there.But, there was no replacement actor for Shelley Winters that worked well. Maybe it was the illegal immigrant, but she didn't make you root for her the way you rooted for Shelley. And the drunken guy who looked like Matt Dillon was a really stupid script move.",Poseidon

187,tonyjackie,Just go along for the ride,6,2 March 2008,"This isn't a masterpiece.It isn't even that great a movie.What it is though is a reasonably entertaining 90+ minutes that has good effects and very cheesy dialogue.Sometimes it is too easy to try and analyze every movie that you see but in the case of films like this you just have to take them for what they are.It is entertaining,it is clichéd and yes,it is as corny as hell.But at the end of the day so what?It is most probably a movie that you would only watch once and it does show a lack of imagination by way of being a remake.Does it add anything to the original?Apart from the improved special effects no,not really.But I am not going to slate this movie simply because I happened to quite enjoy it.It most definitely won't make the IMDb 250 but it is better than some of the titles in there,at least in my opinion.Watch it,rate it and forget about it.You may just think that it is a pile of tosh but at least it entertains for a while.",Poseidon
188,comquest,Like a tub of popcorn,7,16 May 2006,"Despite the lack of any discernible character development and many questionable plot points (i.e. electric generators that continue to work upside down and submerged), Poseidon delivers a pretty descent thrill ride. The cast, which included many accomplished actors old and new, deserved a much better script. But the fast pace and special effects bonanza will keep most people entertained for 90 minutes. At least the length of the film is not titanic.Poseidon is not a remake of The Poseidon Adventure, it's a new story based on the same concept: escaping from a capsized ocean liner. The stories differ in many significant ways - especially towards the end. Both movies suffer from cardboard characters with little depth. That was a common flaw for nearly every disaster movie made in the 1970s. Characters just chattered and burned up time while you waited for the big disaster to happen.Poseidon is like a Mega Tub of buttered popcorn. It tastes pretty good going down, but when the tub is empty you'll just drop it in the trash can. By the time you reach your car, you won't remember a thing. But hey! It was fun for a while.",Poseidon
189,eichelbergersports,Poseiden is a real disaster - movie,4,9 May 2006,"Although this fits firmly into the ""It Could Have Been Worse"" dept., one has to wonder if Hollywood has completely run out of original ideas, or if re-working old classics has become a cottage industry to lazy scriptwriters in these dark times.And while it's probably not very objective of me, I could not help comparing the newest Warner Bros. release, ""Poseiden,"" with its predecessor, 1972's ""The Poseiden Adventure."" This comparison occurred before, during and long after I viewed the screening of the $160 million revision. And, needless to say, the side-by-side examinations were not favorable to the latter version.First of all (and I fully realize most people out there under 20  the core group this film is aimed at  have never heard of, let alone seen, the original film), let's talk about the cast.In 1972, despite a somewhat goofy script, we still had Academy Award winners Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and Jack Albertson in leading roles. Even four-time Oscar nominee Arthur O'Connell had a cameo role, Leslie Neilson (before he discovered comedy) was the ship's captain, and Carol Lindley, Roddy MacDowell, Stella Stevens and Eric Shea (the little kid who was the voice of Linus in the early ""Peanuts"" cartoons) rounded out the competent ensemble.That movie even had the Grammy-winning, No. 1 single, ""Morning After"" as its theme song. Today, we have Oscar winner (for 1977's ""The Goodbye Girl"") Richard Dreyfess, as a gay architect; Kurt Russell, as a former fireman and Mayor of New York (that's what I said); Josh Lucas (fresh off ""Glory Road"" as a Navy veteran who seemingly knows everything about luxury liners); Emmy Rossum (""Phantom of the Opera""), as Russell's promiscuous daughter, Jennifer; her empty-headed boyfriend, Christian (Mike Vogel, ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants""); and Jacinda Barrett (""Bridget Jones: On The Edge Of Reason""), as single mom, Maggie James, towing her annoying offspring, Conner (Jimmy Bennett) along with her. You don't have to be Neptune to see this latest group just does not match up.After a ""rogue"" wave capsizes the ship just after New Year's Eve, this group disobeys the captain (Andre Braugher) and heads down, I mean up, to find an escape route through the propeller shaft.Okay, here's another problem I had with this version. In the original, we are told of an earthquake off the coast of Greece, which caused a tsunami. The crew was alerted to be on the lookout for a possible huge wave (although the curling action we see in both movies is physically wrong for a wave in the middle of the sea). It appears on the ship's radar, and though the passengers know nothing of it, we feel the tension of seeing the huge wall of water engulf the vessel.Here, there is no tension because the wave appears out of nowhere (I suppose that's why they call it ""rogue,"" but still ...). All of the same effects are in effect when the boat tumbles over - people and objects being thrown about, guys falling into skylights, water flooding various compartments, fire and explosions under water (don't ask), and various extras being crushed, drowned and/or roasted like peanuts. The one interesting scene is when the wave hits, there are a group of people washed out of the top deck's swimming pool.Like the '72 picture, the gang is plagued with many obstacles, a few interesting twists, some really claustrophobic and lung-aching moments (as much of their time is seemingly spent underwater), while a few of their number is quickly reduced by death. And there are certainly many more gruesome demises than in the first picture, to be sure. Plus, the FX are newer, although not necessarily better. Another thing that bothered me was the complete lack of character development. We're told that Lucas is a veteran (who works better alone), and that Russell was a firefighter (who thinks his daughter is too young for sex), but that's about it. Then there's Dreyfus' character calling his lover and crying, getting no message back and tossing his cell phone overboard. No explanation necessary from director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") about this whole storyline, I guess. Or the scene where Dreyfus is ordering a $5,000 bottle of wine for his dinner guests and mumbling about the ""war scare"" being over. What was he talking about?! Then there's the completely unnecessary inclusion of a drunk, male chauvinist Kevin ""Platoon"" Dillion, whose death is right of the ""Ha ha, he got what's coming to him,"" notebook.The sequence where the little boy is suddenly washed under some kind of wire enclosure also boggles the mind, since we know nothing of how he gets there, or how he is ultimately saved. It just happens. And, of course, as soon as the captain convinces everyone to stay where they are, we know that's the death knell for these unfortunate dopes.Besides the updated special effects, however, there is really no reason to see this one as long as the original still exists, so why bother? Just rent or buy the '72 version and get ready for some hokey lines, but an overall much better adventure than this sterile film can offer.",Poseidon
190,robertconnor,Drowned Turkey,1,2 April 2007,"When a tsunami capsizes a luxury liner, a small band of supposedly disparate passengers struggle to survive...Horrible remake of the 1972 classic, complete with interchangeable young brunette women, bland heroes (and heroics), annoying child and VERY little else. The script is beyond bad - this viewer felt sorry for the actors having to spout such crappy lines, and the casting choices are quite shocking, with utterly forgettable female characters and only Dreyfuss (hopefully being paid squillions for this garbage) offering a smidgeon of characterisation. It actually made me feel nostalgic for the tawdry 2005 TV remake... a repellent damp squib if ever there was one. AVOID!",Poseidon

192,A_Roode,Good flick but the quick pacing may actually have hurt it.,7,11 June 2006,"I've read a lot of devastating reviews from the mainstream critics where 'Poseidon' is concerned and, paradoxically, that piqued my interest enough to see if it was as bad as everyone claimed it was. I was pleasantly surprised by the film! This is the fourth incarnation of Paul Gallico's novel and I've seen every version so far. 'Beyond The Poseidon Adventure' and last year's TV version are far below both this and the original in terms of quality. The original has a certain cheesy yet endearing quality to it -- and a script that provides great drama. The big improvement that the producers of this new version would be able to add would be, I assume, a massive injection of high quality special effects.I believe they were successful on that front. I'd intended to see this on IMAX but had to settle for regular theatre instead. I'm tempted to go back. I was perfectly satisfied with the cgi work here and the stunt work was great. I'm thinking in particular of a scene where the sea crushes in through the glass and throws people around helplessly. That's all done seamlessly with wire work and it looks great on screen. The sets are really done well. What would any room look like if it was turned 360 degrees and then back 180? I really admired the chaos and the set design. Carnage and debris everywhere, bodies all over the place, some drowned or burned or both. Great stuff, HA! And perhaps it's my morbid sense of humour coming through but I laughed out loud when the ship turns over and from an underwater shot you see a ton of debris from the main deck of the ship ... including some unfortunate guests who float through the top of the shot. It was little touches to detail like that which kept me watching. From a technical standpoint I believe that this version of 'The Poseidon Adventure' is triumphant.Which brings me to the flaw of the film. The original had some pretty cornball effects. The way that it compensated was by having a great script full of dramatic conflict. The main conflict in both films is Ocean/Poseidon versus passengers trying to escape. There is little else from a conflict standpoint that goes anywhere in the new version. In the original you have two dominant alpha males with very different plans on how to escape. It is the conflict between the two of them and the deaths that follow from following one or the other that really draws you into the film. The two alphas in the current film mostly just tend to work together. A great source of potential tension is eliminated. In the original, passengers are given a very clear choice: stay in the ballroom and await rescue or attempt to escape with the refugees. The reverend and the captain make speeches pleading their cases and passengers decide what they want to do. In this version the captain does little more than shake his head disapprovingly and the passengers who DO leave mostly discover the chance to go by accident.Consider smaller areas where dramatic conflict seems to be introduced and then clipped for economy of script. Richard Dreyfuss is being pulled up an elevator shaft to safety by Josh Lucas. A crew member is with them and the support structure that they were on collapses. He grabs onto Dreyfuss and is starting to pull all three men to their certain deaths. Lucas tells Dreyfuss to kick the crewman off his leg so that two of three can be saved. Dreyfuss does. Later on he meets a woman who we in the audience knew was an acquaintance of the dead crewman. This back story is pretty much dropped. Imagine if Dreyfuss' character discovers that he is responsible for the death of her friend? Or, to make things interesting, her lover? Or what if she discovers the truth? When working together is the only way out, how do they function when they know the truth? Little character things like this are HUGE to making the audience care. In this film they are often avoided so that the easy road can be taken. Kevin Dillon is another example. His character is a real slime ball who has an obvious chip on his shoulder where Kurt Russell is concerned. Imagine if those two are trying to escape the ship but are completely at war with one another. Great drama! In this version, Kevin Dillon meets a grisly death almost as soon as the screenplay can arrange it. Kurt Russell says at one point ""There's nothing fair about who lives or dies."" How very true. Why then does the one character who seems totally irredeemable bite the dirt so early? Wouldn't it have been more poignant to have characters we like get killed off while the guy we hate lives on? These are just a few examples and there are more I could draw from. Sometimes the pacing of a film can be too quick and detrimental to the character aspects of a screenplay that make you care in the long run.That said, 'Poseidon' may find it's great crime was that it only managed to be a pretty good popcorn movie instead of the huge summer blockbuster that it's budget suggested it would be. If you're looking for decent special effects and an excuse to eat popcorn then you've got a winner. Apparently the director's cut on DVD will add quite a bit of footage to 'Poseidon' and perhaps it will address some of the problems I noticed. Either way, I still think that it is worth checking out.",Poseidon
193,LagerLagerLagerShouting,The Plot Holes Alone Would Alone Would Have Sank Poseidon.,5,30 April 2008,"It is true this film has some great special effects and pretty convincing sense of peril but this does not compensate for cardboard characters, a ridiculous plot which is full of holes and some truly awful dialogue. If the film had taken time to develop some sort of character development, whether it be back story or elements of conflict then it would have been more acceptable, but instead none of the characters really mattered, the only thing being believable is that they actually wanted to escape. But these stereotypical characters were shunned in place of action, which Wolfgang Peterson stages pretty capably, but none of that is believable either; last ditch escapes, convenient routes to freedom and the ability to hold breath longer than a scuba diver doesn't really add upto much. Entertaining in a way I suppose but lacking the true character and depth (no pun intended) of the original.5/10",Poseidon
194,emortland,A True Cinematic Test...,4,5 October 2020,"And the test is whether you can get through this film without pausing it because of its boring predictability. Mr Peterson is a great director, the effects are superbly done, but when IMDB tells you they spent $160 million for this back in 2006, you'll wonder if that money could have been better spent funding film school scholarships or school lunches or whatever.I don't think it matters if you haven't seen the original, but if you have, you'll quickly start playing the game of who's Gene Hackman, and Stella Stevens, etc. You'll find out quickly enough. Incidentally, the premise here is a giant cruise ship overturns at sea and ten people don't follow herd mentality so they're going to survive. But you have to guess which four will die in the process. Not that hard.All the main actors are cool, but you'll kind of sense they were here for the paycheck. Did they really think making this was a good idea? Maybe. Netflix should reward any loyal subscribers who actually survived watching this entire film. In one sitting.",Poseidon
195,cadfile,Gruesome and Shallow,5,14 May 2006,"I obviously have a bias because the original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is one of my favorite movies. I've loved it since seeing it for the first time at the drive-in back in 1972.Poseidon, the remake (and it is a remake), is a remake of the plot only. A cruise ship is hit by a rogue wave and capsizes and we follow a rag tag group in their efforts to find a way out of the upside down ship.The part that I keep coming back to is the lack of character development. Who are these people and why should I care if they live or die? We don't get the chance. The cast of characters are one dimensional and on occasion we find out some secret or skill never displayed before - all at contrived times.The original, and it was a trademark of all Irwin Allen disaster flicks, introduced you to the characters and you got to know them as much as possible before the disaster happened. You knew that the Rosen's were going to Israel to visit their grand children and you knew that Robin had explored the ship and knew where to try to get out, and Rev. Scott had issues with his faith and so on. You even had the subplot of the new owners forcing the SS Poseidon to make her last voyage light on ballast so it would be faster to the dry dock to be scrapped - that decision played a part in the capsizing and keeping it afloat upside down.That didn't happen in the remake and that is a shame. It made what could have been a good human movie into a mindless f/x flick. It got to the end when the survivors of the group got out of the ship and instead of feeling good about it, it left me indifferent.The photography and atmosphere were good. Director Wolfgang Petersen, famous for Das Boot and The Perfect Storm, knows his ships and water. Too bad he let the special effects and CGI overwhelm the film at the expense of the story.The only complaint I have about the photography is that is was too gruesome. It seemed any pan or shot of the ship had to include and focus on a dead body. It got to be too much. I just don't find watching people die to be entertainment.Of the cast I thought Josh Lucas, who played Dylan Johns, and Emmy Rossum, who played Jennifer Ramsey, had the best characters. I thought Richard Dreyfuss was underused and Kevin Dillon was a nice addition as the creepy Lucky Larry.I gave it a 5 for the direction.",Poseidon

197,LadyLiberty,"Poseidon is Saved by Brevity, Effects",6,14 May 2006,"Poseidon was the Greek god of the sea, and is thus a fitting name for a huge and luxurious ocean liner. She's on a New Year's cruise when the unexpected occurs at the height of the revelry: a rogue wave overtakes and capsizes her. Among those celebrating in the ship's ballroom and who survive the initial impact are Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), an itinerant gambler, and Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former fireman and the ex-mayor of New York City.While the ship's captain (Andre Braugher) tries to calm the hysterical survivors, Dylan is focused on nothing but getting out of the ship he knows is bound to sink. Ramsey, meanwhile, is more worried about his daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her boyfriend, Christian (Mike Vogel) who were ringing in the New Year one floor down from the ballroom in the ship's disco.Though Ramsey and Dylan met earlier in the evening as adversaries over a high stakes game of poker, they find themselves working together to rescue a young child, Conor (Jimmy Bennett) and calm his mother, Maggie (Jacinda Barrett). Once Maggie discovers that Dylan has a vague plan to escape the doomed ship, she demands to accompany him. Ramsey joins them with his own parallel agenda, as does the broken-hearted Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), who is all but suicidal until his life is threatened by the ship's mishap.With guidance from a ship's waiter, the small troupe defies the captain's orders to stay put and wait for rescue, and they begin their journey on the topsy turvy ship to reach the bottom by climbing up. The group faces terrible dangers from many sources ranging from shifting objects to broken electrical and gas lines, but they finally reach the disco to discover a scene of carnage there. The few survivors, however, do include Jennifer and an injured Christian as well as a young Hispanic woman named Elena (Mia Maestro).With a growing sense of urgency, the group now begins its climb in earnest, but they find their best laid plans thwarted at virtually every turn. It's in the face of their fears and the imminent threat of death, however, that some in the group find their finest moments. And as the great ship endures her death spasms, there are those who will, despite their courage or their need, die with her.Josh Lucas is always fun to watch simply because he's so good at being a lovable rogue. In Poseidon, he's all that, but he also shows the ability to convey true courage which isn't the lack of fear, but rather the ability to act despite being afraid. He's also got a future as an action star if he wants one  a few of his stunts are impressive to say the least! Kurt Russell is aging very well, showing a mature authority and capability here without pretending the physicality of a younger man.Emmy Rossum who was so brilliant in The Phantom of the Opera is fine here and so is Mike Vogel; Jacinda Barrett is completely convincing as the near hysterical young mother, though Jimmy Bennett could have been a bit less strident. Richard Dreyfuss, who has so often been cast as a slightly bumbling every man, is in fine form as the fussy Nelson. Mia Maestro is particularly effective. Her fears became my own despite the fact I'm not claustrophobic, and there were moments where I was literally short of breath as I watched her dragged (almost literally) kicking and screaming to the next challenge by her fellows.The script is, of course, somewhat predictable. Like Titanic, we all know what's going to happen. But reading the book or seeing the 1972 version (entitled The Poseidon Adventure) won't spoil this remake for you: The characters are all new as are their challenges, so you'll find the who-lives-and-who-dies suspense well in place. Though the characters aren't as developed as some of us might like them to be (okay, as I might like them to be), the fact that the movie is relatively short (98 minutes) and the action is non-stop actually make the film better in its genre.Director Wolfgang Peterson has a moderately uneven past, but with Troy (which I thought was a better effort than some critics did), The Perfect Storm, and Air Force One on his résumé, there's some unquestionable skill and experience he's able to lend to Poseidon; he moves things right along, and his tight edits and the focus on the terror of individuals is just terrific for adding to the overall effect of the movie. It probably goes without saying, but lest you wonder I'll say it anyway: yes, the special effects are awesome, and some of the stunts are pretty amazing, too.Poseidon is probably not everything the commercials and trailers would have you believe that it is, but it's pretty good none-the-less. If you want action, suspense, special effects, and human drama all rolled up into one neat hour-and-a-half long package, well, Poseidon will do the job for you. And while you may not relive moments of the film in your mind in the days to come, you'll almost certainly enjoy the ride as long as it lasts.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Poseidon is rated PG-13 for ""intense prolonged sequences of disaster and peril."" There are also some rather creative ways various people meet their deaths, and though it's typically not graphic, a few of them are pretty awful. As a result, I don't recommend this movie for kids under the age of 13 or 14 or so. But if the rest of you are just looking for a good time, Poseidon could fit your plans to a T.",Poseidon
198,Niro,There's Got To Be A Movie After,1,7 March 2007,"The better disaster flicks of the early '70s had a certain charm -- and a formula: 1. Mix some A-list actors (or fairly recent A-listers) with a few B-listers 2. Add a script which offered a small dose of character development {just enough to make you give a damn whatever horror was about to befall most of them) 3. Stir in a huge disaster -- a skyscraper on fire, a jumbo jet in danger, a meteor rapidly approaching Earth, a gigantic cruise ship destined to meet an equally gigantic wave 4. Special effects to match the disaster at hand This film, which my cable provider's guide called "" A worthy remake of the 1972 disaster epic, 'The Poseidon Adventure,'"" offers none of the first two listed above, which is a real problem.Utter no-names populate the film (with Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss attempting to provide the star power -- not very well), with virtually no character development whatsoever.In all fairness, how can you make us care about the 10 or so leads when the entire film comes in at just under 1:27 between the credits? Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"" and ""The Neverending Story"") should be ashamed of this dreck.Even the FX are suspect (and a lot of CG) -- the initial wave hitting, and the subsequent terror in the ballroom, with all of the story lines crashing together, is a far cry from Irwin Allen's thrilling '72 original.Not that the first was a great film by any means but come on -- no Christmas tree rescue?

199,HBeachBabe,$140 million and it looks like a 3 camera soap opera???,4,4 November 2006,"The first thing I noticed about the latest Posiedon Adventure remake was that the opening CGI fly-by of the ship looked too clean, too plastic. Even with the matted in jogging Josh Lucas, the shot has no weight or sense of reality. Perhaps it was the DVD transfer, but their was no sense of scope or depth. It looked flat and shot-on-video. Unlike the similar shot in Titanic, this shot moved too fast. Filming miniatures or CGI requires rather detailed calculations to get a shot that duplicates what a ""real"" shot would and should feel like. This one didn't have that. OK, just a fancy opening CGI shot right? It'll get better, right? Wrong. Almost immediately, I got the feeling I was watching a day-time soap opera. The video quality looked just that - video quality, not film. At first, I thought maybe the film was done Sky Captain or Sin City style, with real actors against digital sets, so disconnected were they from what was around them. The floating camera, meant, I think, to duplicate reality-show TV giving you a ""real, you-are-there quality"" instead struck as more in line with day time soap opera style, with too-perfect stedicam work and television style editing. Only later in the film, during some of the underwater action sequences was there a hint of film grain, making this look like it was made with real film cameras as opposed to digital video. Not enough to save the look of the film though.Unfortunately,(or perhaps fortunately) I had a hard time getting beyond this issue. Not that it matters as the ""story"" was soulless. Whatever appeal the novel or the original film had are cruelly stripped away, leaving us with fake plastic people in a fake plastic boat. Rather than caring about any of them, we were playing ""name the next victim"" and not really lamenting the death of any of them, right up to the predicable ""noble sacrifice"" near the end. (A scene done much better in Armageddon (bet you never thought you'd hear those words!)) We only made one wrong re: who would die due to the expectation that a character who kills another to survive early on would have to pay for that decision later, but redemption (or karma) never came.Even the much-lauded CGI effects here aren't really all that impressive, knowing they are CGI. The focus is so much on explosions, flash fires and large parts of the ship crashing done, killing scores of people at once, that there is a sense of disconnect. It's all a big video game ride. Unlike the original where we see individual people struggle to stay alive as the ship turns over and we feel for the unknown guy who falls to his death into the skylight, here we just get overwhelmed and marvel at the technicians who build the collapsing elevators.Wolfgang Peterson used to be a top flight director (Das Boot, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One) but then he discovered digital effects and has allowed his latest films to become overwhelmed with massive visuals that crush whatever cardboard characters he has running around (Perfect Storm, Troy and now this ultimate disaster, Posiedon.)",Poseidon
200,jmupton2003,"Not bad at all, there have been worse remakes....",6,21 May 2007,"Whilst not holding a candle to the far superior original in terms of script, plot and acting, this remake of the classic 1972 'The Poseidon Adventure' is at least watchable which is more than can be said for a lot of the seemingly endless tide of remakes hitting cinemas these days.The characters (for want of a better word) are a bit thin and cardboard and the plot really is just a long string of reasonably predictable set pieces but at least it entertains. The best bit is the special effects which are absolutely top drawer. For some reason Hollywood can do some really good FX and CGI when it comes to boats and the CGI rendition of the Poseidon itself in the opening scene is incredibly well done.Top marks also to the Producers for making sure the Poseidon is a proper British flagged Southampton registered ship and not some Americanised tub.Much like its predecessor though I fully expect this version to become stable Bank Holiday afternoon television filler material for the next twenty years.

Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell share the top billing and the excitement begins within 5 minutes after the movie begins! No half hour building characters here; it's wham, bam thank you ma... well, you get my drift!

Josh Lucas is an anomaly that tells another major character just before the ship capsizes that he's a professional gambler. Who cares? It's about survival and wildness!!

Don't listen to that ridiculous 5.6 you'll see if you scroll up above my comment a bit. Poseidon is a true Hollywood legend folks, and that's the honest to God truth! The acting was superb in this movie! I was hanging on the edge of my seat for the whole movie, then I fell off, if you know what I mean. It's so good! The special effects are spectacular! There was only one flaw though. The director didn't do much with the ending. It was the same as The Poseidon Adventure, except in Poseidon they jumped out of the propeller shafts and then they floated on an orange inner tube that I forgot where it came from. Then helicopters flew in and rescued them. The director could have at least let the characters who *lived* the disaster tell what it was like for them, for example, ""I will never forgot the day that Poseidon sank beneath the waves,"" etc., etc., etc.Otherwise, everything was simply wonderful in this spectacular remake. The acting, the music, the effects, the directing, the writing, the editing, the intensity, everything was awesome! Richard Dreyfuss seems to appear out of nowhere since he did Jaws. I could barely recognize him he was so grown up! Look for a half-bald, white-haired man with a very nice cell phone. That's him. Josh Lucas was the star of this picture, and he did an excellent job in acting. Emmy Rossum is back from The Day After Tomorrow and The Phantom of the Opera.

204,JWJanneck,Cr*p.,1,17 May 2006,"There is something I really liked about the movie---the title sequence is a nice virtual tour of the outside of that magnificent ship.And that's it. The rest of the movie is completely useless. The movie rushes through the build-up---we get a few minutes of happy-time, which we know is only put in place to be crushed violently, a few token conflicts (father-daughter BS, some heartache by a gay guy, ...), a few token politically correct angles (the gay character, black captain), then boom comes the big wave, capsizes the damn ship, lotsa people die, lotsa stuff gets smashed, and bang, we have the setup for the rest of the movie.At that point, the movie is effectively over. If you have seen the original, you know what happens. And if you have any idea of today's Hollywood, you know *how* it will happen. To wit: A group of characters are fighting their way out of the ship. They must pass a bunch of obstacles, some of them die. You can pretty much guess who, too. One guy is practically set up as an asshole just to be offed right away, and of course kids, mothers, and young girls are immortal in such movies. That leaves a small handful of question marks, but in order for this to keep you interested in the movie you'd have to care the least for any of these people.And I certainly didn't. I was looking at my watch.The one slightly surprising moment is when the hero tells the gay guy (who was holding onto him in an elevator shaft) to shake some third guy, who was hanging off the gay guy's leg, off, because otherwise both of them would have died. He does that, the other guy falls and gets squashed by the elevator. A moment of exchanging guilty looks, cut, off to the next obstacle.I wasn't necessarily a great fan of the original---it was cheesy, and all in all not really a terribly good movie. But it had some 3D characters instead of cardboard cutouts, played by actual actors (apologies to Dreyfus---he did with his part what he could, but his part was junk) rather than models, and it was paced to allow the audience to get involved with the characters and care about them.I guess nothing but over-designed bubblegum nonsense was to be expected from Petersen, and that is what he delivered.",Poseidon
205,DesertDogMedia,Poseidon,7,9 July 2014,"Title: PoseidonCondensed Storyline: A bunch of people are on a cruise ship for a relaxing holiday, until a tidal wave hits the ship and knocks it onto its side. A group of survivors must than find a way out before the boat sinks. Notable Acting: One thing I like about this cast is that everyone seems expendable, but in a good way. Everyone seems like they could be killed off regardless of their importance to the plot. This also seems to take effect very early in the movie with the chef getting killed. As fake as the chef's acting seems to be, his expression of terror looks genuine for the scene when he dies. I enjoyed most of the characters, everyone acted real and had believable dialog. I can't remember their names, but I liked them at least. Noticeable Camera work: 180º establishing shot of the ship, flying into standard establishing one take shot. Birds eye shot for the lift shaft scene.Graphics: CGI ship isn't half bad for the first shot. Everything else is practical effects. Incorrect Science: When the ship capsized, gravity would make everything fall into piles, not get spread out like shown. Air ducts are not designed to be able to hold the weight of a person, so holding the surviving cast is impossible. The ship is in the north Atlantic on new years day, this would mean the water is very cold and considering they only have normal clothes on and not exposure suits, they should be too cold to to function and suffering from hypothermia. You may think the wave that hit the ship is impossible, but you would be amazed because rogue tidal waves can reach up to 70 feet. Overall Feel: The size of the movie is one thing which I enjoy, it looks big with its sets of CGI. It almost reminds me of a platform-esk video game. It is also good at playing the agoraphobia part while mixing it with hydrophobia, those are the fear of being in a situation where escape will be difficult and the other is fear of water. So if you have these fears, you will not want to be watching this movie. If you want another fear inducing scene there is the air ducts seen for those who have claustrophobia or a fear of drowning. But in saying that, the whole movie is a phobia for those who fear drowning. We also end the movie with an unsuspected heroic sacrifice.",Poseidon

207,Jinn,Poseidon himself cannot sink this ship. Oh yeah?,4,5 January 2008,"He sunk the movie too. I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I mean a movie named after an Ancient Greek God has got to be good, right? DISAPPOINTED!!! It started well. The sets and effects were really were excellent and believable, however the characters were boring and UN-engaging (despite the actors doing the best they could with such a watery script). Elena and the daughter were possibly the best of the characters. I also liked Stacey and the Captain and they at least died with honour.The wave looked awesome (though should have been higher). The movie soon started to become tedious and mind-numbingly predictable. After seeing many a 'disaster movie' I wanted something with a little more effort in the 'interesting twist' department. I mean if they all died or there was more about the intriguing wave - that would have at least have been something different. And the ending was so unbelievable ... Oh look! A pretty flare! ... And they found the tiny raft in a jiffy - when they couldn't find a humongous titanic belly-up ship?! (Which they would have seen way before it sunk had they been that close...) I watched this movie on DVD and spent more quality time cutting out pictures for my treasure map... It also annoyed me to no end how the two young women were constantly blithering and shrieking, not knowing what to do and clinging onto their men. Isn't this supposed to be a *modern* version? I felt for Elena when she died although I'd have liked to see the girls show some initiative and backbone rather than some sexist producer's fantasy of rescuing helpless damsels in distress. Gods, even in Poseidon's own time - 3000 years ago that is, there were warrior women! Go the Amazons! I give it 4 stars, but only for the wave premise and the upside-down ship effect. I would have loved to have known more about the wave ... Where it came from ... how it was formed ... Where it was headed. I thought the movie would be less on the clichéd 'disaster movie drama' and more on the wave. I actually thought the people would be rescued part way through the movie and then the rest of the movie focusing on this awesome wave and what caused it. That would have been *so* much more interesting!!! Was it headed to land? Was the wave a natural phenomenon, or an unnatural one?... And if it was unnatural, then who, rather than what caused it and for what purpose? Was the wave even supernatural? I mean they could have done **so** much with the wave storyline. Sadly, the wave's one big moment in the movie came and went and it was never mentioned again. I thought it was the best actor in the movie. Certainly had more character depth. If ""Wave"" stars in any more movies, he should ask for more screen time. And a better agent ;) And it wouldn't be the first time the Gods sunk a big ship named after them when the mortals became too big for their boots and insulted them with their audacity. Remember the Titanic? Poseidon sunk that too... Though I think he rather liked the movie :)",Poseidon

And the ship is on the other foot. From the starts a tensive escape from suspended ship.Acting was great. Kurt Russell role was the best of he's entire life. Ever Fergies debut was smashing good.

210,KillerCadugen,Shameful,3,15 May 2006,"If you watched this movie while half asleep, it would appear to be a thrilling adventure movie. But if you are too focused, the numerous flaws and problems with the script become readily apparent. This is the story of a luxury cruise ship capsized by a gigantic rogue wave and thus begins a fight for survival as a small band of people try to climb ""up"" to the bottom of the ship to escape before the whole thing sinks. Typical Hollywood blockbuster fare, but the problems begin right away when the script telegraphs who is going to die and then contrives rescue situations (come on - a little boy is going to wander away on a capsized ship? And then get stuck inside a metal cage? While the water is quickly rising? Jeepers!). The Kurt Russell character then has to become a hero by swimming 150 feet (or was it yards) on one breath to turn off the ship propellers, an operation he would not be able to do if the ship was upright, everything was dry, and he had all the time in the world. But, lucky for him, it was so simply marked. And then, as the group is running out of time, the seams of the ship burst and water begins shooting through the bulkhead ... even though that portion of the ship is ABOVE the water level and, even if it were submerged, pressure would be high enough to burst bulkhead seams designed to be hundreds of feet underwater. This whole movie left me feeling like I got ripped off. Pick up the original and watch that instead. Watching this would be a big mistake.",Poseidon
211,medic249a2,A thrilling ride!,7,12 May 2006,"With so many remakes being made of 1970's classics today, I was a little suspect of this one when I walked in, despite having been impressed by the theatrical trailers. However, I was pleasantly surprised at what they'd done with this one based on Paul Gallico's novel & Irwin Allen's screenplay 'The Poseidon Adventure'.As anyone who has seen the original knows, the story is based on a huge cruise ship - the Poseidon - that is knocked over at midnight on New Year's Eve by a giant rogue wave. Most of the crew & passengers are killed outright, but a few remain alive in the ballroom. Of these survivors, a handful decide to try to make their way to the surface - which is now the hull of the ship - against the captain's admonishments. They must fight their way past flash fires, falling debris, unclimbable stairs, and the ever-present threat of flooding. Eventually the passengers & crew who remain behind will drown, as the windows, with hundreds of pounds of water pressure against them, give way & flood the ballroom where the party was being held. Will the handful of people who escaped death in that ballroom manage to get to the surface? Conspicuous by their absence are several characters from the original, most notable Rev. Scott, the Rogos, and the Rosens. However, this did not detract from the film - in fact, I think this movie tried more to be its own film than strictly a remake of Irwin Allen's. Also, such technologies that didn't exist at the time of the original had to be integrated into this one - such as GPS tracking.I'm often skeptical of remakes of the 1970's classics, but I did find more & more that these films try to be their own, rather than a true remake. This makes them stand out from the ones that inspired them. This one is worth seeing at least once, but I will likely see it again.",Poseidon
212,MovieHead123,Could have been good,4,18 November 2020,"Started off good. However, it was a bit misleading and very frustrating. At first I thought Elena and Dylan were going to wind up together because there was some flirtation during their first interaction with each other. That came to rest as soon as Dylan meets and flirts with Conor's mom. Also, I thought it was pretty messed up how Richard shook off Marco, even though Marco was nice enough to let him go first. I get that Richard did what he had to do, but he didn't even seem remorseful or at all sad or bothered by it. Another thing that bothered me is that Robert went below the water to reverse/turn off the propellers and died. He could've let his future son in law go who was an experienced swimmer for years and probably would've survived.",Poseidon
213,filmfan92,"""Poseidon"" Cruises Along Swimmingly",8,14 September 2006,"Poseidon wasn't exactly I film I was gearing up to love. After all, it was the year's biggest BO flop, starred several ""B"" actors, and was a remake of of the campiest films of the seventies. Boy, was I surprised.The story is a simple one: A ""rogue wave"" flips a ship over, up becomes down, and the survivors have to escape through the bottom (or is it the top...?) before the the Poseidon sinks. However, this film is more enjoyable then it has any right to be, and the reason can be whittled down to two words; Wolfgang. Petersen. From ""Das Boot"" to ""The Perfect Storm"", Petersen is the master, hands down, of sea epics. So it is no surprise he brings his usual grandeur to the proceedings. Petersen sees this film as what it is: An eye-popping popcorn picture that makes us all feel glad we have a dry place to sleep. ""Poseidon"" is so fun because it never truly takes itself seriously. The cast of characters are amusingly oddball; the young lovers (the beautiful Emmy Rossum and newcomer Mike Vogel), the former Mayor (Kurt Russell, back in a big way), the sexy gambler (The talented Josh Lucas), the single mom (Jacinda Barett), the gay wiseguy (Richard Dreyfuss!), the ship troublemaker (Mia Maestro), and the drunk dude (Kevin Dillon). But really and truly, the best character in this film is the ship. The scene in which the Poseidon is violently flipped over is a grandiose symphony and sound and fury, and it could compete with Titanic for the best ship-disaster sequence ever. This movie is one helluva ride, and one of the summer' best.",Poseidon
214,AlienByChoice,I fell asleep,2,4 June 2006,"Let's start with the good points, shall we? There is one - CGI. That's about it.Bad points.1) Characters. Let's see - Kurt Russell is an ex-firefighter turned the Mayor of New-York turned billionaire, who is a poker pro... You catch the drift, don't you? The rest of them are just as believable.2) Technical goofs. There are so many of them. This is a technological disaster movie, couldn't they hire some knowledgeable tech-consultants?.3) The plot. There is none. No main plot, no subplot, the whole thing feels like a platform-based boring computer game.4) Acting. The male leads are trying hard, but there is really only so much they can do. The female leads were so annoying, that I got the ""Titanic"" feeling - please, spare us the misery and drown, and the sooner - the better.5) Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas can't really sing. They should have done a voice-over.I tried to keep this comment short and to the point; something the Poseidon fails at achieving. Give it a miss. You owe yourself that much.",Poseidon
215,www-jats,Coll movie but not real,8,30 January 2011,"Especially one that sinks Titanic in special effects...This is a remake of The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Before you jump on the bandwagon and start bashing it on this basis alone, keep it mind that the original film was not exactly a masterpiece. It was a film that sacrificed scientific reality to propel an inane plot, filled with one-dimensional characters and compensated for it with action-overload. Poseidon is exactly the same -- ridiculous plot, intrepid characters and big slice of adventure. What is different in this version is the masterful CGI. This is a perfect time to remake a film like this (much better than in 1972) -- just go overboard with special effects and no one will notice the flawed writing (which is basically a sketchbook mess).This is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience. I'll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheese ball line (""Where is the disco?"" ""Why, you feel like dancing now?""), but I set its cringe worthy dialog aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie. The giant tidal wave capsizing the luxury liner Poseidon would take care of that, leaving only a small group of people fighting to reach the top and get out.Another thing, besides special effects, that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Make no mistake however, these characters are still dumb to the core, getting by on lucky circumstances, occasional heroic feats and conveniently appearing objects and hatches – you've seen it all before, but damn, this is sensationally quality action.Overall, Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fast-paced as any action film you'll see. It features mind-numbing special effects, overdoses of excitement and just typical Wolfgang Peterson overkill. It definitely won't disappoint you if you're looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks. I'd even happily sit through this experience again.6.5/10",Poseidon

However, I think it was another Hollywood forgettable thing. I have not seen the original though.--- SPOILERS ---The greatest thing is the giant wave and when the ballroom is flood, but in general the film is very predictable and you can guess from the start who will die and who will not. It is quite obvious that the wacko/drunk and the coward/scared of the group will not stay long. It is also obvious that the little boy and the hero will never die.There is a situation that do not match to me: When the boy appeared suddenly in a cage. How the hell did he get there and why? He was always with mom but then he appeared trapped. There is also a stupid situation that shows the stupidity of the group. They knew Elena was extremely scared. How can you leave the scared one at the end of the tail when they are swimming under water? It is obvious she could have a problem!I did not like the acting in general, except Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell. Josh Lucas is a good actor, unfortunately all the movies I watched featuring him were forgettable except A Beautiful Mind, where he is not the main character though.Special effects and CGI were great in this movie. However I think the disasters looked quite similar to Titanic.At the end, it would have been good to know how the people would continue their lives, but it seems the screen writers did not want to focus too much in their lives actually, and this made the movie sank (just like the ship), because somehow you do not identify with any of the characters.",Poseidon
218,matjusm,"Poseidon- the ship that delivers, somewhat",7,17 June 2006,"Yet another big budget remake, the kind that these past few years have been filled with, this one being based on the 70s disaster classic The Poseidon Adventure.The premesis is simple- a luxury cruise liner on new years eve gets struck by a rogue wave and a group of survivors bond together to find a way out.The film starts off with a string of introductions to all the main characters who we will later see trying to escape the ship. There is Kurt Russell, his daughter played by Emmy Rossum and her boyfriend Mike Vogel, Josh Lucas, Jacinda Berret and Jimmy Bennet (mother and son), Richard Dreyfuss and a few others. Following the capsizing, this group of people decides to ignore the captain's orders and starts making their way up to the surface (which is of course the bottom of the ship actually). Leading the group are our main heroes Russel and Lucas.The journey isn't easy and its never sure whether they'll make it or die just around the next curve. Every advancement brings about a new obstacle and never is there a 'safe' feeling. But this is where the clichés start coming in, just like the ocean water flowing into the ship. There are annoying melodramatic subplots everywhere, people having phobias, being scared and saying that they just can't do it. Random explosions happen throughout the ship, hardly any of which are blessed with an explanation. And more than just a couple of times does it happen that right when they're in a perilous situation it just so happens that one of them happens to be an expert on a subject that'll end up saving them. Not that unrealistic though but clichéd nonetheless.The technical aspects are however the film's strongest part. The Poseidon is beautiful and the sets are grand. Wolfgang Petersen does a very competent job of directing. Along with cinematographer John Seale, he manages to create a sense of chaos without ever shaking the camera so much that it feels like they were filming during an earthquake. The special effects (and I was glad to see that a lot of stuff was done for real with real stunt men) and CGI are as good as they get and finally they had managed to create things (such as the exterior shots of the ship and its surroundings) that I could buy as something real and not just very good computer graphics.Good but not great. 7/10",Poseidon

I also believe that Kurt Russell is one of the most entertaining actors of our generation. Because of the aforementioned reasons, I was fully excited to see ""Poseiden"".While Poseiden is not as good as Perfect Storm, or Das Boot, it is a highly entertaining movie. While the old disaster movies spent over a third of the movie with small dialog to introduce you to the characters; Poseiden just kicks the movie into full blown adventure. A little dialog, and interaction, would have made you care more about the characters--but then the critics would have complained that the movie was too long. I am sure that Wolfgang learned that too much characterization can hurt a film (Troy) and decided to go right for the throat with Poseiden.The acting is better than previous commentary will lead you to believe. Remember that this is a disaster movie and not a Shakespeare production. Russell, Lucas and Rossum give quality performances (for an action film) that are believable and give you people to care about during their ordeals.I gave Poseiden a 7 only because of the shortened movie.

While I enjoyed the film it was nothing great and I've seen similar films that were much better.Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas do well in this film for what it's worth. Unfortunately the film never quite explains why the two are rivals. In fact, character development in this film is lacking badly. I understand that in a film such as this one the special effects are the real star, but I still would have liked to have gotten more insight on the characters. Ten minutes into the film the tidal wave hits inexplicably and completely cuts off any backstory. The characters are pretty much interchangeable and ""cookie-cut"". We have the selfish guy who becomes a hero, the protagonist father-type, the heroine daughter, her misunderstood love interest, the single mom and the brat kid. Of course, nowadays we also have the obligatory and unnecessary gay character.***MAJOR SPOILERS*** One problem I had was the behavior of a few characters. After all they'd been through, why did the stupid kid go exploring at the time he did? Of COURSE he gets lost, which is why the kids are usually put in these kind of flicks. I also wonder how he managed to get behind a steel grating that had no access.When Kurt Russell's character is trying to shut off the engine he sees the broken emergency stop, then is pounding on all of the computers and machinery in desperation... then suddenly as he dies he calmly hits the correct button? That was just ridiculous. It didn't help that his entire death was similar to Bruce Willis' death in Armageddon.What was the point of the hispanic woman? It seemed like her whole purpose in the film was to do nothing worth mentioning then die.Emmy Rossum was great in Phantom of the Opera. It seemed a waste to have Fergie singing when Rossum was in the film.****END OF SPOILERS**** All in all, this film is never boring and is a good film to take your whole family to.

222,guanche,A terrible bore that unwittingly offers a window into the moral bankruptcy of our time.,1,31 May 2006,"This excuse for a film has no plot or anything resembling a story line. The characters are smarmy little nonentities who are so lacking in substance that one can't even dislike them. There are some good special effects, but even these quickly wear thin and lose their shock effect. After a while, the viewer feels as if he's watching a home movie of a nightmarish amusement park water ride.The one worthwhile, yet negative aspect of this film is it's portrayal of how selfish and egocentric our society has become. Sure, the original version's stereotypical characters, cornball scripting and preachy, self righteous tone were a bit tedious. BUT, Gene Hackman's charismatic clergyman character tried to convince the others to join him in attempting escape through the upside down hull of the ship. In this version, the character who hits upon the idea (a gambler) indirectly suggests it to another within earshot. These two then embark upon the mission with their loved ones, making no attempt at sharing their insight or convincing the others to follow.An absolute waste as entertainment, but a concise, albeit unintentional, statement of much that is wrong with our time.",Poseidon

We do not see two main leaders fighting for the ""top"". In the original, you had some tender,beautiful moments that this film lacked.

Russell and Lucas make up for only about half a Hackman each but unfortunately the sum of the parts do not add to the total. Credibility goes out the window the moment Lucas jumps into burning waters in a bungee like fashion, surviving without a scratch. Didn't an identically dangerous fall kill Gene Hackman in the first version ? Inconsistencies abound: Russell and Lucas seem to know everything about the ship, including where the controls to stop the propeller are and how only by filling a room with water will open a hatch. A drowing kid is inexplicably rescued by Lucas. Russell drowns and then comes back to life in order to push the controls to stop the propeller. I guess he was doomed the moment he showed his disaprovement for his daughter's boyfriend. The best stuff in the original is thrown away: the Christmas tree, Shelly Winters getting stuck everywhere, Leslie Nielsen's unforgettable frightening look at the coming wave. The heroes don't even care about inviting any of the other survivors along. To top things off, the moment they escape and jump into the ocean, there is a conveniently sized raft less than 20 feet away and they don't even have to wait more than 30 seconds until 2 helicopters arrive and find them.

225,nived84,Poseidon is a watchable clunky piece of Hollywood cheese,5,13 May 2006,"Wolfgang Petersen has directed a number of big budget thrillers, including Air Force One, In the Line of Fire, Troy, The Perfect Storm and Das Boot, and now he's made another action-thriller of epic proportions; Poseidon, a remake of 1972's The Poseidon Adventure. It's Titanic, but without the sappy romance, and only lasting a mere one hundred minutes, which actually sounds good on paper, but unfortunately it isn't all that great in it's execution. Sure the special effects are pretty good, and the film does have some nice set pieces here and there, but overall this film is very routine and loaded with clichés. Poseidon is a big clunky piece of Hollywood cheese, nothing more, and nothing less.The film doesn't really have much character development. Petersen is in such a hurry to deliver a simple piece of escapist thrills and excitement he just skips through it all just to get to the sequence in which a massive rouge wave that dramatically capsizes the giant ship, causing numerous deaths from explosions, impalements, drownings and electrocutions. This epic set piece is quite amazing and really exciting, and it's easily the best moment in the entire film. Unlike last year's King Kong, Peter Jackson knew that we needed in grow into our characters and then drop them into a nightmare in which they have to survive, but here we seem to be learning more about the characters only after they are placed into jeopardy. This is not the way you do a disaster film; even The Day After Tomorrow did this more appropriately. The characters are clichéd, and not very interesting or original. Some of them you really could care less about, and Andre Braugher as the witless Captain and Kevin Dillon as drunk gambler couldn't die soon enough in this movie.There's only a few characters that you almost care about, the father and daughter (played by Kurt Russell and the adorable Emmy Rossum) who seem to be at each others throats for the majority of the film, a mother and her young son (played by Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett) and a man who's only looking out for himself (played well by Josh Lucas) and reluctantly becomes the leader of a small group of survivors, trying to find a way up and out of the sinking ship. One of the survivors is a somewhat shaky homosexual played by Richard Dryfuss, why his character is a homosexual I don't know, but I do know that it doesn't add anything relevant to the story. Supposed, just by chance he's an engineer and is only important to the plot so he can deliver one line of dialogue about how ships like the one they're on weren't designed to float upside down, but later on none of his engineering skills and knowledge pays off for anything. Apparently a 140 million dollar budget can buy you some big name actors, some massive sets, but sadly it cannot provide a decent script.This isn't as exciting as Air Force One, or as dramatically well scripted as The Perfect Storm, and in the end one has to be somewhat disappointed at the end result of Poseidon, even if you watch it just for the special effects and action sequences (of which there are many), you'll probably still feel a little let down. Why couldn't they have just added an additional 30 or 40 minutes to develop some people that we really care about? Poseidon is worth seeing on the big screen once it comes to your local dollar theater or if you want to it'll certainly make for an decent DVD rental, but this is an easily passable adventure, running high on action and suspense, but very low on emotional heart and interesting characters. I'm disappointed in Petersen with this one. It almost makes me wish that Roland Emmerich had directed it, because at least he knows how to use clichés a little better.",Poseidon
226,killbill_28,Fair!!!,4,31 May 2006,"I watched this movie at a preview screening last night and I was very disappointed with this movie. I love the 1972 classic, there's nothing in this movie that relates it with the original. Its got different characters, music, etc. I'm still trying to figure out why they used a cruise ship to portray the S.S Poseidon. Everybody know's that the ship in the original was on its last voyage and heading very slowing to Greece because it was ""top heavy"". Really I think a cruise ship could pick up the giant wave on there radar with all the computers and stuff they have, giving them time to take action. (What caused the giant wave?) In the original it was caused by an Earthquake. It doesn't say in this one how the wave was formed.At least they keep the story to ""New Years Eve"" and only a handful of people make it out (some die on the way I won't say who). The special effects in this movie are good but could have been better, you can tell that shots were CGI effects in some shots. Even when the ship gets capsized it happens very quick and its all over in about 1 minute. All so the ship gets capsized in the first 14 minutes of the film, most of the start is the ship sailing at sea, Kurt Russell fighting with his daughter and Josh Lucus playing poker. It needed more character in the characters of the film, they should have introduce the characters better in the film.In the original this ship doesn't get capsized till 35 minutes into the film and the main characters are really introduce good and you know what they like doing and how they act. And the capsizing of the ship is slower and more thrilling. This 3rd remake of the great Poseidon tale is fair. Only see if your a die hard Poseidon fan, Otherwise save your money and wait for the DVD release.",Poseidon
227,moviegeek310,Poseidon Sinks,4,28 June 2006,"This film came out in the first part of May, and I kept putting off seeing it until now. And I have to say it is good in a way, and horrible in another. ""Poseidon"" is your typical disaster film; great effects, bad dialogue, super suspenseful, and dreadful acting. So as a disaster movie it delivers, on a regular film scale, it's just bad.For those who don't know the plot, or haven't seen the 1972 ""Poseidon Adventure"" film then it's simply this: Boat tips over, people try to escape, everyone dies, the end. Yeah, pretty depressing. Disaster movies always are. Expect to bite your finger nails down to nothing, not have a smile on your face, because this is one of the most intense disaster films ever. I think at times it's unnecessarily so, like when a dumb kid suddenly goes missing for no apparent reason. Lots of stuff like that happens.And like I said before, the acting stinks, especially by Josh Lucas who always had a very bizarre look on his face, and the dialogue was written by monkeys. But the F/X at times wowed me, then at other times made the characters look like rubber. You'd think with a 140 million dollar budget the filmmakers could afford to make believable CG people. The tipping of the ship scene was a spectacle to behold. Now that scene was amazing. Director Wolfgang Petersen is no stranger to CG heavy films either, having made the ""Perfect Storm"" and ""Troy"". I bet the props department had a ball with this film too. I imagine the conversation telling them what to do going something like this, ""Find whatever you can and throw it all in pile and make it look like something."" Then the single word reply by the prop guys was, ""Sweet!"" Continuity wise though there are lots of problems, but that's to be expected when everything is supposed to be upside down.Overall, excellent edge-of-your-seat thriller, but horrid film. Prepare to be shocked both ways.I give the disaster part 10 out of 10.I give the film part 4 out of 10.""Poseidon"" is rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of disaster and peril.Brian Ledtke, 16, lives in Thomas Township",Poseidon
228,orourkec-292-269155,"Flawed, but still worth a few well deserved praises",6,28 December 2014,"Poseidon is a fairly watchable though forgettable film which fails to accomplish its full purpose: unfortunately its script lacks enough strength and the movie doesn't viscerally (even if it is intellectually) feel like a ride in hell as the director puts it in inside the DVD's special features I've seen and listened to. However, the movie's obstacles such as SPOILERS! SPOILERS! the giant oil leak which turns water into a huge fountain-shaped fire or the falling elevator in fire or even the accidental electrocution scene are truly well made ones and can't be ignored. Fortunately as well the movie is suspenseful at times and viscerally and tenderly felt as well. Poseidon is furthermore exceptionally well filmed at its opening scene and well composed too. Still, unlike the Perfect Storm the film's positive points don't make up for its flaws. My rating: 6.2/10",Poseidon

230,tripxyde,"Thrilling, But Not Unforgettable",3,13 May 2006,"POSEIDON is the remake of the 1972 classic POSEIDON ADVENTURE. I usually find disaster movies boring. I also thought that this remake was needless, considering how good the original version was. And Wolfgang Petersen's last big movie ""Troy"" failed miserably to amuse me. But thank God for the money and the time that I spent for this movie, I was wrong. Wolfgang Petersen's POSEIDON is teeth-gritting big bag of explosive and massively destructive suspense. Like most disaster movies, POSEIDON carries with it a depressing factor. Understandably, the kind of carnage involved in a disaster movie is totally different from the kind of carnage we see in films like Godzilla, for example. But the degree of drama and dangerous tension is radiant in this film that you actually feel the characters' sense of futility and their relentless effort to survive.The movie does not dilly dally on needless introductory drama, its characters are simple enough that it needs not delve into the layers to understand who or what each character is. the story goes headlong into the disaster itself and into the horrendous experience that the characters go through. As the story progresses, only then do we get a deeper understanding of who each character is. The action sequences that involve an obstacle to survive or to escape from are breath-gripping suspenseful. There were moments when you would hold your breath along with the characters of this movie.The only problem with POSEIDON is its simplicity and the cliché brand that it obviously carries with it. The original POSEIDON ADVENTURE was phenomenal during its time that movies of the same theme copied its style endlessly, so much so that it has become a standard cliché. One which this remake is branded with. From sequence progression, to pacing, to character variation, these movies seem to have a ready-made template for the film-makers to fill. In a malicious-thinking point of view, the ""homage to the original movie"" seemed to be an excuse to execute the clichés. But dissection of the movie aside, the film does connect with the audience in terms of drama, tension, and thrills, whether it is a cliché or not. Thankfully, the execution of the storyline lets you forget this flaw. After all, films are made to be enjoyed, and not be dissected.",Poseidon
231,royale_w_cheez44,Hugely Entertaining,8,6 July 2006,"I went into this film with really low expectations. Bad reviews, a disastrous opening week, yada yada yada. To my pleasant surprise, Poseidon was worth my $5.50. It's a near perfect summer popcorn flick: big budget, amazing visuals, and excitement that doesn't quit.But you'd think that with a bigger budget they could have gotten a better script. After some cringe-inducing lines, very undeveloped characters, and a gaping (and annoying) plot hole or two, you eventually just shut off your brain and go along with the ride. Despite its shortcomings, Poseidon is incredibly well done. The visual effects are absolutely stunning and the underwater cinematography is gorgeous and scarily effective.Did I mention that the movie is a blast to watch? The excitement kicks in immediately (at the expense of plot, but, oh well) and the body count is through the roof! If the writers did one thing right, it was create an suspenseful atmosphere with a few surprises. With characters dropping like flies, the tension is at a boiling point for most of the film. It's really intense and incredibly fun to watch.But it's really a shame that this movie is failing. It certainly delivers all of the goods that a summer movie should. Wolfgang Peterson certainly did a great job of creating an intense but bleak adventure that is terrific entertainment, if nothing else.",Poseidon
232,newfiesailor,Formulaic but entertaining.,7,9 August 2006,"Nothing breakthrough here. Action thriller with all the stereotypical, cliché scenes and characters. However it still manages to entertain due to moving and original action sequences enhanced by great computer effects.There are a number of crazy mistakes in this film in regards to shipping. As a marine engineer, they are too long to list. But to mention a glaring few: if a cruise ship is on it's way too NY during New Year's Eve, shouldn't the water be COLD? It is winter. Yet the team frolic about in the water like a swimming pool. Kids cannot hold their breath long enough as adults. If you are willing to suspend belief in a movie that turns the naval architecture and marine engineering world on it's head, then go ahead, watch this movie.Josh Howard and Kurt Russell play their roles well but the cost of Richard Dreyfuss for the small role he plays is hardly worth it. The rest of the ensemble is OK. This one is worth the money if you want to be entertained by a typical action thriller with a different twist, but it's not exactly Petersen's Das Boot. Don't set your expectations too high and you may be pleasantly surprised.",Poseidon
233,americandragonfreak,It made Titanic's special effects look like Barney,8,23 August 2006,"Don't get me wrong, Titanic is one of my favorite films, but the special effects in this film blow Titanic's out of the water. The film stars Josh Lucas as Dylan a gamblar turned hero when the ship capsizes and starts to sink, Kurt Russell as the ex-mayor, ex-fire fighter Robert Ramsey, Emmy Rossum as Robert's in love daughter, Kevin Dillon as Lucky Larry who acts like a jerk before being crushed to death and Mia Maestro as Elena who has stowed away on the ship to see her sick brother (spoiler) sadly, Elena hits her head and drowns in the disaster.The action scenes are intense with some graphic and disturbing deaths along with tons of dead bodies.Overall, I found this film fun to watch, although I find it very wrong that the only character who seems to be religious and actually pray for safety is killed.",Poseidon
234,wtnally,horrible,2,13 May 2006,"MAY CONTAIN Spoilers! this is one of the worst movie's I've ever seen. i guess i realized this about ten minutes in the movie when Josh Lucas, or whatever, jumps into water that is about one hundred feet down, covered in fire, metal poles and sharp object sticking out of the water, and survives saying, ""How am i doing now?"". Wolfgang Petersen always does a great job with his films but this almost ended his career, literally. This film has way too many scenes where everything is just perfect. a huge wave tips over the boat, people inside are safe. they have no way to cross to the otherside of the boat, good ole' josh lucas jumps one hundred feet down with a water hose. the propellers need to be stopped... so they put them in reverse. and the ending is just a little cheesy. there was about 6 or seven other boats out there and you would think one of them would have either been hitten by the wave as well, or seen a boat upside down and decide to do something about it. if you love action movies.... stay away. if you love movies that are just repeating what other movies have already done.... see this. this was a waste of money and i could have seen united 93. 2/10, horrible",Poseidon
235,kasserine,Disaster on The High Screen,5,9 May 2006,"If you're going to produce an expensive action film that involves the ocean, I can't imagine having anyone other then Wolfgang Petersen, of DAS BOOT and The PERFECT STORM fame, as your top choice for director. Also, a nice choice as lead is Kurt Russell. A little older now, but an actor, I've always felt lent a much-needed credibility to the action genre, or at the very least a sense of playfulness.So with those two ""on board"" what the hell happened with POSEIDON? Well, it didn't help that in the opening sequence we catch our first glimpse of the ship. It appears as an enormous CGI effect sailing across the screen. A lame CGI effect. It is hard to get in the right frame of mind for a disaster at sea, when the very ship to be caught up in the disaster doesn't look like a ship. It just doesn't look credible.The characters themselves aren't very believable either. Kurt Russell plays Robert Ramsey, an ex mayor of New York City and it's alluded that he saved some people during a fire. That's it. He's an ex mayor. A lot of development there. Oh, he does have a daughter played by Emmy Rossum, and she does have a boyfriend, played by Mike Vogel, and the Kurt Russell character doesn't really approve of them being together. That's about as much dramatic tension as you're going to get. Although, I should include, Richard Nelson, the character played by Richard Dreyfus. Dreyfus plays a melancholy gay man who has just broken up with his lover and intends to end his life on the voyage. I suppose that should be dramatic too. Mostly, it seemed more comical then anything else. Rounding out the main characters, are a mother and son, a stowaway, and Dylan Johns, played by Josh Lucas, who along with the Ramsey character, become the de facto leaders of the group. As for who Dylan Johns is, and why he is aboard the ship, is beyond me. I don't recall there being any background on him at all. There may have been an aside about him being in the navy or something. Pretty convenient. Clearly he was written in to lead the survivors out. Which is one of the reasons why I have so many problems with these characters. They all seem to be there to serve a function rather then to represent any human dimension. Yes, even in an action film that's sole goal only is to entertain some depth would be nice. Not such a lofty wish, just give the characters some soul. The actors themselves do a decent job. It's just that the script gives them nothing to work with.As an example of this, right after the Poseidon is capsized, the captain announces to the frightened survivors, that he thinks he knows what's happened. Drum roll, please. He announces that a ""rogue wave"" probably hit the ship. Seriously. It sounded really dumb. More then a few people in the audience laughed. Those damn rogue waves. It might have helped if he'd said it within a conversation about what might have happened, but he gets up almost immediately, after the capsizing, and makes his rogue wave announcement. Another funny moment is when ex-mayor Ramsey says ""there is nothing fair about who lives and dies."" Kurt gave it a good shot, but it just sounds really silly.Bad script.What does work is many of the action sequences in the latter half of the film. Here is where director Petersen really shines. His DAS BOOT experience really comes to bear and the film picks up considerably when its focused less on the character interactions and more on their harrowing escapes as they struggle to find their way out of the ship. Once the group gets into the narrow passageways, and faces the threat of the rising water, the pace picks up and the action scenes fly. It seems the more the characters keep their mouths shut, and move, the better the film is.I was seven years old when the POSEIDON ADVENTURE came out and was captivated by it. I still believe it holds its own as an entertaining action adventure film. Gene Hackman, Red Buttons, Shelley Winters, and Roddy McDowall, amongst others, all create some wonderful characters that draw in the audience. The viewer actually cares when disaster strikes and as some of the characters subsequently perish on the journey out of the ship. The script is strong and it gives the actors much to work with.In POSEIDON, it just isn't there. Who are these people? And, why should we care? The film never answers these questions. Mercifully, there are enough well orchestrated action sequences, minus the silly dialogue, that redeem the film somewhat, but not nearly enough.I know I will not be the only one to say this, or probably the first, but rent THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE again, and skip this remake, or at the very least wait till the DVD. You'll miss some of the pleasure of seeing the action on the big screen, but there just isn't enough in POSEIDON to justify a trip to the theater.",Poseidon
236,pax03,edge of your seat disaster picture,7,20 May 2006,"People are going to bash this film because it didn't make a huge opening weekend profit, but just because it didn't do well over the box office doesn't mean its not a good movie, people don't seem to understand that, they think if it makes 100 million over the weekend or something, then its a good movie but thats usually not the case. Poseidon, of course, is a remake of the 70s original 'The Poseidon Adventures.' This one doesn't have the huge all star cast as the first one, Kurt Russell, is probably the biggest name attached to this movie. Richard Dreyfuss and Josh Lucas are the other named stars that are attached. Lucas, is the leader of the group that try and escape out of the ""bottom"" of the ship. Dreyfuss is a breath of fresh air, as I haven't seen him in a movie in a while. Russell, plays the ex mayor of NY with his daughter, Emma Rossum (from the Phantom of the Opera) that go on the cruise with her soon to be husband. The first 30-40 minutes is pretty much character development of all the characters that we will see throughout the film. The ""rogue"" wave comes up pretty quick in the movie, as the New Years rolls in, so does the wave. The crash sequence was intense and graphic as it shows what it would do if a tidal wave would capsize a cruise ship. If you liked the iceberg scene of Titanic, you will like this. Pretty much the rest of the movie was the small group traveling through the ship to try and escape. Every little maze that the group gets into, which is about a half dozen, it gets very intense and edge of your seat. Of course some of the group members die but I wont give away who. The bottom line is, its a good disaster flick with some name stars, of course, its not as good as the first one, but remakes seldom are. Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss are the standouts here, and they are probably the oldest of the whole cast.",Poseidon

The special effects are are not only obvious, but they're too damn busy. Watching is somewhat difficult because there is so much constantly going on that it is hard to decipher which way is up, let alone giving you a moment to put it all together.

All make this movie puzzled and unbearable.Right after the survivors start to climb, you will know one by one they will die in the sequence of less importantcy. Unlike previous version, this re-make doesn't have enough dramatics to go on with. In previous movie, the final survivors met someone during their move and a decision was made.

But except the disaster of the ship wreckage begins earlier in the movie right after celebrating a Happy new year party, really who on earth would celebrate happy new year on a cruise ship it's a pointless idea the film is directed by Wolfgang Peterson the same dude who made das boot wich he somehow was nominated for a best director Oscar well unlike that here he gives a horrendous direction to the movie his directing is bad in this movie it's like as if he wanted to just get paycheck. Or just to a favor of someone perhaps a person who wanted to ruin a reputation of a mainstream classic by remaking one the film also has Emmy rossum who must have been cast in this monstrosity just because he was in the day after tomorrow where she gave a much better performance in. In here she is engaged to some pretty boy who doesn't know how to act either and they have absolutely no chemistry at all you even root for them to not get married, Richard Dreyfus (who once won an Oscar but is perhaps known for being in some of Steven Spielberg's earlier films) here is wasted as some retired old elder who wants to feel young again but fails especially on how he wants to live and you feel that perhaps an elder would waste his money going on a cruise ship just to get in a drama of a disaster wreck, the charachters are again shallow and boring and you don't care for them at all and some scenes in the film prove that first of all there are two lousy charachters who join the surviving group and they die easily and their so hollow and you don't care for them so much that even the other charachters don't care when they die. In one other scene the gang are trying to get through an elevator shaft where Richard Dreyfuss and another hollow side charachter valentine whom he once says he cares for him tries to get through but josh Lucas charachter tells Richard to shake him off and he somehow listens to him and does it because he has no choice but who cares anyway he is too old and I'm sure some elders are so grumpy that they don't care if they die even in a not peaceful way and you even root for that here, valentine is impaled by a long sharp needle from something broken and is crushed by the elevator causing flames and explosions to happen. Speaking of josh lucas's charachter his acting here is terrible arguably the worst performance of all the horrible performances in the movie Later there is a scene when they get out Kurt Russell's charachter dies and you don't care for him either and this is the most unconvincing scene he isn't even mentioned after his death and fails to escape with the others even his daughter and her annoying boyfriend survive but without acting and seeming sad that her father just sacrifices himself this is supposed to be a sad moment but you don't feel for them, and the other passengers die despite saying they will be safe but they were not. And that is the end of this pathetic story. Wow what a piece of crap this is the dialogue is clunky and quality is crappy it's just an absolute messy train wreck of a film.

248,Theothervip,"Standard disaster movie, only more forgettable.",4,27 December 2010,"Rating: **1/2 out of 4.Remaking Irwin Allen's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE doesn't sound much of a bad idea. Considering that the technological advances today, making a disaster movie would make it much more realistic and, therefore, more exciting. That would have been fine for POSEIDON, the remake directed by Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT), except now it seems that the only way to draw audiences to see it is that there should be a.) little character development as possible and b.) tons of CGI-ed action sequences to make it more believably exciting.As a result, POSEIDON is a reasonably well done but utterly simple-minded and empty spectacle. They have the workable premise of the 1972 film and all the technical advancements to make it even more wrenching and involving for the audience, but the script has such boring, uninspired, and unlikable characters on board that it all seems like a poor, basic rehash that tries to modernize everything for this generation by making it as basic as possible; forget subplots, watch out for that wave! In a way, this gives a chance for director Petersen to further establish his skills as an action director. In his previous films, Petersen has made movies that value the use of suspense and tension without the expense of pyrotechnics. In DAS BOOT, the setting is inside a German U-Boat. In AIR FORCE ONE, he reinvigorates the DIE HARD formula by cranking up the suspense alongside some impressive action bits. POSEIDON really owes a lot to Petersen and the way he stages some of the films best moments. The capsizing of The Poseidon is expertly crafted as are some of the film's tighter moments. The feeling of claustrophobia kicks in.But expertly crafted moments like these succumb to some simplistic storytelling and incredibly weak characters. I'm actually rooting for the characters of the classic film (and that one had Shelley Winters play an elderly woman with a swimming medal). This one had no real characters to sympathize for; they're strictly anonymous to us. By the end of the film, we care less about those who survive and those left behind who may be more interesting people than these plucky group of survivors.POSEIDON is not a terrible film and not a bad attempt at an action movie, but if only it had something in it that I cared about.",Poseidon
249,arahman,Limited emotional depth but worth viewing for the action sequences and special effects,5,24 February 2007,"The Poseidon is a remake of the 1970s classic disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure. This starred Gene Hackman, remains hugely popular with day time bank holiday viewers and is largely seen as one of the all time disaster classics. The modern day remake brings state of the art special effects and a huge budget to the table in an attempt to recreate the success of the original with modern day audiences. The special effects in the movie are top notch and the CGI is used effectively in combination with impressive movie sets. The ship is a magnificent creation and encapsulates the grandeur of a modern day Titanic. From start to finish Poseidon is action packed and moves along at a very rapid pace that prevents the viewer from losing interest. The action sequences are well thought out and there are some real nail biting moments where you will hold your breath (in a literal sense). Although the cast puts in a decent performance (you cant really got to wrong with Kurt Russell) the area where Poseidon falls short is with its characters. There is limited depth to any of the characters, only a very superficial back story and no real character development. In addition many of them are easily disliked. Richard Dreyfuss' talents seem to be wasted in his role (which has probably been miscast in my view) but Russell and Lucas hold up the show. Despite a limited script Russell is always able to communicate well with eyes emotional presence. Whilst we may be in a video game era where audiences are seen to be simple French fry eating morons there are numerous movies out there which are able to combine action with emotional depth, this can even be seen on the small screen with action titles like 24. Therefore a blockbuster action flick need no longer just be a mindless adventure. This weakness prevents the Posieden from being a great movie but it remains an action packed film that will keep you engrossed from start to finish and one of the more effective disaster flicks of the modern day era. Don't believe everything you have heard, well worth a viewing (especially in high definition).",Poseidon
250,monimm18,Film capsizes harder than the ship...,4,27 August 2006,"What a shallow copy of the '72 blockbuster... The new ""Poseidon"" has less meaningful dialogue, poorer character development and definition, less believable stunts than the original (although much more outlandish and numerous), and lottsa formulaic plot themes (presented in elementary school level manner): lonely guy finds love, perfect hero father saves his offspring and the day, disillusioned man ready to give up on life finds new meaning to live, grotesquely bad guy is punished for his lack of character - usually by dying right after he said/did something despicable, so his death would feel gratifying and wouldn't spoil the entertainment. The human aspect of the story is so sketchy and superficially presented that I found it impossible to give a damn about the characters and root for them; that would have made the film a bit more compelling and exciting to watch. We might as well watch a bunch of mice finding their way through a maze (although I think even that might have been more compelling). The only decent (not great) things in this film are the special effects and the attention to technical detail. Also, what's up with the music? I could swear it was a version of the score of ""The Day after Tomorrow"" - another brilliantly formulaic Hollywood burp. At least that one had a message and some spectacular special effects...",Poseidon

Especially it's done in 1972 and back then they really had to use their minds to figure out how to do some stuff.Now this one, shame on Wolfgang for coming out with such garbage. The plot is so predictable, the character die in ways that are so obvious and dumb. Overall, this movie is a complete no-brainer. But sometimes those type of films can be stupid but fun, but this movie is stupid and dumb.The only cool thing about this movie, is the actual rogue wave itself. It looked good and the way the boat flipped was good too. But then when the guy in charge (can't remember if it's the captain) says they should stay down there because they are ""safe"", you just know they are not. Then Kurt and co. go play Tarzan around the boat. Yes, there are worse movies than this but this one is really not worth it.",Poseidon

The first time they got themselves in a spot of bother, watching others' rescue them was mildly entertaining. By the fifth time - with all the attendant screaming and wailing - I wished I was physically there to hold both their heads under water for a few minutes. Besides, I knew they would survive; no way would the producers have allowed the kid to die.If they had? Now THAT would have made for a refreshing movie!",Poseidon
254,fx_gent,"Decent remake, more intense",8,21 May 2006,"I had the pleasure of seeing the original Poseidon Adventure in 1973 at the age of nine at my local theater shortly after its release. I fell in love with the film, and it remains my favorite motion picture of all time. I confess to a certain measure of anger that wells up at comments that razz the film, including that it is cheesy. So, when I heard that it had been remade, I was curious to see which route the movie would take. Whether that of the book it was based on, or the first film. This weekend, I finally had the chance to catch the film, and found that is took a route close to the first script. Although I must confess that in the back of my mind I kept trying to compare it to the first film (who doesn't with a remake), I did find the film to be good. Updated special effects have helped to convey a greater sense of the horror that would occur in such a tragedy, something the first one could not really do. The life and death struggle for survival was more intense as well, adding to the drama. My big beef though, is that Andre Braugher, who is a great actor, was wasted in a minor role. Does the movie follow the the standard rules of a disaster film, yes. Does it detract from the film, no. My suggestion, see both films and judge for yourself.",Poseidon
255,conmech,"Good idea, exciting, but very shallow...",7,9 November 2007,"I had rented this movie because I like the idea, a ship turning upside down and people trying to crawl out of it. Even though it's a remake, it wasn't a problem for me, since I don't know the original movie anyway. The shooting and special effects are as good as we could least expect from Wolfgang Petersen. Actually I have the feeling he used the same giant pool he had made for his ""Perfect Storm"", but that's just me being cheap.Now, for the bad part. I don't know what's wrong with Hollywood movies getting shallower and shallower. It just made me angry where the movie didn't feel the need at all to tell us how or why that ""rogue wave"" came. I mean, is that such a usual thing that we don't even need to worry about its origin? The upside down ship is the main idea of the whole movie and we don't know why it happened? Secondly, the ending was as shallow as the beginning. People got saved, started laughing altogether and it was all fine.And something which I just couldn't understand. Maybe it's me who doesn't know physics well enough, but when the windows shattered and the room filled with water and the ship still hadn't sunk, couldn't ANYONE have just swam out of the windows? Even just one person? As a conclusion; if u borrow this movie from someone, or if your friend invites you over and has this movie, it's fun to watch it. But if u're gonna rent a DVD yourself, there are a lot better movies out there which will beat this one in every category.",Poseidon

""Rogue waves"" are ""rare and deadly"", not to mention impossible and thoroughly unbelievable in deep water and clear weather. No wonder I have never heard of a cruise liner or any other large vessel capsizing in the open ocean.This was a completely formulaic disaster movie indistinguishable from low-budget Irwin Allen wannabe crap except for the quality of the production values.Even the digital animation looked fake in some places -- why not pan around a real Carnival liner with a helicopter?

257,SlackerRus2000,A Good Popcorn movie,7,17 May 2006,"I for one am tired of overblown character development in Hollywood epics. Since titanic every epic under the sun has spent too much time focusing on character development. Yes, lenghty character development can heighten emotional connection to a character as seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogies, but those movies were 3 hour long minimum. Is it too much to ask for an intelligently written movie where character development is developed during action sequences and through intelligent and simple dialogue. This is where Poseidon succeeds above other disaster flicks. Yes, a slow burn works, but in a disaster flick you just want to get to the ensuing chaos. Luckily 10 minutes in all hell breaks loose and your there to enjoy the ride.The character's all have varied and believable reasons for becoming the rag tag group that the story focuses on. But the story isn't about the character as much as the terrors they face, the nail-biting action sequence come like blow from a prize fighter, one after another with barely any time to come up for air. The effects are amazing and the acting is conveyed well by the cast, although some cheese definitely comes into the mix( hey, it's Hollywood, what do you expect?) Some critics have cited the time length of the movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes, as being a fault, but I enjoy the upbeat tempo and pace of the movie. I don't know about you, but I come to the movie for escapism, for thrills and chills, and this movie delivers. Definitely the formula starts to wear thin near the end of the movie, so it is a testament to the director for knowing his audience and that the movie remains interesting for only so long. A great popcorn flick with some of the most nail-biting sequences and an upbeat tempo that doesn't quit from 10 minutes into the movie to the climactic finally. Don't miss this wave.",Poseidon
258,hughie522,Reimagined 'Poseidon' makes waves...,8,6 June 2006,"I've read the book, seen the 1972 original, seen the sequel and seen the NBC miniseries. And now I've seen 'Poseidon', and frankly, I'm impressed. There's very little characterisation, a minimum of dialogue, the characters are wooden and not well explored. The script is uncomplicated and not terribly wordy. Am I disappointed, though? The opening shot told me everything I needed to know about 'Poseidon'. As we perform a 360 degree fly around of a non-existent, modern luxury liner, you realise that the ship is the star. The ship is to 'Poseidon' as KITT is to 'Knight Rider'. We have an assortment of (somewhat clichéd) characters - you have your non-nonsense leader/compulsive gambler, the disgraced father, the single mother and her son, the ageing bachelor who's been unlucky in love, the attractive, younger woman and the young couple deeply in love despite the father's resentment. And then, quite suddenly, everything is turned upside down (literally!).'Poseidon' never pauses, never relents and refuses to let you catch your breath. Just when you think, 'Things can't get any worse', they do! Everything from flash fires, to flooding, to falling debris - Wolfgang Petersen shows the avid disaster movie lover EXACTLY what he and she wants to see - scenes of grandiose destruction and human suffering! I may be wrong. Actually, a lot of moviegoers want to see Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet make out in a Renault (if you were expecting something 'sedate' like the first hour of 'Titanic', then think again - you're barely given 15 seconds of 'sedate' before SOMETHING terrible happens).If you want romance, and character development, and human triumph over adversity may I recommend 'Titanic' and 'The Poseidon Adventure'. If you want something a little more like...say, 1998's 'Deep Rising' (""Now what?!"") or 'Speed 2: Cruise Control' (as in a no-brainer, special effects laden, thrill-a-minute action extravaganza (copyright (c) on that statement)) then 'Poseidon' is the film for you!",Poseidon
259,Ata-2,Below average disaster movie,5,15 May 2006,"This version is reasonably different from the original but all in all it is not even as good as the many made-for-TV disaster movies. You never get to care whether any of the characters live or die. I also found the camera work incredibly annoying. There are hardly any scenes where the camera is more than 5 feet away from any character's face, so you never get any sense of scale. They could have filmed it all in a set the size of my apartment. I guess the intention was to make you feel claustrophobic or something ""clever"" like that.The original version of this movie and other great disaster movies like Titanic, and Towering Inferno gave you a sense that you could see what was going on so you got involved by trying to figure out how to overcome the challenges the characters faced with them. More importantly in the first part of these movies you got to know the characters and care what happens to them.

In this version, they seem to be trying to keep the tension going all the time, with threat following threat, and the end result is that there are *no* tension-filled moments at all. There is a scene involving an emergency shut-off button that actually had people laughing out loud in what should have been the most gripping moment of the film.A scene were Kurt Russell administers CPR is hilarious! Just watch his wrist collapse each time he tries a compression. Not to mention grunting like Jimmy Conner serving. :-) As we follow the small band through the ship, we have no real interest after a while as to whether they escape or die. All we're interested in the amusing way they do it.Go see this film. It will make you laugh, and there is no thinking required. Except when a scene has an entryway with suction powerful enough to hold a gas tank solid in place, but doesn't snap a character's spine when he gets caught.Yet another Hollywood remake that just fails totally in what it sets out to do.

I never been on a cruise ship before and know no idea about boats so I feel like i am pretty clueless and that's probably why I think the movie is decent. The only thing that makes me mad is Elena's death and the fact it was never brought up that Valentin was the reason she was there.

Very touching movie except for a few lines near the end sounds ridiculous when Kurt said to his daughter in a very hard situation which I don't remember exactly ""you know that I love you"". Who would say such things in a bad situation that decide your fate, your destiny between life and death ? It sounds unreal, it sounds stupid to me. Anyway, this movie is going to be in my best movies' list. For it's great acting, cinematographic, touching scenes, and the will to survive.

The actual wave sequence was decent, but a little underdone, (except for those is the flash fire sequences, they were well done). I kept expecting it to get better, but it never did; in fact it got worse. Can I ask just how Kurt Russell knew exactly where the controls for the engines were? About 150 yards down this corridor, under water! Seems like most ship movies I've seen there are a full set of controls in the engine room. Why would the motors be running anyway? How could the tanks fill so rapidly if they were upside down? And do workers normally go into these huge tanks to turn the pumps on? Yes the deeper they got, they deeper my heart sank. How come the boyfriend show absolutely no signs of injury 10 minutes after being freed from the lighting rig? Dreyfuss should have been dead after getting hit by that door.

We have Emmy Rossum who is beautiful and a very great character in the movie. Josh Lucas is superb as the man who wants to escape. Kurt Russel did a good job played the protective father.

The opening shot is remarkable but it's all pretty much downhill from there. This version of the story of a small (and painfully artificially diverse) band trying to survive the capsize of an ocean liner makes for yet another sad comparison of seventies versus contemporary film-making. Today (once again) technological virtuosity has to stand in for the most basic story-telling not to mention an almost complete disregard for the basic rules of nature. The actors look abandoned and lost in the face of the effects. Dreyfus seems vaguely embarrassed and Josh Lucas offers a characterization that belongs more in a James Bond film. The original was full of clichés and cardboard characters too but the largely old-school cast (Stella Stevens, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters et al) knew how to carry it off. The new ensemble hasn't a clue. Director Wolfgang Petersen's career has been wildly erratic. Perhaps it was hoped that sending him back to sea would return him to the glories of ""Das Boot"".

Thanks you for spitting out another INSTANTLY forgettable ""Blockbuster"" Thank God I only paid $4 dollars to see this. Not only can't the Studios come up with original material. The material they remake is worse than the original. If this crap keeps up you will have even less of an audience. A good cast given nothing to chew on and a Director who has made great films and this is what we get? 150 million and the Ballroom set in the original was more impressive?Video games are so prevalent in society that I fear their mind numbing influence is starting to permeate even NON video game derived movies. The original movie was a good solid, involving movie. This remake takes every element of the original and removes what made it involving. I mean EVERY element. There are people out there making these decisions!! And they are paid huge sums to make these decisions! With the talent in front of and behind the camera this is truly frightening as this seems to be the norm at the present.Right from the start there is almost NO set up. We don't know where the ship is, where it is sailing, even what ocean it's on! Things that actually would create some atmosphere like the originals speech by the Captain explaining the origin of Poseidon. Greek God of the Sea. They are sailing on the Mediterranean, to Greece? Get it? Cheesy but involving. You know it gives the proceedings some gravatis, some mystery. In the remake we get nothing, we are are in Video game land, we don't have time for such things.Even the cause for the disaster has absolutely no set up. Happy new year, bang, the tidal wave hits. Unlike the originals slow build up, as it explained WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHY! Even the effects in the original worked better. They were simpler but executed as a whole created more of an impact because of the tension that was built up. Again a sense of gravity, HUMAN INVOLVEMENT and Atmosphere! Even in the original, Leslie Nielsen's corny grimace as the wave engulfs the ship. It's goofy but you REMEMBER IT. You know a character we identify with reacting to the impending disaster. It's a very basic cinematic technique. But I guess todays more ""sophisticated"" audience don't need this kind of thing anymore.There is no human involvement in the wave hitting in this remake. The Captain isn't called to the bridge, no build up, just some crew members we've had no contact with running around. Absolutely unmemorable. The effects are impressive but who cares, I'm not given anything to latch on to.Straight across the board EVERY situation is diminished from the original. The scene chewing conflict between Gene Hackaman and Ernest Borgnine is totally lost in the remake. There is NO conflict with the characters. NONE! It's just one disaster to overcome to the next. You know , like a VIDEO GAME.Even the self sacrificing Shelly Winters death swim has almost no emotional impact because the character doesn't return and die in front of everybody. Like DUH! Hey screen writers perhaps you should learn of something called ELEMENTS OF DRAMA!! Even if you have no talent you could at least COPY the original, not make it worse! Absolutely mind boggling!!

Sure it's a remake but at least they made this one different enough from the original and in many ways I found it better. It is faster paced than the original with enough pause to create human interest and character development. The special effects were 30 years more impressive than the original and lastly the director was brave enough to kill off characters you don't think are going to die!! How often in horror films or Jurrassic park movies do you see the survival group and know instinctively whose living and whose dying- well this one kept me off balance all film long. The drama was fast and the terror realistic. You could listen for the audience holding their breaths seeing if they can make it to the next level. I suppose if there was any one flaw it was a lack of total character history- the main characters pasts are eluded to with enough information to make a supposition but not a line by line summary explaining precisely why they act the way they act. On the other hand that removal of pin pointed character history makes for a wonderful table top dialogue during a post movie dinner. I don't care what the others clamor-I went in thinking I would see a typical film that was pretty good and instead I really liked this movie and have every intention of buying the DVD.,Poseidon

Poseidon focuses on what the characters focus on, survival. The perfect display of this is the scene where an otherwise wholesome character kicks another good character down an elevator shaft to avoid both of them dying. Isn't that what you would do? Yes it is. This movie is brave enough to not save everybody, to not have very many heroes, and to have it's characters act as a real person might act. There was no worse seen in movie history that during volcano, when a man jumps into a flaming pit of lava to save an unconscious person who he doesn't even know. What was the point? A real person says, well I'm safe, and he's unconscious so he won't feel it anyway, therefore I'm leaving. That's what a real person would do, and that's what this movie does. It gives real terror, and real reactions without a bunch of contrived sappy moments. I say good work.",Poseidon

275,Aronnax,"mean spirited Poseidon loses the ""adventure.""",4,13 May 2006,"An epic letdown from Wolfgang Peterson. The original film was always good entertainment, but comparing the two versions makes the original look like Citizen Kane! It's like Wolfgang took everything that was good about the original and threw it away. Ronald Neame? Never realized what a great director he was (DeMille Jr!) until I saw this remake. Just compare the way he staged the big scenes, framed the action with a sense of scope, gave his actors real characters to play and used sets, lighting, music and pacing to really pull you into the ""adventure."" The original is always knocked for its ""cardboard"" characters and lame dialogue. But at least it had a ""theme."" It was about something. It was ""if you want to survive then start climbing. don't sit around and wait for help to arrive. Religion won't save you, the government won't save you (don't forget this was Watergate era.) Only you and your own hard work will save you."" It seemed like everything was shot too close. there was no scope or sense of epic-ness. was this to save money so they didn't have to build big sets? It felt like this film was edited with a hack saw that took away all suspense. All of a sudden a wave comes and it turns over. This modern ship didn't have any kind of warning system that would warn of a ""wall of water 90 feet high""?? Did I blink and miss the scene where the wave shows up on the radar? Thank goodness there was an officer on the bridge who could ""sense"" the oncoming tidal wave. Gimme a break.where was the Christmas tree? In the original you could feel that it was Christmas/New Years. Decorations, baby! In this remake they simply decide to follow Josh Lucas up some wreckage. No drama at all! what about all of Richard Dreyfuss' gay buddies? He did't even try to find them! The fx were very cheesy digital. I saw it in IMAX so maybe that's why. Was it my imagination, or did the first trailer have more of the ship turning over?Terrible action music! Didn't they learn anything from John Williams' moody original? But the thing that killed this for me was how mean spirited and gory it was. My 12 year old daughter kept turning away. I saw the original when I was 10 and one burned chef in the kitchen was really heartbreaking. But now people are bar b cued in flash fires or electrocuted in nightclubs with no feeling. when Lucas tells Dreyfus to deliberately drop the waiter in order to save himself, then Drefus kicks the poor guy to his death -- you could really feel the audience detach. Too cruel to be called ""entertainment."" Save your money. Or better yet, rent Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and watch it on fast forward and you'll get a sense of this loser.",Poseidon

I had high hopes for the film, and they weren't met. Poseidon is an especially unnecessary remake. As happens so often with remakes, the re-makers squander the original's appeal, as if they have no idea why 1972's The Poseidon Adventure was a hit. Video games must have influenced the film, too. As an intrepid group of characters make their way through the bowels of an overturned ocean liner, they're tested by one chamber of death after another.Knowing so little about Poseidon's characters, it's difficult to care about their fates. On the contrary, characters in The Poseidon Adventure are practically members of the family. The acting wasn't anything special, and most of them where B-list celebrities who where trying to get noticed by the public, to re-establish their careers.Overall, this film wasn't anything above average.

When I think of some of the great ideas I've had in my time for which I couldn't get funding, my heart sinks. Especially when Hollyweird shells out $140 million to help sink this incredibly droll and hackneyed rework of a classic. Why 'remake' a movie if the objective is merely to make a pig's ear of a favorite classic? Movie makers have the money and wherewithal to make anything they want these days, so how does a movie like this get made, or approved for funding? What were Russell and Dreyfuss thinking? Are they this desperate for parts? Both superb actors in their own rights, they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel by appearing in this cheesy attempt at reviving a disaster movie. It goes to show that money doesn't make a movie. Jackson's 'KING KONG' is a point in question - $200+ million for a B monkey flick that makes a mockery of one of the world's classics. With all the CGI used these days we are fast approaching a time where 'actors' will simply make a few faces on film in the privacy of their Hollyweird mansions, which the director can then later ""Cut & Paste"" into his copy of Photoshop. Zero time was spent on developing the characters for POSEIDON. Russell was Mayor of New York 'for a while' it seems, while Dreyfuss was apparently having problems with his Gay lover? Were Dreyfuss removed entirely from this flick, would anyone have noticed? The entire flick rides on Russell's shoulders and we see him laboring as he drags along the rest of the crew for 90+ minutes. The Plot? We find ourselves on the ultimate cruise liner (presumably fitted with the latest in navigational technology, none capable of detecting a huge wave as it approaches the ship), with a tidal wave approaching, apparently out of nowhere and from an unknown source? Wave strikes ship. Ship inverts. What caused the tidal wave? Whale fart? Eathquake? We are left wondering how a 200 foot wave suddenly overturns a 60,000 ton luxury cruiser. The ship's captain yells the usual ""Hard a Port"" command, presumably to surf his ship to safety on a beach 200 miles away. The captain, clearly the movie's 'ethnic minority' component makes a speech about . . well, we don't really know or care, as Dreyfuss gently weeps into his gin, Russell frets over his daughter's hormones and a short order cook magically stows away a girl with ambitions of Coming to America, from  somewhere. The scene of Dreyfuss balancing on the ship's railings, apparently about to end his life (and hopefully his part in this movie) is laughable as he spots the enormous tidal wave approaching the ship. As if this wave would be visible in the dead of night on a pitch-black ocean. Why did the ship's sophisticated equipment not detect this 'rogue' wave or Dreyfuss' bad acting? The characters are weak to the point of non-existent, the CGI is poor by today's standards and the film trundles along with one after the other of pretty lame effects and unbelievable story line, such as it was. The whole fan suction scene had me weeping as our intrepid hero (Russell?) reverses the fan to create suction so that debris can be thrown in to jam the blades. Okay. Fine. Er, why? In an inverted ocean-liner, no-one is going to make head nor tail of the layout of the ship, let alone have detailed engineering maps conveniently floating by wherever the stricken survivors happen to be. 'POSEIDON' is OK for a rainy Sunday afternoon as long as you don't expect too much or anything at all. For the budget they had, this movie should have been a blockbuster, not a gut buster. What was the point of the jerk in the movie? Who were the characters? Where did the wave come from? So many questions, zero answers. Movies should entertain us, not leaving us agog in disbelief. Sure, rent the DVD but don't expect anything special, not even in the CGI department. Instantly forgettable as an expensive washout.

282,doughelo,It was the errors that really bothered me,3,15 May 2006,"The worst error concerned the bow thruster at the end. Why was it still running? Almost all other electrical power was out, and a bow thruster would not be on an emergency circuit. When Richard Dreyfuss opens the hatch into the bow thruster shaft, a hurricane force of wind blows into the room. Ship propellers are slow-turning compared to aircraft propellers (so as to avoid cavitation) and are not going to move large quantities of air - hardly any, in fact, as they're not shaped to move low density air. There seemed to be a propeller on either side of the shaft. For air to blow inward, both props would have to be pulling air towards each other. The idea in a bow thruster is to pull water in one end and out the other. Nobody would build an inward-opening hatch below the waterline.Also, it seemed that from the ballast tank (by definition and appearance at the bottom of the ship) they seemed to travel UP a few levels, thus in reality placing them above the bottom of the ship.I found it a bit hard to believe the Captain could have convinced anyone to stay in an underwater room with giant windows showing the ocean behind the glass.",Poseidon
283,fredk_us,Awesome Reworking of Our Beloved Original,8,13 May 2006,"Ahoy, shipmates, and I'm really glad that you are all not amongst the many who perished aboard the Southampton built POSEIDON.We've just come back from a matinée and we all of us found the movie to be awesome. Some of the critics and other reviewers got things wrong here and there (which is annoying to a professional film critic), but I know sometimes you gotta see a movie more than once.I totally respect the opinions of folks here who found it falling far short of our beloved original or just plain bad, but I really enjoyed this ride. A few things for now - and I think I can avoid any spoilers today:1. The film was better than Petersen's ""The Perfect Storm."" In that film (probably out of some respect to its real-life casualties), we never really see what happens to the guys aboard altogether.2. There is a character on board POSEIDON who is a lot like the 72 film's Linda Rogo, but with a twist!3. Despite the fact the rogue wave comes so early in the film, we most certainly do learn so much about the characters who climb up through the ship and we certainly do care about them, especially when they are in peril and when some folks do not make it.4. This is a non-stop ""ride"" if you will, and you will not be bored.5. The film, in part due to its musical soundtrack, pulls a lot of emotion out of you, and I was often close to tears from the very beginning: knowing the great ship is doomed, seeing so many passengers and crew excited about New Year's, and the fact that music plays whilst the ship is capsizing.6. There are plenty of rearranged bits from the original incorporated in POSEIDON, including dialog and the looks on people's faces during the course of the climb. And touches from Paul Gallico's book missing in the original return here.7. One of the most impacting moments of the film is the silent exchange between two certain characters when one of them reopens an elevator shaft.8. This film's characters have a lot of guilt written on their faces and there are moments, too, where what is not said is even more effective. For that, I say, the acting is generally very good.9. Death visits every part of the ship and it isn't pretty. It's realistic and reminds us that when entertainment is so close to reality we are -- as was often the case with Hitchcock's films -- morally implicated by watching the spectacle.10. There is a character in the film who is rather like Nonnie.11. The line from the book about the ship seeming to be retching her bowels in mortal agony is not a one-time deal. It is repeated again and again and you do ""care"" for the ship as well as its characters.12. When Gloria performs her songs (which are tailored to the tale just as ""The Morning After"" was), you want to get up and dance with the rest of the passengers. Party!That's it for right now and I await more views on the film by my shipmates, but I will add one SPOILER, but you can avoid it by not scrolling down too far. Whew!

This was a fun casual film to watch.... Nothing bad or amazing about it, it's simply a movie worth watching. The time that went into creating sets for this must have been a LONG time, as considering most of the film the ship is upside down, the attention to detail of the background and the physics to it all had to be 100%.

288,chopendoz,The Hollywood imagination,3,3 June 2006,"This movie epitomizes what is wrong with Hollywood today. Because they lack imagination, the major film studios either copy an idea from a foreign film (Japanese, French, English, especially) or make a sequel or remake of an an existing moneymaker and milk it to death. Where are the original ideas? The Hollywood movie industry (and most of American TV for that matter) has become far too idealistic in my view. The characters are depicted as, not how people really are, but how we would like them to be, and the viewers often emulate what they see on screen as if life actually IS like that. Why should it be all about the 'bottom line'. Out of the top 10 top grossing movies each year, how many actually make a profit? It seems to be a matter of just churning out this sort of garbage and hoping for the best. Why don't the major studios spend the same amount of money making fewer but better films? One wonders sometimes how people are convinced into investing good money in making this rubbish. Poseidon? So far this 'blockbuster' has grossed $50 million  a long way from the $140 million it cost to make. Chances are it won't even break even. It becomes very obvious right from the start that it is formulaic and clichéd. For example, why anyone in their right mind would take a woman and her young son along with the exploring party is anyone's guess. Probably because they prove useful along the way. The Hispanic busboy (Valentine) who tags along was the obvious candidate to die being a nonentity, an unknown actor. It's all squarely aimed at the 'demographic'  the 13-30 group. That's why there is always a child involved in the story, why most of the characters are 30 years old  and good looking. That's why we have a politically correct cast with a black captain, Hispanic entertainers, etc. There is a always a love interest to attract the female segment of the audience and there is always a happy ending one way or another. We have the usual combination of 'B' list actors and those desperate for work, who go through the motions of what passes for acting these days. 'Stand on your mark and say your line when it's your turn'. Don't the directors realize that when people talk to one another, they often interrupt one another? Robert Altman knows this but few others. The special effects are good but with a few too many quick camera movements that are hard on the eye after a while. After only a few minutes I realized that I had seen this movie before in all its forms. Even though the backdrop changes, the character development is always the same. The guy who cares only for himself discovers that he has some redeeming features, The hero will do heroic things and maybe make the supreme sacrifice to save others. Father and son/daughter will reconcile their differences, the coward becomes brave, etc.etc. I've seen it all before.",Poseidon
289,jimhills,"If you have seen the original, don't waste your time.",5,7 June 2006,"www.kajatm.com It has been said that the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. However when it comes to remakes in Hollywood imitation often result in movies that are far worst than the original. The remakes that have actually turned out to be good, while limited, have had some success in recent years. Such movies as the Thomas Crown Affair, Ocean's 11, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Grudge and The Italian Job we very well done and have become some of my favorites. Poseidon, my friends, is not one of these movies.Just like the original, Poseidon is the story about a new cruise ship that has been struck by a rogue wave which results in the ship flipping over and trapping the guest within the sinking ship. The main characters of the original have been replaced by Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss* and Jimmy Bennett. Again just like the original, a group of passengers realize that if they stay where the captain wants them to stay they are in certain doom and will end up drowning. And this is where Poseidon lost me. Where is the compelling speech from Josh Lucas, just like Gene Hackman before him, to try and convince the passengers to follow him out of the ship? The whole scene is lost without this speech. Why is it that from that point forward it seems like the whole new version of Poseidon is on fast forward? There is no plot development, no character development and basically it just seems like Wolfgang Peterson had something better to do while making this movie. I understand that the ship is sinking and they have to get off as soon as possible but I distinctly remember the original having the same story line and I didn't feel like the characters were running some obstacle course that they needed to get through in 2 minutes. I think that if he would have taken the time to watch the original he would have come to the realization that he could have put 30 more minutes in the movie and it probably would have turned out better.The only positive thing that I saw about this movie was the scenes that showed the ship getting hit by the rogue wave. I would like to take the time to thank whoever created CGI. People flying everywhere, people dying, water taking over the boat and just the realistic destruction that they can create using a computer is really amazing. This is the only category that tops the original. But outside of that this movie left me very unsatisfied.Some classic movies such as The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, Empire Strikes Back, The Magnificent Seven, The Wizard of OZ, Caddy Shack, Airplane, Jaws, Raging Bull, Cool Hand Luke, The Sting and Rear Window should automatically go on the ""These Movies Reached Perfection the First Time so we are Never Ever Remaking Them!"" list. Poseidon Adventure should have been one of these movies. I hate the fact that nothing is sacred in Hollywood.Give me Gene Hackman, give me Ernest Borgnine, give me Red Buttons, give me Roddy McDowell and give me the original Poseidon Adventure. Don't give me Josh Lucas, don't give me Kurt Russell, don't give me Kevin Dillion and don't give me the new Poseidon. If you have never seen the original Poseidon Adventure I fully expect you to enjoy this movie but unfortunately I have and that ruined my movie experience.

292,kctotal,Not Entirely Lost at Sea,9,31 March 2007,"Probably one of the biggest box-office bombs of the year, it was easily underestimated by various international critics, and I myself must admit that I wasn't that eager to see it. Arguably, it didn't seem very original, but rather a mix of ""Titanic"" and ""The Perfect Storm"". I now guess that this was why I liked it so much  my expectations were incredibly low, so it easily exceeded them.As I have previously mentioned, the plot is quite ordinary. Grand luxury cruise liner gets hit by colossal wave and passengers seek way of escape. Sounds pretty ordinary, but the film is crammed with breathtaking and claustrophobic sequences. Throw in half a dozen of boring characters and you have a classical disaster movie. Kurt Russell heads a vast cast made of B-movie actors; even ""Black Eyed Peas"" singer ""Fergie"" has an appearance in this flick. Thankfully, she has a splendid voice which prevented her short appearance to be forgotten. Also trying to escape are Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfus and Mia Maestro, but again the characters are underdeveloped and uninteresting, so I basically couldn't really care less if they died or not. Okay, then perhaps I was mildly interested, but no more. However, Mia Maestro managed to capture the character's fear, as all others should have. Emmy Rossum's character also shows some emotion towards the end, but it is too late to be taken seriously. If the occasion had happened a little earlier, then we may have seen some character development, but it isn't, so we won't. A veteran like Kurt Russell would have been expected to add some emotional depth, yet he joins the rest. What a waste! And just why didn't the cast give its best to help stop a predictable flop from being one? At least it would have the critical acclaim to match up for very poor ticket sales. This is a problem commonly encountered within movies with a big cast, as in X-Men and many other blockbusters.So then what was it that made Poseidon more than just a normal blockbuster movie? The most prominent thing in the movie is the Water itself. It takes the role of an unstoppable menacing villain, which helps take the movie to different heights. The director, Wolfgang Peterson (Troy) returns to his rank as master of the sea. Yes, he is a wonder at creating tension with water. This had already been displayed in his previous two films, ""Das Boot (The Boat)"" and ""The Perfect Storm"". The elevator shaft sequence is a memorable one and it sets the beat for the rest of the film. The scenes are claustrophobic and you'll be on the edge of you seat. Even though ""Poseidon"" doesn't reach the climax generated by ""Titanic"", you have to admit that they can still be very gripping.What didn't work was the absurdity of certain situations. I wanted to see people being injured and losing their minds throughout the trip, but they just walk on with minor injuries. Didn't the filmmakers understand that people wanted to see something REAL for a change? We don't want to see the usual nice, clean-cut characters; we want to see conflict or something that really would have happened in such a situation. The only scene in which the film considers my previous point is when Richard Dreyfus' character shakes off the waiter in the elevator shaft. The character's relationships are also ignored so what the film turns out to be is a series of obstacle a couple of lifeless characters have to pass.Verdict""Poseidon"" isn't a bad movie, even though there is much to be arranged. It is no ""Titanic"", but it is definitely worth watching.",Poseidon
293,Ndirsch11,A Monumental Mess of a Movie!,4,16 May 2006,"Wolfgang Petersen's 'Poseidon' is a movie so lacking in innovation, creativity, and excitement that one becomes almost angry to learn that Hollywood spent upwards of $160 million dollars on it. With that much money, one would expect at least some great special effects and some engaging action scenes. I went into 'Poseidon' with low expectations and the understanding that if I wanted character development and plot, I wasn't going to find it. But this new 'Poseidon', a remake of the much much better 'Poseidon Adventure' from 1972, can't even deliver in the technical department of movie-making. There is not one convincing shot or special effect throughout the entire film. As I sat watching 'Poseidon', I was too aware of CGI trickery and special effects to be convinced that I was watching anything other than a big Hollywood set. Even an ambitious tracking shot of the ship at the beginning of the movie seems phony, as we become quickly aware that the sunset in the background is nothing but a ""green screen."" Even the photography and lighting disappoints, as every shot seems murky at best. If you're going to build such large and beautiful sets for a movie, then at least give us some good shots of it so the audience can appreciate it!I say all this with the knowledge that the film's director, Wolfgang Petersen, has always been an admirably ambitious director and a technical wizard much in the same vein as Peter Jackson and James Cameron. This is the same man who gave us the wonderfully imaginative 'The NeverEnding Story', the tense thriller 'In the Line of Fire', and was nominated for an academy award for 'Das Boot'. To know how good a director Mr. Petersen can be, makes watching 'Poseidon' all the more depressing. The biggest problem of all, perhaps, with this movie is that it's just simply in too much of a hurry to get the action going. The movie barely develops any time at all before the tidal wave hits to developing the protagonists whom the audience is expected to root for throughout the rest of the movie. We're introduced to Kurt Russel's character, who's identified as a former mayor of New York City. But what about it, though? Does being a former mayor adequately explain where this man gets all his courage and resolve? We're also introduced to Richard Dreyfuss's character, a lonely older man much like the Red Buttons role in the original film. (Spoiler Alert!) In a ridiculous scene, the script has Richard Dreyfuss considering suicide by climbing over the railing at the edge of the ship. Suddenly, he sees the rogue tidal wave approaching and, guess what?, he decides he wants to live! It's absurd to see such a great actor as Richard Dreyfuss fumbling around in an inept disaster flick and reciting corny dialogue. He's above this kind of material. None of these characters make sense not only because none of them are developed, but also because the screenplay treats them as raw material. The script sees them as rag dolls thrown around the ship to be chewed up and spit out in an endless fight for survival. But how can we root for the survival of characters that aren't even convincing, let alone engaging, in the first place?One of the reasons why the original 'Poseidon Adventure' worked so well was that it had characters who were tangible and real coupled with great actors who took advantage of the memorable, yet goofy dialogue. This new 'Poseidon' is thoroughly forgettable and bland. It tries to dabble in staunch, gritty realism when in fact it probably should have hammed it up and gone way over the top. What a mess! 4 out of 10 stars.",Poseidon
294,rpannier,150 million disaster,2,18 March 2007,"This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen. It's also an extremely bad movie. The script is really weak. The lines were pathetic. The characters just damned awful. I was really hoping that everyone in the group died -- that included that little kid. There just is nothing really likable about this movie. The special effects are good, but I can play video games if I want to see special effects. Aside from really awful and dislikeable characters, there are four other things that ruin this movie (IMO): 1. The original was a great movie. If you're going to remake a great movie, at least make something good. 2. The set up was of the movie was bad. It happened too quickly. I guess they were desperate to show the tidal wave as quickly as possible. 3. The ending was just lame. 4. When you have good actors in a movie, please have a good script for them.",Poseidon
295,f_mckissack,Wolfgang Petersen gives another reason to fear the sea,8,3 February 2010,"I feel the need to defend this film, in part because of its rather low rating on this site, and also for its lacklustre reception in general. Perhaps, being a remake, audiences are overly critical, maybe it is a case of seeing one disaster film too many, either way this is a flick worth watching.If there is one thing Wolfgang Petersen is capable of directing it is a film set on the vast ocean. From 'Das Boot' to 'The Perfect Storm' Wolfgang elicits a sense both of respect and outright fear for the destructive power of the sea. The visual effects are brutal and convincing, the pacing is spot on, the preaching is kept to a minimum, eyes on you Gene Hackman, and overall it is a fun underwater romp. Plenty of heart in throat moments for characters who, while disposable, are still somewhat engaging. Josh Lucas is fantastic, Kurt Russell is cheesy and the love interest is blase, but it hardly detracts from the action. Oh, and Fergie is in it, what more do you need!?",Poseidon
296,nalders,"After I write this review, I'm going to try to forget all about this movie.",1,5 September 2006,"Because it's so bad, it's not even worth hating. I'm not going to waste more time on this than necessary. The acting ranged from marginal to bad. The special effects are typical CGI, which no longer is terribly impressive, save as a barometer for how much money has been dumped into a film. Plot development is non-existent; merely a series of physical barriers for the characters to surpass. There is no character development. The technical errors are legion. Most damningly, a ""rogue wave"" capsizes this huge luxury liner in the middle of the ocean. This is impossible, because even a huge oceanic disturbance would only cause a large swell in mid-ocean. The wave does not crest and break until it gets to land. Only a serious storm (i.e, a hurricane) can produce such a wave, and even so the size of this wave stretches believability. This, however, is a moot point because there is no storm. There is no scientifically sound reason for this wave to exist. If there were random waves hundreds of feet tall in mid-ocean, capable of capsizing a cruise ship, deep-water ocean travel would never have become possible in ancient times. Thusly, this movie's basic premise is impossible. I can't even articulate my disgust at the gross ignorance it must have taken to create this film. Are they even trying, anymore?",Poseidon

It was tough, but i had to sit through this terrible movie just to see what happens. The actors all look like they are just going through the motions, knowing this is just a bad movie, but hey, we are getting payed. The original was pretty much a serious movie, with some funny parts early. This is just a dopey movie all the way through. None of the main characters, Like Lucas or Russell, do you care at all about. They are all annoying. You almost wish the boat would sink before any of them survive. The CGI isn't the greatest either. Looking at Petersens movie background, i like almost every movie he was involved with like Das Boot and the Perfect storm. But he went south on this one for sure.",Poseidon
298,kevjohn,This Disaster at Sea Disastrous for Filmgoers,2,6 August 2006,"As of August 2006, Poseidon is easily the worst film I have seen for this year. I can think of nothing positive whatsoever to say about this movie. I hesitate to call it a film, because the word ""film"" connotes at least a modicum of artistry. There is none here.** Possible SPOILERS ** I am trying to think of a good starting point to begin to comment about this mess. The opening exposition scenes are not even worth mentioning. So let's get to the meat of this film, the dramatic disaster. To say that the event that is underwhelming would be an understatement. Big wave, ship capsizes, nameless, faceless people get thrown around. The effect is extremely less effective than in ""The Perfect Storm."" Then again, that film took two hours to introduce and develop its characters so that we might have some connection with them. The characters who perished during the initial stages of the disaster were as disposable as the millions these filmmakers wasted on ineffectual special effects.By the time we narrow the cast down to the ten main characters, it is pretty much a given that we the audience have not been given the slightest assumption of intelligence by the screenwriter. The characters are so stock that after a few lines of dialogue from each, it is not difficult to surmise who will live to see the end of this adventure. I guessed correctly in every instance save one: I was unsure whether Richard Dreyfuss' bland character would make it or not. I guessed he wouldn't because I figured it was some kind of unwritten rule that if you cause the death of another character in a movie like this, even to save your own skin (actually ESPECIALLY if it's to save your own skin), your chances of survival must be dramatically reduced. After Dreyfuss shakes Valentin from the leg he is hanging onto for dear life (which as I predicted made Valentin the first one to bite the bullet), I figured Dreyfuss had sealed his own fate as well. Perhaps the screenwriter simply couldn't come up with a creative way to kill him off.Other characters are imperiled here and there, but I am quite frankly not interested enough to detail anything else about this dreck. Suffice to say the young, precocious boy survives of course. Cute little kids never die horrific deaths. Not in the movies at least. His mother, who apparently couldn't be bothered to keep an eye on the little brat for five minutes even during a life-and-death flight from disaster, also survives. She shouldn't have. To balance out this nonsense there are a few selfless acts of heroism here and there from the male leads, with each act more heroic than the one that preceded it.BAH!! It is raising my blood pressure just thinking about this crapfest of a movie. If there is any poetic justice in the world, the screenwriter, director, and producers' yachts will all sink.",Poseidon

Granted it was water, but still something that big would have appeared on a radar...it did in the original. Only thing this movie has going for it is the first 15 minutes. The wave scene and the ship tipping over is very cool, after that...you might as well just turn it off. It is just plain terrible. When is Hollywood going to QUIT WITH THE REMAKES?. If your going to remake a classic...either make it as good as the original or don't even attempt it. Too much emphasis on effects and not enough on character building and script.

302,practicallypeach,Ugh. Just Ugh,3,23 April 2008,"The original was so much better. And it's all because of the characters. The characters in the original had depth and they made you almost want to root for them. In this film, I was just rooting for certain people to die, starting with the daughter. I knew it wasn't going to happen (never would Hollywood kill off the only skinny white girl in a movie) but you can always hope. She was so annoying and rude. If I were the father I'd have straightened her out a long time ago. She needs to show more respect, even if she is an adult. I guarantee she wasn't paying her own way on the cruise. Her father was. She should have at least acted civil with her father in front of others. He may have been a little over protective but he still treated her right. But she treated him like dirt and still expected him to 'understand' her. And when she busted his poker game just because she didn't get what she wanted? I would have slapped her across the face right then and there. Better yet I wouldn't have invited her at all. I'm sorry but I don't like people like that. Children should never roll their eyes or tell their parents off. I, if I were a parent, wouldn't allow it and I'm mad that this man did. If I were that father I would have embarrassed her in front of everyone just like she did him.Elena Gonzalez, a Hispanic girl trying to see her sick brother in New York got me very angry. first of all, she's risking her boy friends job by leaving the cabin that HE snuck her into in order to see her brother JUST because she was bored? Wrong and selfish. He's doing HER a favor and she can't even appreciate it. She's still got to complain about being board. What's he going to do about it? He's working in the kitchen. You expect him to stop what he's doing to entertain you? Oh but it gets better. She's so scared to go into a vent while the water is pouring into a room from every direction. Those men were very good to help her because I would surely leave her butt behind. I don't have time for weaklings when my life is at stake. And she's selfish enough to freeze in the middle of the vent, blocking the men from getting by. Her mentality is that she's so scared that she doesn't care who else dies because of it. I would have dragged her right back to that flooding room so that she could die there. Those men coached her out of that vent, not because they wanted to. It's because they HAD to. Because SHE was blocking the way. Then you've got this kid who wants to wander off for some crazy reason in the upside down boat with fires and floating objects and flooding. Didn't his mother teach him not to wander off? I almost wish he died but of course a child could never die on the big screen. In the first Movie, everyone pulled their weight. Even the fat lady helped by sacrificing her life to save the rest. EVERYONE helped. not these people. There were 2 or 3 strong people who held the group together. The women were virtually useless. Even the little boy had small wrists that were used to unscrew the vent. I hate movies like this where weak people cause trouble because they are scared, or don't want to do this or that or whatever. They put the whole groups lives in danger and it's frustrating for the viewer to even sit through the movie. The daughter goes through this ""No daddy I don't want you to go"" routine. Well what do you expect to be done sweetie? Do you want him to say ""Okay I'll stay and we'll all die together. Nothing's too good for my little angel"". Suspense movies aren't made to amplify cowardice. They are made to show bravery. This movie had almost none. Don't waste your time or money.",Poseidon
303,jaxla,That Sinking Feeling,2,16 May 2006,"It's not just the boat that's sinking, it's Hollywood corporate thinking as well. Which genius decided that remaking a 35 year old disaster film on a $150 million dollar budget, WITHOUT STARS, was a good idea? Aside from all the obvious flaws -- the last minute cutting that eliminated any character development and build up, the phony (however expensive) looking CGI work, the interchangeable starlets in the female roles (Stella, Shelley, we miss you!)-- aside from all that POSEIDON is a monument to the corporate thinking that now rules the studios: it worked once, it'll work again. WRONG. It rarely (Ocean's 11 comes to mind as an exception) works again.Beyond that, the film has some exciting moments BUT THEY DON'T MATTER BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING IS SO HOLLOW. You couldn't care about these characters it your were paid. And there are few if any incidental delights, which the original had plenty of, like the squalling that Stella Stevens and Ernest Borgnine shared, or Shelley Winters' sacrifical swim. It's all swept away in a cloud of CGI. If I see one more HUGE FIREBALL in a film I'm going to grab a fire extinguisher and spray the screen.This should finish the disaster genre until a new group of clueless multi nationals purchase the studios.

The Special F/X were awesome and even it thought that i was too real to see the people getting upside down with the tildal wave.The 1972 version was more of drama with a mix of adventure but this new version surpassed -in my opinion- to the original because this version had more action and intensity with the thrilling scenes.Something that got me desperate and angrier was that kid that disappears every moment; also I was pleased that my favorite characters survived but it was sad one of the last deaths.I recognized some familiar faces like Josh Lucas (Sweet Home Alabama), Kurt Russell (Sky High), Robert Dreyfuss (Jaws), Jacinda Barrett (Urban Legends: Final Cut), Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow), Mike Vogel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003) -will you believe me that I didn't recognize him with the short hair?-, Mia Maestro (Secuestro Express) and the cameo of Stacy Ferguson, well known as Fregie from The Black Eyed Peas.The movie is highly recommendable; too bad that in the US was promoted at last time when outside the US was getting a very good promotion.Anyway I give this: 9/10.",Poseidon

The whole story gets a really quick start. It's sort of like making a fellowship. (""I'm going"", ""Oh, OK, I'm coming with you"", ""We also want to come"" and off they go). Although we are given the main details about the characters, there's still something missing. Most of the time it's nothing but water and fire, water and fire... Then comes the scene which is almost like taken off from Armageddon. And then there's the ""big"" ending, which suffers some holes I think. And boom - The End. I think that such movie would've need some more screening time and a better start. The best acting probably comes from Richard Dreyfuss (he surely has aged), others are just average or below average. I would've also expected some more from Klaus Badelt's music. And why on earth Wolfgang Petersen wants to make movies with sea-themes?

310,madmax_thegamer,Grab a life vest so that you don't go down with this one!,5,20 August 2006,"Though this review may be only one in a sea of others I still feel it is my duty to express to you exactly just how mediocre this movie is. We shall start with the director, Wolfgang Peterson, a man who is familiar with the disaster at sea theme. He previously ventured into the genre with the films Das Boot and The Perfect Storm. While these films are considered by most to be quite well done and enjoyable, Poseidon came off to me as a rushed, sometimes forced and annoying movie. Now I'm not saying that it was entirely bad, it did have a few enjoyable aspects. The actors and actresses are nice to look at for an hour and a half as they get drenched and battered about, and the performances were mostly well done. Many of the action scenes were also enjoyable, my favorite being one in the upside down lobby that is filling with water, which suddenly catches fire. There is also some good music that plays during the final credits. The problem though becomes that if you have seen the original Poseidon Adventure, this one just seems to lack something. The original had adventure, drama and even some comedy, and you felt very connected with the characters as they struggled to reach an escape route from the overturned vessel.In Poseidon however, I never felt really attached to any of the characters in front of me. There wasn't much back-story explanation for them and their reason for being on board. After the first 20 minutes of the movie you are watching them trek from one area to the next and guessing at who will survive and who will perish in a grisly manner. That is another thing; the original film did not focus much on those people who did not survive the wave, while the remake throws a dead body or dead bodies at us every few minutes. What I think you should know is that Poseidon was meant to be a summer action movie and not so much a family adventure film. It has been said that this is not supposed to be an exact remake of the original, more a retelling or re-imagination of the story. I am not saying I hated it, I just expected something else. Wolfgang has successfully stepped up to bat several times in the past and delivered a home run with films like Outbreak, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm, and Troy. Sadly Poseidon seems more like a line drive or a pop fly to the outfield at the most. My advice, rent it or wait until it's featured on a movie channel or TV. Until then watch the original again, or read the book that it is based on.",Poseidon
311,Stevek-48,"Plenty of characters, but no character. Sinks like a stone",3,13 April 2007,"The original was pretty cheesy, but very memorable. You remember the characters and the actors playing them. There was humour, there was terror, there were some very unexpected deaths that really made you feel, because you'd been engaged with these characters for so long. Even the now infamous Shelley Winters swim was very affecting, because it meant something and the death of a character we'd grown to like, who had a mission as the reason for the voyage, was really sad.Here in this 'remake' we have a similar group of characters, but with the possible exception of the young boy, there's nobody to care about. The editing and the effects are incredible, as you'd expect from such a big-budget extravaganza, but the film has no soul. Most of the characters would be interchangeable - and where are the fat ones, the old ones, the not-so- good-looking ones? That's what made the original so good. Not all those who went on the quest to survive were models!The cast do their best, but Kurt Russell, sadly, is not the man to carry a movie any more. I wish he were - he's done it in the past. Richard Dreyfuss as a suicidal gay older man is a bit ridiculous. Did they hide the title of the movie from him when he signed up?And after what was presumably the equivalent of the Shelley Winters drowning death (though she didn't actually drown) there's a thirty second moment of people looking a bit distraught, followed by someone saying 'Come on everyone', and off they go!It would have been better as a cheaper TV movie remake, where some of the faults could be forgiven. So many bits aren't followed through - one character effectively kills another to save himself, which is fair enough in the situation, but he's a character who would have a problem with that, as might the others, but hey, it's OK.I also wondered how come when they're all under water, they manage to see so well. This isn't a swimming pool, it's the ocean - the very salty water ocean, and when was the last time you put salt water in your eyes and could see clearly? Plus they all seem to have the lungs of the cast of The Big Blue, since they can all survive underwater for minutes at a time.And the last scene with the raft and the boat ready to finally sink... a very easy way out. And very unlikely, given the size of the ship, that the sea wouldn't consume them all anyway, as the a ship sinking creates amazing forces.All in all it's a roller-coaster ride that you're just watching, not taking part in.",Poseidon
312,patchworkworld,35 years makes a telling difference...unfortunately for us all,1,28 April 2009,"I saw The Poseidon Adventure as a teen; it was an awesome, enthralling, edge-of-your-seat story with an enormous ability to draw you in and make you care about what happened. Perhaps the best few-word characterization of this ""remake"" is to point out the name change. ""The Poseidon"" is not awesome, enthralling, or in the least able to get anyone not lobotomized or non-severely ADD interested; it's no adventure It's also stupefyingly moronic. The opening ""ship"" sequence is so bad I blinked and started laughing (and kept right on chuckling till it went away). Anyone who's ever actually had a life, been anywhere, done anything, probably prefers real to CGI because even the best CGI looks SO fake as soon as it depicts anything in motion...even as a still shot THIS CGI looks like a glamorized cartoon panel of a totally exaggerated boat...not a single line or angle isn't so badly misdone that it doesn't come across as pure caricature. The non-CGI special effects are uniformly bad, though not in that same way; they are so pointless in the movie context you'd be far more entertained watching a disconnected series of random explosions, crashes, etc on YouTube. ""Pointless"" in fact is a good descriptive for the entire film: for example many have mentioned Dreyfuss' gay character, but the ONLY way the audience knows he's gay is from a single line in which he says his lover has left him for someone else using the word ""he"" instead of ""she"", IE the information is utterly pointless in adding nothing to story or character or even that scene. Another example is the utter hash work made of Shelly Winters' incredible scenes as the now old and fat ex-champion swimmer who saves the life of the guy making them all keep going and then dies in one of the most heartrending scenes of TPA; the remake's two possible replacement scenes are: 1. A long swim through an underwater corridor filled with debris in which stupid stowaway chick gets her clothing hooked on some wires and bashes her head, then her dead body is towed out and CPR'd to no avail and simply left like carrion or 2. ridiculously overbearing dad disappears, reappears in an underwater control room, hits a few buttons and switches, goes all glassy eyed, assumes a 'deadguy' facial expression, jerks in a bizarre fashion twice, lets out a bubble of air, and clearly DIES....and then miraculously comes back to life (with absolutely no change from the 'dead' facial rictus BTW) to push one more button as his body is moved around by the currents inside the submerged ship.hat kind of stupidity characterized a LOT of the so-called action...kid clearly drowns, and then WOW guy who was nowhere near him suddenly pops up obviously far FAR too late but with live kid! Amazing! Guy's face is already underwater and they still need to remove ALL THE SCREWS screws from a ventilation shaft cover to get out, but he's JUST FINE by the time they FINALLY get the cover up. (Sort of the prevailing idea that all we have to do is flip some switch at the last microsecond and anything we've screwed up will instantly be perfectly OK. No nuclear explosion, no eco-catastrophe, no problem of any kind...) And of course, the callousness, the viciousness, the absolute lack of any redeeming anything about what little we did see of characters...there was absolutely nothing in TPA like the scene where one char deliberately kills another to save himself, and it was a tremendous jolt to watch it done as a matter of course here. Similarly the endless scenes of piles of bodies cooked, drowned, etc, with no reaction to speak of from any character OR THE AUDIENCE. 35 years, and we've gone from horror ho-hum at such things. 35 years, and we've gone from great real people chars you care about in a terrifying situation requiring all kinds of horrific efforts and soul bearing (leavened with humor all the more hilarious because of its contrast to the intensity before and after) to moronic unrealistic CGI, interchangeable dummy chars, and brain-dead ""action"".I checked the run-times, thinking this turkey must have been significantly shorter because of the blatant difference in any plot and character development between it and the real movie (TPA '72) but it's only 9 minutes shorter. So much for the idea that this is SUPPOSED to be a jump from one idiocy to the next, we have no time to do anything with plot and characters idea.",Poseidon
313,Arirang2009,The boat came and gone...,1,26 May 2010,"A movie you will for sure start to refer to is The Perfect Storm. Oh well, this one is just a matter about size, a bit bigger, higher and more luxury... and a bit more boring. I would just to say that this movie isn't a remake of The Perfect Storm. It's a remake of an another movie, done before 1980's. Secondly, you will start to wonder; ""where the **** did that wave came from?"" That's one thing i was thinking on when i saw it - a fantastic wave in that size - 150 feet tall - just appears from nowhere, it more looks like a swell wave from a meteor or something very big and heavy that dropped somewhere near the boat from the sky. And for that matter, wouldn't a big, single wave like this one in the film - been visible on their radar?And here's where the plot holes starts. First of all, a wave that big can't appear from a mirror surface on a sea. In the movie The Perfect Storm, the fishing boat at least where in a triangle-drama with furious hurricanes. With other words, waves where building up on each other, and created a giant wave, so called a ""freak-wave"". There you have the natural explanation to their disaster. The problem making these kind of movies isn't the CGI (which where terrible as well in this one), no it's the fact that you really have to make sure nature laws really behaves correctly. Because the audience will for SURE start to wonder why things happens and discuss it - and thats a important part of the whole movie! I got the feeling they putted this wave here just to make sure an accident should appear. Just to make sure the boat rolls as it did. Just to make sure the actress will scream and wave with their hands. The rest of the movie was just the same old boring happenings. I mean, com on, if five fishermen on a 30fot long saber fish boat can hold more dramatic and completely suck the air out from the audience for more than 40min, then why can't a 250m+ long cruiser do the same thing? I tell you why. It's because when you're starting messing around with the mother nature's laws, and not checking simple details on the boat, such as stabilizers and so on, then folks will start talking about how impossible the movie was, instead of being hold by stunning nature looking events, and that is why this movie fails so much.

314,godfather199,How Dare They? Drown ME Please...,1,12 May 2006,"Tell me. Is Hollywood totally OUT of original ideas??? Here we have another remake of a classic movie, and falls flat in almost every department.Let me start with the classic 1972,""The Poseidon Adventure."" Dated? Yeah. Campy and cheesy? Maybe. Special effects. OK for that time. But you CARED about the characters. As the great Jackie Gleason once said, ""When you get an audience to care about the characters, you're two thirds of the way home."" In the original, we had an all star cast, playing great characters, that we actually cared about. The Rosen's. The Rogo's, Rev. Scott, Susan and Robyn, etc. It was a fantastic action/drama, that had you feeling like you were a part of it all. Wonderful.Now, we come to the remake. Characters we don't care about, which kills the drama, the action, the comedy, the sentiment, the interest. What we're left with, is a one hour and 40 minute special effect fest. Doesn't work. During the film, I took 3 cigarette breaks, and one soda break. By the end of the movie, I wanted the ship to sink, and everyone to die. So there.Do yourself a favor. Save your time, your money, and get the original '72' version. Then you'll see something worth watching. I give this movie a 1 out of 10, only because there wasn't a choice of zero on the vote.This movie isn't a sinker. It's a stinker...-VM",Poseidon
315,martine-12,Decent but not as good as the original,5,9 August 2006,"Although the movie which this is based on is as old as I am I can still say that this movie is not as good as the one from 1972.Sure, the cast is talented, the effects are impressive and the pacing is well done. The entire movie is, in fact, well done. It's just not inspired. Or inspiring for that matter.The script is quite basic, although in the movies defense, it doesn't have to be especially complicated as the environment should be the key element here. There are still certain parts that needs to be sharp, the dialogue for instance. And the characters.Again, it's well done but nothing that you remember years after you saw the movie. And with a movie like this you really should remember quite a bit.One thing I have to give the move makers is the fact that people die, even the ones you didn't expect to die. Then again, the ones you expect to die, dies as well (and at times exactly the way you thought they would).The laws of physics are set aside when the script calls for it which really is a shame. I can think of a number of settings in an Atlantic cruiser turned up-side-down without making stuff up.If the movie had been just a disaster flick without all the touchy feely interaction between the characters, as they are to uninteresting to make that part work, I think it'd been a better film. Or the other way around; a lot more interesting characters and emotions and less focus on the environment.As of now, it ends up in between these chairs and the end result is a rather bland movie that didn't impress very often.",Poseidon
316,chinesefan,Realistic and Entertaining !!!,8,14 May 2006,"After reading the earlier comments here, I am quite skeptical about this movie. Being a great fan of the 70's version, I saw this trailer, although quite impressed, the poor cast nearly put me off. I thought to myself, it can't be bad with this director and why would they take such a risk if there is nothing better than the original ? After reading so many comments here about the poor characters development and since hardly anyone criticized the action and effect scenes, I went for it. After all, the most important aspect in such movie is the effects. I am so worried that it will use CGI effects like most Hollywood movies today. To my surprise, it turned out to be GOOD !! The opening scene is a winner. The one take shot showing the all round of the ship far and near is memorable. Make sure you don't enter late. The ship is real, unlike the one in Titanic. Sorry, somehow you tend to compare it with The Poseidon Adventure and Titanic. Those who felt there are short of action scenes in Titanic or if the exterior of the ship in Titanic is unrealistic will be satisfied with this one. At least, here you see where all the money went(although I am not sure if this movie cost more than Titanic or not). Another big surprise for me is, just like The Poseidon Adventure, the shots are all so real, without any noticeable computer effects except for one single fast scene when it showed the interior of the ship when a girl victim fell all the way down. All the other scenes are so real, nothing like this in a Hollywood movie since The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. Compared to the 70's P.A, this one has more and better exciting incidents, faster paced all the way till the end. Although technically, I don't know whether all the interior settings are based correctly on a real ship, all the incidents are better and more exciting here except that we do not have a memorable one like Shelley Winters' swimming scene. To compare the 2 films, in brief, the 70's one has 3 most outstanding scenes that we don't find it here. That is when the ship went upside down and many people fell all right down to the ceiling, climbing the Christmas tree, and Shelley Winters's swimming scene. In this one, we don't have any of such memorable scenes that you will remember after a few years and there is not a single song fully performed like the original's memorable one. The casts and characters here are not as outstanding but to say that the dialogue and characters are weak is misleading. The movie maybe a bit short but all the impressive settings and actions, non-stop one after another is worth the ticket and the time. I may not like this movie as much as I like the The Poseidon Adventure the first time but I liked this far better than the Titanic. Those who liked disasters movie will like this. Those who have seen the original and The Towering Inferno will not get disappointed. Those who have not seen the original will enjoy it much more. Those who hate to see fake computer effects like in most movies must not miss it.",Poseidon

The acting was horrible, the storyline weak and full of holes and the continuity was bad.I find it interesting that the start of the movie goes straight into the New Years Eve Party and we have no idea who the main characters are...such as small bits of information about their lives as told in the original and the made for TV miniseries. Then they go straight into the tsunami and then the escape. There was no mention of a rescue or about who might come rescue them. I also thought it was strange how easily they decided to ""sacrifice"" valentin the waiter..without any thought, emotion or remorse, yet cried uncontrollably when Elena drowned....On the whole, I wasted my money on this film and will not bother to rent it when released on DVD.

319,Charly-25,Who will Survive? NOT the audience!,1,15 May 2006,"Paul Gallico's novel, published in 1969, is not so much a disaster novel, as it is a grim character study of people caught up in a disaster. The book is gripping in it's savage brutality. The character's are stripped of all pretensions, and self delusions. They reveal more and more of their inner selves as they climbed further and further into the ship.The 1972 film only hinted at this. The Hallmark TV film, only had conventional characters who reacted in conventional and unsurprising ways to the various challenges.Now, Wolfgang Peterson has stripped the story of all humanity and created what amounts to a two hour film in which the audience watches a very large kinetic sculpture designed to destroy itself. The actors seem to be more like cogs and wheels in that sculpture than human beings. There is no character development and no plot. Yes, the special effects are fantastic, especially as the wave strikes and capsizes the ship. The sets are stunning but sterile, and the action is absolutely nonstop. And THAT is all the film has going for it. Peterson seems to be catering to those with minds only developed enough to pay attention to movement and pretty lights, like a small baby watching a mobile hung over its crib.Many of the actors are quite good. We know that because of their past bodies of work. Unfortunately, in this film they may as well have had animated wax figures playing their roles. True, the Irwin Allen film had a number of overblown and hammy performances, but those actors at least had something to bite into. A lobotomized Frances Farmer would have been able to handle these empty insignificant characters. In interviews, Richard Dreyfuss commented that he did this film for money. I certainly understand that! He definitely didn't do it because it was a great part. He played a gay man, suicidal and depressed because his lover has left him. Unfortunately his being gay seemed rather gratuitous. Publicity for the film stated that he suddenly discovers he very much wants to live. This also seemed gratuitous.Kurt Russell plays the role of a former NYC firefighter and mayor and seems to have fallen into the real life role of aging action hero making way for younger action hero. Kevin Dylan plays a character named Lucky Larry, who seemed obviously patterned after computer game icon Leisure Suit Larry. His character would have been quite enjoyable had he not been so reprehensible.As far as the rest of the cast went, you may as well have taken them like so many Barbie and Ken dolls, popped off their heads and interchanged them.The costumes were pretty much what you might expect to see aboard ship on New Year's Eve, but nothing strikingly great. The only one that stood out was the singer (who I understand is a member of The Black-eyed Peas). It was so awful, I mistook her for a Charo impersonator. But at least it stood out.One thing I must give the filmmakers an A+ on. The underwater shots of the ship were extraordinarily impressive. The attention to detail with all the debris and parts of the ship breaking away seemed very realistic. I do have a final question, however (and a nit-picky one at that). Do they no longer bolt down tables and other large furniture aboard luxury liners?",Poseidon

If there had been a little more attention paid to the characters, I would say that this was a *bad* take-off on the old ""Love Boat"" series. It does not even deserve that comparison. ""Special effects for the sake of special effects"" is how I would more accurately describe the ""plot"". To be sure, the original was not a masterpiece; but it was entertaining and had much more of a story than this.And there were even parts of the movie which one may find offensive.

I had a few problems with it, though; mostly the ""main"" character, Josh McConaughey-- oh, sorry, Lucas. He's a pretty dull actor, and I've thought so since seeing him in Sweet Home Alabama. Luckily, however, he wasn't too distracting, and did quite well in a few parts. Richard Dreyfuss was actually a welcome surprise; I mean, I knew he was going to be in this movie, and he looks more haggard than ever (he's younger than my dad and he looks like he could be 80!!), but he did fine, and his character was not the jerk I was suspecting he would portray.

325,rmgentile,Slick but Boring,4,25 November 2006,"It's hard to say why this movie was such a thud compared to the first one. There were some scenes which were improvements on the original, but the original was just a hands-down classic, from Pamela Sue Martin's long skirt converting into a jumpsuit to Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens' painful and tumultuous love scenes to Gene Hackman's classic camp monologue as he hangs from the main hatch over the pit of fire. And the list goes on...This movie sustains none of the character development like the first one did. The chemistry between characters is totally lacking, and the dialog is uncompelling. The direction and dialog in the first movie were pretty bad, but there was still a depth to the characters' stories.Where the second movie prevails is in its production values and special effects. The gory deaths are impressive and the ship is more of an inferno than a watery grave. Extending the scene in the ballroom was a good idea - the ocean felt bigger and the hopelessness of the situation and gruesomeness of those character's deaths in the heart of the ship was even sadder. Again though, there's just no substitute for Carol Linley (Nonnie Parry) singing ""Morning After."" They really should have done a cool reprisal of that song in this movie - more homages to the previous film probably would have garnered a larger audience.I saw it - I might have liked it if I hadn't seen the original when I was 10.

Until i realised it was a remake of a film i saw when i was younger but never knew the name of, The Poseidon Adventure! So i decided to watch it if not for old times sake and i can honestly say i was pleasantly surprised. The problem with most disaster films is they're clichéd, unrealistic and rather tedious to watch. This film i felt was rather enjoyable. The special effects were well done but never over done or needless, the film brings up a series of events that are rather sad and brutally honest. The actors did well and play their roles simply and efficiently but my one criticism is were never lead to really feel any affection towards the characters in the film, which i suppose makes the film move quicker in places but you didn't really care who died next! I felt the director did a sound job on the film. It was easy to watch whilst being entertaining, it was slick in places and held a steady pace throughout and i wasn't bored or finding the film tedious for one minute in the cinema.If you fancy watching a reasonably entertaining movie for one and a half hours then watch it.

I mean if you watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Rocky"" and then ""Terminator"" you don't tally up a general scoring for all, they are totally different films.So the acting is as required in such a film and the special effects are very good.

When I first rented it, I watched it Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday night, three times in a row! Yes, it was that good.I think the characters really connect and play their roles well. They all reacted to their different conflicts really well. I'm a sucker for disaster movies, and this one did not disappoint.I know a lot of people didn't like this one compared to the original. Well, I confess that I have never seen the original, though I have every intention of doing so, but I don't think this remake was trying to live up to the original.

I'm writing this several months after viewing this flick, and to be honest, its still not that memorable. I don't care how many people try to make this out NOT to be a remake, but I ask you to return to my mathematical equation above for the reason.The flick had no character development what so ever, thus it didn't matter who died. Now the film THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE had many enduring, and endearing characters worth remembering. Has Hollywood stooped so low that now every film has to have the token this, and the token that. You had some really good and talented actors, playing really bad parts.The CGI effects for this flick were great, but good FX do not a movie make. The new SS POSIEDON looks clean and cold. No character, but a cookie cutter of every other modern cruise ship; and with all its modern technology, couldn't detect a huge rogue wave coming straight for her. Now the SS Posiedon in the POSIEDON ADVENTURE, was a character unto herself. You knew the ship's back story and its certainly near future was already decided, but she had character. That's not something that you can get from a computer driven image.Let's see Hollywood go back to using scale models of ships in sea disaster flicks, rather that saving the budget and go with a computer image.The flick is not worth seeing on the big screen.

331,bending_spoons2000,Disaster Movie 101 (not even in a funny way),2,30 June 2011,"This movie is basically disaster movie 101 with fancy special effects and a script not even worthy of being used as toilet paper.If you are in anyway familiar with the disaster movie genre you will recognise the under developed and badly scripted ""escapees"" without so much as a glance. First of all you have the obligatory bad dude who (in true Hollywood style) stays around just long enough for you to hate him and then gets his karma in the grimmest of ways. Then you have the father/daughter/future son in law triangle...which incidentally must have come from a scriptwriter very familiar with 1998's Armageddon. The mother and bratty kid who you wish would just die...but this is Hollywood and in Hollywood the kid never dies (however annoying he may be!). You also have a few ""expendables"", who either get badly injured or die. Unfortunately this script just lacked the estranged husband/wife/son/daughter (which the disaster reunites) and the dog (you ever notice how many disaster movies feature a dog, who incidentally NEVER dies?) Sadly the very fact that this movie actually tried to take itself seriously with all the 160 million dollars (which must have gone solely on Kurt Russel and the special effects) gave it a feeling of something much more than it was and made it impossible for me to enjoy it as a perverse comedy like so many other disaster movies.The corny lines, heroism, strong men and weepy women just made me want to hurl heavy objects at the TV. I know disaster movies take a lot of license with physics (heres looking at you atomic twister), but seriously, SERIOUSLY...if a large ship sinks and you are in the vicinity then you go bye bye, thanks to the rather large and powerful suction effect created by a sinking ship. Unfortunately the sinking ship physics is just one of a million. The script writers clearly don't have a clue about how pressure functions or electricity, let alone the mechanics of a ship.*sigh* I still hold onto the hope that one day someone will actually come up with an original, well thought out disaster movie, which is devoid of all the sentimental clap trap and god awful stereotypes so prevalent in anything coming out of Hollywood.Would it be too much to ask that script writers actually treat their suspense loving audiences with the dignity and intelligence to which they should be afforded?

333,Drogan-Hex,Watchable,6,26 March 2021,"PoseidonDirecting: Wolfgang Petersen did a not bad job directing this movie, but he did miss a few critical aspects at the beginning of the movie when Poseidon flipped over. His vision of the movie was more focused on the personnel survival which caused some minor hiccups in the storyline. Production: There are 5 producers, 4 executive producers, 3 co-producers and 1 associate producer. The investment, energy and resources put in this movie were so extensive that it made the movie watchable. I hail the production efforts and team for what they did in this movie. Script: having Mark Protosevich as a screenplay writer was nowhere near being a good idea. So much investment was put into this movie, the least they can do is hire a good screenplay writer not someone who has never written a screenplay before. The movie started with a dull script, and it all went downhill from there. I am sure this was a major reason why the movie failed to deliver. Acting: Acting was fair, I would argue that the actor selection was not to the point, but the overall acting was not that bad. Kurt Russel could have done a much better job than he did. Josh Lucas and Emmy Rossum would have had some impressive scenes with a better script. Cinema and sound: This is where the movie excelled! The visual effects, the sound, the cinematography was impressive to say the least. Klaus Badelt Did an awesome job with the score, a great pick by the production team.

The characters are nothing more than a crew of puppets moved about a sinking ship with absolutely NO personality. The characters are so underdeveloped it really gives the audience (ME) no valid reason to care if these people come out alive! The acting is bad and suffers extremely from just a plain bad script. It seems that certain characters (Richard Dreyfuss) are implanted in this story just as fill-ins and others (Kurt Russell and Emmy Rossum) lack chemistry all together.

335,TrueTenorOne,Not as bad as it seems,7,12 June 2007,"This movie got some pretty good reviews and some pretty bad reviews, and almost everything in between. Me, I gave it a pretty good review, and I will tell you why. It is an action movie, which historically are never that great anyway (Star Wars and Indiana Jones being some of the few exceptions), so you can't expect much more than what you got. It's a remake of one of the great action films of all-time, so you can't try to compare the two. The bad reviews were based primarily on these two factors, which to me is unfair. You should take this movie for what it is by itself, and when you do you will find that it is not nearly as bad as some think.The story is a pretty cliché action plot, with a diverse group of survivors banding together to find a way off of the ship, which is now floating upside down. There's the rugged, ""I work alone"" leader, the older, more-experienced man, his daughter, and her fiancée, the pretty lady and her child, the foreign stowaway, and the old loner. The main thing that drives this story is the acting. Each actor knows who their character is and does nothing more, or less, than what is required. There is a lot of screaming, crying, and general fearfulness, but there would be in a situation like this. The only actor who overdoes his character is Kevin Dillon, but that's exactly how his character is. What prevents the movie from being another smash popcorn hit is, above all else, the writing. By trying to avoid being cliché in the script, the writers in fact made it worse, giving characters original lines that made them seem less intelligent than they really are. However, in the final action sequence, I found myself holding my breath along with the characters, struggling not to drown myself. And when an action film can make you feel like you're right there in the action, than it is a job well done. Certainly not great, but well done. 7/10",Poseidon

Bear in mind that it is presented as an action film and we don't go and see those expecting Oscar winning performances.Having said that,it is clear that Wolfgang Petersen wants to get straight into the action and as a result the film feels rushed disjointed for the first half. After that we can concentrate on the escape story and the main characters.I will agree with others that character development has been sacrificed for the sake of special effects and action which is a shame.For example,the gambler and the single mum had a real chemistry in the few lines they shared early on which could have been built up. Richard Dreyfus's character and the stowaway girl had a rapport between them that could also have been made more of. Even just 10 minutes extra pre-capsize running time could have added so much more to this.But anyway,for me,the team of actors really comes together when they are struggling to escape the ventilation shaft which is filling with water and after that it is easier to care about their fate.The film is,of a course,a special effects showcase and the team have done well with these.We get a shipwide view of the capsize although I would also have liked to see more of the main characters. And in their escape through the ship they face fire,water,dead ends,drops, dismemberment by giant propeller blades and even when they find a life raft they are threatened by the ship keeling over on them.Petersen has kept his team of survivors only just ahead of the rising water all through their escape which keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat and the relatively short running time is justified in this sense.So yeah-worth going to see but not a patch on the original! Remember-go watch it as ab action movie and you won't be as likely to be disappointed. The are far worse ways to pass 1 hour 40 minutes.",Poseidon
338,ragou,Very bad,1,2 April 2008,"I'm tired of such movies. No matter how they have been done. Instead I'm 55 I know the achievements of our age. How a man being in the middle of the ocean is speaking with his cellphone? A cell is about 5 kilometers to the next cell. I assume that the cruiser has satellite connection herself and gives connection to the passengers. That's very good. But how an sophisticated ship isn't tracked every few minutes by the GPS. Or may be it was a secret journey. If I am in trouble with my car, my men know it after 2-3 seconds no matter where I am. A big wave unnoticed - this is ridiculous. At last there is such a device called ""radar"" and this device will recognize a boat in 150 miles range. But today we couldn't detect the WAVE. When you watch a film like this you start to think - What is happening with American Film Industry? Lack of ideas may be? P.S Sorry for my English I am Bulgarian.",Poseidon
339,brimblemeister,Not bad!,6,12 June 2006,"Well I only saw this film because The Omen was full so this seemed like the next best, and to be honest I was quite surprised. I expected it to be a shocker and although it was no epic it wasn't too bad.The acting is pretty poor and Kurt Russell has seen better days in the acting world but the effects held it together so it remained entertaining enough. I totally agree with everyone some parts were a bit dull and predictable (I know its a remake) but I still managed to carry on watching since their was just enough of a storyline to keep me in my seat. If this was made on a $50 dollar budget i think it would have been pretty damn poor but it wasn't and you can tell, the effects are superb and you can tell massive effort has been put into this (and money) which compensates for a pretty lifeless script and dialect. The cheesy lines annoyed me because they weren't needed and some people laughed at them in the cinema when I was there which I can understand. But like me if you go to watch this film bored, and just expecting it to be your typical high budget, over exaggerated Hollywood blockbuster, which is plainly what it is then I don't think you will be overly disappointed! The script could have been improved and the cast isn't great but the films OK and think its receiving some harsh criticism! Don't get too excited about watching it, but it should entertain a fair few",Poseidon
340,tjay1777,The Critics Are Wrong As Usual!!!,10,13 May 2006,"People, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!!!! I just got back from seeing Poseidon, and it was awesome. You couldn't ask for more action in a film than this. Every second is filled with action, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.As for people complaining about bad acting, bad plot, etc, I'm just wondering if they saw this same movie I did or just making crap up. The acting was top notch in here. Overall, the entire cast gave excellent performances, but with the 2 main standouts being Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas. They were perfect for the roles they played in this type of movie. Whoever did the casting, I give you credit. You really know how to pick your people. Oh, and Richard Dreyfuss is getting really old yes, but he shows he can still do some heavy action stuff. And as for the plot, yes, there is one. A big giant wave crashes into a big ship, people are hurt and killed, and a few try to find a way to escape, and they do. There you go. And what did you want, another Titanic, which runs about 3 hours long. Heck no, I would think not. This movie runs a good short 98 minutes, so you can't really complain about that. The movie does not drag on, and gets to the action right away.So all in all, I highly recommend this action masterpiece to everyone who enjoys an awesome action movie filled with stunning visual effects and scenery. You can really tell that the 140 million budget for this film was used all the way and was not a waste. Great acting, great visual effects, great cast, great plot, overall GREAT! Go see. You will not be disappointed!! :)",Poseidon

Stupid characters, stupid behavior... Captain saying ""I don't know what it was, but probably it was a terrifying killer-wave"" (again, it's our translation). It really reminded me another stupid movie. Day After Tomorrow. But there were some cool special effects there and here... Even this wave was not that terrible, and all smelled computer effects. Tons of dead bodies also didn't add any horror. Ah, and that gay-old-man! Hahaha! I won't spoil anything, but believe me, there's nothing to spoil.

342,WaxBellaAmours,"Soggy, joyless remake has no high camp and all it's personality in the ship's elevators",3,23 September 2006,"It's hard to believe we needed another trip to Poseidon, considering the 1972 original gave us everything in the most extraneous (and extraneously campy) mold. Everything from endless water-smothered shots of over-periled shipwreck survivors manically yelping and stumbling for what seemed like an eternity to one of the most fascinating battles of former Oscar-winners (in this case, Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine) doing their gallant, goliath-sized battle of menacing overacting that has become one of the most enjoyable and laughed-upon symbol of misguided performing on film. It gave us nothing we we're expecting and yet way more than we ever needed, both a model and a major black mark on the popularity of the high-concept disaster epics of the kitsch 70's Hollywood.Now, Wolfgang Peterson's predictably high-priced remake at least seems like it wants to be taken seriously, and therein lays this ""Poseidon's"" inevitable disaster. A lack of high camp would have been forgivable if there was any sense of storytelling or personality, but most of all what makes this film just plain awful is that, despite the endless cash displayed on screen, there is really nothing here: the movie spends no time letting anything live or breathe (though you don't really need any oxygen when you're made out of cardboard), as all the characters, the numerous perilous ventures and the barrages of special effects all feel like window dressing hanging in thin air.Where as the original ""Poseidon"" gave a shining (if perhaps unintentional) example of the Hollywood exec's congratulatory campy counter-programming to the auteur-driven artful 70's cinematic renaissance, this ""Poseidon"" is a model of Hollywood just wanting to get it's ""product"" finished and out on the market as soon as possible. ""Poseidon"" wastes absolutely no time getting to its central ploy, as we're only fifteen minutes in when the wave hits, and we're barely at the hour-and-a-half mark by the time the credits start rolling. Even that truly massive, curtain-like wave, where its appearance and immediate consequences is the reason most people will buy tickets, barely gets a minute of screen time.Given, explaining the plot seems like trying to explain how to move spaces on a board game, only this is MUCH quicker. For the first few minutes, each of the major characters makes their as-quick-as-an-eclipse entrance: there's the firefighting hero/former mayor of New York (Kurt Russel), his teenage daughter and the film's token damsel-in-high-shrieking-distress (Emmy Rossum, who's also a poor victim of the filmmakers obsession with her cleavage), her boyfriend (Mike Vogel) a grimacing, resourceful mystery man (Josh Lucas) who becomes this disparate bunch's swift navigator, a pretty lower-class drifter (Mia Maestro), a handyman cook (Freddy Rodriguez), and, of course, a hot single mom (Jacinda Barret) and her son (Jimmy Bennet, the film's quite obligatory precocious-child-in-peril). And let's not forget Richard Dreyfuss, who has clearly thrown any hope of a decent post-scrip career out the window, playing a white-collar, soon-to-be-divorced sad duck whose contemplation of suicide makes him the first one to witness the dreaded ""Rogue Wave"", which instantly hits the titanic-sized Poseidon and sets the ""story"" in motion.As soon as the wave turns the ship over and the few survivors start their perilous journey to make it to safe haven at the top of the ship (or, really, the bottom, as the ship of course is flipped over), the movie from then on just becomes a maze of different loops and tunnels that feels like a lot of strenuous work for no reason whatsoever. Various problems, ""daunting"" obstacles emerge and then are solved in a very precise manner, some of the major cast members get their emphatic death scenes (ones that truly do sink) and endless flushes of water pervasively engulf the camera. There's plenty of spectacle but not an iota of interest by anyone involved: it just seems like everybody wants to get done with it as soon as possible, and that perfunctory lack of engagement easily transfers to the audience.Given, it's hard to blame the filmmakers (who here admittedly do a pretty earnest, workmanlike routine) when their working with what is easily one of the worst screenplays to be used in a long while. The only thing with personality is a ship elevator (one of the moodiest and most glamorously futuristic elevators to grace the silver screen in years), and all the scenes run in to each other with little relation to one another, as the characters just swoop from one area of the ship to the next till they find the film's hazy finish line. Teenage characters spin out lines like ""Why don't you quit your consistently patronizing attitude!"", a ship official's response to a massive and insuperable wave is ""Something's off"", people have names like Dylan Johns, and for some reason bent, broken stairways seem to provide the only obstacles (besides the water, of course) in almost every situation.The ultimate downer, though, is that the film can't even be enjoyed for its failures, as it's both humorless on the intentional and unintentional side (today, these big-spectacle blockbusters usually find their chuckles from one aspect or the other). Perhaps the problem here is that, in a complete reversal of the original, the cast remarkably under-acts (nor can they provide any acting chops when they don't really have characters to play). The only sign of quasi-homage to ""The Poseidon Adventure"" lies in Kevin Dillon's performance as the sleazy, drunken jackass ""Larry Lucky"", who gets his inevitable just desserts, a sign that at least someone is having a little fun replaying the original, even if it doesn't ignite any Borgnine-level chuckles we are so thirsty for. But all in all, by the time the film's mercifully brief running time ends, this soggy and joyless remake can't do anything but sink gracefully from our not-so-distant memory.",Poseidon
343,oneshortkat,Poseidon - Imagine without the dialogue,7,13 May 2006,"This movie wasn't horrible, as some other people have stated, in my opinion it's a little better than mediocre. If you ignore the clichéd dialogue and let yourself get caught up in the action and intensity of the scenes then it's a much better film. As Kurt Russell said about Wofgang Peterson's other film Troy, I bet if you watch this film with the dialogue, not the music, off it would be a completely different film. The acting in this film was terrific except for Jimmy Bennet and Jacinda Barret. Maybe if they had been given more dialogue, I would've liked them better, but what lines they were given were delivered...not so good. I felt that the best actors in the whole film were Emmy Rossum and Josh Lucas. They really made me feel for their characters and I wanted them to survive this horrific ordeal. The special effects were the best I've seen in any film. The capsize was amazing to see on the big screen. My stomach tensed up the whole time. I know that there were quite a few scenes cut out before the final release and I hope when Poseidon is released on DVD it will have a directors cut. Maybe then I would empathize with all of the characters.",Poseidon

346,andrez_iffy,Poseidon: that sinking feeling...,4,2 June 2006,"VOYAGE OF THE BLAND: 'POSEIDON' ROLLS AGAIN.By Andrez Bergen (de-VICE / The Daily Yomiuri).Director: Wolfgang Petersen. Cast: Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum, Richard Dreyfuss, Jacinda Barrett, Jimmy Bennett.If you're going to rebake a disaster movie of such epic schlock-chic value as The Poseidon Adventure, you'd better put together a mighty fine recipe.From the histrionics of Shelley Winters and the ham-fisted, macho posturing of Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine to the (literal) depth-charge of disco just past the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, the 34-year-old yarn had it all.Along with Irwin Allen's next production, The Towering Inferno, it kick-started a '70s genre of faded-star catastrophe movies like Earthquake, Meteor and Airport '75.When the ""Master of Disaster"" died in 1991 of natural causes, it looked like the calamity flick had passed away with Allen. But The Day After Tomorrow changed all that two years ago.Which brings us to this retelling of the upended ship saga.Again an official Irwin Allen production, Poseidon has been relaunched (with a streamlined moniker) by Allen's surviving spouse Sheila, who incidentally appeared in a supporting role in the original movie.This remodeled vessel boasts a completely different passenger list. Josh Lucas, fresh from Stealth, stars alongside Emmy Rossum (Phantom of the Opera) and Kurt Russell.Russell last featured in an Irwin Allen production 40 years ago, in an episode of Lost In Space.At the helm is German director Wolfgang Petersen. While his tendency in Hollywood has been the production of leaden projects like The Perfect Storm--another big wave saga--and Troy, this is still the man who directed the excellent, suspenseful U-boat drama Das Boot twenty-odd years ago.Poseidon evinces a partial resurgence in his directorial stride. Under Petersen's control the movie is mostly tight, and at times visually mesmerizing.For those of you who've somehow missed the multiple TV reruns of The Poseidon Adventure over the past three decades, the plot of that, and its remake, goes something like this: It's New Year's Eve out there in the big blue yonder. An ocean liner called the Poseidon is carrying hundreds of wealthy passengers on a cruise most people in the audience will never be able to afford, when a rogue wave chugs out of nowhere and turns everything upside down.The remainder of the story seems to have something to do with Darwin and the endurance of the fittest, as the survivors attempt to escape a pleasure cruiser that's turned immense, partially floating coffin.In the new version, former firefighter Robert Ramsey (Russell), his daughter Jennifer (Rossum) and her fiancé team up with hard-nosed gambler Dylan Johns (Lucas), an annoying suicidal gay pensioner (Richard Dreyfuss), a single mother with her geeky son, an alcoholic card shark named ""Lucky"" and a Catholic stowaway with claustrophobia.Some of these people, of course, have ""doomed to die"" tattooed across their foreheads from the outset.But who really cares? The acting itself borders on the bland--Russell is workmanlike yet distracted, Lucas can't decide if he's earnest or arrogant, and Rossum fades into the upside down interior fixtures.Petersen has to bear some responsibility for this lackadaisical effort.Most of the blame rests with scriptwriter Mark Protosevich, whose interpretation of the Paul Gallico novel renders the characters half-baked. He's also completely blind to all the potential elements--dramatic as well as witty--that this topsy-turvy setting could have engendered.And let's give it a break with the bodies.We know a lot of people are dead. We've seen their demise quite graphically over the course of events, so why persist with dozens of corpses in various states of decay? If realism is claimed, then why don't we just throw Protosevich's whole take on the story out of the port-hole, revive the actors, wring-out a decent script, and start again? Please?",Poseidon
347,Diodorino-Rotolo1,"Read this, and you'll know how bad this movie is!",2,5 July 2006,"NOOOOO!!! This film was absolute trash! I see 'Poseidon' as a dire insult to the 1972 version. There are so many elements of it that are just left out! Where's the diologue? Where's the interplay between characters? Where's the flavour?!!!The movie is about a ship called Poseidon, and is hit by a rogue wave. The ship capsizes, and it becomes a struggle for the passengers to get out of the unstable boat. At least the original one wasn't full of bulls**t! For example, the helium-filled balloons that are floating in the ballroom seem to change to normal air-filled balloons.And it all happens so fast! I swear, only five minutes into the movie, Poseidon capsizes. There is no introduction for the characters, and throughout the movie, I didn't even know their fictional names!And it is so predictable! Instantly when I saw that drunken cowboy walking over that makeshift bridge they made, I knew he was going to fall off. And he did! The guy gets crushed by an elevator - and I predicted that too! The ship sinks just after they get out - yes, you guessed it, I saw that coming as well.Don't waste your time with this piece of garbage.

348,DeltaNu,Great!,10,13 May 2006,"A movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen with music composed by Klaus Badelt can be nothing else but brilliant. And 'Poseideon' definitely proves me right. At first I thought it might be a cheaper version of 'Titanic', but besides from the fact that both movies are about a ship-catastrophe, they couldn't have less in common. Usually those kinds of movies are far too long and get boring after some time. This one is only 1 hour 38 minutes, but they are filled with tension. The main characters are introduced shortly, then the waves comes and the tragedy begins... within the first 10 to 15 minutes! I liked Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell together. Their characters weren't especially complex, but they did manage to make them believable. The fact that Kurt Russell's character dies at the end makes the whole story more real and less Hollywood - it's not fair who lives and dies in real life either (I hope the people who were involved with 'War of the Worlds' read this). The characters may be a little stereotyped... Everybody who watches it can somehow identify with one of them. There's the homosexual, the young heroic guy, the mother and her little boy, the overprotective father with his grown-up daughter, the brat, etc. Those could have been a little more complex, I admit it. The story, though, is very interesting, full of tension, love, shocking scenes, desperation, heroism and tragedy. The viewer feels connected to the characters, one knows about their lives and some personal things, so seeing them die (partly) makes one aware of the great catastrophe.",Poseidon

Are you seeing a pattern? This movie is the most stupid movie in a long time, I found my self laughing at most parts. After the boat flips (even a tad bit before), so do your expectations of watching a not only entertaining film but a GOOD film. So do yourself (and your brain) a favor and watch the original. The plot holes are as big as the stupid boat and the parts where it trys to make you cry...you laugh...it is just an obstacle course, with rules of a pathetic horror movie...if you are mean=you die, if you are scared (or Mexican)=you die, if you are too nice=you die if you are self sacrificing=you die. So basically this film is predictable in the process of the few (stupid) survivors being picked off one by one. The film looks like it was written by a ten year old. Now please rent the original, the self sarcificing character is way funnier. Another point is when it trys to make you laugh you cringe...and it does that a lot.",Poseidon
350,parker1177,this film simply didn't cut it as a full-blown summer action thriller,5,12 May 2006,"This film is kinda like the last hour of TITANIC stretched out into 90 minutes and without any of the cheesy romance stuff. Interest you? It sorta interested me, but once it was all said and done (and done quickly, I might add), there wasn't much to remember and I have to say that this film actually disappointed me somewhat, particularly because we as movie audience deserve and expect a lot more than what this film ultimately offered. Other than its impressive BIG WAVE scene and corresponding tumble of the big boat in the water, things ultimately fell into a groove, with a tiny portion of the people from the ship, hooking up and attempting to make their way out of there. After a while though, they're basically just moving from one room to the next room to the next room, etc It's a little suspenseful, but also not all that gripping, since it's an ""action movie"" after all, and the characters aren't all that developed. I did care about Kurt Russell and his daughter though, but that might've simply been the ""Snake Plissken factor"" coming into play. Everyone else did their jobs okay, but the film simply didn't bowl me over in any which way or form, and I gotta sayany future moviemaker that attempts to do a ""boat sinking flick"" better make sure that they are aiming higher than the TITANIC because that film impressed us back in 1997, and if you can't beat that todayyou're in trouble.This high-budgeted movie even had some obvious CGI characters being tossed around in the water at times, and that just takes you out of the movie. Sure, I was as happy to see the chick from the Black Eyed Peas in the film, but other than that, I was simply lightly entertained by it all, noticing weird things in the movie, just to keep things interesting like a ""statuette"" sitting next to Emmy Rossum's character in the first shot of her and her boyfriend in the film, and a possible pass from Josh Lucas onto a fellow Latina passenger as they were crawling through an air-duct at some point I don't knowmaybe I was just day-dreaming, not sure. At about 90 minutes in length, I would certainly not recommend you spend your hard-earned money on this obvious video flick.

These characters were hardly explored and little was given into having anyone empathise with any of them. Charlton Heston got you fired up by asking for a cup of water, Kurt Russel played hero, protective father and failed mayor and i truly felt it could have been done by anyone.Josh Lucas did try and save the movie as the rebel hero figure, but he failed to get it afloat.

It kept losing its focus and it kinda frustrated me. The acting pretty much sucked and the cast was just dead. It's boring. The only part I like is when Poseidon messed up the ship and pretty much killed everybody. I like action and this movie doesn't have it. I'd rather watch Titanic.

The critics, including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, have said that the story and characters were not developed enough and the main characters were all too good. Well I have to say this. The story and the characters were developed enough and it didn't have to have any human antagonists because the messed up ship is a big enough antagonist for the whole movie. The biggest heroes in the film are Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell) and Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas).

However, I must say the action was really hot from point A to Z, the first ten minutes of the film I didn't give time to reflect over what happened, but from there on and after I was hooked to the screen and didn't loose touch for a second. Interesting and well make. The women were the best actors general speaking, according to me :)",Poseidon

On return this year to view Poseidon my opinions were only strengthened.Poseidon is a stinker. The film has no heart at all and absolutely no character development. Due to the rush that is this films editing, the director uses the most in-opportune moments to stuff in some emotional depth. Take for instance a scene where the characters are in certain peril. Snake, sorry, Kurt Russell, ex fireman and mayor of New York (but of course) decides to have an emotional 'heart-to-heart' conversation with his daughter about boys, a scene akin to that of chatting a girl up at a funeral.Nothing saves this dreary film, the special effects are rank, the acting, apart from Drefuss and Russell, both on auto pilot, is dire and Russell's death is comical.

It's one of those movies that you settle in with your popcorn and soda and let go of the concerns of the world. Yes, there were more cheesy scenes than all of Wisconsin, but c'mon, look at the ""entertainment"" on television.Like relationships, movies work best with low expectations, and high acceptance, then everything tends to be a pleasant surprise. It helps to understand going into the theater, that it's not ""Gone With The Wind"". It was a great distraction and thrilling adventure, when I wanted to ""escape"" for a few hours.

We meet Dylan who is running around the decks of the ship. He meets Elena & tells her where to find her quarters. WOW! We then meet Robert who walks in on his daughter making time with her boyfriend Christian. He gives her this big speech about not feeling comfortable about their relationship. Christian stands there with his thumb up his ass. Anywho. We skip all the way to New Years Eve in the dining hall. Dylan is gambling against Lucky Larry, & Robert. They are throwing down high stakes trying to show who is the bigger moron. ""You are with me so far right"" We now meet Richard who is buying all his pals expensive wine. Then he tells them he lied to them. Lied? About what? We never find out. Anywho The bridge crew has all this great technology; I mean state of the art. They are watching the monitors & nothing. Clear weather for miles All of the sudden they see through a pair of binoculars a great tidal wave. They try to turn the ship only to get hit. Unreal Anywho, the ship starts turning over, people start falling everywhere, They fell in the kitchen, the disco, the dining hall, my ass, you name it. Well. The captain tells everyone that a rogue wave hit the ship. He also states that this is normal but can be deadly. Is he f**king kidding I think Captain Stubing would have come up with a better excuse than that. What a DUMB ASS! Anywho Let's wrap this up Our heroes (losers) start to climb there way to the bottom of the ship. Mainly cause the gambler, Dylan knows they there is a escape hatch in the propeller How does he know this? He's a gambler. It's common knowledge for graduates of GA (Gamblers Anonymous). They make their way with justifiable sacrificial deaths according to Dylan, but hey, he saves the kid AWE!!!!They make their way out only to find a life raft just waiting there for them to use equipped with a flair gun Dylan fires the flair & within seconds, The Coast guard arrived to save the day The end.

The only block this film busted was my wallet for paying to see this piece of sh*t I remember the original & I thought it was on the corny side but it was entertaining. The actors build the characters to the point that you really did care about them. Even to the point of Shelly Winters diving in the water to save the preacher only to die of a heart attack. It was human & believable. The characters looked real as well as the special effects. Every aspect that made the Poseidon Adventure a great film. This film lacked all those traits. The characters were unlikable or you just didn't care. The ship looked so plastic as well as the characters. The heroics of Dylan were just so stupid that you would wish the character an unpleasant but slow death. Yes Folks, I HATE Dylan!!! Trust me, before the film is over you will tooAnywho.

365,valeripaxtonsteele,Just OK,4,25 September 2017,"I have heard people criticizing the dialogue, primarily, but I don't think that is the problem. The actors were fine, the CGI good (not remarkable) and even the dialogue was not terrible. I think it was the lack of character development. There is no one you are really rooting for. There is no dramatic tension, like in the original between Rogo and the preacher. There is no great love, like Manny's and Belle's. No super-smart munchkin to put in his two cents. The timid one in the remake is just not believable, whereas you could tremble along with Nonnie. The characters are two dimensional, and there is nothing to pull you in, to make you care. I know the original has an extra 20 minutes over this remake. I wonder if that extra 20 minutes would have made a difference here?

369,TimeaSiesta,Great visual impact but a sub-par story line,4,25 June 2006,"My likes: The opening deck-running scene was exceptionally creative and captivating and set the stage for an enjoyable movie experience. Stacy Ferguson was wonderful in her singing role. The rest of the cast was well-selected and performed admirably. The elaborate sets and special effects were both stunning and completely credible. My dislikes: I would have preferred to see substantially more character development. I expected and therefore felt slightly cheated that there wasn't more of an in-depth focus into the individual backgrounds and personalities of the passengers, the captain and the crew members around whom the story unfolded. What histories and hopes did each bring to this sailing? The rather abrupt ending was somewhat of a frustration as well; that general sense of disappointment was almost palpable in the theater where I saw it.",Poseidon
370,AlexWard,"Good movie, jaded audience!",9,4 June 2006,"OK, here's the problem. Recently, Hollywoods offerings have pretty much fit into one of two categories. Absurdly expensive special effects blockbuster with timid, undeveloped plot, or fairly low budget, decent story. Audiences have come to expect one or the other and thus lump Poseidon into the first one. However, that's not the type of film Poseidon is. X3, for example, was light on character development. Given the first two films, fleshed out, human characters are what we expect. But, Poseidon is the type of film that's all about ""Whoa! That was close!"" or ""Aw man, she died"". It doesn't matter who the characters are, the movie is all about the suspense and excitement of their escape from a watery grave. To make a comparison, what did we know about Grant, Ellie, Lex and Tim at the end of Jurassic Park? Almost nothing! And yet, the film is rated 7.5 stars on IMDb while Poseidon has 5.6. What's the difference? Both movies are full of cgi effects and about getting out of a very dangerous situation. The ride is what matters here, not the characters. The action and the escape ARE the plot. Would it make any difference if we know someone's whole back story or not when they are swimming through a flooded tunnel with no idea if it lets out into air or not? No, of course not. The thrill is in the suspense of whether or not they will make it! Yes, the characters are fairly generic, but that doesn't matter! See Poseidon without comparing it to the novel or the first movie, put yourself in the passengers place without worrying about who the really are or where they come from, and you will see it for what it is, a suspenseful exciting, edge of your seat film!",Poseidon

I have never seen the original so I can't compare but from this standards the 2006 version is one to watch. It's not the greatest film this year but it's in my top 5.

373,kmcnab,Unintentially cheesy,4,19 May 2006,"This kind of film will always be reliant on effects, and in the case of a big ship that encounters some problems, Poseidon is always going to be compared to Titanic. But Peterson enjoys messing around with water, so it's OK to be optimistic.It starts out in a similar vein to the Big T, with a nice sweeping view of the star of the show. The main characters are clumsily introduced to us within the first ten minutes - and the ones who are evidently not going to make it may as well have giant bulls-eyes tattooed on their foreheads. Peterson makes no effort to give any of these people a credible character. But in his defense, this is not why we're here. We want to see Peterson ""flip the ship"" - which he does rather well. All the big money shots are present and accounted for.Once the ship flips, things take a turn for the frankly ludicrous - and there is a part of me that says ""Why Not?"". Its a remake of a big cheesy 70s disaster movie. It's not aiming for realism.The motley crew of escapees start their attempt to escape. Things are occasionally a bit tense, and often hilarious (not intentionally), the escapees start dropping like flies. The dialogue is ridiculous, but there are some big explosions and near misses, that you can put your brain into neutral and just enjoy the ride.It's a silly, but perfectly acceptable way to spend a few hours - and worth seeing on the big screen to fully appreciate the scale of the movie. But Wolfgang shouldn't expect any calls from the academy...",Poseidon

Don't reward this with your curiosity, let alone your attention",3,10 June 2006,"If you ever want to watch a movie that sums up the very worst of Hollywood, watch Poseidon. Right from the first shot of the film Wolfgang Peterson is merely showing off his CGI budget, and you know that the rest of it is going to stink. And he doesn't disappoint. The script is probably one of the worst ever written - it's clichéd, sexist, and the writer clearly never saw Airplane! Peterson hasn't a clue how to direct actors, or indeed anything else other than his beloved CGI water.The acting is terrible: the only well delivered line is when Richard Dreyfuss is asked, ""Is it bad?"" and he replies with conviction, ""IT'S VERY BAD!"" The audience feels his pain. The film is littered with post 9/11 overtones, such as the boat being overturned by a ""rogue"" wave (what the hell is that?!) and Christian iconography is apparently useful to get you out of trouble - God is referenced to every other line. I think this was written by and for the paranoid bible belt.And I hate the fact that they still assume that in disaster scenarios people will react by running around with their arms in the air, screaming and attacking each other. Look at 9/11, look at the London bombings - these things DON'T HAPPEN.",Poseidon

Unfortunately, it was as bad as I expected it to be... and then some.What truly makes this film a bottom-of-the-barrel disaster movie is that underneath the horribly cheesy lines, bad performances from decent actors, brutally obvious plot holes, inconsistent characters, and excessive contradictions, I cannot think of one positive thing to say about this movie. You will hear some good things about the special effects, but I definitely didn't see any ahead-of-its-time or state-of-the-art stuff. Decent, yes, but for a film with a budget like this one, they should have done better even there. This film will forever blemish the careers of talented young actors Josh Lucas and Emmy Rossum.

376,TorquemadaFan,Brilliant agenda. Good effects. Great entertainment!,8,26 February 2007,"Of all the simplification going on today in movies - big effects, stupid stories - it is rare to find a film with top notch effects and a good story. This is one of those films, but it was greatly misunderstood upon release. People cried it was even more psychologically shallow than the original from 1972 which was itself much more shallow than the source novel. But that is not the point, the film is DEEP. No Pun Intended. Deep not on a psychological level, but on the brilliantly subtle and honest agenda.The film shows the value of the nuclear family and the greatness of the Caucasoid race.FIRST: the wave scene. The black captain is irresponsibly away from his command post and a white officer senses trouble and spots the wave.SECOND: the elevator shaft. All the white people go across and the hispanic guy is left dangling. He served his purpose to aide the white people and now due to a do or die situation is is RIGHTFULLY and REMORSELESSLY dropped. The Gay White man cries a little about it, but that is because he is weak. The Hero - Dylan Johns, a heterosexual white male - just treats the whole situation is business is business. Strong man.THIRD: crossing the lobby. The drunken, irresponsible swindling gambler hispanic gets crushed because he endangers the white people from crossing the lobby. Then the strong white heterosexual hero find a way to get white father and daughter across, this preserving the white nuclear family.FOURTH: ballroom breach. The weak black captain with no leadership skills or initiative gets all his passengers drowned by staying in the ballroom like a scared hapless coward.FIFTH: vent crawling. The white hero gets rallies everyone, but especially the coward stowaway hispanic woman to go through the vent. Then the strong white father and the young white boy (who will grow to be a hero) open the vent with their faith in the Lord. No keys necessary, just a cross and faith. That is how they did it.SIXTH: swimming through flooded hallways. The stowaway hispanic woman gets punished for her lies by drowning. She wanted to get on the ship and she got just what she wanted all the while Justice was served as well.SEVENTH: saving Connor. He is trapped, inexplicably, but the strong white hero saves him and reunited him with his mother. This sets up their future as a true and righteous nuclear family.EIGHTH: dealing with propellers. This is an unrealistic scene as the propellers wouldn't bet running since the system controlling them is smashed and flooded, but this little lie tells a great truth in the story: the nuclear family is most important. The white young man bravely offers to help save father and daughter, but the righteous father knows: he must save them so they can have a family. He dies for them and the strong white hero and his soon to be nuclear family.NINTH: on the surface and rescue. The two nuclear families are safe, but the gay man is alone. he survived because he is white and still has a chance to turn to the righteous side. His lover didn't respond to him on the phone earlier and that was his sign to abandon his sinful ways and start a nuclear family. It is left for the audience to decide whether he'll do this, but the most important thing shave been said so it is good to leave it like that.Brilliant agenda. Good effects.

377,SSRhodes,Great action film,8,20 March 2007,"This is a wonderful action film. Contrary to what previous 'reviewers' have written about it, it's very well crafted, exciting, and definitely worth a look. The underwater sequences were breathtaking and 'sit on the edge of your seat' intense. The performances were all good - in particular Emmy Rossum and Richard Dreyfuss. Both actors brought realism, humanity, and a wonderful sense of fragility to their roles. (Side note - perhaps the reason that many people laughed at Dreyfuss' character during a screening mentioned in an earlier review is because of their ignorance and homophobia; after all, the character couldn't really be feeling pain at the loss of a love because he's gay. If you didn't catch that, yes ... it's sarcasm.) Comparing this version of the film with the original 1972 film is like comparing apples and oranges. They are two different completely different films. Where this one excels (special effects, cinematography), the 1972 film was mediocre at best; considering the technology available at that time in the film industry, this isn't much of a surprise. Where the 1972 film excels (script and overall performances), this one is just so-so.

380,buystuff-1,Characters? What characters?,4,15 May 2006,"""Poseidon"" struck me as rough draft of a script someone snatched and spent $160 million in special effects on. We get maybe five-ten minutes of setup, then the disaster starts with someone on the bridge going ""Can you feel that? Something's wrong!"" Who was that guy? A super professional sailor who knew the sea, or just the most convenient way to show the ominous and impeding Rogue Wave of Doom? Next we have a captain in the upturned lounge who somehow knows they were hit by a rogue wave even though the ship's alarms went off right before it capsized. There was a very tiny bit of explanation behind all the characters, enough to feel like there's something more, then nothing. Josh Lucas seems very intent to escape and knows an awful lot about the ship and how it operates, but that's never developed.Kurt Russell is the former mayor of New York and a an ex-firefighter for, well, nothing. The firefighting comes in handy, but why make him anything other than a generic rich guy? Richard Dreyfus is a gay man hoping for a phone call from his ex-lover, which means---anything? Lastly, Kevin Dillon for some reason doesn't like the ex-mayor, but before he gets to that he's crushed by a falling generator.As other reviewers have noted, there's not a single other survivor they run into, and the movie breaks down into a series of obstacles and death-defying underwater swims that would put a pearl diver to shame. Some of the predicaments would be more emotional if you knew or even cared anything about the characters.In the end, do what most people do with these re-makes (or ""re-imaginings"" as they usually toss everything out) and go out and watch the original. The special effects aren't as good, but they have better plots, more humor, actual drama, real characters, and remind you of a time before Hollywood became a sequel spewing machine that only counted the numbers.",Poseidon

I might as well have used nine dollars as toilet paper, because I can't recall seeing a more crappy movie in my life. First of all, there is absolutely no character development what so ever. You don't get to know the characters or what they are like. And with no character development, I could basically have cared less about what happened to them. Secondly, no explanation what so ever about how a tidal wave suddenly appeared in the middle of the ocean. Thirdly, Completely unrealistic scenarios. A little boy being able to unscrew a bolt on the other side of an air vent with a cross of a necklace, Kurt Russel after he had drowned was some how magically able to press the button to reverse the engines.

382,dbwiii,Poseidon exciting but all wet,5,10 September 2006,"It is evident from very early on in the film that the script writing team opted for action over substance. As a strict disaster/thriller/action film, Poseidon is definitely capable of getting the adrenaline of the audience going. Admittedly, there are few dull moments. That said, there is so much more that could have been possible. Character development is minimal thereby condemning a fairly decent cast to being nothing more than two dimensional stick figures. The few subplots behind the main characters are superficial and meaningless at best. Much of the budget has obviously been spent on the massive sets and special effects.

The movie then plunges immediately into action with minimal back story on the main characters. This makes empathy for the characters real difficult. Corny dialogue. One can also figure out quite quickly which of the characters get to die first. It's a guy with a non-Caucasian surname.The special effects weren't that special. It did bring back the horrible images from the tsunami.The ""suspense-filled"" scenes weren't exciting. You just know they were going to make it.

I won't give away the ending, but it was much more satisfying than the original. Richard Dreyfuss' performance stays with you more than you would imaging it would.

Why wasn't there any defined character? Why wasn't there much more than two large rooms (which even looked nearly the same), some narrow passages and a lot of water? Or in short: Why wasn't there any script?OK, the effects were actually OK and there was at least a bit of suspense, but that is just too less for a $140 million production. The actors were as wooden as many of the furniture, only Josh Lucas could satisfy a bit. I have absolutely no idea why Petersen didn't at least try to give them something like identity. I don't want to loose to much words, the movie isn't just worth that. Only one thing: If you are interested in something like a story or at least one or two nice characters avoid this movie.

One of these outings was to an IMAX screen, and it was well worth the trip.If you're a purist who loved the '72 version, but whose universe is threatened by a remake, then you're guaranteed to hate this film... don't bother seeing it, because no one wants to hear you whine about it - but that's your loss.Going in with an open mind, this is what I found (and I HATED the TV remake last fall): As a movie, it's very well done. The cast is fantastic, the writing is good and well adapted to the circumstances the characters find themselves in. The special effects are out of this world. It is also brilliantly directed; the tension is downright stomach-churning the first time you see it. In fact, if you have a real fear of heights, drowning, fire or claustrophobia, think twice before seeing the film.Everything that was not explained in the first film (like, for example, what on earth was causing those numerous underwater explosions?) is explained in this, and you actually get to see how the sinking is progressing, and how the characters are affecting the ship as they go. It's also a far more realistic depiction of the amount of time that the ship would stay afloat after capsizing than the original film and its (hideous) sequel.Additionally, the depiction of the rogue wave striking the POSEIDON is not only visually stunning, but scientifically accurate to what we now know about rogue waves. The director actually re-created a known rogue wave for this film. Other cruise ships in recent years have been struck by these waves (head on, not broadside) and have only managed to survive with significant damage.One of these days, in the not-too-distant future, a big cruise ship will get hit with a rogue wave and capsize... what will it be like? Go see the movie for an idea.",Poseidon
389,blogzillla,A wet mess of a remake,3,10 June 2014,"I suppose the producers and casting agents thought $120million, big names like Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss would save the day with this stinker - but there wasn't a chance in hell any of that could have saved this wet mess. The people that produced and directed it must have been on coke and bourbonThere are several obvious mistakes 1. If they were supposed to be sailing in the North Atlantic, it is well know that water that cold will put you in shock and hypothermia in minutes.2. In one scene we see the ship totally capsized but still floating, then when it finally starts to sink, it is seen in an upright position. Hmm, really? What were the people that made this movie thinking?The acting is mediocre at best and cheesy. Strangely enough I could barely tell the difference between either one of the female characters with the exception of Emmy Rossum. Mike Vogel might as well have been a hologram or robot his presence was so insignificant and banal. It didn't help any that he was given some of the most corny and whiny lines. Another problem - unlike the 1972 original, you never get attached to any of the main characters with this terrible remake. The only thing great about this movie perhaps is the special effects. It's the kind of movie you'll want to play at a house party New Year's beer bust so all your friends can get a good laugh, otherwise I don't see what the point is, because it's pretty awful.",Poseidon
390,yodempsey,One Big Yawn,4,10 October 2020,"Kurt Russell had long been one of my favorite actors, but he can't save this movie from sinking into the depths of oblivion. You'd have a far, FAR more enjoyable experience watching the original Allen Irwin version. This version is devoid of any soul. There is almost zero character development, so you likely won't even care who dies (except perhaps Russell). The original movie was totally rich in character development and you definitely cared when anyone died. Not so in this version. Even the special effects are unimpressive. Don't waste your time. It is totally forgettable.",Poseidon
391,communistgodzilla,Beyond 'The Poseidon Adventure',6,27 August 2006,"Since Hollywood loves remakes, it seemed inevitable that the campy (yet enduring) '70s classic 'The Poseidon Adventure' would get a big budget do-over. While 'Poseidon' (the remake) has its moments, it doesn't really measure up to the original movie.The plots of both movies (based on a novel by Paul Gallico) are similar: just after New Year's Eve, a gigantic wave slams into the luxury liner ""Poseidon,"" and capsizes it. With their world literally turned upside-down, a group of survivors try to reach the surface before the ship sinks. Only now the ship is a slowly-sinking deathtrap, with catastrophe lurking around every corner. Who will survive? Who will die? Which unlucky character will sacrifice themselves so that others may live? 'The Poseidon Adventure' is well-known for its colorful cast of strong actors, who created memorable characters that audiences cared about. 'Poseidon' has some good actors (Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Jacinda Barrett, Andre Braugher) in its cast, but they have little to do here except look scared: they have one or two traits mentioned in passing, and that's it. You'll be hard-pressed to even remember some of their names once the credits start rolling. With so little characterization, it's hard to empathize with the plight these people face; the audience may as well be watching attractive stunt people going through their paces (to the movie's credit though, it looks like the actors did most of their own stunts).And make no mistake, 'Poseidon' is positively plight-filled: once the wave strikes the ship at around the 15-minute mark, it's pretty much non-stop action right to the end, as our protagonists dodge explosions, survive floods, swing across fiery chasms, swim long distances through flooded passageways filled with debris, and more. 'Poseidon' certainly isn't a boring movie, and director Wolfgang Petersen does give us some good scenes here and there, most notably one in a rapidly-flooding ventilation shaft. But once again, with such cardboard characters, it's hard to get really involved with this movie, and some of the inane situations and plot holes don't help matters either: for example, how does the kid manage to get himself stuck in a dog carrier? Why are the propellers of the ship still spinning full-blast at the end of the movie? How do some of the characters know the layout of a ship they've never been on before? The movie doesn't take the time to explain any of this, which will leave you scratching your head at best, or laughing when you shouldn't be at worst.'Poseidon' isn't a totally bad movie: there's lots of action, stunts and well-done special effects sequences for fans of that sort of thing, and a few scenes manage to be gripping, even if only briefly. And with a lean running time of 97 minutes, 'Poseidon' wastes no time making its point. But the weak script, dumb dialog, and paper-thin characters ultimately sink the film. Action fans and fans of 'The Poseidon Adventure' may want to check this out for curiosity's sake. Just don't be surprised if you can't remember anything about the movie once it ends.",Poseidon

Boat looked so fake and so did the ""tidal"" wave, not to mention a bunch of other ""special effects"" were so obviously nothing more than computer generated. As to storyline... er, where was the liner heading? What caused freak wave? Would have been more convincing with them sailing into major storm. How far from land were they and where did the helicopters magically come from? I honestly think the original version was better and that's saying something.

When is Hollywood gonna realize that you shouldn't remake a classic and CGI special effects aren't enough to carry a film you need a Good script to go with it.

The effects are amazing and the acting was impressive despite the fact that the actors didn't have much to work with as far as back stories. The characters backgrounds were briefly mentioned during the movie but probably went unnoticed by most people. They were great starting ideas for interesting but not yet completed characters. For example, Dylan was a great character but without knowing his back story we have no idea why he acted the way he did. Despite lacking some things, one thing that wasn't lacking was the feeling of excitement you get from watching this movie.

Surprisingly, I did not get that, but a bundle of laughs in this fun adventureous comedy that i recommend to anyone. The improbable things come up just as many times as bad and witty dialogue. If you are having a bad day or simply want to smile, go see this feel good comedy of the year, Poseidon!Some people do meet bitter and gruesome ends in Poseidon, but don't let that stray you from seeing this movie.

399,kcarman,Tough Movie to Rate,5,12 May 2006,"First, it is a remake...so it has that going against it.Next, even the positive comments admit no character development or plot to speak of.Next, the special effects were OK, but fireballs and water has been done once or twice before...nothing out of the ordinary.Next, the lines were terrible.Yet, the movie was OK when compared to something like Flightplan! Biggest miss: I'm fairly astute observer but they didn't drive home the point that the kitchen help was the friend of the hitchhiker. Goes to show you how poorly the characters were developed.Biggest confusion: Dreyfus character wanted to die. Then he sends a man to his death. Then the movie appeared to kill him two or three more times. And I'm not even sure why.Biggest laugh: How soccer moms, retired mayors, sit on butt poker players and little children could hold their breath equally as well. In a lot of water movies I have caught myself holding my breath...not once in this one.Biggest reaction: When Russell bites the dust...his convulsions kind of sent a chill down my spine.Biggest surprise: The character Dillon, first name, was actually a pleasant surprise...OK, until he was sucked up the tube, released a 50 pound ""bomb"" that set of an explosion enough to break-up a propeller the size of a bus...and then lived! But not bad.Biggest disappointment: After seeing Crash and enjoying some of Matt Dillon's other efforts...well, let's just say that Bill Murray's lounge act is safe.If we save 1 and 2 ratings for Battleship Earth, 3 and 4 for major flaws like Flightplan, then you have to give this movie the 5.

400,chubbiecubbie07,Is Posiedon as good as the original? Check my review.,7,27 May 2006,"Category- Thriller Poseidon is a suspenseful movie starring Kurt Russell. (You may know him from Sky High or Miracle) During their cruise they are struck with a rare freakish tidal wave that plows the boat over upside-down. From there a group of 5 tries to get to the top of the ship where they can swim out the propeller tubes and out to open water.This movie was a very suspenseful movie with some questionable acting. This movie, however, was a tough movie to win an Oscar for. The main actors and actresses had to go through long periods under water in one breath. Fergie, though, is still not cut out for acting. Shawn Edwards from FOX says this is, ""A Terror Drenched Thrill Ride Full of Action and Suspense."" Overall I would give Poseidon a 3.5/5.

401,grandslam40,Poseidon is a Great Movie,9,4 October 2008,"I just watched Poseidon for the second time on TV last night, after watching it on DVD a couple years ago. I remember really enjoying this movie, and watching it again it just got better. I have never seen the original ""Poseidon Adventure,"" which means I have nothing to compare this movie to.The acting in this movie is very strong. Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, and Richard Dreyfuss (the shark guy from Jaws) were all very believable and sincere and the character development, while a little hurried, is very real and convincing. All of the main characters were important and relevant and contributed to the story. Josh Lucas' character was my personal favorite and his development is fantastic. At the beginning of the movie he was a cunning and self-centered loner, then grows to be brave and a good leader. The small group that decides to leave the ballroom where the survivors of the initial wave strike stay becomes very close and captivating to the audience.Another positive in this movie is the enchanting special affects. There is no way any critic could knock on the sheer brilliance of the created wave, or the way the filmmakers show the cruise ship tragically capsize and flip over. It was all very impressive.Critics of this film (and there must be a lot of them, considering the 5.6 rating on IMDb) have constantly found faults in the predictability and convenience of the story. And if you look for it, yeah, you might find that there is a fire hose right near the flooded area that is just long enough to make it across the balconies, among a few *just in time* moments. However if you watch this with an open mind, and sense of adventure it shouldn't bother you at all. I personally don't mind if there are small, ""lucky"", things that help the characters...especially when I am engrossed in the story.Poseidon is a great adventure and a good movie to rent on DVD, now that it is out of theaters. If you ignore the nasty comments made on this website about this movie and give it a watch, I think most people would enjoy it. Again, if you are watching this for fun, and to see an action-packed, thrilling, adventure and not to criticize, Poseidon will not disappoint.AWESOME MOVIE!!",Poseidon
402,Brothepro,Should be 0/10,1,15 July 2007,"Raspberry award winner. These were the only three words that came to my mind after watching the atrocity called Poseidon. If you thought Deep Impact was a load of rubbish in the disaster movie category then this tops the worst 100 disaster movie lists of all time like a glacé cherry on a cake. An extremely rotten cherry on a year old soggy cake.There are two positives to this film. The graphics were pretty spectacular but can be a little bit fake here and there especially at the beginning where the water did not seem to be moving. Secondly, most of the characters died, which I hate to say but it is a relief when characters who annoy you to death just die. Okay, maybe the part of the annoying characters is a negative.However there are loads of negatives and by the shipload. Firstly there are so many clichés like Kurt Russell was a fireman and the former mayor of New York City. And there was a kid who is a high school champion at swimming. Then there is the typical drunk scruffy looking guy. Plus there is an architect. And a rebel played by Josh Lucas who also knows a lot about ships. And there is the kid that always get trapped and the whiny mother who cries whenever there is a small accident. Who form a relationship with Josh Lucas' character. Told you it was clichéd and blissfully coincidental.Then you get scenes where the characters try to be emotional. For example Emmy Rossum needs to say ""I love you"" to this kid who she is forming a relationship with. It is so predictable like when Josh Lucas says he found a way out then out comes water or the annoying little kid who gets trapped then the unexplainable happens but Josh Lucas saves the day again.It feels like Wolfgang Petersen gave up on the first minute of this film thinking a ton of miniature disasters that seem unrealistic and some graphics makes a film. Or maybe he finally got fed up not winning anything in the film industry he was pushing for a Golden Raspberry award and for people who do not know what they are, they are basically celebrating how bad films really can be. 0/10.",Poseidon
403,exntrc1,Disappointed With This Nonsense,4,22 September 2006,"All I wanted from this film was 90 minutes of mindless entertainment (I had no illusions about its grandeur) but it was so lame that I'm mad I wasted any time on it at all. Three points are for special effects and one is for Josh ""Tasty Treat"" Lucas.First, Kurt Russell plays some tight ass dad who gets all bent out of shape because his daughter has one button of her blouse undone. PLEASE! This is Jack Burton, Snake Plisskin, Sergeant Todd, Gabe Cash - even the The Computer (who) Wore Tennis Shoes - not some repressed psycho-dad.Richard Dreyfus was totally irrelevant as the movie's token gay. I guessed he was gay because he was wearing a big honking diamond earring in one ear and a bow-tie. My hunch was proved true when he morphed into a sad and pathetic old man who kept calling his young ex-loverman on the phone begging him to call back. He also did some fey thing at the dinner table but I can't remember exactly what it was  this was right before he was going to dramatically throw himself into the sea over his lost love.As we are introduced to other characters I realize that everyone so far is white and this only changes when we are taken to the kitchen  down here we seem to have a lively mix of minorities.Even more lamely, everything starts to happen at midnight on New Years Eve.The bridge is staffed with an all white male crew while the black captain, the excellent Andre Braugher, is ringing in the New Year in the dining room with the white guests. Not much diversity here. One officer on duty mysteriously senses that something is ""not right"" while the captain sits oblivious to everything except the singer Fergie. Then lo and behold through the binoculars  it's a gigantic rogue wave! ** Lots of big special effects. ** A few ship toss survivors decide to hot foot it out of the upside down dining room and a nice waiter, the super duper Freddy Rodriguez, volunteers to help them find their way out. He is so generous in fact that he insists Dreyfus pass over an elevator shaft on a makeshift bridge first. When it's time for Freddy to cross there are of course problems and he ends up hanging from Dreyfus' ankle in the elevator shaft. What follows is a very unpleasant scene. The elevator is shaking loose and will be falling back down/up the shaft to squish everyone and oh no  they're unable to pull the combined Dreyfus and Freddie up to safety! ""Shake him off! Shake him off!"" Josh tells Dreyfus, but Freddy will not be shaken off... so Dreyfus kicks him off and poor, helpful Freddy falls screaming to his death.During this nonsense Russell's film daughter is trapped in the disco (is it 1978 again?!?) where her manly fiancé is stuck under a huge metal lighting stand. Being the delicate creature that she is, she's unable to budge that prodigious foe alone. Oh, look! It's Mía Maestro, the Hispanic waiter's girl friend! She can help with this difficult manual labor task! Also, send her over to pick through the dead bodies to find something sturdy to use as a lever. Miss Priss will stay here by her man in need. I miss the adventurous Shelley Winters.** Lots more crap and a funny Kevin ""Lucky Larry"" Dillon moment. **The only good thing about this movie?

Any of the underwater scenes had good set designing. The actors are very physical because they have no emotional qualities to make me root for their survival. Lucas' character is the overtly implausible superhero who just will not die even when you wish he would. Everyone is one dimensional and the women are so flattened as to be nonexistent. The script should have included more people struggling to survive so a few could be killed off as expected. Some of the special effects are very good, others are nearly cartoons. The opening sequence lacked shading and I thought it was an animated advertisement for the upcoming film. Russell and Dreyfuss were sorely underutilized, Lucas too much.

405,guywhowatchesmovies,"Mike's Recaps: ""Poseidon (2006)""",3,1 August 2009,"A remake of an old movie which wasn't really all that great to begin with, ""Poseidon"" is a not-so-epic drama about a bunch of uninteresting idiots who find themselves stranded on the cruise ship from Hell, after it's struck by a rogue wave at exactly midnight on New Year's Eve, and is literally flipped upside-down. About half the guests die in this unnecessarily graphic scene, and then the remaining half are told by the captain that they should ""stay in the auditorium because it has created an air pocket"" and ""help will arrive in a couple of hours"". Well a few of the guests decide that the captain doesn't know what he's talking about, and, at the advice of an embarrassed-looking Richard Dreyfuss (who is able to use his occupational knowledge as an ""architect"" to deduce that ""ships aren't built to stay afloat upside-down""), venture out into the bowels of the slowly sinking ship in an attempt to find ""another way out"".This intelligent thriller also stars Kurt Russell as a man who looks and acts just like Kurt Russell; Josh Lucas as the stereotypical action hero who seems mysteriously unable to die, despite pulling off multiple stunts which would have put Evel Knieval in traction; Some Kid who seems to have a compulsive habit of running off to the most dangerous parts of the ship whensoever he feels like it (is also source for most of Josh Lucas' heroic antics); Emmy Rossum, whose sole purpose in this motion picture is to bitch about everything, and show as much cleavage as possible; Freddy Rodriquez as a staff member who sneaks ""some girl he met at a club"" on board; and Fergie, who delivers a shockingly realistic performance as a singer at the New Year's Party.Alright - in all fairness, the first twenty minutes of this movie (the flipping scene, specifically) were amusing. But after that it gets a bit boring and repetitive, and after about forty-five minutes, you just kinda stop caring about the characters (assuming, of course, you were one of the three audience members who cared about them at all to begin with) and are left wishing it would end already. About five hours later, it does.I do not recommend this movie. If you must, watch the flipping scene on YouTube, and I promise you'll have seen all the good parts.",Poseidon

410,azmoviesnob,You Gotta Know Your Roots,5,12 May 2006,"***Lots of Spoilers & Comparisons to the book and the original movie*** I am a huge fan of the first movie and the novel and I felt compelled to see the remake - even after hearing mostly negative reviews about the movie. I thought in a few ways the remake built upon the original, but it mostly fell way short. I actually felt the disaster sequence in the original when the ship capsizes was better than in the new one. How can that be possible with all the technology? I was especially disappointed in the scene where the ballroom floods and everyone drowns. I think it was like 25 seconds of the movie. It was literally like one fleeting scene. And where was the Christmas tree? How could they do away with the Christmas tree? That scene was so dramatic in the original and in Poseidon it was totally stale.Even more disconcerting was this -In the first movie, our leaders spend time trying to convince people to come with them before you know what hits the fan. In this one, they just sneak out the back door and don't even try to convince anyone to save themselves and come with them. They just leave them to die w/out even offering to help. That's where I had a big problem with the movie. Why wouldn't Kurt Russell's character offer to help - it was completely out of character. They should have played that power struggle up between him and the captain, but they didn't. Instead, there were about three lines of anti-climatic dialogue between them.Speaking of the captain, I will say this - Andre Braugher is outstanding in his role as captain Michael Bradford. He is both haunting and very convincing. Definitely the most memorable character in the movie. It would have liked to see his role expanded to that of the doctor in the original movie. I also must admit, that enjoyed Stacy Ferguson's small role. I thought she was a perfect fit.Overall, I felt the acting was both hit and miss. The trio of Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell and Jacinda Barrett did very well and played admirable roles considering they really didn't have much script to work with.On the flip side, Emmy Rossum, Mike Vogel, and especially Kevin Dillon were horrible - a total joke. Too much cheese. Then we have Richard Dreyfuss - the oddball character. What in the heck was his deal? OK, he is gay architect. I think that is all we learn about the guy. I thought his character was kind of campy and generally kind of funny, but was completely insignficant. And what about his glasses? You'd think maybe he would have lost them after the ship flips up-side-down. No sir...The one major theme that I wish they would have expanded upon is the role of others not in the group also trying to escape. The coolest thing about the book was that a whole bunch of people survive. The reader doesn't find this out until the end, but the group sometimes mixes with random characters throughout their harrowing escape. In the original movie, this is touched upon in the group's run in with the doctor. (Who was also leading a rogue group of escapees out, but choose a different route only to never reappear.) I find it hard to believe that on a boat that big that everyone except for five or six people would die. What about all the employees of the vessel? Peterson showed clips of them before the tragedy so I thought maybe he would focus on that theme, but he didn't. He just killed them all of instantly - so all we have to watch is the same group of people for like 2/3rds of the movie. At least a few people elsewhere on the ship would have survived - at least for a while - and Peterson should have played that theme up and he didn't.Overall, if nothing else - the movie was interesting to compare it to the original. I like how they modernized the ship with the ballroom for the older folks and then the disco floor for the 20 somethings. The glass elevators and deck swimming pool were also nice touches. Kudos to Peterson for showing so many dead people. I didn't even have that big of a problem with the way they completely changed the ending. (Except for the fact that the boat sank very quickly and just seconds after they got off it.) In summary, what the movie lacked was character and certainly grit. Some scenes were just so over-the-top campy and CGI'd to the max that it just didn't feel real. It lacked the passion and heart of the original. I guess I just don't understand why the powers that be veered so far away from a formula that worked so well in the original. Why change the characters? That just doesn't make sense. Why was there no preacher and Lt. Rogo? Those characters worked - why would you take them out? Is it just not PC these days to have a preacher in a movie and have so much religious symbolism as a focal point? Conversely, Peterson goes out of his way in this one to kill all minorities seemingly for no reason at all. Huh? Perplexing...I could write a term paper comparing and contrasting the two movies and the book, but I'll stop here. Mildly entertaining, par for the course these days - I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB MYSELF WITH THE SCRIPT ADAPTATION...5/10.",Poseidon
411,SoapWatch,Effects better~Movie NOT !!,5,20 May 2006,"I was disappointed the first few minutes of the film soon as I saw the ship called ""Poseidon"" instead of the ""SS Poseidon"". Did ships do away with the ""SS"" for some reason? (lol)However, I was amazed by the special effects in this new version when the tidal wave (oh wait, it's been changed to ""Road Wave"" in this version -lol!) actually hits the ship, effects that I wished the original had especially when the ship turns over. But the special effects is about all this new movie had going for it.The original had an all-star cast, which I knew nearly every single one of them. In this one, I knew only a few, none of which give an impressive performance as the original cast did.There were only two cast members I was impressed with and neither one of them are that famous. The young teen who Richard Dreyfuss has to push off his leg in the shaft order to survive. (I take it he was the Roddy McDowall role, only without an accent.) Okay, that scene got to me. I really felt for that character.Also, the boy, Jimmy Bennett played excellent as a ""boy in distress"", even though his role was the exact opposite character wise than the original boy (Eric Shea), who was a fearless cocky genius type kid.I found all of the women in this movie dull and boring---nothing compared to any of the feisty women in the original.Why was Fergie (of the Black Eyed Peas) left behind? In the original, the singer, Carol Lynley goes with them. This left us having a cast of all brunettes and not one single blond. There were so many brunette females, I was getting their characters mixed up.Speaking of the singer, there is no ""Morning After"" song even attempted or recreated to even think of making the top 100 on the BillBoard charts---and this time we had an actual real female singer unlike the original, who was only an actress.Was any of this movie actually thought out? Where were all the creative brains when this movie was made?The industry already knows and is fully aware that just because a movie has spectacular special effects, it is nothing without ""heart"". And I found the new version to be missing exactly that.I also thought I heard mention of the spectacular scene from the original movie where the man falls from the table all the way down into the glass window below then am explosion occurs was going to be recreated in this scene....but the victim's scene was missing.I believe it was that scene that helped the original with it's Oscar Award.I don't look for the new version to get any nominations for any Oscars at all---or any other awards for that matter.The most the movie may get is the kid being nominated for a YAA. Pathetic. (lol)",Poseidon
412,evansj2,Give this film a chance to shine,10,21 October 2006,"This film has such a bad name from so many people, yet I think it is a brilliant film. Some people don't realise how much effort has gone into this film. People say that everything is CGI. Not true. The only things that are CGI in the whole film are: the ship, the wave. That's it. Everything else is sets. People actually were thrown around the place. Water did come in to the ballroom. I think some people don't give this film enough credit. The first time I watched it, I was in awe. It was such a convincing film. The look of the ship and how it interacted with light made it look so real. Sure, some of the film is far-fetched. And sure, you don't get to know the people on board. But that is because of the pace. They can't stand there for half-an-hour, spewing their guts out about themselves when the ship is sinking. The pace of the film is supposed to be rushed. The ship is sinking, and it's not going to stop sinking to let the people stop for a break. So I say give the film a break. If you haven't seen it and are judging it on what your friends/ family have said, ignore them. Watch it for yourself, you may find the film is actually better than what others say. And as said in the title, give this film a chance to shine, it's better than what people say",Poseidon
413,theflyingcow,One of the better remakes,7,12 June 2006,"It's a damn good film! The special effects are superb and some of the scenes (the elevator shaft and the ventilation shaft) rip your nerves to shreds. Furthermore you really have no idea who will live and who will die.One has to compare it to the original and I think a lot of people are looking at the original through rose tinted spectacles. It was good but it was Seventies kitsch with corny dialogue and cheesy characters. This film has them too, but at 98 minutes it leaves little time for artificial character development and takes you straight into the action.Like all action films there are implausible scenes that require you to completely suspend your disbelief. But I have no problems with giant apes climbing tall buildings or lone cops fighting off armies of armed terrorists so I can certainly put up with a group of nobodies defying trying to get out of a capsized ship.One more tip.

Wouldn't it have been great if the filmmakers could have adopted the characters from that one and combined their story with some of these modern effects! Instead we get this group of drab, unpleasant survivors wandering around amazing sets delivering lines of painfully ridiculous dialogue. What a waste. We need to relate to these people before we care what happens to them. Filmmakers, we're not so impatient that we can't pay attention to some actual character development before you overwhelm us with visuals.I'll gladly take Irwin Allen's version over this one.

Even though the movie showed all the females attempting to survive looking identical (squealing and drop dead gorgeous) and the men (square jawed, drop dead gorgeous), and the casualty fodder practically had neons over them (nasty selfish drunkard, waiter, blonde cabaret singer and token black) and lame homophobic overtones and stereotyping such as the gay guy being told to 'keep your back to the wall', plus last but not least 'touching' mother/son will they won't they live scenario, all this and more was to be expected.

421,Randeman2,Some critics are being generous.,4,14 May 2006,"At the point where the First Officer on the bridge inexplicably looked through his binoculars, saw the approaching wave and groaned, ""No!... No!"" I asked myself, ""Is it really any more effort to make a good movie then it is to make a rotten one?"" The answer to this one is a loud, resounding, ""No!...No!"" Frankly, I would be embarrassed to have my name attached to this film and Wolfgan Petersen should be ashamed of himself. ""Poseidon"" opens with long, sweeping shots of a gigantic, modern cruise ship smoothly cutting through the surface of a calm sea. Anyone who has ever been on a passenger ship, or even seen pictures of one, will probably agree that there is nothing especially remarkable about the new ""Poseidon"". When the opening credits conclude, we are introduced to Josh Lucas' character, Dylan, a former US Navy man (convenient), out for an afternoon jog; nothing interesting there. Followed by, in no particular order, Robert(Kurt Russell) a former mayor of New York (and also, conveniently, a former fire fighter); his daughter Jennifer, (Emmy Rossum), and her fiancé, Christian (Mike Vogel); a stowaway, Elena (Mia Maestro); a dining room steward, Marco, (Freddy Rodriguez); a wealthy architect, (who happens to be gay, as kind of an afterthought) Richard, (played by Oscar winner Richard Dreyfuss); a single mother, Maggie and young son Connor, (played by Jacinda Barrett and Jimmy Bennett, respectively); an obnoxious, one-note gambler and ship's drunk, Lucky Larry (Kevin Dillon). None of these people are particularly interesting in any form or fashion. In fact, they are all pretty much totally boring individuals. About fifteen or twenty minutes after we are introduced to these and a few other minor characters, ""Poseidon"" is struck by a rogue wave, and capsized. A great many of the celebrants in the ship's ballroom survive being tossed ass over teakettle when the ship overturns and, once most of them discovered they are pretty much unharmed, begin to search for loved ones, assist with the injured, while others generally scream and wring their hands in fear and despair. One deck below the ballroom, a couple of hundred other passengers in the disco, including Jennifer, Christian, Lucky Larry, and Elena are also picking themselves up off the ceiling. Remarkably, on this vast ocean liner, no one else seems to survive the disaster or it's aftermath. What are the odds? Everyone else (except the few featured players in the disco or the few hundred remaining in the ballroom) are either incinerated by flash fires, crushed by machinery or other falling objects, drown, electrocuted, tossed into the sea, fall from great heights, or, I guess, eaten by sharks. The captain also survives the capsizing. He announces authoritatively that it was decided that ""Poseidon"" was turned turtle by a rogue wave. He informs them that when the wave hit, electronic beacons attached to the ship were released and began transmitting distress signals via satellite. He also tells them that the air bubble that is essentially the ballroom is all that is holding this massive liner afloat. He concludes that help will come and that ""this is not the last moment of your lives."" Many of our principle players feel they know better, (perhaps knowing that the big windows of the ballroom probably can't withstand the pressure of the water outside and will implode pretty much any time) and decide to climb to the bottom of the ship where they will attempt to get out through the ship's bow thrusters. These thrusters are essentially propellers in transverse shafts located in the bow that are used to assist in docking and even turning ""Poseidon."" Reluctantly, Dylan agrees to assist Maggie and Conor out while Richard, who just a few moments before had decided life was no longer worth living and was going to leap from the boat deck in suicidal despair, decides to tag along. Robert joins them in an effort to find his daughter. Finally, steward Marco is brought along as a living map/successor to Roddy McDowall...and the escape begins.Throughout the course of their harrowing adventure, a few of the characters meet their Maker in a variety of ways, one of which is incredibly funny when what appears to be a large air conditioning unit crushes him to death. Sadly, none of these deaths are even remotely touching. This is because we really don't care about them. They are all clichés. We are given no reason to care about these people. We know them only somewhat better than someone we may share a brief elevator ride with every day on our way to work, or sit three rows away from in class. We only know why one of them, the stowaway, is even on the ship, and we are never given in reason empathize or in any way identify with any of the other characters in any significant way. It's as if the only reason these people are around is to react to the disaster and subsequent attempt to climb out of the rapidly sinking vessel. They are fodder for the CGI destruction and the death and injury that they encounter during their escape. The dialog is simplistic and even eyeball roll-inducing. The only thing worth spending the money to see ""Poseidon"" for is, perhaps, the special effects. Although the effects are nothing spectacular, they are somewhat visually dazzling, however brief. There is nothing really remarkable about the sets, costumes, music, production design, direction, or make-up. It's 100 minutes of special effects and their impact on people you don't care about, saying things you have no interest in hearing. I read somewhere that the only reason Richard Dreyfuss was in ""Poseidon"" was because they offered him a boatload of money (no pun intended). An excellent actor, I hope that in the future he will give more consideration to projects than the water-logged clunker now at your local multiplex called ""Poseidon.""",Poseidon
422,abyboom-1,"one billionth ""Das Boot"" + one millionth ""The Perfect Storm""",3,18 May 2006,"...And those are the only good parts of this movie. I have not seen the original(an advantageous position when it comes to remakes, or so I thought!!), and was looking forward to this movie, simply because Wolfgang Peterson and Sea Adventures mix like scotch and water. With Das Boot(one of the greatest movies ever made) and The Perfect Storm (not perfect enough, thanks to the melodrama on the land, but the Sea was once again very impressive.) behind his back, how much can one go wrong? Watch it to believe it.The opening shot was quite auspicious and so were the first five minutes. Nothing great, but good. Just when one is thinking that things might get interesting with the characters, Poseidon gets angry and sends out a ""rougue wave"" to play Topsy turvy the vehicle so fondly named after him. And then the story of getting out from the inverted ship starts. And though this is the main storyline, the ""inverted"" theme rarely features at all after the disaster. It turns out to be just another ""escape from locked building"" movies with lots of water thrown in randomly, to remind the audience that ""we are at sea"". And that's where the movie is going. To the bottom of the sea.And what's the fascination with dead bodies? Every five minutes you open a ""hatch"", and encounter more water or dead bodies and sometimes both. It is just stupid to show that nobody else survived the wave from anywhere else in the ship. An opportunity of parallel storyline washed into the sea. And I am confident that Razzie will open a new category this year for the ""Worst Dialouges"" just to honour (no irony intended) this movie. It really takes some effort to come up with dialouges as banal and crass as in this movie.Needless to say, the characters are monochromatic straight lines. The characters are eager to get off the ship, true. But, looks like the actors playing them were in more hurry of getting this film off their back. And Wolfgang too! With a 140 mill into the water( I am sure he must have realized it early in the shoot, hence the movie was 90 min long) there was really not much choice, but to finish it quickly.There are some good names associated with this movie. I hope they will forget about this sinker and go-ahead with their lives. Certainly, Wolfgang needs to. He is in the chair for Ender's Game. That's one of my favorite stories. I just hope he does not End it in the beginning, like the Poseidon.",Poseidon

424,WritestuffLA,Wolfgang Petersen is The Most Overrated Director Ever,3,31 December 2006,"He was great directing Das Boot, but other than that, he has proved with this horrible third installment of his underwater epics that he cannot direct actors, lest we forget those wonderful performances by the vapid George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg in the Far Less Than Perfect Storm. Wolfie, it's time to retire. It just ain't clicking' anymore. Josh Lucas has proved with this and his real star turning performance in Glory Road that he cannot open a film. In a movie, it's nice to have character development. That's basic screen writing 101. This one was too worried about having the special effects kick in no later than 15 minutes into the film. The original worked because Ronald Neame gave us characters we could care about. Who cares if the character live or go under in this one? We have no idea why the mother with the annoying brat is a single mother. We can't begin to deduce why Dylan gets all verklempt. And why are we given such ridiculous characters as Lucky Larry?

425,HolyGabriel-1,Poseidon psucks,4,8 May 2006,"Poseidon is the epitome of mediocrity, and the only surprises it has are ones that are unbelievably lame.The end, in particular is pretty amazing. The remaining people are in a life boat...that came out of nowhere after they crawled through a propeller that they melted/destroyed/whatever with a what looked like a fire extinguisher, but I digress...and our hero Josh Lucas shoots a flare into the air, and as the flare fades, it morphs (with a cool sound effect) into two rescue helicopters, and then the survivors start cheering, and all is well.Before that, we have severely underdeveloped characters, but the one that sticks out is Dreyfuss, who starts the movie's new years celebration almost-crying on a phone asking for his ex-wife or someone to call him back, for old time's sake. But then, nothing is ever made of this ever again, and he's basically just the old white guy with an earring who goes along for the adventure.I guess Wolfgang has something against Hispanics, because one is kicked off of Dreyfuss' legs as an elevator is falling down a shaft, and another is electrocuted under water.The gas tank pouring down through the middle of a room into a giant mass of water, and then catching on fire and making a ridiculous fire shoot was pretty intense, and when Josh Lucas did a swan dive into the fire so he could swim across with a fire hose to find a way to get Emmy Rossum united with her boyfriend, who had just proposed to her that night...it was almost too believable for words.Besides all of that, the dialogue is completely stale, and Josh Lucas even says something to the extent of, ""I'm going by myself, I work better alone"" it pretty much defines his character because his actual character has none. But the best line has to be when they're in an area with a pressure valve, and there's a line like ""That's a pressure valve. It needs a lot of pressure."" Oh, and the kid they have along with them gets caught in some kind of cage at one point, and the mother finds him and asks how he got in there, and the kid says ""I don't know, but the water is getting really high!"" And it tries to raise the stakes without ever caring to explain how anything happens.That's basically it, and I know my review is disjointed, but it's because I can't convey how bad it really is. It might be worth sneaking in at the end to see the flare morph into the helicopters, but that's only if you never want to stop laughing.",Poseidon

I certainly didn't go in expecting an Oscar winner or a masterpiece. All those people who did are delusional.All these talks about the movie's lack of characterisation, clichéd and etc etc are just nonsensical. One BBC review summarised it best as ""Titanic without the dull bits."" I don't think the lack of fleshing out the characters hurt the movie. King Kong and Titanic spent a long time fleshing out the characters and both basically crumbled under its own weight with its artistic pretensions. Their characters were laughable and the stupidity of the script is beyond belief.If you like to watch a movie with a tight focus on the disaster action, lack of annoying characters and a good take on the usual clichéd elements, the movie is for you. If you are looking for an bloated and overinflated movie with artistic pretensions, overly ambitious characterisations and illogical stupidity, then you're better off checking out Titanic and King Kong.It's hardly Wolfgang Petersen's best movie.

Every two seconds I was saying, ""oh my god!"" I thought that it was coordinated wonderfully, and the directing was phenomenal. Lots of people are complaining that the character development was horrible. I thought that the characters were fine. You got a sense of what they were like and developed throughout the movie. If we had to read too far into each character, it would have taken too much emphasis on them, away from the big issue. I thought that the way the characters were developed improved the plot, and it made me personally feel more in the movie. Because this movie is about a bunch of strangers trying to survive together. So not knowing each character's life story helped along in the plot. The action of this movie was extremely intense and constant. But the drama only affected me in certain parts of the movie. I will tell you that I cried, a lot. I thought that it was extremely sad in some parts. It was a bit disturbing at some times too. So just a warning.

428,the_bloke33,And there was me thinking modern remakes were over the top?,6,18 February 2007,"Poseidon and the original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" are indeed different films all together. The only similarities between the two films are the fact it's a boat called Poseidon that gets hit by a wave on New Years Eve. The characters were indeed different in this remake, in ways it was a shame we didn't get to know them as well as the original, but that doesn't matter.As of all Hollywood films these days, a fortune was spent on the effects and this films CGI could be spotted a mile off. However, for a change, the special effects were actually called for! Instead of frankly being in the way like in most films you get these days.However, I think they rushed into the sinking too fast.

Perhaps because of that, I ended up enjoying myself more than I expected.The movie gets off to a bad start. Each character gets a total of five lines of dialogue to ""establish"" themselves. The scriptwriters evidently considered characterization an onerous task that needed to be gotten out of the way as quickly as possible. As soon as everyone's had their five lines, the rogue wave hits.From that moment on, the movie sprints into fast-paced action and never stops. They don't waste one second, it seems like - no sooner is one danger overcome when another presents itself. By not giving us time to stop (and think), the movie maintains its momentum right until the end.There isn't much that's original, evoking ""True Lies"", ""Armageddon"", and, of course, the original ""Poseidon Adventure"". Still, the movie's action scenes are well-constructed and evenly paced, and if you allow yourself to get caught up in it, you'll have a good ride.This movie isn't a masterpiece, nor is it likely to be remembered for years like the original was. But for a mindless ninety-minute adventure movie it's not bad. I'd say it's worth the price of admission, so long as you set your expectations correctly.",Poseidon

The sets didn't seem to have that much work put into them, and you couldn't really tell the boat was supposed to be up-si-down.The emotion of the characters seemed a little off, and it felt the whole movie as if something were missing.Now for the highlight of the movie. The actor Jimmy Bennett, who played Conor James, was just wonderful. He had every emotion of a 10 year old boy you would expect in that situation. The whole movie, the audience cares more about him than anyone else on the boat.

I'm not saying that it was so terrible, but you would get more enjoyment from the original movie, like most movies do.The cast of the movie was pretty well picked I thought. Josh Lucas' character wasn't very realistic. Of course when you do a remake of a movie that was considered a classic, you must have veteran actors. That's where Kurt Russel and Richard Dreyfus come in. They delivered excellent performances as usual.As far as suspense and thrills goes, the movie does have you worried at some point, but if you saw the original, you can basically tell what will happen. The funny thing is that this movie doesn't have the original characters, yet they do have little things that some of the other characters did in the original Poseidon.This movie is made for any fans of the original, even though it wasn't as good. The movie does keep to theme and it adds a little bit more of our generation to the film. If you don't like to see dead people floating around everywhere, this really isn't your movie.

Due to improved technology since the original movie was made, the special effects in this version were much better (especially the external shots of the ship). Like most remakes, a lot of people just want to see the story replicated with new actors. There have been several disaster remakes; the most recent being Pink Panther.

433,jsteele-2,Not worth the time or money,2,11 May 2006,"A not-so-good remake of a not-so-good original. The movie wastes no time getting to the action, which is both a blessing and a curse. Sure, we all want to see the wave flip the boat but it wouldn't have killed the director to invest more than 7 minutes establishing some character development. Each survivor is given about 1 line of dialogue to start so we can pretend to know them or care. One's gay, one's divorced, one's a jerk, one's in love, one's overprotective, one's carefree etc. But that isn't enough for us to give a hoot when some of them die. The dialogue is atrocious and the action jumps around from scene to scene to quickly that they must have cut some quieter moments in favor of non-stop action. And the action isn't really all the good or original. We've seen it all done before and we've seen it better. It's an OK movie if you just want to veg out and be mildly entertained but if you want to be emotionally drawn in as well, it's the wrong film.",Poseidon
434,Horseman123,Racist and Stereotypical Movie At Best...,1,21 September 2006,"When I first saw the picture of this movie I thought it would be a nice thriller. Boy was I wrong. This film has decidedly realistic tinge to all of its visuals. But what ""comes to life"" here is nothing short of grisly scenes of people dieing in a more realistic way than past oceanographic fear films. Scenes of people that really look like people dieing, being impaled, electrocuted and drowned certainly come through as crisp special effects.I really wonder where the 150 million dollars came in? It was bad acting, bad dialogue, bad script the only decent thing were the special effects. But even those were not needed.What really got me going was the extreme racism and stereotypes in this movie. The few minorities are superstitious nonentities meant to fill up a body count, and we are also forced to ask: Why is that architect gay, anyway? Not to say that movie characters of different sexual orientations should justify their existence, but he only seems to be gay in order to mock homosexuals. His big gay-reveal also comes with a visual reveal of a diamond earring, he threatens suicide after breaking up with his boyfriend, and as a perilous escape is mounted, he mentions at a rather inappropriate moment that a fellow survivor, whom he later kills to save himself, has a pretty name.The Latin guy is pushed over and killed by the rich white characters. The Latin girl is the only one to panic and die. The black captain advises everyone to stay put and he and many others die. The Latina singer(fergie) also dies. The homosexual character dies. And both the Latins are poor, one snuck on board and one is a waiter. What this movie is basically saying is if you are white, straight and rich you will survive.I myself am white and I'm tired of seeing all this nonsense in Hollywood. Nowadays when we have very diverse audiences in such why aren't we seeing more roles going to minorities? Lord of the rings, Chronicles of Narnia? Has it finally become a rule that minorities are now allowed to high budget films due to old white crusty klan folks and narrow minded people? Oh Hollywood if only your IQ matched your wealth.",Poseidon

If you go and watch a movie called Poseidon you should expect to see a big ship go belly up and then a fight for survival and that is exactly what we get. I saw the original and found it slow and boring compared to this version.

436,gmh701,"Good Thriller, but a little Rushed",6,5 November 2006,"Okay. The basic storyline is that a huge luxury cruise liner gets capsized by an even bigger rogue wave, and 7 or 8 passengers who are actually smart try to escape before they die. I thought throughout the entire movie: ""Wow"" or was on the edge of my seat, and really was kept in suspense. For those who think that this is a spin off of ""Titanic"" you're wrong... and right. This only has a little bit to do with love, and is mainly disaster-related. (Titanic spent 2 hours and 30 minutes showing romance; only 30 on disaster. This spends 1 hour and 49 minutes on disaster.) I thought it was really good, had exceptional CGI effects, and kept me in suspense, but I still have some complaints. 1) The movie was rushed, and had no storyline depth. 2) The characters were well acted, but (and I usually don't complain about his) have no background 3)The life raft at the end of the movie just happened to be in the ocean unscathed, and 4) They killed off some characters that I didn't want killed off. If you are disturbed easily (dead bodies!) then I wouldn't recommend this movie. There are a lot of dead people shown in detail in this movie. Also, if you just fall in love with stories with really complicated story lines and want to think, this is not for you. The storyline is kept simple (very simple.) Overall, 6 stars/10 stars. Probably the movie that has kept me in suspense the longest (I haven't seen many, though). Here are some stats: 1 hour and 49 minutes long. Rated PG-13 for Intense Prolonged Sequences of Disaster-Related Peril. Has no sex scenes. Has some disturbing images. A little amount of blood. Stars Kurt Russel, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Emmy Rossum. No nudity (another instance in which this is more appropriate than ""Titanic."")

This is the sort of action-adventure disaster movie I wish Titanic had been instead of a 3-hour snooze-fest. There were several parts that were incredibly gripping.

The original had great interaction between the actors and the viewer felt a connection to every actor and every scene. The original also in some ways had better special effects. I will admit that the first scenes in the original when the ship was first hit by the wave were terrible, but after that the scenes were better. You really felt like you were on a ship when you watched the original. The remake focused too much on computer effects and many scenes were laughable. The remake also centered on political correctness and was probably made in Berkley. I hated every actor except perhaps Kurt Russell and could not connect with a single actor and wished that they all would die. I know that I almost died watching this bomb. Most of the newer actors were completely forgettable and their acting was sub-par. I am not even sure who most of the newer actors were.

However, this version of the original Irwin Allen classic is severely lacking in character development. (Allthough it is *FAR* better than the NBC mess a few months ago....) The original, while not perfect, had a story to it.... It had characters, and it had actors to back it up. We had Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, Maureen McGovern, (who had a hit song from the movie), and the affable Shelly Winters, who chewed up the screen with gusto every time she was on. This time, to hold up the movie, we have Kurt Russel, Richard Dreyfuss, who plays an aging gay man who looks like your typical New York Jew right out of central casting, (Please don't think I'm being racist here, but OY!) and Emmy Rossum. Poor Emmy.... She went from an Oscar nominated performance as Christine in ""Phantom of the Opera"", to this movie.Don't get me wrong, I do care for the characters.... I believe Emmy Rossum when she says that she cares for her son.... It's just that Peterson puts in too many whiz-bang special effects and action, and not enough character development. The ship flips in the first few minutes, without even giving us any real time to really get to know the characters.This film is shorter than the original, and I think Peterson could have given us at least a little more time to build up the backstory, instead of rushing from one action scene to the next. It almost felt like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, where as soon as he's out of one mess, he's in a worse one. It's a watchable movie, but it feels like mostly sizzle, and hardly any steak.",Poseidon
442,sycamorematt,No Heart and Soul,3,11 June 2007,"When I say that this movie is a tragedy, I don't mean that it's about a tragedy. With all of the things going for this film it still manages to be a rather lackluster action-adventure film. I should mention that I find it somewhat humorous that they would drop a word like ""adventure"" out of the title for the remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and that they actually took a lot of the adventure out of the plot line as well.At this point I should probably point out that I'm a fan of the original 1972 version of the film. If you're unfamiliar with it the film stars Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Leslie Nielsen, Shelley Winters & Red Buttons. It's a delightful film full of much more tension, drama and much better performances by the principal actors. All accomplished before the advent of CGI. They put out a special edition last year that I would recommend and the commentary by director Ronald Neame (who is 95 years old, Way to Go Ron!) is the most intelligent and humble that I've ever had the pleasure to experience.The original was an epic film that was just under two hours in length. The remake comes in at about an hour and forty minutes but somehow manages to pack significantly less punch. The film begins with a somewhat cursory introduction to our principal characters that seem to have few virtues and, consequently, when tragedy occurs you have very little interest in rooting for the characters. Their plights are totally clichéd and unfortunately the talents of four very fine actors (Kurt Russel, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss and Emily Rossum) are wasted on these shallow characters.Be careful while you watch it, if you do see it, because you'll miss Josh Lucas saying that he was in the Navy. This throwaway comment early in their trek is meant to explain his in-depth knowledge of cruise ship design and operation. The reckless and cavalier way in which the male leads route their way through air vents and flooded corridors are patently absurd. I don't think that anyone can believe that you would blindly swim through a submerged passage with no idea where it leads or if there's air within a reasonable distance but these characters charge forward in every scene. Not only that but the seeming lack of stairwells and doors on this luxury cruise liner makes absolutely no sense.Theirin lies the recurring theme of Poseidon. The faith of the filmmakers that the audience will care for such tepid characters makes no sense. The belief that the audience will take the characters numerous brushes with death seriously makes no sense. Lastly, thinking that we really care if the characters, live, die, get rescued or sprout gills and start their own society of highly evolved sea monkeys (maybe I should pitch that plot to Hollywood) in no way, shape or form makes sense.To say that I was disappointed by this film would be quite an understatement. The original cost about five million dollars, grossed almost eighty-five million in 1972 and has become a film classic. I think that the studio will be lucky to do as well and feel confident in saying that this movie won't have the legs of it's predecessor.",Poseidon

See it, but keep an open mind, it's not realistic, but it's gripping nevertheless. It's really funny that already in the opening scene a major fault is made by the movie makers, a major fault which indicates something has to go wrong with this vessel. Intrigued??? When in the opening scene the virtual flyby of the vessel is done showing you it in all it's greatness you can't fail to notice that the lifeboats of the vessel are hung the wrong way around, the propellers which are at the back of the lifeboat are facing forward (there is actually a lot of details that are surprisingly realistic and possible).",Poseidon

445,boba33c,Hokum with flaws,5,2 June 2006,"It is difficult to vehemently hate this movie, primarily due to the performances of Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss. They ham up their roles fully aware that they are in a remake B-movie that's not going to set the world alight but might keep people entertained for a while.The scene where the wave hits, which you would expect to be the most spectacular, is disappointing but then maybe we take CGI for granted too much these days. Petersen does crank up the tension on a couple of occasions and people were genuinely squirming in their seats but there were too many moments when the scene had reached its denouement and then Petersen just cuts elsewhere. It feels as though you've missed a scene through poor editing whereas it might be more of an attempt to keep things moving along.I was surprised that there were so few ancillary actors meeting cruel and unusual deaths as the band of merry survivors made their escape, I'm sure I remember several, more emotional deaths in the original.

The success of Titanic can be attributed to a great extent to the heartfelt love story of Rose and Jack and the amazing chemistry between them. Poseidon harbors no Jack, and no Rose either. The adequate cast, most notably Josha Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss, are left with an abominable script, relying on cheap action thrills to mask the shallow and unsympathetic characters.The numbing and seemingly endless sequence of narrow escapes doesn't capture the viewers attention in the slightest, and pulls out every cliché in the book along the way.

There were times during the movie in which i felt that it was focusing on too little within the number of people that were going to make it out. There's not a lot to say about this movie except that it brings you down to reality instead of escaping. To say the least it was good based on the effects of the ship. Overall i gave this a 5.5 because it didn't quite live up to the hype that it was expected to. I happened to see the remake on TV last night and it's quite comparable to this one. Not a whole lot of changes, the parts played by Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss were well done. Anyone who is a fan of them or of the series will in most case enjoy the movie overall.

448,andrea_valenti8,"I love Wolfgang's work, but....",6,14 March 2012,"This is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience. I'll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheeseball line (""Where is the disco?"" ""Why, you feel like dancing now?""), but I set its cringeworthy dialogue aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie. The giant tidal wave capsizing the luxury liner Poseidon would take care of that, leaving only a small group of people fighting to reach the top and get out.Another thing, besides special effects, that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure (1972). Make no mistake however, these characters are still dumb to the core, getting by on lucky circumstances, occasional heroic feats and conveniently appearing objects and hatches – you've seen it all before, but damn, this is sensationally quality action.Overall, Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fast-paced as any action film you'll see.

It definitely won't disappoint you if you're looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks. I'd even happily sit through this experience again.6.5/10",Poseidon

Unusually for a Wolfgang Peterson film, there is little in the way of character development which leads to a sense of ""who cares"" when the cast are placed in danger. This could explain why the film is only an hour and a half long - maybe an extra twenty minutes (on the cutting room floor perhaps?) explaining the background of the lead characters would have drawn the audience in more. A case in point - when Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are about to open a door that they have already shown is blisteringly hot Russell turns to Lucas and asks ""You tour on the subs?"" to which Lucas replies ""I wouldn't call it touring.."" This obviously points to Lucas's character having been in the navy though this is the first and last reference to it.

You have hits like ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Troy"" under your belt, and then there is ""Poseidon"": possibly the worst disaster film.I think when I am giving a rating of 5, I think I am being generous here. I saw some great potential when the trailer was first shown, but when I first saw the run time of only 98 minutes, I knew it was going to be very flawed.And very flawed a movie it is; the main problem is there is no character development. You needed another screenwriter who knows what he is doing. You don't get involved with the characters, nor the characters aren't that very interesting, except for maybe the arrival of our hero character, Dylan, played by Josh Lucas. The only actor that stands out, despite his character being gay (not to be prejudice to anyone), is Richard Dreyfuss. Kurt Russell as former mayor/firefighter Robert, is virtually unwatchable in my opinion, as his performance has no life whatsoever, and is seriously flawed.I will give my thumbs up to the Oscar-nominated special effects. Top notch stuff. The visuals are amazing and beautiful to look at. But in the end, that is the only real thing that stands out for this film.Maybe somebody like James Cameron could've handled the job better, and in turn, maybe deliver a stunning masterpiece, unlike it was. Again, it could've been quite a movie, but instead was ruined by a short runtime and lack of character analysis.

451,jjhora,"We had Wolfgang Petersen, the director of Das Boot and The Perfect Storm! So, what went wrong with Poseidon?",5,17 June 2013,"Poseidon is a 2006 theatrical remake of the original Disaster Film The Poseidon Adventure from 1972, and is loosely based on the 1969 novel by Paul Gallico. Being released through Warner Bros. Pictures, Poseidon (2006) was written for the screen by Mark Protosevich, directed by Wolfgang Petersen and featured Josh Lucas, Kurt Russell, Jacinda Barrett, Emmy Rossum and Richard Dreyfuss; co-starring Mike Vogel, Mia Maestro, Jimmy Bennett, Kevin Dillon, Freddy Rodriguez, Andre Braugher and Stacy ""Fergie"" Ferguson. The film received a running time of 98 minutes, and a solid PG-13 rating from the MPAA. Being cast in the shadows of a highly successful and critically acclaimed original classic, Poseidon garnered mostly negative reviews from critics and movie goers; with most people, though, praising the special effects used throughout the film. Overall, we had Wolfgang Petersen, the director of Das Boot and The Perfect Storm; so, what went wrong with Poseidon?At midnight on New Year's Eve, the S.S. Poseidon was struck by a rogue wave and capsizes in the middle of the open ocean; leaving thousands of passengers either dead, or stranded in an inverted ballroom. Realizing that Captain Bradford (Braugher) was mis-informing the passengers on staying put, duo Dylan Johns (Lucas) and Robert Ramsey (Russell) decide to lead a group of survivors (Rossum, Barrett, Bennett, Dreyfuss, Maestro, Dillon, Rodriguez, Vogel) through an inverted inferno of fire and water; with hopes of reaching safety at the bottom, which is now the top, of the cruise liner. Having ignored heeded warnings from the desperate group, those left in the ballroom become immensely overpowered by the entire ocean as the windows burst and the ballroom becomes completely engulfed. Following this tragic occurrence, the entire group now faces danger completely and utterly alone. Will they all, if any, reach safety? Well, watch Poseidon (2006) in order to find out...I am a huge fan of the original film, not of the sequel or television remake that followed. However, I was very disappointed with Poseidon. I am a big fan of Wolfgang Petersen and have enjoyed his previous films, so the question remains: Petersen, what did you do here?! The storyline was as straight-forward as they come, and there was almost no set-up or character development whats-so-ever. The characters, Maggie James (Barrett) and Lucky Larry (Dillon) especially, were somewhat unlikable; and, with wishy-washy character build-up, you really didn't feel for these passengers; making you not care whether they lived or died. That is a shame to say, but its true. Poseidon had too short of a running time, and lacked the heart and soul that The Poseidon Adventure (1972) carried. The final negative comment about this film is Fergie as the Entertainer, no, we didn't need a Charo impersonation. I know I have revealed many negative details about this movie, but it doesn't necessarily mean that I hated the film altogether. In fact, I thought the special effects were quite impressive and the scenes where the characters were crawling through the inverted ship, very well done and intense. Top that off with a very realistic, if not too realistic, drowning scene from one of the principal characters. I like the whole idea of characters in fancy clothing crawling through oil, debris and tight spaces haha, sorry, but its the truth. This film didn't deserve Razzie Awards per-say, but I can definitely see why it received negative reviews; that part and the reasons behind it are clear.Having said all this, Poseidon (2006) was not a completely awful movie, but just an average Summer Blockbuster that didn't do very well at the box office. This was not up to the standards of Wolfgang Petersen, and he has done so much better in the past with The Perfect Storm, Air Force One, Das Boot and Outbreak. I wouldn't say avoid this movie, because it does have some redeeming qualities, but overall, it just doesn't come anywhere near topping the original film. If you want a pure adrenaline rush and wall-to-wall action, then Poseidon (2006) is your movie! If you want a good story, decent character development and suspense all rolled up into one; well, then The Poseidon Adventure (1972) is your movie!Poseidon (2006): 5/10 star rating.",Poseidon

Film starts with such a non starter, it doesn't give any feeling of movie having started. characters are Inserted in a way that you can clearly make out that they are forced upon you and it doesn't even give any time for audience to get familiar with them or build any sort of connection. It looks like movie is forcibly accelerated very soon and you see things start happening. i don't know if it was a conscious decision to make it a 100% rescue operation movie. Out of thousands of people in the wrecked ship, a handful are selected and they become your main protagonist group. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, problem in this movie is that you hardly get emotional or happy to see this group failing or succeeding in their mission points. One is just not able to build any sort of emotional connect with any of the group members. Besides this mis-timed script, movie has some of the most wooden acts ever seen on the big screen. Acting is so below par and i don't understand what on earth made an actor like Richard Dreyfuss to be involved with such a script or a group. Same applies for Kurt Russel as well, rest of the cast is not worth mentioning at all.I am still shocked that this movie is from the same director who gave Das Boot and Outbreak, besides some other entertaining movies.

The characters never get developed at all but I still didn't want them dying horrible deaths. And I know that shouldn't be a brief oversight but I don't need incredibly complex characters in an escape movie (personally).My favorite scene is the elevator shaft scene. The hint of the elevator about to drop and the characters frantically walking across the plank and climbing up was great. I also enjoyed the scene where they have to unscrew a bolt in a shaft but nothing seems to be working. Those scenes plus the awesome set design, plus main characters dying, and the overall theme of a boat flipping upside down made me love this movie. There were many questionable moments like how the kid got lost, no other people being around, impossibilities of ship design and the raft's conveniency but they only briefly stopped my enjoyment.

455,fox7x,Was Half the Movie Cut Out for the Sake of Running Time?,7,20 May 2006,"Poseidon, in many ways, had three strikes against it from the start. First off, it's a remake of an already beloved disaster movie (the definitive disaster movie, by some accounts), secondly it was made in an era when content and character are at the mercy of the studio-minded editor and finally, it debuts in a time not known for warm box office receptions. Still, master director Wolfgang Peterson makes a credible effort here and manages to give us an entertaining action flick. It's not as fleshed out or as enthralling as Das Boot, Outbreak or Air Force One, but it is fun.STILL, there were a few problems...I felt as though the editors of the movie cut a good 45 minutes of character development out of the film just to keep what the men in charge felt was a decent running time. We're only given twenty minutes or so to get to know our heroes before the ship is capsized. The original movie gave us a little over a half hour to get to know everyone and then maintained the character driven plot throughout. There seems to be a really horrible trend in Hollywood these days stating that the average movie goer will become bored after an hour and a half so keep it short (Star Trek Nemesis suffered this fatal blow as well...). I say that kind of thinking is a bunch of hooey. I'll sit through a four hour film if the characters and story are well rounded and interesting. Titanic, Lord of the Rings and King Kong should be indicators that the people love a good story, not a short running time. I felt a little cheated on the characterizations, because I know all of the actors involved in this movie are capable of seriously intense performances. Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas got the lion's share of the drama, but there wasn't enough to go around. It's Dreyfuss who ends up being the heart of the movie, followed by Russell and Lucas. Everyone else has their moments, but for the most part are relying on reactions to the disaster around them.If you're gonna remake a movie there was nothing wrong with, then pay attention to what made it great! Getting to know Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and the rest in the original movie was a personal investment the film required of the viewer. Whether your liked the characters or not, you cared about what happened to them. You felt the pain of the characters through each trial, argument and tragedy. Ernest Borgnine and Stella Stevens as the cop and former prostitute couple made you laugh AND cry. Gene Hackman and Shelley Winter's scene near the end of the movie is one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen on film (made even more tear-jerking by the support of Jack Albert's reaction to it). Hell, even Leslie Nielson's brief cameo carries heavy weight.Oh Wolfgang, come on man. The original Poseidon Adventure was a dark action-tragedy. This is the stuff you were meant to do. What happened???All this being said, Poseidon does stand well on it's own. Tight direction, top notch special effects (far better than the sinking of the Titanic if you ask me) and an easily likable cast make the journey familiar and fun. It's a big, classy action piece that pays a certain amount of homage to the original classic, and yet performs like a bare bones speed machine. It looks great, it's a comfy ride and yet it goes so damn fast you don't really get to enjoy the journey. It's all over before it really begins.I'm hoping for a director's cut DVD edition. I have a feeling the best parts of this movie are laying on the cutting room floor. Because really, when you get right down to it, the moments that stick out in my mind about the original aren't the special effects or the action sequences, it's the characters. The actors and their characters made the original brilliant, tragic, fun and poignant. The new Poseidon should have and could have had the same grace.Poseidon, we hardly knew ye...",Poseidon
456,nowshowingtv,"""Poseidon"" sinks",5,8 May 2006,"The original is a favorite of mine and I was looking forward to the new version, but it's all style, spectacle and effects over any kind of character development. The capsizing scene is amazingly well done, although it happens too quickly. In the original, the ship began to list a bit before the wave hit and here it just rolls right over. It's a wonder the thing could even stay afloat at all! But it is still a very cool scene (we even get to see people on deck and in the pool as the wave hits). Unfortunately, without the character development, you really could care less who lives or dies. If you like mindless action flicks then go see ""Poseidon."" Otherwise, pick up the original on DVD (a new special edition just came out).",Poseidon
457,dfreeman-7,Poseidon,9,22 June 2006,"I have seen this movie and, though Wolfgang Peterson is one of my favorite directors, he tells his story more in the visual than in character. In other words, he'd rather fill a movie with all sorts of dazzling special effects, play a lot with CG, fill huge tanks with water and life-size boats on ""gimbles"" than to tell a more ""human"" story. His main characters were the special effects rather that any humans acting in it. He assumes the audience simply isn't interested so much in what makes up the characters involved, just the need to play with them. In Poseidon, there is a massive amount of footage showing people falling to their deaths, victims of ""flash fires"", lots of cool underwater explosions and, his favorite, CG. Unfortunately, character development doesn't exist. In fact, the movie risks itself as being a modern ""B"" movie, with actors that don't deserve to play in such features. In short, Poseidon doesn't stand a chance to be a classic the original Poseidon Adventure was, and I don't think he intended it to be. Too bad.",Poseidon
458,grahamhills,It sunk,4,30 July 2016,"For whatever reason I forgot all about the Poseidon remake until I saw the original 74 movie a few nights ago. So I felt it was time to give it a go.Poseidon is sunk the second it begins, horrendous CGI ship animation, then there is the script, or rather the lack of it. And somewhere along the lines the rest goes wrong.Nobody in the film is likable, everyone has a back story nobody cares about, and death treated matter of fact, with no mourning at all, let alone discussion. Someone dies, and there is not even a ""oh my god they're dead"" moment, its all just terribly bad, and despite the copious amounts of cash spent on the movie, it looks incredibly cheap.While it might be nice to fill a void of time, check there is not something better you can be doing with it.",Poseidon

The beginning when they introduced all the characters I thought that you could get to know them if you tried and paid attention to the conversations. Sure parts of it were predictable, but that didn't make them boring really. I was gasping, trying not to cry and looking away at parts that I knew would happen, as well as parts that I didn't see coming. I liked how it ended, I liked how it began, I liked the middle, I basically liked it all. Sure I probably will never go on a cruise on New Years Eve, but I'm sure I'll live.Now I can't write a review on this movie without making a comment on the music, because I'm such a BEP fan. Fergie - or should I say: Ms. Stacy Ferguson - did a wonderful job with her songs, they really fit the movie. (And also I liked the way she died, it was very sad and in my opinion brave, how she was so calm, i thought she would have been screaming like the rest of the people.) The people who wrote her part, and Fergie herself, the people who wrote the whole thing, did not disappoint, and neither did this movie.",Poseidon
460,whoaitsholly,What a surprise!!,10,11 May 2006,"I decided to go see the advanced screening of Poseidon just for the heck of it because it looked interesting since I never saw the original one and plus I never knew what the entire story was really about. I was actually impressed with Poseidon. I think this was an EXCELLENT movie, from the special effects to the story line. Unlike most movies, I would be laying back in my seat thinking about what I was going to be doing after I saw the movie, instead, I was literally at the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happened next. The only problem I had was the fact that they made the film so short that it seemed as if the director was rushing to the end. Despite that, I would say Poseidon is definitely worth seeing a second time. But take note!! Titanic is not comparable to Poseidon, so don't be comparing it the whole time you see it.",Poseidon
461,macdreidle,Perfect example of why one shouldn't mess with a classic,5,12 May 2006,"Take away the special effects (which were pretty much standard), and you are left with NOTHING!. It was badly written with every punchline in the book. Dreyfuss was grossly misused, as was Andrea Brauer. The Characters were severely under-defined as were the relationships between the characters. I would choose Gene Hackman's, Red Button's and the late Shelly Winter's characters over any of these updated characters in this absolute sellout. Sorry... I have enjoyed most of Wolfgang Peterson's work, but this one has definitely disappointed me. Do not let the trailer fool you. It is a good trailer indeed, but aren't all trailers well crafted in order to make you go out and buy the ticket. Hey, It worked with me! The plot is familiar with the original but doesn't get nearly deep enough in order for us to really care, plus, this remake is considerably shorter than the original (1hr 38min) which, I would imagine is somewhat to blame for the director being unable to develop the characters. Anyway, just a movie right?",Poseidon
462,graphic8189,Nicely done,9,5 June 2006,"Poseidon takes place on New Year's Eve on a ship which is, incidentally, called Poseidon. A monstrous wave slams into the ship and turns it upside down. A small group of people form together to find a way out, ignoring the warnings of the officers. Well, what do you know? The officers were wrong. 6 people make it out together in the end.This film had some really cool special effects. Besides the wave turning the ship over, there were plenty of explosions to satisfy any fire-freak. Not to mention all the crash-bang-smash-kaboom paraphernalia.The only things I felt were not extremely realistic, was the fact that as soon as the survivors jumped out of the boat, there was an inflatable life-raft floating there waiting for them. Also, as soon as they got on the raft, the ship sank. Right out from under them.I also don't like how Hollywood makes it a point to put in a homosexual and have him survive just to send a message of acceptance to the viewers.

Overall, this movie's been panned as plot less, pointless, and ridiculous. No characterization, no build-up, no story--just WHAM! Wave hits, boat tips, and we follow a handful of passengers through the bowels of the ship. And you know what? I loved it! Sure it's cheesy, sure it's got more explosions than a Jerry Bruckheimer or John Woo movie, bad acting, worse dialogue, and predictable story (after all, we've all seen the original), but it was great escapism! There were tense moments and yes, there were silly, melodramatic ones, too. But, overall, it was a great thrill ride.Like I said, Irwin Allen would have been proud.",Poseidon
464,docbonkerz,A shallow movie out in the deep ocean.,7,14 May 2006,"I remember once, years ago, watching Siskel and Ebert tear into the first Power Rangers movie--slamming it for poor acting, static characters, and lack of individuality of the characters. Power Rangers was a pure, unadulterated children's movie that was, unlike Disney movies for example, not intended for ANY adult to watch and enjoy. It exemplified, in my opinion, the problem with movie critics: they love to criticize, even when it is not appropriate. And IMDb, unfortunately, is choc full of wannabe critics who think that writing negative reviews about movies exudes intelligence. It doesn't. It only shows, instead, that the world has too many people who are unable to tell the difference between a hammer and a screwdriver.Look at Hollywood's portfolio of movies. The products of Hollywood range from the likes of ""Shawshank Redemption"" to ""Robocop"" to ""Revenge of the Nerds"". I consider these to be equally good movies, but each in their own rite. The first is a meaningful movie meant to teach us about hope, the second is a clever satire on American society, and the third is intended to be pure slapstick entertainment. Each achieved its goal equally well.So why can't people recognize ""Poseidon"" for what it is, i.e. what the movie makers set out to do? Do all of these armchair movie critics think that the screenwriter and director of ""Poseidon"" set out to make one of the most meaningful of all time? Their comments on this site certainly suggest they do. They are, unfortunately, judging ""Poseidon"" using the same criteria as they would ""Shawshank Redemption"".Poseidon was meant to be about 100 minutes of cheap, meaningless thrills with a little romance and comedy thrown in for good measure. That's why I went to see it. That was the goal of the movie, and they did a fantastic job at achieving it. And for that, it deserves seven stars. For God's sake, the movie was truly entertaining! It seems that, unfortunately, too many people go to the movies expecting the same things from every film.",Poseidon

You know it is a disaster film, so why go to see it if you know you are going to hate it? I loved the FX in the film; the acting is as one can expect from an ocean liner disaster, because the escape is the plot to the film. This isn't Hamlet. What makes this film better than the original is the length of time from the start of the film to the rouge wave crushing and turning over the cruise liner. No draw out character development! However, I did not have much compassion for the characters as in the original; Belle Rosen or Linda Rogo. But then again, who could replace Shelly Winters in that underwater swimming scene! I think if you want to see a corny film, or a Cruising ham of an actor, go see Mission Impossible III. Ughhh!",Poseidon

There wasn't a mushy love story, which would have taken away from the movie. The acting was very good. Josh Lucas, Kurt Russel and Richard Dreyfuss played their characters very well. I enjoyed seeing Emmy Rossum play the stronger role. In all her other roles, she played played the weak and defenseless character. She has gained my respect as an actress. This was the first movie I saw with Mike Vogel, Jacinda Barret, and Mia Maestro, and I was impressed with their acting.The special effects in this film were impressive.

What, did all of the rags go out in a herd and feel compelled to rush back and vomit online? Here's a piece of advise: Don't go to an adventure flick expecting ""Revelation."" And for those of you thought the cast was nothing but pretty faces...who wouldn't want to see good looking people put thru the ringer in a disaster flick. When I go to the movies, I go to get away from reality. I sure wouldn't want to pay to watch some pie-eating', a@@ scratchin' do nuttin' in a movie like this (or any movie for that matter). Oh...and don't compare a movie that was made in the early 70's to something made 35 years later! Apples and oranges, people, apples and oranges.Poseidon was what it was, a magnificent eye-popping nail-biting wonderful disaster flick. Nothing more. I really enjoyed this movie. I was so thankful that the movie didn't waste an hour of my time with character development. In an adventure movie, I don't care about character development. I went to Poseidon to see the boat turn upside down! The actors in this movie were great! I mean honestly, who doesn't like Kurt Russell?! He's fantastic. The first movie that I ever saw Kurt Russell in was ""The Strongest Man in the World."" That was a wonderful family movie.And Josh Lucas! Wow!! He made me sit up and take notice. I've always thought of him as Russell Crows 'real' friend in ""A Beautiful Mind."" But I will be paying much closer attention to the movies that Josh is in. His devilish good looks and his incredible smile...not just a pretty-boy smile, more like a shark that can shred you if it was his desire...if you didn't fall into his blue, blue eyes first! And Richard ""show me the way to go home"" Dreyfuss, I will always love Richard best in Jaws. **I don't know if this will be a SPOILER for anyone or not, but I'll mark it as so, just in case...** My take on Richard's character being a jilted lover (gay or otherwise)is that in his depressed state of mind he is seeking attention and decides to take a jump over-board, thinking that someone will spot a floundering drowning man..and rescue him. But wait! What the...?! He takes one look at that rogue wave and thinks 'you know what, the cry for attention can wait.' Go see the movie and just ... enjoy!",Poseidon
468,kjkeb,Who cares who got drowned,4,29 May 2006,"Without bragging I have to admit I was at the European premiere of Poseidon and maybe I got caught up in the hype but having reflected on the movie it was garbage. Characters that had no profile or personality so who cared what happened to them. It was more an action film than anything else, with many flaws in the plot and the action. Having listened to the opening speeches by the director and the stars of the film at premiere you would be mistaken in believing that they had worked on a masterpiece and how they had worked so hard and put up with so much water !

I, for one, have never seen the original and totally loved this movie. Basically fitting into the same genre as the original (ala disaster movie), it does that so well. Takes a number of different characters, which I never found annoying anytime, and put them in a real bad situation. All of the acting was very convincing. I loved the few CGI shots there were, didn't find them distracting to the atmosphere. The real water and explosion shots are top notch. Wolfgang Petersen sure knows how to helm a movie involving water (Das Boot, Perfect Storm). For the pacing and action, buckle in and enjoy the ride. At 99 minutes including credits, there are no dull moments. I have no complaints about it whatsoever.To all the seemingly negative opinions this movie is getting, I offer this. If you go into a movie looking for a reason to dislike it or compare it to something that it's not, you have lost the point of going to the movies in the first place.Poseidon is a top notch action flick.

Josh Lucas has only two facial expressions: grinning or not, Kurt Russel is as granitic as always and Richard Dreyfuss... oh Richard Dreyfuss, where art thou?

Yes, we do find out some character traits as the movie progresses, but to me I just didn't give a care about any of characters. This could have been a great tear jerker, full of emotion.

472,dpac500,An enjoyable film but not really a remake,6,9 June 2006,"Poseidon can hardly be described as a remake of the original movie. In that there seem to be very few ideas which the new film decides to take on board. The film changes the original from one ministers attempt to save a few people, into one mans desperate attempt to save himself - even though he seems to collect a few hangers on. This costs the film a certain level of intimacy which made the original film what it was.However it must be said that the films special affects are greatly improved and this does add to the general overall feel of the film. It is far more possible to understand the few survivors impending doom while this ship continues to explode and sink around them. Thus adding a sense of urgency to the movie itself. I also thought that the drowning scene near the films climax was incredibly well acted, it was actual possible to see the mans struggle to stay alive.Overall the film was enjoyable and told the story of a few peoples struggle to stay alive on an upturned sinking ship. However by removing characters like Rev. Scott, the film lacked the impact of the original. However I would recommend a screening of the film to all, just go and watch it with an open mind and enjoy the roller-coaster that follows.",Poseidon
473,shannon-242,Is wrong in all the places it doesn't have to be,3,13 May 2006,"What great special effects. It would have been easy to suspend reality and really get into this film, IF they had not continually provided slaps in the face to remind the viewer that they were in a theater instead of on a ship. To use another movie as an example, in War of the Worlds, it is totally impossible to believe that Dakota's child character would be sarcastic and want to sleep upstairs in her own bed after seeing aliens fry a bunch of people. THAT is the kind of disbelief that is so wrong about this film. Kids do not wander away from their parents when they are scared crudless. Firemen do not forget how to give CPR. Children do not jump from great heights with a shrug of the shoulders because some strange man asks them to. People to not flirt when in incredibly precarious situations. I am not a nit-picker, but rather a guy who loves to immerse themselves in the experience. And stuff like this just slaps me into reality and keeps me out of the film. There is so much of this kind of stuff that by the last ten minutes of the film, you are incapable of eating the totally unbelievable stuff the climax is trying to feed you. I had heard somewhere that the makers of this film took great care to set a time line based on how long a ship could really remain afloat upside down. If so, then that is the ONLY thing they paid attention to, because the characters do not react in any kind of realistic way to the circumstances they are in, and the last 10 minutes of the film is just laughably unrealistic. It didn't have to be that way. If scared people acted scared, and the physical reality of the ship were kept to within even barely believable limits, this could have been a decent disaster thriller.",Poseidon
474,helpinghandchicago,Poseidon Sinks,1,11 May 2006,"In 1972 Irwin Allen (aka the ""Master of Disaster"") teamed with Director Ronald Neame to bring the first big budget disaster flicks- ""The Poseidon Adventure"". It featured and all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Ernie Borgnine, Shelly Winters, Red Buttons, Stella Stevens, Roddy McDowell and others. It was about a cruise ship that gets flip in the middle of the ocean and the struggles of a few brave souls to escape before the ship fills with water.Filled with special effects, Gene Hackman's character Rev Scott leads the few toward the bottom of the boat which is now on top. There is friction between he and Borgnine's character (Lt Rogo) as the two spar for the alpha male role. Shelley Winters and Jack Albertson portray grand parents (the Rosens) on their way home to see the grandkids. Lynley portrays Nonnie a cute gal with who Red Buttons character befriends and assists. There is tension; there is love; there is grief; there is heroism; there are sacrifices. Winters, Hackman and Borgnine shine. Stevens has great legs. You cared about them.Fast forward to now. Wolfgang Petersen, director of ""The Perfect Storm"", ""Das Boot"" ""In the Line of Fire"", ""Air Force One"", ""Outbreak"" etc. takes on the story in ""Poseidon"". Cast with a decent if not stellar group of talent including Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss and others--you'd expect at least comparable to the original. Oops. Wrong.While basically the same story, Petersen seemed more interested in how many times the ship could explode and his underwater shots than actually developing characters of interest. First noticeable flaw? EVERYONE CAN SWIM! I guarantee that if you grad 7 or 8 random people at any time, at least one can't swim. Let alone swim endlessly underwater. (Neame remembers this and Lynleys character is the rock.) Second, you are never quite sure of the characters. Dreyfuss' character, Rick Nelson is presumably a gay guy who gets dumped by his partner. But it is slurred over like an afterthought. I tend to think they saw the success of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Capote"" and decided to toss in the gay card. Russell is Robert Ramsey a former Mayor and firefighter, but now apparently wealthy and retired. I'll put it this way, wealthy enough to lose $40 grand in a poker game without flinching. He's having issues with his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancé Christian (Mike Vogel)-- though he seems to like the guy. Again you can't help but wonder is there real tension or not? There is a little boy, Conor, who is totally different from the boy in the original (a walking map). Conor is useless. There are others, but why bother because in the end you won't care about any of them. It might have been better if they failed! I found myself hoping they all would die. It might have made the movie better.There are two version of Poseidon, one in the IMAX format; that 's the one I saw. Again, oops.

The film was a pleasant surprise to say the least... it stays very true to ""The Poseidon Adventure"" for the most part, with small variations in the plot and characters for the sole purpose of making the update work. These changes are done tastefully though, as the don't affect the story in the least bit.Anyone who sees this film and complains about the unrealistic situations and responses clearly didn't understand what they were getting in to. Poseidon, like its predecessor, is as far from realistic as a film can get and that's exactly what was intended. It's basically a sci-fi movie in that it deals with scientific impossibilities, except it takes place in a place many people can relate to, leaving the film as a strange combo of sci-fi and action/drama. I ask you, what makes this movie any less realistic than ""The Day After Tomorrow"" even? Be warned, though - the cinematography is some of the most nauseating I've ever seen, especially in the beginning of the movie. It varies how bad it is at any given point, but all-in-all it was just annoying.

476,dane534,Not a Remake...,4,12 May 2006,"It is important to point out that this new film is only based on THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE ... it is not a remake. When a passenger ship (named Poseidon) is hit by a large wave on New Years Eve and capsizes, a handful of people struggle to escape. Other than that, do not expect any similarities -- not one character, not one line of dialog, not one scene...I first saw the original film when I was ten years old and have been a huge fan ever since. Surely TPA (as imperfect as it may be), was the catalyst that spurred my interest in ocean liners, architecture, classical music ... and Art Deco design. Therefore, I was excited about the latest film -- and pleased that it had been given to a talented director. I knew that the film and its characters had been changed/updated and was cool with that. But after viewing the new film twice now, I feel a bit let down.I don't want to touch on the stale characters. Although it is a major flaw, that subject has already been addressed again and again on this board.The cast (with the exception of Dreyfuss) are ALL buff and beautiful -- no fatties or uglies here. Of course, some of the physical obstacles in this film would require the endurance of a champion athlete and the bravado of a Schwarzenegger action hero! This is definitely not the motley group of survivors found in the original.The CGI graphics were very good. The ship was beautiful in a glitzy Las Vegas sort of way ... but the Poseidon never seemed very ""real"" to me. Perhaps it was all those overly elaborate CGI camera shots? Not really sure why. The Titanic certainly seemed ""real"" in TITANIC. But for me, the Poseidon seemed as plastic as the people on it.The capsizing sequence was stunning, but so many areas of the ship were highlighted in such a short time that I never really felt I was part of the action. There were no screaming passengers clinging/falling from overturned tables. No man falling backwards onto an illuminated skylight (a famous cinematic scene). And no Christmas tree!?! The Christmas tree played a pivotal role in the original film ... from passengers falling into it during the capsizing ... to it unexpectedly crashing down ... to the survivors climbing it (and Mrs. Rosen getting stuck in the spokes) ... to it falling back into the flooding Dining Room when panic ensues! Why leave it out entirely when there are so many cinematic possibilities? Instead the characters in the new film ""sneak out"" of the Ballroom using some stacked chairs. There is absolutely no plea for others to join them even though they know that anyone left behind may die. I suppose it says something about today's society ... ""I'm getting out of here -- to hell with everyone else!"". But these guys are supposed to be the heroes in the film?Don't expect much humor in this film either. I really missed the funny scene with the upside-down bathroom set. I can't imagine not working that into the new movie! But these new action-survivors don't seem to require toilets ... or rest. They keep going and going -- through one unrealistic scenario one after another!It was strange that the survivors find heaps of dead bodies everywhere they go, but never any other survivors. A ship this size would be expected to have over 4000 people on-board. Where are they? When our survivors merge in the Nightclub/Disco, they then struggle to find an escape route. So where did the 200-300 other people who left the room moments earlier go? And why can't our survivors seem to find a staircase/elevator core on this ship? Every modern passenger ship has several -- found every 200-feet or so. There is always one adjacent to the atrium (in addition to the grand stairway and glass elevators). Perhaps all the other people immediately ran up one of the usually ever-present staircases and escaped out a porthole hours earlier? That would certainly explain the absence of other people...I must admit that I missed John William's music from the original. I wonder why he wasn't hired to update his existing TPA score -- dramatic in all the right places and the deep ""bell"" sound accompanying the music is indeed haunting. And wouldn't it be fun for all us old-timers if they had used ""The Morning After"" (Academy Award-winning song from the original) and updated it in the new film?As fun as the original film may have been, I know that it is flawed, so some rewriting would be expected. And the producers obviously felt the need to update the original film to appeal to modern movie (and cruising) audiences. But this new version seems soulless. I feel that they may have been better off setting the film in 1972 and using the original campy script! That wonderful, but cheesy, dialog ran the gamut from the ridiculous to the sublime! Some of the quotes are classics! The new film's dialog is completely forgettable.I suppose that this new film is fine if you are not expecting much. I was obviously hoping that Petersen would turn the original film into another TITANIC. But this POSEIDON is what it is ... a mindless summer action movie with dazzling special effects. Should appeal to teenagers. Though it is doubtful that this new film will inspire many youths or ever become a cult classic.

I am an avid fan of the 1972 original, and I think that in many ways this one is better. 1) I think that it's much more realistic than the first, with the way that the ship would act while sinking. (I am an avid ocean liner fanatic) 2) I like the way that the story 'cuts to the chase' and doesn't dawdle around with complex plot lines, yet doesn't cut them out totally. 3) I consider the 1972 version more of a drama, and this one more of an action-flick with drama mixed in.This one is has been updated well too instead of trying to recreate a 'spoof' version of a 1970s style remake. I think that opting for a modern day version was the best choice. I also like the way that the ship has been accurately represented. Being a ship fan, I could tell that it was designed by someone who knew what they were doing, making it seem more realistic.Well worth your $8. Tear-jerking just like the original. Well done!",Poseidon
478,aerokiss,Poseidon,8,13 May 2006,"It's way better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed it because it didn't drag in the middle (like Titanic did) and had some incredible effects. It had the typical disaster escapee's - the hero, the father figure, the kid, the old man, the young girl etc. which made some parts of the movie fairly predictable (people die, dad saves the day, most of the ""escapee's"" escape to safety and the boat sinks), but it still made for an entertaining evening at the movies. Unfortunately I can't compare it to the original because I haven't seen it in years and don't recall the details of it. I recommend this movie to any action/adventure buff looking for a cheap movie thrill.",Poseidon
479,Jeff-W-W,"For those who saw the original, you will probably like this one.",8,16 May 2006,"Having just seen Poseidon just a few hours ago, I am impressed with the movie. I saw the original five times in the theater! If there was no such thing as Cable/Sat TV and film purchases and rentals as they are today, I would be seeing it again in the theater.The film varies from the original in different ways. The characters are different, as they should when you do a re-make. With the original, you get to know the characters very well before the disaster hits. With Poseidon, the action takes place just about 18 minutes from the opening credits. You really don't get to get a fair feel for the characters,the script seems to get rushed in that regard. You also don't get the feel of the tension of the incoming wave, as it was in the original. The radar screen of the wave in the trailers is not used in the film.The FX and camera angles are something to be thankful for. Even in '72, the FX could have been better. Here it is not over-the-top and seems to work well. As far as action scenes with the characters, there is no CG here. Real fires, real water. etc. There are some things that seem to make the film come close to ""Jumping the shark"" when it comes to the last 10 minutes of the film. I don't want to spoil it for anybody. I would have written it a little different. I think the writers wanted ""max action"" for the amount of film being viewed - and they did that for sure. As far as the feeling of ""being in the movie"" - I found myself holding my breath with the characters while they swim under water to get to the ""bottom"" of the ship. But I still can't get over how rushed the script is for ""action"". I won't comment about specifics scenes, as there are plenty here in the comment sections for you to view.Overall, WB did pretty good here with this one. The script could have been better though. It certainly was much better than that crap NBC did earlier this year with their own ""Poseidon Adventure"".",Poseidon
480,baller_2310,Just another remake!,3,18 May 2006,"Well, the actors did do there part but i have to say that this movie was just a cheap remake of the other film. I'm sorry to say that Hollywood messed up on this one. Sure it is a good movie i mean all action movies are great but if your one that goes for the details i mean who can swim for almost 3 minutes without breathing. Aldo, what a coincidence that once there free everything breaks apart. I have to say that if all you wanted to do was watch another remake its pretty good. To top it all of i have to say that the movie kept you pretty entertained but only if your not into the detail. In conclusion, the movie, like all of them, contained flaws, but a little too many. I think that i would rather rent it for 2 days in Blockbuster but i wouldn't pay to go watch it in theaters(even though i already did)",Poseidon
481,jericuy,The mourning after...,5,27 May 2006,"Hollywood's latest attempt in updating films from the 70s comes in the form of Poseidon. Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, The Perfect Storm) directs this re-imagined, digitized and hip-hopped version of the 1972 campy classic 'The Poseidon Adventure'. But unlike its predecessor, Petersen's Poseidon veers away from the characters of the novel that inspired the original film. So don't expect a turtleneck wearing, God-questioning TV evangelist/action hero, but instead we have Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), your garden variety New York fireman turned former mayor and now overprotective father. He is on the cruise ship with his daughter Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and her fiancé Christian (Mike Vogel). We are also introduced to Dylan (Josh Lucas), a high flying gambler who falls for single mum Maggie (Jacinda Barrett) and her annoying son Conor (Jimmy Bennet). Also floating in the background is lovesick, gay bachelor Richard Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss) and stowaway Elena (Mia Masetro). Their lives are thrown together when a rogue wave capsizes the giant ship and their instinct for survival drives them to find their own way of escape.The special effects in this version were definitely far superior to the original; however the computer generated images were exceedingly overbearing and made it feel like you were watching a screen saver. Mark Protosevich's screenplay was just a bit too concise and failed to rouse our sympathy and attention for the ship and its passengers. Instead, we are given scene after scene of explosions, fires, and floods of water. Although the characters faced situations that posed moral dilemmas on who gets to live or die, the actors were not able to use this to their advantage as this was easily resolved by virtue of ethnicity (Statistics showed that colored people are less likely to survive a sinking ship). The scenarios faced by the characters were all too familiar and made you think of the challenges that contestants tackled in Survivor, The Amazing Race or Fear Factor. One thing that was impressive was the visuals on the amount of carnage that took place. The burnt, electrocuted, crushed and drowned bodies were very realistic but still wasn't enough to keep you in your seat and prevent you from jumping into a life raft and head for the nearest uninhabited island.",Poseidon
482,chtwong,Worst remake ever seen,1,1 June 2006,"Weak plots, lacking character backgrounds, weak presentation, Come on, the Star Wars made the better of the new technologies and presentation skills!!Plot only focused on Kurt Russell's family matters and his daughter's being proposed to marry boyfriend.Kurt Russell being fireman and mayor not explained Many other character backgrounds not at all presented. The side stories are so weak and broken, not complete.Very weak special effects, the best is I suppose being the opening scene panning the whole outlook of the cruiser.Most of the physics in the movie are incorrect.The ending: The few survived people gave the wrong expressions and reactions to the helicopters arrival. They were overjoyed by the rescuers coming, but I think that reaction should be after they boarded the raft and survived the final big wave generated by the sinking cruiser. They should wait quieter waiting more calmly for the rescuers to fetch them.I want to black-list the director's films in the future. ..... Just rubbish...",Poseidon
483,Aquamariniac,"A really exciting, intense disaster film which will have most people on the edge of their seats.",10,1 June 2006,"""Poseidon"" is disliked by many people among this comment list. But I think they're all wrong. This film is a fantastic experience certainly worthy of a film watcher's time.The deluxe liner Poseidon is sailing the ocean with about 2 to 4 thousand passengers, celebrating New Year's Eve. But just as they enter the new year, a huge tidal wave knocks the fantastic ship upside-down, killing many people on board.A small group of survivors, led by gambler Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas) and troubled father Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), decide to make their way to the bottom (which is now the top) of the ship and escape before the water level sinks it. But it's not going to be easy; with a huge obstacle course of death in front of them, such as huge gaps and spinning propellers, they must work as a team if they ever want to see the light of day again...Gripping as a hook, ""Poseidon"" will certainly have your heart beating as the survivors get into all kinds of scrapes, and some great acting from Mia Maestro, Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell. It's also quite humorous at times (Lucky Larry is a good example) romantic, and fast-paced.As I said above, I don't agree at all with any of the haters of this film, because I don't see how anyone could hate an action-packed, fast-paced, nail-biting disaster thriller like this.",Poseidon
484,MarkItZero2154,"""POSEIDON"" is a must see for all fans of original!!!!!!!!!",10,5 June 2006,"""Poseidon"" was a movie that has a lot of things going for it. A great cast, great sets, and outstanding special effects. ""Poseidon still has its flaws, though.The characters all had interesting backgrounds to them, but they tell you this at the wrong times. Just as they work their way out of the kitchen, the Spanish girl, Elena, randomly begins to tell Richard Dreyfuss about her relationships with her old boyfriend. Maybe I'm wrong on this, but if someone was in a life-or-death situation like that, I really don't think they should be talking about things like that!Also, the ENDING. If you really think about it, the ending is impossible. The propellers was sucking everything out of the room next to them. But, what if, (when the ship was right-side-up of course), the ship went in reverse. That would mean that the propellers would suck all the water into that room, causing the ship to sink!Besides stuff like that, it was an overall very good movie. Director Wolfgang Peterson has made better movies than this, but it is still visually stunning. It is a MUST-SEE for all fans of the original.",Poseidon

486,wolfman71,overall quite good,6,17 June 2006,"Having seen the original and the remake almost back-to-back, the original is still the superior movie. Unusually for a Wolfgang Peterson film, there is little in the way of character development which leads to a sense of ""who cares"" when the cast are placed in danger. This could explain why the film is only an hour and a half long - maybe an extra twenty minutes (on the cutting room floor perhaps?) explaining the background of the lead characters would have drawn the audience in more. A case in point - when Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are about to open a door that they have already shown is blisteringly hot Russell turns to Lucas and asks ""You tour on the subs?"" to which Lucas replies ""I wouldn't call it touring.."" This obviously points to Lucas's character having been in the navy though this is the first and last reference to it. The action however is superb, the tension right there on the edge of your seat, and the special effects classy enough to make you believe it is all real. Overall quite good, just don't expect to care too much who lives or dies.",Poseidon
487,savannahtyler,Interesting but not accurate,5,1 May 2020,"The movie Poseidon is about a cruise ship that was struck by a rogue wave in the ocean. This wave as a result causes the boat to capsized and leads to the death of almost every passenger on the boat. This movie follows the action-packed journey of a group of passengers working together to escape the boat before it sinks. Throughout the story the passengers work against the clock as they overcome obstacles and challenges as and search for an exit off the overturned boat.
Overall, this movie was a fictious story and it showed; however, it was very interesting to watch and fairly entertaining. This movie started with a very large rogue wave that appears abruptly and hits the cruise ship. The wave portrayed in the movie had accurate parts and inaccurate parts. Something that was accurate in the movie was that rogue waves are extremely unpredictable and can come out of nowhere. This is something that is depicted in the film, but greatly exaggerated. Additionally, rogue waves are formed from a cluster of waves joining together to create a larger wave in the movie the sea was extremely calm. In addition, these waves are typically only about 50 to 80 feet tall at most. When comparing this height to modern cruise ships they are around 150 feet tall which is double the size of the average rogue wave height. This was not depicted well in the movie as the wave was several stories taller than the boat. This in return led to the boat being over taken by the wave and destroyed. Overall, this wave was depicted more as the size of a tsunami then just a rogue wave. In the event that this really happened the boat would have been stirred and the passengers would have been able to feel the wave, but it was extremely unlikely that the entire boat would capsized. As a result, no deaths would have been caused by this event, but it could have potentially caused some injuries and event damage to boats given the right conditions.",Poseidon

These lines are NOT from the ""re-imagining"" (God, I hate that term) now infamously known as ""POSEIDON"". But are from the ORIGINAL ""THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE."" Let's start there. FIRST...Why Warner Brothers would NOT call this film ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is just plain stupid. BORING title. SECOND...Why Warner Brothers would even WANT to take a trip down the ""Irwin Allen Brock Road"" again is anyone's guess. REMEMBER...The ORIGINAL Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno were Twentieth Century-Fox Pictures FIRST. (Yes, I know Warner's helped to co-produce The Towering Inferno--But Irwin Allen was under contract with Fox at this time, and was able to cut a deal so both studios would split the financials on Inferno). WARNERS, who signed onto the Irwin Allen Bandwagon 5 years too late, is responsible for giving us Allen's WORST films: THE SWARM, BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, and WHEN TIME RAN OUT...All 3 lost HUGE amounts of money, were subject to terrible amounts of ""tinkering"" on the parts of the scripts by Warner Execs. The results? THREE BOMBS of monumental proportions. All 3 were very good books however, yet not one of the three resembled the books at all. Now...Warner decides to trot down memory lane and remake a FOX epic that was the touchstone of the modern Disaster Film. OBVIOUS Post-production tinkering, shortening, re-writing, and changes were made to Wolfgang Petersen's film. Wolfgang Petersen...a MOST-COMPETENT director certainly had a better film in mind. I would LOVE to hear his comments on the ""cutting room"" of this film. Plot holes EVERYWHERE, no character development at all, and the ridiculous ""terrorist subplot"" could NOT have been ""his idea."" Warners, undoubtedly saw the Director's Cut, and likely said ""too mental""...we want more F/X. So they subsequently chopped up the film, rushed it into release (at an odd time to release a big-budget film--Mid-May--in order to NOT have to make it compete against the July 4th mega-hits), and when it flopped...they moved on. An awful slap in the face to Disaster Film lovers (but then again, Warners NEVER had any idea how to make a Disaster Film anyway), and a mind-numbingly ridiculous film became its product. ALL original characters are gone. FERGIE croons the dopey ""pre-capsize"" song, KURT RUSSELL copycats the ""self-sacrifice"" scene my drowning himself, Josh Lucas sticks his lower jaw out so far that he could probably cut thru the hull himself, and the Red Buttons character is scrapped for a more ""let's be in touch with today-crowd"" and instead becomes a whiny gay man who chucks his cell phone over the side and then hits on the waiter while climbing the elevator shaft. The Eric Shea character from the original is replaced by an annoying buck-toothed cry-baby who looks like Frodo Baggins without the ears. The captain is played by a (totally wasted) Andre Braugher, who has about 8 lines...yet who is probably the MOST CAPABLE actor in this entire film. (Even moreso that Dreyfuss the whiny gay cell phone chucking guy---as Dreyfuss hasn't made a good film in 20 years.) The film gets its FIVE stars for the special effects ONLY. The capsizing scene is AWESOME. The lady falling out of the elevator and going SPLAT on the glass below is an excellent cinematic scene. The flooding of the ballroom is brilliantly done (ALL this is credit to Petersen's talent with effects)...but the BAAAAD SCRIPT falls solely on the shoulders of Warners, and whatever hack let them OK this script. It is a real shame when it can be said that a STEVE GUTTENBERG Hallmark Miniseries is BETTER than a major motion picture. Guttenberg couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but at least HIS film had more plot development, showed due respect to the original premise, and at LEAST kept the names of Belle Rosen, Manny and Acres in it. Thank you DVD powers that be for the ability to ""Chapter Select"". if you watch this film...skip EVERYTHING except the capsize scene, the flash-fire scene, and the eventual sinking (where the ship actually rolls over AGAIN, and goes to the bottom UPRIGHT). A shame. But you can blame Sheila Allen for letting Warners destroy the picture that was not only THE ALL TIME Disaster Film, but also the legacy of her starry-eyed husband, who created TWO films that belong in a time capsule.",Poseidon

492,fpafu,This can turn out as being a quite enjoyable movie.,8,7 May 2010,"I would like to start off by saying that I have not seen the movie ""The Poseidon Adventure"" (the 1972 film that is considered to be the original), therefore my following review will not by affected, nor influenced by it.""Poseidon"" starts off with a very well-known scene, an impressive ship cruising somewhere in the middle of the ocean. What seems to scream 'cliché' though, is the fact that the whole action happens during the night. I was not particularly bothered by it, but is there some kind of law stating that movies based on this type of subject must not have their action placed during daylight? I have not seen one movie about a shipwreck, in my life, that concentrated its plot somewhere between, let's say, 9 AM and 7 PM. I am aware of the fact that producers need to make it harder for the characters to survive, but this is becoming overly exaggerated. And just a side note: we are given no indication of the ship's actual placement, people on board, arrival location and so on. It is not a disturbing factor, but it would have given the whole film a more realistic view.Moving on to the actual plot. We are presented the New Year's Eve celebration scene, in only a few seconds, then the giant wave hits. The viewer doesn't even have enough time to realize what's going on, before the culminating point actually ends and it is being moved on to another scene, in which a few brave passengers decide they want to survive, and try to find a way out. The same was with Titanic, Jurassic Park, 2012, The Cube trilogy and so on (basically any movie in which the characters had to run from something dangerous, in order to save their lives). The stereotype hits again – there is always a small group of smart people, in which we can spot a young, smart and nice-looking man, an amazingly beautiful and young woman and the rest of the gang, who seem to be following their lead like sheep. Not to mention the one factor that aggravates the situation, be it a handicapped person or an extremely helpless one; in this case it was a child, incapable of taking care of himself and needed constant observation.I heard people saying that the action happens way too fast and it is too easy to understand, leaving no mystery for the viewer. Not true, in my opinion. First off, the film itself is a big mystery, based on the question ""How do we get out of here?"". There is always something blocking the doors, the exits and the corridors. And the fact that there is always something going on leaves you with no time to get bored – a new impediment seems to appear every minute (and I am not even exaggerating). Besides, the whole crashing/sinking scene is extremely detailed, you can see almost every extent of the ship and it is very well presented.Overall, I enjoyed this film, with both its good and bad aspects and I definitely recommend it, especially to the fans of this genre. I would rate it 8/10.",Poseidon

This film is well worth spending money to see in the theater, if you're at all a fan of the disaster-film genre. Great special effects, little character development, and tension and excitement throughout. And when we say little character development, it's exactly as we hoped/expected...no time wasted with unnecessary dialogue, instead the film remains focused on delivering the goods.

They took less than 10 minutes to introduce us to the characters and then the action all began (normally that's fine but when your stuck there watching all this action and not at all interested at whether they survive or not...it hurts the movie).I found the movie completely clichéd and empty of anything new and exciting. Took a page right out of Armegedon with the Father sacrificing himself for his daughter and her fiancé.

495,mvidac,A disaster (of a) film!,1,1 February 2007,"99 minutes of my life I'll never get back ... Hey Hollywood ... how 'bout I just bend over next time?Wow! Where to begin? What a pathetic excuse for a movie! I just read through about 12 of the pages and it's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Though I am worried about the very few who raved about it  especially the guy (see page 15) who had seen it 3 times and was going back for a 4th ... a 4th!!! Let's see ... 396 minutes of this joker's life given to this movie (that's 6.6 hours to you and me, Russ) not to mention the money. Are you kidding? Did you just receive the gift of sight after a life of blindness? Were you raised by apes in the jungle? Wolves in the forest? Don't have movies on your planet? What could it be?First of all, why, why, why remake this? Laziness? Apathy? Maybe it was a dare. Whatever you do, DON'T bother to create characters and write a script! What a waste of budget that would be. Please spend it on obviously overdone CGI! What a miserable cast! I honestly didn't care if one single person made it out alive! In fact, I was rooting for Josh Lucas' overdone jaded gambler to bite it every step of the way! Note to Mr. Lucas: Matthew McConaughey called and he wants you to stop trying to be him!The only character I had one iota of concern for was Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez) who is promptly killed by Richard Dreyfous to save himself  just moments after having one leg over the railing in an 'I'm-despondent-because-my-lover-left-me' sulk. Wait! Maybe he was just disgusted that Fergie was the musical act of the evening! Come to think of it I might have sought other options myself ... So, you've got this meager cast of characters who you know only enough of not to like. Kurt Russell's character's daughter is a spoiled brat who immediately let's you know she will not be 'patronized' and had a miserable childhood with a father who was mayor of New York. Pity. Nope. Don't care if she or her fiancé make it  especially after the straight-from- daytime-soaps scene in the end! ""I need you to tell me you love me,"" he says as he dawdles so long before diving down to go turn off the propellers (they're only hope at this point) that Kurt Russell gets tired of waiting and sacrifices himself! Perhaps it was the bad acting that made him take the plunge. Who knows?Then there was the kid with the bad haircut and the tendency to wander off. *Sigh* I won't even go there. Within minutes the ship hits the wave and flips all with absolutely no warning yet the bridge is loaded with the most modern system out there. All we get is a 'did you feel that?' and then confirmation via binoculars that sure enough, death approaches in the form of an unannounced 'rouge wave!' Sound the alarm! Now we're upside down. The special effects were decent and it was exciting but it's over in seconds. When the dust settles we're left with a ballroom with chandeliers on the floor, bodies and debris everywhere but something's missing ... what could it be ... Oh!!! The Christmas TREE!!! The enormous tree that was conveniently bolted to the ground hanging from the now ceiling which allowed the original cast to climb out is not there!!! Here we go again, Hollywood. For the love of God  oops! sorry!  let's not offend anyone! 'We can't have a Christmas tree! Other religions will complain!"" I don't care if it was a giant menorah or if they shimmied up Buddhas face! That was a major scene in the original! Tsk! Tsk!Once out of the ballroom, the start button on the video game is pressed and we march on, obstacle after obstacle to the bottom  now the top  of the boat so we can get out and BR rescued. Make a bridge, climb, jump, swing over the pit of fire ... all that was missing were power pellets and warp zones! Every now and then someone dies. Whoopie! Cross another one off. Who had money on someone panicking in the air shaft? You win! We almost lose haircut boy but to no avail. Jaded gambler guy comes to his rescue  probably only so he can bag his mother if and when they do make it out of there. Finally we lose Kurt Russell who either drowns or his body rejects his face-lift. Can't really tell. Again, don't care. Never did. One more gone. Check! However, he manages to reverse the engines as he breathes his last, thus subjecting us to the rest for a little while longer. Not so long story short, they jam the propellers and climb out to fresh air. And wouldn't you know it? Magically there is a lifeboat just floating there! What?!? What?!? Someone must have entered a cheat code! I'm sorry but this can't be serious!! Why not just have another cruise ship just happen by, scoop them up and they can carry on celebrating the new year? Better yet, how about that alien we mentioned earlier swing by in his UFO and take them back to his planet where they can live forever as gods! Whaaaaaaa????Preposterous! Absurd! Ridiculous!

So why wouldn't this work out? No idea how. But it seems like they actually went out of their way to make this movie bad.I remember when I first saw ""The Poseidon Adventure"", I was biting down my nails hoping that nothing bad happened to the characters. In ""Poseidon"", it seemed like one of those teen slasher movies. You know someone is going to die, but you really don't care who. You just want to get to the crazy death sequences like on a ""Final Destination"" movie. The characters are paper thin and the actors were A list. (Still don't understand.) Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell...they all seemed to be waiting to do their job the whole time. Doesn't make sense to hire actors like this and just make them jump around a capsized ship with no dialogue.Now, don't get me wrong, the scene where the Poseidon actually flips over, that is amazing. Afterwards, I was just waiting for it to end.Also, there really is no awe-inspiring sets. In the original, there was some amount of humor in discovering how everything would look upside down. Like when the kid went to the bathroom and...yeah upside down toilets. Don't look to hard to find anything like that in the remake. You won't find it.This is actually more of a rant than a review.

The special effects are over the top, a few of the lines are cheesy and the hero(s) perform death defying stunts; those would be the same reasons why you see a movie like this in the first place. Decide who you are and then choose accordingly. If you like to be entertained, then I encourage you to go. If, on the other hand, you are better than the rest of us (and are auditioning for a position as a movie critic), stay at home and rent Seven Samurai!",Poseidon
498,acspurs85,Wolfgang's films,7,18 July 2007,"When it comes to Wolfgang Petersen films, I'm as big a fan as they come, especially with the productions of Troy, Air Force One and The Perfect Storm. I was excited to see Poseidon after Troy, because I got obsessed with it. However when I saw the trailers, I was thinking it was not going to be successful (which it was not at the box office, compared to the others) But I just want to point out there is an old saying in Hollywood when it comes to its directors: do one for yourself, do one for the studio. For example, Ron Howard made The Grinch and used that money to film The Da Vinci Code. Now, I don't know if Poseidon is for Petersen or Warners, but it entertained to the end. And you can tell this film was developed strictly to entertain, not win any Oscars, though it could have won for special effects because I think they were brilliant.",Poseidon
499,guydisney,Great Disaster Flick! Overall a Really Good Ride!,8,12 May 2006,"For me to say that a disaster flick is successful, it has to accomplish a few key goals. 1. Have a somewhat plausible plot line. 2. Have a bunch of characters who may or may not survive 3. Have great special effects and a lot of ""OH MY GOD"" moments while being watched. Sometimes its all about the eye-candy.Basically I'm looking for a movie like this to be a roller-coaster ride, a little graphic perhaps, somewhat scary (what if?) and just a fun flick. Not much else than that. I think this movie TOTALLY nails this formula. The biggest complaint I have read about this movie is that the characters aren't developed enough or meaningful. WHATEVER. I don't think you are SUPPOSED to be as attached to these characters as you are to say Jack and Rose from Titanic. Not the same kind of movie.I couldn't help but watch this movie and compare it to Armageddon and The Day After Tomorrow. This may not have had some of the cool sci-fi elements those films did, but I think this movie was a MUCH more satisfying ride then EITHER of those films. (both of which I thought were pretty predictable throughout.)In summary, I think this movie is a great Popcorn flick, far better than Mission Impossible 3 that I saw last weekend, and had some great imagery. It wasn't deep, but I wasn't EXPECTING it to be. I thought it was more graphic than the trailers led me to expect, and I'm almost surprised it didn't get an R rating. Not something I would take young children to AT ALL. A lot of gruesome imagery, but if you are looking for a flick that will make your date cuddle up closer beside you, this is the one to pick.",Poseidon

Why is Kevin Dillon's character a jerk? These tiny questions should have been answered instead of ""leaping off the bow"" into the action smack-packed remake of the classic Poseidon Adventure, called Poseidon. I think Titanic raised the bar on ""Sink or Swim"" film, and this one drops the bar deep. Start with the establishing shot...listen to the score...sound a bit familiar like the Day After Tomorrow? Funny to think, Emmy Rossum is in both. This ensemble cast of old school and new school actors is a good mix, but the movie leaves out the main ingredient...like character development. Why didn't producer Akiva Goldsman (also a screenwriter) see this? We don't care about who lives because the movie is counting on people to have seen the classic and compare, but then again, it kinda doesn't do that either... Which leads me to say that this review may seem as mixed-up as the film. The action was suspenseful at times, and looking at Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell in wet tux shirts was some eye candy for the ladies. But overall, I think Wolfgang Petersen was more interested in the science of the boat than the formula of the film....Guaranteed to have thousands of hours of extras on the DVD.",Poseidon

Poseidon is a breath taking action film that will make you feel dizzy. Full of action from start to end, suffocating scenarios, claustrophobic situations.Of course there are some unnecessary dialogs specially in improper occasions (danger occasions) but, despite those clichés, The Poseidon adventure truly fulfills the expectations and easily reaches its goal, entertain and scare!8/10 In my humble opinion.",Poseidon

Does anyone else feel annoyed that Valentin with all he had done for the rest of the characters was killed off so vicously,is slightly wrongIt also does little for character development.One drunkard,who I felt had to redeem himself was quickly written out of the script.

People are so critical and judgmental over a film, they forget how to enjoy it. Everyone always expects every movie they see to be the #1 Blockbuster ever, and expect everything to totally blow them away, anything less is garbage. I find it selfish and ignorant. I actually find Poseidon to be a great, fun, exciting, suspenseful movie. It really felt like I was on that ship, it was so well done it was scary. The acting was fine, it wasn't top notch Oscar winning, but it worked with the film thats for sure. A movie doesn't have to have memorable quotes to be a great movie.

504,brittson,"Not unsinkable, but no disaster",6,7 October 2013,"The cruise ship, Poseidon, is sailing the ocean blue on New Years' Eve when it's struck by a rogue wave, turning the ship on its back. The wave and the resulting capsize kills most of the crew and passengers and leaves the ship, through still floating while upside down, a deathtrap for those still alive. From a group of survivors, a brave few band together in a desperate race to the top of the bottom of the shipand freedom. A remake of 1972's The Poseidon Adventure, both films are based on a novel by Paul Gallico. The new film is hardly the blockbuster the original film was (through this critic has yet to watch the film), but has been somewhat over-criticized by fellow reviewers. Acting average to somewhat lame? Yeah! Plot holes in the storytelling? Sure. But, with the intense action scenes and reasonable tension that is kept up throughout the film combined with some reasonable acting, the viewer can watch this film and be happy. Don't expect anything Oscar worthy in this film, but be able to forget your problems for about 90 minutes and enjoy. When you are done, you can return to your life. You probably won't remember or care what you saw, but, at least, you won't be hating yourself for watching this film and beating your head against the wall to forget it.

Kurt Russel is one of my favorites and does a fine job as a former fireman, however I'm not to sure about him being the ex-mayor of New York. Josh Lucas is totally believable as a cruise ship gambler/loaner.There was no shortage of set design, with great camera shots that made you feel like this boat was HUGE!

507,icanfly77,The movie is a cliché from start to end,1,6 June 2006,"Warning This contains spoilers:This movie was cheese from beginning to end.You know when you see those specials about Rules for Disaster Movies and how they all follow certain rules..I think this one followed every rule in the book.Characters were one dimensional, they were clichéd - You have someone who is afraid of small spaces and they are going to have to face their fear to survive.You have the single mom and her son which is a pain in the a$$ kid who goes missing - twiceYou have the one that ones to be the leader of the group who funnily enough at the start wants to go it alone You have the father / daughter where the father doesn't trust the daughter and the daughter is trying to be her own woman and in the end the father ends up giving his life up so her daughter can be happy and be with her new fiancé - Where have I seen this before?? Oh thats right - Armageddon. You have the annoying drunk which ends you are supposed to hate so they die so that seems like a just death.Anyways, so the characters are clichéd and so are the circumstances, this movie could have been better if it had more special effects but it only have a small wave. I thought this kind of movie which was clichéd went out in the 70's and 80's, at least disaster movies these days if they follow the clichés do it subtlety, and it also has good special effects to help keep it afloat, this movie was so obvious in its clichés.Also did I miss something - as where did they get the lifeboat and flare gun from in the end?Also some more convenient circumstances - 1) guy goes down to reverse the engines so they can all live and cant find the button is just about to die and with his last dying breath finds and presses the button2) they all escape the ship just as it goes down3) two helicopters appear moments after firing off a flare gunand hows some of the dialogue.. I think it was Richard Dreyfuss who says I'm an architect so I know ships aren't designed to stay afloat upside down.. Since when does it require to be an architect to work this out??This movie was a shame and feels like it jumped right out of the 70's disaster era.

510,gary3414,Where was this suppose to be?,8,16 May 2006,"The first thing I noticed there was no mention of what ocean there were on and where were they were from and where were they going to. However I think you can make some deductions. You saw a full or nearly full moon in the sky when the movie opened before anyone saw the wave and just before the new year started. This full moon didn't seem very high in the sky and was rather low which would make it a summer full moon in the southern hemisphere. Also the water seemed rather warm which would indicate tropical or summertime. There were people swimming in the pool when the wave hit so it seems it was a rather warm night in the summer.In the near future the closest full moon you will get to New Years Day will be January 3, 2007. That full moon will have an unusually high northern declination with the greatest northern declination on January 2of 28 and a half degrees north. The moon will have the greatest range of declination in 2005, 2006, and 2007. This is because of the way the nodes are aligned which give the unusually wide range of declination. The moon will be highest in the sky about two hour before the new year begins and from 32 degrees south will only climb 30 degrees above the horizon. The weather should be quite warm there. By the time the wave arrives which is after midnight the moon is already getting lower which would be correct for the early hours of January 1, 2007. It would set about two hours before sunrise.Spoiler Alert When they jump into the water and onto the red life raft that is just there the moon is out of sky when they fire the flare gun. That would be correct for January 1, 2007, if that is the day were chose by the position of the moon. Two helicopters arrive and shine the spotlight on them and the movie ends before we seem the getting on the helicopter.",Poseidon

512,Wayneinsb,"""Poseidon"" - Great movie with a missed opportunity",8,17 May 2006,"When I first heard back in early 2004 that Wolfgang Petersen was planning a remake of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" I was stoked. The 1972 film holds a special place on my personal favorites list because it was the very first film my parents took me to see (at the local drive-in, no less). But while that film was considered a spectacle in its day (it was the top grossing film of 1973), the visuals have become dated and the performances are now labeled, fairly or unfairly, campy. Still, the Irwin Allen classic has become a guilty pleasure for loyal fans. Over the last several years many of those fans (myself included) have thought that, in the right hands, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from a remake.And in Mr. Petersen the producers found the perfect filmmaker. How could Warner Bros go wrong with the brilliant, visionary director of the claustrophobic classic ""Das Boot"" and the brilliant ""The Perfect Storm?"" Combine the best elements of those two films with the classic tour-De-force survival story originally told by Paul Gallico in his 1969 novel and a new movie could become a critical and box office success.So with much anticipation I headed to see ""Poseidon"" this past weekend. The long awaited remake is a tremendous spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire length of the movie.Petersen begins the film with one of the most stunning opening shots in the history of film: A 3-minute wrap-around of the grand luxury liner as she sails the Atlantic. What makes this scene so amazing is the fact that the ship doesn't really exist. The Poseidon is completely computer generated, yet when you see her up on that screen you can only be in awe. She is majestic and stately - and puts a certain James Cameron luxury liner to shame.We are then introduced to the main characters at a quick clip. Mark Protosevich's screenplay doesn't draw them very well, but I'll speak to that in a moment. Because just as I was starting to let the lack of characterization bother me, the mighty Greek God of the Sea lashes out at our New Years revelers and spins their world upside down in a heart-pounding capsize sequence that bests the original's by a mile.From there it's non-stop, edge-of-your-seat, hair-raising action as our rag tag group of survivors fight their way up the dying ship to find an escape, battling water and obstacles and more water along the way. Petersen's brilliant direction (assisted by Klaus Badelt's nerve-racking score) on three scenes in particular will have you climbing the walls.The first involves a scene in which Richard Dreyfuss' character is faced with one of the most gut-wrenching decisions a human being would ever have to make. I could feel the audience collectively asking themselves ""God! What would I do?"" The second involves the group's ascent through an air vent. The claustrophobia in this scene is so intense if you're not climbing the walls then you need to have your head examined. The third involves a mother (played by Jacinda Barrett) and her son (Jimmy Bennett) and the rising waters. Mothers will be ready to pull their hair out during this segment.All of the action sequences are well done, but those three, spaced through out the movie, will leave you feeling exhausted...in a good way...as if it the cost of the ticket was money well spent.As with most well done disaster movies it's the action sequences and special effects that save ""Poseidon."" I recommend the movie highly and think that on my list of ""popcorn flicks"" this will join the original near the top. That is thanks in large part to Petersen, his computer and design crews, and a cast that did the best they could with the script they got.And it is that script where I find my sole disappointment. Why Warner Bros moved ahead with such a lackluster screenplay puzzles me. This had the chance to be a classic sea tale. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting ""Moby Dick,"" but Paul Gallico's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" is the consummate story of survival at sea. It is deep in character study; human nature complete with all of its flaws. It is dark and psychological and leaves the reader breathless.Unfortunately none of that transferred over in the 1972 film. When I read that Wolfgang Petersen would be at the helm of this new version I had high hopes that the dramatic human stories told in the Gallico novel would finally be told on the big screen. But it doesn't happen.Roger Ebert opined that he felt Petersen's heart wasn't in this film. I don't think that was it. To me it almost seems like Warner Bros wanted ""Poseidon"" in the can sooner rather than later and were willing to sacrifice a strong story in order to get the film on screens by May 12. As a result the film is awkwardly edited at times  as if there had been a script there, but that it was jettisoned and then a hasty editing job done to plug the holes. It makes me wonder whether they purposefully threw away a potentially triumphant story for yet another piece of popcorn fluff.At this point it doesn't really matter, because the film is popcorn fluff. Mind you, it is well done, exciting, and thrilling popcorn fluff and I highly suggest you head to the theater and give it a look. But, I just can't help but wonder ""what if?"" I'm afraid we'll never know, because it is highly doubtful that this story will be told again.",Poseidon

The theater was packed, which surprised me since this looked like a hokey knock off to me. I can tell you, once the drama starts it literally never stops! It went from one tense moment to another.

Unfortunately when you're not the Executive Producer and you don't have the say so of leaving in almost 30 minutes of film.............you end up with THIS.If I was going to take the time to write a letter to the Hollywood Producers of this remake debacle it might be along the lines of this:Dear Mr./s Clueless,If your going to remake a Movie Epic which essentially was the Iconic Disaster Film for which every disaster film was modeled after since 1972, here's an idea, make it as good or better. So by completely changing the story line (other then flipping the Ship upside down), that's a story for success? Maybe by putting in the new Karate Kid and Mr. Miyagi that'd flared up the dramatic ""how do we overcome"" sequences. OK, I'll bite. You changed 99.9% of the characters and story line to put in incredible CGI effects, but overturned the Ship in 2 Minutes? What a build up. Then you ripped out almost 30 minutes of the film for release. I felt as though I was watching ""Easy Rider"", ""The Wall"", and ""Fantasia"" all combined. What a scrambled egg mess.Was there flaws in the 1972 Poseidon? Absolutely. However, the acting was dramatically better, the action more intense and in the last scene as the torch cuts through stern sums up the 1972 movies intensity. The look on the characters faces says it all. They're obviously reflecting on their loss not their gain. You missed all of that completely in 2006 version.",Poseidon

But then when you think about it they all go to heaven in a new Poseidon. Rouge waves are real they are just very rare. People should design ships that flip right-side-up.

Watching the main characters stumble through a variety of obstacles and manage to get through each one with relative Ease.The relationships between each of the characters were fuzzy and indefinable.

517,kraiden3,"The most ""Entertaining"" movie I have seen this year",6,13 May 2006,"I cant give this movie a bad review. How can you? Thihnk of why 90% of the nation will go to see a movie. Its because they consider it to be entertainment, and thats just what the movie Poseidon will do for the viewer. Posiden will stat off showing the outlines and weak character dev of the main characters, and then catapults you on a room by room thrill ride like I have not seen in years. Remember all those times where you read a review about a movie and the critic was quoted as saying ""non stop heart pounding excitement"" yet you never noticed it? Well thats because at film school they teach you to have action, cool down, plot, then action, this movie pretty much ignores that standard model. I felt fatigued at the end of the movie because of this format however. I can see why the movie is an 1hr 30 min. The movie will not win any awards however. Very poor character dev, and nothing really over the top cinematography will put a halt to that. Most every scene is a near death situation, with the main characters barely escaping. After you get into a flow of ""ok they will barely escape every scene"" they throw you a curve-ball and kill off one of the characters. While my co reviewer wanted to say the lack of character development was a bad thing (you cant feel sorry for a character dying you don't know) I felt it was the best idea of all because other than the Rogue charming leader main character type and the little boy whom you cant kill off for it being too morbid... ALL of the main characters where fair game. To me it was like watching Scream only the villain was the boat.I have not had this much ""FUN"" watching a movie since ""Serenity"", and though that was a superior movie overall, I believe this was more ""exciting"". Posiden is worth the price of admission, but is far from something that is a classic. I would recommend it highly and implore anyone to go see it, but would laugh at anyone who bought it on DVD or nominated it for any awards. I am a harsh judge so I have to give all movies a 5 and above average movies a 6 no movie is a 10.

Brilliant sets and stunning special effects. The only thing that lets this film down is the lack of character development. Not sure if its better than the original. Nice appearance of Fergie from BEP also. The characters have all changed from the original. In a way this could follow other peoples attempts to escape as in a parallel movie however this is not the case. A good hour and a half of entertainment but it just could have been longer with scenes before the ship turns over, which happens after about 15mins. A half an hour intro would have been good to help with the character development. That is the only thing i didn't like about this film was the lack of character Development.

The special effects made this movie twice as good, and the first shot in the movie showing you the whole boat was awe-inspiring. Fergie's two songs ""Bailamos"" and ""Won't Let You Fall"" deserve to win an Oscar, and they surpass ""The Morning After"" song by quite a lot. They make the movie as realistic as this theme could be, and you end up sitting on the edge of your seat at the end of the movie.

Come to think of it that guy falling through the skylight in the original is still pretty doggone impressive even if it was the result of old technology. I liked Kurt Russell as the ex mayor.In his finest performance since ""What About Bob?"" Richard Dreyfus is convincing as a suicidal guy who seems to prefer inside-the-ship drowning to the traditional jumping off the rail.Its hard not to compare the old with the new version of this film. If you are like me and have a short attention span you will appreciate the absence of lengthy, why are we here?, if a tree falls in the forest..what is the meaning of life?,reflective, dialogue that was so much a part of the Posieden Adventure. This film ranks right up there with The Fugitive for non stop action. But having said that I missed the innocence and quaintness of the Poseiden Adventure. I missed the intensity of Gene Hackman passionately preaching that if they will only believe he will lead them to the sign that reads ""Capsize Emergency Exit"". I missed Shelly Winters heroic New York City swimming championship sequence. I missed ex cop Ernest Borgnine...and who can ever forget the presence of mind of Captain Leslie Neilson in wishing everyone on the bridge Happy New Year with the wave bearing down on them...also the climbing up the Christmas tree to get to the bottom of things. I even missed Red Buttons vitamin supplements.All in all Poseiden was good entertainment and I was not disappointed with the movie.",Poseidon
524,heathnothomo1177,Ship Disaster Lacks Character and Conflict,5,12 May 2006,"Poseidon quickly sinks, with relatively stale characters and effects and without the only thing that made the original 1972 disaster movie The Poseidon Adventure worth passing the time: a sense of moral conflict.Logistically, how passengers interact with a capsized ship's mechanics is remotely interesting and the story tracks closely to Irwin Allen's picture. But Poseidon, steering clear of anything like Gene Hackman's God-doubting minister, presents its passengers in fits and starts. It never stabilizes.Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the opening shot closes in on a streamlined, hi-tech cruiser in classic Cunard red and black, evoking the Queen Mary, cutting through the vast ocean. The voyage to the bottom of the sea is already in progress. Picking up on passenger Josh Lucas jogging on deck is a signal that it centers on one major character.But the characters are slight, and per-passenger introductions are awfully thin. We meet oily Lucas, a gambler badly in need of a razor blade, and while it's clear the cad will turn herohe does so in a bold divehe comes off too shady to lead an expedition.It doesn't help that Kurt Russell as an ex-mayor, ex-fireman and fatherto wide-eyed Emmy Rossumoutclasses Lucas in every situation, making a person out of a piece of cardboard in the only character worth rooting for. Mr. Russell, looking fit and civilized as always, almost single-handedly elevates the movie.But not quite. After a rogue wave slams into the ocean liner on New Year's Eve where it's been, where it is located, and where it's going are mysteriesthe ship is swept upside down and the passengers' boring ascent, led by Lucas, begins.The action is predictably fiery, wet and loud, with fireballs raging and bodies floating everywhere. The oncoming wave is a realistically ominous wall of water. The people on the boat in its way are another story. A single mother and her son are straight out of The Love Boat, which had better writers, and the rest of thema Spanish-speaking stowaway, a gay architect, young lovers, a waiter and a male chauvinistare lifeless long before the wave crashes.None are memorable, even if compared to the preachy captain played by Andre Braugher, looking lost, and his girlfriend Passengers crawl, swim and bond, with spotty success. Dodging danger and relying on Lucas as the leaderfireman Russell and architect Richard Dreyfuss are rarely if ever consulted for their knowledgethey die one by one with no particular point, which echoes the movie's basic idea that life is a crapshoot.Besides Kurt Russell, Rossum takes her best aim as his young daughter, secretly engaged to her boyfriend, who looks like the kid from the Dell Computers commercial. That, unfortunately, is as deep as it goes, in what could have been a guiltless summer survival story that instead swirls slowly down the drain.",Poseidon

We went to go find our seats, and there was a total of ten people in the theater, including me and my friend. The effects were sometimes cheesy, and it didn't have a very strong beginning, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed the movie. The action sequences were pretty good too, which is impressive because it didn't come off as too overly-done or poorly coordinated. I didn't know Josh Lucas was a good actor either. I'd only seen him in A Beautiful Mind, and he didn't get a lot of screen time in that movie. Anyway, in my opinion, it was a great movie. I'm glad I was in an open mind-set when I saw Poseidon.

My daughter and I were amazed at the effects. The disaster sequence alone is worth the price of admission. The accuracy of the problems facing the crew and passengers is exceptional. If you have seen DAS BOOT, especially the original German TV version, and THE PERFECT STORM, you know what Petersen can go with the sea as enemy. He does it beautifully here, in a place where, again, nature is the enemy, not some political force. Even the aging Kurt Russell gets off some good lines. I don't go to a disaster film or sf film for character development. I go for the excitement of the story. And this one, although familiar, is still gripping.

Yes, the characters were better and we cared more about them than in the remake. No, it didn't need remaking but here it is.Digital effects have progressed quite a bit since Titanic and the ship, particularly at the start of the movie, it is magnificent. They don't spend much time on developing the characters, but the movie takes off with a bang. The director never lets up, its a roller coaster. No its not high drama, but neither was the original. I looked up Roger Ebert's review from 1972 and he gave the original only 2 and half stars; this one he gives 2. It wasn't intended to be a great film, it was and is a disaster movie.I think we care more about the original because we have seen it so many times and those actors were A listers even then. And we carry the works they did since into that film in our minds. The lack of A listers (other than Dreyfuss, who was very good in all of his scenes) helped this movie. Kurt Russell is solid and stoic. Josh Lucas did a fine job. I wish I had cared more about them but that didn't make me dislike the movie. It was paying tribute to a B movie that we made an A. In a world of remakes like Starsky and Hutch (hated it); Dukes of Hazzard (eh, okay) and Bewitched (I won't even bother to watch it) this one is about the best of that genre. I agree, Hollywood needs some new ideas and needs to stop messing with our memories. But they will continue to do it and we can't stop it.Go see it and just enjoy it.

The characters were believable, but I agree with some people that the character back stories were fleeting BUT I think that added to the movie, it made the pace a lot faster and kept the suspense much higher. I loved the original movie, but this was 1000 times better, I can't wait for the DVD so I can see it again and again. Go see it for yourself, it's well worth the ticket price.

533,spud1957,Too short,8,12 May 2006,I saw the movie at the 10:00 PM showing and was very surprised at how short and incomplete it felt. I really enjoyed it but it seemed like they cut out a great deal to get a shorter time .The wave strikes almost in the first 10 minutes with no development of the people or ship. I wanted to see what the ship would have looked like before the wave like they showed in Titanic. The sets were first rate and the special effects were worth the ticket price but turn your brain off and enjoy. I hope they get back to the movies that developed people so you cared who lived or died. I hope with the DVD era that they will come out with the version it should have been with maybe 2 1/2 hours like Das Boat.,Poseidon

Josh Lucas did a great job and reminded me of a younger Paul Newman and Kurt Russell just keeps on going (after all, he did kill ""The Thing"" right?). It did go a little ""overboard"" with all the dead bodies but then again, how many staff does it take to run a cruise ship, over a 1,000? so I guess there would be quit a few casualties that you didn't see in the 1972 version. The sets where amazing and non-cgi. How many gallons of water can you pump onto a movie set? Dang, I really enjoyed the ride!",Poseidon
535,davion00,I liked it,7,9 May 2006,"I liked this movie, for pure entertainment value. Too often people seem to think every movie and every scene should contain something new and innovative, when in fact a movie can do well with old ideas in new terms. Not everything has to be Oscar material to be good, in fact i prefer movies like this over 99% of the ones that win Oscars.I go to a movie to escape from reality, to be somewhere that I can not be, Poseidon did that for me, as have many movies like it.I thought this was a very intense movie, I loved the original, but this version by far was more frightening, thanks to current movie Tech/fx. And the fact directors are not scared to show graphic and overwhelming death scenes that never would of made it passed censors in the 70s.on a side note:ignore most of the ""factual"" comments made by Holygabriel, most were inaccurate.the life boat was there moments after the big catastrophe hit the boat, the 2nd hispanic to die, wasn't electrocuted, and Richard's character made it very obvious that he didn't have a ""wife"" but a ""he"" partner.in a disaster flick, full blown character creation is not always needed, the disaster is the main character, the other players are just supporting roles.",Poseidon

Well, I came away flooded by the special effects but realizing that I did not care about any one actor who survived, let alone the hundreds who perished, because no effort is made to provide any of them with a personality.Sure, the plot is absurd but that is to be expected and forgiven in these disaster movies. But with all those millions spent, wouldn't you think a viewer would care about a single character?Not only is there no identifiable personality in the movie but the relationships between them are non-existent. Let's see: the father thinks his grownup daughter and her boyfriend may be having sex and the daughter says her dad is being condescending. The young couple are in love. Another woman, absent any personality, has a nondescript child The old guy in the group is despondent but we do not care as we do not know anything about him other than he says he is jilted. A cute stowaway is...a cute stowaway. The lead was in the Navy and says he is a professional gambler.

Instead, Poseidon is at best an insult to the original. It will definitely not be remembered with the same fondness as either of the aforementioned films.I must have managed a stern countenance when Dylan Johns (played by Josh Lucas) suggested the existence of propeller tubes at the bow of Poseidon. Perhaps when a ship is capsized, all reference points are reversed?Well, Poseidon is the god of the sea.

539,zeros_and_ones,"""Poseidon"" is all wet",2,11 May 2006,"Not a good movie. Not even a good Special FX action movie. FX wise, interiors of the ship are done fairly well, with quite realistic (I imagine) destruction and damage, but the external shots especially during the initial sinking are really lame - nowhere near the level of Titanic. Acting is generally poor, with Richard Dreyfus as the lone standout giving a decent performance. The characters frequently engage in silly, trite banter pre-crisis, but it only continues after everyone is thrown in a life and death struggle. The father-daughter relationship (Kurt Russel-Emmy Rossum) is so poorly done it's painful to watch. Josh Lucas' character is supposed to come off as the ""me first"" roguish guy who learns to care for the others, but the development is so amateurish we can see it coming a mile off. I had nothing invested in any of the characters, except Andre Braugher, and his role is unfortunately very small. P.S. Either it seemed to me that Warner Bros was prepping Fergie (of the Black Eyed Peas) for a solo career because she was given a ridiculous amount of screen time for her talent/contribution to the story.",Poseidon

I laughed through most of the movie because of its unrealistic appeal. If you want to go see a ship get turned over and watch things blow up..then knock yourself out, otherwise, stay at home and watch ""The Poseidon Adventure"". At least with the original, there is quality acting and an attempt to create realism in a story where the actual events are unlikely to take place. To me, this was a much cheaper version of the Titantic..not only because of the setting, believe it or not but there is similar conflict with actors and then also a twist of Armageddon thrown in.",Poseidon

Simply put: ""Poseidon"" is all that ""Titanic"" was; minus the time consuming and unnecessary love story and then some. I felt like a little 5 year old in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory; for those of you like me that get off on high budget effects and CGI, Poseidon delivers the goods. I don't anticipate any Oscars for acting; but Dryfeus, Russell, and the rest of ""escape or die"" entourage deliver solid performances. As for the storyline, it's almost so simple that it can't be critiqued. Even if you haven't seen the original; a 30 second television trailer is sufficient. Comparing the old and new; they are as similar and they are different. The mega scale action sequences seemed to me that most different of all.

The majority of the movie was about a small group of people and how they (well some of them) survived after the ship capsized. There was not much blood or violent deaths. I was very satisfied. However, I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to everyone else on the ship and also the ship turned over so quickly and it wasn't exciting enough.

If the writers had developed the characters more we would have been more drawn to the storyline. Also too much time was spent crawling in the vents!

Back when the original Posiedon movie was shown, there was no internet, no one had home computers, no cells phones and no cells phones to surf the net with. Talk about impatience, can't we wait to get home to surf the net. I just think that the director knew today's audience that would go to see this movie did not have the patience to sit through any character development and got to the action as quickly as he could. We reap what we sow.The special effects were good and most of the action scenes were ""on the edge of your seat"" intense.The thing that really spoiled the movie for me was the ending. ***HERE'S THE SPOILER****.

Like in most escape movies, the group of passengers in Poseidon includes the cliché coward who is out to save himself at all costs but, fortunately for him, he dies early in the escape and avoids the rest of the movie. Conveniently, even though the ship is upside-down and flooding, much of the ship's lighting and electrical systems stay on.Stacy Ferguson (Fergie)from the Black Eyed Peas plays the singer in the band on the ship.

Character development to me is very important, but more movies today are using their time for character development as uninteresting fluff. If you can't do proper character development, don't waste my time with it at all. Maybe the makers Poseidon realized that and stuck with what they knew was the main draw of the movie, action. I was on the edge of my seat for pretty much the entire movie, much more than I can say for MI:III.

Director Wolfgang Petersen has hired a talented cast of Actors - Josh Lucas (A Brilliant Mind, The Deep End); Kurt Russell (Deep Blue, Silkwood) - not to mention the utterly wasted brilliance of Richard Dreyfuss & Andre Braugher - and has given them nothing of substance to say or do. It is possibly Hollywood's first ""virtual script"" ever written - if, indeed a final draft was actually completed. There is truly not one character worthy of the audience's empathy. Ironically, one of shortest lived roles, a Rat-Packesque gambler (played by Kevin Dillon) is the sole character to have any, well - ""character"". Lucas & Russell, with the exception of the age difference, and varying shades of blue eyes, are basically interchangeable as the film's two heroes; the three female characters look so similar, as to be literally indistinguishable. One of the women (Mia Maestro giving it her best) is a stowaway, yet she is wearing what seems to be an outfit worth the equivalent of a ""first-class"" fare. There is virtually no ""conflict"" between the characters. In one quieter moment, Emmy Rossum (Russell's daughter in the film) and her fiancé (Mike Vogel) are embarking on a prolonged, tearful separation, it's hard to discern if Russell's dive into the water is in order to ""save the day"" or simply commit suicide out of sheer boredom. The action sequences, while being visually realistic & elaborate, are repetitive and shot in too many close-ups. There is no ""big"" to this Poseidon ""adventure"". How many water-spurting manholes can a movie take? One can only imagine what Titanic's James Cameron would have done with this soulless re-bake. He's a smart man - he just wouldn't do it!. While Cameron is a director who can weave story, character & effects in an organic and seamless fashion, you wonder if this film's director isn't just a playing with his ""rubber ducky"" in a bathtub.

They even had actors create a couple of interesting characters but then gave them no opportunity to fly. Some of the effects were exciting to watch, which is where my 2 rating comes from. But oh so predictable. If you pay to see this on the big screen for the special effects, go on discount night! Bring New Years Eve horns to blow every time a laughable scene plays.",Poseidon
556,habies98911,Character confusion,5,17 May 2006,All the women characters were clones of one another. When swimming around couldn't tell who was who. They should of made one a blonde another a red head or something distinguishing. I thinks they all wore black dresses as well. Very confusing!Could of substituted an elderly actress along the lines to match thatmemorable Shelly Winters.Overall how many times can you swim down through an open hole to the other side and keep an audience in suspense.I'll admit the special effects were good but Titanic was the originator of them.,Poseidon
557,KFiNLF,I wish I was on the boat and NOT in the theater.,3,18 May 2006,"Just one question regarding (insert any part of the movie here).... Why? It was nice to see Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfus again (and I hope that was all they were expecting from making this movie was to be seen on the big screen again). Are they strapped for cash or something? *(semi-spoiler)* Also great to see Kevin Dillon and Freddy Rodriguez get some movie time *(limited unnecessarily as they were)*. But the only character that I remotely cared about making it off the ship was the kid and that was just about the only reason why, he was a kid. This will make a great new attraction at Universal Studios, it can go right in between Waterworld and Backdraft. I think they used pretty much the same special effects as Backdraft, but with a bit more of Waterworlds water. Pretty much everything (acting, story, songs, effects, etc.) was forgettable, not forgivable. No animals were harmed in the making of this film, *(again, semi-spoiler) but a few select minorities were (not all, I mean thankfully there was a suicidal white gay character who lived (again, why?)). Don't get me wrong I'm proud myself, but... Okay, second question... Why didn't I just stay home?",Poseidon
558,lostnblownaway,Best movie in theaters for awhile!,10,20 May 2006,"I found that Poseidon was extremely intense. Making ""The Day After Tomorrow"" look like a fairy tale, Poseidon showed how 8 people choosing to go against the flow can turn out to become the only left survivors, or at least most of them. There are disturbing images(even I had to close my eyes), I felt emotionally captured by each individual's quest to escape the sinking ship. There was a constant life or death decision to make in almost every scene, it kept me on my toes! Dylan Johns(Josh Lucas), a professional gambler leads the group in the most terrifying excursions toward the bottom of the ship-which now is above the surface of the water.

It was a crazy wild ride with anticipation around every corner. This movie far exceeded my expectations. I was hoping that it would keep true to the original. It paralleled the original in a unique way but also had so many differences that every corner had an unexpected twist. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. I want to see it again right now! I would recommend this movie to everyone-especially those who remember and love the original. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years. A+++ My faith is restored in Hollywood!!!!

My one question throughout the entire movie was, ""what are they gonna do when they get out of the boat, where the hell are they gonna go?"". When we finally got to that point the movie just ended. It was so horrible! Don't waste your money on another plot less film. It was okay, lots of action but no purpose. I felt so much could be done with the movie that wasn't.

Hasn't anybody notices that the only people that die are the immigrants? (oh yeah and the bad guy that nobody likes, of course...) At least the gay guy survives, seems that we might be getting somewhere in the minorities killing in the Hollywood productionsThe final choice between father(Russel)vs future husband (Vogel) is expected since the very first scene in the cabin. The visual effects were terrible, was the sinking of the boat done in a kitchen tub? The scrip was not a masterpiece either, but I wasn't expecting it to be so at this point I wasn't disappointed.

I saw the original Poseiden Adventure for the first time when I was young, and then again a few more times because my whole family really likes the movie. The long and short of it is the movie was excellent, as well as the graphics and the acting. Richard Dreyfus gives a breath taking performance! Kurt Russell and Emmy Rossum have a very true to life relationship as father and daughter. I also really enjoyed seeing newcomer Mia Maestro (who played Nadia on ABC's Alias). I liked the way the movie stayed true to the story, but tweaked the characters and the people to make it more modern. All in all, I give this movie a 10! SEE IT!",Poseidon

My entire family enjoyed it, even my ten year kid who wanted to see scary movie 4. There was action, suspense, drama everything you are looking for in a good movie. After watching the the new version of poseidon, I decided to rent the original version with Gene Hackman and crew, I fell asleep within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The new version is better, believe me you won't be disappointed. Kurt Russel is one of my favorites, he still has it. John Lucas was incredible, a resentless hero who had a never die attitude. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, I was afraid to go the men's room didn't want to miss any action.",Poseidon
566,commurin,another awful cover,1,26 May 2006,"However i've only seen the trailer, i can say this. How come people in recent spectacle/action movies aren't older than 40. Remember the old couple that dies in the original, what a drama. Nowadays supermodels and money shoving kids go on a cruise like they inherited millions and are living it up. I suppose in the older days the wages of the actors were closer to each other and less of a factor in the budget, so they could afford lots of background people. The director could pick some unknown actor and let him act, instead of the need of a blockbuster actor (with the same age of the capital spending focus-group)that can guarantee the money return in the cash-register. I also suppose that the blue/green screen acting asks to much of an actor. The movie lacks the depth of story and acting. I hope Wolfgang Petersen kicks the bucket before he's tempted to cover his own Das Boot.",Poseidon
567,charmichelle8026,Titanic? Try Armaggedon...,7,29 May 2006,"If you choose to take this as a ship-disaster movie of Titantic's grandeur and value, then obviously you will be disappointed. But as an action-packed summer blockbuster, it holds its own quite nicely. This was not written to be an in-depth character analysis with Oscar-winning performances. The plot is feasible at best, but it wasn't written to win any awards.So, how is this movie worthwhile? While the script clearly lacked any kind of believable dialogue, the characters were still likable and entertaining. Emmy Rossum, usually one of my favorites, was disappointing as a petulant, love-sick adolescent. However, her fiancée (Mike Vogel) was surprisingly charming. He is attractive, delivers his corny one-liners with a minimal amount of cheese, and is no more heroic than is necessary. Of all the generic, blonde, twenty-somethings they could have cast, I'm very pleased they decided on Mike Vogel.Also, Josh Lucas deserve a tiny pat on the back. I've heard multiple reviewers call him a Matthew McConaghy wanna-be. This is unfair, he is a little less attractive but a little more likable. He was a perfectly acceptable choice for the ""reluctant hero"" role. Kurt Russell, while not among my favorite actors, played an aging hero who must let go of 1)His daughter, and 2)His youthful heroism. Once again, like Lucas, he is acceptable but not outstanding.The truly exceptional parts of this movie were the special effects. The amazing water sequences, fires, explosions, crashes, etc. are what kept me on the edge of my seat. If you want to compare Poseidon to another movie, I'd recommend Armageddon. Its a summer blockbuster with mediocre acting but some delightfully outlandish action. It also ends on an Armageddon-like note, where you'll suddenly wonder:""Bruce, Liv, Ben- how long have you been standing there?"" If you're not expecting Titantic, you'll walk away from Poseidon with white knuckles and a pleasantly surprised smile on your face.",Poseidon

It had one or two funny parts, but it's the action that get you. I had trouble blinking, because I didn't want to miss anything. This movie is flawless. I actually wanted their to be more levels on the ship so that they had farther to go. The biggest thing is all the twists and turns in the story. Yes, you know the main story, ship sinks, people try to get out, but their is more than that. You get to know quite a few characters, and you hope that most of them make it. I will tell you, that TONS of people die, but I won't say who! Go see it, It's great!!!",Poseidon
569,camicii,A character driven movie...,8,29 May 2006,"Poseidon's main theme in my opinion is what people do in times of crisis. the movie starts out by viewing the enormous ship and introduces the characters. its a very fast passed movie, within about 20 minutes of the movie the wave hits, and yes, the bodies pile up very fast. i like Poseidon because the actors did well, the characters seemed real, and it was very fast passed. this is not a re-make of titanic, although there are several love arcs, the movie is to fast passed to get into to much details. the special effects are alright, they are not the best, but when the wave hits, there is so much going on you don't really have time to be critical of the special effects. this movie is only about 1hour 40 minutes (roughly) and in my opinion its definitely worth the time and money to go see.",Poseidon
570,munited2,Something's wrong with the picture.....,6,7 June 2006,"I have a question...... in the movie, the ship was designed to stay afloat upside-down. Some parts of the movie shows the group of people frantically trying to get out and some parts as the camera zooms out to the exterior of the ship where you see the ship upside-down. The question is, shouldn't the people be standing on the ceiling of the ship instead? It would be harder to get out if your'e upside-down inside a ship as opening doors would be the opposite way, climbing stairs would be impossible and people would be stepping on lights. Well I guess the show was trying to make it easy for the audience to understand and watch the show comfortably without getting confused by watching everything upside-down......but just think about it, it would certainly be much more difficult to manoeuvre your way out of an upside-down sinking ship....don't you think so? hmmmm.....",Poseidon

I'm not a die hard fan of the original however compared to this effort the first one is legendary! I really do despair at Hollywood for making some disastrous re-makes of great films that really should be left alone. From the word go, this film is dull, unimaginative, ridiculous and don't even get me started on the awful CGI. The characters were very contrived and you couldn't really feel empathy for any of them, except maybe the stowaway Spanish girl. The rest were a waste of time. I wasn't particularly impressed by the acting abilities either, but I guess they did the best with what they were given. The story didn't have a beginning it just started and then 'bang' the terrible CGI wave appeared. You didn't know where they were, who they were, what kind of people they were, except maybe for the character played by Kevin Dillon in a 'pantomime villain' method actor way.

I thought that the film did not have a good plot or structure at all. The characters were not developed, i have no idea what the background of the characters are to know where they were coming from.Why was there even a little kid and that old man there anyway? They just got in the way of making a possible good film. The movie was just a rip off of the Titanic. Even though there were no real romances, there were basically similar characters and there was no real build up of plot. If a 'climax graph' were to be drawn, THERE WOULD BE NO CLIMAX...it would just be a series of speed bumps and a really short boring happy ending.Some serious parts of the movie made me laugh.

The non stop action from one scene to the next makes this movie great.It grips you from the very beginning till the end.The visuals are brilliantly done.l actually like the fact that it was shot upside down, adds more thrill when those struggling to survive actually have to get out through the bottom of the ship which is a mission considering the confusion of moving from top to bottom of a ship in the upward direction.Though quite predictable it still lives to its expectations.He did justice to the book!l think more emotional connections between the survivors before the strike by the rogue tidal wave would have made it even more intense.he managed to keep it from being another Titanic wannabe.Actually read that Josh almost drowned during the filming, not surprised with all those underwater scenes.Fergie's songs are also very cool!!",Poseidon
574,m_kokholm,If you know something about ships do not see this movie,3,28 June 2006,After having seen the movie I was deeply disappointed. If you know just a little bit about ships there will be so many faults in the movie that you won't even bother too tell all of them. Take the bow-thrusters for example. When bow-thruster are turned on they rotate with a constant speed. When the direction is turned it will not stop at turn the other way around. Instead it will turn the blades. Another thing about the bow-thrusters are that they will not start sucking instead of blowing into the hole if the rotation direction is turned. I'm a bit irritated of having use that many money to see a movie with that many faults. Unfortunately. It does still have at couple of good scenes.,Poseidon

From a marine engineer's point of view....Apparently when a cruise ship flips over the lights stay on for a few hours, the bow thrusters suddenly come on and begin operating at about 500 RPM, explosions occur randomly...underwater, and people can easily walk through the ballast tanks and operate them while inside the tanks and pump the water (from the sea chest which is now in the air) I guess what I should have said is, AMAZING MOVIE!!?",Poseidon
576,meaganhenderson,The Science behind the movie,8,8 February 2020,"Poseidon is a movie about a cruise ship that gets hit from the side by a rogue wave on New Year's and completely capsizes. The main characters consist of a suicidal architect who suddenly decides he doesn't want to die, an old fireman/mayor who is rich, his daughter and her fiancée, an illegal stowaway, a socialite and her son, and a guy who knows a lot about ships and swindling people out of their money who works better alone. Together these people manage to be the only survivors of this tragic occurrence. They face many obstacles on their way to the bottom, which is now the top, of the ship to escape.
Rogue waves are waves that are formed from the buildup of energy in the water after a storm, these waves then will intersect with other waves and cause one massive wave to be formed. In the movie, they did mention what it was when they first were capsized by the wave, but in reality the rogue wave would be smaller than the wave that hit the Poseidon, not by much, but out in the middle of the ocean a rogue wave wouldn't have that much momentum and velocity to get as large as it did, especially on a clear night, with no hint of a storm.
What the group of people did in the movie in the situation they were in, ended up working out in their favor for most of them, but in reality, most people would have listened to the captain on what they should do. In this case, what they did was the better move, but there is a very small group of people who would just decide to try and find their own way out, let alone a group of strangers. In this case listening to the captain wasn't the right move, but if people were actually in that situation they would have stayed in the ballroom. There were also some inconsistencies with some of the things they did when they were working on getting to the top/bottom of the ship. The time they held their breath for, especially the child just doesn't seem plausible. There's also the fact that the main kid was the only kid on the ship, I did not see one other kid that entire time, dead or alive. And then when the ship flipped, there's no way that while everyone was holding onto things and losing their grip, that the kid was strong enough to hold onto the piano the whole time. Also why was Eliana the only one to really be panicking about some of the stuff they were doing, she had the most realistic reactions out of all of them, including the kid. Also how was there conveniently a life raft floating right outside where they exited the ship.",Poseidon

Anyone who says that just doesn't know what they are talking about. I suggest any of you that are reading these comments of people saying it's a horrible movie, you better go see it for yourself, before you believe all of this. If you don't like it, then you don't like it, but I can't understand why anyone wouldn't like it, it's a great movie.

It just makes no sense at all and what kind of mother in that situation would take her eyes off her kid??? yes i know its just a movie and i can't help but wonder if some scenes were cut out of the DVD release. The European DVD of poseidon clocks in at around 87 minutes. Is there an extended cut planned or have europe been screwed over again by another shoddy DVD release?

I enjoyed the original movie as well, but this one is more for my generation. Watching the original seems a bit dated, compared to the movies I've grew up watching.

All we are really seeing is some decent work by the tech crew. The script was awful, the acting was bridled at best, and the characters were forgettable. Why did Kurt Russell quit as mayor? Why does Jen try to protect her dad? What is the purpose of having Richard Dreyfuss follow along? We need answers to questions brought up in dialogue. This makes the story personal. Also, basic acting 101 tells you that actors need objectives. OK, survive can be an objective, but seriously, to make a movie interesting we need some personal drama. Save your time and money and see anything else. At least Plan 9 From Outer Space is laughable in a cult way. This is beyond awful.

590,davidburrell,"Nice video, but little story.",4,3 December 2006,"If you wish to see an entertaining movie that you can become involved in, because of the people and their struggles to escape a disaster at sea, then watch the 1972 version of this offering.But, if the only thing that is important to you is special effects showing explosions, fire, and a lot of water, then this one is for you. Of course, if the stories are true about $140-$150 million being blown to make this movie, then my only comment about that is, maybe, about $100 million ended up in someone's private Swiss bank account.It appears as though no money was spent on a screen writer, or character or story development. Special effects are great, but the movie failed for me, because after the first 10-15 minutes, I didn't care about most of the people, and in a couple of cases, wished that two would die quickly because of the insanity of the parts they were playing and overacting in.The film has some very good actors in it, but even well known stars, and some, not so well known, can't even begin to deliver a performance without some type of a plot to follow, and good lines to say. Special effects alone can't carry a movie. I didn't care that the people, this time, weren't the same as the ones in the 1972 version. I also didn't care that the story was changed.I did care that there seems to be no story, just special effects. Kind of like playing a shoot-em-up video game. I don't care about all of the monsters and creatures I blow away in a video game. But, I do like to care about and become involved in the problems the people in a story are having.What little story that did appear, from time to time, made no sense. I won't even start to list all of the errors made in this film. I'll start with the first, and end with the last though.One, a new modern ship, with all of its electronics, can't see a 90 feet high wave that is bearing down on it? Last, in the final scene, after the ship sinks, only one large bit of debris is floating on the ocean, and that so happens to be a large, round, life raft? This movie was about 30 minutes shorter than the first one, cost ten to fifteen times as much to make, and had one tenth the impact and entertainment value, if that.",Poseidon
591,mltfin,A very bad movie,1,11 December 2006,"Simply horrible! I don't even know where to start. The story was weak, a very basic ""problem after a problem adventure movie"". I did not get any feel for the characters in the movie and all the dialogs were out of place and clichéd.The effects were OK but I have to wonder what's with the explosions, why does every movie have to have thousands of things exploding and a wall of fire closing down from behind. This movie is another good example that you cant make a movie based on effects, you kinda need a story as well.I cant think of anything good about this movie and so cant recommend this movie to anyone.",Poseidon
592,shlarbunny,nostalgia boosted this to an 8 for me,8,5 July 2021,"Poseidon is a movie that I always absolutely loved as a child. When I was trying to choose a disaster film to review for class it was really hard because these types of movies have always been huge for me (I love so many of them!). I finally settled on Poseidon because it had been the longest since I had seen it last, and it is always great to watch a movie with fresh eyes. Never fails that I notice something new. Especially with age, things make a lot more sense and are much clearer. More specifically when it comes to what is realistic and what is not, maturity level definitely comes into play. Being 22 and watching it versus being 9, BIG difference. Overall, a lot of the events seemed to be in the realm of possibility. The movie is about a cruise-like ship that gets hit by a rogue wave on New Year's Eve. A group of people band together to try and escape before the ship sinks completely and they drown. Throughout the movie they are hit with all kinds of turmoil. Crashing elevators, people getting smashed to death, people being swept away by water and drowning, fires, you name it. The science seemed relatively sound while watching it, but also, I'm not going to fact check in the middle of a movie. But being of a scientific background, a decent number of things seemed to check out. Obviously (*spoiler alert*), Kurt Russell drowning and miraculously having one last breath and then successfully hitting the magic button to save them all is pretty farfetched, but glass breaking from water pressure, or flash fires, or loose and wild electrical wires electrocuting people are things that could and probably would happen! But now let's get serious. If this were to have happened in real life, lord knows more than just one person on the ship managed to see it outside and there would already be a state of panic. People do not do well in these kinds of situations. I also do not think sealing everybody in one room was the best plan, especially if the boat is kind of you know upside down and sinking? But what do I know about nautical safety? On top of that, there would have been a lot more stubborn people trying to find a way off the ship than just that little crew, you expect people to sit tight while a boat is capsized and sinking? The conveniently placed life raft at the end of the movie is truly my favorite part though, or is it when the ship sinks the instant the last escapee jumps into the raft? But all in all, scientifically I think Poseidon is a good disaster movie. Rogue waves do exist and a lot of the events that took place could have been likely, but at the end of the day, Hollywood still takes over but surprisingly the movie is not too farfetched. 7.5/10!",Poseidon
593,hexplode11,Disatrous Disaster Film,1,4 June 2007,"I usually do not rate a movie so low. Especially for my first review. But this movie deserves it. The cast is good, that is what I can say. But in this movie, the best that they do is show how scared the characters are. The idea for the movie is good. Unfortunately, Wolfgang Peterson screwed up on it. There are many characters in this movie. Three of them died. Two of them are low class citizens. The richest survived. Crowe's character managed to sacrifice his life just to reverse the propellers of the ship(I do not really know why this would be necessary for a ship anyways). There is a boy who somehow managed to stay on a fixed piano when the ship flipped. The piano should have fallen off, but as if that wasn't a miracle, its amazing that later the boy would just end up in strange places, so that the movie could be further delayed for some ""action"". Really amazing. The characters themselves are amazing. They are supernatural. They happen to be able to hold their breath for a long time (just try holding your breath during the underwater sequences), dive from high places and not hit the floor, let alone stand the freezing water. There are explosions everywhere, the famous ""Hollywood"" explosions that are far away from reality. Its a wonder that there is any oxygen on the ship. Those huge flames would have sucked it all up. And as usual, there is a happy ending, with the characters miraculously finding a life boat in an ocean with no other debris from the ship. Characters complain about marriages, spend time standing for a total half hour observing the damage of the ship, and waiting for any people who are afraid of confined spaces. Anybody would leave anyone behind who they don't know for the sake of their survival. All during a disaster. This movie really needs more effort, it was boring as well. Nothing to interesting for this movie. Its shame enough that all of the movie on now are just remakes of stories, books, myths, and other popular culture items. But this movie is just terrible, don't sit through an hour watching this movie.",Poseidon

I love movies and am usually an easy critic but this feature was a total catastrophe. The acting was horrible. At no point in their rambling could I take anything they said even remotely seriously. The ""suspensful"" moments were nothing short of lame and annoying. The entire movie was completely predictable from the beginning. The only thing that kept me watching this was Nelson.

And this is what this is. Its knows it is, and the actors know it is. Director Wolfgang Petersen delivers a silly plot-thin but crazy pyrotechnic action film not unlike his last stupid actioner Air Force One, and to this end creates a claustrophobic (upside down) roller-coaster which proves an adrenaline rush start to end. Action veteran Kurt Russell proves an emotional core to the story and upcoming action hero Josh Lucas (who proved his daft action mettle in Stealth) is simply brilliant. The rest of the supporting cast are simply that; supporting, offering a way into the moral dilemmas and stupid situations they find themselves in as they traverse the labyrinthine upturned cruise ship. With Klaus Badelt's crazy bombastic score, this is one masterpiece of escapism. Don't expect anything else and you won't be disappointed; of course its not as good as the original - were you expecting to be? Silly you, then.""You stay here, you drown!!"" - class.",Poseidon
597,edwardgamper,Poseidon was pretty darned good actually,8,11 October 2009,"Having read some of the other reviews of Poseidon, I noticed a common trend. Everyone refers to the original, 'The Poseidon Adventure'. It's reminiscent of the old movie-based-on-a-book debate. Typically this divides audiences into two camps. Those that have read the book and those that haven't. More often than not, those who do not like the movie have read the novel. Think of The Beach and the responses that got, ""Oh but in the book Richard loves video games and they don't really...""The stronger reactions, the more critical responses are more likely to come from those people who have read the book or seen the original.This is fair enough, if you have an affection for the original movie, or if the remake is worse, then it is intensely annoying. Nothing would be worse than say, a remake of Taxi Driver starring Vin Diesel. I think in that instance, we would all be up in arms.However, I haven't seen the original Poseidon movie so I feel I'm able to make an objective judgement of this film.Now look folks, here's the thing... sometimes you just have to chill out and see a film for what it is. Poseidon is a genius B-movie. It feels straight to DVD. You can practically see the green screens at the start of the film and it's got Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas trying to act for crying out loud.But hell, it's 98 minutes of Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas leading a team of idiots through the world's worst Krypton Factor. Yes it's like a video-game, hell it even has levels. But that's what's so fun about the film. OK, I don't care if the woman from Day After Tomorrow dies, I laughed when Dreyfuss kicked Freddy Rodríguez to his death and I was willing the kid to die from the moment I laid eyes on his stupid face.But the great thing about Poseidon, is it just gets down to it. So there's no build up to the wave but that's what's so scary about it, it's the sheer lack of build up that makes it so sudden. It leaves you with a real sense of 'whoa, they have thirty seconds to turn that bloody boat!""And then BAM! We're off on a brilliant adventure. It's got explosions, big hold-your-breath moments, lift-shafts, tense crawling-up-vents action and Josh Lucas diving two hundred feet into some water... that's on fire!I've no doubt this is, story-wise and character-wise, weaker than the original. But I haven't seen the original so it doesn't bother me. If I had, this may have been a vastly different review. It's the individual's attachment or love of the original that often colours their opinion of a remake.I love intelligent, well crafted, engaging films as much as the next person. But sometimes, I just like to crack open a massive pack of Doritos or Haribo Starmix and watch Kurt Russell sliding down a rope without having an nervous breakdown every time some character dies.I thought this was an awesome pop-corn movie that was genuinely tense, kept me involved till the very end, amused me and is now part of my DVD collection, right next to Twister and The Day After Tomorrow.",Poseidon
598,darkmoon3d,What a disappointment,5,22 August 2006,"As a fan of the original when I heard a remake was being made; I didn't think much until I heard that Wolfgang Peterson was attached. Having enjoyed much of his past work he's truly mastered the ocean movie with ""Das Boot"" and ""The Perfect Storm"". Was hoping he'd fill in where original Poseidon Adventure didn't do so well (mainly the effects). While the original Poseidon Adventure is pretty much perfect in every regard; story, characters, intense action, set pieces, physical effects, music. For the nitpicky I found some of the stunts, underwater explosions, scale models, and tidal wave to look a bit fake. With the remake Peterson has ILM (from Perfect Storm) to help update the film. Unfortunately the effects just didn't work. While bold in scope and cutting edge in technique and technology; bad editing and impossible situations help water them down into nothing. For example the original actually explains why a tidal wave was in middle of ocean. In original they're in Mediteranean and the tidal wave was ""building up in the shallows"" which is exactly what it does in real life. However in new film this is never mentioned and fact that ship is in middle of ocean is made obvious given when she finally sinks (no surprise) where we see the ship fall away into deep abyss.The trailer was very believable with how it's presented. The original trailer having the new years song (can't remember name) being sung as we see tidal wave approach as screen fades to black. This gave me goosebumps with anticipation. The movie is different and instead presents boring stereotypical characters. Their not necessarily annoying but it's just hard to care for who's going to die next or not.Instead of going on with endless comments of how movie fell short (music, vfx, physical plausibility) I'll mention a few scenes or parts I did like. The scope of ideas presented seemed cool but just felt boring or just not interesting. For example elevator which falls over across lobby was cool idea, along with ac units, and machinery falling from floor er.. ceiling. An interesting scene was having to crawl through an air conditioning duct to escape rising water. No fat ladies to block the way this time unfortunately ;) Other scenes include flooding ballast tanks and using bow thrusters as means of escape.",Poseidon

600,cajun_lgb,Flush This Drowned Rat of a Movie,1,26 April 2007,"If only negative scores were possible. This was truly the worst movie I saw last year.I WANT THE NINETY MINUTES OF MY LIFE THIS PIECE OF RAW SEWAGE STOLE FROM ME. Wolfgang Petersen, you should have to turn in your DGA card for this. A putrid remake of a movie that was only fair to begin with.... That takes chutzpah.A quick synopsis of the plot, such as it is: A badly-rendered CGI big boat, full of badly-rendered character types played by current B- and D-list performers (Josh Lucas, Emmy Rossum, Kevin Dillon) as well as former A-listers who need to fire their current agents (Kurt Russell, Richard Dreyfuss), gets knocked upside-down by an equally badly-rendered CGI wave fifteen minutes into the first reel, before we get any real reason to care about anyone in the cast, but not before we're subjected to Fergie of the Black-Eyed Peas ""singing"". Twenty seconds into that song (someone obviously thought it would be a sure-fire hit) and you're rooting for the wave to just sink the boat and put her out of our misery.But no; a ragtag group of survivors led by Russell (ex-NYC mayor, formerly a firefighter-- how lucky is that?!?) and Lucas (ex-Navy diver-- how lucky is that?!?) start making their grim way to the now-exposed to air hull, before the ship takes on enough water that it sinks blah blah blah. The blatant sops to the right-wingers in the crowd made me throw up in my mouth several times; note that the ""girls"" and the ""sissy"" are really no help (you gotta have a He-man firefighter or ex-military guy to get you out of these scrapes!), and how about that lucky crucifix that doubles as a flat-blade screwdriver and air vent remover (""Thank you Jeey-sus for the $8.95 someone spent at a swap meet for you!!"")? And we still have to wait an hour before Petersen remembers to kill off Fergie. Don't think we forgot about her, Wolfie. We were patient far too long.Thankfully I didn't spend a dime to see this piece of junk. I watched every minute of it, getting angrier and angrier at the sheer contempt in which the makers obviously hold the viewing public, and couldn't hit the ""Erase"" button on my DVR fast enough after.

601,zobirdie,I thought it was great!,8,14 May 2006,"A movie that had me on the edge of my seat and was entertaining.It took my mind off my job and the big project I have coming up! Thanks Wolfgang Peterson! I had a great time!I think too many people are looking at this movie for something it isn't supposed to be. It isn't supposed to have a great 'message' or 'theme'. It's not billing itself as another 'Hotel Rwanda' or 'The Life of David Gale'. The movie is about a ship sinking and people trying to save their lives! Personally, I'm going to see it again! It had action, adventure, floating bodies, explosions, tension, Kurt Russel ;) and a not too obnoxious kid. (I will admit, I could have done without the kid!) It was visually beautiful and the CGI was incredible. It's a Summer Action Movie! Popcorn and a Soda! Not deep, no message, just a good time! Quite frankly, that's why I go to the movies. Escapism.

No character development whatsoever!! The movie rushes through the 1972 plot so fast, I was left at the end wondering. They cram a 2.5 hour plot from the 1972 film into an hour and a half!! Although done well, it leaves you at the end of the movie wishing for more. Personally I felt the 2005 TV version was better, even though it deviated from the original more, it had more substance.

604,coasterwiz,Good Disaster Film,8,8 June 2006,"I think that we all know the basic plot of the film, so let's just jump to the review. This movie was truly intense, just as the MPAA rating implies. Once the action and ""peril"" begins, it simply doesn't let up until the end of the film. The question, however, is this: how much peril too much? There is no comedic relief during any of the disaster scenes, and hardly a break in between the (suprisingly intense) action. Although, it makes one wonder if comedic relief would truly be appropriate in a film of this nature. I'm not complaining about how intense it was, however, it was a very intense film, and some thought it was overly intense. However, I suppose this made the film more realistic. There were quite a few moments that you were on the edge of your seat. In addition, this was not a disaster film that one could easily laugh at (ie: Twister, Volcano, Dante's Inferno), which is truly necessary in any good disaster film. There are a few basic flaws with the film, however. I did not feel that there was enough exposition to the film. The characters needed a little bit more development, especially the character Richard Nelson (played well by Richard Dreyfuss.) Some of the CGI effects were lacking (some looked terribly fake, which was easily seen on the IMAX screen that I saw the film at. Also, in one part of the film, the film would go back and forth between two different groups and conflicts, which I found terribly annoying. All in all, the film was pretty darn good.Pros: - Good score by Klaus Badelt - Truly intense, not easy to laugh at - Pretty good acting, for a disaster movie - No ""annoying"" characters - For the most part, good special effects - Good rising action, climax, and resolution - Looks and sounds great in IMAX versionCons: - Some bad CGI effects - Not enough character development - Too intense for some? Overall: Good disaster film. A little skimpy on character development, but that does not affect enjoyment of the film too much. Very intense. 8/10",Poseidon

There's practically no character development at all, and almost everything in the movie was completely implausible. The ship probably wouldn't even have capsized under the conditions shown. Additionally: Why would an architect know about ship design? Why would ballast tanks have valves that only open when the tank is full, and remain closed when they're empty? For that matter, what kind of moron would flood the ballast tanks on a sinking ship? How do the bow thruster propellers, being designed to move water, manage to move air with such force that stuff flies around the room? Why, at every turn, is this ship filled with horribly flammable things for our intrepid escapologists to deal with? Massive explosions, rivers and waterfalls of burning liquids, flash fires are all encountered in abundance. I could go on. Oh, OK, I will! Why are these the only people trying to escape from a ship carrying thousands of passengers? Why is every room they enter littered with dead bodies and no survivors? Why didn't the people who were on deck at the time the wave struck abandon ship? Why does the gas canister they throw into the bow propeller explode? Given that it does, it seems, create a *huge* explosion, how does it *not* kill the guy standing right next to it!? Finally, after an hour of tolerating cliché after goof after far-fetched oh-my-god-we-only-just-made-it-ism, we're asked to believe that they get out of the ship and fortuitously find a life raft in the water, just where they need it. Then they shoot their flare before they see any rescuers. Smart, eh? This film was so implausible that I found it nigh impossible to suspend my sense of disbelief. You can tell, right?

That is the nature of the beast. If you want to rip the guts out of this film like Mr. Thumb Guy then all you will find is a live action video game where sometimes the players hold their breath and swim. I imagine he could heartless describe anything in the same manner. And so could I. Why not watch a romantic comedy and spend your time looking for all the false moments.

Well, I guess this movie just isn't meant for viewers that work on ships or otherwise know about naval architecture. But I have to say, for me it was a total non-stop horror ride - equaling the reality merits of, let's say, Speed 2. Actually Poseidon is not a film of 1/10, but because it's totally rendered 'not for certain audiences', I must give such a rating. PS.

The advantage Poseidon has is that it is not a remake of a film that was excellent, it too had it's problems but in other areas when compared to the remake. Poseidon is neither a better or a worse attempt than the original. 2006 however has more to offer in the range of effects especially CGI than back in 1972 and it rocks. The script here is less focused on the characters and their lives, just enough details are given. The pacing is much better though, the original being near 2 hours with short credits. Poseidon is 89 minutes up to the credits, this runtime being about right for the the fast pace the movie adopts and ensures that it is never boring. Critics have had a go at this movie, but to be honest you don't have time to take this into account because Poseidon is an action/adrenaline packed ride.

A ship gets flipped over and people work there way up through to the bowels to escape.....Wow man we should through in a plot hook like the ship is a hot dog or maybe a giant Taco...yeah that's it and they have to eat there way out. For those of you who are not retards this movie rocks ass, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and has you wondering who will die NEXT. Now if your one of those people who goes to one movie a year and only one save your money i'm sure it will be better spent on x3 or superman.

616,qwertzjeee,Review,10,4 January 2015,"This is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen. It's also an extremely bad movie. The script is really weak. The lines were pathetic. The characters just damned awful. I was really hoping that everyone in the group died -- that included that little kid. There just is nothing really likable about this movie. The special effects are good, but I can play video games if I want to see special effects. Aside from really awful and dislikeable characters, there are four other things that ruin this movie (IMO): 1. The original was a great movie. If you're going to remake a great movie, at least make something good. 2. The set up was of the movie was bad. It happened too quickly. I guess they were desperate to show the tidal wave as quickly as possible. 3. The ending was just lame. 4. When you have good actors in a movie, please have a good script for them. But also the Poseidon is Greek God of the sea and the storms and earthquakes. Because the whole story inexpensive because they give the respect of the Greek gods. We need to be afraid and had respect to our God and to Jesus Chris not to their Gods.",Poseidon
617,fab_o,"A visual gem, or, how disaster reinforces traditional family ties",7,25 June 2006,"There in nothing fair about who is going to live and who is going to die. This sentence just condenses the meaning of the film where only rich, beautiful white people, led by the virtuous strength of traditional partnership and parenthood (together with Christian morality) survive in the end. I cannot say I didn't enjoy this movie, I actually enjoyed it a lot on the huge IMAX screen, with stunning CGI effects, and continuous action. I was just annoyed by some of the symbols. Afro- and Latino-Americans just die (and I must say that I admired the nasty lack of being politically correct, at first). But come on! (-_-#)People playing at the casino are no good (even worse if they like to drink). The suicidal gay hero is just able to kill the ""gorgeous"" waiter to survive, and then, helpless as he is, he can make it until the end just thanks to the other members' charity (also considering that he is the eldest survivor). The unrepentant and unscrupulous single Dylan, is redeemed from evil by being incorporated in the nuclear family model (especially when his earlier sensual interest in the mother is diverted, in the second part of the movie, into some father-figure sense of responsibility toward the son). I won't comment on subliminal gadgets such as the play-station and the chain with the ivory cross. However, it is quite peculiar that nobody thinks of taking some food or drink with them (considering that nobody knows how many hours lie between them and the rescue team), but probably this happens because they are all worried about the fact that toilets are upside down and, therefore, not to be used. Certainly the silliest thing in the whole movie is the fact that in a flooded ship, with several underwater scenes, they stay with all their clothes on, without stripping even a tiny bit (ah OK, I forgot, Maggie cut off some 10 cm from her dress train!). I am perfectly aware it is just a movie though, so, if you don't mind hidden messages and puritan chastity, just enjoy this action gem (and IMAX is my recommendation).",Poseidon
618,CooperNRG,"Good movie that gives me the ""edge of my seat"" feeling (SPOILERS!!!).",8,3 March 2007,"People commenting on this movie have blasted it for not having character development and for having bad acting. Who are these people? The opening scenes (and the subsequent character development scenes) gave us all we need to know. Kurt Russell's character is an overbearing parent (but is so only because of the great love he has for his daughter), who looks after his daughter with the same intensity as any other overbearing parent, Josh Lucas plays the traveling gambler who turns out to have a hear of gold, while the other characters get briefly set up and allow their character development to occur throughout the film. The actors also made the characters believable, something that characterizes this movie as having good acting. The scenes that were meant to have an ""edge of your seat"" moment captured that, and the scenes that were supposed to spark some type of emotion did (I'm thinking of near the end when the mother and son were separated by the metal grate, and Lucas' character dives under and gets the boy back to his mother). And so what if there was a lifeboat with flares waiting after the survivors got the the surface. Do the previous ""critics"" know anything about movies. Movie goers go to movies for one thing. TO ESCAPE FROM REALITY! In real life the survivors would have go through all the obstacles as those in the movie only to drown or freeze to death in the water. Do people really want to see this reality for 9-10 dollars a person? NO. They want to see a happy ending where the hero and the mother/son combo survive. Faulting this movie for doing so is to be totally ignorant of human nature. This was a goo movie!",Poseidon

Richard Dreyfus speaks very little - thats a bonus. Kurt Russel does his tough guy routine - groundbreaking? - not really. Special effects are OK - especially the ""rogue"" wave. Reminds me a little of Stallone's 'Daylight' (1996) - rooms are always filling with water at varying speeds. Women undertakes a good deal of difficult climbing and swimming with heels on - props. Did not encounter enough new people along the way for my liking. Except the sleezeball character who was the best character among them - sort of like Matt Dillon's character in something about Mary. Quite impressed with peoples extraordinary ability to hold their breath in this movie - much unlike the audience. Breath easy, this will only kick your heart-rate up very marginally.",Poseidon

This is not Capra and for heavens sake, duh, it is not the original either. However what it is - is a good ""Get the summer action thrill ride move season off with a bang"" (sans any sofa jumping religious cultists baggage) heck of a fun movie. The pedantry of what waves can or cannot do has nothing to do with the reality what this kind of film is: a big screen just for the thrills escapist ride. So suspend your disbelief and enjoy already. I'll be interested to see if the DVD version has the story line elements that were edited out. I am actually hoping they are the right kind of bad.

Poseidon is held up only by its amazing effects just like Day After Tomorrow. If you liked the movie Titanic, DO NOT see this movie. in Titanic, the audience is emotionally attached to the ship with scenes like the sex in the car and the waiting at the clock. in Poseidon, you aren't given a full tour of the ship before the incident, when the ship doesn't capsize, there is no shock value of your ""home"" going under water. even though in Poseidon, there were diverse scenes of action like in Dante's Peak, they weren't fully taken in because of no resting time for the audience.",Poseidon
622,perfectsince1984,Great movie,8,9 May 2006,"Whenever a remake or a sequel of a movie comes out, I'm usually the one who enjoys the ""newness"" of the movie, and would therefore prefer the most recent edition to the original. (Although there have been some cases where I thought the original was much better) I'll admit I have not seen the original Poseidon, so therefore I went into the movie with a fresh mind and didn't hold any rules or regulations as to how the movie ""must be."" True, there are some movies that need that special element in them that make them true classics. Having said that, and as the previous reviewer noted, the actual event of the tidal wave happened really fast with very little character development, but as the movie went on, you begin to find out little by little who the characters really are.The movie drew my attention (and those I attended with) so deeply that I even forgot they had made me leave my cell phone in the car (I'm highly addicted to my phone!) If there is any movie that is able to make me leave the real world and be so submerged into it, then I do truly feel that it's a movie worth seeing. The only drawback to this movie is some element of predictability -- You know certain things must happen and you can pinpoint when it's going to happen and how it's going to affect certain characters (I'm trying to write this without spoilers...) Even with the predictability (At points) and how quickly the wave hit without really getting into detail of the characters backgrounds (and how magically all of them just wound up in the same location to escape together..), I thoroughly enjoyed it and would definitely see it again and recommend it to friends. It was nice to see Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss in a movie again (since I haven't really seen anything recent of theirs) and Josh Lucas adds some spiff to the film. The rest of the cast is amazing, and I will say that any ""tragedy"" film with a little kid in it usually has a kid that is annoying and you just wish they'd shut up and learn their lesson, even though they never do..however the child in Poseidon is actually lovable! A first for any movie I've seen!",Poseidon
623,Root_Beer,Trying to Hard,3,12 May 2006,"Poseidon strives to create intense and dramatic scenes but comes up as over-manufactured suspense. In other words, they are trying to hard to be dramatic and suspenseful. Adding to this effect is a dialog that's below average 70% of the time. There's lots of ""I just met you 20 minutes ago, but we're going to make it out of here!"" type of exchanges. It's not the bottom of the barrel exactly, it does have semi-impressive special effects adding up for about 15 minutes worth of watchable material.If you like to watch CGI bodies falling to their death and hard to believe plot developments then this is the movie for you. However, if 7$-10$ is of any value to you, you'd be better off spending it elsewhere. 3/10",Poseidon
624,dylwil,An Incredibly Underrated Film,8,14 May 2006,"Poseidon is the story of a cruise ship that is hit by a rogue wave and is flipped upside down and ten people who try to find their way out. Since many had given it bad reviews and something like 2 stars, I went into it with a bad feeling. By the end, however, I was very glad I had gone. Though the plot line isn't great (though very original, I must say) it was very well acted and very intense. I can only remember a couple of moments when I was not sitting of the edge of my seat, anxious to see what would happen next. It was also very well shot. Some of the shots (like the ones in the vent) were very hard to do for the actors because they were very claustrophobic, and the camera shots made many scenes, this scene in particular, which could have been very boring, into a moment of intensity. I would HIGHLY recommend Poseidon to anyone who likes VERY intense movies (e.g. National Treasure, etc.)",Poseidon

626,nightrunner42,A Decent Disaster Pic,7,5 June 2006,"Let's face it - Poseidon was doomed to failure from the beginning. STRIKE #1: The film's script not only stripped away all character development from the story - the aspect that sets the original apart from every other movie of it's kind - but did not manage to improve upon the dialogue that dogged the '72 version. THe script is completely humorless and devoid of any actual emotion. STRIKE #1.5: Warner Bros. should never have spent such a massive amount of money (estimated as high as $160M)on such an awful script; they were dooming themselves to failure. STRIKE # 2: The majority of it's target audience of teens and early 20 year-old males have probably never even heard of the original, let alone seen it. And those that have were treated to a Camp classic, with mostly hammy acting and some seriously cheesy dialogue. STRIKE #3: The film's trailer did absolutely nothing to set it apart from every other action/disaster pic made in the last decade. It highlighted the splashy special effects, which are inarguably award-worthy, but made the film look like a cheesy telepic.That said, Poseidon is an enormously entertaining movie, so long as its audience is capable of ignoring the terrible lines uttered by its stereotyped and clichéd characters. No character is developed beyond the first dimension, and the performances echo that underdevelopment. Mercifully, the film runs at a breathless 98 minutes, so it never manages to reach the obscene level of awful-ness reviews would lead you to expect.As far as pure escapism entertainment goes, you can do a lot worse than Poseidon. Look no further than many of this summer's other tentpole pics - M:I-3, Da Vinci Code, even X-Men 3. Poseidon is the only one that manages to surprise and entertain on every level, with nary a dull moment. It might be campy and over-the-top, but it's a remake of one of the campiest films ever to earn the title of ""classic.""",Poseidon

I wasn't expecting much from a movie where a ship turns upside down and people try to escape - it had 'Titanic' written all over it again! Even the rating said PG-13 - Long scenes of disaster. how true was that!I was surprised though by the end at how well I managed to stayed focused throughout the whole movie. It was full of action, suspense, humour, and sadness, but a thoroughly enjoying movie. It makes you come out of the movie not feeling happy but wanting you to appreciate what family and friends you do have.Well worth seeing though!",Poseidon

There wasn't a moment in the film where you thought,""Man, that is so fake."" only the parts where they have to go under water, it seemed that they held their breath for way too long, and some scenes felt like they just crammed them in to add length.The tidal wave was just like the ones that you have nightmares about, scary stuff but I think the wave came in too quickly and I Wanted to get to know the characters a bit better before they all start panicking. It seemed that 95% of the whole movie was the sinking of the ship and the intense action.Overall an excellent movie to go and see, I saw the Omen on the same day and i thought that Poseidon was much better. Just my opinion though but it is a film to go and try out but this film definitely doesn't match up to Titanic.",Poseidon

This it did indeed - my worst expectations that is. Anybody with half a brain would realize that the entertainment value of this movie is directly correlated with the direction that the ship in the movie is taking - namely down. The movie lacked any respect for the confines of common-sense, it doesn't even try to hide this. Character development is nearly non-existent, the movie really has no plot, is terribly predictable and corny to the extreme. Still the thing that ticked me off the most about this movie is that it was unrealistic at every turn - especially the characters of whom some turn seemingly into super-humans during the course of the movie.Bottom line: this movie stinks and is one of the worse piece of garbages I've seen in the past few months.

Admittedly it is a little cliché, and little time is spent on character development, but you can't help but root for 'most' of the characters to make it! The film is action-packed and fast moving. The acting is super (especially by Josh Lucas and Richard Dreyfuss), the stunts are amazing and it doesn't all get washed away in a sea of digital/special effects (no pun intended!). No one is talking Oscar material here, but I think the film deserves much better reviews that it is receiving.

All it was was one disaster after another and we didn't get a chance to get to know any of the people. James Cameron should have done this movie. Maybe he could have saved it from mediocrity. The only person we got to know anything about was Dreyfus's character. We got to see what kind of heart he had and what kind of person he was. He was a character we could relate to. But what about the history of any of the others? We know Josh Lucas's character was on a submarine at one time. Why? What happened? Kurt Russell was mayor of New York. That's it? That's all ya got? Kevin Dillon's character (who strikingly resembled his brother Matt's character in There's Something About Mary) was a total jackass but he was way under-used. The ending was predictable. Girl's fiancée is going to sacrifice himself to save them all but girl's daddy can't bear to see his daughter's heart broken so he sneaks off to do the dirty work himself, thereby sparing his daughter's fiancée.

Some people get bored in the first 17 mins, this is an essential part of the movie and builds the relationships which means we feel and care for these people when the events arises. we know their characters and we're willing them to survive.The plot - We join a ship with mostly rich people who are celebrating news years eve aboard a cruise liner. After midnight a wave hits the boat which flips it over. A group of survivors realise that survival depends upon getting off the ship - that means travelling to the top (i.e. the ships bottom).The acting is good and as an ensemble great, and i felt for their plight especially when it came to tight situations. The best man of course is Josh Lucus who plays hero Dylan - he's the best and i bet you'll back him too. The other great performances belong to Mia Maestrow as Elena and Jacinda Barrett as Maggie.The film can be considered short at around 90 mins but is a suitable length when dealing with the content.

Poor Kurt Russell; we were cracking up during a scene when he was giving mouth-to-mouth. I thought the movie would be more realistic and not so predictable. Even the special effects were amateurish.

There are some great moments and you can see where references to the original have been attempted. Gene Hackman's character is split in two - the rebellious Josh Lucas and the world weary Kurt Russell and Red Buttons bachelor becomes gay (Richard Dreyfuss).The deaths are more detailed and plausible than the original (They don't just disappear into water which they could surely have swum out from again).Yes, the wonderful conflict between characters (the bitchy ex-prostitute and her husband cop in the original) is completely missing and the characters are very stereotypical with very predictable plot lines. The relationship between Kurt Russell's ex-firefighter (spot the ""Backdraft"" in-joke) and his daughter's boyfriend and the way it is resolved could have been lifted straight from ""Armageddon"".If you go to see this expecting deep and meaningful relationships and characterisation, forget it.

It's what gives them their charm. It's also why you can't just say 'ooh, another crappy Hollywood blockbuster'. Disaster films are something different, and can't be held against the benchmark of other genres.I enjoyed 'Poseidon' a great deal, because it stayed true to the genre's form.

I have never seen the original, so I went into the theatre knowing only that it was about an upside-down ship.I'll grant you that the beginning (pre-wave) was incredibly rushed. The dialogue was choppy and the characters were introduced too quickly. The effects on the ship during the opening scene were only so-so. And obviously the lead-up to the wave was disappointing- kinda came out of nowhere...which I *guess* was the point, but it still felt very forced.Once the wave hit, however, was when it really started to pick up. Choppy dialogue or no, I found myself actually caring about the characters. The effects were fantastic and I never lost interest in what was happening.Overall, if you look at this movie for what it's supposed to be- an enjoyable popcorn flick/disaster movie -instead of what it was never intended to be (groundbreaking masterpiece), and if you stop comparing it the original, I think you'll enjoy it.After all, what would be the point of remakes if they were exactly the same as the original?",Poseidon

It's not exactly a re-make and granted some parts you know exactly whats going to happen but the thing that keeps you hooked is the suspense of imagining your stuck in the same situation. I rated this movie 8 out of 10 stars!",Poseidon
647,zacisconfused-1,"Amazing acting, amazing effects, amazing movie. Go see Posiedon.",10,15 May 2006,"Posiedon is an endearing story about these mostly strangers who all come and work together under life and death circumstances, to survive. For one The acting in Posiedon was great, and I truly was able to feel the connection with all the main characters. Emmy Rossum and Mia Maestro, in particular, are amazing actresses and it shows in this film. Also, the cinematography and special effects were very good and made me enjoy this film more. The story is very personal and is good in general. I found only a few very minor plot holes, but it did not bring the movie as a whole down. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I give it 9 out of 10. Only 9 because of the few plot holes.Over all, amazing acting, amazing effects, amazing movie!",Poseidon
648,ggonzalez7,"Waste of time, Titanic wannabe :(",1,17 May 2006,"I have seen this movie because everyone was raving about it but after seeing it, i literally was upset. This movie has such a titanic watered down wannabe plot that is just pathetic. Every scene can be anticipated and i do mean everyone! The ""disaster"" happens too sudden and just gives you a WTF look when it happens, mind you there is no background about this ""disaster"". Its just something that just.... happened. Its so dumb. The cabin of the ship, when they show it, looks like something they took out of the USS Enterprise (Star Trek) and it made me laugh. To be blunt everyone, this movie is very unrealistic and just written overnight. I wouldn't want to even rent it, if it came down to it. Please save your money and see another movie, so far Hollywood has made me upset because of the lack of good original movies.",Poseidon
649,Jordy-Paul,Review of Poseidon,8,25 August 2006,"I've just watched this movie, Poseidon, and, although it's not the best out of Wolfgang Peterson, I dare to say that it's not that bad a movie as I had heard before. The special effects were good and the action sequences were not out-of-this-world exaggerated. Apart from all that time under water, all other action parts were believable. And the fact that two people (four if you count Valentine and the drunken man) died it makes it even more so. I think what was lacking in this movie was more emotion and more focus on the main characters. I really disliked the idea that during the accident - the whole ship toppling over and everything - we did not see what was exactly happening to each of the main characters. Then, after the accident, we saw where they had ended up. To make viewers care more for the movie characters they should have shown us what they were exactly going through during the turning over of the Poseidon. But besides this the movie was a rather enjoyable one, although not the best of the Summer 2006 Blockbausters. It was a good one until it lasted.",Poseidon
650,ventgen,Hoping Enders is a predilection,1,24 August 2006,"Herr Petersen made several entertaining films but the last two are based entirely on greed and totally devoid of content. The numbers racket in Hollywood seem to give way to outright lies and, or missing any trace of humane factors. The public doesn't seem to be buying it. And with any luck will not be subjected to any further scams. The good ones often make mistakes but their overall efforts have at least a basic respect for intelligence and education. Please take some time off or just stop if you wish to retain some level of human dignity. I sincerely hope you can revive the elements which were an intrinsic part of your earlier work. It must be difficult in a world where the almighty dollar seems to push all other considerations to the sidelines. I wish you the best, Sicerely, Frank Ventgen",Poseidon
651,bakoonin,"It's OK, it's better than the '72 adventure, but it's no match for the novel",5,1 August 2006,"The people who hail the original The Poseidon Adventure of '72 as being better than this remake - because it IS a remake - must be either in denial or in a state of overwhelming nostalgia. Wolfgang Peterson is a better director, and Poseidon is better movie, end of discussion. Talking about Peterson; he obviously loves water, and when he gets to play with boats, lives and confined spaces, you're in for a ride. Poseidon is tight and claustrophobic, it's fast and gorgeous looking, and you can feel the desperation wherever the camera goes. If death and catastrophic violence is your game, you'll feast on people being crushed, hurled, flushed and drowned, electrocuted, fried, impaled and burnt - and still there is more, without wearing you out.The 2006 remake is far from perfect. It would benefit from portraying more of the darkness found in the novel. The script still holds a few grim moments, but this is an action flick, so just don't expect people fleeing for their lives to take long moments bathing in guilt (that's why they call it POST-traumatic stress). The cast feels a bit safe, almost boring, and some characters (Kevin Dillon - you knew his fate the moment he opened his mouth) really didn't bring anything to the movie that couldn't be replaced with, well, just about anything else. The pathetic background stories (yes, every last one of them) tend to bring you out of the story and into critic mode, but soon bodies and debris start levitating again, and you're right back in.In total, I find Poseidon to be far better than disastrous disaster movies like the Emmerlich turkey collection (The Day After Tomorrow and ID4), Twister, The Core, Armageddon and Deep Impact, but not at all up there with movies like The Abyss. Not very surprising, though, would anyone expect money loving Hollywood to sacrifice any income, even a tiny dollar, for something that would make a lasting emotional or - what a dangerous thought - intellectual impression outside the special effects?6.5/10",Poseidon
652,czae,I wouldn't give this a 0,1,8 January 2007,"Other than a few special effects that could actually have been better I thought the dialogue, script and SOUND was terrible. I had this movie ""given"" to me as a gift and unfortunately had to watch it to please the person who gave it to me.I found myself annoyed at the writer's ability to make the women look weak, whiny and absolutely USELESS (constant whining, screaming, crying, whimpering) while the males carried them somewhat like excess luggage that hampered their efforts to save them all through the ordeal.Now hey...Im not sure, but if I was an actress and read the script I would have been rather upset that there was at no time or place where a woman was of any use. I guess if you need the cash its better than doing porn. It became quite writer(s) didn't like women that much...(gay/bitter/bad divorce ...who knows) but made sure the whiners (all women of course) never survived) Other than that it was pretty generic as far as disaster films go and there was no effort made to improve the story.I think I'll give it away...really don't care that it was a gift.",Poseidon
653,mdculpepper,"Characters, what characters?",2,15 September 2006,"Simply put, this is a special effects driven movie. In the film, 'Poseidon', the characters are empty shells running, bobbing and swimming across the screen. For some (the senseless among us!), the continuous crash, bang, flash and boom will be enjoyable. I, too, can appreciate a good chase scene. However, I also enjoy a little more intellect in the films I choose to watch. And, in 'Poseidon' there was absolutely no characterization to the film. In the original movie, we had the opportunity to get the back-story behind all the major players and how they eventually came together as a group desirous of rescue. In this remake, we had none of that, we simply jumped right to the survival story...Snore!!! We are offered the occasional gratuitous familial love scene (father/daughter, sister/brother, husband/wife), but otherwise, none of the emotional dimension that one would expect at a time of crisis. Wolfgang Petersen did a terrific job in 'The Perfect Storm', what a happened here? This could have been a much better film. Be glad you didn't waste your money on the theater with this one. Even the DVD rental fee felt like too much of an investment!",Poseidon
654,dantoberman,"If this movie had to be made, a script would have been nice",1,15 May 2006,"I seriously wonder if there actually was a script for this movie. I think that the actors showed up on the set each day and were given a little instruction and that was about it. The remainder of the it was made be the CGI and special effects staffs (and not very well either.) This was like too many modern Hollywood ""blockbusters."" As if the canned story wasn't bad enough, you throw in awful performances by most of the cast and you get a top of the line bust. This movie had no character development, no flow, no plot and no point. It had no believability and too much predictability. It is bad enough on its own and that's before the inevitable comparisons to the Poseidon Adventure, which was much better in every way. Poseidon is probably the worst movie Wolfgang Peterson has ever made. If not, than it is definitely towards the top of the list. Previous Peterson movies such as Enemy Mine, In the Line of Fire, Air Force One and Troy were all decent movies (Outbreak and The Perfect Storm were OK as well). So although I would not recommend this movie to anyone, I would suggest that you not give up on him forever. As for the cast, Kurt Russell, Kevin Dillon, Richard Dreyfuss, Andre Braugher and Josh Lucas are going to continue to work, but I can't figure out why anyone else in this movie would.",Poseidon
655,fionamccormick,slight spoiler at the end of review,6,25 April 2007,"i did enjoy this film but yes it was a bit corny; i watched with my teenage daughter who loved the special effects but laughed at the supposed dramatic moments . We weren't told anything about the characters which meant that, as a result, we didn't seem to care that much about them. Maybe another 15 minutes giving us some background on them would help set the scene for the story. The special effects were great, the bit where they were stuck in the vent was truly horrific - well i thought so anyway!! Watched this on DVD, probably the effects would have come across better at the cinema. expected a bit more of this film i think, the special effects were great but not much characterisation so a bit short on empathy. the ending was definitely corny too - an empty available lifeboat just waiting for them???",Poseidon
656,vprincejr,How much script....,5,14 May 2006,"I thought of so many problems with this movie...I would give the special effects a 10 and the acting a 3. If you think about this movie how many pages of lines did the MAJOR characters have? I doubt each MAJOR character had any more than 2 pages of lines. This movie was done because the director was like a little boy in a toy store. He was playing with all the special effects he could think of. The special effects held me to watch this movie, but a lot of good actors were wasted in this movie. They could of had unknowns like the movie ""Flight 93"". I was also amazed on the amount of time people were holding their breaths underwater. It's one thing to hold your breath underwater for a long time, but when you are in a stressful situation the amount of time you can hold your breath underwater greatly diminishes.",Poseidon
657,wordsmithtim,"This sucked, and not in a good way",1,1 September 2006,"OK, I kind of see the necessity the filmmakers behind Poseidon felt in remaking the 1972 disaster classic, The Poseidon Adventure; what with the state of the art special effects advances that have transpired in the last thirty four years. With that said, there's no amount of wizardry that can hold a candle to the effect that was Shelly Winters chutzpah as Mrs. Rosen in the original. I could do a laundry list of reasons why the original cast of survivors - Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Stella Stevens, Pammy Sue Martin and even Carol Lynley - blow the new cast including Kurt Russell, bargain basement Matthew McConaughey Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfus as a despondent gay man who can get cell phone reception at sea, Emmy Rossum and Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas (going by her Kids Incorporated given name of Stacy Ferguson) out of the water. But that would involve giving a lick about any of the characters, which I didn't. And, the reason they leave us high and dry is because the characterizations are about as subtle as the wave that capsizes the boat: I'm rebellious, I'm suave, I'm a single mom, etc. might as well be tattooed on everyone's foreheads, and not even for clarity's sake- just so that the actor's could remember who they are playing, because the audience certainly won't. There is no character development whatsoever, which makes an audience disengaged and not want to root for these people. I wished the wave that capsizes the boat had left nary a survivor, which transpires fifteen minutes into this disaster of a flick. At the twenty five minute mark, a man (the captain, I think, but who knows in this movie) announces to the passengers that they have most likely been struck by a ""rogue wave,"" which can be ""dangerous."" Really? Is that why they are standing on what used to be the ceiling? At that point I turned off the movie in disgust, feeling cheapened that I had cheated on the original, one of my all time favorite movies. Chalk it up to if it ain't broke, don't fix it! That's twenty five minutes I'll never get back, I could have gotten an early start on my income taxes, or been partway through a root canal in the time it took me to realize I had chosen unwisely.",Poseidon
658,Troy202,Poseidon BIG on Special Effects But Lacks Substance,4,15 May 2006,"Director and producer Wolfgang Petersen remake of Irwin Allen's 1973 thrilling, cult-classic The Poseidon Adventure now retitled simply Poseidon, falls short of the films publicity ballyhoo. While the film is grand on sets and special effects, it lacks the substance and character of the original. One doesn't get to appreciate the ship at any level. The ship is a modern cruiser, lacking the greatness or ""personality"" of those ships of yesteryear. It isn't the new Poseidon's fault; we don't really get to see the guts of the ship; the functions; nor get to really see the crew in character as you saw in the original.Kurt Russell is already trapped in an out of date ""pops-doesn't-like-daughter's-boyfriend-routine."" Emmy Rossum as Russell's daughter doesn't add much, and Mike Vogel's pouting, pretty boy routine wear thins in a few minutes. Josh Lucas as sort of antihero fares somewhat better and provides a bit of much needed charisma this movie needs, but it isn't enough to keep Poseidon afloat. You don't get to feel empathy or even sympathy for anyone because the fault lies within a script that is superfluous when it comes to the characters.Richard Dreyfus should have jumped ship and avoided playing a depressed gay man who tries to do a Rose deWitt Buckater, but this time there is no Jack Dawson to rescue him. Instead we see an immense "" rogue wave"" heading the way of the ship, which prompts Dreyfus' character to change his mind. Gorgeous bombshell Stacy Ferguson is around for window dressing. Mia Maestro fares a bit better as the Spanish stowaway. Jacinda Barrert playing a single mom with a little boy, to add cuteness to the film, doesn't help much. And Kevin Dillon is so obnoxious that you'd wish he had been washed overboard to begin with. The crash of the rogue wave against the Poseidon is spectacular and incredibly realistic, but not really frightening. This is the point when the film comes alive and the spectacular special effects kick in high gear with people flying by, glass elevators crashing, and when Poseidon totally capsizes, you get to see the ship full lit, underwater with debris, chairs and floating bodies---and even little fishes swimming about, almost looking inside the huge glass windows of the Poseidon's now-submerged grand ballroom. You just might as well walk out of the movie theater because it's over. But do stay and watch the special effects because they are terrific, one right after another. You are barely getting into a scene when they have already moved to do something else in order to have more special effects, more explosions and more water pouring in. There is no memorable deluge, no scenes that tug at your heart, nor a chance to even cry-even if you wanted to.Thankfully, the movie is only 99 minutes and then it's over as soon as it began. As the publicity claims, Poseidon's survivors are in ""a race against the clock."" It does seem that way, but to get the movie over. It's badly edited, cut and pasted in such a rush to get to the special effects. Despite the publicity and the grandeur of special effects, this Poseidon sinks faster than the Titanic and the original Poseidon Adventure remains unique and easily sails by this disaster of a movie.",Poseidon
659,jaymeeharkeen,Not too bad,7,23 November 2018,"I'm a real sucker for adventure/survival movies. I know this movie isn't really that good, but for some reason I can't stop watching it. Richard Dryfuss is great. When he says ""Thank you georgous."" to Valentine, it's so sweet. I also really like the guy who plays Dylan too. He's beautiful.
I like it that these insanely rich people find themselves in a horrible situation and manage to work together to figure out a way to survive. I think the acting is good and the script is ok. I didn't find it cliche. It's not the best movie ever made, by a long shot. But there's lots of well built up tension. But I've watched it multiple times and I really enjoy it.",Poseidon

It had tons of explosions and action, suspense, and a pretty descent plot. People were wrong about this...please don't listen to them. Maybe this won't be a movie that's your favorite, but it's a fun movie to see with your friends and have fun with. Oh yeah, and don't buy popcorn, because you won't even be concentrating on eating, you'll be so into the movie that you won't even want to go to the bathroom either. It's not a boring movie, the action kicks in right away. See, it depends if the movie is a boring movie because it depends if your seeing it alone or with other people.

A huge special effect... and that's all! Where have they gone catastrophic movies like The Towering Inferno and the old Poseidon Adventure Hollywood was able to produce? Movies in which the skill of the actors was always present at any moment.
