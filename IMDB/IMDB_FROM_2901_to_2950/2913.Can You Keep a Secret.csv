0,SnoopyStyle,functional rom-com,6,10 May 2020,"Emma Corrigan (Alexandra Daddario) is a junior marketing executive for an energy drink and flying home from Chicago after a bad sales meeting. The flight attendant takes pity on her and bumps her up to first class. The plane runs into turbulence. Fearing imminent death, she drunkenly spills out all of her secrets to the hot stranger sitting next to her. She is embarrassed when they land safely on the ground. When she gets to work, she is further embarrassed to find the hot stranger to be her new boss Jack Harper (Tyler Hoechlin).This starts with a solid meet-cute and a fine premise. Daddario is a hot girl trying to stretch into comedies. She still has work to do but she's showing some promising skills at being awkward. She's not quite there and it would help to have better writing. Hoechlin is a functional romantic lead but he shows little comedic skills. He's better at action or being stoic. At the least, he should try more business casual instead of the non-stop workout casual. When a guy has those pecks, he likes to show them off in a tight T-shirt. The rom-com has a few bumps along the way but generally goes on a predictable journey. There are issues of dating the boss. There are modern sensibilities that the movie needs to be more careful about. My main issue with this movie is the rest of the cast and the directions in general. Some are fine but some are bad. Emma only needs one roommate and Lissy is good. I know what Gemma is trying to be but it's annoying. It's trying too hard. That goes for the workplace. There are a few functional characters but Emma needs only one mean-girl enemy. The mean girl is fine and the work husband needs a better actor. Everybody else is a waste of time. That brings us to the boyfriend Connor. He needs to be a cold corporate type. The hairy butt is not funny. He's too meek. He is basically a nice guy and that's not enough to root against. He's pathetic and the movie wants to laugh at him. That's different from he's a bad person and we want Emma to get away from him. A lot of the problem starts with the directing. It's generally uninspired with moments of bad directing. I can take the uninspired formula but the bad directing stands out. This is a functional rom-com and I like Daddario for the most part.",Can You Keep a Secret
1,kosmasp,Depends ...,6,26 July 2021,"I don't think the movie has that many secrets ... although we may wonder what the fuss about that one secret is all about. I probably missed the importance of it ... apart from ""don't tell anyone"" and that being broken, I can't see the weight of it.But why even question that (no pun intended), when you can just have fun with this movie. And I have to admit, I am biased. I mean it's Daddario ... how can I not love her? Even that completely insecure mess she is portraying here ... and it's not just the external beauty, it is the wit and charisma. She may not be the best actress around (though she didn't have too many roles to prove that - haven't seen True Detective yet - her best work as I am led to believe), but she is at least a really good one. No that it is needed in this comedy ...",Can You Keep a Secret
2,phd_travel,Tiresome dialogue,4,16 September 2019,"Alexandra is sweet enough. But she is given too much dialogue. Tyler looks a bit fierce for romantic comedies.

3,Thanos_Alfie,Boring...,4,20 May 2020,"""Can You Keep a Secret?"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a woman revealing all of her secrets to a stranger on a plane because she was thinking that they are going to crash. The next day she meets the CEO of the company she works for and he is the stranger she revealed her secrets to.Since I did not have high expectations from this movie I was not disappointed. This movie consists of many clishé and makes it boring because you can easily understand what will happen in the movie. Despite that, some scenes were very funny but they were not enough to save this movie. The interpretation of Alexandra Daddario who played as Emma Corrigan was average and I believe that she did not reach her potential. Finally, I have to say that ""Can You Keep a Secret?"" is not an amazing movie but a good movie to spend your time, do not expect much from it and you won't be disappointed.",Can You Keep a Secret
4,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,2,15 April 2020,"Since I haven't read the book, I can't say if it was well represented, yet something tells me that it wasn't. The story was not only boring, but it can make your eyes roll more than one time. The main character was so insecure that it started getting annoying after a while. I mean, she kept saying to him that he is so extraordinary and yet she is not good enough for him, she doesn't worth anything and stuff like that, and he had to constantly reassure her that she was good enough. And even after what happened, somehow she was on the wrong and had to chase after him? Okay... So, anyway, bad romance, boring cheese script and awful makeup and costumes.",Can You Keep a Secret

Bored to freaking death!",1,14 March 2020,"This film start with a girl ""Emma"" talking about her work, and she met a strange man ""Jack"" on a plane scene! As turnout, this film is about Jack accidentally expose Emma secret on a TV interview, Emma thought Jack humiliate her, and Emma eventually forgive Jack's honesty! Entire film full of boring conversation! The director keep showing audience the scene on the plane, make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Emma suggest to copulate with her boyfriend at the archive room! At the end, Emma begging Jack to forgive her! Jack accept Emma apology, and Jack confess his love to Emma!

11,Abdulxoxo,It's okay,6,15 December 2020,"The film's plot Is formulaic and quite predictable, 'cause we know it's only a matter of time before the two leads start a romance, fight and then reconcile and credits roll. The characters aren't particularly developed but are a bit likable esp Emma, the lead character, who is a quirky lady with low self-esteem and is just not happy with her life entirely. Alexandria Daddario did a solid job with the lackluster material she has. The rest of the characters are just sorta there, not developed well and quite silly. And the dialogue is cheesy at times.
But I like the look of the film, and it has the late nineties rom-com feel to it. The score is scanty but when available it's fitting. And the film explores themes that are very relatable such as betrayal, trust, and vulnerability.
All in all, Can you keep a secret? is a poor book-to-screen adaptation, with obtuse script and mediocre direction, but it's light-hearted, goofy and a bit entertaining.",Can You Keep a Secret

13,michaeltrivedi,Sweet,7,11 November 2019,"Can You Keep A Secrety? was a sweet movie. It was nothing to write home about, or even discuss. It was just a sweet experience, that's all I could really say.The movie centers on a marketing assistant who divulges all her inner secrets to the man next to her on a plane that is going through life threatening turbulence. The plane makes it okay, but the woman discovers that this man is her boss. They fall in love, and nothing really more happens. The relationships goes through it's ups and downs, but evens out in the end.I like romantic comedies. The actress was very impressive. She was also in The Layover, which was a really good film. She was in others too, and I really like seeing her on the screen. There's something wrong with her presence, but she's still satisfactory to watch. I'd really like to see her in other romantic comedies.The movie is just an ordinary romantic movies. It's really really nothing special. Just some ordinary love stuff. Working an office job, co-workers, roommates, finding love, etc.It was alright.6 stars",Can You Keep a Secret
14,leftbanker-1,What Lies Far Beneath the Bottom of the Barrel in Entertainment,1,14 September 2019,"This is not fit entertainment for adults. It's billed as a comedy, but the completely hackneyed attempts at humor wouldn't pass muster on an episode of Sponge Bob (which can actually be sort of funny). People acting awkward and stupid in the presence of their boss, like serfs in a medieval village, is painful to watch.The premise is paper-thin: some nitwit coward freaks out on a plane because of a little turbulence and spills her guts out to a complete stranger next to her...but get this, he is her new boss! Wow, I just think that idea should have been left on the cocktail napkin it was written on, but what do I know? It was the subject of a book and a bestseller, further proof than most people have nothing in the way of critical thinking skills.Yet another story that tells us how cool it is to work in marketing and sell crap to people that they don't want and definitely don't need. In about 90% of movies, people are either ad people or lawyers.The only surprise in the entire film, and something I found hilarious, was the handsome guy dumping her after a few rounds in the sack, telling her she is just too stupid and shallow for him. I'm kidding, I didn't make it to the end.Every scene will make you cringe, it's that stupid. As I said. it's not fit for adults.",Can You Keep a Secret

16,rdoubleoc,Not bad.,5,17 September 2019,"Not bad, but there's a lot of competition and I think the story and comedy is lacking slightly. Cast is well dressed and film is well directed and produced, however (it feels like a box office film, just a slightly boring one at times). It's a little more serious than I thought it would be since I was expecting a comedy, also, but it was alright.Alexandra Daddario looks very nice, as always.",Can You Keep a Secret

18,movieman6-413-929510,A well-known romantic comedy filled with clichés.,3,29 November 2019,"Can You Keep a Secret is a new romantic comedy directed by Elise Duran. This is the first cinema film she has directed. She has also revised more episodes of TV series and a documentary.When she thinks she is going to crash during a flight, Emma Corrigan (Alexandra Daddario) tells all her life secrets to the unknown passenger next to her named Jack Harper (Tyler Hoechlin). If she realizes that she has made a mistake and nothing serious happens with her plane, she would rather never meet Jack again.
When she later discovers that Jack happens to be her new boss, their relationship starts to get a bit uncomfortable with the information Jack knows about Emma. Despite this inconvenience, Emma realizes that by being so open to Jack, she is able to make contact with him more easily. For example, some romance is gradually starting to bubble up between the two, but Emma does not know much about Jack yet and hopes that he will also be so open to her during the time they spend together.This film comes across as a standard romantic comedy at a teenage level. This film is coming soon for people who are familiar with how a standard romantic comedy is put together quickly as known and predictable. Although the film only lasts 95 minutes, it still seems as if it takes longer. The film owes this to the well-known and lengthy story.Alexandra Daddario and Tyler Hoechlin look nice in the film as an uncomfortable romantic couple, but due to the many clichés of the story, their relationship during the film loses some of its credibility. There are better romantic comedies that you can watch better instead of this movie.",Can You Keep a Secret
19,Greatornot,Me Too would and should be angry.,1,21 September 2020,"Horrible film. CEO's should not initiate personal relationships with subordinates. This is one of the most disgusting films I have ever seen. The main lady character was immoral as well, the way she treated her bf. Just an awful ROCO with a slew of characters that lacked moral values. The idea seemed like a nice idea for a film, but they veered into a direction that is just wrong on so many levels. I truly am surprised that the METOO movement did not come after a movie like this in of course a negative way; Especially since we have a world of Harvey Weinsteins that need to be exposed if they were not exposed already. I was angry and of course knew the ugly direction this would go. Nothing new here.",Can You Keep a Secret
20,ferdinand1932,Infantile,2,17 September 2019,"In 1941 'The Devil and Miss Jones' was produced. It featured Jean Arthur as a shop clerk who battled sexual and wage inequality while negotiating with a secret boss. It offered some comedy, social commentary and romance. And the director was not sympathetic to the quasi socialist views expressed either. The whole package was entertaining: capable of delivering social barbs at plutocrats, and social division.Fast forward to 2019 and 'Can You Keep a Secret?' has some of the same ingredients but in other respects it is an entirely different piece of work.
The plot hinges on a single indiscretion and the loss of pride, and while loss of face is understandable as a device, it is thin as dramatic material. Other dramatic options are eschewed, or more likely, never imagined.The heroine has the grace and dimension of a pre-adolescent, not a grown woman. This should not be surprising, most of the cast are kid-adults. Consequently, it is not surprising that the film's social targets have the impact of a retweet.The object of the lead's affection is an unshaven chiselled jawed alpha-male type with the charm of an umbrella stand. It is a disappointing reflection on evolutionary biology's deepest drives that this archetype remains.The story is predictable to the point of tedium. Artificial Intelligence should be able to create a better plot than this; in order for people to do something productive with their time.The infantilism of culture has been debated for some time but the proof may lie in this film; where adults are distressed over the things that may fully occupy the undeveloped emotions of 13 year olds. This is underlined by the hero's confessions - to square the shared secrets as children do - which should induce a large yawn.This movie is forgettable but it does make the romantic comedies of the 1930s and '40s look better and smarter.",Can You Keep a Secret
21,bastos,Bad rom com,3,23 August 2020,"I used to say that romantic comedies were my guilty pleasure but these new breed of rom coms with very small budgets and terrible screenplays are beginning to change my perspective. Here every character is detestable, the leads have no chemistry and the whole concept is so poorly executed that it loses any interest. I like Alexandra Daddario but she should fire her agent because her latest movies are so bad that every credit she got with True Detective is shattered by movies such as this one or The Layover.",Can You Keep a Secret

23,LukeCustomer2,I am surprised at the reviews..,8,1 December 2019,"After suffering through some horrible stuff on Netflix I gave his a try on HBO.. and was pleasantly surprised. I liked that the movie fixed some of the issues I didn't like with the trailer. The lead here is a typical millennial working for an energy drink company. After a disastrous pitch of the product in Chicago she gets kind of drunk and boards a plane back to NYC. Taking pity on her, a flight attendant upgrades her to first class. It is there that she is seated next to Jack. She continues drinking champaign until a bout of serious turbulence causes her to spill every secret she has to a total stranger, Jack. (unlike the trailer it is clear this comes out because of her being drunk). Of course, the next day Jack shows up at her company and turns out to be the CEO of the company. Hijinks ensue.The acting imho sold this story. Alexandra Daddario makes the main character down to earth and reasonable while still seeming attractive. She even most of the film tries to look ""normal"" and unglams her character. There is no un-glaming Tyler Hoechlin but his good looks are played for laughs and I appreciated that he tried to play it like a legitimate and competent CEO of a company formost and interested suitor second.For me, the final act doesn't work... the two of them seem to be getting along great and falling for each other and then, something has to happen to put it in jeopardy... well, what it was... wasn't enough to really sell jeopardy. That is the fault of the book but... still compared to the boardline offensive junk I have seen lately this was quite good and I laughed a few times.",Can You Keep a Secret

27,MinistryofDoom,Hokey Awkward Rom-Com,5,8 October 2019,"Alexandria Daddario is, as usual, stunningly beautiful but really ups the awkward dorkiness in ""Can You Keep a Secret?"" Despite it's flaws, and it's hokey premise, it's still a mildly entertaining film, but as far as rom-coms go, it's quite average. Although Daddario pulled her weight well enough, I was far more interested in her quirky roommate played by the very funny Sunita Mani. Also look out for Laverne Cox from Orange is the New Black.The basic premise is that a travelling marketing officer for a start-up gets seated on a plane next to a handsome guy who she makes pleasant small talk with, during a business trip. Upon the plane going through really bad turbulence, and believing that her life is about to end, she spills all her life's secrets to this guy. Never expecting to see him again, they part ways at the airport when the plane safely lands. However, when she returns to her job, she discovers that this handsome gentleman is none other than her company's mysterious boss. He, of course, takes advantage of the situation and puts her through horrifyingly embarrassing situations while knowing everything about her, and how she truly feels about her coworkers.Overall, not bad. It could have been much better but it gets a 6/10.",Can You Keep a Secret
28,stevepat99,A bit above average rom-com with caveats,6,14 September 2019,"A bit above average rom-com with caveatsAlexandra Daddario was totally fun to watch in the role of Emma. Also good chemistry with Tyler Hoechlin playing Jack. Supporting cast, especially her colorfully dressed room mate, and co-workers were fine.The story does go off the rails in the final scenes with Jack saying absurd 'things' on TV.There is a dumb/gross scene of Emma mimicking a sex act in a public elevator. Something 13 year olds might do and so unnecessary.For me, the final scenes demonstrated a key and totally unnecessary plot hole. It goes like this, sans spoiler: You accuse person A of doing something that badly affects you, person A denies it and you reject the denial. A bit later, for no new reason at all, you accept the same repeated denial.",Can You Keep a Secret

The whole things seems low budget, like a cheesy made-for-TV movie. The writing, directing, and acting are all horrible. The supporting characters seem so immature and unrealistic. Then they awkwardly throw in several f-words, silly sexual scenes and lewd references or discussions which just don't play well.

When the heroine spills out her secret to a stranger when she thinks her flight would crash, little did she realize the consequence of her actions when it turns out that the man she confided with was her boss. This premise provided much amusement for the first part of the movie, and Alexandra Dadarrio was great. Her wide, sparkling blue eyes, and goofiness made you immediately relate to her situation. Tyler Hoechlin, who I had seen as Superman in the Supergirl series was great. He was charming, and funny as a leading man in a rom com should be. While we may question the reactions of Dadarrio's characters, this movie is not something deep to delve into. It is just an ordinary lady thrown in an awkward situation, and we just have to accept it as that. Bear this in mind, and you will be entertained.",Can You Keep a Secret

I enjoyed the supporting characters, especially Lissy and Cybill. Women supporting other women is a way to go and always nice to see on-screen. Which made the reactions of Emma's coworkers to Jack's interview the more jarring. I liked how ultimately it was something she took strength from.I also liked the way they wrote Connor. He wasn't a bad person, just incompatible.And I liked the ending, not just because it was happy. But how it was done, what was said.And the acting. Tyler is doing a great job of being perfect but he is subtly infusing Jack with actual character beyond the looks. And it's a delight to see.

Both the direction and the cinematography were kept simple. No complexity at all.

I don't know if he had made justice for the book but definitely not for the producers.Music by Jeff Cardoni was the only admirable thing in the film. It may not be the best but it's good and not odd.The cast members Alexandra Daddario, Tyler Hoechlin and others have perfectly acted out their role but what didn't come out goodiin the film is that the pathetic characters they play.To conclude, Can you keep a secret is a clichéd romantic film that's slow paced and plain with weird characters and cringe comedy.",Can You Keep a Secret

64,BB02,"Charming, but uninspired",4,13 June 2020,"I mainly watched this film because of Alexandra Daddario, who is sadly (just like in ""Baywatch"" or ""The Layover"") the best thing about this unfunny comedy. Apart from being absolutely stunning, she manages to fill a badly written character with life, making her sexy, funny, sweet, adorable and relatable, despite a horrible screenplay. Tyler Hoechlin is not a very versatile actor in my opinion, but he is likeably enough for 90 minutes.And it's not like he has to pull a lot of his acting strings, since he has no real character to portray. His role is nothing but your usual Prince Charming, as you can find him in many romances these days, completely without personality, depth or any kind of development during the story. He has to do nothing but be handsome and smile, as he is little more than a shallow fantasy.The director has only worked for reality TV so far, which explains a lot, but at least the movie looks good. The screenwriter has himself directed and written 2 rather nice movies, but this one is nothing but cliche and overused genre tropes you've seen in a thousand different films and tv shows. The moral behind all the glamour is also questionable and old fashioned.Of course the woman has to be emotional all the time, she is constantly portraited as verry week and full of self-doubt. And in the end she is being punished for being complex, while her one-note love interest acts like a selfish jerk - and she is the one that has to do a big emotional apology in the end, while he simply never opens up at all. He literally does nothing to deserve the girl, but he gets her nonetheless.In the end this is a nice enough movie, if you don't think about the massage too much and can endure stale characters and humorless jokes. Quite ideal for a Sunday afternoon.",Can You Keep a Secret

66,jazebelle,"Nothing other than trash, to describe it",1,17 August 2020,"I've just read several negative reviews of this movie, but still felt like I needed to add more salt to the wound. I will also add that I never read the book and that I probably never will. Sophie Kinsella's stories are just not my type of novels. Having said that, I enjoyed Confessions of a Shopaholic, however (the movie, didn't bother to read the book).This movie was quite painful to watch, right from the beginning. The acting was awful, everything was very fake, as if the actors didn't really want to commit to their roles, but were still willing to make a buck or two. The script was awful, absolutely no humour at all, just a mishmash of scripted dialogue thrown in here and there, and wasn't even timed correctly! To say formulaic would be a complement at this point.The two leading characters had ZERO chemistry. The story line was a bit unimaginative. I have a secret ... my secret actually was rather anticlimactic.Sophie Kinsella's books to my understanding is aimed at young adults, but I have known mid-30-year-olds to read it too. This movie adaptation however, is geared to teenagers or perhaps those in their early 20s. Whilst the characters were meant to be adults, they acted like children, the maturity level was so incredibly juvenile. ""I'm so in love""! after the first date? Does that really happen? After everything we have seen happening in the world today, even those in their early 20s, TODAY know that life isn't made out of rainbows, butterflies and a Disney cartoon.Even if it is formulaic, some extra work could have possibly made this more watchable. As much as ""you've seen one, you've seen them all"" goes, the other new addition to Netflix, Plus One, was SO much better.

Again, not a terrible film but also not great.",Can You Keep a Secret

131,amymayhunt,"No plot, no character development, no point in watching.",5,22 August 2020,"From the initial set up of the film, Emma (said to be the main character) has been thrust into a world of marketing that she hasn't put her mark on. She wants to change the industry but isn't being heard. On her flight back she has a breakdown and spills her fears, desires and dirty laundry onto the lap of a stranger seated next to her. I believe this is due to the stress of the 'plane crashing' and possibly some alcohol on the plane.And thats about all we know about Emma; her character is passionate about her job, she's niave and inexperienced in love and has no boundaries (which is fine for the plot to move forward).The issue I have at this stage in the film is that when Emma, who is completely mortified by her discretions, meets Jack, she continues to act in this goofy un natural awestruck way. If the move had created the idea that she was a normal mortified person who had done this the film would have felt more embarrassing, more real. But we see that she trips on her words and puts her 'foot in it' quite a lot. It makes the reveal that its her boss less effective, as she seems to embarras her self infront of everyone, it was almost bound to happen at some point.A side from that flaw, the film overts all attention from Emma to Jack once he is introduced and the attention is vapid. Each scene demanding his presence but not building his character (or our attachment to him). He continuously uses his position to make her feel she's the lesser and at one point he even jokes about it. Not a direct quote:Emma pleads, ""You could have anyone you want"" Jack boasts ""yeah but I want you."" Jack realises his faux pas, ""Wow that sounded arrogant"".Again, in bed, Emma tells him everything that makes him amazing and calls him flawless and ends with calling herself utterly flawed. His response, instead of comforting the girl he's supposed to care about, was to convert back to why he isn't perfect. You have this niave, inexperienced girl who's now in bed spilling her heart out and he doesn't console her!Hes so anonamous that at one point i thoight the plot twist would be he was in Chicago because he murdered his business partner.Only in the last 5 minutes do we really see who he is when he finally opens up about what his own fears are. All in all, the film needed me to understand the dynamic that the 50-shades franchise created 'rich recluse male wants timid niave female' and we have to understand that to understand why his character development lead no where.I would have given this a 4 but the last 5 minutes redeemed its self.",Can You Keep a Secret

The actors and casting were spot on. I loved seeing all new fresh faces in a movie.My only qualms were that I wish they would have taken more time to flesh out Jack. I would have appreciated back story on he and Peter, I don't know, Tyler Hoechlin, is so much more than a pretty face. The young man can emote like hell and should have been given the chance to do more with the character. Hell, I knew more about the 1st boyfriend than him.Anyway, I will go read the book.

No scene, literally no scene in the movie touched me the ways rom-com usually does!
I think I've lost brain cells watching this.

141,brmcd,"Don't expect, just enjoy.",10,5 September 2020,"So I definitely saw the low rating for this before I watched and perhaps that is why I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. Or maybe I gave it a real shot because I haven't read the book.I wasn't sure how to feel about Emma, the main character, at the very beginning of the movie and I'm not an avid follower of Daddario but this is probably my favourite role I've seen her in thus far. She quickly grew on me and as ridiculous and over the top as many of the supporting characters were, I barked out laughing quite a few times.I didn't think the main characters were poorly acted at all. I struggle with awkwardness in scenes but the timing of the intentional awkwardness throughout the movie was perfect and not senselessly prolonged.This movie was just fun for me and I walked away happy so that's why it gets a 10. Disclaimer: I enjoy campy movies so maybe that number is inflated by your standards. However, this definitely deserves more than the rating it's currently at and I balk at people who expect this genre of movie to be Oscar-worthy.",Can You Keep a Secret
142,natbug80,One of my favorite books,8,1 October 2019,"For a book to movie adaptation, this was so fun! The book originally came out in 2005 and has long been my favorite Sophie Kinsella book, one that I have reread multiple times because of how funny it is. I think the writers, producers & cast did a great job updating this novel and keeping the fun tone of the book. It is not a serious story. It's supposed to be funny and fun and make you feel a bit uncomfortable on behalf of Emma's character.I think that those of us who are familiar with the book, understand this and appreciate this. All the haters who are ragging on this movie are really overreacting: what's wrong with enjoying a movie for the sake of enjoying the story?I read one review that said: ""Her secrets are boring"". Let me tell you something: THATS THE EFFING POINT!!!! Emma spills all the mundane secrets she keeps to herself, the ones she can't tell anyone because they ARE ridiculous, and she knows it. That's the dichotomy: the secrets that Emma shares in a terrified moment were personal, silly and weird, while Jack's secret is incredibly serious and with it, carries a huge burden.Obviously, much is left out of the movie. But they hit all the high notes and retained the moments that made the most sense to the story. Casting was perfect, especially Alexandra & Tyler.",Can You Keep a Secret
143,kemp5280,The book is great- this is not!,1,15 September 2019,"I literally fell asleep while watching this awful movie. It was so, so, so painfully slow and boring. Such a shame because Daddario and Hoechlin are likeable, attractive actors but they're failed here by a terrible script and very awkward, stiff direction. The script is especially sad because it's based on a fantastic book by the fabulous Sophie Kinsella. Unfortunately the movie has none of the clever humor, fast-paced wit and charm of the book. It's a total cringe-fest. AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE.",Can You Keep a Secret
