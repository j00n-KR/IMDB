0,MartinHafer,"Well, the animation was great...",7,11 September 2009,"I was looking forward to seeing 9, as I had already seen the original short film (also called 9) and wanted to see what they could do by expanding upon the story. Well, after seeing this full-length film, I can certainly say I liked the computer generated animation....as for the story, well, it left a bit to be desired. And the problem is that I can't strongly recommend the film, but if you don't see it in the theater, then you'll probably like the film less because the graphics are THE film.The story is set in an alternate reality. While some of the features look very much like Earth, many of the details are different. There's been a war raging and tanks are definitely of the WWI variety while airplanes are of the WWII style--yet there are also very modern holograms as well. As for the leader, there is some similarity to a fascist dictatorship, but this guy sure ain't Hitler, Mussolini or Franco. It's like Earth, but not our Earth. Oddly, while I could accept this, in this alternate reality there apparently IS a Judy Garland and the song ""Over the Rainbow""--an odd blending of the real and the fanciful.Most of the story, you have no idea what led to this ruined world that is now devoid of all life--no animals, no people...not even bugs. Slowly, some of the details of this apocalypse come out...but never is there ever a full explanation as to what happened and why--just a dribbling of information here and there. What you positively know is that instead of living beings, there are a group of very small and oddly designed burlap covered dolls--with very high tech eyes. Why these dolls are there and their purpose is unknown to them, but some are just happy to hide and avoid the hellish mechanical creations that inhabit the rubble as well.As for the burlap creatures, this is a shortcoming in the film. While 9 is the ""designated hero"", he and the rest of them really don't have any personality and a few of them seem like story clichés (such as the ""strong and plucky female""). So, when one dies you are left wondering what made that one any different than the one that was killed moments earlier or you are left feeling a caricature died--not something tangible. No real character development occurs nor are their motivations particularly clear throughout the film. Nor, for that matter, does the story answer many questions at all. So, provided this doesn't bother you and you don't mind a vague story with vague characters, you'll enjoy the film very much--it certainly is a visual delight. If you demand clarity, then I suggest you see another film.",9
1,TheLittleSongbird,Interesting film with amazing visuals,8,23 November 2010,"I found myself quite liking 9. It does drag in the second half and I wasn't taken with the ending, it could have done with more explanation. However, I liked 9 for its amazing visuals and well done atmosphere. The visuals really are the best asset with the backgrounds absolutely incredible. The music was fun and charming too, the script was good enough, the story was a good idea and nicely constructed in general and the characters are likable. Overall, I did like this movie, but it isn't a favourite of mine. It is one of Burton's(who has been hit and miss recently) better efforts this decade though, that's for sure. 8/10 Bethany Cox",9
2,SnoopyStyle,Unique characters in apocalyptic world,7,31 May 2014,"9 is a mechanical rag doll awaken into a post-apocalyptic world seemingly devoid of any life. He encounters another doll named 2 who is thrilled to see a disk that 9 has. They are attacked by a mechanical beast which carries away 2 along with the disk. 9 is rescued from the emptiness by a group of rag dolls. It is revealed that the world suffered a catastrophic war between men and machines. The machines used a toxic gas that killed all life on the planet.This is certainly a unique vision and a fascinating world. On the other hand, the story is pretty confused. There is a good variation among the rag dolls. The adventure is very random. The audience just doesn't have a goal to root for. Without a direction, this is just one chase after another without a foreseeable ending. The ultimate ending makes all the previous adventures meaningless and also is a whole lot of confusing nonsense. The rag dolls are so great that I just ignore the crazy finale.",9
3,Hitchcoc,Imaginative and Not Disappointing,8,20 July 2019,This short film is about the survival of a kind of knitted doll in a futurist world. There is a creature whose role is to take down this guy. There are a series of close calls and some standoffs leading to satisfying climax. We need to ask ourselves what will happen next?,9
4,claudio_carvalho,Pieces of a Soul,6,6 November 2009,"After an apocalyptical war between human and machines, the world is completely destroyed and without human life. The burlap doll 9 awakes without voice and finds a weird object in the middle of the debris that he brings with him. While walking through the ruins, 9 is attacked by a machine called Beast but he is saved by another doll called 2 that fixes his voice. 2 brings 9 to meet his hidden community, leaded by the coward 1. When 2 is captured by a machine, the newcomer 9 convinces the other dolls to go with him to rescue 2. However, 9 places the device that he found in a slot and activates a lethal machine called Brain. The burlap dolls are chased by Brain and despite the advices of 1 that they should hide, 9 organizes an attack to destroy Brain.I had a great expectation with ""9"" and the bleak animation is really great. Unfortunately the flawed and unoriginal story is disappointing, a kind of rip-off of ""WALLE"" and ""Terminator"" together and there are many holes and questions without answer or explanation. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""9 – A Salvação"" (""9 – The Salvation"")",9
5,kosmasp,9 little ...,6,21 November 2009,"We get thrown into a very strange world and we don't get answers to what is happening. Quite the contrary happens, we get quite a few questions. And some people might hate that in a movie. Having to deal with a story were you don't know where this is going. Especially when it's an animated movie as well.The story and the horror (fantasy/sci-fi part or whatever you want to call it) will appeal to a younger audience, who might be impressed with quite a few things from the movie. It's animated nice, the voice cast is more then stellar and the story is good enough. Of course you have quite a few flaws (the main character 9 having quite a few of them), but nothing too big to overcome or that might take away any pleasure you can have from the movie.",9
6,classicsoncall,"""But if you know where to look, these ruins are full of riches.""",7,15 February 2021,"It may not have meant the same thing to viewers back in 2009 when it was released, but watching the film today, it comes across as a metaphor against allowing technology to control us instead of the other way around. That could apply to social media, artificial intelligence, video games, or take some other pick. The scientist who created the machine that ran amok in this dystopian world recognized his mistake in not providing it with a human soul, but how could anyone do that anyway? As with any technology, it's use can be easily corrupted by those who control it, and often with a nefarious purpose. I was intrigued by the idea of the principal characters stitched together from pieces of burlap, something very basic meant to represent the best instincts of human nature. And as with real human beings, the characters here met with failure and success in their quest to defeat the antagonist. Quite dark, but with a unique animated style, this film was not in any way produced by the numbers.",9
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Not Super, But A Decent Film With Good Animation",8,28 December 2010,"I don't know how much of a market there is for animated films like this but as someone who appreciates good artwork and computer animation, I enjoyed it. Yeah, the story is only so-so but the characters keep your attention - both good and bad guys, and it is deceptively involving.The ""good guys"" in here are burlap-looking sewn puppets. Why they are who they are is explained near the end of the movie. The ""bad guys"" are the machines. Yes, this is familiar ""Terminator"" country, theme-wise, but the machines in this movie are brutal and scary. This movie is definitely not for little kids!If you keep your expectations in the ""fair"" range, and watch it on Blu-Ray, you should enjoy it. As mentioned, the story draws you in. On the other hand, if you are looking for something fantastic, you might be disappointed.",9
8,Tweekums,A post-apocalyptic animation,8,29 June 2017,"Set in a world where humanity has been destroyed by the machines it created. Before his death a scientist has created nine 'stitchpunk' little dolls, that we later learn contain aspects of his soul. As the film opens the last of these, 9, awakens. He picks up a device that he feels is important then goes exploring. He soon meets 2 who provides him with a voice before explaining a little of what is going on. Moments later a mechanical beast attacks and captures 2, it also takes the device. Soon afterwards 9 is rescued by 5 who takes him back to the Sanctuary where others of their kind, led by 1 live. 9 believes they must try to rescue 2 and against 1's orders, he and 5 head out into the wasteland. They find 2 but are soon attacked by the beast. 7, who was assumed dead turns up and defeats the beast but things get much worse when 9 plugs the device into a machine. It turns on 2 and takes his soul. The others get away but the problems are far from over; this machine makes more machines; the survivors must decide what to do; do they flee, destroy the machine or try to deactivate it and free the souls of those it has captured?I really enjoyed this film; it looked great with fantastic backgrounds, menacing mechanical monsters and most importantly the protagonists were delightfully imaginative and had a design that gave then a melancholy feel. The story is relatively simple but that didn't bother me; not everything needs to be full of twists and surprises. There is a good sense of threat throughout; some moments may be a little scary for younger viewers especially if it is made clear that the machines can and do kill the 'Stitchpunks'. Writer/director Shane Acker does a fine job bringing his story to the screen and the voice cast impresses as they bring the characters to life with distinctive personalities. Overall I'd say this won't be ideal for younger viewers but I'd certainly recommend this to fans of darker toned animation.",9
9,Quinoa1984,think if Don Bluth were forced to make a 'post-apocalypse' CGI movie... and it's *better*,10,9 September 2009,"Shane Acker has a good career ahead of him. At the least, one can only hope so. His talents expressed here, his first feature adapted from his short film of the same title, are immense and sharp and clear and dark and staggering and other words I didn't have time to look up for this review. He takes a scenario one could be familiar with- entities battling robotic elements in a future or just another time period, a desolate wasteland, a possibility of hope on the horizon- but it's infused with the passion and archetypes of a fairy tale. And even with this there's certain twists, or unexpected pleasures. You'll see a lot of critics talk about the lack of a full story, of the beauty of the animation and look of the film outweighing any kind of story or clearly defined characters. You can take that to heart before seeing the film, but a lot of them may have missed Acker's intention here.These are some archetypes on screen, sure. And one may have seen them in films made by the likes of Don Bluth with the Secret of NIMH or, dare I compare, Henson/Ozs' the Dark Crystal (here the latter's object of purpose is reversed, sort of). But the characters in 9, the ones with personalities, are not complete. The idea in the film is that all of the characters, all numbered from 1 to 9 and called as such, are little robotic creations given life by parts of the soul of a scientist who gave himself up for his creations. Others he made, a 'machine' for it, was also imperfect - so much so that it turned against its creators and did what giant gorram robots do when created with human's own defects. So the characters may appear to be things we very simply identify- hero guy, hero girl, slight comic-relief twins, and the grumpy and ornery older one (#1)- and as it goes on the characters simply are what they are... actually, 1 develops a little more, and in a subtle, captivating way.But if you're going to see an animated film this year for its distinctive style and design and (yes) cinematography and creations and colors out of the netherworld of a glorious imagination - and it's not from John Lasseter's Disney or Pixar - it's 9. And damn the torpedoes is this movie beautifully wretched to look at! One can see why Tim Burton and Wanted's Timur Bekmambetov latched on to Acker and helped him get the movie made as it is: it's a world like Terminator Salvation, only if it had actual focus and a capacity to elicit a terror in its audience (young or old). The little robots themselves are cute in a rough way, and the robots - and specifically what they do to one of the critters when they capture one of them by sucking out their souls - move and react like inhuman things that do what they should and look and feel like the world really has ended. You simply can't take your eyes off the movie, and it's animated with such an eye for original detail.At the same time it doesn't aim directly at adults, albeit with a PG-13 rating. I can imagine, or at least would hope to, that a child watching this and being bewildered and confused and mortified and entranced, just as I was watching NIMH or Crystal, and that's a good thing. PIXAR has its wonders, but to see this is to see the A-game upped another notch in the medium and its potential. There are times I didn't even feel like I was watching just animation. Other times, I was taken away like any good fantasy or fable: in the one little moment of respite, 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' plays on a record and there's peace... until it's broken. It's rare a filmmaker can conjure something like that, but 9 has that in spades.",9
10,Coventry,Terminator 5: Revolt of the Rag Dolls,7,19 October 2010,"Animated movies for ""mature"" audiences are often the most strangely emotional, absorbing and captivating stories ever told. When I first heard about the existence of ""9"" and read about some of the names involved in this production (like Tim Burton, who's undoubtedly one of the luminaries in this area), I had high hopes that it could become an all-time classic in the likes of ""When the Wind Blows"" or ""The Plague Dogs"". Now, admittedly the film isn't the sheer masterpiece I was secretly hoping for, but ""9"" is nevertheless a very impressive and highly praiseworthy accomplishment, especially considering the fact writer/director Shane Acker was given the assignment to turn his own successful short into a long feature film, which definitely can't be an easy thing to do. ""9"" obviously carries the trademarks of both its producers. The odd creatures are typically Tim Burton whereas the grim and nihilistic atmosphere is right up the alley of ""Night Watch"" inventor Timur Bekmambeto. And yet, in spite of their influence, Shane Acker's film has its very own and powerful personality. ""9"" is an at times unbelievably imaginative and visually astounding curiosity with plenty of action and emotion. The story centers on a bunch of peculiar rag dolls, or stitchpunks , and their quest for survival in a depressing post-apocalyptic world. All humanity has been wiped out and whatever is left of the world is controlled by vicious and devastating Terminatoresque machines. The leader of the group, 1, is exclusively interested in keeping a low profile but the latest addition to the group, 9, is eager to discover their origin and purpose of existence. His rebellious attitude gradually influences the rest of the group, but the outside world is a deadly place. The initially convoluted and ambitious plot tends to lose some of its impact and pace towards the final act and personally I found the climax to be a bit dissatisfying. ""9"" is suitable for a wide variety of audiences, but keep in mind that the film contains disturbing themes and quite a lot of macabre visuals. One of the evil machines, for example, has the head of a broken old doll. It's a rather creepy image and likely to upset younger viewers. The voices are exceptionally well-cast, with a perfect balance between respectable veterans and popular younger actors. Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau are ideal for their roles of 1 and 2, and the choice of Crispin Glover to provide the voice of ""weirdo"" 6 is genius.",9
11,michaelRokeefe,Humanity in salvage mode.,9,5 March 2010,"Tim Burton teams with Timur Bekmambetov and Shane Acker to present an awesome surrealistic journey through a ravaged post-apocalyptic world. Supreme animation and steady paced story of a foresighted scientist, who makes it possible for nine of his rag doll creations to come alive in a parallel world to our own and band together in hopes of searching for survivors in a ravaged landscape. Each doll has individually unique skills that will be needed to lay the groundwork for a new and hopeful future.The all-star cast that lends voice to this exquisite film includes: Christopher Plummer, John C. Riley, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, Crispin Glover, Fred Tatasciore, Alan Oppenheimer and Elijah Wood.",9
12,Scarecrow-88,9,9,23 January 2010,"From the ravaged wastelands of what was once civilization, comes small little creations made of fabrics and metals, a scientist's sole contribution to what was once mankind, stitched dolls equipped with ""pieces of his soul""(..they are him and he is them). On accident, ""The Great Machine"" will be reawakened by ""newborn"" 9(..the dolls all have numbers printed on their backs specifying the order they were created)who mistakingly places a circular object into a slot which restores it's power(..this is referred to as the ""source""). The Great Machine, invented by a brilliant scientist as a means to benefit mankind with prosperity, is mishandled by others(..military/government), corrupted and flawed, it was able to function on it's own, creating a robotic army capable of destroying human life. In other words, this giant benvolent machine contributed to the fall of the human race and is now brought back to life, with the ability to build a brand new army. So our little doll heroes must stop it and remove the source so that it will not threaten their world. Those caught by The Great Machine are ""zapped"", their ""life force"" removed and ""collected"" by it.At 72 minutes, 9 just blew me away. I feel so fortunate, so privileged to live in a time when I can behold such sensational, breath-taking works of art. How the filmmakers recreate such a damaged world, bringing these little dolls to life, giving each and every one of them traits and characteristics. This is a must for post-apocalypse fans, essential to see such a world akin to what was presented to us in the masterpiece WALL·E, a specific territory where we see societal collapse, fragments of what was once a city. The clever use of parts such as a can(..for 9 to hide from a rabid skeletal hound-bot) or a light bulb(..used as a device to guide through darker regions)are just part of this computer animated film's charm. I was mesmerized at how the threatening robots were made to resemble mechanical insects. There's just no way I can dismiss this movie..it's heart is in the right place, there's a distinctive vocal message regarding how mankind can contribute to it's own destruction through the misuse of technology, and has adorable characters that are really hard not to fall in love with. Great voice-work as well. A real treat.",9
13,dbborroughs,Very good after the end story who's only flaw is its a tad too short,7,23 September 2009,"It's the end of the world and what is left is truly bleak place. Into the landscape comes 9, a rag doll like creature made by a scientist. Wandering out into the wilderness of what is left from the man/machine war he finds that he is not alone. There are 8 more like himself. Unfortunately also lurking in the wastes is a horrible monster.Sean Acker's expansion of his Oscar nominated short is a visual feat. Acker has created a very real very tactile film. This could be our world tomorrow. Looking at the eye popping landscapes one is struck not only by their bleak beauty but also by a certain amount of sadness as to what brought us here. I think for the most part the expansion works. The short, which basically concerned 9's battle with the monster is turned into something more, a struggle for survival on a larger scale. There is more drama and much more action. The film improves as it goes on as bits and pieces fall into place and tapestry of the tale becomes less and less like anything that has gone before.(For a while I thought this was going to be something similar to other films but in the end I was wrong. Likewise I was wrong about the visuals being all, there is a real story in this film's hear and the visuals are part of the way the story comes across) If there is any problems with the film, its that the film is too short. Shorn of its end credits the film is just over 70 minutes. The running time itself isn't the problem, the problem is that there are several times when the film seems to have left something out, that things have been skipped over. To the films credit the film's world bleeds off the screen and you never doubt it's a real place, but at the same time there are some bumps in the telling in the later part of the film that made it feel like Acker and his crew made a jump based on what they knew, unaware that it wasn't completely clear in the film. I can't explain it, partly because to do so would reveal plot points, and partly because its kind of hard to explain what exactly is missing.Flaws or not this is a film that needs to be seen if you like science fiction or fantasy. Its a spectacular film that really should be seen as big as possible for maximum effect. I think you really will like this. (Hell, if nothing else it may change your mind about Over the Rainbow)",9
14,view_and_review,Couldn't Get Behind It,6,11 October 2021,"""9"" is an animation about a dystopian time in which there are no more humans and only few non-organic beings. 9 is one such creation. He and those like him look like burlap sack material rag dolls with some mechanical parts inside. They appear to be the only living things in existence with the exception of a malevolent robot of some kind.It was hard to get fully behind this one. Without any frame of reference for this planet, it just seemed like another dystopian flick.",9
15,george.schmidt,Visionary achievement in animated fare; thoroughly entertaining.,8,28 September 2009,"9 (2009) *** (Voices of: Elijah Wood, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Martin Landau, Crispin Glover) Awesome animated tale set in an post-Apocalyptic world (ok, Earth, even though it is never stated as so) where the future of humanity rests on the recently energized rag-dolls including the titular novice-would-be-leader (Wood) who wanders through out the wasteland and unites with his fellow denizens to ward off the powerful machinery that has risen up to destroy any living creature once and for all. Visionary in scope by promising newbie Shane Acker (and helped along by executive producer Tim Burton among others) – whose Oscar-nominated short is blown up to full-scale/feature length story – may lack in originality in the sci-fi genre but sets new standards in animation (the tactility of it all is truly amazing) none-the-less. Entertaining and a tad-too-dark for young audiences but just right for adults.",9
16,neil-476,"Not very cheerful, but quite good",8,28 October 2009,"9 was an interesting experience for me. I went into it knowing very little about it, and found myself watching a movie where I genuinely had no idea what was going to happen next.The story concerns a number of small fabric-covered robots which appear to be the only living entities in a world ravaged by warfare, apart from a hostile dinosaur-like machine. When 9 comes to consciousness he is responsible for taking his numbered fellows out of their comfort zone into what turns out to be a quest for their origins.This rather quirky story (and I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic stories to start off with) is visually very striking, set at ground level in a world of ruined devastation and large artefacts (ie. normal sized, but large to these small characters) seen from ground level, some of which are barely recognisable. The idea of having each of these characters made out of fabric (and each with a different type of fastening) is demented but brilliant. The voice talent is also excellent with Elijah Wood and Christopher Plummer being most recognisable among a stellar cast.But beware. This movie doesn't have the heart of a Pixar movie, nor does it have the primary coloured joie de vivre of a CGI feature from one of the other production companies. This rather dark, drab movie, is not aimed at children at all: it is perhaps the first CGI fantasy sci-fi feature aimed at adults and, as such, it succeeds fairly well.",9
17,ferguson-6,You Owe Me a Cape,6,13 September 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. Directed by Shane Acker with screenplay by Pamela Pettler, the influence of producer Tim Burton cannot be missed, with recollections of Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and even Frankenweenie. And the ties to Wizard of Oz and 2001 are inescapable.The reason this one scores as high as it does is purely visual. The animation is spectacular and ground-breaking. Yes, it is pretty bleak, but these are post-apocalyptic times, remember! The details and texture of the visuals are extraordinary.Sadly, I found the story flat out ridiculous and the characters underplayed. Christopher Plummer seems to be have found a second career voicing evil guys ... here playing the frightened leader #1. Jennifer Connelly found a movie she couldn't screw up voicing the near superhero #7 (is it just me or does #7 look a bit heavy - surprised the skeletal Connelly agreed to play her). Elijah Wood voice the chosen one sent by the originating scientist to save the world from his misused powerful machine monster.Religious and evil government commentary abounds, and I found most of it not up to par. Still the visuals are fascinating and I can't wait to see where this animation heads in future, better films.",9
18,anaconda-40658,Not a 9.,5,9 September 2015,"Nine (2009): Dir: Shane Acker / Voices: Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau: Unique futuristic animation about completion. It regards the earth in a ruin after mankind loses the war against machines and little dolls that emerge numbered from one to nine. Nine is adventurous and seeks to help the other eight to win the battle against machines. Directed by Shane Acker with creative screenplay but the characters never really emerge as personalities. Another issue is that the violence may be too intense for children. Featuring voices from Elijah Wood as Nine, the only role in the film that contains any depth. The supporting roles are a long assortment of stereotypes. Christopher Plummer plays this old guy who is overly traditional and has a stick up his ass. He is always debating with Nine and encouraging him to be a self centred ass. John C. Reilly voices a healer but the only thing needing healing here is the screenplay. Jennifer Connelly is way too lovely not to be seen but in any case, her role is also cardboard. She plays a female ninja who kicks ass but she has no personality. Martin Landau also provides the voice of a type, and in this case, the creative area of the mind. The special effects and digital content is impressive but the screenplay is basic silly string intelligent. With a theme regarding mankind's legacy, or lack of it. Score: 5 ½ / 10",9
19,zetes,"Should have been one of the best films of the year, but the script is weak",7,13 January 2010,"Quite possibly the best looking animated film of 2009, with its only rival being Coraline. Shane Acker's visual imagination is astounding. This is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick about a group of robotic sack-dolls fighting to preserve themselves from an at first unspecified thing hunting them. 9, the ninth and final sack doll, is the last to awaken into the world. He starts trouble by being overly curious about existence. Most of the movie is made up of chase sequences, but they're beautifully choreographed. The film should be counted amongst the best action movies of the year. In all honesty, 9 should have been one of the year's best films in a year pretty much dominated by animated films. It has such promise. Unfortunately, Acker's desire to drop us into this mysterious world without much information ends up backfiring on him. The whole thing feels underdeveloped. The characters, most of all 9, are so thin that it's really hard to give much of a damn if anything happens to them or not. The villain of the picture is extremely awesome to look at, but its backstory is just generic sci-fi stuff. And the final bit is very unsatisfying. The film overall is kind of a big disappointment, but it still comes highly recommended just for the visuals. At 79 minutes, it's hardly a chore.",9
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: 9,10,9 September 2009,"Just like how Peter Jackson had produced Neil Blomkamp's first feature film District 9 and I loved that to bits, 9 has visionaries in Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov lend their producing creds in Shane Acker's animated science fiction film, and the result is nothing less than stunning, telling a crisp narrative with plenty of scrumptious apocalyptic styled visuals.In yet another post-apocalyptic world brought about by humans versus machines which had turned against their creators, the land is now barren and the skies completely dark, still smoking from an all out war that left little survivors, save for some curiously designed, hand-made dolls brought to life. Ackers had created nine of such dolls each of distinct design that you can't help but to stare in awe at how intricately they have been brought out. 9 has a huge zipper in front of him, while others have buttons, buckles and the likes to secure their bodies together. In fact, I smell an opportunity here for some merchandising where the dolls could be sold as a boxset.I digress, but these are but some of the most uniquely looking animated characters I've seen in a long while, each epitomizing certain qualities of the human spirit, good or bad. And having these characters are more than half the battle won actually, with even the machines looking terribly menacing despite their rather make-shift appearance, gifted with powers that range from being Medusa-like, to the big Deux-Ex Machina, accidentally brought to life by a curious 9, leaving much of the plot to survival from annihilation.The story jumped straight into the action, leaving you with many questions that will only be addressed as it went on. Which of course is OK to me as it kept things under wraps so as not to bore you with the many who, what, why, how, when, where questions, nor alienate you especially when the animation is eye-popping, and full of kinetic energy that will leave you breathless immediately after each sequence, as if you're participating directly with the characters in their thrill ride and fight for survival.It calls for patience, and only those willing to wait will be rewarded. The back story is something quite interesting, involving a fascist government and a scientist who had sown the first seeds of destruction, which while nothing new since it's been done by other films before (think Terminator and The Rockeeteer even), it did provide sufficient levels of detail to move the narrative forward, leaving room for open, imaginative interpretation. But as I already mentioned, the story just did enough and smartly took a backseat for its visuals to lead the way, which is after all what we're here to gawk at.One of the plus points here belong to the voice casting. With the likes of Elijah Wood as the titular character, and supported by Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, Jennifer Connelly and Fred Tatasciore (yes, 7 because 2 of the characters are mute), at times I can't help but to chuckle that it looked very much like Lord of the Rings all over again, with Wood reprising his role as the chosen one, and their mission which brings them to the heart of evil, having to do battles with whatever contraptions that got designed by the evil chief architect. Heck, his 9 even has a preferred sidekick, and two elders who can't be any more different on polar opposites, and a female warrior companion who chews up every fight sequence she gets featured in.What I also found curiously addictive in the story was how it told of natural selection, where the weak tend to get looked over or disadvantaged, and the strong favoured not only just because they possess what it takes to ensure propagation of the species. I felt it was something quite unavoidable, even for inanimate objects brought to life which are subjected to the same rules and unfair playing field.Beautiful visuals, wonderful voice casting and a layered, engaging plot all make 9 one interesting ride that kept its loops and turns very tight. What more can one ask for in an animated science fiction film, and I like it enough to shortlist it as one of my favourites for the year too. Highly recommended!",9
21,siderite,"Not a terribly original story, but a fresh world and very good animation",8,10 September 2020,"The world (as we never knew it) is over. Machines have taken over and destroyed humanity. As a last gesture, a human creates these homunculi made of cloth and animated by a strange magic. What's their purpose? We don't know, because the man dies suddenly. These creatures are then left to fend for themselves and decide to fight the evil that is ""the machine"". The world is very well crafted and visually pleasing. The story, however, is something you have seen before many a time. The archetypes are there, the scenes of terrible danger from which to narrowly escape and so on.What I thought was the quirky point of the plot was that man's creation ultimately fights another of man's creations. There is no discerning a guiding principle of which should win, since all humans are dead. We identify with the lead characters because they are more like us, but there is no reason why the machines should not take over. The ending of the film, explaining the ""magic"" and the reason why we should care comes way too late and it's kind of soapy.Bottom line: very nice animation, although at times it felt like a Bethesda video game. The steampunk-magic world was also very nice. The story was... very accessible. Overall better than average and worth a watch.",9
22,StevePulaski,Burlap potato-sacks with legs and a duty to fulfill,8,19 November 2012,"Shane Acker's 9 is a film of impeccable beauty and style with a traditional yet pleasing story I can accept. Its characters can only come from the mind of a talented and warped visionaire; they are pint-sized little humanoids that have appeared to be stitched together with tight string, created with the material of a potato-sack, and completed with large metal fingers to mold the compelling character to roam a world that has fallen to an unknown apocalypse. Right before he died, a mysterious scientist creates nine of those rag-doll-like figures, he calls ""B.R.A.I.N.S,"" and let them roam free in the world. It just so happens that we focus primarily on No. 9 (voiced by Elijah Wood), who is given the ability to speak by No. 2 (Martin Landau) before 2 is taken away by a large metal monstrosity, leading 9 to team up with his seven remaining family members (voiced by the likes of John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connolly, and Crispin Glover, and Christopher Plummer as their leader, No. 1) to learn more about his placement on what's left of Earth.9 is informed that there is a large machine in this world, whose only purpose of existence is to exterminate those nine little creatures. The brothers and sisters now must outwit and outlast the machine or have their souls and mind be trapped inside it for good.Immediately, what comes to mind when viewing this film is the incorruptibly stylish art direction. The film was predicated off of Acker's Oscar winning 2005 short of the same name, which only gave a micro look at the macro possibilities that could be done with the concept of nine little humanoids finding their place on Earth in the midst of an apocalypse. Acker could only have gotten professional and artistic support, with men like Tim Burton and Russian visionaire Timur Bekmambetov serving as producers. The attention to detail of much of the picture is consuming, and the atmosphere is tantalizingly fearful, while simultaneously being very clever, kinetic, and speedy.Stylistically, the picture also continues to build off the idea of ""adult animation,"" or creating animated films with darker, more sophisticated themes showing audiences that animation is not just for the youngins. This unique idea lead to 9's success as a movie, but failure from a financial standpoint, being the only PG-13 animated film to come out during the 2009 year and boasting the idea of having a gloomy premise.Many adults will find heart and touches of wit in the story and the very artistic kids (those who can appreciate something like Martin Scorsese's Hugo, or even one of Tim Burton's wildly unpredictable films) are sure to find love and sufficiency behind 9's morose story of tiny characters confined to living in fear and uncertainty for their entire existence. If Acker plays his cards in the similar manner he did here, he could have a long, fluent career as one of the pioneers of slicker, more adult animation.Voiced by: Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Crispin Glover, Martin Landau, and Fred Tatasciore. Directed by: Shane Acker.",9
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,Tim Burton isn't kidding with this one,9,29 January 2010,"OK, all I have to say is that if Tim Burton never did drugs before, I'd hate to see what ""trippin'"" for him is like because this is one of his darkest films ever. I'm a huge Burton fan, pretty much most of his films I very much enjoy, he always has a very unique edge to him that makes him stand out against other directors. So I wasn't sure what to expect from 9, I do know that this started out as just a animation short with no sound and it was very interesting. I'm sure that Burton was just as fascinated with it, so he decided to make it into a full length motion picture. This movie is definitely strong with it's PG-13, it's an adult story with it's dark atmosphere and story. But the thing that I loved about the movie was it's beautiful animation and the way the story is told.9, a little mechanical humanoid homonculus, awakes in the Scientist makeshift workshop soon after his creator's death. He then by a bleak chance comes across a band of ""stitchpunks"" similar to himself. 9 and the rest of the ""stichpunks"" then, in vengeance, must hunt down the remaining machines and their 'master'. Known as; The Fabrication Machine, who was also created by a Scientist that was also their creator. The Fabrication Machine, also called B.R.A.I.N., was the machine to create all other machines and caused the end of almost all life on Earth. 9 finds that machines created during the final days of humanity, are hunting them to take their soul. 9 accompanied by his comrades must face up to the machines and finally destroy them if they wish to survive.9 has some incredibly beautiful animation, very smooth and flawless, it's hauntingly beautiful with this background that reminds me of images that I looked at for my WWII history report. I agree on the fact that animation does not always have to be for children or a family, it can be for anyone and I think maybe that was the best way for the story to be told in this case. I just feel bad for the family that walked in on this thinking animation equals family movie time, because there is a lot of tragedy in the film. But I loved the characters, even though the short was silent which made it into gold, this was still a decent enough script with a strong message that was very true to our society and what we have become. I would recommend 9, it's a very haunting story that I'm sure any film fan will enjoy, just be warned that it is very dark, but it does pay off in the end.9/10",9
24,KineticSeoul,Imaginative but doesn't give off a big impression,7,7 January 2013,"The idea for this CGI animated flick is cool and the execution is alright but nothing all that special. It's like a rag doll, voodoo doll, burlap sack, potato sack looking character on a mission to save earth. And some scenes are cool to watch with machine like monsters that look like they came out of Greek mythology and stuff. Even though this movie isn't even a hour and a half long the background and everything has a bit of story to it. Which some audiences probably won't catch up on. This is a imaginative movie, especially when it comes the the rag dolls personalities and why they act the way they do. But the execution is cool and all but it just didn't leave a big impression. Nor is it all that memorable. This will probably go down as a cult movie.7.1/10",9
25,thesar-2,Maybe the 9th re-write would have worked,3,23 December 2009,"Typically, I would be very pleased with a movie with a run time of under 1½ hours, but unfortunately 9 seems so incredibly underdeveloped, it should be either longer, or end with ""To Be Continued"" Sure, I'm aware this was based on what many consider a superior short film, but given the fact, the makers could expand and develop and chose not to, is probably one of the biggest disappointments of this movie.Don't get me wrong; the graphics, scenery, adventure were extremely well crafted. Too bad I can't be like most of my friends and peers and just go to the movies for eye candy. I demand (for the money spent and time invested) some depth, character development, originality and fleshed out plot lines. To be honest, this movie held none of those. The whole movie felt like it could've been explained in 3-4 three-panel comic strips.And that's sad. There was opportunity here and I really wanted to like the movie more. I wanted to get invested with the characters and story and root for a solid conclusion. (Spoiler – there's barely an ending, much less a reasonable and hopeful finish.) I couldn't root for anyone here. Not one character was original or given enough time to distinguish themselves. You either had the main character ""9"" who is either incredibly stupid, a slow-learner or made out to be a ""Luke Skywalker"" but fails as he lacks a drop of charisma or enough background to care about him. Or you have the annoying and bossy ""1"" who's only two qualities are acting like Dr. Smith from Lost in Space or the ability to show why the human race isn't around. In addition, you have the ""Smart"" twins and the tough chick. And so on.Before you go further and state I didn't get the point to having nine different, uh ""heroes"" or dolls, or why they all had different personalities, I did watch the movie and know why they do. The explanation given doesn't lessen the fact that they were any less creative, original or cliché.Basically in this extremely short cartoon, it's the post apocalyptic future after, YOU GUESSED IT!, a war of Machines vs. Humans. The only survivors are now heading up a new battle: Machines Vs. Dolls. ""9"" awakes and after a half second of learning to walk and that he's alive, he means up with ""2"" who quickly shows friendship but speedily gets taken away. Next, he's thrust into the underworld of some of the remaining dolls and with light speed, he devises a plan to rescue ""2"" with ""5."" But, after a split-second decision, he inadvertently sets off a fast chain of events that swiftly builds a machine that threatens the other survivors.See where I am going with this? You get a jist of a plot-line and before you can digest, you're thrown into the next scene. 9 could've been a much better movie if they gave the characters or story time to breath. Even without this downfall, I still can't fully recommend since despite its yearning to have a ""moral"" or ""message"" it's not appropriate for all ages. Heck, they barely made it friendly enough to have the doll tie-ins at Wendy's.",9
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Run, sackboy, run.",7,21 June 2020,"'9 (2009)' is an atmospheric, tonally complex movie with a unique aesthetic and a fast pace. The thing doesn't have an ounce of fat on it, coming in at a lean seventy-nine minutes, and it strikes an almost perfect balance between world-building and action. In fact, it's far more action-packed than you'd expect. Its set-pieces are all exciting and wonderfully staged, taking full advantage of their animated nature. The same can be said for the set-design, which sees its inches-high heroes stumble around a post-apocalyptic landscape that seems giant in comparison to them. Some of the creature design is properly creepy, too. The flick is rather dark, as enigmatic as it is engaging. A lot of it feels fairly ominous and its stakes, while small, are genuine. The narrative, in general, is rather restrained; it isn't about saving the world, for example. It is, however, interesting and entertaining throughout. It takes number of boldly unconventional turns and satisfyingly comes together for an unexpectedly bittersweet finale. As a whole, the movie is enjoyable and unique. Its atmosphere and aesthetics are decidedly strong, its set-pieces are wonderfully exciting and its messaging is boldly layered. 7/10",9
27,g-bodyl,Visually Stunning!,8,1 January 2010,"I thought that this movie was a good movie. Even though this is an animated movie, it's designed for adults more than kids. In fact, I read that this is the fourth computer animated movie to receive a PG-13 rating. But let me tell you something, the visuals are absolutely amazing. I liked the way how the movie portrayed the post apocalyptic world.The story is about a group of ragtag dolls who must work together to save their comrades from machines that destroyed the humans. This is a great story, but it needs some work. That's the weak point of the movie.I am actually happy that Focus Features made a film like this because I liked the eleven minute short that was nominated for an Academy Award. Overall, this is a visually-stunning film that needs some script work. I rate this film 8/10.",9

32,Dr_Coulardeau,Death is life and madness is sanity,8,20 July 2010,"The world has been destroyed by a war between men and machines, because a totalitarian regime imposed to a mad scientist to build the ultimate machine that could build more machines. The machines won of course. But on that last machine the mad scientist who was not completely mad built a plug-in that had to be brought and that plug-in is working two ways. It activates the machine if it is plugged into the machine or it is the destroying element if it is activated when off the machine. Then he creates some nice little mechanical humanoids whose mission it is to destroy the mechanical folly that destroyed the world. The last of these little technical androids is number Nine and he will succeed in his mission. The details are in the film itself. It is naïve, slightly frightening, definitely sickening about the silliness and gullibility of human beings. It is also full of hope that these little nice mechanical androids who are given the planet after this catastrophe will be better than human beings. Human beings had been created by God and these by a not so mad after all scientist. You can imagine the madness of God who created such an unmanageable species. Maybe not the best of Tim Burton's films but quite a good one, though obsessed as usual with death, which means with life.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",9
33,Rectangular_businessman,7,7,11 June 2010,"I had high expectations of this, especially after seeing the original short by Shane Ackner of the same name, in which this movie was inspired. However, the results ends being just adequate.These movies, despite being a small production, have an excellent animation and a great atmosphere: Shane Ackner creates a unique, fascinating, world. Also the whole cast make a great work with every single one of the characters. Too bad that the story was filled with a lot of silly, stupid clichés, that only ruin the interesting parts of the story: Here you have the ""Chosen One"" that have to save the world, the boring, invincible villain that never and the plain, one dimensional characters that only appear to be killed.Despite that, I liked this film. Even when it is completely predictable, it still is very funny to watch, mostly because of the animation and the atmosphere. The character design was pretty good too. Even when ""9"" wasn't so good as films as ""Coraline"" it still a decent, entertaining film. But it could have been way better.",9

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Best animation outside of Pixar, but an unfulfilling story",7,11 January 2010,"Shane Acker's Oscar-nominated animated short ""9"" impressed on ingenuity and creative visuals. Its anthropomorphic googly-eyed burlap protagonist, 9, connectedly instant with the short's viewers and the wealth of imagination poured into his world and surroundings made it fascinating. With the help of numerous producers including ""Wanted"" director Timur Bekmambetov and legendary stop-motion filmmaker Tim Burton, Acker tries to expand his short -- and 9's universe -- into a full-length feature. ""9"" visually rises to the challenge of expansion, and at 80 minutes, the imagination packed in is maybe even more astounding than the short. Where Acker and writer Pamela Pettler struggle a little bit fleshing out their stitched-up characters. The post-apocalyptic world where machine has destroyed man works in the viewer's mind, but at 80 minutes we still feel like we barely tasted it, even if we really enjoyed what we were able to savor.The greatest addition to a once-silent animated short is the context. We learn 9 was created by a scientist and there were indeed 8 others before him. We don't really know their purpose, but they were created in the wake of a Terminator-style war between man and the machine. At the time of the story, 9 (voiced by Elijah Wood) has awoken and meets 2 (Martin Landau) who is taken away by a robotic beast along with a talisman 9 was carrying. Hiding from that beast are some others who are led by the elder 1 (Christopher Plummer), who believes hiding is all they can do. In an effort to save 2 and get answers about the talisman, 9 and 5 embark on a journey where they awaken the terrible machine that started it all.At this point it goes without saying that the visuals of ""9"" are absolutely stunning. Next to the last couple of Pixar films, the detail and artistic direction for the world of ""9"" are second to none. One can't help but realize the importance of animated storytelling when seeing what Acker does with visuals that just might never have been done with live action. The machines in particular and Acker's eye for exciting action make ""9"" watchable.But any post-apocalyptic story, particularly one with no humans in it, requires a lot thematic meaning. ""9"" never quite gets there with its array of seemingly lovable characters, not doing much to prove there's anything but stuffing and a few wires inside its sewn-together protagonists. The mythology going into this film is clearly extensive, but it just doesn't reflect it because minimal effort has gone into building relationships or themes of any kind. Friendship themes are barely communicated between 9 and 5. It seems all the attention went into expanding the universe, not building it around a theme. The commentary ""9"" offers on humanity comes too little too late.""9"" is a good start for imaginative animated film-making and an even better story as a film. It's nice to see UCLA student's culminating project get looked at by influential filmmakers such as Burton and allow the undeniably creative mind of Acker and his team to make a film few producers would likely let him on a mere pitch. Animation can be for an older audience too, and that's important.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com",9
36,thinker1691,""" I am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds """,10,30 March 2010,"A visit to our recent past is more poignant when we realize our world might have been better off, never having discovered the secret of the Atomic Bomb. However, from time to time, our humanity needs to be reminded of that mistake. Case in point, this remarkable film is called "" 9 "". Created and beautifully crafted by Shane Acker and Tim Burton this imaginative story brings to life a set of characters interestingly call by numbers. Christopher Plummer becomes the voice of # 1. Martin Landau is the voice of # 2, Alan Oppenheimer is the voice of the Scientist and Elijah Wood plays the central hero number 9. The story involves all the numbers trying in their own way to explain their reason for being and the search for an explanation as to what happened to the people of the planet. Watching a black and white reel explaining the emergence of technology by a scientist, they realize it was developed as a benevolent machine who's purpose was corrupted by The Dictator (Tom Kane). However as with most intentions, the machines took on a life of their own and now seeks to destroy everything. It's left up to the numbers to try and correct the scientist's mistake. A wonderful and innovative movie set in one of the dark possible futures of mankind. A resounding success for both Director, producer and the artists who gave voice to the characters. Despite it's desolate, gloomy and black environment, this film is nevertheless easily recommended. ****",9
37,freemantle_uk,A proper dark animated film,8,23 April 2011,"Back in 2005 a short animated film called 9 was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short. Whilst it did not win it impressed the likes of Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov and the two produced the feature length version and gave director Shane Acker his feature debut.9 (Elijah Wood) is a strange rag doll creature who awakes in a post-apocalyptic city. He meets up with a similar creature, 2 (Martin Landau) who discovers 9 is carrying a talisman, but is soon captured by the Beast, a mechanical dog. 9 meets up with the rest of the rag dolls, the cowardly and dogmatic leader 1 (Christopher Plummer) who believes the best strategy is hiding, 5 (John C. Reilly), an inventor who avoids conflict and 8 (Fred Tatasciore), 1's large enforcer. 9 goes against 1's orders and goes to rescue 2, but ends up releasing the machine, a powerful creation that had destroyed humanity. 9 and the dolls have to discover the past to save themselves.Like every critic I am going to praise the animation: it is really detailed, dark and gloomy. The city itself looked like a bombed out European city during and after World War 2 and there is a retro feel about the film, how people in the 40s might have pictured a post-apocalyptic future. The designs of the machines are animal like, made from whatever scrap from the ruins can be found. Some of the designs did remind me of some other films, the Machine's red eye loosing like HAL from A Space Odyssey and the machines at war with the humans are look the tripods for Steven Spielberg's version of World of the Worlds. Acker also get the right mix when making humans look cartoonary, but still has plenty of detail, such as hair and skin pattern: these are not poorly animated wooden figures you see in many animated films. Acker also has a good eye for action, following characters as fight or run and works well with his set and creature designs.Some people have complained that 9 is too dark: but I love it when a film is dark, I love dyspotic and post-apocalyptil fiction. This is not a film for young children, but great viewing for 10-years-old plus, children who like action cartoons and looking for something darker. There are some interesting ideas and I like how depressing the world looked, with cloudy skies, the ruined city and ominous factory in the distance. The idea of machines vs. humans is nothing new, we have seen it in 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Terminator films and the Matrix, but there are other ideas, like the machine stealing souls, 1 looking like the Pope or the Archbishop of Canterbury and he sees science as dark, evil force that brought the world to disaster and sees it as a mystical force. 1 is a symbol of conservatism and wanting to avoid tackling a problem and hiding it away, then just face it. I also like how the machines are more animalistic, just wanting to feed and cause destruction.The voice casting was okay, but it was one of the weaker elements of the film. I quite Reilly, but I think he gave a weak, bland performance. Even more remarkable is that Reilly is a strong comedy and dramatic performer. Wood has yet to escape his performance in Lord of the Rings, be wide eyed, young and idealistic, forced into an adventure. Jennifer Connelly is good as the warrior woman of the group, strong-will and clever, but hell, I love Connelly, she could star in a positive bio-pic about Sarah Palin and I would still love her.I would to have liked to have seen more about the back story about the characters, why they turned out the way they became. They needed to be more information about the characters and show their backstory in some way. Also, despite the fact I love the serious, dark nature of 9, I would have liked a little more comedy, just to lighten things up. There is an old Hollywood saying: ""make them laugh, make them cry"". Even in the most serious films there are still lighter moments, just to break the tension. 9 needed a little more of that.I would not be surprised that the script was longer and that many elements were cut during editing or never even animated. It just needed to be expanded. But I am sure that Shane Acker will have a good career as a animation film maker.",9
38,strong-122-478885,"Any Way You Look At It, 9 Just Didn't Add Up",3,24 March 2014,"Believe me, I'm really trying to be fair-minded here, but, the truth is, when it comes to 9's painfully predictable story, its sheer lack of originality was a severe compromise simply for the sake of an overload of CGI effects.Containing way-way too many mechanical-monster attacks, 9 was the sort of movie that would probably best appeal to people who actually like to have their intelligence repeatedly insulted.This $30 million production (that shamelessly had Tim Burton's name attached to it as an underhanded marketing ploy) arrogantly talked about the ""human soul"" and actually had the gall to suggest that, due to this, its story was so much deeper than just being a sum total of all of its near-endless explosions.I clearly got the impression that lurking behind all of 9's bleak, post-apocalyptic nonsense there was some sort of biblical message in its ""rag-dolls-on-the-run"" story. But I got too bored with this picture to even bother to try to second-guess its ulterior motives.It really figures that 9 was directed by Shane Acker who was also the same hack responsible for Oz, The Great and Powerful.I couldn't believe that Acker actually stooped to using the classic song - ""Over The Rainbow"" (sung by Judy Garland) in 9 as a truly slimy means of hoping to add some much-needed credibility to the worthlessness of this film's hokey, shallow, haywire story-line.",9

40,CubsandCulture,This is how you do an abstract film,10,17 November 2019,"I just re-watched this for the first time in a decade. On the most basic level is a dark whimsical film with striking visual design, a strong sense of pace and movement. The tale, a simple one, largely keeps you guessing. It also avoids the common problem in fantasy of being too exposition laden. And the voice cast is great. This might be Wood's second best performance after LOTR.But the film is truly great because of the story concepts embedded with its narrative. If you think about it there really is only one character in the entire movie and the film artfully explores how facets of ourselves fight. This coupled with some easy to digest bits of man-machine relations make the film have a deeply allegorical aspect that is wonderful to protect thoughts onto.In a lot of ways this is an ideal film to show people at how to do abstract allegorical work on film. The film's plot is straightforward-it is not unlike a fetch quest in a video game-but the visual style and concepts the plot is built from open up a diverse set of meanings.This is a very good film.",9

The trailers made it look very original, and considering it's Focus Film's second animated movie, it seems like it would be good, especially following the amazing Coraline. This was not amazing in any way. The animation and sets were cool, but that's all this film ever accomplished, was looking cool. Cool action scenes and interesting battle scenes, and that's about it.When a scientist eventually built a synthetic brain, it would mean the end of mankind. All that's left are nine little robot/sack creatures and a corrupted synthetic brain that builds other creatures to destroy the world. It's up to these little sack creatures to defeat the robot and save the world.For a movie named after a title character, this movie had almost no character development. There are some individual characteristics, like bravery and stubbornness, but not anything that makes these characters likable or original in any way. The movie never lingers to develop the characters either. The movie is several long climaxes, with only brief breaks to introduce (not develop) characters.The sets and animation were neat. The post-apocalyptic world had a bleak, but imaginative look to it. The creatures all had unique and cool looks to them too. But then we go back to that ""cool"" factor, and that's all that can really be said...that and originality. This was pretty original.Tim Burton's name will be thrown around in the trailers of this film, despite only being on board as producer. This is an original movie, but not particularly good, and it was very, very short, with a preposterous ending, which I'm not going to give away. It's supposed to be a either a sad or happy ending (not giving it away), but with just some thought, you'll realize it's the opposite of what they want it to be.

43,Jonny_Numb,7,7,19 September 2009,"Earlier this year, Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" (based on the Neil Gaiman novel) pushed dark humor and even darker fantasy to bold new places within the realm of animation. Now we have ""9,"" which feels like a continued evolution of the animated film: while the general plot is less than intricate, the dark, postapocalyptic setting and nightmarish visions of man-made machinery contorted into spiders, ravens, and snakes represents a bold step forward for mainstream animation's potential to appeal to a mature audience. The titular character (voiced by Elijah Wood) is the last in a series of miniature animate figures that resemble unfinished ragdolls with telescopic eyes; he awakens to a burned-out shell of a world with no knowledge of where or what he came from. He quickly stumbles upon others of his kind (each marked with a number on their backside), who have spent an undisclosed amount of time in seclusion and hiding from the mechanical monstrosities that await outside. There are stunning action setpieces along the way, complemented by astute observations (that never get too heavy-handed) on mankind's potential for destruction, not to mention what corrupted technology can do to the soul. As a result of this (and the aforementioned gray-horizoned setting), ""9"" is largely somber and lacking in comic relief (there are a few good one-liners here and there), a factor that might alienate some viewers. Still, this is one of the most compelling animated spectacles of 2009, and an encouraging sign of things to come.",9
44,valleyjohn,Better than Wall-E,7,9 January 2011,"9 is a dark and thought provoking animated film that has the real feel of a Tim Burton movie. It's dark , dank and depressing at times but it's also fascinating and highly watchable. 9 is full of Nazi Germany Metaphors and it's story has many hidden meanings ( not that i can explain them!) . It's only 80 minutes long which is just about right and the ending is a pleasant relief from a film that at times can be extremely dark. The animation is fantastic , although i do feel a bit more thought could have been gone into what the bad guys looked like. There are comparisons that can be made with Wall-E and i actually think this is a much better film.",9
45,Seraphion,It's over already?,5,15 January 2015,The movie is just too fat considering that it presents a very complex world base setting. Also there appears to be a gaping plot hole not taken care of by the story about how did the scientist lose all the other eight figures before he make the ninth? The movie is so gloomy that as animation it doesn't really suit the children audience. Yet it's also very short that it may only waste the audience's time watching it. The animation quality is very nice. They are smooth and detailed and one can really say that it is proportionate on terms of body measurements of the characters. The voice acting is at a good level overall. Elijah Wood's voice is nicely very recognizable and he did his part well enough that it gives the character depth for 9. Jennifer Connely did well in playing as the independent and courageous female of the group as 6. Christopher Plummer really completes the group in his performance as the cowardly 1.,9

47,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A film that deserves more attention,7,28 July 2019,"Animated films are no small industry as it once was. After Pixar and Dreamworks hit it big with their films in the late 1990s, several more studios jumped in to try and compete. The thing was though, many were competing for the same demographic. That demographic was more family friendly than anything else. Only recently has the film industry seen an interest in making more adult related animated features for theaters to distribute. A film that would come to mind would be Sausage Party (2016). That though was in the genre of comedy, which needed an R rating. However not all adult films need to be rated R. A perfect example would be this feature film.The story here is about a rag doll labeled number 9 (Elijah Wood), who wakes up in a strange setting. His surroundings consist of a massive wasteland, only to discover other rag dolls like him with other numbers. Number 8 (Fred Tatasciore), 7 (Jennifer Connelly), 6 (Crispin Glover), 5 (John C. Reilly), 4 & 3 are silent twins and 2 (Martin Landau), all led by 1 (Christopher Plummer). Even Alan Oppenheimer has a small role. The difference is, 9 found a green glowing piece that seems to be important. Unfortunately, none of them know what its purpose is for. To their dismay, this isn't their only problem. The dolls are also being hunted by mechanical predators made from animal parts that are seeking though take their lives.The script was penned by Pamela Pettler, the same writer from Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) and Monster House (2006). Seeing that, it is quite obvious where the darker elements to the film came from. For an animated film, the premise to this is far grimmer than some may think. The post-apocalyptic setting is refreshing and horrifying (in a good way) at the same time because how unexpected things are depicted. There is death shown and it's not exactly hidden from the viewers' eyes. Credit needs to be given for Shane Acker who has only directed this film. Since then he has been a previsualization artist for other projects like Total Recall (2012) and 47 Ronin (2013).What doesn't work in the script's favor is the logic behind it. There's a kind of science that is used in this film that doesn't go into great depth. Sure, this film is a fantasy, but even so the idea behind the plot is bizarre. The time at which this takes place doesn't seem anywhere near the current day. The same could also be said for the purpose of the plot. The dolls have a reason for being there, but once it is revealed, it's questionable as to how it'll help. It's really not clear at all, but the voice actors behind the characters make up for that. All of them have moments that feature them in a way so the audience gets a chance to relate and understand the dolls.The animation to this film was well done. While it is unclear how cinematography assisted in this project, Kevin R. Adams was the director of photography. Aside from this, he has remained in the art department. The animators behind the film though did a great job. The rag dolls are expressive and the antagonists they come across are also quite intriguing to watch in their movements. The music however was even greater with its sound. Composed by Deborah Lurie, the score has fantastic sounding music that works well with the action, horror and more emotional moments. She has also composed for Dear John (2010) and Footloose (2011). Luckily for her, a score was released to show just how good she is.While the details in the plot itself and the logic behind it isn't all that believable, that doesn't mean the film doesn't entertain. The voice cast, animation, dark storytelling and the music all help in making this a mature animated film fun to revisit.",9
48,Kamurai25,"""Nine"" is not quite a nine",6,19 April 2020,"Good watch, will watch again, and can recommend.This is a great, and fairly unique dystopian story. The rough setting, hodge podge villains and the non human characters almost guarantee that the story isn't relatable enough for most audiences. Movies like ""Trolls"" tend to rely on an adorable factor to offset their heroes and a more human, if ugly, look for villains.The odd hidden premise is more obvious on subsequent watches and actually makes future watches more palatable.If you come at this movie as a mystery and try to enough the technical aspects of what is happening, then you'll enjoy this more, but I think it's understandable why people wouldn't naturally do that with this one.",9
49,lewiskendell,A fine example of adult animation.,8,21 April 2010,"9 is a wonderful blend of all the best parts of modern American animation. It shares a darkly fascinating and unique art style and a adult story, with Coraline. It has all the attention to visual detail and technical wizardry that you would expect from a Pixar movie. And it has the memorable characters and settings of Corpse Bride or The Nightmare Before Christmas. Even though it's a combination of all these different aspects, 9 is still its own original creation. This is basically a post-apocalyptic tale about small, artificially created beings who are struggling to survive and remain hidden from the remnants of the machines that destroyed the world. The resulting story is sad, frightening, exciting, and poignant. Imagine Terminator, A.I., Indiana Jones, and Mad Max all woven together. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting Shrek or Madagascar (not that those movies aren't fine, they're just completely different), you're in for a treat. Even though 9 is thoroughly American, I can see it appealing to fans of anime like Ghost in the Shell or Akira. There's a similar hard-edge that runs through all three of those movies.",9

52,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Pretty Interesting,8,8 September 2014,"I personally love pollution and hate the environment (I pollute on purpose every day), so I'm usually not a fan of films portraying industrial apocalyptic wastelands as they give pollution a bad rep. However, 9 doesn't carry a preachy hippie propaganda environmental message, actually more of an anti-war message.9 is a bizarre mechanical ragdoll, sentient and smart yet seemingly all alone. He wakes up in a lab next to a dead man, and we soon learn, after a shot is shown of a dead woman and baby in a car, that the earth is no longer home to humans, and as the story progresses it explains that 9's creator was a peaceful and kind scientist who invented large industrial machines. These machines were supposed to be peaceful, instead turning on humans, ultimately leading to the release of a highly deadly bioweapon that wiped out the planet. The scientist created 9 to continue life on earth after the demise of all natural life. 9 soon meets a group of other single-digit named ragdolls, and they try to stop the machines from stealing their souls and murdering them.9 has its flaws, no doubt. Not to get technical or anything but with any disease or virus, there are always several people immune to it. A bioweapon could potentially wipe out a city but certainly not every last human on earth. Of course, it is just a movie, and the animation is excellent beyond belief, as is the plot and soundtrack. The character design is very interesting and original, and the whole atmosphere has a sort of post-apocalyptic Steampunk look to it. Just like Coraline, The Lovely Bones and Felidae, 9 has its own unique style that makes it stand out above the rest. It's certainly worth viewing, and a cautionary tale of the dangers of war and violence.",9
53,dunmore_ego,Sock It To Me.,6,21 July 2010,"Sock puppet apocalypse! First, allow me to register a complaint: Tim Burton's name is bandied about this production like it was his to bandy. Even the intriguing trailers stank of advertising Burton. Tim Burton is one of the producers and his name is for marquee strength only. ""9"" is solely the vision of animator-writer-director genius Shane Acker. Shane Acker. We'll hear from this boy in the future. ""9"" is his jaw-dropping, wonder-making, magnificent animation sight-spectacular, and an ambitious stab at conceptual darkness. Gone awry. The concept is lost amidst this action movie that didn't need to be. A tiny hessian puppet named 9 awakens in a blasted cityscape and wonders at his existence. He meets others of his kind, all with numbered names, and they embark on a journey of self-discovery while facing monstrous mechabeasts with unknown motivations and fatal inclinations. The animation in ""9"" is so unique and the story so strange that it takes viewing and listening to the Audio Commentary to understand the fullness of the world that Shane Acker created. But Acker attempts too much conceptualization and it gets lost. To relate to the motivations of the burlap sock puppets, they must be anthropomorphized, which turns them into little dolls. Which they aren't. We discover the hessians (which Acker calls ""stitchpunks"") are the vestiges of a living soul, the continuance of the scientist's mind who forged them, each numbered doll purveying a different element of the scientist's humanity. The Number P Flashbacks via old newsreels reveal a Terminator-like past, where a useful artificial-intelligence machine was put to evil use by ""The Chancellor"" (no prizes for guessing he's a Hitler allegory), whereby it gained evil sentience, created more of itself and wiped out mankind.The machine is the villain - although I don't like the way ""science"" is offhandedly blamed as the cause of the evil machine, as if science is a religion or a tangible thing. Science is a methodology. Number 1 (voiced by Christopher Plummer) is especially aggravating in his denunciations of science-as-religion; an analog for Dr. Cornelius from PLANET OF THE APES, he is a quivering would-be leader who must create the perception of peril so that others will look to him for ad hoc leadership (much like Dick Cheney). Number 2 is Martin Landau, old and inquisitive, who meets a brutal end. Numbers 3 and 4 are mute tabulators of history. One-eyed Number 5 is John C. Reilly. Stripey Number 6 is Crispin Glover. Number 7 is pretty hot, even without boobies, voiced by Jennifer Connelly (who is a 9 in real life). Number 8 (Fred Tatasciore) looks like Oogie Boogie from THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas. And Number 9 is Elijah Wood.Giving voices to the rag dolls demeans the production. The Original 2005 Short for 9 (on the DVD) features a mute 9 and 5 in a well-structured little tale with great payoffs; it is alien, bizarre, excellent. The feature film is homogenized for family entertainment - and with Elijah Wood as the star voice, well, it's just too comfortable to be darkly enjoyable. I WONDER:  When 7 gets stabbed by a needle, how come it hurts? The hessians have no bloodstreams, no muscles or tendons to tear into; they can't go into circulatory shock. Even 9 gets his arm torn and he acts ""wounded."" Both 7 and 9 are healed - ironically - by STITCHING THEM UP.  The hessians' eyes are apertures, like camera shutters, enabling them to blink. But if your eyes do not have delicate corneas that need to be constantly lubricated, why blink?  The puppets were brought to life through an alchemical process whereby the scientist's soul was sucked out of him via a Talisman into them - explaining how they retain his ""goodness."" The evil intelligent machine goes about sucking the souls of the little numbered puppets into itself - therefore why doesn't it progressively get nicer? A lot of Running and Screaming just to end on a very mundane preachy note. 9's last words - when he is left with a nuclear family of himself, sexy 7 and the raggie twins, 3 and 4 - are ""This is our world now. It's what we make of it."" Well, I guess it's more fun than losing a sock in the dryer.",9
54,vithiet,Great animation and entertaining from beginning to end,8,22 January 2019,"Once again I have to disagree with critics here. The one thing we all seem to agree on is that the animation is fantastic; this has been on my to-watch list for many years and even though it has been 10 years since it came out it's still a visual delight. I don't understand how this lacks story or character development. The setting up of the world is very well explained through the movie and the plot, while not overly complicated was enough to keep me interested the whole time. And considering we're talking about ragdolls in an 80 min movie, they did a great job making most of the characters very distinctive very quickly.
All in all I highly recommend it but not for young children as it is pretty dark.",9
55,jaredmobarak,You forget to remember to be scared  9,8,9 September 2009,"Is it wrong that Coheed & Cambria was playing in my head the entire length of my screening of Shane Acker's 9? I guess that just goes to show how memorable the trailer is or how large my affinity for the band. I say that as an anecdote, though, not to cryptically express how I thought the film was boring—it's far from it. I have not seen the 2005 Oscar nominated short for which Acker has expanded this from, but he has definitely infused enough plot and fantastical science fiction elements to warrant going from 11 to 79 minutes. The soul stealing of the original is ported over, yet the reasoning becomes deeper as the life source's origin of these inanimate objects comes into play. This is a post-apocalyptic world that has been eradicated of humans by the machines they created. A scientist crafted an artificial intelligence powerful enough to advance technology to the nth degree, but as most stories of this ilk go, was usurped by the government to manufacture weapons, breeding violence and the eventual takeover. The scientist saw this failure and did all he could to breathe life into nine little stitched burlap humanoids to hopefully save the planet from complete extinction.The tale begins as the titular ""9"" awakens for the first time, without a voice, and curious as to what he has been brought into. We are as confused as he, unsure of our surroundings, until the window shutters are pushed open, revealing the destruction that once was urban landscape. Adventure ensues as ""9"" stumbles upon others like him, older and wiser, some hiding to survive, others fighting to keep going. A small metal half-sphere, foreign markings on its face, soon becomes a crucial piece of paraphernalia too, both as a device to destroy them and save them. So it goes to these keepers of humanity to bring life back to the dying planet, a task realized while on the journey to save themselves as the original fabricated brain is awakened, ever more deadly than the cat-skulled beast terrorizing them at the start, sucking the souls from their soft, hollow bodies. It becomes a test of time and courage, learning to work as a team and sacrifice everything for the greater good of life itself.To say too much about the story itself will only ruin the nuance and simplicity to what is truly going on. There is always something bigger lingering in the background—stakes much higher than the more evident plot at the forefront—hidden behind the more minimalist action/adventure of these humanoids and their survival. The bigger questions of why ""6"" continually draws the metal half-sphere or even of how these beings came to live and breath will be answered as the characters themselves discover the truth. ""1"" has been leading the way since the beginning, guilting them all to follow him because he's kept them alive thus far, but to what end? Always hiding and running, ""1"" does what he can to squash any opinions of leaving to find out what is truly out there, driving ""7"", the self-made warrior, away to fend for herself and ""2"" to cloak his scientific curiosity and stick with the herd. It isn't until ""9"" arrives that the status quo is shaken up, either from his bravery or from his naivety—making the mistake that puts them all in danger—allowing for the necessity to chose whether to live or die.9 has a pretty stellar voice cast with Elijah Wood as ""9"", Jennifer Connelly as ""7"", Christopher Plummer as ""1"", John C. Reilly as ""5"", and the underused Crispin Glover as ""6"". However, the real acting prowess comes from the animation driving it all. The original short had no language and relied solely on expression and movement, something that definitely carries over here to enhance each being's realism and humanity. It is a dark landscape with great use of light and atmospheric elements. Every action sequence is well-crafted and composed to stay interesting at all times; the machines reminding me of those disfigured toys under Sid's bed in Toy Story. The film really does become even more of a success being an independent feature from Acker alone; this isn't Pixar or Dreamworks with a highly paid staff, just former/current(?) Weta Digital artist and whomever he recruited, with the help of two visionaries in Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov. And how about the imagery shone via ""3"" and ""4""s projector-like eyes? Vintage black and white work of war and history, infused with the machines yet retaining the antiquity of time.Its runtime may seem short, but rest assured that its story is distilled to the necessities without any filler to kill momentum or pacing. Visually stunning and unique, 9 is a great alternative to the kid films generally utilizing the medium. Don't forget that this thing is rated PG-13 and may have the goods to scare some youngsters unprepared for the battles or heady themes. It isn't a movie that works for children with hidden treasures adults can find; it's an adult film holding ideas of technology's future, humanity's fate, destruction and rebirth. I can see Acker eventually moving into live action as the storytelling is there as is the direction to hold an audience's attention by being inventive and interesting. Even his use of sound excels due to one short moment of music, a climatic scene changing from relieved joy to scared trepidation in a heartbeat, all while ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" plays on an old Victrola; a beautiful juxtaposition indeed, and just one of many in a film smarter than appearances may initially infer, full of heart and hope for the future.",9

57,MrGKB,Eminently satisfying apocalyptic parable...,8,1 February 2010,"...brought to you by the likes of Tim ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" Burton and Timur ""Day Watch"" Bekmambetov, ""9"" is the brainchild of up-and-comer Shane Acker, based on his previous animated short of the same title. With accomplished voice talent from the likes of Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, and Crispin Glover, along with a fine score by Deborah ""Mozart and the Whale"" Lurie, and simply awesome animation work from Starz Animation and Attitude Studio, this dystopian feature is far better than its U.S. box office performance would indicate.Acker's story may feel overly familiar to some, which is no real surprise in a culture currently dominated by a strong undercurrent of helpless fear and apocalyptic yearnings, but ""9""'s seamless and strangely beautiful landscapes of devastation and loss are so compelling that this viewer, at least, was easily able to forgive the occasional overused tropes and stereotypes. There's more than enough substance in ""9"" to raise it above the mere enjoyment of style.I won't bother with a plot summary; others have done that here. What I will say is that Acker and scripter Pamela ""Monster House"" Pettler have fashioned a fine little cautionary tale that brings resonance to the characters, allowing the viewer to identify with the titular lead and the disparate others that he meets, a feat that--in recent memory anyway--only ""WALL-E"" has achieved in the field of animate machines. I look forward to whatever Acker has in store for us next.Highly recommended.",9
58,fwomp,Absolutely Hypnotic!,10,21 January 2010,"There are so few times in life when a piece of entertainment can literally enrapture you that when one does come around, you wonder how you lived so long without seeing something like it. And this was my experience with 9, a single digit movie based on a single digit 11 minute short film of the same name, both directed by young genius Shane Acker.The 11 minute film 9 was nominated for an Oscar in 2006 for Best Short, but didn't win. But it did get the notice of Tim Burton, who had fallen in love with Acker's idea and world. He wanted to see more of 9's bizarre existence and so, in true entrepreneurial fashion, they went out and did just that.I have to admit here that I'd never heard nor seen the original 2005 short upon which this film was an extension (you can now view the 11 minute version on YouTube so that's not a problem anymore). But after watching this, I IMMEDIATELY searched out the short film. Amazing. What's more amazing is that Acker took years and years to develop his work – and the technology – in order to give the burlap sack-like characters a sense of computer reality unrivaled before or since. And, if it is possible, even more amazing, I found it's visuals to be of a higher standard than the new AVATAR film everyone is raving about. Yes, they are THAT good. Every frame of this 79 minute film is brilliantly colored, muted and darkened. Looking at it, one gets a sense of near hypnosis, unable to pull their eyes away from what is, in every sense, wondrously appealing ...in a dark and dreary sort of way.What else draws you in is the world that surrounds these nine characters. The simplicity (if you think about their names, 1 - 9) is perfectly formed from the beginning. The dangers aren't unique to human history, but to non-humans, this is a weird existence. The surrounding world is a mesh of alternate reality and, yet, familiarity. Songs such as ""Over The Rainbow"" play on ancient phongraphs while WWII weaponry bombard our heroes alongside advanced robots. Tell me that's something you've seen before?! The voices actors were perfect choices, from Elijah Wood (LORD OF THE RINGS) as the title character 9, to Christopher Plummer (INSIDE MAN) as 1. Plummer's distinctive voice added a darker quality considering his past acting efforts ...which pulled the story up even further in my eyes (and ears).What else should surprise viewers is that the film cost a measly $33 million to make and is only 79 minutes in length. Whereas things like Avatar cost significantly more and run three times as long.If you really want to be transported to another world, and see what it might be like to view it from the eyes of strangers, don't look to Avatar, look toward 9. You won't be disappointed. I promise.",9
59,Animany94,The world is dead except for...,9,4 May 2018,"9 voodoo dolls and a whole lot of terrifying machine monsters in a city of ruins. Yeah, it is a truly dark, bleak and at times making your heart pump a little faster when those machines get close-up shots or our main characters are chased by them. The highlight of the movie is its unique visual style and the designs on the machine monsters . The desolated environment is surprisingly detailed preventing it from being just a pile of bricks but actual ruins. Despite an at times sporadic narrative and a story of technology taking over the earth we have heard many times before, I liked the twists and turns it took here and there. The dolls' collective backstory was especially interesting and added just what was needed.Not for younger viewers, but one worth checking out with your older kids if you like these kinds of bleak movies.",9
60,ajs-10,Beautifully made but slightly flawed...,7,24 September 2010,"Set in a post apocalyptic world where all life on Earth has been wiped out by machines, or rather one machine in particular. This film focuses on the efforts of a group of inventions, numbered 1 to 9, who try to redeem the scientist who made both them and the machine that destroyed the world. The machine has been dormant for many years, but one of its progeny, a mechanical cat-like creature protects its lair and takes anything that moves into it's area.9 was the last of the scientist's inventions, but he didn't have time to animate him before he died. All of the previous inventions, 1 to 8 had already been released into the world. So we begin with 9 falling to the floor and becoming sentient. He explores his surroundings, the remains of the scientist's lab, and finds a small device that he seems to think is important. He looks outside to see another like himself, but he is unable to call out, so he goes outside, taking the device with him, where he eventually finds 2 who gives him a voice. 2 tells him of the war, and how the machines had wiped out all life, apart from the 9. At this point they are attacked by 'the cat' who takes both 2 and the device back to its lair. 9 is now alone again, but is found by 5, who takes him back to the sanctuary where 1, 6 and 8 also live. 9 persuades 5 to help him go after 2. They battle with 'the cat', which is finally destroyed by 7, who luckily turns up at the last minute. 9 finds a socket that the device fits into, unfortunately, that socket is on 'the machine'! This is where things get pretty intense for our heroes.A beautifully made film with, I thought, a wonderful visual style. Decent performances from the voice talents of Christopher Plummer as 1, Martin Landau as 2, John C. Reilly as 5 Crispin Glover as 6, Jennifer Connelly as 7, Fred Tatasciore as 8 and the radio announcer and Elijah Wood as 9. The film did have some quite scary moments and some of the themes were quite grown up, so I wouldn't recommend it for small children. The producers include Tim Burton, whose work I shouldn't have to mention and Timur Bekmambetov, who has previously worked on Wanted (2008), Night Watch (2004) and Day Watch (2006).Having already seen this at the cinema it was interesting to re-watch it on TV. For me I felt it was better the second time around. I had a better understanding of the plot and could focus more on the quality of the animation and the score, both of which are excellent. I have given it the same score I gave it first time around because, although not perfect and yes, there are som plot holes in it, but I still quite like this one. Over all, recommended.My score: 6.8/10",9
61,itamarscomix,Disappointingly Decent,5,2 January 2012,"My biggest disappointment when watching 9, though I knew it was coming, was barely fifteen minutes into the film, when 9 was finally able to talk, he opened his mouth and Elijah Wood's voice came out, the most generic, All-American, goodie-two-shoes man-boy voice you could possibly imagine.Which is the one and only thing that didn't allow me to enjoy 9, at all. It's not exactly a bad movie; but while the original short was fresh, surprising and haunting, the expanded adaptation is mundane and mediocre beyond belief, which is epitomized most of all by the bad dialog and voice acting. While the original short featured a mute protagonist who spoke and expressed with every motion of his body, Shane Acker clearly realized that to make the feature film profitable it needed dialog and attractive stars, but he didn't really know what to do with them. which is why we got top actors not really doing much acting. At times the character and voice actor expressed completely different emotions at the same time. The entire speech element, actually, felt to me like it was tacked on at the last minute.That feeling of disappointment lingered on for the remainder of the film. Some of the qualities of the short, especially the animation and gorgeous design, were maintained, but the full-length feature offered nothing to make the expansion worthwhile. The simple, symbolic plot of the original was expanded into a myth with history and internal logic that doesn't really add much, and it's filled with clichés right out of a Disney film; the design, too, has been smoothed down, and to me at least felt much less interesting and impressive than the rough, ragged look and feel of the original.Not a horrible movie by any means, you might enjoy it if you're looking for an adventure film with some action, some thrills and some unusual designs, but it's sadly very far from its potential.",9
62,MihaiSorinToma,A very atmospheric dark animation,9,27 December 2017,"Set in a post-apocalyptic world where machines have turned against humans and won the war, this animation presents a scientist's idea of life in a desolated and dangerous world. He created live dolls which are to continue the human legacy and try to survive while being hunted down by a giant machinery, simply called ""The Beast"". We watch the adventures of a doll called 9 in its attempts to get rid of the enemy, while uncovering, step by step, fragments of the past which ultimately led to the human extinction.It's sober and emotional, without relying only on combat and spectacular scenes to tell its story. It's slow paced, but not in a bad way. With this approach, it is able to better describe its characters and their actions, while creating an atmospheric environment. As a downside, it tends to become boring from time to time, resulting in a big 9* for the movie ""9"", released on 9/9/2009. What a coincidence!",9

Machines turning against their makers has been around since at least H.G. Wells, and the dolls themselves are stitched together and brought to life by electricity a la Frankenstein. You will also find yourself referencing Harry Potter and Red Planet (or Prometheus).On one level this is a story of plucky underdogs banding together to fight for a worthy cause. On another level it is a meditation on humankind's folly. The problem is these two elements don't gel. Kids don't get it. Adults are not challenged enough by it.The visuals are great, but narrative-wise it is a string of battle sequences topped with a predictable and disappointingly Creationist ending.",9
64,ersinkdotcom,Pretty cool movie,8,9 September 2009,"The first time I heard about 9 and found out that Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov were co-producing it, I was absolutely on board to see it. Anything that the guy who directed such quirky masterpieces as Beetlejuice, Batman, Mars Attacks!, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow got behind had to be worthy of my time. And then you add the genius of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov to the mix and to me it was a no brainer. I was going to see this movie. Burton AND the guy that has brought us such visually complex and action-packed fare as Wanted, Night Watch, and Day Watch supporting a movie? It had to be good.And it was. Director Shane Acker borrows maybe a little more than he should have visually from other such apocalyptic films like Terminator and even Wall-E, but it doesn't end up hurting the film by any means. The scenery and landscapes of the film are beautifully crafted and set everything up for a certain feeling of loneliness and hopelessness. It's more graphic and suspenseful than any children's or youth feature you would take your kids to, so definitely don't let the fact that this is animated fool you. This is not for the little ones.The voice actors all put their best foot forward and deliver. You've got Elijah Wood as 9, once again convincingly leading a group of survivors in what seems to be an unwinnable war against a much larger foe than they could be expected to defeat. You've got Christopher Plummer playing 1 as an interesting paranoid ""keeper of the secrets"" which reminded me of the Dr. Zaius character in the original Planet of the Apes films, if you've seen any of those. Legendary actor Martin Landau plays 2, who is a scientist and fixes 9. Then there's Jennifer Connelly, who plays the strong-willed and rebellious 7 who has left the core group of ""stitchpunks"" to get away from under all of 1's rules. Last but not least, you've got Crispin Glover playing the slightly obsessed and seemingly crazy 6 who has been drawing strange symbols since the big war between the humans and machines.The film had an interesting plot that got a bit more complex in the end. Part of the complexity had a spiritual vibe to it that I didn't necessarily care for. It just seemed almost out of place and like the director was stretching for something that would make the film more ""sophisticated."" I was not disappointed in the movie by any means. It was a visually striking piece of film. It was action-packed and fun without dumbing down the story or sacrificing it. If you're into sci-fi, apocalyptic thrillers, and animation I would highly recommend this.",9
65,Likes_Ninjas90,It is extremely difficult to recommend this for anything other than its terrific visuals and art direction,5,15 December 2009,"9 was originally a short film directed by Shane Acker, in which the main characters did not speak. Acker's feature film, which was produced by Tim Burton, expands on his original work and is set in an alternate universe, presumably after the First World War. Before he died, a scientist developed tiny mechanical androids that were created in representing parts of his personality and each was given a number. 9 (Elijah Wood) awakens one day to find a powerful glowing talisman and he is chased by a giant spider-like robot. 9 is saved by fellow android 2, but his rescuer is then captured by the beast. 9 is taken in by a number of other androids who are also tagged with numbers, including 1 (Christopher Plummer), a cranky, elderly android, dressed like a bishop. Against the wishes of 1, 9 with the help of 5 (John C. Reilly), ventures across the battlefields to rescue 2 but in doing so, he unleashes something more dangerous.In a year of outstanding animated pictures, from Pixar's touching adventure Up to the hilarity of Mary and Max, a film like 9 really fails to standout. This is not an original or exciting film but rather a highly generic action adventure, light on story, characterisation and development. At a mere 79 minutes the film never has a chance to really develop itself into anything substantial. Yet at the same time, given the lack of intensity and originality with the action, the brevity of the film is actually rather welcoming. One aspect in which the film does excel though is in its visuals and art design. The desolate wastelands are wonderfully detailed with debris and rubble to echo both past and current warfare. The giant spider robots too are a hideously fierce opponent and quite an awesome sight, adding to the grand spectacle. They would probably be far too scary for younger viewers though as this is a much darker film than a lot of other animated pictures in both its aesthetics and its tone.Given the talent in the voice cast, from Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly and Christopher Plummer, it is a shame that the film's script is so lacking in both originality and depth. The story amounts to little more than a very standard adventure film that is unconcerned about exploring or developing its characters in a particularly thoughtful way. The voice actors are largely wasted because of the stilted and generic dialogue that thoroughly limits our interest and emotional attachment to them. 1 is perhaps the most interesting character because of his cruelty and his antagonism towards technology. The rest of the characters though are utterly bland and any form of character development is both formulaic and predictable. The world too that Acker has visually defined becomes a fairly hollow one, with little insights. The most interesting aspect of the world, the allusions to the First World War, are limited to flashbacks with glimpses of mustard gas and the battle between man and machines. The killer robots are a relatively obvious metaphor for the introduction of armoured tanks in warfare. As with the rest of the film though, these elements are of the simplest form, never reaching any intellectual or emotional depths. Only the sight of a cathedral burning up in flames as it reflects in the eyes of 1 is a particularly memorable image.9 is a film that fails to be memorable or particularly enjoyable because amidst so many cleverer and inventive animated pictures, this feels incredibly lazy and generic with its storytelling and narrative. It fails to make us feel or care and becomes a brief and ultimately passive experience. With more effort towards the screenplay and more attention paid to the back-story and character arches, this could have been a reasonable film. Currently though, it is extremely difficult to recommend this for anything other than its terrific visuals and art direction.",9
66,djurrepower,cool vibes,6,29 October 2021,"Interesting premise and an original disign. But the story overall was a bit lacking, and most characters aren't that interesting. So all in all, cool vibes, but not that much of substance.6/10: sure.",9
67,Imdbidia,"Beautiful mood, poor story",6,25 February 2011,"A visually impacting movie and concept with a poor storyline.I loved the retro-futuristic apocalyptic look of the movie, he moody colors, the attention to the detail in the creation of the settings and characters. It is a really creative animation, very artistic and innovative. The dubbing is excellent, too, especially the voices of Christopher Plummer and Martin Landau.I missed an original script to match that beauty. It is such a pity that the terrific visual work is drained down by such a dull and unoriginal script. I think the general idea is good, it is just the development of the same what fails as it has too many stereotypes and known elements to make it interesting. That would have not even mattered if the movie had had a little bit more of heart and soul, which is what exactly the little numbered characters are supposed to be.I though that the short film from which this movie departed was much more daring than the movie is. There, the main characters are mute, not the whole film, so the facial expression changes completely. The short has a twist and eeriness that the film does not. I think the full-length movie should have followed that path, had mute characters, and find more inventive ways to narrate visually the bits related to the pre-apocalypse events as this would have appealed more to the adult viewer, which is the target of this film, not children.Still, this is an OK movie.",9
68,SquigglyCrunch,I Wanted to Love This Movie So Much,5,19 September 2015,"I remember my brother and I being so stoked for this movie as kids. When it finally came out on DVD we were disappointed. Years later I watched it again, and found I was even more disappointed. 9 had a fantastic idea. I wanted to love it so much because of this. I mean, sackboys surviving in the apocalypse? That's pretty original. I've never heard of anything like it. Unfortunately, it was unable to carry out it's fantastically original idea. The story was lacking and the plot was quite formulaic, it felt like Shane Acker had a good idea and nothing more. No direction or idea of how to push these characters through 79 minutes without it getting too boring. Which brings me to the characters themselves. The characters are cliché, formulated around the average cast of characters that are used in a lot of movies. The badass female, the big strong man, the greedy king, the geek, the cripple, the neutral lead, etc. There's really not a whole lot in terms of characters, and although I found some points of peril (specifically near the end) to be rather distressing or sad at points, I never felt like I truly knew or cared about the characters. Overall, 9 was a cool movie. With a fantastic idea, an equally fantastic artistic design, and enough character development for you to care at least a little, it's worth checking out. Unfortunately it suffered from unoriginality in plot and relatively flat characters. That's not to say that formulaic movies are bad, but some just make it too obvious, and this was one of them. I give it extra points for its idea and art, but when it comes down to it, 9 is severely lacking. I would've said its nothing special but it truly is special, it just didn't know it. I'd love to see a re- imagining/reboot of this movie in the future, but chances are that won't happen. Check it out though, it's not great, but it's worth a watch.",9
69,elicopperman,Tis an Adequate Apocalypse,6,11 May 2018,"In 2009, animator Shane Acker released a feature film adaptation of his UCLA student film, 9, co-produced by Tim Burton and released under Focus Features. What looked like a generally dark and mature animated feature ended up getting swept under the radar due to mixed reviews and an underwhelming box office performance. Upon watching it for the first time almost ten years after it was first released, I can definitely say it was a unique attempt at tackling mature themes in an animated feature....if only the film were much more than what it ended up as.In terms of praises, the visuals really help recreate the post-apocalyptic world the film is set in. Everything looks tragically grim, and the muted color scheme adds a lot of depth and subtle details to how the world ended up. What's also neat is the way the animators worked with the main characters, considering that they're rag dolls and their designs and movements feel accurate to how any given doll would be displayed if real. The effects animation is also well crafted, mainly given how mysterious it looks and by how even smoke can be a deadly toxin to anything in the world. Sometimes the animation does look a little mediocrely rendered, but the overall spectacle more than ever makes up for it.As for the story, it centers around these remaining rag dolls in a post apocalyptic world caused by a war between man and machine. All these dolls have numbers stitched on them that were done by their creator, including the main protagonist 9. Upon encountering one of the others named 2, 9 discovers a disk hidden in him containing three unique symbols on the front, which may be the last hope for humanity to survive. While the exposition of how the world got to the way it was is perfectly set up, the actual story is rather straight forward. It's a simple tale of good versus evil of the rag dolls trying to fight back against the machine that ruined everything, and it's not hard to figure out what's going to happen. Granted, the film does contain some pretty tense action sequences and thought provoking ideologies here and there, but the overall plot comes off as rather weak.Adding in to that, the characters could have been some of the greatest characters in any given animated feature, but they come off two dimensional at best. 9 is the bighearted and intelligent albeit curious one who seeks the truth in the history of his creation, 1 is the cowardly arrogant self-appointed leader who demands loyalty from all, 5 is the caring ""common man"" who always tries to play the peacemaker, 7 is the rebellious risk taking fighter, 6 is the artistic one who sees things the others don't, 8 is the brawn nitwit, and 3 and 4 are the twins who detail history from their eyes. While they have their own distinct characteristics, they just aren't given enough development throughout the course of the film. If anything, the villainous machine known as B.R.A.I.N. is more developed given its backstory and the horrible tragedies that became of it which led it to nearly destroy the whole world. While the characters aren't by any means unlikable, they just aren't interesting enough to stick out beyond their basic traits.That being said, the voice-acting is quite decent. While famous actors voicing animated characters has become a polarizing trope in animation, each voice actor gives each of their characters distinct voices and personalities to the point where you forget that they're even voiced by the likes of Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Crispin Glover and Martin Landau. My personal favorite would have to be Reilly as 5, as he actually elevates the character's bighearted persona better than the two dimensional story does. Plus, how can one not love listening to Fred Tatasciore voicing anybody, whether it's only vocal effects or actual dialogue?Overall, while I admire 9 for trying to take a risk with haunting and thought provoking themes such as machinery ruining mankind and rag dolls coming to life and trying to find their origins, it could have used a little more depth and substance to make itself into a great feature. Sure the concept is all there, it is well animated, and the voice talent is spot on, but the underwhelming characters and somewhat routine plot keep the film from rising above being simply ok. I'd say if you're really interested, check this one out. You might not get much out of it, but it will offer some creepy subtext and a potentially horrific world for any given media. It may not have gotten a 9/10 (see what I did there), but it's still impressive to see its director make the leap from short film to feature film nonetheless.",9

Wasn't sure of what to expect,but I'm kinda glad a stuck with it...yes, it has a message that is subtle yet not so subtle at the same time. Humans are their own worst enemy ever, yet throughout the movie there is a grain of hope. 9 possesses the scientists soul, with all the dreams and wishes that went with it. All through the flick he and his fellows resist the machines that humans before them had created to win wars. These machine monsters remind you of Tim Burtons work really. It tends to drag a bit, but if you watch along those times, even then the message seeps into your conscious mind.9 has some very well done cgi blended into a rather sad yet delightful story. I personally think it should have won some praise when it came out...",9
71,judywalker2,"Too much for kids, not enough for adults",5,14 September 2009,"I went to see 9 with great anticipation because the trailer was so interesting and the initial reviews (before opening day) were good. Sadly I was disappointed. This movie is too scary for kids and not interesting enough for adults. I agree now with the critics who thought that the visuals were interesting but the story was not imaginative enough for the world that was created and the characters not fleshed out enough. Again this movie suffers, just like the majority of movies in recent years, from lack of good, imaginative screen writing. Seems that all of the good writers have gone to television, including cable. May Hollywood should go looking for stories there. Too bad it had such potential. Now it will live on in animation limbo.",9
72,moviemanMA,When dolls rule the world,6,17 September 2009,"9 is like The Matrix meets Toy Story. The world is now overrun by machines and mankind has only one hope: a rag doll. The doll is named 9, voiced by Elijah Wood, and he holds the key to destroying the machines, only he doesn't know it. He ventures out into the world and finds the other dolls lead by 1, voiced by Christopher Plummer, one of the only good voice acting performances in the film.What ensues is an adventure through the post apocalyptic streets and buildings to find answers, destroy the machines, and ultimately survive. It's full of creative contraptions and very detailed settings, but all together the film just didn't appeal to me.Something about knowing that mankind fails in trying to overcome the machines was an immediate turnoff. We must now forget about ourselves and focus on what these rag dolls can do. It's almost too unbelievable for this story to happen. We are never really given a timeline for this, but some of the technology looks pretty intense while other parts are somewhat old fashioned. It's like looking at the future from a previous decade. Another thing about the story is the overused ""man vs. machine"" war. Granted nothing like this story has ever been put to screen before, there are a lot of similarities to other stories of this nature.The production as a whole was fairly decent. The animation was very good and the camera work was of the same quality. The settings were realistic enough and the atmosphere was right. The characters fear was almost palpable at times.The voice acting left something to be desired. The cast included Wood, Plummer, John C. Riley, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, and Crispin Glover. They were effective in certain scenes and the opposite in the next. The voices didn't seem quite right depending on the situation or the mood.Overall it's a fair attempt at an animated feature. For director Shane Acker, it's a good first feature. It's based off of his Oscar nominated short of the same name, an impressive short film. I have seen much worse from the animated feature department. This runs somewhere in the middle. It's a cute movie with a dark side that kids might be scared of but young adults could enjoy.",9
73,blackmamba99971,Interesting look,10,22 November 2010,"Not bad for a survivalist film. To see a rag doll with the soul of one man who created him. Or in fact nine dolls with each a unique quality of his soul in different parts. It was an interesting plot where the human race has finally destroyed themselves with their own short sightedness. Creating machines that do their bidding and ultimately betrayed by the very machines to bring the human race to extinction. Yet in the after math these dolls have to rid the world of the very few machines left in order for real peace to prevail. In the middle is nine, a doll with bravery in every stitch he was created with. To stop a beast which uses a talisman to absorb what is left of the scientists soul in each of the dolls. With the help of others, he realizes the truth and soon quells the machine which the world can do without. This was a good movie, it has action, emotions, fear, and a machine with no mercy or emotions. An all round good cast and good music score. Excellent computer graphics which shows the emotions down deep in each doll. Who says toys have no feeling. And with nine, the machine got to know what real devotion is. And how to help his friends.

76,jamiedarlow-37510,'Sometimes fear is the appropriate response.',7,5 April 2020,"Inventive and dark, 9 is a family film with an edge that's worth a watch if you fancy something a bit different. It follows a group of rag dolls created by a scientist in a post-apocalyptic world; humanity is now extinct and machines have taken over. It's up to these small heroes to try and find peace in a dying world. Shane Acker (who is attached to direct a feature adaptation of Thomas The Tank Engine!) adapted his incredible short film that took him 5 years to create during college to a feature length here; the animation is really cool and a great example of digital animation being used to enhance a story. The voice cast are spectacular and every character is made special thanks to the vocal work colliding with the design; Elijah Wood as 9, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, John C. Reilly and Crispin Glover are all distinctively beautiful to listen to. It's a joy to watch Landau record his dialogue in the behind the scenes also; such a passion for the character! Tim Burton himself felt very close to the project after having seen the original short and wanted to support the production all the way, seeing real creativity in its vision and took a producers role. The timeframe remains obscure throughout which I really liked although it seems to be an alternate universe after World War II with its references to wartime news footage. One of the most memorable sequences is played out with Judy Garland's 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' playing in the background. The juxtaposition of the imagery and the switch from hope to doom in that scene is really effective! Overall, the message of humanity destroying itself feels a bit heavy-handed sometimes but it's an enjoyable animation with fantastic inspiration, warm moments and pretty cool monsters!",9
77,saraccan,Undecided about where to take it,7,7 October 2019,"When I start watching an animation movie, I usually expect it to be a either kids' or adults' movie. When the movie is not clear about who the audience is, it usually can't reach out or connect with anyone. I think this is the case in 9. It is a dark and kinda gloomy movie. But it also lacks any kind of real maturity. So in the end it just comes out as a simple movie with nice animation and a straightforward story.9 is a ragdoll who wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world and trying to make sense of his purpose.",9

Despite some common ground with other science fiction this is still a very original story. The film is labeled steam punk by some which is a science fiction / fantasy sub-genre.The film has very good cgi animation, good character development and an effective story. It's a testament to the film makers how much the audience actually manages to connect with these characters despite their appearance and also how much we care about the resolution of their story.The films strong voice cast is an eclectic group including; Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau, John C Reilly, Elijah Wood, Jennifer Connelly and Crispin Glover.The film is a re-imagining of the Oscar nominated short film of the same name by Shane Acker who directed this film and was responsible for the original story. The original short film made enough of an impression on Tim Burton that he decided to produce this full length feature version. For those that are interested the short film can be found on YouTube. Although the look is very much the same the obvious difference other length is that the short film was told without dialogue.

79,Meven_Stoffat,Why is 6 afraid of 7? Because 7 8 9.,1,13 September 2009,"I seriously can't believe Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, two people I LOVE, signed on to produce this crap. Tim Burton is a brilliant director, but to be honest I've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations. He did produce the brilliant ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", which is one I've watched multiple times, and directed movies like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE: Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director.Those two people producing one of the many reasons I was excited to see 9. So today I went to go see it at the theatre. I was so excited to finally have seen it. I had waited 7 months for the movie to come out.This movie is the first time I've walked out of a Tim Burton-related movie and said ""I enjoyed almost NONE of that"". I felt heartbroken to even have felt that way. I mean, with him and Bekmambetov at the production helm you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch. Right now I still can't get over how let down I was by this movie. I hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now, I can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie. Hell, Neil Blomkamp made an AWESOME full length remake of Alive in Joburg entitled District 9, what was so hard to get right about 9??? I really wanted to think this movie was awesome. I really did. But no, it failed on so many levels.The plot was extremely confusing and disjointed. I had no idea what was going on, let alone what it was about. Basically it's about a bunch of rag doll robots trying to save the earth. Well, OK, that's what I got from it. But the writing here is extremely poor. The whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with A.D.D. telling a story. There's this big, giant clanky monster robot that 9 awakens, causing destruction and stuff. That's the main villain. However, what else is wrong with this movie is that EVERYTHING COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. There were too many monster robots, most of which have no logical explanation behind them. They have 0 development whatsoever. I mean, that flying pterodactyl like monster just rips out of nowhere, we have no idea where it comes out of and Acker just expects us to know what it is. What was even more retarded was that snake-like creature with the strobing eyes that hypnotize. I dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh. All of the 3 people I told about it burst out laughing. Oh and it wraps victims up and sews them inside it. I'M. NOT. KIDDING.The twist in Act III is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie. So basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in, finds this box with a hologram from the scientist in it for 9, and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth, but then evil humans use it for war, and it was supposed to help protect the earth, but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it. And HE ONLY MENTIONS GIVING HIS LIFE TO 9. But what about the other robots? WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO THEM???????? This is the perfect example of poor, rushed writing. There's only one of the life taking device thingy that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them??????? The characters are not likable at all either. They risk their lives for no reason at all. The only good character is 7. 6 annoyed me with his ""GO BACK TO THE SOURCE!!!!!!"" ramblings, 1 is an overpowering idiot, 2 we don't know ANYTHING about, 5 kept annoying me with his ""Are you sure..."" or ""Can I stay here instead...?"" questions. And that ending? UGH. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge WTF moment.There's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation. Everything looks realistic and beautiful, I love the gloomy and depressing look of everything. However, beauty can't save a good movie.While it's true that this movie is very pretty looking, pretty is as pretty does, and 9 does squat. I'm sure Burton fans will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt, in fact with his and Bekmambetov's names being thrown around the promos, people will be flocking to the theatre to see this movie. I know I may be making a big deal out of nothing, but watching this movie made me realize how much I hate movies with unlikeable characters, nonexistent plot and just pure style over content.

All that remains is a collection of rag dolls,each with elements of the soul of a scientist,who's inventions eventually destroyed the human race,via neo fascism (sound pretty bleak already?). One of the rag dolls is trying to find out just what happened to it's creator,and if there is any others of it's kind left.

The voice ensemble is headed up by the likes of Christopher Plummer,Martin Landau,Elijah Wood,Crispin Glover,Jennifer Conneley & John C.Reilly. Despite the fact that this is an animated film,this is NOT a film for very young children,which contains some pretty nightmarish & intense moments that could scare the young 'uns under the age of seven (hence,the PG-13 rating). Personally,I found the film to be a wee bit too short,and does manage to leave a few ends undone...but is still worth seeking out by those who regard animation as an art form.",9

83,Quebec_Dragon,Good but somewhat disappointing,6,15 September 2009,"A little puppet rag doll machine with a 9 painted on his back comes to life in a deserted room, he opens a window to find that everything outside has been destroyed as if in a war. The best part for me was the visual design of those small rag doll machines, a mix between the evil Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas and the protagonist Sackboy from the game Little Big Planet. I found their mechanical ""eyes"" fascinating but also distracting. The doll creatures showed emotion and some character but nowhere near the same league as Wall-E's robots who had much less to work with. To be fair, the limited (some would say lacking) characterizations of the rag doll robot creatures can theoretically be explained by their origins but that could have been better told and exploited. The animation for them was top-notch though. I liked the production design of the post-apocalyptic world but nothing blew me away.9 is produced by Tim Burton but it doesn't have the same sense of wonder and cleverness present in most of his films so be forewarned. The action scenes were exciting and well shot but the storyline didn't feel satisfying especially the ending. The reason for the creation of the little rag doll creatures didn't make much logical sense to me. There's not much social commentary, originality (beyond visual) or humor in here that would have pushed 9 in the realm of classic. So overall, although I enjoyed the look of the film, I was left wanting in terms of story and emotional involvement. Adults would probably like it more if it was more mature, complex and darker while children would probably like it more if the characters were more personable. I wouldn't pay full price for 9 in the theatre.Rating: 6.5 out of 10",9
84,mirosuionitsaki2,Excellent,9,4 November 2009,"While there were some eye-gouging moments in this movie, they were all part of the plan. This movie has created a subculture of it's own with t-shirts and websites like Nightmare Before Christmas did. If you enjoyed that movie, you surely will enjoy this. Now I will be brief, seeing how I haven't seen this movie since a few weeks ago.There were some confusing plot holes, such as with the plot. It was difficult to understand what time frame the movie was set in, but ignoring that, we'd find this movie to be pretty enjoyable. I enjoyed the character's teamwork and the clever barriers aka monsters along the way. I disliked the ending very much. Many characters died and they were never returned back to life, making you wonder what is to happen next? Is there room for a sequel?",9
85,FairlyAnonymous,"A refreshing animated movie, though not great",7,22 May 2013,"I remember that when I first heard of the movie I knew that I had to go see it. The had already seen the original animated short and I was extremely excited to see a feature film that would expand on the concept of the short. Everything in the trailers made the movie look like it was going to blow away the competition (as far as animated movies go) with a dark compelling tell in a post-apocalyptic world. While I will say I was initially disappointed that was probably because I had such high expectations and had seen about 10 minutes of the movie before it was released. Either way it is a good movie, just not great.The movie revolves around a rag-doll named 9 who wakes up in a world where humans are all dead and creepy machines roam the streets, hunting 9 down. Along the way he stumbles across other rag-dolls which are numbers 1-8. While this leads to an interesting premise of an action oriented movie with unique characters it does suffer from some fairly big issues: the dialogue... or the lack there of. The movie has very little dialogue that isn't generic, and the dialogue is mainly used as a way of explaining what is going and not really used for character development. The characters are all fairly one dimensional which is a real shame considering the great potential this movie could've had with character development. While the movie lacks character development it does succeed in other areas.The atmosphere in this movie is brilliant. Everything is eerie, creepy, has shades of green and brown, and the robotic monsters look fantastic. It is obvious that a lot of time went into designing the world to look like the cover of a heavy-metal album. I really liked how some of the monsters moved in an almost stop-motion fashion to add to their creepiness and their swiftness. Each monster has its own unique abilities and works like a video-game boss battle. Which also leads to some pretty cool action sequences. While the actions scenes are fairly short, they are still really cool to watch and really well done.Overall 9 suffers from a fairly straight-forward plot which ends exactly where you would expect it to. There aren't any real twists, any interesting character development, or anything in the plot that makes it really engaging. However, the action and the atmosphere are the real reasons why you want to watch the movie. It brings up some concepts which haven't been used in fully computer animated films so I can give it credit for being a bit different.My first thought of this movie would be a 6.5 or a 7. It isn't for everyone, but it is cool to watch.",9
86,MarcoParzivalRocha,Beautiful animation and story,7,7 September 2020,"A rag doll that wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world holds the key to the planet's salvation. The story is simple, with little characters development, but the relationships between them are easily recognizable and we feal a real connection, so to speak, which for an animation of just over 1 hour and 20 minutes is a good achievement. It stands out visually for the depth and detail in it, at a time of transition and new methods for animation technology (2009/2010). It is a film with a great didactic content and with an ethical and moral conscience, and above all of what it is to be human, and what this entails for the destiny of our planet, and deserves more recognition for that. The cast is great, with names like Elijah Wood and Christopher Plummer.",9
87,Rabh17,"A beautiful, stark tale",10,16 January 2010,"A lot of people seem to damn this movie with faint praise: too weak on Plot, too lacking in Details, short of Back-story, PIXAR could have done it better. . .Please. . . It tells a story of the NOW. Strange little creations, the last act of a doomed scientist, awake and hiding in a terrible world where all human life is lost. What happened before, you are given glimpses, and you should be able to put them together-- not that it's all that difficult: the Perils of All-Out War are simple, not complex.The morals and the aim of the story are simple. The emotions and the characters are simple, but that is NOT a failing. The Best Stories are sometimes the one with the strong, simple parts that leave a lasting touch.This is an example of Animation that is NOT for Kids-- but that does NOT mean that it must be Explicit, X-rated, Disturbing, or Bloodily graphic. Yet ""9"" is definitely for Adults.Sometimes, sometimes, even us Grown-ups need a Fairy-Tale. And this is a Fairy-Tale, not in the Disney-PIXAR-saccharine variety-- but the Old Grimm vein. The Point: ""To tell a Tale such that it will not be forgotten. . .""Watch 9 with serious intent. And hold a loved one close while you do.",9
88,RichardSRussell-1,I Was Hoping for Better,6,9 September 2009,"9 (R, 1:19) — SF, 2nd string, originalBoy, I so wanted to like this picture, but it's sort of the inverse of last week's Gamer (4), which I described as having good story ideas badly executed. 9, OTOH, is wonderfully imaginative in its production design and execution but disappointingly single-threaded in plot.It opens with scenes of WW1-style warfare and destruction, accompanied by a sad voice-over: ""We had such potential... Our world is ending, but life must go on."". And then we see consciousness arriving for a spindle-shaped burlap guy with camera-shutter eyes and a giant hand-lettered ""9"" on its back; ""he"" (I guess) is filled with wonder at who he is, what's going on, and what this world is all about. He appears to have a giant zipper up the front, but as he makes his way across a desktop and a book to reach a shuttered window, we realize that the zipper is normal size, it's the guy who's little — about cat-sized.This is 9 (voiced by Elijah Wood), and shortly he meets fellow fabric manikins 1–8, all of whom are refugees from the last of the machines that had recently exterminated humanity. That this is an alternate reality is evident from the battle scenes, all clockwork, gaslight, rust-covered, early 20th Century tech, not a glimmer of electronics (let alone Skynet) anywhere in sight.The rest of the movie is devoted to 1–9 trying to escape from the last monster machine — a large, clanking, single-minded contraption with a big glowing red ""eye"" and multiple bladed arms — a construct capable of (apparently) sucking the souls out of any of these little gunnysack digits it can grab.And that's about it for plot.I appreciated that the boldest character among the dolloids, the intrepid 7, had a female voice (Jennifer Connelly). Unfortunately, ""she"" appeared to be the only ""woman"" in the movie. There were no overt evidences of gender on any of the burlap critters, so if the future of life on Earth is dependent on these little dudes reproducing, it looks like a pretty long shot. Most post-apocalyptic stories at least try to offer a ray of hope at the end, but this one looked frankly bleak. I give it an extra point for that, simply because it's a relatively daring thing for a movie to do.The animation was evidently done (or at least supervised) by Starz Animation, and it has a consistent look and feel to it, as original as The Nightmare before Christmas (7), and this too earns some credit in my book. Animation can give you all the time and space in the world, but this final drama on Earth is cramped, taking place in about a day in a ruined cityscape within about 2 klicks of the house where 9 first wakes up.So, even tho it fell short of my hopes, there are sufficient positive aspects that it edges up to the top of my ""up to you"" range and gets a 6. I guess that's 9 upside down, huh?",9
89,honorhorror,"Disturbing, impressive beginning, development, climax, only to be let down by the conclusion.",7,20 November 2009,"Given the apocalyptic scenario, 9 is quite a different touch from the animation genre, so when it comes to the way they describe the earth with no human, only puny, fragile robots reflecting human's shape existed the whole movie worked quite competitively.Building the suspension piece by piece, the story lead the audiences into a world where every single matchstick is quite a treasure. While all the 9 robots have their distinctive personalities, the audiences start to rebuild the picture of the mystery. The story is definitely influenced by the quite influential modern ""ennegram theory"" about 9 basic personalities humans tend to possess. This made the movie looked more sophisticated and had a lot of potential.However the potential had to be wasted given the limited budget and running time of the movie. At last, you are gonna scratch on your head, what the heck they want to say by this ending. Fortunately that's the only big mistake of the movie which kept reminding you it's just not that extraordinary.7/10 Watch out for the visual impacts along with the harsh, disturbing tone. Definitely not for children, but can be a good ride for societal science students.",9
90,pontram,"initially fascinating, later mundane",6,6 January 2010,"The creators of this movie would have deserved much better scripting and plotting, as they spent obviously much effort and love (and money) into bringing it to life.At first I thought it is a realization of a computer game like Myst, with the only difference that there is no interaction. The are with no doubt simply great, and once more it is shown here what an expensive real orchestra can do for a movie, if there's a proper score (Mr. Elfman is involved).Unfortunately the movie broke down for me when it turned to a too simple hide-and-seek fight orgy, and evolved very questionable story/plot-holes. In my opinion, if you begin a movie with artistic and intellectual claims, you should not let it go TMT (Teenage Mutant Turtles). This may sound a little harsh, but that's what I felt during watching. The first half hour is simply too promising, as it floats well with very few dialog and places mystery after mystery, which are alas later not solved very satisfying, or, at least, thoughtfully.Also, the characters were a bit uninteresting, except No.1, who is spoken by the great Mr. Plummer. As No.1 is not the main character, this is not an advantage.The movie wants too much - remain us about the human tendency to self-destruction, frighten us with aliens, show us how bravery can save the world, go alternative ways, etcetera etcetera, combined with the lack of talented script-writers. It stumbles at its own ambitious hurdles. I don't know how much Bekmambetov was involved, but his Influence is hardly noticeable. Maybe he or Burten liked the soul-dividing thing, but it's not that impressing executed, so we don't ah and oh with it.It is not made for children, a rare occasion where the PG13+ rating is correct in respect of environmental and enemy creepiness. Older ones will not be satisfied with the short playtime, lack of humor and the lame conclusion.The high-class orchestral accompaniment is present most of the running time and saves the movie, together with the 3d-artists, from downfall. I highly recommend buying the soundtrack, if available.However, good intentions are not always leading to the best results...",9
91,iguth,999999,8,8 May 2019,"His movie is called 9 and it was released on 9/9/2009. This is one of the most creative animated films of the 21st century. A plot of man vs. machine without any man is super interesting and well done. The differing personalities of the characters provide a fun contrast and hierarchy and the idea that they are all aspects of one man is great. I love the numbering system, it is great to have characters that don't even have names. The villain is very big bad but the combat is creative thanks to the post-apocalyptic environment it is set in. Our main character is clearly the main character but it works fine. The voice acting is fine and the whole art style is stunning, especially compared to other animated films. The plot evolves to an eventual fight against the big baddy but all throughout, the general mystery of the past and what happened here looms over you.",9
92,deacon_blues-3,Better living through Alchemy?????!!!!,6,21 September 2009,"I first of all, must say that 9 has the most spectacular animation of any film I have ever seen, and I consider myself a connoisseur of such things. Unfortunately, once you get past the technical brilliance there is little of memorable value. Character development is truncated and sacrificed on the altar of fast-paced action sequences. When will directors realize that audiences need to care about characters before a story becomes involving? We have the stereotypical old stick-in-the-mud, the kindly but impotent victim, the sphinx-like twins, the helpless but well-intentioned bumbler, the manic artiste, the daring warrior, the muscle-bound henchman, and the prophesied messiah whom no one understands or wants to follow until the last minute. All of them seem like cardboard standees. And I'm not sure what the message of the film is supposed to be: Friendship? We need to put our soul in our technology? Better living through alchemy? Scientists need to turn to antiquated mysticism before they invent anymore machines? Our souls have 9 parts? How does one put one's soul into a technology, anyway? Is Steve Jobs our example? If it's Bill Gates, then I'd rather the world end and get it over with now......",9
93,robotbling,"Gorgeous, but story could be better",7,12 December 2011,"9 is a strange film. Originally a short film created by Shane Acker for his thesis in computer animation, Tim Burton caught wind of it and decided to produce a full-length feature based on the short. I genuinely enjoyed it for its moody visuals and themes, which earned it its PG-13 rating, but at the same time felt it failed to live up to its full potential. At its heart, 9 is a mix of sci-fi ideas we've seen many times before: it's part Terminator, part Matrix, and even part Lord of the Rings – which leads to many clichés.The movie takes place in an alternate reality in which a fascist country echoing Nazi Germany seizes control of a brilliant scientist's A.I. creation simply called ""The Machine"", which promptly turns against the humans. What little we see of humanity takes place in newsreel flashbacks and their lifeless remains. As the war machines take over the world, the scientist manages to create a series of small robots in his lab to continue the spirit of mankind. The film opens as his 9th and final creation boots up completely unaware of who or what it is, or what has happened to the world.I'll have to venture into spoiler territory to lay out the issues I had with it, so if you haven't seen the film I'd advise you to watch it first.One of 9′s best ideas is that the scientist gifted each of his robot creations a piece of his own soul. This explains the archetypal nature of the heroes and where their sentience comes from. Unfortunately, 9 accidentally reawakens The Machine, which feeds on this energy, and is intelligent enough to fabricate robot minions that are more compelling than itself, which is basically just a big monster with a glowing red eye.The film falters when, rather than seeing the heroes combine their creative spirit and intelligence to fight The Machine by inventing mechanical tools, we are left with a series of hand-to-hand fight scenes involving mainly makeshift melee weapons. These are action-packed and fun to watch, but don't make good use of the film's underlying premise. Near the beginning of the film, 9 creates a torch from an old light bulb and battery. I would have liked to see the heroes put their heads together to come up with more interesting solutions like this in the spur of the moment to reflect their creator's inventive spirit, particularly as they band together to finally end the menace of The Machine.The best ideas seem to get lost amidst the action scenes. 9 soon runs afoul of the de facto leader of the group, who has taken a neo-Luddite stance in regards to science and wears makeshift religious attire. He and some of the others have taken refuge in what appears to be the shell of Notre Dame cathedral and forbids 9 from venturing too far afield. This undertone of science vs religion, introduced so early in the film, is quickly abandoned when it could have played a much more pivotal role.The film also ends on a false spiritual note when, having reclaimed the souls of the lost members of the group, they are released to the heavens instead of (as I think most people will be expecting) they could have been returned to their bodies and been brought back to life. While that would have been perhaps a bit too easy and happy for this film, I think it makes more sense than what finally happens.While this review might seem largely negative, let me reaffirm that it is an enjoyable and visually stunning action movie. Shane Acker proves he can direct frenetic action scenes that will have you riveted to your seat. His willingness to venture into dark and often frightening territory is a welcome change of pace compared to the vast majority of Western animated films and Tim Burton was right to open the door for his directorial debut. It's just too bad that 9 isn't the 9 out of 10 it could have been. And I do look forward to seeing what this new young director comes up with next.",9
94,chandean-69762,9 2009 Review,10,22 February 2021,"This is probably one of my earliest theatre experiences I can remember.
I remember going on opening day with my dad because i just loved the idea of the movie ""9"" coming out on 09/09/2009, and being 9 years old. It all felt whimsical to me.9 has to be one of my all time favorite animated films. It's extremely dark with a post apocalyptic setting and some terrifying monster / creature designs. (The snake one scared the hell out of me when I was little.) And speaking of the character design, it's genius. All of it feels super unique and plays off of the size and personalities of each character. The world feels huge and expansive, and each setting has its own rustic, worn down atmosphere to it that feels full of life while also having no life around.
Action is also great, it's thrilling and with each new monster / creature the characters have to adjust to their circumstances making each fight unique and full of risk.
Even with how short this movie is, it's perfectly paced, nothing feels unneeded or out of place, everyone gets their moments, the story grips you and throws you into this amazing world, the tone never lets up, and the ending always makes me emotional.
All of this combined, what's not to love about this?",9
95,thebogofeternalstench,Extremely disappointing,3,19 October 2010,"I thought 9 would be really cool, but its just an empty shell.9's story really doesn't make much sense.....humans failed against the 'machines', but these tiny little rag doll robots the humans made were able to defeat the machines???? I really can't be bothered to explain the story, as really there isn't much of one, but what I can say is 9 has nothing new to offer.The dialogue is poor, uninspiring, dull and clichéd, you barely get anything out of Jennifer Connelly, the whole cast in fact is totally forgettable, just like the movie.I did enjoy the animation somewhat, the scenery was pretty cool. But the rag doll things were such badly made up creations that they were irritating to look at.The one and only scene i found funny/enjoyable was when that big bully rag doll is getting high/pleasure from putting a magnet above his head.There were a lot of boring tedious fight scenes and....uggghh...9 is so forgettable and such a mediocre effort.I had planned to see 9 at the cinema but never got round to it...I'm SO glad I didn't pay cinema prices to see it.Give it a miss.",9
96,jburtroald95,"Worth a look, but don't expect much",6,26 December 2009,"Shane Acker's wild animated sci-fi/ fantasy flick is rather disappointing and forgettable, though it undoubtedly deserves this year's credit for having the shortest title and for being the hardest film to get into as the script is all an incoherent mess of ideas.To add to the confusion, it seems without a target audience with its uneven clutter of techniques.On the one hand, it's jam-packed with fast-paced yet tiresomely repetitive action that still would no doubt appeal to small children. The actual story itself is also quite shallow and juvenile, nothing too heavy or complex and again will surely be interesting to the younger ones.On the other hand, it is classified M, briefly touches on some more mature themes, and contains some very disturbing and startling imagery.Too frightening for kids, but too childlike and simple for adults, 9 sadly seems quite ill-fated.But on a more positive note, its visuals are delightful – with evident influences from skilled producer Tim Burton – and it is fine work from the animators, who deliver some exciting scenery and a substantial handful of dynamic characters.The mostly well-selected cast supplying the voices to these characters features Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, Jennifer Connelly, Fred Tatasciore, Alan Oppenheimer and Elijah Wood.The film's premise is also impressive, being a planet wrecked and ravaged by human technology gone corrupt and evil, and littered with the haunting remains of Earth's former inhabitants and the world they lived in.Though – unlike its opening suggests – it is not a controversial, well-deserved jab at industrialisation. These rich concepts provide only the background explanation for the story, which instead focuses more on the idea honest, innocent people making terrible mistakes with dire consequences, and their quest for redemption and resolution.Getting back to the story, Pixar has always known that ""The story is king."" and that when making an animated movie, filmmakers should always perfect the story before proceeding to the other stages, and now we can see why. The grossly underdeveloped narrative lets down and wastes all the aforementioned positive aspects, and the entire film very nearly falls apart.Being unbearably thin and with very small potential, it is very much like the story of a superfluous sequel. Burton should have been put in charge of crafting the narrative, he never disappoints, and Acker and Pamela Pettler have done the scope and design of the story very crudely and hurriedly.Also, countless times while watching this, you will be uninterested and very impatient for the story to move along. For there are such agonizingly long intervals between the few and rather indistinguishable major events.Still, it is worth watching if you have the time.",9
97,ciscokid1970,Outstanding visual with a great story,10,22 February 2010,"This is one of those movies that left me in amazement after I watched it. It is a sci-fi story with a man's destruction theme presented in a way that is family friendly.The story is like a combination of Terminator and Edward Scisor hands. The story has a fresh perspective in the way that a doll is a hero and have outlived humans. I love the level of detail the film was made to. Even though the majority of the movie is shot in shades of grays and browns, they used every available color in those ranges and magnificent use of light. It does tap into the sad belief that man is very capable of destroying himself, but not so strongly that it can still be watched by children.Another thing that makes this so impressive is that this movie is Shane Acker's first big screen movie...outstanding. It is a film length version of his college project movie. (which also included on the DVD). I have the DVD version and it is rich in detail, I can only imagine the Blue Ray must immerse you in the picture.This movie should WIN an Oscar for cinematography or animation.They make use of some of my favorite actors voices including Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Connelly, John C Riley, and Martin Landau.

98,scarletminded,Scary eye-candy steampunk vibe with no real happy ending...,7,23 September 2010,"I watched this and Wall-E the same day. The two have characters that aren't human against a desolate landscape, but Wall-E is charming, when 9 is really dismal. I am not sure if this movie could be watched by kids, because the action is scary. Like 9 comes to life and immediately has to deal with violent machine animals and stuff that would occur in a horror film and probably get a R rating, if it was humans instead of animation. Where as Wall-E seemed to have a soul, the old man creator (reminded me a lot of Edward Scissorhands) died, using the last bit of his soul to create creatures with no idea what to do about things and even at the end, you are still left with a feeling of dread. These creatures are going to make a ""new world?"" How? I feel they might decay or die in their own way without any reproduction and the world will never begin anew. All the human are dead as far as I know. Sort of scary and sad. And since the scientist created an evil robot with his own soul, I wonder what this movie says about the human soul...that even a good soul can be corrupted and then that machine that was created for peace will war and kill everything in sight. Quite more disturbing than the Wall-E way of us just over consuming and being buried in our own garage. The movie has a WWII vibe and maybe that is why it is so dark. It's a steampunk version of a bleak future. The characters are half damned to try to save it and many of them give up their piece of their soul for the process, I wouldn't say die really since they aren't alive, but I thought seriously that the little guys were supposed to give their souls up and then once done, the world would come back to life, but that never happened.I liked the animation because it reminded me a lot of Tim Burton and other steampunk movies I have seen. It was really dismal and depressing though. I wouldn't recommend it to kids unless they are teenagers. Younger kids might find this movie disturbing. I did and I am an adult whose watched a lot of horror films and see that reflected here in the same way, only with dolls instead of humans.",9

I loved the post-apocalyptic setting and the design of the characters. I appreciated the choice of the bad guys too.Unfortunately the movie ends when it is not appropriate to end. Clearly this movie needed a longer runtime. I mean it is only 1 hr and 11min of ACTUAL animation. And it cost $30M? This movie needed to be at least 90 full minutes of actual animation to actually tell the full story and give us a proper ending. This is probably why the movie got low ratings because it abruptly ends.Conclusion: there is a lot to like and appreciate about this film and definitely deserves a shot and I recommend to watch it. Unfortunately it is only 1hr and 11 min long and it does not even have an ending. So much potential, I wish we had gotten an ending and I would have happily watched any sequels.

101,mitchell5954,One of Burton's Best!,10,12 September 2014,"Nine is an animated film produced by Tim Burton in 2009. Even though Burton only helped produce this movie it has his fingerprints all over it. The style of this film is very Burton but in a good way. In my opinion this is one of his best pictures regardless of his limited involvement. It has an intriguing premise (though a bit tired), has great character, and has great animation and a stellar atmosphere.The film follows a living rag doll named 9 (Elijah Wood) that wakes-up to a world ravaged by a war between humans and machines. He encounters several other living rag dolls named 1, 2 5, 6, 8, and 7 (Jennifer Connelly). They're the last living beings on Earth besides the machines. Now these rag dolls find themselves in a battle with the remaining machines.The premise of a post-apocalyptic world where machines have destroyed mankind due to a war is nothing new, but they manage to tell this story in a unique way. I haven't seen a story revolving around a group of living rag dolls before that wasn't a comedy. There are no humans present at all aside from flashbacks and exposition videos. Despite this the characters are so enjoyable that it doesn't matter that there are no humans. Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay should take note of this when doing Transformers. You don't always need a human element to be invested in a story like this. I liked or, at least, identified with all the characters. Even with 1, the prick, of the group, I could see where he was coming from. There is a twist at the end that is a bit iffy but I didn't mind it that much. This is just a world where things like that can happen.As I said earlier the animation is spectacular. The 3D animation is some of the best I've seen and feels necessary. I usually like 2D animation more but in this case I can't see this movie working in 2D as well. The voice acting is great as well. Elijah Wood does an amazing job as 9. Until I looked this up online I did not know he did the voice of 9. He really disappeared in the role which is good and doesn't feel distracting.Overall, I think 9 is one of the best films Burton has been involved with. I don't care what people say, I like this film just as much (if not more) as Nightmare Before Christmas. It's an amazing animated film for all ages. It's not like most 3D animated films out there. It has a dark atmosphere and some scenes can be intense, but I think this movie is definitely suitable for kids and adults can enjoy it as well.",9
102,samuelding85,9 - Not Your Usual Kiddy Animation,6,9 September 2009,"The poster of 9 looks like any other normal children animation. In this case, looks are deceiving. 9 do not behave like your usual Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks animation.Based on the 2005 Academy Award nominated short film of the same title, 9 is the first full length feature from the director Shane Acker, which the 79 minute long animation gets strong support from two directors who makes an out of this world movie: Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov. So expect an animation that is more teenage and adult oriented, rather than animations featuring talking animals.The story begins in a post-apocalyptic world, where human beings extincts due to the elimination of killing machines that was meant to fight in a war, but goes horribly wrong instead. Enters #9 (voice of Elijah Wood), a rag doll with human characteristic, rescued by a fellow rag doll #5 (John C.Reilly) from the hands of an existing killing machine. His adventure to rescue the remaining rag dolls continues when he met #1 (Christopher Plummer) and #7 (Jennifer Connelly), while at the same time, fighting against the machine that is out there to eliminate all the remaining rag dolls.9 is an animation which consists of the following: Acker's idea of using rag dolls to represent human beings, throwing in the fantasy presentation from the mind of Tim Burton and the action that is similar to Timur Bekmambetov's previous production. (Nightwatch, Daywatch and Wanted) Here, survival is the most important issues the rag dolls needs to handle, thus 9 greatly focuses on the survival of rag dolls, and fighting against the machines. Cheesy sidekick of romance has beenreplaced with cruel truth on not fighting so as to avoid reality. Notto mention that the rag dolls are fighting against the machines withany weapons they could lay their hands on(scissors, knifes, leftover ammunitions and fuels), so expect a certain level of violence that is easy on the teens and adults.No usual story plot on how an animal or superhero possessing supernatural power saving the day, just some common people like you and me playing a game of survival, using anything that could lay our hands on. 9 dealt with issues an ordinary animation has never touch on, at a pace where everyone feels easy. Though the plot is more adult-oriented, it is not as heavily as adult animations discussing more serious issues (Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly and Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir falls under the latter.) Worth giving a try if you are tired of the popcorn animation out there.",9
103,das417,A less than impressive story despite some good CGI,7,12 September 2009,"9 is the story of a world destroyed by war. A less than original idea, but the twist is that this time the heroes in this dark world are not human survivors but a series of puppet like creations. It is these creations who hold the key to the survival of the world. 9 will be known for its CGI effects but the story itself should have been the focus of the movie. 9 (Elijah Wood) awakes in a world where death is everywhere. Unsure of where he is, or what he is, he wanders out into a land filled with ruins and the remains of humanity. He is discovered by 2 (Martin Landau) who is just like him except that he has a different number and personality. 9 is grateful to make a friend but 2 is soon taken away by a strange beast that is half skeleton and have machine. It is then that 9 realizes that the world he is in is a place of terror.Discovering a group of other survivors who are also like him, 9 learns that the leader of this group, 1 (Christopher Plummer), refuses to fight or do anything else besides hide. 9 refuses to do nothing and instead, with the help of 5 (John C. Reilly), tries to rescue 2. With the help of 7 (Jennifer Connelly) 9 and 5 discover the location of 2 and the nature of the beast that holds him. However, in doing so, they awaken the very machine responsible for the end of humanity. 9 and the rest of the survivors then must defeat the very monster that their own creator was responsible for unleashing upon the world.9 will be remembered for its CGI but little more. The plot is lacking of a real explanation for what has happened and that effects the rest of the movie. There is no real reason given for why 9 and the others had to be created in order to defeat the machine itself. More explanation would have helped the final scene where apparently life is created once more through the spirit of the machines and its inventor. 9 felt at times lacking in detail while spending too much time focused on the effects. The darkness of the world was impressive, but it felt as if director Shane Acker and Pamela Pettler built the story around the world instead of the other way around. The CGI is worth watching but don't expect more. 9 will stand out but not long enough to be worth remembering.7/10",9
104,JimD73,Nightmare fuel unleaded,8,14 January 2010,"Animation does not mean a kids movie. I'm not referring to movies like Wall-E where they can enjoyed by all ages in this group. I'm not referring to South Park where its crude and done for laughs. I'm referring to stuff like Secret of Nimh, where it looks like it might be for kids but in reality will only succeed in giving them horrible nightmares for years to come (those damn rats). 9 can be said to be the Nimh for this generation, giving nightmares of machines and monsters for years to come. And, like Nimh, its a damn good movie, although perhaps not in the right media.9 opens in some kind of laboratory, where a scientist creates his ninth sack-man robot...thing. It cuts forward, and the scientist is dead on the floor and 9 awakens. As 9 explores the deserts apocalypse that Earth now is, he encounters the other 8 creations as well as the robotic beasts that hunt them.9 has its greatest strength in its visual style. As 9 wanders around the new world, dead bodies scattered here and there, the sombre visuals recall the wastelands of Wall-E. The machines are scary as all hell at times, and always creative. Some visuals, such as the, erm, ""soul-sucking"" become repetitive and lose their effect, but regardless, the visuals of the film will stick with you.The characters are also quite well portrayed. Sure, they can fit into some stereotypes and none are terribly depthy, but a revalation two-thirds of the way through explains this perfectly well. There's 1, the fearful leader, 2, the engineer, 3 & 4, twin cataloguers, 5, 2's loyal apprentice, 6, the artist, 7, the brave heroine, 8, the brawler, and 9, the hero. Some don't get quite the attention they maybe deserved, notably 6, but they each get their moments to shine.More time to invest in these characters might have been preferably, leading me to my main complaint. 9 is by all means a good movie, but it feels like it would have been better as a comic book series or a video game. As a series, the characters would be more fleshed out in print than on film, and maybe would have made it a better ensemble rather than 9's story.As for the video game argument, the story structure of 9 feels all too much like a game. The progression is episodic, with ""quests"" for something usually ending in the theatrical equivalent of a boss fight. If it is adapted to a game, it has a lot of potential, but as a movie, it has an odd feel in that sense.Despite the problems with the narrative, 9 is a visual wonder, and by that alone is recommended. Maybe its destined to become a cult classic, with fanfics and spinoffs galore to fully flesh out the universe. Just don't scare the kids with it.",9

106,lopcar1993,One of the best films of the year!! And done of the best animated films of all time,10,31 October 2009,"I first heard about ""9"" like most people did, sitting a dark movie theater waiting for my movie to play. And as I was waiting a quaint and dark little trailer started to roll it showed a bombed out city and as I watched I became more and more intrigued at the premise of the film and the dark, Gothic style it infused with the brilliant and breathtaking animation. But I didn't see it it until about a month later and now I'm regretting not having seen it while it was in theaters, Shane Acker and Tim Burton's ""9"" is brilliant, heartbreaking, dark, intense, breathtaking and at sometimes scary.""9"" is not a movie I would show my three step-sisters, the reason is is that ""9"" is at sometimes very scary and is a little too dark and violent for the mainstream children audience of 5-9 but.The age group of 10-50 may enjoy this film much more than the younger seeing as it is aimed at the more adult and teenage audience. But with that said ""9"" is a sweeping animated epic that sucks you into a dystopia world and takes you on an adventure the likes you've never seen before, this film get's it's themes straight from the visionary minds of producer Tim Burton and Director Shane Acker they create a vision of a destroyed world and tell you a story of the nine little voodoo dolls that have to save civilization, It's quite a fascinating story and will surely entertain you while it blows your mind as well. Some people think this film doesn't deserve much acclaim or praise, but I'm sorry to say this film deserves every bit of the praise It something new and fresh and not kiddish at all but it does teach some great morals in it like friendship, overcoming your fear and rising to the occasion to be more than what you really are. All in all ""9"" is a fun, fantastic, action packed, dark and mythic Sci-Fi animated epic like no other.Elijah wood, Jennifer Connelly, Martin Landau, John C. Reilly, Christoper Plummer and Fred Tatasciore are all fantastic in this as the nine voodoo dolls tasked with stopping the deadly machines. They all bring something different to there characters. Elijah wood(9) brings a soft spoken and heroic prowess to his young character, and he makes 9 more of a hero than a coward he turns him into a leader that is small but has a big heart(metaphorically speaking.). Fred Tatsciore(you may know him as the man who voices Bruce Banner in The Ultimate Avengers.) Brings a strong but dim bulled wit to his character 8, his style and power is more driven toward brute force than brains seeing as 8 is the giant out of the nine, but none the less he brings a little likability to a rather not so likable character. Jennifer Connelly(7) Is tough, smart and strong, she is the second in command to 9, or that's how I see it. Connelly brings her toughness and power to an already impressive and imposing character. 7 is the strongest and the fighter out of the group, she is a force of nature and is not to be taken lightly. Crispin Glover(6) brings a quirky and Tim Burton type charm to this film as the lovable and misunderstood painter of the group, he's fantastic in the scenes he's in and he really brings the kindness and gentle quality to this film. John C. Reilly(5) plays the very friendly and caring 5, hr brings more than what is needed and that is alright because that humanizes the film and brings out of the extreme darkness set by the films story. while the twins 3 and 4 don't say anything they are very sweet and timid characters and are great to have on screen. Martin Landau(2) is the old quirk out of them. And while he may not have much screen time h e does do good at bringing a friendly and smart quality to his character. Christopher Plummer(1) Is the crass, cowardly and not so great leader of the nine. His character believes in hiding instead of learning the truth behind what has happened to the world around them and fighting back, but none the less Plummer does great with his character and brings great power to him. But all in all the cast does a fantastic job n this film and really elevates it to true greatness among the animated films.""9"" Is fantastic in every way imaginable and may not be very suitable for small children but anyone with a love of Tim Burton and his dark world will enjoy this film as much as I did. It's a fun filled Science Fiction epic that has ushered the way for more mature animated films and the breathtaking CGI effects and action sequences are more well worth the price of rental or admission. All in all ""9"" delivers.",9
107,EchoMaRinE,"starts nice, gets strange and ends even stranger",9,27 February 2010,"Let me begin with by saying I am a big sci-fi and animation fan so my opinion may be more positive than it could be on this movie. I read some comments and it seems the biggest problem is the plot (or the non-existence of one). The visuals are pretty good. As an animation, it is very well done but I must say the plot is at best strange. It starts nice, gets strange and ends even stranger. It is difficult to say what exactly the message of the movie (if there is any). Characters are fine but not extra-ordinary. A lot of things are unclear which makes you feel the plot is kind of random. Moral of the story, there is room for improvement but it is definitely not a bad movie.",9
108,dissident320,A neat idea that didn't merit a feature,5,20 August 2017,I'm starting to dread watching movies that are under 90 minutes. They almost always are stretching out a story that doesn't have enough to it to justify a feature. The voice work is all fine but the story just drags on with no real villain or pacing. The visuals sadly look extremely dated already with real-time rendering in video games already surpassing it.It probably should have just stayed as a short because 70 some minutes of this felt like 3 hours. Nothing much to recommend here other than some neat ideas that unfortunately get over-explained.,9
109,blackmambamark,What was Tim Burton thinking when he agreed to produce this?,5,10 September 2009,"Tim Burton, fantastic director right? Well directing isn't the only area Mr. Burton likes to dive into. He has produced some great animated gems in the past such as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and this years 3-D mind blower ""Coraline"". Needless to say, he has a creative vision, and anything that he has been apart of so far has been a visual feast. Well, since this movie was only 70 minutes long, it will be pretty easy to sum this one up. This is easily the worst animated movie of the year. Not only that, it is one of the worst animated movies i have ever seen. You have nine characters right, well the story and characters had zero depth. It was a story that was not only un-entertaining, but filled with tons of holes and problems that i cannot even go into because it would fill pages beyond belief. Nothing is explained, nor is it justified. It expects you to be blown away be the idea that machines have taken over the planet, and that is it, nothing else........wow, what a fantastic concept......i have never heard that idea before. But the biggest issue that bothered me more than anything, was the fact that full sized human beings could not defeat these machines......but 9 little rag dolls can put up a fight. To sum everything up, this movie made zero sense, and it presented it in the same fashion. Bottom Line.......already said it once and i will say it again, easily the worst animated movie of the year, as well as one of the worst movies of the year as well. I have no idea what all these big name actors were thinking when they agreed to voice this. One could say because it was Tim Burton bringing them all together.......well if that is true, then what in the hell was Tim Burton thinking? This story has hardly any dialogue, and no backbone to its story. How could anyone find any interest in this? I know the name Tim Burton may lure you into the theatre......but let me assure you, this movie is not worth it......its not even worth watching on cable. Please, stay far away. Im thankfull that it was only 70 minutes, because i think if it was longer, i might have walked out. Yeah, its that bad.",9
110,MetalAngel,"One of the best animated films of 2009, but just a tad disappointing...",7,5 January 2010,"This has been a very productive year concerning the creation of animated feature films, and surely one of the films which will be most remembered among them is Shane Acker's ""9"", a nice, entertaining fantasy thriller which never ceases to amaze the viewer throughout the hour and ten minutes it lasts.The premise is simple yet imaginative. The film opens with a scientist creating a rag doll, installing it binoculars for eyes and metal claws for hands; he paints the number '9' on its back. He stitches the limbs and the rags together with infinite care, and once he's finished, he dies. The rag doll awakes soon after in a post-apocalyptic world, where the human race has been destroyed by machines and where the planet harbors only remnants of destruction. This rag doll, 9, ventures out into the open and finds other rag dolls like him, each of them with a different number printed on their backs, and they're all running away and trying to survive a monstrous metal beast that stalks them and takes them away to an ominous-looking power plant. The film involves 9 and his newfound friends trying to make sense of the chaos that destroyed everyone, trying to destroy the beast and save the captive rag dolls imprisoned at the power plant, and trying to stop an impending proliferation of new machines bent on conquering the world...though, frankly, there's nothing left to conquer.I know, I know. It sounds like a deep, complicated story bearing endless plot twists, but it's not; it's as simple as can be. It's an extension of the 2006 Academy Award-nominated short film directed by Shane Acker (also titled ""9""). Now, ""9"", the short film, was an amazing (though fleeting) movie experience, where the post-apocalyptic images and profound anti-technology and anti-war messages mixed with a fantasy storyline that kept us begging for more. Now, ""9"", the feature film, is precisely what we've been waiting for. It's an hour-long extension of the short film we saw three years ago, with the same basic plot and more refined characters...and, most notably, with some of the best CGI you've ever seen.Critics around the country have criticized the storyline of the film as being too simple and a tad uninvolving, but I assure you this isn't so. True, it doesn't scream ""originality"" out at you, and the message it sends out to the audience isn't as effective as it could have been, but it's an incredibly entertaining plot that is bound to enthrall those who haven't seen the 2006 short film, and is bound to please fans of the original. The reason it disappoints some critics is the expectations they had towards the film. I mean: you mix Shane Acker and his ingenious short story, you add the legendary Tim Burton with his surprising imagination, and you top it off with Timur Bekmambetov (the director of ""Wanted"") who I consider to be the king of plot twists. What do you expect to get? You expect a ground-breaking, original, innovative, mesmerizing and unforgettable movie experience. What do you actually get? An amazing movie that's fun, entertaining and that boasts imagination, but that really isn't all that great, or whose creators don't manage to live up to their reputation with.But that's the only thing that I could criticize about the film- the fact it didn't turn out to be as mind-blowing as I expected. On the other hand, it is a joy to watch. The special effects are one of a kind, the artistry of the mechanical monsters and inventions is brilliant, and most of all, the thrilling action sequences will have you begging for more. As a matter of fact, the entire movie is a mélange of thrill chases, explosions, magical battles, etc, with a few seconds in between each to develop some dialogue. This isn't too much of a downside to the film, because even though the action overshadows the characters, we never stop caring for them. And a good thing is that, throughout the film, many questions will come to mind- trivial, small details which seem off or which aren't explained- questions to which you can come up with your own answer; by the end of the film you've created your own theories about practically everything in the plot, and you feel satisfied.Normally, I'm a very demanding critic when it comes to story and originality, but this is the kind of film you just sit back and enjoy, especially because of the fantasy and visual effects you see on the screen, regardless of whether the story is powerhouse or not. And compared to other substandard and off-putting animated films we've had in recent years, this blows them all away. Like I said before, it's bound to be one of the most memorable animated films of 2009, especially because of the ingenious CGI and artistry. Go see it, and let yourself be entertained! Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",9

I enjoy the apocalypse element of the film and the grim look of the world our characters are set in. I was expecting something very cool to come out this film the second this movie started, and I got some of that. The characters I really liked and how they solve problems and do things are very cool. However, this movie is flawed. The story is very simple and there was weird moments that through me off. Moments that seemed to be almost coincidental or just very strange. I understand being strange and out there is an element for this movie, but some thing kinda just crossed the line for me. The backstory is enjoyable and I absolutely love the commentary behind it. Everything else is fine and passable, 8/10.",9
112,dfwforeignbuff,UInique and enjoyable sci fi animated but short on plot.,7,22 January 2010,"9 originally a short subject by Shane Acker, a student at UCLA, it was nominated for a 2006 Oscar. The film is clearly in the tradition of his mentor Tim Burton. What if Toy Story took place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? And all the toys were designed by that bad neighbor kid? Plot: 9 is a little burlap doll with watch parts for innards. When 9 first comes to life, he finds himself in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are gone, and it is only by chance that he discovers a small community of others like him taking refuge from scary machines that roam the earth intent on their extinction. Despite being the new one in the group, 9 convinces the others that hiding will do them no good. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover why the machines want to destroy them in the first place. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them. It is a good flick but the plot leave us with little real explanation of what is going on except the world has been destroyed and there is a bad guy (thing) and these little burlap doll things still around. The small community gets divided into factions over the war they are fighting. These survivors go on a journey to unlock the secret to their existence, while dodging and fighting the killing machines responsible for exterminating the planet and its life. The script is simple and predictable. The film has a unique visual style. For an animated feature places things appear very real. Dark plot. Really not for children. This is more of an adult Sci-fi animated film. Gives us a really creepy, menacing atmosphere. A short 79 minutes. Entertaining and worth seeing. This Sci-fi adventure is a treat for mature audience animation and science-fiction fans. The film is similar to Wall-E another sci fi tale of the animated machine in a destroyed world but 9 never achieves that films storytelling greatness. It is still an enjoyable film.",9
113,csagne,"Not for kids, not for grown ups, and full of holes",3,12 September 2011,"3 That's for the CGI and actors' voices.SPOILERS BEGIN The issue I see is that if 9 had not done anything and gotten rid of the beast, then what? The machine does not wake up, and then?What about the end when the machine is gone? OK, a few rag dolls own the earth, and what? They are objects, they can't reproduce.With the too obvious reuse of Matrix / Terminator imagery, this is not for kids below 11. But after 11 they can't get the references to Frankenstein and fascism. So push it to 16, and then they're no longer interested in rag dolls. Later then? Then adults are finding the story silly. So this story tried to walk on both sides of the road and ended up ran over.The set design is nice, very Tim Burton-esque, steam-punk, and presents an alternate 1940's earth, fair enough.But again what would have happened if the machine had never woken up? Well in fact then, we wonder why the inventor said his doll would save the world, there was after all at that point only one cat sized beast he could have destroyed himself.As for the coin sized device which is the central plot item, we are left wondering how he (the inventor) managed to get hold of it if it used to be on the machine (as the machine used to be operational and no longer is, we need to assume it used to be there).Whatever. Don't watch this, watch the trailer on the internet and skip.",9

115,mrtimlarabee,Story not quite as strong as the visuals,6,16 September 2009,"""9"" has a scary imaginative landscape. It doesn't appear to be the future so much as an alternate reality, as told by film clips detailing the invention of these machines designed to aid humanity. The visuals are the lure for the film. The world is dark and vast. The creators take advantage of the main characters' size to bring detail to their world.The only sentient characters are the rag dolls. I dare not give away how they are created, because that deals with the film's central themes. The characters aren't nearly as interesting as they look. For a PG-13 film, these characters seem like stock characters from run of the mill animated fare. The young newcomer, the holier than thou leader, the strong guy, and of course the one girl. Despite this, they have a good foundation to be interesting, but the creators never bother to take them to that level.The film is about 80 minutes and the first half is filled with the rag doll's fighting off evil machines. This is great eye candy, but doesn't really help establish a story. The story itself doesn't seem to get underway to the very end. Had the characters been a tad more captivating early on, I wouldn't mind. The film's theme is somewhat imaginative, if a little forced. There's a lot of heart towards the end of the movie, something the first half of the film lacks. This is an imaginative looking movie, but seems to lack a certain fullness to be recommended beyond the rich visuals.",9
116,www-jats,The Best Movie 09,7,19 January 2010,"I come from the school of early Tim Burton, and Jim Henson- two of my cinema deities from my earliest memories- and this is the first time in a long time that anyone has managed to touch on that magic for me.I'll do my best to convey what a fantastic movie this is, without really revealing too much of the plot- because I think that this movie is best experienced not really knowing anything. You come in the same way the main character does- not knowing anything of this world.While sitting in the theater, I recalled memories of the intensity and heart of ""my first movies"" such as E.T., The Secret of Nymh, The Dark Crystal, and Edward Scissorhands- movies that touched upon something that was at once so rooted in human emotion yet so fantastic and unimaginable. I can absolutely say that ""9"" is now considered one in that catalog of visionary and hallowed movies.Guaranteed some will have a complaint with the length (a seemingly short 79 minutes considering the scale and impact of the story) but I think that a movie can be an epic without needing to be over 2 hours long, or a HUGE amount of unnecessary back story and origins that's only purpose is to make the story SEEM grandiose. This movie is a complete work of art- from the obviously eye-catching visual style and composition of what you see, down to the basic story and character development that you feel. In 79 minutes this team managed to harness my imagination and senses without having to dumb-it-down for the audience, or use any of the old gags that many bigger studios seem to rely on to sell tickets (thankfully there are NO cheesy gross out jokes to appeal to a typical cable-fed attention span). Instead they took me to places that I had never thought of, but will never forget. My most respectful nod to everyone involved.Absolutely do not miss this one.",9
117,zurnderrick,"Bizarre, yet bitter sweet film.",9,8 September 2009,"Tim Burton is known for his wacky, and out of this world film atmosphere, and his latest film, 9 is no different. It is a weird,bizarre film that was creatively made, and surely has it's ups and it's downs, but overall, it's a satisfying tale to tell.This film features the incredible voices of Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, Crispin Glover, and many more. The score by Danny Elfman is also no different from any average Burton film, but has that creative, edgy like feeling to it. The film is also supported by it's story, and how the stitchpunks must work together to fight off the forces of evil.Overall, 9is a pretty good film, and met most of my expectations, but if you are going into the theater looking for a good action movie, you may be disappointed. This film is far different from any other Tim Burton flick, but surely isn't the black sheep of the Burton films, that would be Planet of the Apes in my opinion.",9

A group of rag dolls with a number from 1-9 on their backs are living in a post-apocalyptic world and battling robotic monsters. This is the plot of the movie and the idea is creative but the way it is presented is extremely uninteresting. Although the running time is only 79 minutes, I was begging for it to end within the first half hour. I don't have much else to say about this movie other than, although the voice actors are well-known and it is produced by Tim Burton, the film is unpleasant and not worth watching. If only every aspect of it were as good as the animation. Judy Garland's ""Over the Rainbow"" ironically made it in there which was a nice touch but not enough to redeem it.",9

Who ever complained about it not having a story, tell that to the crowd I saw jumping every so often from the intense confrontations. What I also liked about it was the hidden parts of the story. They give you enough information to enjoy the film but yet you can extract more of the back ground thought that went into what we saw in the completed film. For the first time ever I saw half of the audience stay behind after the credits role to not just see who worked on the movie but to debate back and forth about what they thought of it, what the characters represented, what happen in this or that scene, and of course the animation style and technique and how it moved them.

I adored the design of the characters but I might just be bias due to my love for the Little Big Planet game series. The story was great but I feel like it should have been longer. Now of course I've said that about a lot of the movies I've reviewed lately but despite this movie telling it's story well I couldn't help but notice that it felt short and left some interesting things unexplored. Like in all honesty the story was so interesting they could have easily explored more of it just to extend the length of the movie which I'm confident no one would complain about.

Exposition was given to us in acceptable doses. The characters were given a minimum of characterization, just enough to realize, and remember that there ARE indeed souls behind those clockwork eyes. Which, again, I'd like to see more of them. Perhaps even a sort of prequel (Which would omit the naive friend-killing 9) with the other 8 (And possibly finagle a few more in whatever plug-in plot you wish, even I can think of a few to justify more sackdolls).There's... little else to say.

He joins up with the rest of his kind, and struggles to find out his purpose. Each of the puppet character each have their own niche. The brave one, the inquisitive one, the selfish one, the strong one etc etc. The mechanical beasts seem to destroy everything including the little puppets, to what purpose?? Uhh... because they're evil?There is some sort of black magic in which a human gave the little puppets a human soul which is why they can laugh and care for each other. They don't really explain how. There is a special device which can transfer and capture the human essence of the dolls. The main beast, is a mechanical brain that can create other diabolical beasts to do it's bidding. It uses the device to ""eat"" the souls of the puppets. Why?? uh... because they taste good? The main problem with the film is that there are just too many plot holes that are not filled in. During the whole film you're trying to grasp the purpose and order of this fantasy world but just can't get your head around it b/c there's not enough information. The action sequences and creatures are all cool to look at but the story is just lacking. You never know why any of the creatures are doing what they're doing.

The story line is original in how each character has a distinct humanistic characteristic. I did not get it until the end of the movie, but that is the way I am. I watch a movie with the intensity of a young child watching the Christmas Tree on Christmas Eve. The evil that is portrayed has the loathing of a Terminator, but in a more simpler version. ""9"" reminded me of the ""War of The Worlds"" by H. G. Wells with the mechanical creatures wrecking havoc in our world. #9 is a likable character that just isn't satisfied with the way things are, but the way they should be.

Directed by Shane Acker. Written by Pamela Pettler and Shane Acker
It has been a while since I sat down to watch a movie. I don't know if you know this or not but I'm a cinephile. I love movies but sometimes I need a break from the relentlessness of movies. It can get to be the same old same old sometimes. Case in point guess what came out in cinemas this week.... That's right The Lion King done again almost exactly the same only the animals have no expressions and everything seems a bit more lifeless. Thanks for that. No I have not seen the movie yet but that's not what we're talking about here is a 2009 animated film which kind of came and went despite it looking visually fascinating. I'm talking about 9, the movie about sentient garbage dolls in a post apocalyptic wasteland fighting a giant scary robot monster and trying to survive.The story is very simple. Nothing wrong with simplicity in a story. When you have such a wild world and characters like this, a simple story is a good thing. I'm not willing to make it as a negative in this case. It is more a survival story. You learn that these creations will do anything to survive. Their survival negates the need for in depth character study. We learn a brief bit about them but when you learn about the source that they're searching for, you'll understand why they represent one aspect of a larger personality.Visually it is magnificent. It was a good juxtaposition with the Lion King. It shows how much can be done with animation. We want things to be so realistic in our animation that we're missing out on what it can do. 9 is an excellent example of what animation is capable of. It makes you fear for the genuine safety of sentient puppets essentially. They fear for their lives. They don't know any world other than this one. This hellscape where the sky has permanently been darkened. If it isn't grey, it has an orangish look to it. The machine that the source created to help the world but instead killed it. This monstrous machine is genuinely terrifying. It is a marvelous creation in that respect.This was a solid enjoyable film. It is a beautiful nightmare. It is a simple story told with verve and excitement and terror. It is worth seeing for the experience of seeing it. At least just once. I give this movie a B.",9
128,faisal_khatib,Never a wasteland has looked so beautiful on the big screen.,7,1 May 2010,"Last night as a last minute decision, I decided to go for the movie '9'. I had first seen the trailer during the US box office countdown on MBC 2 all the way back in November 2009. The concept looked interesting and I had ticked it off as a movie I would watch in the theater. I looked it up on IMDb and being Co-produced by Tim Burton was enough information for me to understand that '9' is going to be a very different movie and I wasn't disappointed.9 (voiced by Elijah Wood) is a rag doll that awakens in a post apocalyptic future scarred by a war between Humans and Machines that has destroyed the world including all of humanity. He finds a small group of rag dolls like him who are constantly threatened by a beast that looks like a mechanical dog. The story revolves around how 9 rescues 2 (voiced by Martin Landau) who he initially meets with the help of 5(voiced by John C. Reilly) and 7(voiced by Jennifer Connelly) while in the process awakens a more fearsome machine called the Brain. The brain is a machine that was created by man to built machines by using it's own superior intelligence. Obviously terminator style, the machines turn on humans and the rest is well history. 9 convinces the others to destroy the Brain instead of hiding and waiting for it to hunt them down. I won't go more in detail cause well you should go watch it.Coming to what I thought about the movie. Well we've already established that being a Tim Burton movie it had to be different and it was in my opinion but I was expecting more. The story was very vague and character development could have been better but that in my opinion let the audience fill in the gaps with their own imagination which went well cause the movie was from the point of view of the rag dolls who themselves didn't know why they existed and what they had to do. What disappointed me a little was that director Shane Acker was hesitant to push the envelope which shows cause the movie was a mere 80minutes long including the end credits. He could have stunned the audience with a different story line but instead choose to give the movie a bit of soul (literally) which was good but could have been better. What in the end really makes the movie stand out is the spectacular visual display that Shane Acker has created. Never a wasteland has looked so beautiful on the big screen. It was CGI at its best.All in all it was money well spent...",9
129,Apemangalore,A solid film that doesn't live up to its full potential,6,13 September 2009,"Aside from perhaps The Princess and the Frog (and, prior to May 29th, Up), there hasn't been a single movie this year that I've been looking forward to more than Shane Acker's debut film, 9. The basic premise, while somewhat familiar, really intrigued me, and the art direction looked superb. Along with a decidedly darker tone than most animated films, this one definitely looked like it had potential to be one of the all-time greats. But does 9 live up to its full potential? Wellnot quite.On the positive side (and as one would guess from the trailers), the movie looks spectacular. By use of both the environments and the characters, this harsh, post-apocalyptic world feels extremely real, and successfully draws you into the film. I simply couldn't take my eyes off of the art on display here.The voice acting is also relatively solid. Jennifer Connelly as 7, the strong-willed warrior of the group, and Christopher Plummer as 1, the gang's self-proclaimed leader, are especially terrific in their roles.As much as the visuals draw you into the film, and as strong as the voice acting is, though, the story feels pretty bland, and in fact, is littered with several gaping plot holes. The movie is also quite short, and with the majority of it centered on the action, I don't think I had enough time to connect with any of these characters. There was only one scene in which I truly felt attached to them, which was toward the end, with the song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" playing throughout. To me, as well as a few other people that I've spoken to, that was easily the best scene in the film.Overall, 9 is a thoroughly entertaining film with beautiful animation and a strong voice cast. Unfortunately, the story itself ends up being pretty dull, and not as complex as one might hope. It's still a solid film, and I look forward to whatever Shane Acker's next project is (animated or otherwise). However, it simply doesn't live up to the potential that I thought it had.",9
130,manikhero,It was totally Boring and no Fun,1,5 October 2009,"The movie was totally Boring and no Fun. And, the characters was not good and no comedy. And, there was no action and not a good story, And, the full movie is in the dark and none of them was cute. I think I wasted my time seeing this movie. And, it was a short movie also so it was less time to waste. And, the full movie was boring and I was yawning and was about to sleep, that much boring it was. First, when I saw the trailers of this movie i thought the movie is so cool, but after watching the full movie, I realized that the trailers fooled me. So, I think the creators of ""9"" will do their future animated movies better than this movie.",9

There should have been more plot development without so many action scenes. The nine dolls are supposed to succeed in a world where humans have failed. But how can they? They possess the same qualities, good and bad, that humans had. And they're 1/6 the size in a destroyed city. Good luck saving the world.The machines look like they were built with Erector sets and why do they have animal skulls?Forget about taking the kids. It's far too violent.",9
132,IllusionOfLife,Doesn't Live Up To Its Premise.,7,27 June 2011,"9 Rating: C 9, set in an alternate time line, takes place shortly after the events of World War II. A machine that was initially created for good ends up being abused by corrupt human leaders and eventually strikes back destroying all of humanity. However, a lone scientist creates a group of sentient rag dolls (dubbed Stitch-Punks by Shane Acker) to carry on one last shred of hope for the future. 9 is the final Stitch-Punk created by The Scientist. So I must say I was pretty excited for 9 when I stumbled across the teaser at apple.com way back at the beginning of the year; it looked like a very unique concept with cool action and an interesting animation style. I then found the original short film on YouTube, and also loosely followed the teaser site 9experiment.com (which I recommend going to before seeing the movie, at the very least read through The Scientist's journal, it'll give you some interesting insight into the back story). Anyway the movie finally came out and I was definitely curious to see how it would be handled. Unfortunately, it was not as good as either the trailers or the original short film. Don't get me wrong, there were a lot of cool aspects to the movie and I think Shane Acker made a good start at expanding the story from the short film but unfortunately the way the story played out it felt more like they were working from an outline rather than a finished script. All the plot elements were good and fit together well but none really went deeper than the surface level here's what's happening. If this had been merely a longer short film (30-40 min) it would have been brilliant, but for a feature length film the story felt a little bit thin. I was also a little disappointed that this movie kind of invalidated the short film and there were definitely some decisions made in the story of the short film that I wished had been carried over to how the final film was made. Another thing that was disappointing was the reliance on dialogue, especially since the voice acting was at worst mediocre, and at best kinda good. The original short film was done using only the animation as the performance, and while I understand that there needed to be some dialogue I think that the story should have been told on a strictly visual level in most places. There were a few moments that had the potential to be akin to Pixar's level of artistry but were ruined by unnecessary speaking. On the positive note, the film was refreshingly unique, both in story and art direction. The story may not have been properly fleshed out but at it's core the story had a great concept. The staging of the animation was probably the strongest point of the movie, Shane Acker shows amazing potential as a director and the film had moments that bordered on pure cinematic art, again only held back by an over-abundance of dialogue or lack of time spent on the particular moment. It's a shame Shane Acker chose this as his first feature length piece because I feel that it would have been better for the movie if he had waited until he had a little more experience before he tackled 9. He most certainly shows potential as a filmmaker, however I think this story was beyond his level at this time. I will definitely be watching out for his future works and, although it would be unlikely, I would be very excited if he decided in the future to rework the film, using the film that was released now as sort of the foundation and building from there.",9

There were dozens of kids in the theater with us, I'd say from 8 on up, and none left because they were too frightened or too bored. I would be careful with your particular child: there are action scenes, vivid deaths, loud noises and creatures that as an adult I found rather disturbing. The previews are representative of the whole. That leads into the fact this was visually creative and wonderful. The animation and overall scene direction definitely carry this movie, I recommend seeing in a theater or with a large HD TV. The characters were a little flat. Once you learn their purpose you look back and think there could have been a few more scenes to flesh them out. You shouldn't be confused though, an adult with some experience with alternate history and sci-fi won't even be surprised. A child might need a little explanation. Same with the storyline: it took a while to get to the crux, kids might need a bit of help, but it was all there and understandable. It's a little weak, but the purpose of this film was the ""look"".

Then this film is definitely for you!Barely over an hour and barely filling that, 9 is an incoherent parable about the evils of science and technology — yet another machines-gone-bad apocalypse premise, and it goes downhill from there.Just about the only thing is has to offer is some interesting design and animation, but I didn't find the odd little rag-doll characters themselves interesting at all — just odd. Supposedly they were animated by the soul of the scientist who created them, but they didn't seem to have any soul to me: they were as flat as characters can get, their interactions meaningless. None of them changed, none of them had anything interesting to say or do. They weren't cute or funny, or really anything at all.And the story is just not there: it's just a series of Rube-Goldberg-esquire battles with evil robots stitched together by arbitrary and obscure motivations. It's never really clear why anything is happening. ""We must get the thingamabob from the monster robot."" Okay. Whatever. It's powerful. It's a ... well, it's a powerful thingamabob. And the bad robot has it. Better get it back, I guess! Or something! Should only take about an hour ...It's just an hour, but don't waste your time on 9.",9
136,Cinemadharma,"Gorgeously dark, steampunkish, dystopian visuals marred by a dumbfoundingly nonsensical story",5,10 September 2009,"Gorgeously dark, steampunkish, dystopian visuals along with an agreeable allegorical message, are marred by a story that makes so little sense it will make your head spin.The main problem with the film can be boiled down to its story, which, to directly quote my brother's review: ""at 79 Minutes, it was either 70 minutes too long or 1 hour too short"". And given the fact that this film began as an 11 minute Oscar nominated short, this makes perfect sense. I won't go into the details here of why almost nothing in the film made sense, because it would require me to 'spoil' the movie. But if you see the film and by some miracle you are able to make logical sense of the story details, please get back to me, and then after we determine how high you were when you saw it, we'll debate it.It's really too bad. The animation and general creative vision really is stunning. And for me, the film carries a message I am totally on board with. On the top level, it is essentially an allegory about the harnessing of atomic energy and how it promised progress and benefit to humankind, but also has resulted in weapons of unimaginable destruction. Further, it can be said that this can be applied to much of the 'progress' in science and technology in the 20th and 21st centuries. Discoveries and advances have immense potential for being of great benefit, but also to do great harm – and ultimately which direction they go in is completely determined by the human element. Digging into the allegory a little deeper, the film poses interesting questions regarding a Creator who in creating beings in his image has designed both good and evil beings, and who both gives life and takes away life.Bottom line: A beautifully dark vision, a message worthy of contemplation, decent vocal performances, a very disappointing score with a dumbfoundingly nonsensical story.",9
137,Rafacus,A dark but beautiful offering of CGI.,7,9 September 2009,"A dark but beautiful offering of CGI about a post-apocalyptic world and 9 humanoid robots with a mysterious mission to carry out. Shane Acker directs this movie although the trailers and signs all point to the more popular Tim Burton. To top off this confusion (Burton produced it) we are shown creatures that play more than a little homage to A Nightmare Before Christmas. But even though Shane Acker directs it, for the Burton loving audience, 9 will not disappoint. I will however warn you that before you see it, be sure to be alert, awake and attentive because this isn't your run-of-the-mill, so simple a 9 yr old could have wrote it, story. This is a complex, decide for yourself, watch and pay attention type of story in a nice CGI coat that may fool you that it is a children story.Starting out with the scientist (Alan Oppenheimer) crafting the future protagonist 9 (Elijah Wood), we are given a clue that the world has gone all to hell, and the all too familiar theme of machines taking over comes to play. 9 is a curious creature, a sack-boy with mechanical parts, he is adorable but not in a teddy bear kind of way, we are shown a bit of innocence in him which contrasts his world that looks very much like the aftermath of a war. At one part in the film we are shown the marching of soldiers to a dictator whose symbol and gait echo a resemblance to Adolph Hitler of World War 2. The steam punk influence combined with the 1940s style of art makes the world foreign but familiar and even with the flashbacks and the hints, the world of 9 just never feels like our world to me. As the movie progresses, 9 runs into the other 8 members of his tiny robot race, all being named after their respective numbers and each having a dramatically different personality from the other.The toughest and probably my favorite of the lot was the only female (I could tell from the voice), the mask wearing, blade wielding 7 (Jennifer Connelly). Numbers 1 (Christopher Plummer) and 2 (Martin Landau) were the eldest and number 8 (Fred Tatasciore) was the typical strong oaf. 5 (John C. Reilly) was the loving and innocent healer of the bunch and 6 (Crispin Glover) was an artist. The twins 3 and 4 never talk but loved to chronicle and record events to playback for the others. The bad guys as you may have guessed by now were the machines. The flawed inventions of man who turned on their masters and decimated the human race.The tale of 9 is one that has been in film since the original Metropolis with the robot version of Maria leading the overworked serfs to destroy the very machinery that kept their world running. Most of us may remember The Matrix which echoed the same tale of the renegade machine. Terminator also comes to mind with Skynet and many others. The unique thing about this story however is it isn't left up to some dark haired human to save the human race. This dark tale wipes us out and places the future in the hands of tiny machines the size of your hand. The story of 9 is a dark, dark one with a very bleak outlook for humanity and our ability to self-destruct. Within the world of 9 lays the debris and remnants of war and death. The corpses of the fallen lay strewn about, the sky has a steady flow of dark clouds and things die as naturally as they appear on screen.As much as I loved this story, I wish I could have had a bit more. The team of 9 are each love-able in their own right but we are left to our own theories about their history. Nothing is explained to the audience outside of the reasoning for their existence, we get no personal background stories or grand flashbacks of happy times. This is why you should flex your creative muscles when viewing it, since the movie spans only 79 minutes, we are given the raw outline and forced to make do with what we have. For me this was enough and I thought 9 to be a well paced story about a very, very dark time. I would not recommend this for young children and I would think that the PG-13 rating would clue you in on that. But for the big kids and sci-fi loving adults, I would urge you to get out there and see it.More reviews from me at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com.",9

So I expected the same thing from the movie.Where I was right, where I was wrong?True, ""9"" isn't your next Disney Pixar whole-family movie. It's basically a sci-fi tale with lots of suspense and action violence. Only almost no humans in it...True, ""9"" amazes with great animation, details, new ideas, originality, that's its strongest attribute!The problem is, even though there is lots of action, and the movie is only 79minutes long the story starts to bore you somewhere in the middle, when you already get used to the stunning animation.I agree that the ending is cheesy, but still it is very emotional and I liked it.I also missed some more ""rock"" guitar based style soundtrack, like from the trailer. Think that would fit here perfectly... too bad, but the OST itself is not bad either.To sum up, ""9"" delivers some amazing animation (here, better than UP in my opinion), and great action sequences but the story and screenplay is not that exciting as it could have been.",9

Of course, the great Animator of Prague would have done the whole thing in stop-motion rather than CG, but I don't hold that against ""9""; it works. But where ""9"" falls down is in the dialog. If this same story had been told in pantomime, or in some made-up language (or even Czech?), certain holes in the plot would have slipped by unnoticed. Why DID 9 place the talisman in the Machine? Was it necessary to bring the machine to life just so it would have to be destroyed again? If there were no intelligible dialog trying to make sense of this, we would never realize that in fact it makes little or no sense at all.

The characters are all types and none had overly strong individual personalities, but I really liked the flawed nature of the titular character and his sense of personal responsibility for what goes wrong in the world.The plot is also fairly linear and holds few surprises, but while simple, it was never stupid.

I was pleased with the pacing, the camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, kinda bland. Plot? It sucked.This movie seemed more new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science isn't portrayed any better. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything... but ""souls"" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really?That's something that bites my ass a bit too. Here we have a CGI movie... created with science... and they're using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask,""Okay, so now what?"" (or something similar). I couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit. It was a ""okay... it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!"" type of exit.This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily. Any thought as to, ""what's the point of that?"" will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing.Okay... SPOILERS follow.So, basically, a scientist creates ""the Machine"" that is capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he is also at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but didn't give it his heart. The Machine goes Skynet on humanity's collective ass and wipes out all life on earth, finally slowly powering down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock-puppets. Each one, containing a piece of the scientist's soul.The last one, #9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets up with another like himself, #2. Well, #2 gets captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. #9 finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue #2. They succeed.#9 notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine comes back to life... pulling out #2's soul in the process.The movie then continues with action scenes with #9 trying to rescue his soul-yanked compatriots. They eventually succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who go up into the clouds. It then rains and we see life returning back to the planet.Hunh?!?That makes no sense. None at all. Why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into 9 homunculi? What did it accomplish? Were they created to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why bother?!?Why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a ""soul"" to fight the first.. at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success.Why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps?",9
144,captelephant,9 is a 6,6,10 September 2009,"9 is better than average... but only barely.The movie is carried by a unique visual style and a great sense of ""place."" The sack-men (and woman) are refreshingly odd and fun to watch. The post-apocalyptic city is consistently beautiful and dangerous. Desolate without feeling dull.Unfortunately, the story and characters ARE dull. Not crushingly so... but enough to frustrate. Frequent, obvious plot holes and violations of established world-rules pulled me out of the movie over and over again. Tired clichés abound. I wasn't able to shake the feeling that I'd seen and heard this all before.And that's a shame because there's a lot of potential here. If only the writer had taken more chances. Why not challenge the audience and defy expectations? Why make a movie that's too scary for kids but too simplistic for adults? Who is expected to enjoy it? I would watch another Shane Acker movie if one is made (hopefully after he's picked a target audience). But 9 is not a classic.... that said, it's probably worth watching on the big screen just for the sights and sounds.",9
145,carter-47153,Our Future,8,24 August 2015,"The world of the film, 9 is a bleak and desolate one. It is one in which all the life, hope and empathy that humanity at it's best has to offer is at it's best nonexistent. It is a world that is a barren wasteland and the spark of life has dimmed. In which life is reduced down to survival and everything else becomes secondary.In a future where mankind has destroyed itself through technology, irresponsibility and deception. Before his death, a lone scientist imparts nine elements of himself into nine rag dolls. The nine dolls band together in an act of survival. They attempt to make a life together though a series of events occurs that forces the youngest to confront the oldest doll in a conflict of values.As the story progresses the audience is exposed to the facts of the demise of the world of humanity. They are shown that it is through humanity's arrogance that an artificial intelligence was built and that humanity had an inability to respect their creation and to coexist with it. While this is a plot setup that has been done in other films, 9 does it in a unique way.It is through the struggles of the rag dolls within their world that we learn that those that come before us do not always prepare us for the life that we face. The world that anybody comes to live in is predetermined by those that came before and it is up to those descendants to reclaim the world in a manner that honors the spirit intended.This goal is not easily accomplished and usually needs sacrifice. It is a goal that requires groups of people to band together and find a way to be better than each one individually. Only then can the sins of the fathers be put right and allow life to flourish once more.",9
146,mrloughrie,9 (Dollars of my Money Wasted),4,27 March 2016,"Nine was just awful, critics thought it was OKAT, I thought it was probably one of the worst movies of all time, and it doesn't seem to catch my attention.The biggest problem is something a rookie director would make, and I don't mind the outstanding visuals.The huge problem is it is Horribly fast paced. At the beginning, you are shown a clip of 9 being created, and then it shows the creator dying. After that, he goes out in the streets and already meets a new member, and only 5 minutes in, there is an action scene when the monster comes and takes the other guy he met, and then he leaves. That's just 5 minutes, now, the movie shows a telescope of 9 walking forward and then he falls, he wakes up in a room and he is being stitched together by a new friend. (and only 10 minutes in) He meets number 8 and number 1. Also, there is poor character development, you only see that he is a total wiener. And quite old. Then you meet what I believe is 6, and he's really addicted to the source. Now what about 7? 7 was believed to be dead and they meet 7 while they looked for the guy the monster took, and 7 appears while they're being attacked, how could you meet a friend after 10,000 years after they were believed to be dead? Wow, how stupid.But, the movie is so bad, and so poorly crafted, it has that so-bad-its-good kind of feeling that makes you want to keeping on watching the awfulness. One final note: Voice acting was cancer, and so was the dialog.",9
147,racker-5,It Stays With You,8,24 October 2009,I wasn't exactly sure what to expect out of 9. I still don't know exactly how I feel. All I know is that it moved me. I was actually crying at the end of the film. The visuals were stunning and very surreal. The plot is definitely a unique one. The ending is one that I just can't get over. I was surprisingly touched. I saw this movie about 4 weeks ago--and yet I waited to comment because I wasn't sure what to write about it. I think it's a movie that you'll have to see several times to fully understand. I know that I'll have to watch it again to fully wrap my mind around the concept. I think it's definitely a movie to see if you are a deep thinker. 9 is so much more than beautiful animation. It's a story that speaks to the soul--and stays with you.,9

Nonetheless, it is a curve that continues to confront daily. On the keenest of days, nature unwraps humanity's caution. Total prosperity does occur but not guaranteed. Though natural disruption is not a huge cause for worry—basic human instincts rouse the need for concern as privileges of power to the inwardly unstable are catastrophic.With the glimpse 9 offers on a such and interweaving situations, the human contend takes hold. Based on a warring period Germany, when they had superior technology, it is a contact upon animated alternate history. A transcendental scientist succeeds at making a mechanical brain with human-like capabilities—until military interference. Once seized, the mechanoid is inflected with world control and domination —a setting from which it is almost impossible detracting it from.World of havoc, war, metal, and discord—all organic life has been wiped off. It is built on a Steampunk, Futurepunk directory; this post apocalyptic world—with the old world still technologically upending— is a shot into an unyielding unfolding future with the punks following a devoid direction.Opening up to statutes in their perfect sculpt, The Mad Mane Machine retraces Wells' the time traveler arising to the same in a distant future. Much with its Star Trek allusions as Seven of Nine gets a centre-stage presence—saving a sinking ship. Another moment of Wellsian descent yields itself in the hall of retrieval and archiving, from the time traveler's escapades. Dusty, decrepit, and devoid of life—a towering structure of decaying records. Collective hands are involved in the tid-bit gathering needed to destroy the enemy gladiatorial force.From the recollected manuscripts the scientist gave his life for— much to foresee mechanical defeat—the same electric eye mechanism that gobbles and destroys is the same that takes part in disintegrating the hub of the bug hive-mind.9 is akin to degraded Steampunk with alternative Cyberpunk sheddings —or primitive Cyberpunk in its best description. Arising technology that fails to boom once the ultimate breakthrough culminates to unmitigated corruption. It purges a lot as a disaster film—once salvaged to savagery the survivors have zero option to figure out to turn the best of their fate. Spiritual aspects of transcendentalism leave an un-rooted gap on the plane of escapism but given the rushed connections to keep the story linked and running it should pass as a ground to ignore",9

Let me say first why you need to see this movie: because it is about hope and humanity; because it is about solidarity; because it is about the dangers of war and lethal weapons. Now about the atmosphere: it is a post-apocalyptic world, which is the future of a past different from ours, with a fight between man and machine.

150,jymwrite-1,One of The best Movies of 09!,8,7 January 2010,"9 is a burlap man, he wakes to find himself in a laboratory, the humans around him dead and the world we know has suffered an apocalypse. 9 goes out into the world and soon finds friends like him numbered 1 through 8. Together they discover the secret of how the world was destroyed and the reason for their existence while battling ""The Machine."" As the numbers struggle for survival they come to realize that each of them has a piece of the answer to the riddle of their world and they each other.The characters are computer generated, and the characters are more like sock puppets but you find yourself very quickly forgetting that and you start to care about the characters, their plight, their safety, their concerns. Each character is developed as fully as it can, even a couple characterizations that could have safely remained clichés like that of 8, who is a bully and enforcer of 1 is later shown to have some quite human attributes and when the machines attack it is 8 who leaves all differences behind and uses his brawn to save the others. The other characterization that could have remained a cliché is that of ""The Machine"" it could have been a static Darth Vader like symbol of that is bad and evil, but even the ""The Machine"" is shown to have been at one point an innocent that has it's use and functions corrupted.9 is one of the most pure film-making experiences I've had in a long time. 9 started life as a 7-8 minute animated short by Shane Acker. The short didn't have speaking parts, characterization was delivered through expression and body language and 9 the feature film carries on that original intent, although not totally wordless a lot of subtle, nuanced points are shown subtly with expression, tone, body language, and doesn't overly rely on the human actors who voice the characters. And the actors who do voice the characters do an excellent job. Christopher Plummer, Crispin Glover, Martin Landau, Jennifer Connelly, Elijah Wood all seem to be the perfect casting for the roles.I read some of the other reviews that suggested 9 is a kids movie, but it doesn't seem to be. Yes, the characters are cute and would seem to have great merchandising potential, bit the world revealed in the movie has some depth to it and And if you want to let your kids see the movie, I wouldn't hesitate the darker elements aren't that dark probably less than the average Disney movie and aren't horrific or traumatizing for younger viewers.There are plenty of bonus features and they are all around excellent. There are a lot of behind the scenes looks at the creation of the movie talking with everyone from Shane Acker who created the original short and directed the feature. Production designers of every ilk talk about their participation in the movie but it's never boring or too technical. The bonus features include the original short the movie is based on.As a reviewer you find that good books or movies generate a lot of ideas, questions, and thought as you watch or read, 9 does that extraordinarily well. After watching 9 I think you'll find yourself satisfied with the experience. The only thing I regret is, I wish I had seen this movie before now.",9
151,Trelloskilos,Definitely not worth a '9'....,5,15 March 2010,"What is it with CGI animators? I realise that things have come a long way from Toy Story, and we will always have the Dreamworks/Disney Pixar rivalries, but CGI animation is becoming more & more depressing. I'm not sure who he target audience of this film would be, and that is the big problem.The majority of CGI movies nowadays seem to know it's target audience pretty well. Young kids, and parents who have to watch the movie with kids. Take a look at any successful CGI movie, and the formula is the same. Colourful characters, snappy dialogue, and a few risqué jokes that adults will chuckle at, and kids won't get. 9 has absolutely none of that.I do not think it is a kid's movie by any stretch of the imagination. OK, it's CGI, there are a lot of cutesy characters (mostly borrowing from a narrow range of stereotypes), but the movie is colourless, the subject matter (post-apocalyptic survival, loss of humanity over technology etc.), not to mention several death scenes, scary adversaries, and very little by way of humorous dialogue, would alienate most kids.I can't see it working as an adult's film either. It's too formulaic. You almost know exactly what is going to happen, and which of the group of 'Little Big Planet' rejects will not make it to the end.As with most big budget animations, the artwork & rendering are top-notch, but the premise is too bleak to allow for any development. All the locations look pretty much the same, (and unfortunately, so do many of the characters). The story takes a back seat to action scenes, and overlong periods of overt displays of CGI mastery until about half-way through the film, but by then it's too late, and the explanations for the existence of the sack-boys, and of the world is dealt with all in 30 seconds, before we are back to more action scenes and doe eyed puppets.OK, I will grant that I am presuming all CGI movies must be aimed at kids. I understand this shouldn't be the case. After all, Watership Down, & Animal Farm were examples of animation which were not really that child-friendly, but at least there was an elememt of morality with the tales they told. '9' doesn't really resolve itself that well, and it does end with a very nasty cliché.Nice try, but there are better CGI movies that both adults AND kids can enjoy out there.",9

153,sagar272,Best Way to Present Modern Rise Of The Machines Against HumansGreat CG!!!,10,13 March 2010,"When 9 (Elijah Wood) first comes to life, he finds himself in a post- apocalyptic world. All humans are gone, and soon he discovers a small community of similar Rag Dolls like him taking refuge from fearsome machines whose motive is their mere extinction. Despite being the neophyte of the group, 9 shows a character of courage convinces the others that hiding will do them no good and they need to fight back. They must take the offensive if they are to survive, and they must discover the mystery to why the machines want to destroy them. As they'll soon come to learn, the very future of civilization may depend on them.To begin with I can say stunning CG for a concept like this. The movie basically enlightens the rudimentary concept of war between Human and the Machines backed up by Super Computer which has a brain of its own. Well viewers have been through a lot of similar saga's any but actually representing the Rise of the machines without presence of Human is quiet indispensable fact. The story seems to start from the mid which cant said to be a draw back as the director might wanted to depict the same, no animals absolutely no sign of any kind of human activity not even bugs. Perfect post apocalypse site with these group of dolls left without any hint or means of survival script doesn't depict the actual war or reason of Destruction but only bits and pieces of flashbacks here and there supporting the theory. Any how glancing into the climax one notices perfect plot for a good movie fine story here about bravery in the face of adversity, intelligent heroes, clever plot twists, and a few narrow escapes. The main attraction is found is that the script has left a little bit something to unfold at the end which most of the apocalyptic war movies miss out, answering so as to why these dolls have come to existence and so as to what purpose they serve. Talking about the CG here Starz Animation Toronto has done quiet a job heresmooth animation, fine abstracts, even though camera movements seemed rigid at a few places I don't have any clue so as to how. Summing up very fine movie to watch never seen such a fine animated movie with a strong script before strongly advisable to watch.My rating 9.3 out of 10.",9

The graphics are stunning... every fiber of the rag dolls stands out, and attention to superficial detail is very good. But that is all I will say in favour of the movie.The plot is extremely common, the storyline novice, hilarious if i may say. A rag doll wakes up and knows everything about how to do things !! that's a thing too far fetched. And the slow story )even though the timeline is small) doesn't help. Add to that, poorly written dialogues, and... you get the idea...I am giving it a 5 star rating just because of the graphics.

156,zizumia,Pretty well made,9,9 September 2012,"I quite enjoyed this film. Great animation, the plot made quite sense, and the characters were pretty well thought out. I personally loved the imagination put in it, even though it seemed more based off of the fact of human nature more than made up. The scenery was more like a very high-tech version of Nazi Germany with a Chancellor that portrayed himself on top, government flags hung everywhere, and buildings and cars that were typical of the 1940 era. The ""enemy"" robots were quite thought out too, yet the ""soldiers"" that really killed off all the humans looked more like the War of the Worlds machines. I personally like how the different ""puppets"" (or what they are called) portray the different parts of the Scientist's soul, and it was quite easy to depict the parts of human Character they represented. I also like how it points out how the ""big boss robot"" was made by the scientists soul, and like any human, it can be corrupted by being ""brainwashed"". The only thing that really bothered me was how quick they took out ""the final boss"". Seems like they got more lucky than anything when it came to defeating it, because I could personally see a machine that can wipe out the Human race can easily wipe out these puppet things. Then again, if they were wiped out, then there would be no story, and the plot would come to a useless end. I personally could have found it where it took longer, or they went through more struggles to defeat the robot, but, it was what it was. I personally enjoyed it, and I really liked the plot. I would recommend this to anyone, because it was quite well made.",9
157,sniperswagat,A visual feast,7,21 November 2009,"Shane Acker plunges into a full-length remake of his 2005 award winning short of the same name. An apocalyptic world is something Hollywood evidently loves, what with the recent release of 2012 and countless other apocalyptic adventures.The Plot: '9' is set in a post-apocalyptic world where all humans are extinct. We meet '9', a rag doll with life, given sentience by the humans. The purpose of this gift is unknown to us. The world around '9' is barren, lonely and scary. Corpses and debris fill the landscape, and there's an enemy around. The last of the machines is still activated, on a vicious mission to destroy any life forms.From the very outset, it is clear that this is not a feel-good animation movie for kids. It's dark and scary. At times, the story does feel predictable, but the innovative setting and slick action more than makes up for it. The roots of '9' lie closer to 'Terminator Salvation' than 'Wall-E'. What makes '9' different from other post-apocalyptic flicks is its strange set of characters/creatures. The last time a doll was the main character in a movie, Chucky was tearing up unsuspecting kids with a knife.The Visuals: Brilliant. The imagery on show is the best aspect of '9'. It wouldn't have counted for too much in any other film; but as it is an animation flick, you have to give it the plaudits it deserves. The landscape, the machines, the dolls; everything is extremely well-eked out.The Cast: It's hard to go wrong with actors like Christopher Plummer, Elijah Wood, Martin Landau and John C. Reilly. The voice acting is indeed very good, especially by Plummer in the patriarchal role of '1'. He brings an air of self-assumed grandeur to the character that you feel like shaking him by the scruff and making him listen to 9. Full credit must go to the cast for making the dolls believable.The Verdict: 9 is visually stunning, and has a good story to boot. Watch it on the big screen if you can, but do watch it.",9
158,clouded_eye,"Good, but not Great...",6,11 September 2009,"The biggest downfall of 9 is its total lack of character development. If the movie had just another 10-15 minutes for you to get to know the rag-doll characters, it would be much more enjoyable.As it stands, 9 is an entertaining post-apocalyptic action adventure story with an interesting twist on the man vs. machine theme.It just seems such a shame that a movie with this kind of potential falls flat because of something so major. Character development is key in a story like this. Especially when you're dealing with such a small group of characters to begin with.But, you really know nothing of the characters beyond what 9 himself knows. That's regrettable, especially with a powerhouse cast voicing every major player (at least those that really speak)...Character development aside, the movie is visually impressive, and does what any movie of this sort should do: expands and improves upon the short film from which it was sculpted. This year's other ""9er"" (District 9) did the same thing.The overall story is good, the writing is decent, and the action is undeniably some of the coolest ever in a CG animated film...Just a shame the characters are all so 2 dimensional in a 3d world...",9

It works well at being a film you can dip in and out of, have on in the background when doing things, or sitting down and taking it all in.It is both light and in depth, giving it appeal to all ages.We see all the usual emotions crammed into this film.Overall, very exciting easy going film offering many levels of enjoyment.

The Supreme Leader orders the creation of a thinking computer which is rather unimaginatively named The Machine. The Machine is mass-produced and pressed into battle, only to turn upon it's creators. The war ends when The Machines release a biological weapon that wipes out all life upon earth, even down to the lowliest microorganism, which explains why the bodies of the dead people have not decayed over time. Some years later a small rag doll robot known only as 9 awakens and sees the body of his creator upon the floor. Eventually he meets up with more of his own kind and they wage a series of running battles with several skeletal/mechanical monsters that have been created by the last surviving Machine. Ultimately the little robots face off against the Machine itself in a climactic battle...The effects of 9 are quite good, especially when it comes to depicting the dark world wherein the characters exist. However, even though the ads promise an epic battle between the forces of good and evil, the movie feels like the final pointless skirmish in a war whose outcome has long since been decided. What are the little robots fighting for? Humanity and even all life upon Earth are gone forever, and without any apparent means of replication the robots have no future of their own. Why not, as 1 suggested, just avoid the Machine and wait for it too to finally break down.

I'm not saying the plot they did have needed some rewriting, but they were missing a lot for what they had.Shane Acker lives up to his reputation he earned from WANTED, with plenty of action, but was clearly restricted by the animation and the slow plot.I think this movie could have been a high 7 or even and 8, but I will expect the rating to drop below 7 in the near future.

163,hellojaeson,Horrible Ending. Amazing Artwork.,4,31 October 2010,"There are already a lot of well written criticisms about this wonderfully artistic film.My write-up here is basically about the film's ending and how it contributed to the overall structural weakness of the entire movie.So let me start at the end by saying this: I didn't feel a thing when the end credits started materializing from a talisman for quite a few reasons.My thoughts kept returning to these questions:  Why did a scientist create these 9 little potato sack creatures from his soul?  And what did the sacks do as they live on in a world decimated by war? They hid in fear. They found a leader who is closed minded and authoritative.  So how were these soul-ful creatures supposed to help the world? They seemed incapable of helping each other... and this is great irony since they were all from one single soul. The question that arises is how can a world of souls co-exist if one single soul finds turmoil in getting along with itself?Suppose I play God's Advocate as opposed to Devil's Advocate... by suggesting that these little sack creatures were supposed to do for the planet what the huge war-like machines did not; i.e. to invent things that create positive changes rather than destroy the earth and all living things.And suppose they would do this because they were like machines with one key improvement... they had a soul.This ending, to some, would have been enough.However... it is overly simplistic since it blames all our planet's problems on the evil actions of machines. If machines were the sole problem, why do 3rd world countries suffer at all? The darker and less comforting truth is that our problems lie in ourselves. We humans are the problem. Not machines. We are the ones who hoard food. We are the ones who invent spears and clubs and knives and canons and missiles and rifles. We are the ones who steal from other humans using these weapons of destruction. Taking away someone's gun doesn't take away their ability to hurt other humans. Just look at life in prison. There are people there who can still kill and inflict damage on others with their hands, feet and teeth. Are we naive to believe that if we simply removed their hands and feet and teeth, prison life will suddenly turn into a human utopia. It isn't their weapons we must disarm. It is their hearts. Their selfsame human hearts that contain human souls. The same very souls that are supposed to help save humanity.So... If humans have a soul, and if souls have the ability to save the world... why isn't the world saved by humans today? We have over 3 billion humans with souls living right now. Don't we all have souls? Don't we all have the same souls (described in this movie '9') that are supposedly able to create positivity on our planet?These same souls are shown in the movie as being unable to agree on anything. If anything... this one single soul is responsible for killing parts of itself. Basically... the whole meaning for this movie sucked. The burlap sack creatures perhaps should have all killed themselves... gone to the sky and be done with it. Instead the scientist in the movie had said ""life must go on""... but why? Why should life go on when humans are incapable of peaceful co-existence? Even the burlap sack creatures were unable to live in harmony. The contradictions in this film probably stem from the fact that we humans really don't have the answer to saving the human race from ourselves. And any attempt to simplify it only ends in confusion and schism-centric behaviour. We appear to be a creature doomed to cycles of war and ""peace""... escalating our differences to violent bloodshed. Destined to repeat this kind of behaviour until we are all finally capable of peace within ourselves. 9 is a movie that wanted to offer us the answer... instead it shows us how naive we still are towards reaching that greater end. How can we achieve peace when we blame something outside of us for the inherent disharmony we create all on our very own? ""The fault dear Brutus is not in the stars (or machines with no souls) but in ourselves...""",9
164,lluewhyn,"Interesting, but should have been a video game, not a movie.",5,17 September 2009,"I pretty much agree with most of the posters- the movie is very visually interesting, but the poor story keeps you from getting immersed.What works? The movie is very beautifully drawn, and the action scenes are very creative and well-planned. In addition, the fact that the setting is actually somewhat different from our Earth(some weird fascistic government that isn't representative of any of the ones we've known so far) makes it a little refreshing and the allegory a little less heavy-handed.That's pretty much it.What doesn't work?1. The movie sets us up with an odd, post-apocalyptic world with a main protagonist who isn't human, but rather an artificial construct composed of burlap, metal and wood. As a result, I felt that the movie needed to explain both the setting and the nature of the characters to me. I suppose the setting is moderately explained, but the movie fails epically in terms of character development with the ""stitchpunks""(not a word actually used in the movie, IIRC).What do they know? What don't they know? What do we as the audience take for granted, but these characters have to discover? What are their motivations? Desires? Quirks? Basically, how are they similar to or different from humans, since they are not human? The movie just doesn't really explain this. They apparently know how to jury-rig devices like battery-operated lanterns and otherwise manipulate technology, but don't really discuss what they know about the world that was before. I think the only quirk that I remember is that the ""brute"" #8 used a magnet to pleasurably scramble his brain. To be honest, the movie could have swapped them out and just used human refugees from the war and very little except the end would have been different, as the stitchpunks don't really have any definable personality traits. 2. The main character doesn't appeal to the audience. Although most of the characters are one-dimensional, he's got like half a dimension. He is optimistic, and think that ""something should be done"". He's not terribly intelligent, has no real ideas, and gets some of the others killed for no reason at all, and just sucks as a character. And yet, everyone seems to follow his lead, and quickly accepts his pathetic apology after he gets one of their number killed for no reason.3. The whole plot line and setting would have been more appropriate as a video game than a movie, and came across as having as much fun as watching a video game that someone else is playing. Some of the elements included things like:a. A generic protagonist that everyone treats as special and germane to the moving of the plot, although the protagonist is otherwise not very special. b. Action scenes involving use of the scenery, and very similar to ""boss fights"" with horrific creatures that have no motivation other than destroying the main characters. c. Exploration through an unfamiliar and dangerous world, combined with a plot-reveal near the end where a main character gives a denouement about everything, including why the the characters are there and ""how to beat the final boss"". d. Dream-like logic(there seems to be no real reason why the stitchpunks were created other than to satisfy the movie), and a quick-fix ending of ""it's magic and everything is good again"" that makes absolutely no sense.",9
165,mechachan15,"""9"" - The world needs more animated movies like this!",7,20 September 2009,"At seeing the trailer for Shane Acker's new movie ""9"" on the internet..I was astounded. One of the most awesome trailers I'd ever seen. I knew instantly that I wanted to see the movie. About a week after it came out, I went to go see it. It wasn't quite what I was expecting. I'll break it down for you guys: Plot: 9 creations are made by a scientist when the world is almost at its end. The scientist dies, and the creations are all that remains on the earth..except for roaming mechanical monstrosities that serve a mysterious master.The plot was original. I don't care what anyone says. Yes, the post-apocalyptic theme has been done again and again, but never with little puppet-like protagonists. However, despite having a good concept, 9 has very quick pacing. So much so, that I was pretty surprised. There isn't very much build-up in the movie, mostly just hopping from scene to scene. Honestly though, this didn't bother or hinder the experience very much.The score: The music is quite good. Definitely inspired by Tim Burton, since he's one of the producers. The main theme is done by Danny Elfman, so of course it's good:) The animation: AMAZING! Visually, very appealing movie. In certain parts of the movie, the animation get's pretty darn close to Pixar quality.How does the movie make you feel?: 9 is a movie that tells of how people were too reliant on machines. It is also a movie about rebuilding. Like, what do you make out of a world that has nothing left in it? The theme definitely has a darker tone to it. Not really depressing, but just dark.Recommend: I seriously don't know what audience to recommend this movie to. Adults and teens are the target audience. But, please carefully research this movie if you have kids that scare easily and are planning to take them.Scare factor: There is a myriad of strange monsters in this movie. The main ones resemble a skeletal machine-like dog, a snake, and a flying bird with knives for a beak.When I lay it out like that..it doesn't sound very scary, but you need to seriously consider whether to show this movie to your kids or not. I actually don't think it would scare kids very much as long as they are at least 7 years old.This movie has dead bodies, character death, some creepy monsters, dark and dank scenery..just use discretion:).I've heard some people complaining about this movie. They say things like ""it's too short!"", ""the characters and story are boring!!"", ""it's confusing!"".Too short this movie is not. It's one hour, nineteen minutes. Average movie length is hour and a half.The characters are very simplistic and not much thought is given to developing their characters. However, you have to keep in mind that they are little burlap dolls. They have limited emotions. They don't act like people would because they aren't people.As far as ""boring"" goes, this movie just about had my eyes glued to the screen. It just depends on what kind of person you are, and what interests you.9 is a little on the confusing side..most notably at the end of the movie. It's one of those movies that is supposed to make you think, that is why not everything is spelled out.9 was originally a short film by Shane Acker when he was still in college. The original ""9"" was only about 10 minutes long. If this is considered, you can see why the plot appears to be rushed in the new version of the movie. That's how it originally was, after all.Overall: 9 is a movie with great computer graphics, good story, pleasant characters(almost refreshing with how simple they are), and some pretty cool action sequences. One of those particular scenes was practically genius. If your kid has a weird streak, they will probably enjoy this movie. Use discretion if your kids are really young or scare easily.9 gets a decent 7/10 rating from me. Thanks for reading, and please go see the movie! The world needs more kick butt animated movies like this!",9
166,roffma,Interesting Animated Film,7,10 December 2009,"I wasn't sure quite what to expect with this film but it was quite a good animated film. The animation is quite amazing mixing some rather low tech heroes with the high tech robots trying to destroy them. Also the surrounding scenery was quite well done.As for the story the plot was very simple but it was the interaction between the main characters that made it interesting as well as trying to figure out how some rag doll looking characters were going to take on advanced robots.It is a very original animated film and quite interesting, well worth spending a few dollars to see it at the cinemas.",9
167,edvin-6,"""Technology is bad, but buy this on Blu-Ray""",3,10 January 2010,"Call me demanding, but I have always believed movies should have well-contrived and meaningful plots, not just half-baked hints and guesses masquerading as one. And that's the main problem with 9. Sure, the visuals are impressive. Sure, the post-apocalyptic environment is depicted frightfully gloomy. Sure, the machines are very scary and stitchpunks' helplessness is really touching (at least during the first 15 minutes). But what is the meaning of all that? Why are the stitchpunks created? What is their purpose? What was the purpose of The Machine? How did it fail its creators? Why is 1 implying ""dark science"" and what exactly does he know about the past? Why the soul-sucking modus operandi? How did The Machine know what the stitchpunks are, if they were created after The Machine? So many questions which the script doesn't even try to answer, although the potential for an interesting story is obviously there. The only point this movie tries to shove in your face is the same, old ""technology is bad"" cliché - watch out for those lovely, tiny green creatures bathing in the raindrops, they will mend the world all right.",9

170,matt_in_da_net,Secretly a children's movie,4,5 June 2010,"They base the film's world on the ever-so original ""robot apocalypse"" cliché'. And as my friend mentioned to me, merges it with this Lord of the Rings-like 'quest' to save the world bullshit. It is all done in a PG-13 way, and never venture as dark or as intellectual as the many film's it originally re-uses.The Small puppet's trying to make a difference in a apocalyptic world much bigger than them. Reminds me of small hobbits trying to make a difference in a apocalyptic 'middle-earth' much bigger than them. Is it a coincidence that Ellijah Wood is voice acting 9? Probably not.The all seeing eye/spotlight was a lot like the one in lotr. A lot of the monsters seem like sentinel's from the matrix with the red camera eyes. The standing, tripod machine really looked like a cartoonified version of the machines in War of the Worlds.There was no intellectual discussion in the film, it's just 'gripping' *cough* action sequences designed to entertain a 12 year old. Everything is high implied and obvious, which attributes itself to a children's film.I was expecting something more, but then it abruptly ended at probably an 1 1/2 hour film. I treated it like a talented animation student's technical exercise. A student which doesn't have any particular intention to show anything new or original in terms of story, but simply showcase his animation art.",9
171,erv-7,"Good visuals, but weak story",5,19 November 2009,"I watched it, and I can't say I fully enjoyed it. Can't say I want my time back, but I certainly could spend my time better.This movie has nice visuals, but seriously lacks depth. Characters are extremely weak and some of them have no personality. Their acting is full of clichés (multiple gasps at certain moments, ""don't go there"", ""we must help"", etc), there is no character development. At many times I had a feeling that characters act illogically/unrealistically. Movie tries to be dramatic, but fails. The ending doesn't feel right (although it can be called a happy ending), and could be different, possibly better, more fantastic. I can think about at least one way it could be more entertaining. Overall, when characters don't talk to each other, the movie is good. When they start talking it is really bad, and hard to watch without cringe, because dialogs are mediocre, and acting (both voice and non-voice) could use improvement.I must admit, that despite what one of other posters said, movie does explain what happened. The details are just scattered a bit across the movie.Anyway, if you want only good visuals, this is a movie for you, and kids might enjoy it (not sure if it is fully suitable for small kids). If you want solid work with good script and acting, then ""Corpse Bride"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Ratatoille"", ""Toy Story"", ""Resident Evil: Degeneration"" (even though it is not a kids' movie), ""Wall-E"", ""Coralaine"" or Pixar's animated short called ""Presto"" will be much better choice - they are all superior to this movie in terms of acting and story quality. And for true depth there is ""Ghost in the Shell""/""Ghost in the shell 2"".",9
172,bigskalko,pieces,7,2 August 2010,"As much as movies seem to drag on pushing over the 2 hour mark when at least a half hour + could have been deleted, this one needed more than what was put into it. This story was barely pushed over the 75 min mark and an extra fifteen minutes would have counted tremendously.9 wakes up and you're immediately into the action. He seems to go with the flow and has a purpose without even questioning who he is or what he is. More character development would have been much better to end up gathering feelings for this creatures instead of just throwing them into the mix.There aren't any twists or turns as the characters quickly catch on to killing their ""bad ass"" foes. This is why the story ends up progressing so rapidly.The film did have a lot of promise and did what it could within its short time span.

173,kate-stuart,Darkness,9,9 April 2018,"""9 is not a casual film. This isn't the kind of movie where you invite a bunch of friends over, expecting an """"awesome"""" movie. That's not to say it's a bad movie, it's quite good in fact. It's just not a typical film. It's bleak, it's eerie, and even the action, though strong, has a lot of symbolic meaning. I don't often watch films like 9, nor do I want to. 9 offers only a few smiles, and no laughs. Rule #1 for me, it has to have humor. I don't mind serious films, but a little humor can go a long way in helping me remember the film, and enjoy it. 9 manages to entertain without laughs. But 9 has a lot of emotion anyway. Fear certainly comes to mind, as does sadness. The PG-13 rating was not earned from language or sexual content. Part of it comes from the bloodless, yet intense violence. The more protruding part comes from the darkness. Despite it's limited inappropriate content, this is not a film for kids. It's dark themes may even challenge older ones. The story isn't all that sophisticated, to be honest. And there's more than a few cliches. There are plot points we've seen before, and characters that may evoke a sense of deja vu. But that's okay, because the movie is strong. The animation is incredible. The musical score, though a little run of the mill, is appropriately creepy, and it knows when to keep quiet. The voice cast is filled with stars that shine, but don't distract. Of course, you didn't come to see any of that. Depending on who you are, you came for one of two things; an intellectual film, and thought provoking themes, or epic machine vs. rag doll fights. If action is what you came for, you shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of, I shouldn't say duels, but fights between the stitch dolls, and the mechanical beasts. This film is not made up of action throughout, so teens coming ONLY for the action will surely be disappointed, but there's enough action to thrill and excite. If you came for intellectual stimulation, you will have to wait for after the film to enjoy that bit. During the movie, you will have to do little thinking. This is the kind of flick that inspires conversation after viewing. As the film runs, you simply have to sit back and enjoy. 9 is a wonderful movie. It's by no means, one for the ages, but it's a thought-provoking, heart pounding little flick, that can surely be enjoyed by any one who wants to try something, a little new.""",9
174,eraser_head2001,Poor story and character development.,1,19 July 2011,"The only real reason people like this movie so much is that Tim Burton slapped his name on it at last-minute as a ""get rich quick"" scheme and it seemed to work because otherwise, the film itself would have flopped.Now, with that out of the way, let's dive into this poor excuse of animation.First and foremost, the only thing that was remotely ""well-done"" was the animation and visual. It was promising and gave the film a different look and feel to it. Too bad the plot was garbage. The story, while interesting to a point, failed to get my attention and keep me eager to continue watching the rest of the film. You're dropped into the story with no explanation until the near end which frustrated me to no end, making me feel like I've wasted precious time. Along with bad plot, comes bad characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were interesting but the film hardly gives us a chance to actually KNOW them. Like Number 6, he was just thrown in only to show that there were more of those ragdolls. He was hardly involved with the plot until the very end. Otherwise, he just drew pictures and ""oohed and awwed"" at them. Overall, this was a blatant Tim Burton wannabe film that failed to accomplish in plot, character development, and as a film. My advice: save your time and money and watch something else.",9
175,caesarjd,Quality Animation With Moral Depth,9,18 January 2010,"We do a weekly movie night in our house (Daughter 8, Son 10). I often find it difficult to find a gender neutral movie that both kids will enjoy that Mom and I can stand to sit through. I didn't even read the reviews of 9 before downloading it, so I went into the movie with a clean slate. I was pleasantly surprised by a movie that included no foul language, no sexual innuendo, and real depth.It should be noted here that there are some scenes that are really intense, but my daughter managed to sit through them, although she did squirm a bit. I would also add that there is a scene where the character 8 uses a magnet to get a buzz. Neither point detracted from the family friendliness of this film in my opinion.Most animated movies are so shallow that they're painful for me as a pseudo adult to watch. This movie had real depth however, that actually prompted a family discussion after the movie, you parents out there know how rare those are. The whole movie revolves around human character traits and how they influence our actions, and how they can be perverted to corrupt our social construct. There is a lot of ambiguity in 9, some of the characters aren't as well developed as our more mature viewers might have liked, and there are plot shortfalls that a longer movie might have addressed. All the ambiguity heightened the movie for me though because it prompted some of the thought that went into our family dialog as the credits rolled. Frankly I'm looking for the book to satisfy my own interest in the plot development. A great family movie - well worth taking a chance on.",9

The characters were so diverse, from the clothes they wear to their personalities, to their relationships with each other. They pulled at my heartstrings and pushed me towards my box of Kleenex.

But 9 quickly discovers there are more like him, but what he doesn't know is that they are all in serious danger. Machines try to attack them, including one in the first scene, The Beast. Made with a cat's skull, and other weird parts. Then here comes The Winged Beast. Then 9 unknowingly kills 2, the first person he meets. But also awakens The Fabrication Machine, also called B.R.A.I.N., the most dangerous robot. The Machine, short for The Fabrication Machine, creates The Winged Beast. Which has four eyes, a rib cage, wings and sharp objects for most of it's head. But the other characters kill it, and The Machine creates The Seamstress, a snake-like robot.

But the celebration is over when 5 finds out that the machine isn't dead, and The Machine kills 5. They escape to a bridge, and The Machine gets trapped in a broken half of the bridge, and 7 tries to kill it, but 6 says that the souls of the other dead characters are trapped inside of the machine, and not to kill it because they can still save the souls. 9 believes 6, But suddenly one of the machines hands comes and grabs 6, and kills him. 1,3,4,7 and 9 are the only ones left.

179,spieck1,"Beautiful, but lifeless sampled story",6,16 August 2010,"I watched this film knowing almost nothing about it (got the DVD from a colleague). For the first minutes I was stunned by 9. The visual style is unique. Just with dark colors brown, gray, black 9 creates a postwar world where simple dolls and machine monsters are the only inhabitants. This is not your usual kid-oriented animation movie with some cultural references to keep the adults attention. This is darker stuff for adults with just enough cuteness to not lose all kids. I immediately loved it.But 25 minutes into the film I find myself constantly checking the watch. And this did not stop until 9 ended, which is actually after 70 minutes. They must have added 9 minutes of credits to reach the IMDb-running time. So what went wrong? The problem with 9 is that it feels like fabulous short that someone liked so much he decided to turn it into feature length. But if you do this you need some plot and character development. The visuals will only carry for 10 minutes. What 9 delivers in form of plot and characters is sadly not original at all. In every scene you get the ""I know that"", ""I've seen that before"" feeling. Instead of writing a script that's as original as the visuals 9 just samples elements from other stories and movies.In the end I am much more disappointed than I would be if 9 was just another bad movie. It started so great and seemed to have so much potential that I feel let down by the film makers lack of care in the story department. In the film there is a device that can ""breath"" life into dolls and machines. I wish they had it while making the movie.",9
180,d-kampen,"9, probably written by a 9 year old.",6,28 July 2016,"9 was overall a very entertaining movie, sadly though it wasn't that good.The main thing that held this movie down was it's story, it's about a rag doll called 9 who awakens in a house and goes to explores a mostly live-less post-apocalyptic world. But don't led has name fool you because he's the one, and he's is destined to save the world. In his journey he meets some other rag dolls, he meets a big terrifying monster and he discovers what happened to the world. Just like 9 being the one the story about the apocalypse is also very cliché: humans make robots and robots go rogue and kill the humans.Another big thing that irritated me about this movie was it's pacing, the first and last part of this movie was were in my opinion a bit to short and could've been fleshed out some more.The characters in this movie were also a bit cliché(to name a few: the one, the love-interest, the muscle, the best friend) but they were enjoyable to watch and all served their purpose.This film also doesn't really know who it's target audience is, it's probably to scary for children but it's to simplistic for adults.Overall I would give this movie a 6,3 because of it was very cliché, had some pacing issues but the characters and setting were interesting enough to keep me entertained.",9

And only a handful of...what... sack people? robots? What were they?? And so they contain the soul of the scientist. So what? and so what now? There are STILL no humans.... and why is the soul of ONE person going to make any difference? Once the sack robots break down, or die off, or whatever it is they do, then what?

183,Harlemer,An interesting premise and look....,7,12 April 2010,"9 is one of those movies that could be fantastic, but is often bogged down by several very prominent flaws. For every good thing there is about this film, there's something bad. The atmosphere is great, but the characters are dull. The setting is fitting and exciting, but the story is a bit lacking.Let's start off with what makes 9 ""bad"". If you're looking for a movie with an incredibly complex, mind-blowing story, then this film probably isn't for you. It's your typical, average 'machines-take-over-the-world' scenario played out through the eyes of rag dolls. It's main character, 9, is a late-awakening rag doll who is introduced to the other rag dolls throughout the movie, all with their own numbers and distinct personalities. They're all that's left of humanity's ""personality"" and are living in a desolate world destroyed from the machine-human war. Like I said, a simple story with a few twists and turns that will keep kids more enthralled than adults. But that's not to say the story isn't interesting and somewhat engaging. You certainly won't get bored of it, because the movie isn't too long.Secondly, the characters are a bit of a let down. There isn't much character development, except for maybe 5, who is by far the most three dimensional character of the bunch. 9 is your typical hero, he starts off as an out-of-water fish, because he 'awakens' later than the rest, and gradually becomes the strong leader the other characters need. You could call this character development, but it isn't anything we haven't seen before. The rest of the cast are a collection of personalities with little depth. You've got the ""warrior girl"", the ""cynical leader"", the ""dumb brute"", the ""shy and tentative friend"", the ""wise inventor"", and the ""psychic oddball."" They even have ""curious and child-like twins"" that serve to give a bit of exposition. The good thing about this is that the writers didn't go overboard. For instance, the only female character is portrayed as an independent, strong, and protective individual, but unlike other movies, she doesn't wave the feminist card in your face, or act like a raging whore for the entire movie. I rather liked how mellow and level headed she acted, whilst simultaneously being awesome.Now, what makes this movie really good? Well, first of all, it's a child's film in my opinion. I don't see why some people think kids can't handle character death or scary images, because it's not true. This movie doesn't shy away from any of those themes often left behind in kid films, in fact they may have gone a little too far, but a lot of the death scenes were rather touching. That being said, kids will probably go crazy for this movie. The character's and story seem perfect for them, because they're much more simplified and clear for a younger viewer than for an older one.Second of all, the movie has perfect atmosphere. I feel that for the lack of character development, the tone and mood of the movie couldn't be better. It was quite depressing in some moments, while surprisingly frightening in others. And mixed with the impressive visual effects, it created a very intense setting that was a pleasing combination of several ""punk"" genres. While at some times I felt the movie had a very ""cyberpunk"" feel to it, I would also see elements of ""steampunk"" and even ""biopunk."" Above all, of course, were the main characters making it perfectly clear that it was heading down the ""stitchpunk"" route.All in all, I think it's a movie worth seeing, but I wouldn't say jump over your grandmother's dead body to do so.",9

Since this is from the point of view of little dolls, you get to see everything in the world magnified 10x... like the individual threads that make up the doll's bodies, the little cracks in the pavement, etc. As for sound effects, everything that could make a sound, made a sound, and was done in detail... whether it's the rustling of leaves in the background or the small footsteps of the each doll as they scampered about. The story was good, but sadly seemed too short, and was paced a bit too quickly. I felt like I was just stepping into this interesting, curious world, and all of a sudden I'm thrown out of it. Events follow each other very fast and doesn't leave much time to let everything sink in before you're off to the next event. Anyways, I liked this movie; the concepts and ideas in the story were quite unique and piqued the imagination.",9
186,sparklemagic,Has plot but no STORY!,5,4 September 2009,"Well, i saw this movie last night at a screening. Not knowing anything  about this movie, I was completely blind going in and found it easy to  get lost. The movie moves -QUICK- from one plot point to the next.  Normally these kids movies have lots of connecting scenes and dialogue  between the characters that this movie just did not have. It was like  one major plot point to the next and felt very rushed.  That said, I think this was because of the awesome visual effects and  rendering that they had to do. They simply couldn't waste time  rendering non essential scenes. I would have given the movie another  half year of development, to make it a more rounded piece. That said, I  have never seen as good computer graphics in a movie before. They are  truly state of the art. Its the only reason this movie is getting a 5  out of 10 instead of a 1 or a 2. Too bad there was no character  development. They had a lot of opportunities to make you feel for the  characters, but they were never explored. It felt like the whole movie  was a time crunch - like rushing through rides at a theme park because  your dad wants to beat the traffic on the way home.  It was a hollow adventure movie. Definitely not living up to the normal  character development that Tim Burton can create. I guess everyone can  have a flop once and a while. It should be  viewed in higher than DVD quality, but I wouldn't pay theater prices  for the thing.",9

There is something unique about each of us but it cannot be expressed until the moment that we find in ourselves who we are truly. In this movie's desolate setting, it makes ask ourselves, because of it's seemingly benign and unassuming manner, a question to the child inside.it connects and asks whether this is or this is not a world for the purpose of selfish fulfillment and either way what this might bring.I feel this movie speaks about another level of being and warns against creating with today's vast powers (surprisingly pertinent) for the purpose of satisfying ego versus creating something within ourselves that can have a lasting value in the way it connects us to each other.I thoroughly enjoyed the quality of this picture and it's message.And i hope that each and every one of you will find the time experience it in your own manner, cheers.",9

189,Animation Wizard,9 might have been the film of the year... but its a blockbuster shelf duster now.,2,12 September 2009,"9, the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment.I was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character. The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices??How, what, when, why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd. Which... is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect.9 could have been awesome... with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators.",9

Been stitch punks, it's amazing to see how well the animation has been directed. For ex: the emotions of each stitch punk. i was wonder to see how much i have touched with the ""9""'s emotions though it's just a simple CGI face. And this is a good post- apocalyptic film too.Well directed animations, good story line.

191,littlelovephobia,Sometimes pacing is the appropriate response.,7,25 October 2009,"OK, here we have it, ""9"" one of my most anticipated movies of 2009. And unfortunately, one of the most disappointing movies of the year, at least for me. While ""9"" is by no means a completely bad movie, it has too many flaws, so let's cut the cake.Nine starts in this post-apocalyptic world a la Terminator where the machines have taken over the world and a scientist have created rag dolls which destiny seems to save humanity. An our little friend, the rag doll number nine has awaken in this empty room, trying to figure out what's happening, encountering another rag doll like him, named number two.While the beginning and the concept of this movie seems pretty interesting, like mixing Toy Story with Terminator Salvation, Shane Acker after a good beginning rush things up. The pacing of the movie is ugly, never allowing the characters to develop. At the very beginning you see a Nine that has a lot of fear, then on the very next scene he's now the fearless rag doll among his peers. And we have tons of this, characters having a complete different personality or doing things that betray their motives. A completely lack of direction, if only Shane Acker has taken more time for his characters to develop, the film will be a whole lot better.But it's not only the characters but the story too the one that seems rushed, story goes from point A to point B very randomly. Once your at point A and when point A feels like it will come to its climax which never truly reaches you get to point B and a different sequence has begun. This perhaps be more an editing problem, but the real problem I have with the movie was the screenplay. I mean, you have a win win situation where you can create both an action epic animated movie and a classic sci-fi fairy tale but you never get any of it. Instead, you get a very cliché storyline, unsatisfying conclusions and a feel that something's missing, there's no deep, no emotion.But OK, let's focus on the good things that ""9"" has. The animation is top notch, not as intense as the Oscar nominated short which was the basis for the film, but it really created a Gothic atmosphere and the rag dolls look truly amazing. Number 5, number 6 and number 2 rag dolls have some good moments and are the best characters. The Harry Potter (fans from Harry will know what I'm talking about) style conclusion was pretty good too.Basically, ""Nine"" is the short film in a new 79 minute version. Though not recommended for the kids to some parents I think kids who like some action, good animation and sci-fi will enjoy the movie and feel attracted to it.Recommended for those who enjoyed Bruce Willi's ""Surrogates"", ""Titan A.E."" and those othe good and entertaining sci-fi movies.Yes, it had such potential, such promise, but then, ""Nine"" you lacked cohesion.",9

Got my first glimpse of the movie and the characters were just a turnoff, they were bland, none stood out, it was just meh. The premise of the movie feels so light and had me fall asleep in front of it while it depicts its little science-fiction plot hole presentation. The best compliments for this one are its animation which was pretty nice. Other than that, it did nothing for me whatsoever, and I'd highly recommend people save their $9.50 or whatever the price for cinema admission. Don't waste your money.

Usually I am mad to waste my time on a plot-less movies, but this time I am truly sad. I am really sad the creators did not work more (or at all) on the plot and script. That really killed it for the movie.There is nothing more to say. Perfect animation (for the environment), perfect characters build up, perfect scenery, perfect time, perfect idea, but all the perfects were degraded to average by the absence of a mindful storyline :-( I honestly do believe that the audience is not even close that stupid, yet being served things like this plot.

197,jawbreaker18,Imagination at it's finest!,10,9 September 2009,"I come from the school of early Tim Burton, and Jim Henson- two of my cinema deities from my earliest memories- and this is the first time in a long time that anyone has managed to touch on that magic for me. I'll do my best to convey what a fantastic movie this is, without really revealing too much of the plot- because I think that this movie is best experienced not really knowing anything. You come in the same way the main character does- not knowing anything of this world. While sitting in the theater, I recalled memories of the intensity and heart of ""my first movies"" such as E.T., The Secret of Nymh, The Dark Crystal, and Edward Scissorhands- movies that touched upon something that was at once so rooted in human emotion yet so fantastic and unimaginable. I can absolutely say that ""9"" is now considered one in that catalog of visionary and hallowed movies. Guaranteed some will have a complaint with the length (a seemingly short 79 minutes considering the scale and impact of the story) but I think that a movie can be an epic without needing to be over 2 hours long, or a HUGE amount of unnecessary back story and origins that's only purpose is to make the story SEEM grandiose. This movie is a complete work of art- from the obviously eye-catching visual style and composition of what you see, down to the basic story and character development that you feel. In 79 minutes this team managed to harness my imagination and senses without having to dumb-it-down for the audience, or use any of the old gags that many bigger studios seem to rely on to sell tickets (thankfully there are NO cheesy gross out jokes to appeal to a typical cable-fed attention span). Instead they took me to places that I had never thought of, but will never forget. My most respectful nod to everyone involved. Absolutely do not miss this one.",9

They recommended this to me and to be honest I didn't expect much seeing as it was only over an hour long.But I was surprised.The movie has a bit of a dark nature. It gives it a mysterious feel as you follow 9(elijah Wood) as he wakes up. I thought that his character wasn't fully projected and they could have improved his personality a bit. I did like the idea's behind the other characters and the main villain. The plot as well as the characters is fairly unique in animation and action. I also thought the animation was exceptionalHowever, I wish it was a bit longer and sometimes the story runs dry. There were some attempts of humour but they were hit and miss. Overall, it was pretty enjoyable and unique to watch. But its not Amazing.",9
200,hauntedmemories17,A Beautiful Masterpiece for People Willing to Pay Attention and Think,9,19 September 2009,"I first saw the short this movie was based on a year ago and thought, this is a truly moving and unique story. When I heard it would become a full-length feature, I was thrilled. Finally, I was able to see it and can honestly say the movie did not disappoint.The animation in this movie is amazing. It's something you don't see too often with CGI and often I got lost in the visuals. The team of creators took the original short's plot, visuals, and concepts, and expanded them into a story that more people could appreciate.The story and characters were unique in their own ways. The plot was one that makes you think and question what life would be like if there were no humans left. Imagine a scientist trying to solve his mistakes by creating a fragment of humanity to survive even if human beings could not. Take that story, and see it play out as he tries to save humanity yet again, this time as 9 fragmented personalities. And that, in itself, is what makes the story unique. The characters themselves are not terribly deep, but this makes sense because they are fragments that, to maintain what little humanity is left, have to band together.The key to this movie is that you have to pay attention and you have to go into the theater ready to think. Watch the short first. If it appeals to you, go see the movie. I won't say the movie is for everyone because not everyone likes to think or pay attention to what is really being said and done, but if you are that type you will appreciate it. That having been said, this is not a movie for young children. Just because it is CGI does not mean it's a child's story. It's a post apocalyptic world. And no, there are no cute fuzzies to be felt in this film. Just the utter despair of 9 beings trying to survive the best as they can in a world run by machines trying to vanquish humanity.The only downside to this movie, in my opinion, was the dialog. The movie could have held itself without words like the original short. But then, I guess even more people would be complaining and not willing to see it.",9
201,Soom,"Terrible disappointment, almost left the cinema in the middle",2,26 September 2009,"I'm not sure what dragged me into the cinema to watch this movie, but few minutes after it started, I wanted to leave the theater. For a while I hoped at least the story will surprise me, but then realized it's a waste of time, there was just nothing there. I stayed only because I had another show after it.Design: some designs where quite beautiful, mostly of the environment, but the characters were terrible both in terms of animation and design. They look great while still - on posters and screenshots, but not when they have to come to life! They just didn't work, mostly because the very same mistake most 3D companies make: technically it is very hard to create really natural materials in 3D, that would make you feel that the character is alive. You need a lot of effort and knowledge (hence money) to create something that really feels like hair, skin, fabric, etc. Those characters in the movie were made out of ""cloth"", and that just didn't work! So they had this ugly cold feeling of the computer artificiality, where the cloth stretches or squeezes like a piece of plastic. It just didn't have the feel of a material, that dolls are made of (that's what those characters meant to be). I think it was a big mistake choosing this style for the characters. It just had a feeling of a 3D shoot'n'run computer game. I don't want to go to cinema to have a computer game on my screen, don't know about you...Animation was also a disgrace. I am a professional animator and was terribly disappointed at the low level of animation in ""9"". It was stiff, boring, almost lacked any imagination or mood. It was just a little bit above most average 3D animations I saw, and that doesn't add to it any good...And all that - the bad character design and bad animation could be solved with a good story, right?! That was not the case here. Actually the story was the worst thing in that movie. It was below any level. It starts straight forward, it goes straight forward and it ends the same. There is no twist, no surprise, no good dialogs, even no development. We've heard and saw stories of machines overtaking the humankind thousands of times and ""9"" is just one of them, and we know how it ends at the very first minute of that movie. The characters don't even have time to get into the story - they are just there, showing themselves almost immediately, and immediately some of them take action without even getting to know what's going on. It just didn't work. There are also many repetitive action sequences, that looked as if they were made to fill in the time for the lack of a story...Acting, sound and script - oh my gosh, what can I tell, it was pathetic. Bad story has a bad script, and except dialogs like ""No, don't do it!"" ""I will do it!"" ""But... you cannot do it alone!"" ""We can do it together!"" ""But there are rules!"" ""But we have to save him!"" etc etc and so on, and repeating itself all the time, so besides those terribly pathetic dialogs, there were those non stop ""Ahh"" and ""Ohhh"" and""Ehh"", and ""Oooh"", and ""Whatchout"", and ""Run!"" and ""OhOhh!"" that were following almost every jump, run, or fall of the characters and it even sounded as if they were out of sync or even unrehearsed.Conclusion: bad acting, bad animation, bad sound, bad story, bad script, bad characters, everything expected, no surprises, no twist, nothing. Only some good designs are not worth the time. BIG NO!",9
202,cellsbellsian,Great looking movie with an amazing ending,8,28 April 2018,"This movie is pretty brilliant. While it is not perfect, and certainly doesn't succeed on every level, it's an awesome movie I've watched over and over again. The animation in it is gorgeous for 2009 standards and all the characters are solid and fleshed out, and you actually end up liking each of them. The tone of the movie is really well done, with every setting looking hopeless and desolate, with gray and brown colors to accentuate the wasteland. Hell, to me, even the villain, a cold, dead robot, is likeable. The ending, while not a twist, really gets you. It's not a perfect ending, but it works beautifully for a movie like this, and is rather bleak for a children's movie.
The story of this movie is really fleshed out, with everything being revealed to you at a perfect pace. The animation style goes alongside it really well, with a mixing of cartoonish looks and gritty atmosphere for a perfect blend.
If you're in need of a good movie to watch, you might want to choose this one.",9
203,Victor van Doorn,This is not a feature..,4,20 September 2009,"..but a short film put on loop. And not a great one at that.(start spoiler) 9's plot is thoroughly uninteresting, even though its premise is -the premise being nine rag-dolls exploring a post-apocalyptic landscape and finding out they're the last of what remains of 'humanity', kept safe in their non-human form. (end spoiler)As a fantasy story, this one feels unoriginal because, we've seen the bearer of an evil magic artifact enter a dark volcanic valley flanked by his faithful friend (for f*ck's sake; they cast Elijah Wood in the exact same part).. The concecpt of splitting and storing a human soul into objects has been much more powerfully explored in the Harry Potter books and the post-apocalyptic setting as consequence of a struggle between humans and artificially intelligent machines was not just introduced but epitomized in The Matrix. Don't steal ingredients if you can't make a better cake (i don't believe this is actually a saying, so you heard it here first..)The characters keep repeating their clichéd lines in different variations and the tension arcs are also very repetitive.. 1.) group goes into new territory, 2.) monster appears and nearly takes one of group 3.) lone ranger from group returns and defeats monster.. 4.) intermission with feeble new plot information, then repeat)As a lesson in how chewed-up-and-spit-out storytelling works, this is a valuable one.

204,tomaz-povsin,"9 has much potential, but ends up being a ""meh""",5,7 March 2010,"I have registered an account here just to share the opinion of many other reviewers here, which could be generally boiled down to this (warning, spoilers ahead):1. The visuals are stunning - they are a tribute to cutting-edge technology in Hollywood's animation studios. Sadly, this reminds me much of the actual movie plot: there is way too much focus on CGI and way too little to the characters and plot which should be at the center of every good movie.2. The characters have also much potential - but they don't take it anywhere; for instance - the potential for a romantic relationship between 9 and 7, or the aspect of 1's religious fear of the unknown, etc... but it all remains at the implications, the characters don't evolve, which could be partly explained by them being each a part of the human soul (very nice touch), but then the plot messes up everything, which brings me to3. The ""plot"" which has the biggest potential but turns out the worst disappointment. The viewer starts with a complete blank, and then through the first half of the movie pieces together some parts which make much sense, when later on 9 returns to ""the source"" and sees his makers hologram; so far so good. Me and a lot of others with whom I have talked about this, all agree: The machine was ""friendly"" while it had the scientist, e.g. his soul around, then when the evil army men used it for their evil ways, it became also evil. So how would the scientist correct the evil army men's error and make the machine ""good"" again? Simple: by re-inserting his soul in to the machine, which would be accomplished by him giving parts of his soul to artificial homunculi, which would then all take their individual soul-parts to the machine, where the scientists soul would be re-united and would then use it's mechanical body to rebuild the world, YAY! At least that would be the sensible way to do it... But sadly it looks as if some religious Hollywood nut has cut the obvious ending and inserted a spiritual substitute which not only makes no sense but also ruins the otherwise big potential of 9. The machine gets destroyed, and the ""freed"" soul-parts ascent to heaven, then rain starts to fall with new life inside.... meh. How can the remaining sack-puppets hope to save the earth, if they are missing vital parts of the soul? How can the life which has fallen with the rain save the earth, if it is - again - missing vital parts of the whole? It sadly makes no sense.As I said earlier: 9 has had much potential but ended up a ""meh"" for me and many others; truly a pity.",9
205,timchilds7,What!?!?!,4,10 September 2009,"What?!?? Why are people saying this is ""mind blowing?"" Just face it the ending is on of the worst endings in the history of cinematography! 4 left and the whole world has ended! Not to mention the character 9 was a idiot the whole time he got everyone killed. 1 was right the whole time, if he sacrificed 9 then non of this would have happened. People giving there lives for a stupid cause and for what?... to make it rain? I admit the movie had it's parts, and the whole concept was fascinating. But a lot of it was clichés one after another. And did anybody else get this feeling that this is a lot like ""Lord of The Rings?"" Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guys left in the world; its pointless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank god! How is robots turning against humans creative in any way! It's been done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go see a movie that's worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover, or Inglorious Basterds, those were good movies!",9
206,TimeLordMechanic,Too short,5,14 December 2009,"This movie had potential but in the end it fails to deliver. It certainly looks good, and they did a great job of creating a post-apocalyptic looking world. I also liked the idea that each of the different characters represented a different part of the human soul(leadership, memory, curiosity) and therefor had different roles. The idea for the story was interesting but overall the movie is too short. I certainly would have liked to see more character interaction in between all the action scenes. Take the movie WALL-E for example, despite the fact that the little guy almost never talks, there is enough time spent in the beginning of the movie where we get a sense of his personality and the world he lives in.Overall, this film focused to much on the action and visuals than on plot and character development. And as for the ending, well, I felt that it came too quickly and without enough explanation of what was going on.",9
207,EternalFlameOfFreedom,Little piece of art,9,3 April 2010,"Before I watch this title my expectations was mixed due to little above average rating and of course different reviews so I didn't know what to expect from it.From the beginning I had sensation that this is going to be something good since animations and the atmosphere has that sparkle that lights your imagination and sensations. As the story goes on I was amazed how this entire world with all the characters in it fits just perfect and animations that brings us this story is so natural without exaggerate scenes or effects. The idea with this animated film was bullseye and the animation team did excellent job, highly respect for making this film as it is.Writer and director of this film is unknown for me but if he continues like this in future, outcome will be another well known name in cinematography. Production line up was absolutely great since it involves two genius with brilliant imagination. Names Timur Bekmambetov and Tim Burton says more than needed about how was this film done and created. Oh yes, Danny Elfman is in music department so you know what can be expected from him.One brief notice about review and comments that this is kids film are completely wrong since this title has to offer much more that plain comments like that.OVERALL: This film has great storyline, developed characters, wonderful animation and refreshing idea. By all means go and watch this film, you will not regret it.p.s. People with low imagination and lack of mankind emotions should not bother to see this since they would probably miss everything that is good about this film.",9
208,tnt80808,"A true great, if it had just chosen an audience!",7,18 July 2010,"First things first. DO NOT SHOW THIS MOVIE TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN!! This is a very dark and often scary animation. I would recommend it as an 8 years and up movie, minimum!And this is also this movies biggest problem. It just didn't pick a target market. It is neither cuddly enough for kids or smart enough for adults. Many reviewers have said how they were confused by the plot or that there didn't seem to be a reason for anything??? I found the opposite, this movie is very straight-forward, a little too so maybe. It is a simple tale of good versus evil in a post apocalyptic, alternative earth. (I fear the suits holding the money may have had something to do with the ""dumbing down"" of the story however and not the writers).All this being said, it is beautiful to look at, with some fantastic set pieces and atmosphere and despite it's simple story, it is a sweet tale. The voice acting is solid (special mention goes to John C Riley for his ever-so-sweet portrayal of ""5"") and the action scenes are tense and well thought out. As I said earlier, the monsters in this really are quite creepy, even by grown-up standards, add to that the post-war setting and occasional images of (albeit CG) dead bodies/death and this really puts this movie out of the young kids film bracket.""9"" could have been so much more. In my opinion, it would have worked better as a grown-up animation with a slightly meatier script and the peril ramped up a little. As it is, it sits somewhat uncomfortably in limbo between kids and grown-ups, fully satisfying neither. Now, your thinking, ""he gave this 7/10 and all he has done is complain!"" well, it is a good movie and I did enjoy it a lot. It is haunting, thought provoking and beautifully animated and would have scored a 10/10 if it had just been written more towards older viewers.A fantastic idea, lovingly animated. could have been a classic if it had just been a little braver in the writing phase.",9

If you want to watch a quick film which will entertain you then this is the one. I just wanted to know more... about the doll's ideas of theology, why they where created, what powers them, why the monster robot needed their souls, why they were created differently (big, Small, Mute, etc) but, alas this was not in the film. I agree with a previous poster; it needed to be 10-20 more minutes longer and have an ending which was more to do with the story. I was honestly expecting that the ending would go like this... The dolls have parts of the Scientist's soul in each of them (parts which the bad robot was missing right?) so I imagined a finale where all the dolls would be absorbed by the bad robot, making it complete and what the Scientist had intended it to be. It would then re-cultivate the Earth or something (like a prequel to Wall-e :-). 9 would be the last to go but realize that he needed to sacrifice himself and join his 8 companions for the betterment of the planet.",9
210,free-saxon,Plenty of talent . But wasted opportunity,3,13 March 2011,"Visually pleasing, with a very novel and rustic look and 'feel' . Crisp imaginative animation Voice characterisations by actors stays on track with believable performances. As many reviewers have stated, 9 is full of clichés and lacks a strong storyline, ultimately you feel let down, as the clichés and weak plot play out. There it is !! up on the screen . yawn . yet again !! Swastika like, triangular flags, Dictators stiff arm saluting, Nazi'sque soldiers subliminally, fleetingly, flash by. Strong female types, indirect denigration of Christianity.. all been done before ... yawn Just for once it would be nice to see an evil communist dictatorship responsible for wrong doing ( after all in the real world up to 56 million died under the Bolshevik communists )",9
211,sketchball90,"Once again, form over function",5,4 October 2009,"I might have had my expectations too high when I walked into the theater. I hadn't done any reading and was under the impression that Tim Burton had directed it. So when it became obvious 5 minutes into the movie that once again I was going to be subjected to big budget stylistic environments and effects sans any kind of real mental engagement, I was pretty disappointed.There were so many problems with this movie I don't really know where to begin without rambling. So instead I'll just say that the ""good"" is all about the visuals. The ""bad"" is all about my issues with plot and character development, audience education, cheesy dialog and unambiguous morality in circumstances that should force compromise at every turn. Being any more specific would result in a hideously long post, so here are my top 3 gripes: The story advances too quickly early on for the sake of setting up the second half of the movie. It left me with an empty feeling akin to throwing away dinner so you can have dessert.At the core of our protagonists identities is the idea of a multifaceted human soul (i.e. aspects of our personalities captured in discrete pieces of our immortal selves). Unfortunately, almost no time is devoted to explaining or developing this concept. It's up to the viewer to decide if they care or not and why. Beyond the heavy handed symbolism of the church Stitchpunks vs the university Stitchpunks, there isn't much of a reason you have to. The idea felt like a convenient foil device instead of the meaningful linchpin it could have been.The ""successful"" outcome of the movie is dependent on a wildly lucky string of events. There's no solid story here about bravery in the face of adversity, intelligent heroes, clever plot twists, and a few narrow escapes. Instead you get a chain of formulaic action scenes in which any of a few hundred close calls gone wrong prevents our happy ending. Give me an engaging story, not an account of winning the lottery 5 times in a row. See Secret of Nimh for a reasonably good animated noir counterexample.Ultimately, I could probably sum up the mass of problems with ""target audience confusion"". On the surface, it seems aimed at a more mature set of folks (13 years +?) with its graphic wartime theme and truly creepy villains. The development of everything else and the simplistic dialog feels targeted at a younger audience. It probably could have worked well as either. Tone it down, keep it short and sweet for the 9 year old set or lengthen it and spend more time on story, characters, etc for the older crowd. It fails in targeting both.",9

I had not seen any trailers, read any info about it or even heard of it.9, i thought. Well it's animated and i'm not really a fan of that category.. whatever. Let's just see what it is. From the first opening scene to the last of the end credits i could not take my eyes of the screen.This movie had absolutely everything. Visuals, story, music, atmosphere and above all, an unimaginable epic way of delivering. There is really not much to say about it other then four letters. EPIC!When you watch this movie, don't read up. Come in unprepared and let the story just unfold before you. There is really nothing bad to say about this masterpiece.

214,niff-49405,A short thrilling experience,7,2 April 2018,"So I'm definitely late with seeing this movie but definitely glad I saw it. From the first frame I was intrigued with the story to the end. I think this was because of the world the main character is thrown into and also the unpredictable nature this movie had.Some good suspense was then created from this and also some made pretty scary scenes due to the music and especially the visuals, makes me kinda wonder if I would've been a bit freaked out watching this if I was a kid. Talking about the visuals, I also really like this movies unique look. One last positive I'll say is the movie does leave some things open to interpretation. But there was a part where they did reveal certain things that I thought would've been better if that wasn't revealed. Other than that I did find this to be a really good movie that I WOULD DEFINITELY RE-WATCH and RECOMMEND checking out.",9
215,turleyliamanders,9: Not quite a 9/10,8,21 September 2018,"9 has intrigued me since I saw the first trailer on the Coraline DVD. It had a eerie tone: one that frightened and excited me at the same time. I finally got around to see if after years of speculation and wonder, and I'm glad it finally happened. The first thing I noticed about this movie is that is has a very quiet and subtle feel. Sure, there are intense scenes with loud, destructive and flashing effects, but our characters, especially 9, the protagonist, feel almost timid. The settings are often calm, desolate and barren, which set this kind of tone. I also notice there's not a lot of dialogue in this movie, and what does exist is there to move the plot forward, rather than develop the characters or create more captivating relationships. It is something that I surely would've loved to see expanded and supplemented to this film. If the film's length was expanded, this is something that would greatly fill up that time. Speaking of the desolate setting, I found myself very mystified and fascinated with the dystopian wasteland that our characters traveled through. It seemed very vast and felt like it had a lot more potential. Another reason to expand the film's running time. I watched this almost 10 years after it's release, so I could definitely give this movie some slack, but I found myself disappointed at the animation quality. The animation, not the character/world design. The character/world design, in fact was very unique and pleasing to look at. I am greatly curious to see what this film would look like if it had been stop motion animation. I am glad the main characters are all rag dolls, because the human animation truly looks like video game animation. However, it wasn't something that constantly bothered me. The story is very, very simple. The danger and tension doesn't put anything other than our characters' lives at risk. The world is never in danger. The only thing that is at stake is the characters' lives, but it feels very perilous despite the size of the problems. After all, the world is already destroyed, and all they have left is each other. No wonder our characters fight to protect each other throughout the whole film, because it's what they're fighting for. Even though the stakes are very small from a worldly perspective, the losses and failures our characters make are very real and impactful. Once I finished the movie, I thought to myself that this movie was a simple story. Short and simple, and I very much appreciate. It was fairly refreshing to see a story where there are so little characters and vessels of life. It made me even more intrigued to keep watching as I went along. Despite my small distractions with the animation, and the not-quite-fulfilled characters and relationships, I nonetheless found myself very entertained and filled with wonder. This movie had a lot of potential, and if had at least another half hour to fill with world-building and more information about the scientist's past, I would have been much more satisfied. However, I am still very pleased with the mysterious, ominous, and simple story.",9
216,sandlerds,One of the greatest films in my opinion,10,30 November 2020,"I liked the story in my opinion but the real film comes from the animation. The film shows horror in such a unique way of showing giant robotic creatures (that would be the size of a dog to a human) that chase tiny little rag dolls throughout a torn apart city. Seeing the movie as a kid terrified me which is amazing because it shows that horror films don't have to be blood and gore to scare the audience. If you're someone that likes Corraline (which you should also watch) or movies in the style of Tim Burton, you will have a blast with this film",9
217,danielcronk,"This movie had such potential, such promise.",7,26 September 2009,Good movie but I went in with too high of hopes. The preview for this movie make it look totally epic and it defiantly had its moments and cool scenes but I wanted more. In my opinion they needed more hardcore battles with epic music (like from the preview). One of the great things about the movie short which this was based on is that it was completely unexplained. I think for this movie they either should have explained more or explained less. It ended up coming out a little cheesy and might have been better if it was left up to your own imagination. I was left wanting to know more about this world but it seemed to quickly end. I think one of the best parts about the movie *spoiler* was before 9 could talk. It seemed so much more mysterious.,9

220,dan-2754,Criticizing This Film for Using Archetypes is Short-Sighted,9,9 January 2010,"I was quite taken with '9', a movie I saw without reading the reviews here (which is not the usual sequence of things for me). I'm glad I didn't read the reviews this time, though, because too many of them seemed to me to be off point.This is quite a didactic film with a decided moral and spiritual flavor from the opening scene to the beautifully crafted ending. It uses archetypes and plot lines that are more or less predictable and common. But it combines those elements with -- as most of the reviewers here have agreed -- wonderful visuals to create a sweeping story that is at least wonderful and borders on the magnificent. I was enchanted with the rag-doll characters from very early on and frankly don't get it when reviewers here say they couldn't identify with these touchingly and endearingly humanoid creatures. So much more empathetic than, say, Wall-E, of which it is only vaguely reminiscent.The spiritual message in this movie is deeply interwoven and -- perhaps because it resonates with my own spiritual path -- I found it quite well done and sufficiently subtle that remarks to the contrary here seemed to me to derive more from disagreement with the spiritual philosophy than with its presence as a major component of the story.I highly recommend this movie. It is entertaining and enlightening. The only thing that kept it from earning a very-hard-to-garner 10 from me was the overuse of violence in the late-middle portion when the denouement should be closer to the surface.",9
221,nreed1-1,I nearly fell asleep to the sound of bad voice acting.,4,20 September 2009,"Literally, this was the first film I've ever considered taking a nap in. The plot is just plain boring. There's basically a single plot thread, but its most interesting elements are unoriginal, predictable, and told using convenient narrative constructs rather than through interesting characters or dialogue. The nature of the burlap dolls running around is ill-defined, and at times contradictory. All the characters are painfully flat and static.There wasn't a single scene in the movie that didn't have some element or another that I found distracting. Over and over in my head I was saying, ""no, No, NO!!!"" Most audiences find the computer graphic aesthetic redeeming, but for me even that was substandard. Having some experience in computer graphics, I couldn't help but seeing the burlap dolls as texture-mapped meshes rather than characters.No comedy, no romance, no adventure. Just a bunch of animated burlap dolls walking around with questions, but not getting any satisfying answers. Not for kids. Not for me.",9

I love the idea of these little puppets living in the apocalypse and fighting against the remaining evil robots. While the plot is great, the action scenes are average, the movie is very short, and some great ideas are not explored. Since these guys are so small, I was expecting some clever sabotuer scenes, but all we get is a rolling barrel of gas. I was also very intrigued by the idea of using various scraps as weapons( Kitchen knives as swords, a mini crossbow that shoots fish hooks, etc.). But, like I said, it's not explored enough. You should rent this movie, because it is good, it's just kind of rushed and half assed. A great attempt, but please try harder next time.",9
224,ladydoom001,Coraline meets Terminator,10,12 October 2009,"9 is one of those rare movies where its director, writers, actors, etc. deserve to be called 'artists'. Despite its A-grade cast, it never felt like a purely commercial production. This movie is a work of art, from its camera-work to its music. The camera-work was superb; it transcended merely showing what was happening, it became a portal to the emotions of the scenes and its characters. Its music was dramatic and fit in well with the overall theme of the movie. Animation, plot and emotion were other aspects deserving of applause. The animators were especially adept at creating the expressions on the characters' faces, despite their lack of facial features to work with (they're basically ghetto-fabulous dolls). The plot was logical yet illogical; logical in the sense that it was understandable and one thing led to another, illogical in the sense that the story was highly imaginative and almost unbelievable. Tiny cloth dolls fighting enormous metal monstrosities? Any scientist in their right mind would have at least given them mini-rocket launchers. Portrayal of emotions were a high point of the film, the lighting and environments helped to build and maintain the dark, moody and lonely feel of the film. This was made the whimsical premise more believable and the characters relatable.9 is, contrary to what other people have said, IS a film you should take your kids to. That is, unless your family lives in a cave and has never been exposed to the filth and idiocy that permeates many shows. Little boys will love the action, and little girls will love the adorable characters. It's a relatively safe movie for your children, and you'll enjoy it too!",9
225,b-farvefan04,Feels like a different version of several action movies.,7,10 January 2010,"I will admit that this is a really good movie. I just think there is one problem. It has that Machine vs Life kind of story, I can probably think of 20 movies that are like that. Also, before I continue on the Machine vs Life, I will say that many of the action scenes probably saved the movie. The animation is amazing, the ending was interesting but not confusing when I think about it. Back onto the subject, it is very similar to Terminator but the ""heros"" of terminator are not rag-dolls. It might have been a big difference if the machines were from alien technology. To finish this up, the movie was good, but it felt like I have seen it before.",9
226,zigsz,Brilliant mix of Action & Atmosphere,9,17 April 2010,"Wasn't at all what I expected. I took my kids to see this (Early Teens) & it went down well with us all. It is set in a post apocalyptic world where all organic life has been extinquished due to a war between man & technology. Whats left are 9 little sack dolls created by a scientist during the last days of mankind, living in the rubble of a ruined city, trying to survive against the last of the hunting machines. A voice over explains that these sack people have the key to salvation of humanity.The sack people were endearing when set against the violence of their situation. Brilliant action sequences come thick & fast. But this leads to the films only problem - its sheer speed of plot makes it hard to follow its direction & sometimes purpose.Still this is a great movie. Atmospheric & brilliantly animated. A surprising & fantastic cast of voice actors. This is sure to become a cult film.Caution: It's not gory or sexual but still might be a bit too much for younger children.",9
227,JaegerMeister85,Entertaining,7,28 January 2010,"The animated genre has picked up a ton of presence ever since Pixar came around. Before Pixar there was only Disney and now it seems anyone can come out with an animated picture. I was very intrigued by this movie since Tim Burton was a co-producer but many times this can sway a movie, kind of like Michael Bay producing the Texas Chainsaw remake. But this was different. The movie has a dark edge but i think it was very well put together. The voice acting is fantastic especially from Elijah Wood and John C Reilly, who was actually hard to pick out at first. The movie is not intended for young ones as the message would go way over their head but I think with all the Pixar movies coming out recently this holds it own. Where as ""Up"" has reached over the ""kid"" perspective so has 9. This is a good movie with messages that abound throughout. See it and see what Tim Burton was all about.",9

Many people say that it didn't get deep enough into the characters such as 3 and 4 or 6 also 8 didn't get much screen time although he is mainly comic relief. 6 was my favourite and I would consider him the most innocent of the stitch punks. In this film I felt that when each doll died it was supposed to mean something different instead of just having it like oh another ones dead lets move along. Well anyway I all around felt this movie was good enough to compete with some of those big blockbusters of 2009.,9

It really shows how humanity's destructive tendencies led to the destruction of life on earth. People who dislike this movie, dislike it because they're to accustomed to the fact that many animated films are mostly for children that they didn't bother focusing on the plot, or it didn't meet their expectations for action. I think people really need to look deeper into the story and see it for more than just an animated film. I admit that I had my doubts when I first heard about it, I didn't know what to think about it and because of that I regret not seeing it earlier this film was one of the few films that I have seen that really made me think about life, and had a lot of meaning to it.

About cowardice, bravery, courage, cleverness, stupidity, loyalty and cruelness within us. About the balance of those. About the moral choice. About deciding what you want to be and what you will be. About something that concerns everyone. Yes, probably, the storyline and characters are bit corny and contain some degree of clichés. But for me, just a commonplace viewer with no particular knowledge of complex movie analysis, it is not that important. The core thing is what the movie is about; what it wants to tell. That is what I pay attention to. Worthwhile movie to watch. Enjoyed it. I am sure, everyone will be able to discover curious details and underlined ideas for him/herself. Enjoy.",9

For me, 9 was a great movie in that it had so much depth to it - these small characters were so well created that you cannot help but allow them to manifest within you throughout the movie. Their struggle is one we constantly focus on in all forms of media nowadays - life in a post-apocalyptic world - and despite this fact of being derivative, 9 adds something new to this ever-explored frontier. I went in with only mediocre expectations, and was greeted with quite the good film. From the stellar animation, the awareness of the effects of light and dark, to the interactions of the characters, 9 creates a really REAL feel even with burlap dolls as the main characters.",9

The plot could have done without the spiritual touch at the end, but I still enjoyed it. Burtons movies are a feast for the eyes as always. I did really wish that there were amateur-actors in this,I could identify half the cast by listening to the voices alone,and that always bums me out a bit.

Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies...The writer could have done so much more with the entire concept, but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started.Overall, too much hype but not able to deliver.",9

This movie has showed me that you don't actually have to have anything like that.I could sum it up simply as that. But, IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. not compelling in the slightest. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days, but there is no passage of time and i'm pretty sure it all happens in an hour.If you are looking to entertain yourself, then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up.

I thought that each character represented different facets of humanity---courage, loyalty, determination, honor, and affection. I also loved the look of the film---brown and gray and gritty.

242,jangles102001,Could have been good.,5,3 January 2010,"Let me start by saying this movie had potential. The beginning started off genuinely mysterious and creepy. That quickly shot off to the ""humanitarian"" doll ruining all the other dolls lives. It was however visually pleasing and had a sense of a fantastical setting. ""THE MACHINE"" was actually a very good engineer and created some interesting and creepy machines. My personal favorite was the one that stitched them into submission, that I will refer to as stitch. After about 30 minutes into the movie I was hoping seven of the nine dolls would have died and that the last two dolls would have just turned it into a mortal kombat scenario for the last 45 minutes.The plot, which was not explained until the last 15 to 20 minutes, didn't make any sense. I first thought the burlap dolls getting sucked into ""THE MACHINE"" were dead, but the movie proceeded to hint that they were just ""trapped"". So instead of destroying the machine, as 9 is a big gay doll, they decide to take the object that is causing the ""soul transfers""... by taking it and destroying the machine anyway. But who cares right, they apparently succeeded anyway. Well this too is wrong. I guess the only thing it did was to release the souls of the dolls to ""heaven"". So I spent the last 20 minutes watching my two least favorite dolls, nine and seven, giving the other doll's souls peace.The bottom line is I was intrigued by the great setting and visuals, but the plot doesn't hold water. If this is a movie you wanted to see then you should see it (it's no unrest for crying out loud), but if you were on the border or did not want to see it, then you better watch something else, or go play littlebigplanet.",9

But to my surprise it contained none of the weird creepy aspects of Tim Burtons movies, and was really well made, a lot of thought went into everything, I watched the bonus videos on the disk and you could see from the way everyone was talking about the movie that the director(Shane Acker) put so muck work and dedication and love into the movie, and it really showed it is a brilliant movie, and I adored it.",9

The movie beautifully presents a new angle to it, though probably not new enough to write home about.Clichés abound throughout the movie--the music, and even the voice of 9 (Elijah Wood) sound trite (the latter possibly due to watching LotR movies dozens of times). The action, although enthralling, depends a lot on lucky close-shaves and a bit of the 'deus-ex-machina'. For most of the movie, I expected something powerfully epiphanous to occur, but the anticipation went unfulfilled.The Animation and Special Effects are beautiful. The objects, settings and the 'image' (particularly the use of Low depth-of-focus) are reminiscent of the works of Brothers Quay, though this doesn't have any of that macabre quality.Viewed thoughtfully in hindsight, the plot does have some substance. In this microcosm, the puppet-characters seem to be symbolic of individual human traits--covering a spectrum of black gray and white, which, in a complex way, comprise our 'soul'. There are many symbols and allegorical elements. An act of thoughtless curiosity (the activation of the machine) leads a people to disaster. Troubled folk seek sanctuary in an abandoned church, led by an orthodox, power-hungry figure. In the face of a full-fledged assault, the sanctuary burns down, and man is left to use his own wits to ensure his survival.Because of being an isolated essence, each of these puppets seems to be a stereotype--this fact, if not appreciated, encourages the perception of the movie as being full of 'clichés'. Once it dawns, this realization vindicates the movie, albeit not completely.While the movie leaves somewhat dissatisfied the mature and expectant viewer, it offers a fairly enjoyable experience to both the young and the old.",9
245,blacksabbath-3,Don't waste your money,5,9 September 2009,"I was expected a very good movie from Shane acker, but i was disappointing. Yes the film effects were great but the story line was awful and hard to follow. For example on the first part when 9 was just create he sees 2 get taken away and he already wants to go and save him not even knowing anything about who he is or where he is. The movie is one of the shortest movies I've seen in a long time, Only an hour and 10 minutes (without the credits) but there are some ups to the movie as far as the action goes. But wait for it to go to the library and rent it there because there is no need to waste your money. But since Americans are used to American animation they will be astounded by the amazing Japanese animation.",9
246,nhicolaee,Other point of view !!!,10,15 September 2009,"O.K. Maybe we saw too many movies about this - end of the world, man against machine, relentless A.I., ... O.K. Maybe the movie is a sort of ""cliche"". O.K. Maybe the characters are a little dull . But with all these let's watch the movie from an other point of view : as a passage to so called "" grown-ups action movies "" for the ""small"" teenagers. I have two kids who really enjoyed the movie. Actually... me to. For that I think it's brilliant !",9
247,lobkes,Better than graded,9,22 October 2009,"I found the aesthetics of this animation absolutely stunning. Very, very beautiful indeed.It is animation, it is entertainment. If I want a deep and profound story I tend to read a book not see an animation.Why I feel the urge to respond on this subject on this website is because I find that the grade given to this film does not suit the film. I found it visually stunning and to me a film is quite visual and visually this film was very beautiful if not stunning (did I use that word before?).Ciao now.",9
248,ashleykosasih,I only wasted 90 minutes,6,12 September 2009,"Going into see 9, I was thrilled. I was prepared to be blown away, but I left much less thrilled than entering. First, the story was weak and the whole time I was left wondering what the purpose of the numbered figures were until three quarters into the movie. Not only that, there was a monster that constantly wanted to kill them and take their souls for some reason. I just figured out that it was some kind of fetish or OD that the machine had. The machine had with multiple arms and a giant eye, something I have never seen before in movies with machines gone bad. The visuals were good, but definitely not as spectacular as I imagined. Another flaw, the voices. They were painfully bland and boring. Whoever thought to use Elijah Woods needs to realize that not all actors can be voice actors. At times, it was difficult to tell the difference between some characters unless I was looking at the them speaking. However, the only voice that I appreciated was '1'. Go ahead, why not see it. As long as you don't have high hopes, you won't be too disappointed. You're only wasting 90 minutes, thankfully.",9
249,zachbuth,Well....umm...the animation was alright,3,12 September 2009,"My friend called me up to see a movie tonight, I wanted to go see Gamer but he said 9 looked really good so we should see it. My response was ""it's animated, what makes it look so good,"" and while he couldn't specifically answer the question we saw it anyways.Before I start criticizing 9 I will give you the two upsides. The animation was alright, it didn't blow my mind but it was well done. The second plus about this movie is that it was short, really short, like 79 minutes. I'm not even sure why you would make a movie so short but they did, usually it's a bad thing but I am going to make it a plus because I was tired and wanted to leave.Yeah...you know a movie isn't worth the money if being short is a plus. And about my comment that the animation was well done, I stick to that, however the environments were so bleak that it really didn't even matter. The puppets or whatever they were called really didn't have any character, and the action scenes,while decent, all had the same outcome. The little puppet guys get owned by some machine, then either run away or fight it off with a little knife-like weapon. How a machine can get destroyed by little sacks with a blade small enough to hide in the palm of your hand beats me...but they did it anyways. And then we get to the plot. I will say this, if the story-writers really thought through the plot enough to patch the gaps and give backgrounds on the characters, maybe it would be alright, however the plot has more holes than a cheese grater. In a nutshell the story begins with 9 (the main character) waking up, finding other little sacks, losing sack #2, finding #2, then accidentally killing #2 by awakening a big machine. Then the machine attacks their sanctuary and steals numbers 7 and 8. While trying to get 7 and 8 back, 1, 5, 6, and 8 all die....great job there #9. The movie finally concludes with the machine being destroyed and the remaining 4 being super happy even though they destroyed something they just awakened about 2 hours ago and killed 5 of their friends. The ending quote is ""it's our world now, we can do what we want with it."" Yeah the only flaw in that is that they are the only 4 living beings on the planet, 2 of them can't even talk and they will all be wiped out because they can't reproduce, or at least it wasn't implied.Alright i'll admit it, while everything I said about the movie is true maybe I did exaggerate a bit, obviously there is more to the plot than that but I am not exaggerating this....don't waste your money and 79 minutes of your time. 9 was one of the most bizarre and confusing movies I have ever seen, and the worst part was all the wasted potential, there was so much more they could have done with the story...should have gone to see Gamer.",9

There are many contributing factors to the overall appeal.The Animation: AMAZING! one of the greatest animation films i have ever seen, vivid detail to the finest bit!The story escalates too quickly and if you pay attention to too much detail, makes the experience less enjoyable.There is, however, some cool underlying symbolistic ideas such as: -Apocalypse -Man v.s.

After watching this movie I can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of yours... did you even screen this movie? I mean seriously, what the f%#k?Without giving anything away, here is the story in a vague nutshell... Nine wakes up, he does stuff, his actions and decisions are irrelevant... and the movie ends. Oh wait... here comes a spoiler...Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert! At the end of the movie.... it rains.

252,anna_desu,Multiple viewings strongly suggested,9,14 September 2009,"Much like Shane Acker's short (of the same name), this movie almost REQUIRES multiple viewings for the viewer to really soak everything in.The first time I watched the film, my initial criticisms were ""That was too short"" and ""There wasn't not enough emphasis on characters/story"". However, after watching the movie a second time, I realized that I had missed a TON of information on my first round. Upon asking other friends what they thought about the movie the second time around, I discovered that they felt the same way.The first time I watched the film, I felt like everything flew by. It was visual overload, and it just had bad pacing overall. However, on my second viewing of the movie, I noticed that things seemed to go by much, much slower. The pacing seemed better. I noticed character and plot subtleties that I simply did not catch the first time I watched it. I connected more with the stitchpunks, and I understood the story better. The visuals weren't just ""Ohhh, pretty!"" anymore, they had greater symbolism, and depth.The movie is, indeed, about 20 minutes too short. Certain characters needed more screen time, and certain points in the plot needed more emphasis. HOWEVER, I found that I enjoyed the movie drastically more when I saw it a second time. I plan on seeing it a third time later this week.This movie reveals new surprises every time you watch it. If you have seen it once already, and didn't think it was that great, I strongly suggest dropping the $8 and giving this movie a second chance. You may be surprised how much your opinion changes.",9
253,willtonight,One hobbit to ruin them all,5,14 September 2009,"Shane, I get it, you had to sell some of the vision from the wonderful short to corporate Hollywood for funding. However, you did not have to hire Elijah Wood to do the voice of 9. I had to shower after seeing this film to wash the gay stickiness off. The short was dark, and full of character development and brilliantly devised. The film, while the animation was great and the landscape compelling, the storyline was schmaltzy and bad.In the short, 9, with the help of 5, finds and constructs a light staff. This is done wordlessly. The character development in that 30 second piece was greater than all of the character development in the whole of the film. - In the film, that same idea was reduced to nine pointing at a light bulb and saying 'hey, this will work'. All the wonder was completely lost.If you go and see this, don't go expecting the brilliance of the short film.",9
254,smileykylie001,"Beautiful, but rushed.",6,16 September 2009,"My boyfriend had been talking about this movie since he saw a preview last month. We both love Tim Burton, so yesterday I agreed to go see it.The movie was beautiful. The art was interesting and seemed to have a very unique twist to it. Each scene seemed to paint a very creepy, yet artistic view of apocalyptic earth. The characters too, had their own complex and original look to them and the machines kept me drawn to their bizarre anatomy. Burton definitely did well with creating a creepy atmosphere. The little boy behind me buried himself into his mothers lap most of the film. As art of the film kept me interested, the plot did the opposite. I will admit that there were times when I felt curious about what would happen next, but when my questions were answered I was very unsatisfied. There was no character development and everything seemed to be crammed together to speed it up. I felt like I couldn't keep up, yet I didn't really care to fall behind. Also, for all the the Harry Potter fans, I had dejavu from the Last two books. How many horcruxes where there?If the plot had as much of a creative intricacy as its scenery, It would of gotten a 10.",9

Mr. wood did another very similar scenario in lord of the rings. there was hardly a beginning and an end... the spirits = SO cliché. I thought the animation was great. but they should have taken it in another direction. its like the people working on the storyline completely half-ass-ed it and said ALRIGHT lets just slap everything we've ever known together. they should have just left it on you-tube or something. and the different pieces of the souls... stealing for harry potter now?

256,escolnik,Just awful!,1,27 September 2009,"This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. There wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. Examples>The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. >The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????>And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either. Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.",9

258,lconroy-553-323648,I love it but who to share it with?,9,29 October 2009,"""9"" is a brilliant and totally innovative work from Shane Acker with some possible evidence of producer Tim Burton's hand on it. Apart from the obvious post-apocalyptic and parallel universe statements, the plot drips with symbolism: from the occult, Nazism, biblical to myths, legends and archetypes. A sort of Star Wars meets Mad Max in Oz.It's impossible to say it's really authentic borrowing heavily from everything including the archetypes of Freud & Jung to the big-eyed cuteness of ET. (The characters also look like they are wearing the weird gas masks of WWII.) However, it is presented in such a way that it is possible to become absorbed in the movie rather than merely analyze it. Then, because it stays with you long after, the obvious continues to reveal itself.9 is obviously the last (after him would have to come 1 plus 0 to make 10) and if the Source, the scientist, is zero (0) he can't breed with 1, but only make him in a masculine-leader image from his own soul or personality. In the Hebrew alphabet 10 is symbolized by yods. These yods or raindrops - some might say amoeba for the slow crawl of evolution - fall after the dead 'numbers' have transcended 'somewhere over the rainbow'. (Clever imagery of the addicted suicider Judy Garland image on the record). Yods are also depicted on the The Tower or Mars card of the Tarot symbolizing destruction of man-made objects with the iconoclastic intention of destruction and rebuilding, hence earlier references to Hitler's master race initiative.When 9 is left with the only female, wise and brave 7, she is the Princess Leia of the tale and they have their ready-made Cain and Able, the twins, in order to start from this barren Garden of Eden to populate the Earth again. These sweet and naive twins are the CP-30 and R2-D2 of Star Wars. The wise ""1"" is the King Arthur or Obi-Wan Kanobi, who has lost his vision for his people and also his eye sight. The Oz Scarecrow lookalike has his mouth sewn shut but yearns for a brain, however he is really quite intelligent but attributes this to No 1. The Beast is the snake, ghost and dragon of mythology; the boat that takes the dead 'number' on the river Styx is heading straight for the Underworld of Hades, via the Greek tragedy.The writer/director must have studied philosophy, occult, psychology, religions, astrology and so on before borrowing heavily for his film but presenting it in such a unique way that it makes compelling viewing and is 80 or 90 minutes of edge of the seat viewing. His craft is amazing – he has given the Souls jointed fingers and the need to stretch to straighten out their stiff little canvas-sack-meets-armour bodies to stand. With a tiny curve of a straight-lined mouth, a smile appears.The spiritual aspect of the movie abounds with images and references to the prophets and avatars, especially the sacrificial Christian lamb on the cross, although in occult symbolism they are fiery pentagrams – especially clever when used at No 5's funeral. The scientist in his God-like manner created 9 to save the world! Monty Python had the search for the Holy Grail, George Lucas had Star Wars and Harry Potter has his Hogwarts. Even Dan Brown has made his fortune with The Da Vinci Code. This movie is worthy of belonging with these classics.",9
259,alex_ursell123,Animation at its finest,6,26 October 2009,"I'll keep this short but sweet...the animation and action was truly amazing in this movie(especially in the end battle sequence),and if thats what your looking for next time your in the cinema then i suggest you give this a watch...i think however most hardcore movie fans will feel this left a lot to be desired because there really wasn't much of a story to it. i think they could have spent a little extra time explaining the plot and giving the characters more of an identity to help us as the viewer understand exactly whats happening and why. i did like the movie simply because of the animation but i wouldn't pay to see it twice",9
260,blau_himmel7,Flawed pieces make an incredible whole,10,4 November 2009,"Walking into the movie theater, I had no knowledge about what I was about to see. At first, I was skeptical - the main character was a canvas doll. As I recognized what could only be Danny Elfman music, I sat back and was ready to be blown away. And I was.I think perhaps the beauty of 9 was its simplicity and simple faith. While I agree with many other reviews that character development was lacking, I did find myself mourning the loss of each of the dolls/robots. We seem to expect a full spectrum of emotion and character of each of the robots, yet their overall simpleness denoted exactly the circumstances in which they became conscious - a world without human contact or emotion. As we find out that they are parts of their creator's soul, they can no longer be taken individually, but must be viewed as a whole. I feel this goes for the entire movie. While flawed in parts, the overall composite is masterful and thought provoking. I have not thought nor felt so deeply about a movie in a very long time.",9
261,juliet-staveley,A visual banquet,9,12 December 2009,"As a long-time fan of animation, I like to believe (misguided or not) that I have high standards and am not easily impressed. But this creation blew me away, so much so that I felt compelled to write my first ever review on this site. Please forgive me for the abundance of clichés that may follow.9 reminded me strongly of my favourite short-work, Joacquin Baldwin's award-winning Sebastian's Voodoo. The detail, backgrounds, colours, forms, the dark 'grubbiness' of the overall look, the minimal but meaningful character expressions and sublime use of light and shadow were pure heaven for the eyes.Imagine, if you will, a strange but beautiful lovechild of The Borrowers, Voodoo, Alien, Corpse Bride and War of the Worlds; and you have 9.The atmospheric score and use of imagery from various real political movements and historic events added to the post-apocalyptic, almost Gothic feel. To prevent it from becoming too heavy, it is interwoven with a deliciously subtle humour and creativity - such as the use of ordinary household objects as weapons and items of clothing. You can tell that Tim Burton had more than a sprinkling of input.Yes, the storyline is simple (which is why I am puzzled that so many viewers found the ending difficult to grasp) and the characters could have done with more development. That said, I immediately fell in love with 2, 4 and 5 with no knowledge of their past - a difficult task to achieve. And it would be hard to create nine full-blooded personalities with back-history involved in a complex plot in only 80 minutes. Which brings me to timing and the only reason I knocked a star off - I felt it ended too quickly and I just did not want it to.It is a rare sort of exquisite film-making that makes you want to serve it on a plate and eat it raw, enjoying every last mouthful. Then savour it all over again because you know you've missed so much in all the glorious detail.It is a film that stays with you long after it ends. I would urge anyone with a love of the unusual to experience it.",9

Shane Acker you shouldn't have made it. oh my god what is with the ten line min WTF i should be able to wright as much as i want because some movies are not worth ten lines i could not even make one line for this movie it was that bad. And the only kid in the audience did not like the Nine ether i wanted to walk out but my hubby has it in his head that if you pay for it you have to stay and watch the whole thing no matter how bad it was. OK i am up to seven lines what more can i wright about to be able to submit this review to tell people that Nine is not worth going to the cinemas for if you must watch this movie wait till it is out on DVD save your money for a better night or day out.,9
263,aserbe,"Interesting, thought not perfect",8,10 January 2010,"As someone who hasn't ever been too much of a faithful Tim Burton follower, I didn't know what to expect from ""9"". But the trailers made it seem interesting and I heard good things about it, so I went to see it. I was very pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this film a lot, and will definitely buy it on Blu-Ray(because the visuals are absolutely breathtaking, and it deserves the best quality available).The ensemble cast does a great job, from Martin Landau as 1 to Elijah Wood, as 9. They all do a great job putting forth a character that in every way fits the their roles. The weakest point of this movie is the plot. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but then again I've liked it every other time I've seen it. The movie obviously borrows from iconic post-apocalyptic films such as Terminator. It's not that the plot is bad so much as it's simply ""been done"". Finally, I found the oddspiritual twist near the end refreshing. It was not expected, and despite the polarizing effect it has on viewers, I enjoyed the fact that the movie ends with a bit of hope, and a feeling of David and Goliath victory as the small ""stitchpunks"" succeeded in restoring life to a dead planet.So, what I guess I'm saying is that by no means is this a flawless movie(but then again what movie is?) , but it is Definitely worth your time and money to see. It's a great movie.",9
264,LuciusMare,"A movie with great potential, however badly used.",7,25 January 2010,"I have seen once a trailer for this movie, and nevermore, but anyway, i was actually interested. So once I came, with great expectations. However, they were not fulfilled. It has a great beginning, i dare to say, epic beginning with moral, which is nice. Overall, i was happy with this movie and i think i can spare these few bucks to see that, but there were some things that really took me the feeling from the movie. For example, the thing with 2 - alive,dead - they cry,alive,dead - they laugh at the catalogers a while after. If they would love him as a part of the family, i don't think they could act like nothing happened just after death of their friend. Also, same thing happens when losing other members of the party. Seriously, one ""No!"" can't justify it. Also, i think that some really important parts were too short, while going around and thinking was the rest of the movie. I really loved the concept of them, the figures, it has a great potential. Catalogizers were just great. But i can't get rid of the feeling that it is ""Your average action blockbuster"" let's say, 9 started the madness but nobody cares, they act like nothing happened, they keep him in the party. Also, he is the only one that wants to do XY, while all others want to stop him - no, i am right, let me do that - see,i was right (apart from all the mistakes i had made). That really bugged me. The best parts of the movie are beginning and the end, beginning is great to look at the destroyed earth, also, ""REVOLT!"" just makes the atmosphere feel very well (not mentioning the molotov-at-robot scene). And, the party was very lucky, look at the scene where they run from something, they magically miss everything, dodge all things flying and outrun fireballs, bullets and so on. It all felt like a PC game, i couldn't shake the feeling of looking at it and imagining playing as one of the characters (torch-from-lightbulb-creating scene, it would be a nice puzzle), and pretty straightforward story. Although, i was sad at the ending, i expected them all to get back into their bodies, or something. They lost important parts of the party (2 as a knowledge guy, 6(?) as a big muscleish thing to keep safe) but at the end, they got a boy, a girl and two guys that have knowledge. So, at the end, i liked it, but there were mistakes. I give it nice 7, it was above average.",9
265,getinthepool1,Psychology,10,3 February 2010,"This film is superb. It is visually stunning.The comments by other reviewers here about the plot narrative are obviously based on the views of people who know nothing about Psychology. Traditionally, one of the basic theories of personality development was proposed in the 1940's (just right after Freud was writing) by A. Maslow. His ""Hierarchy of Human Needs"" is seen as a pyramid, with the bodily functions at the base and the spiritual attainment at the tip. #1, the primary organizational needs for a living human, center on hunger, thirst, sleep, the instinct to procreate, and the fear of being killed. When a human being is ""stuck"" in the primary personality, there is only the desire to exist, and all other thoughts beyond survival don't make sense. A person moves through the spectrum, through safety and creating a home, community and family relationships, self-esteem, achievement and respect, and finally the moral, creative and evolved human qualities. Maslow proposed that a healthy, well-balanced person who had not been stuck in any of these levels would progress through all of them during one single lifetime, and achieve a sense of actuality and connection. The theory has been compared to Buddhist thought about levels of spiritual enlightenment. The two ideas have a lot in common.Seeing the film ""9"" with this in mind will deepen your understanding. The ""War"" between the machines and the humans is a metaphorical war, not a literal war. It is the reality that we are fighting inside ourselves between the human, biological life of physical needs and closeness to others against the mechanistic desire for information and need for technology. As humans we must work through all the levels, and if we skip to the mechanical ""brain"" we cease to become human. We lose our compassion for others, and our sense of ourselves. The personality that literally ""divides itself"" is a schizophrenic (someone with a ""split mind""), an individual who is the parts and not the whole. Psychology tries to re-integrate all of the elements back into a personality to achieve the complete person (not without flaws) who can be fully human.I admit I only saw this film once. I must see it again to grasp the significance of all the numbers in their roles. I'm sure that the ending, where certain numbers ""die"" and become re-integrated into the world as spirits must have a larger meaning. The numbers that remain must be significant for carrying on the mission.I loved this film. It takes a lot of thought and contemplation to understand. I hope those of you who want to struggle with the metaphors will continue and watch it again.",9
266,benchaves,A Simply Magnificent Spectacle,9,20 February 2010,"Perhaps you have read several other reviews of this film and heard about the 'lack of story', and 'lack of character development'. Well, let me put one thing straight. Whilst yes, the film does dive into the action, perhaps a little too soon, and yes, maybe the developers should have made the film slightly longer in order to fix this, this film is still one of the best films I have seen in a long time.Let me start on the plot without giving too much away. '9' is based in a post-apocalyptic world, where this 'rag-tag' (sorry, simply couldn't resist the pun) group of rag dolls band together in order to survive against a set of destructive machines intent on attacking them. Now, whilst first watching this film, within the first 30 minutes, my initial thoughts were: 'Hmm, well, this plot needs more depth.' But come the rest of the film, it soon delivered in a means not used enough in today's films. I mean, in the art of what I call, 'self-provocation'. The film seems to almost challenge the viewers, attempting to get them to THINK for once in a film, rather than spoon-feed them every last detail. Now, don't get me wrong, the film does have a clear plot, although the film (well, as stated by others) 'clearly' wrap up, it leaves it open to each viewer's interpretation, and is wonderful.The characters, also stated to be undeveloped I believe fit perfectly in with their roles (stated in the tag line). Each numbered doll does exactly what the tag line states they do, and it fills it out magnificently. And if you HAVE seen the film (I won't ruin it for you), you should understand during the scene with the video box and the professor talking to 9 (you'll know what I mean), you should understand why each character is undeveloped. A puzzle piece, is not a picture until the puzzle is complete after all.Oh yes, visually, it is stunning. I loved the environment, being dragged in to this world and I just found it simply astonishing. Overall, this film is ideal for one such as myself: the film challenges, instead of spoon-feeds, the characters, though technically 'underdeveloped' have been of few characters in ANY film, with such justification, and quite simply, I couldn't pull myself away. Whatever you do, you MUST watch this film, is quite simply; a delight.",9
267,goodman21,9 captures our souls,9,1 March 2010,"9 is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I congratulate Shane Acker, Tim Burton and all of the people who made this film for doing a really good job. It proves that an animation does not have to be just for children. The apocalyptic world is beautifully rendered, as are the stitchpunk characters and the robotic monsters. The back story is also well thought out, and the film is a delight (if a bit scary) to watch. Some people may find it a bit confusing, but that's because they don't pay attention. If you listen to what is going on, you should clearly understand what is happening. True, 72 minutes may seem a bit short for some, but I think that this amount of time is plenty. Also, the cast and characters in this film are part of the high quality this film has. Many stars such as Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer, Jennifer Connelly and John C. Reilly feature in this film, and their presence adds to the film's greatness. I would highly recommend 9 for anyone to watch, and I think if you enjoyed Tim Burton's other works and Coraline, you will enjoy this! :)",9
268,manubinu,A decent effort in the increasingly popular genre,6,21 March 2010,"Animated movies are clearly 'in' these days and there is no reason to believe that the hype will be over any time in near future. With the pace of technological advance, actually, one would expect quite contrary.Anyway, '9' is one of those movies that are not really time-wasters but are neither memorable experiences. Storyline is pretty predictable, once the initial set-up is defined, while animated characters are not making some strong impact and are rather shallow. Luckily, they are named by number (the main character being 9) which makes it easier to follow the story;) One aspect of the movie that I enjoyed most is its visuals with its dark, eloquent, post-apocalyptic surrounding throughout the movie, which gives to it the defining tone and feeling. It's not as witty as 'Ice Age' or as emotional as 'Wall-e' but it is a decent effort in the growing genre of animated film-making.Story: 6 Acting: .. Directing: 6",9
269,harringtonandrew193,Not Good,3,11 December 2010,"I thought that this movie was a waste of my time. It had a pretty good idea, but it was executed poorly. There was o point in the end and I was waiting for more description of everything. I wanted something to happen that didn't leave me saying, what just happened? If you like Tim Burton you may like it but it was just filled with plot holes, like why did the scientist even put the little creatures there? It was missing so much to even be called a movie. Although I did like the voice acting. Each character was spot on with the voices. Also I was kind of waiting for the characters to come back to life. They killed off most of them and it didn't make sense because 9 kept saying that they were not lost, but in fact they were dead. And the one character that you actually liked, was killed off. It was just disappointing. Just not a good film.",9
270,t_frommelin,what happened?,7,25 October 2010,"I saw this the other night and I was sucked into the dark, apocalyptic setting. I would not go so far as to describe it as realistic, it is more of a somewhat humoristic allegory of human history's encounters with the dark aspects of the human soul, I felt that a not so small portion of Tim's contribution shines through in the design. The world feels alive even though it's a barren wasteland, every small piece of it is littered with interesting items and charred remains of this formerly-human society, subtle hints here and there about what has gone wrong.I fell in love with the setting, it felt somehow more alive than the protagonists, and this is where this movie took a wrong turn. I Do admire a movie that is not afraid to throw the audience straight into the story without the so-often tedious character introductions that a lot of movies have, and this one actually pulls if off rather well, but after a while I started to question the motives of the main protagonist: 9. He felt alive, they all did. but why he had this relentless dedication to saving everyone he meets and take up the fight against this evil machine without any hesitation nor rest, is lost on me, I started to feel that this nr. 9 is nothing more than the standard-issue revenging hero that has to stop what he started, and I found myself not caring all that much about whether he would make it or not. The rest of the characters in the movie feels like they should though, clichéed sure, but interesting all the same.which brings me to the main point of my review; what happened? I cant help but feel terribly frustrated by the second-half of this movie, after nr. 9 realizes what had happened before and what his purpose is. the concept is genius, if I have understood it correctly, the scientist who made all the dolls in order to save humanity, put parts of his soul into them via some odd black magic ritual, meaning that they all are representations of some aspect of the human soul. this is not clear in the movie however, and I am still not sure this is the case, some characters behave accordingly: the mad one, the big brutish one, the dominant one, etc. but this is never explained nor even really hinted at in the movie and it's a loss, since the idea is really interesting.The second problem I had is not so much the ending (which it appears not a lot of people got) but the notion of a much more interesting ending that is neglected, it is explained that the main villain is evil because it lacked a human soul, and the scientist made an object which collects the pieces of human souls present in the dolls, an object that fits into the evil machine, and it suddenly appears as this enemy is simply trying to collect the pieces it's missing (the dolls) thus not destroying them, but capturing them. when I realized this I shone up from the problems i had with the characters, it all seemed to fit together in a surprise twist. but alas, instead of going through with this idea and convincing his friends into sacrificing themselves so that the machine would be good, they opt to destroy it and releasing their buddies' spirits into the sky in some improvised ritual instead. it was a big letdown.sorry for the long review, it's just so frustrating.TL;DR: Loved the settings, the characters: meh, the story could have been easily altered for a much better effect.",9
271,ducktape817,"Somewhat disappointing, but overall a great film.",8,2 February 2011,"In the summer of '09, a friend told me about a film coming out simply called '9'. I really could care less. Then he told me it was an animation that was PG-13. I got a little interested, but still didn't care much. Then he said it was produced Tim Burton. Then I was really into looking it up. The day I saw the trailer, I was hyped. When I finally saw the full film, I thought it was a fantastic film. The story isn't new, being that it's in a post-apocalyptic. Not new, but the thing that I thought was the best about it is how the characters are rag-dolls. There are 9 rag-dolls, each one with it's own personality and look. 1 is the leader, 2 is the inventor, 3 and 4 are curious, 6 is kinda crazy, 7 is the chick, who (of course) kicks the most a#$, 8 is the big and stupid one with a huge weapon, and 9 is the hero, even though he starts all of the bad stuff. As you can see, the characters are kinda cliché and aren't that creative. Another thing that I liked about this film is how the rag-dolls look. 1, who was the first to be made, is made out of sown together pieces of white leather (pretty sure that he's actually not, but it looks like it). His hands are screwed pieces of metal that are poorly made. 9 is made out of already knitted cloth and his hands are (in 2's words) ""hand crafted drift wood (his palms) and melded copper (his fingers)"". This proves that a lot of thought went into the making of the rag-dolls. One more thing I liked is how much expression the rag-dolls and machine-monsters show. The rag-dolls don't even have eyebrows, but there expressions show very well. One monster (The Brain) is literally just a mechanical eyeball, but it shows expression, again, very well. One more thing is the animation. Sure it does get a little choppy some times, but overall, it's fantastic animation (and C-G-I) But then, the movie does have it's downs. The first one is too much talking. There are only 4 monsters that fight and they all (exept the Cat-Beast) all die because of the environment that they are in. Secondly, 9's zipper. Its always open or closed with out 9 even looking at it. There's (I think) only 2 scenes that he actually zips it open or closed. Its not that big of a deal, its just annoying. Third, one plot-hole that lead to the climax. The Seamstress (a Madussa like monster) gets a hold of 8 while he is getting ""high"" off of his magnet. The Seamstress ties 8 up in red string and sews his mouth shut so he doesn't scream. After that, she goes to get 1. She ties 1 up, but doesn't sew his mouth for some reason. And she wasn't interrupted by 7 or someone else, she just forgot for some reason. In a few words, it does have it's kinda stupid parts that should have been touched up a bit, but 9 was a great and dark film.",9
272,Thrillhouse101,Very Mediocre,5,10 September 2009,"I don't think any word describes this film more than 'mediocre', the most exciting part of the experience was the Toy Story 1/2 in 3d trailer. When I first saw the trailer for 9 I was like ""holy that looks awesome...AND Tim Burton is involved! its good already!"" well I think the art style and premise were really good concepts but I felt myself getting bored quite often, even the action points were kind of ""meh"". I think they overused Tim's name to sell this movie, but thats just my opinion.The plot felt poorly explained and really linear (lots of back and forth, not much adventure). There are a few points in the film where the ""what happened to the world"" is explained but I found the explanation of it some what tacky or not very well thought out. I constantly felt like they had this great idea on paper but some how it just never panned out the way it was meant (or maybe it did). Too much time skipping (movie is rather short). I also felt the acting was pretty stale. The dolls weren't emotionless but the acting felt pretty robotic (not very much range or depth by any of them), which I am surprised because the cast was relatively good.It wasn't at all bad for a first movie by Shane Acker, this guy will probably have a good future in animated films if this is his forte and he keeps improving. Great concepts and style just poor execution I think. This movie is gonna make decent bank this weekend so there will be more films by Shane more than likely.",9
273,ezuniga-327-885509,Anyone who give it more than 5 stars is kidding themselves,4,14 March 2020,"The animation is fantastic, especially for the year of 2009.... but that would only get you so far with a crap storyline",9
274,jbehr542,Phenomenal animation/weak storyline,6,15 May 2012,"What happens when Tim Burton catches a glimpse of a college student's animation short that he likes? It gets made into a full-length feature film, and you can bet your bloomers that college student is poor no more.And so begins the story of 9.A rag doll wakes up and finds himself alone in a post-apocalyptic world. As he journeys farther into this world, he begins to meet other creatures like him. While it's apparent his new friends are cut from the same cloth, each is different in his or her own way. As the story progresses, a ""man vs. machine"" mantra unfolds and you soon find out that the rag dolls are the key to the world's salvation.The main thing that makes this movie a ""must-see"" is the animation. The life-like movements of the characters and the intricate detail paid to the world they inhabit play a big part in making this film a complete visual experience. My wife and I own the blu-ray version of this film and I can't imagine watching it in any other format. Long gone are the days of Looney Tunes and Peanuts cartoons. 9 has aged the classics and set the bar for future animation.Animation aside, the storyline, while complex and attention-grabbing, is a bit disappointing; there are some loose ends that don't get tied up and the end fails to live up to the story's initial hype. My hunch is that so much attention was paid to the animation of this movie that the storyline took a back seat. Still, it's worth seeing for the animation alone.",9
275,demon_trail,"Disappointing, frustratingly lacking.",5,31 May 2012,"Felt like it would deliver an action-y Matrix style dystopian film but it fell short- I couldn't empathise with the characters; the animation was lacking and the plot was difficult to get into as it was almost too simple and predictable. There were no twists or surprises and it was almost embarrassing at how you could tell what was going to happen. The resolution of the story seemed be childish and it's moral absolutes were disappointing. Only didn't give it less than 5 because of the Steam- Punk feel and some nice touches to the background story. I felt that if the voice actors had connected with me more and pulled me into the story then the film would have come off better, this might also have been hindered by the shape of the characters which made them weirdly non-human.",9
276,Pauleager93,Outstanding!,10,4 January 2013,"This movie was extremely well done. It was a great plot and kept me interested the whole time. I find that rare with animated films. I was a little sad that the ending wasn't a bit different but I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched yet. The voices of the characters matched up very well with the characters. The plot was also very unique. It reminded me a little of I, Robot but was a much better film and was directed in a much better fashion. The animation was so good there were a number of scenes in the movie that could be made into movie posters if you know what I mean. I recommend you see this no matter what age you are! I'm surprised that it took me so long to see this movie. It is also important to note the good soundtrack. It fit the scenes well and added to the suspense of a number of scenes.",9
277,paulglen,"Beautiful animation; undeveloped, incomplete story",5,11 September 2009,"This movie feels like it starts in the middle. I don't instinctively identify with robot rag dolls. So, for most of the movie I didn't care much about what happened to them because their plight, purpose, and origin are not explained at all until the movie is almost over. At that point, I felt like ""Oh, okay, if they had explained that in the FIRST 15 minutes of the movie, I might have cared what happens"". But they didn't explain it, and I didn't care what happened.I won't even go into the conclusion of the ""story"", except to say that it makes no sense at all and is riddled with holes and ambiguity.Yes, the animation is very nice. Yes, there are some decent action scenes. Those are the strongest points of the movie. But, honestly, beyond the unique look and style of the artwork, it's the same stuff, the same action, that you see in every other animated movie. Ho hum.Summary: nice animation, cliché action, underdeveloped plot, and very little story to pull the (over age 16) viewer in.",9

279,Melancut,"Great visuals, horrible dialogue",2,13 September 2009,"Rapturously good visuals: inventive, dark but grotesquely beautiful, wonderful action. Horrible execution of dialogue, character development and plot.There are some GREAT ideas (the original short film is worth seeing) but by the time it hit the big screen, they glossed over everything unique and intriguing about the story in favor of shallow stereotypes and huffy, histrionic dialogue. The premise was good, the execution just failed. Also: not real thrilled with the decision to make the fabric for one of the stitchpunks in the same pattern as that used for WWII concentration camp prisoners. That's a risky connotation to take in art, and I feel like the film was too emotionally cheap to have validated its use.Visual win. Character / plot / dialogue fail. Ackerman should have stuck with his strengths from the original short film. I'd watch a remake with a more experienced writer helping out.",9
280,captaindoctorghost,This film is one of few gems that explore the aspects of humanity,9,26 July 2016,"This film at it's core explores the idea of humanity and what it means to be human. It does this by exploring themes such as friendship, curiosity and discovery, family and the fundamental question we all ask ""why am I here and what is my purpose?"" What makes the film so unique is that it projects these onto the main characters which are small ragdoll like automatons who have been set with the task of undoing the wrongdoings of their creator. This film has heart and on a first viewing the core themes and story may be lost by the stunning visuals of the characters and the environment they interact within. So I recommend at least watching this film twice to really appreciate all it has to offer. This film is set In a post apocalyptic setting yet it still manages to feel so unique. The closest I can think as far as cinematography is The Book of Eli, yet this is much more menacing and darker. Although wrapped up like a children's film with the animation, it definitely is for a more mature audience.",9
281,bruno_gosse,Children will need more than 80 minutes to learn about the Holocaust,7,22 March 2010,"I was surprised not to read many comments about the obvious reference to the Jews and the Holocaust in this film; from numbers written on the puppet bodies to number 1 clear Judenrat leader figure and the debate about submitting to or fighting against oppression. This brings us back to an important question: can we turn history into a show? Can nice, friendly cartoon characters, with impressive sound and a story full of suspense help us to take the hours necessary to tell our children what, why, how, 'civilised' men did to others in the name of race or belief?There others references to the atomic bomb, the Soviet style oppression, but the main story is about a kind of god-chosen (the scientist) small tribe facing extinction. This is a central question for the Jews and for everybody when you ask yourself: what would I do prevent oppression; is it not too late to think only of my own defense?So, parents, be ready to open the door behind this nice film billboard.",9

All who dare compare Shane Acker to Tim Burton do Cinema a big disfavor. The Short film was great and intriguing in that it allowed room for the viewer to dream and imagine what is happening. When you then try to turn it into an alternate world post apocalyptic redemption, life resurrected tale, you have to be very careful. You have to make it longer than 79 minutes. Because you start to answer so many questions, not bringing it full circle kills the story. If you do the thinking for us, then answer all the obvious questions. Overall I liked it, it was just not great for me. I like the fact that #7 is a woman, so all have a little of a lady in all of us, 1/9 exactly?",9

Yet another wonderfully creepy and mysterious movie! I was so sad to hear that this movie is relatively unheard of! It should be known as a classic!,9
284,Zenblend,It would have been easier for them to have made the story sensical,5,4 October 2009,"From the first moment I saw little 9 get up and explore his world, I was reminded of some of the genius works of creativity that Newgrounds sometimes churns out—quiet, existential stories of apocalyptic despair. This led me to hope against hope that 9 would be a work with no dialogue from the robots. Yes, it would have been confusing at first; but I think it would have prevented the overly-Hollywood feel that the movie ended up having.From the moment that I saw 1's reaction to 9, I knew this movie would be plagued with clichés. Again, I hoped that they would kick these tired old character designs; but really, the only difference here was that the grumpy old man was mostly right in his insistence that hiding was the best option. I saw this; but I was okay with it. 6's antics were predictable enough; though I really was surprised that his character talked. Why would the seemingly traumatized fellow, who constantly, obsessively scribbles the same picture be of sound enough mind to hold conversations? So 9 and 5 head out to find 2. OK, that's reasonable. Sure it seemed incredibly rushed; but what of it? Inside the cave, though I would not have crafted a torch in an area with super-sensing robot dogs, that wasn't an issue, really. The problem arose after they rescued 2. Ignoring the overly-clichéd super fighting girl, jumping around like a Dragoon Knight, we have 9 inexplicably driven to complete the work that the evil dog was working on by inserting a talisman that 9 woke up with into a orifice. The machine comes to life and sucks out 2's soul. Good job there, 9. No way was the task of the bad guy going to end badly.Here we have the first chance for Burton to make a non-typical Hollywood movie. It occurred to me that the dog had intended for its own evil soul, since we didn't know that it didn't have one, to be passed on to the giant machine so that it could more easily commit heinous acts upon the robots for whatever, unexplained, reason that it had done so thus-far. So, in light of that, perhaps 2's soul was now controlling the machine. That would have been clever—for the great monster that the others fled from to be their close friend. Alas, it was not to be. The machine is, inexplicably, evil.The group, minus 2, returns to 1 and the others. After an obvious argument of ""you're blinded by your fear,"" they're attacked by new robotic inventions from the machine. A-ha, one might think, the machine has inherited 2's ingenuity and is using it against its enemies. No, no, it's just being inexplicably evil again. The monsters get away with 8's soul. Still ignoring the fact that 1 is right about 9 having ruined all of their lives, he insists on chasing after them. We notice that 6 has a key around his neck for no, as of yet, explained reason. Perhaps it will come into play later.It is at this point that I supposed to myself that perhaps the 9 of them contain the personality that was taken from the machine in order to stop it the first time. That it was eating souls in order to reclaim its full potential. Clever; but perhaps too complicated for the Hollywood crowd, looking for a Transformers with burlap.The group storms the factory wherein the machine is creating all sorts of little evils. 9 and 7 manage to provoke the monster, while 1 and 5 argue over when to blow up the machine with a barrel of oil. (Because man, for all his ingenuity, was incapable of using Greek fire before being wiped out.) The heroes all unite right as the factory goes up in an explosion. Hardly appropriately, they begin to celebrate with a phonograph playing ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"". The obligatory romantic connection between 9 and 7 comes about out of nowhere; but their love will have to wait—turns out that fire isn't enough to kill a super AI of death after all.As they run away and watch 5 get his soul eaten, 6 decides that they all need to return to ""the source""; and throws himself to the monster. Um, OK. This might have made sense if the story followed one of the more complex routes that I imagined it might.In a moment of changeover that would make Tyler Durden proud, 9 finds himself in the room where he woke up. The music-box that he opens has a lock but, no, the key 6 was wearing is not needed. It simply has a lock for aesthetics' sake. The ensuing hologram tells 9 that the scientist's soul was divided into the 9 robots, and little else. With this knowledge, 9 rushes back to the others.Here, I thought, ""a-ha, the scientist meant for the robots souls to be eaten so that his collective soul would bring rationality to the evil machine. Again, however, I was wrong.During the final conflict, 1 needlessly sacrifices his soul to the monster; and 9 somehow takes the talisman from the machine (despite the fact that 5 had tried and failed before it first awoke). 9 destroys the machine; and the souls fly around a suddenly-appearing fire, encircled by five graves. The souls manifest into the familiar faces of 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8, smile at the others, ascend into the sky, explode, and rain down in green, life-giving rain upon the land. Roll the credits.Another reviewer noted that this movie was one that was followed by a speedy exit. He was not mistaken. I honestly believe that it took more work to make the story nonsensical and pointlessly full of holes than it would have been to make it compelling and fresh.",9
