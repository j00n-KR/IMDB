0,SnoopyStyle,Mean Girls + Groundhog Day,6,19 August 2017,"Samantha Kingston (Zoey Deutch) and her friends led by Lindsay Edgecomb (Halston Sage) are the mean girls of the school. It's Cupid Day and the girls get roses from their admirers. Everybody assumes that Sam is losing her virginity to her boyfriend Rob that night at the party. The girls pick on the outsiders especially loner Juliet Sykes. At the party, Juliet crashes the party to confront Lindsay. The girls leave and Lindsay crashes the car. Sam wakes up and relives the day all over again.The concept is perfectly fine. The saturation of blue subdues the intensity. Zoey and Halston are fine for their roles. After an early reveal, it is obvious that Sam needs to talk to Juliet. The movie flattens as that moment takes a long time to arrive. The pace grinds down. An obvious way to add filler to the middle is for Sam to take a road trip. Juliet is the obvious ending although the ending is too precious. It screams trying too hard. Overall, there are worst YA fictions. This is not bad for the genre.",Before I Fall
1,claudio_carvalho,Surprisingly Good Teen Film,7,30 September 2018,"The popular Samantha Kingston (Zoey Deutch) goes to the high-school on the day known as Cupid´s Day with her best friends Lindsay Edgecomb (Halston Sage), Ally Harris (Cynthy Wu) and Elody (Medalion Rahimi).

""Before I Fall"" is a surprisingly good teen film with the story of a teenage girl trapped in the last day of her life. Based on the Sisyphus legend, the protagonist has the chance to make amendments to her futile life being kind to people that love her and becoming a better person before moving on.

2,Sleepin_Dragon,What a surprise!,9,27 August 2018,"When I read that this film was a cross between Groundhog Day and Mean Girls I nearly passed it up. Thank goodness I didn't, as it is a truly exceptional film, sure teen films have been done to death, but for a change the film contains empathy and soul, I know it's a cliche but Samantha's journey of discovery is well realised.The film is well paced, very well acted, and very engaging, I found it very easy to follow the story, and understand the character's motives.So often this type of movie features great ideas, but the execution is too blunt, Before I fall is subtle, engaging and excellent all round. I'm so surprised by its sheer quality. 9/10",Before I Fall
3,bombersflyup,Worthwhile.,9,9 July 2019,"Before I Fall is an excellent film, with a few drawbacks.I've seen quite a few re-living the day films of late, so it could of got tiresome, but it didn't. It's about saving one's soul. Sam died, but gets the opportunity to go back a day and be the best version of herself she can be. I hadn't seen Zoey Deutch in anything but that video clip with Ed Sheeran. She's an enchanting and wholesome lead, that I will be interested in seeing more of. Other than her best friend, her mother and her male childhood friend, some of the characters weakish.",Before I Fall
4,Hellmant,"Should become a cult classic, kind of like 'HEATHERS' or other dark teen drama/thrillers like that.",9,9 March 2017,"'BEFORE I FALL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A mystery-drama based on the popular 2010 YA novel, of the same name, by Lauren Oliver. It tells the story of a high school senior that discovers she's reliving the last day of her life, over and over again, apparently until she can figure out what she needs to do to make things right (in her life, and those of the people around her). The film stars Zoey Deutch, Halston Sage, Madalion Rahimi, Cynthy Wu, Logan Miller and Jennifer Beals. It was directed by Ry Russo-Young and it was scripted by Maria Maggenti. The film has received mostly positive reviews, from critics and fans alike, but it's underperformed at the Box Office (so far). I hope it becomes a cult classic.Samantha Kingston (Deutch) is a popular high school senior, that's planning to lose her virginity on the night of Cupid's Day. She dies in a car accident instead, with her other popular friends. The next day she wakes up to find out she's reliving the same exact day, and then the next several days she keeps waking up to find out the same exact thing. Samantha slowly realizes that she needs to set things right, in her life and with those of her friends, in order to hopefully change things finally.The movie is surprisingly insightful; in dealing with high school life, and the dynamics of being popular verses being an unloved outcast. It's something the very flawed main character has to learn, and better herself by learning, in order to finally set things right (for her and everyone around her). That's why I love this movie; it has a very powerful, and quite moving, message about how we treat others (and how we should treat them). It's also really well acted, directed and written. I can definitely see it becoming a cult classic, if enough people see it. Kind of like 'HEATHERS', or other dark teen drama/thrillers like that. It's that good!

6,tabuno,A Ground Hog Day Drama That Excels,9,11 January 2019,"5 March 2017. Sometimes it takes awhile for comedy classic theme to become an inspiration for a takeoff that has as much potency and emotional appeal as the original. So is the case with Before I Fall using Bill Murray's comedy classic Groundhog Day (1993) repetition of ""the same day."" Too often movies rip off the plot of a great movie with cheaper variations of the same theme without much originality. I can't even remember most of ""the same day"" movies. What makes Before I Fall so special is that it takes ""the same day"" and makes it its own, just like the poster in the movie which tells us to be true to ourselves in living life. So much crap happens when we don't.The plot of this movie is such that its really difficult to describe without giving away the major twist. Except hopefully one can infer the overall plot by indirectly mentioning another movie that hopefully few have seen and may want to see both simultaneously if that were possible. But another potent and emotionally compelling movie with a resonating theme is Jennifer Love Hewitt's If Only (2004).For an alternative relief one might also watch afterwards the comedy romance My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010) or Brad Pitt's character in Meet Joe Black (1998), or the delightful live-action/animation Run, Lola Run (1998), or the parallel plots in Sliding Doors (1998).What's valuable about this movie is its coming of age story that offers us the important lesson about how we effect others and the value of living life to the fullest.",Before I Fall
7,Reno-Rangan,"Not about a second chance, but infinite!",6,4 June 2017,"Even if you are not that into the films, you probably have seen at least a couple film related to 'time loop'. For me, this is like hundredth. When I first saw the trailer, I said 'not again'. 'Time loop' is just a concept, but the storyline for it drawn differently. It tells the story of a high school girl on the Cupid's Day, a special day for her since she has a big plan for it to remember. Like usual her day goes on and at the end of the day something goes wrong and then she wakes again on the same day in the following day which keeps repeating. Now how she's going to find a solution or the reason for it is covered in the rest of the film.Familiar them, but well designed storyline around it. In some way, it is same as 'Groundhog Day', though it is about a teenager and more serious and tragic tale. We sometimes wish for a second chance, that's how this film was developed, but even bigger scale with a small message for teenagers.Awesome performances, particularly Zoey. Predictable scenes, so I had thought of couple of ending that did not happen. And I also disappointed how it concluded. Not the best solution, yet an unexpected twist. Originally the film was based on the book of the same name. This is a small budget and a quality film. The direction was good, very rich in presentation. Definitely not bad for once viewing.6/10",Before I Fall
8,cruise01,An interesting concept about teenage drama and being caught in a time loop in this dull direction film.,6,29 June 2017,"Before I Fall is like the teenage drama version of Groundhog Dog or the sci-fi Edge of Tomorrow. Playing around with the concept idea of the main character repeating the same day over and over until they try to solve the link to escape it. Before I Fall is decent for its teen drama that is about a bratty senior and her group of queen B friends being the bully to students who are not on the spotlight like they are. When an accident leaves one of them to repeat the same day before the accident. She has to figure out and fix all her wrongdoings. It is a fair film, it has its decent performances, and a okay story. The plot follows Samantha (Zoey Deutch) waking on the cupid day, were students can send a rose to their secret admirer or boyfriend/girlfriend. Samantha gets picked up by her queen B friend Lindsey (Halston Sage). And than the other two Ally (Cynthy Wu) and Elody (Medalion Rahimi). They joke, talk about rumors, losing their virginity, and also make fun of students that are not up there with their classy style. They go to a party, where things go awry when Juliet (Elena Kampouris) insults Lindsey about her bullying which she gets attacked and thrown out of the party. Samantha and her friends head home until they get into a car accident. Samantha wakes up from the experience to only see that the day has restarted all over again. Several attempts of trying to save her friends. She has to solve the mystery of her déjà vu and fix all her wrongdoings to get through the day. It is a concept that's been seen in other movies before. Sure, other movies were better adapted in different genres like Groundhog Day, Source Code, Edge of Tomorrow, etc. Before I Fall is not terrible. It has its cliché written script. A decent story that is about trying to be open minded to others perspectives. It tries to be that doing the right thing movie. Except the character development in the movie was quite thin. Samantha is not exactly a good high school girl. She follows her friends at all times. Even when they insult and make fun of another innocent girl for her appearance. Could this whole déjà vu day repeating be a learning lesson for Samantha? What about her friends, whose behavior is worse than hers. Which I feel like her friends is going to miss the point of how their actions affects others. Zoey Deutch gave a decent performance with her character. Which I have not seen her in much besides the tedious Vampire Academy and eh Why Him. The script was cliché with decent dialogue. Plus predictable. Samantha and her big shot boyfriend did not seem promising. When she sees her longtime childhood buddy who seems to care for her and is afraid to make something of it cause of her friends. Yes, it is easy to see where the direction goes. Overall, Before I Fall is a fair drama film. It has a concept idea that tries to be a learning curve for anti bullying. And some decent performances. It just filled with cliché written characters and a dull direction.",Before I Fall
9,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,6,18 May 2017,"Expected this one to be worse. The reviews of the critics had it like a teenage movie with a sad ending. But I trust the author (of the book) and so I tried this one. And it wasn't that bad. Sammy had something more in her, more than Mean girls gone dead sequel. She wasn't as much of the bully and the it girl of her school, as she was the follower of queen b and her two other best friends. The story starts with the teen drama (a popular girl celebrates valentine's day with her friends and prepares for the big night with her boyfriend). Only her night doesn't go as she expected, as she has a car accident, after which, she wakes up in her bed only to relive her last day again and again. At first, she tries to change things. Gradually, and after a period of denial, she decided to make the best out of it, and she starts to spend her time with her family, emending their broken relationship, and people that she used to ignore in school. Eventually, the movie gets a deep dive into the character's personality and the students around her, like her friends, her boyfriend, the boy who is in love with her, the girl whom she used to bully. The mystery is that big to keep you thrilled, but the action is good and the development of Sammy's character is interesting. The performances are good and the filmography beautiful. So, 6 out of 10.",Before I Fall
10,jtindahouse,Its premise kills it,5,1 March 2017,"I'm a little bit torn as to how I feel about 'Before I Fall', because as a movie it's a horrible mess. Yet at the same time the message that it is trying to get across is quite a beautiful and profound one. The film explores the theme of appreciating every moment in your life and treating every day as if it could be your last, and it does that very well getting its message across clearly and memorably. The problem is the 100 minutes of run time it takes to get there can be very tedious. It feels like we are just getting the same information over and over again - which I suppose in a way we literally are. Putting aside the problem with the overall premise, the writing is actually quite good. There is some well written dialogue and the character arcs and interactions are believable and interesting. The acting is pretty solid from the whole cast as well. Halston Sage in particular continues to impress me in every role she takes. She has a natural ability to steal scenes without even appearing to try to do so.The main problem with 'Before I Fall' is that it cheats. It just decides to break all the laws of the universe and make up its own ones to suit its story. This is a lazy thing to do. The best movies get their message across without doing this, at least not to the extent 'Before I Fall' does. For this reason it's a film that's hard to love. You can appreciate it for what it is, and maybe it will even make you think twice about the way you live certain aspects of your life, but just judging it purely as a straight up film, it's not that good.",Before I Fall
11,DarkVulcan29,Zoey Deutchs performance really sells the movie,9,12 March 2017,"Zoey Deutch who is the daughter of actress Lea Thompson and film director Howard Deutch, proves here she is quite a captivating actress, really gets in the moment of what is going on, you really feel her struggles. Hope more good roles will come her way.It's easy to compare this to Groundhog Day, story of a teenage girl played by Deutch, who is caught in a time warp of repeating the same day over and over. And like Groundhog Day(1993) not much of a reason is giving, but instead let's the audience try to figure out the reason, but has it goes on the film starts turning into an odyssey of self discovery, Zoey Deutch plays it to perfection.But everybody else is pretty good here also, like Logan Miller, who for once playing a nice guy, which for a while he so rarely plays, he was quite good. So was Jennifer Beals has the mom. Some may call it Groundhog Day the teen drama, but the performances here, made say differently.",Before I Fall
12,stevendbeard,Teen Lesson Learned,6,4 March 2017,"I saw ""Before I Fall"", starring Zoey Deutch-Why Him?, Beautiful Creatures; Halston Sage-Goosebumps, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse; Logan Miller-The Walking Dead_tv, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.This is a young adult sci-fi mystery with a lesson on how to be a good person thrown in. Zoey is a teenage girl in High School, just hanging with her three best girl friends. Halston is pretty much the leader in their group. After a fairly average day, in the life of a teen girl, there is a car crash and Zoey wakes up in her own bed in her own house, starting the same day over again, ala Groundhog Day. After a little bit of confusion has worn off, Zoey tries changing things up to try and get out of the loop before it resets, but no such luck. At least she learns something new about becoming a better person. Logan is a fellow student that has a crush on Zoey-but is completely ignored by her-and Jennifer plays Zoey's mother. It's not a bad movie. I'm just not it's target audience, a teenage girl. It's rated ""PG-13"" for drinking, bullying, violent images, language and sexual content-no nudity-all involving teens and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-I'm not the target audience, remember?-but it would be alright as a rental.",Before I Fall
13,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Before I Fall,8,20 July 2019,8/10 - a truly terrific teen flick that encourages a healthy dose of self-reflection,Before I Fall
14,Jackbv123,"Pain (Spoiler hints, but only hints)",9,12 January 2019,"When I saw the synopsis, I thought I would like this because I am into Sci-Fi and I loved Groundhog Day. During the first 15 minutes, I was thinking ""what a mistake"". This is definitely not my style of movie. I'm 65. I would guess this appeals more to the under 25 set especially because of the music and the language and the attitudes. Are normal teens like this? I have to guess that many are. Certainly the exclusivity of the little cliques, especially the popular kids. I would guess there are a lot of high schoolers that feel better about themselves by putting down other people. Sam said it when she got of the car - ""I'd love to hear what you say about me behind my back.""Then after it got past the first few cycles, some really thought provoking ideas started cropping up. Dealing with the pain. Doing something beyond yourself. Love and who is family. This could possibly be a really good movie for parents to sit down with a teen and talk about.On the last cycle, when she left the house, I said to myself ""OMG she's ...."" Well that's a spoiler so I won't finish it. My gut hated it, but it was a very interesting twist.",Before I Fall
15,kluseba,A contemporary feminist take on Groundhog Day,7,28 March 2018,"Before I Fall is best described as a contemporary feminist take on Groundhog Day. It tells the story of high school student Samantha who seems to have a quite normal life. She lives with her friendly parents and her good-spirited little sister. She has three best friends that stick together through thick and thin but who can also be quite arrogant and mean. The four girls bully a shy and silent girl with a very strange behavior at school. Samantha has a male childhood friend who is depserately in love with her but she also has a good-looking boyfriend who is quite popular among girls. It's Cupid Day and Samantha's clumsy childhood friend throws a part at his house as he hopes to impress his crush. Samantha is though planning on finally losing her virginity to her boyfriend and is morally supported by her excited friends. Things turn sour when the bullied girl unexpectedly comes to the party and gets into a fight with Samantha's best friend. The shy outsider runs away while Samantha and her friends feel frustrated about the ruined party and decide to drive home. On their way on a dark road, their car hits something and Samantha dies just to wake up in the morning of Cupid Day again. She realizes she has to figure out why she must live the same day over and over again. Samantha tries to organize some changes and experiments in her life to break the time loop.There are several great elements about the film but also a few downsides. Let's start with the negative points. The story line is rather unoriginal and the plot development quite flat at times. The movie is at times also overtly sentimental. Since the movie is mostly about Samantha, her three best friends and the strange girl, it's a film that might appeal more to female than male audiences. Witnessing the four girls bitching throughout considerable parts of the movie was quite tiring. I must also say that the male characters are all quite one-dimensional. The only two male characters of interest are a superficial womanizer who wants to sleep with the protagonist and the clumsy childhood friend who nearly stalks the protagonist.The movie also has many positive elements. I really like the film's gloomy and mysterious atmosphere that isn't just carried by the plot but by the wild landscapes of the American Northwest, the moody light techniques and the fitting alternative pop score. The protagonist's character development is particularly interesting to follow as she becomes very wise, warm and selfless throughout her fateful journey. The acting performances are great and especially lead actress Zoey Deutch convinces as rebellious teenage girl who rediscovers her good-spirited side. The movie obviously makes you think about your everyday life and daily decisions which gives some food for thought for philosophic discussions.In the end, you should watch Before I Fall if you like philosophic teenage dramas with a supernatural touch. I guess the movie might rather strike a chord with female than male audiences as well. While I really like this type of story, I must admit that especially the film's middle part was somewhat plodding. I personally prefered the similar but more vivid Happy Death Day as well as the Life Is Strange video games for a more mysterious coming-of-age experience.",Before I Fall
16,peterp-450-298716,The film got stuck in my head. Probably because it's so intriguing.,6,19 September 2017,"""Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you there's 1,000 or 3,000 or 10. So much time you can bathe in it. So much time you can waste it. But for some of us,there's only today. And what you do today matters.""Damn time loops. Bill Murray got stuck in one in ""Groundhog Day"" and could escape it by surrendering to love. And Tom Cruise had a less pleasant loop in ""Edge of tomorrow"". He died every time during an alien invasion. Samantha (Zoey Deutch) faces the same problem. A night out with her friends Lindsay (Halston Sage), Ally (Cynthy Wu) and Elodie (Medalion Rahimi) ends in a disastrous way, after which she wakes up on ""Cupid's Day"" over and over again. ""Cupid's Day"" is that time of year when youngsters in school give each other roses to show their love.If these bosom friends would bury themselves with red roses, nobody would really be surprised. Because these narcissistic glamour tarts are living in an egocentric, artificial cocoon, where there's only room for their stuck-up personalities. A life of perfection and complacency in which the other less-favored (both financially and in appearance) are criticized and mocked. These arrogant girls don't even realize that they aren't so popular just because of their looks, but largely thanks to their rich parents. This allows them to distinguish themselves from others materialistically. Driving a car of a somewhat more expensive class. Parading with Louis Vuitton handbags and exclusive clothes.""Before I fall"" fails in two areas. First of all, it's not very original. As I said before, it's a kind of variation on ""Groundhog day"". Except that the latter also had some comic situations. This film tackles the issue more seriously and has a much more important message on a moral level. And secondly, it's highly predictable. Once you know what's really going on and the facts are slowly revealed, you already know what will happen and what Samantha needs to do to break the cycle. You can even mumble the last sentence simultaneously with Samantha without a problem. As expected, Samantha walks through various emotional stages. From amazement and despair to fear and anger. Ending via a rebellious, fatalistic phase into getting the revelation where she suddenly realizes (although she has experienced that day already a thousands times) how she can solve the problem.It's kind of weird. I'm not really a fan of chic flicks. But because of the cyclic aspect and the sophisticated analysis of the different personalities, this high school drama was still fascinating. The interpretations also surprised me in a way. You can't say those girls are sympathetic, but gradually their intricate characters are revealed and you start to pity them. Especially Deutch delivered a brilliant performance. She looks like a fragile doll. A kind of ""Holly Hobbie""-like Gillian Anderson. A lovely girl with an innocent appearance. You don't see her as an arrogant, hateful and selfish person. The rest of the ladies are cut from the same cloth with their specific deep-rooted emotional issues. I hope they aren't so vicious in reality.The ultimate life lesson in the end is quite obvious. It may be a bit of an exaggerated arthritis-causing waving with the index finger in a moralistic way, but ultimately it's a truism. Perhaps some individuals in this world should focus more on the important things of life, instead of merely being busy with their own status. However, the ""I"" culture and social pressure are such that it's almost impossible for young people to see this. Perhaps this film should be added to the school curriculum used nowadays. However, I can imagine that some of those like-minded girls are shocked when they see the denouement. Shocked about Samantha's fate. But most probably they are happily giggling again the next day while bullying the lesser beauties. Oh well. But remember girls: ""Karma is a bitch!"".More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",Before I Fall

18,Amari-Sali,Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing),7,3 March 2017,"While Deutch shines and definitely shows she has something worth more movies, and maybe series, taking advantage of, arguably she is without worthy peers in this movie. Which, when combined with the overdone and familiar elements of this film, keep it from being something noteworthy. For the whole Mean Girls angle has been done to death and while the looping, Groundhog Day, narrative was put to good use, it isn't enough to say you must see this. The film definitely has its moments, but unless you are willing to give Deutch time to build up her character and setup the touching moments, you will get bored quickly. To the point that you may see this as a future Netflix & Chill type of movie.",Before I Fall
19,rgkarim,Before The Editing Falls,7,4 March 2017,"Today's review is on Before I Fall, a cryptic title that can symbolize so many things in the world of Hollywood. If you have seen the trailers, they portray this movie as another endless time arc installment where days continue to repeat until a solution is found. But outside of that, it was uncertain if the aim was horror, drama, thriller, or just straight up Sci-Fi. So, to solve this question, I'm back in the trenches to give you my thoughts on the film, in hopes of answering your questions. Let's get started, shall we?LIKES:  Great looking cast  Fun Soundtrack  Decent acting  Nice Story  Good LessonsSummary: Okay let's start with the shallower likes of the film with how great the cast looks. Before I fall's primary actors are beautiful, cute, and many are adjectives that people can use to describe them. Those looking to enjoy 90 minutes of eye candy will get their fill as Zoey Deutch and her teenage friends fill the camera with their flare. If looks aren't your style, and you go to the movies for music (ironic no?), then you're in luck because the movie has some fun tracks laced in that again are very fitting and for me toe-tapping as well. Okay enough of the small likes, let's get to the good stuff. Movies with an all teen cast are often susceptible to becoming overacted messes that are more annoying than anything else. Not the case for this film. Before I Fall's leading ladies have created believable relationships that describes the high school experience. The ""deep"" bonds of a click that are strong, yet so fragile, is a common element in this movie, as well as the hardships teens feel in the pseudo- adult world of being a senior. I felt the love, the hates, the struggles, and the anger all nicely balanced in this film, and kind of connected with some of the issues they had. While the acting is decent, the story is the stronger quality for me that drove emotion home. The answer to the question, for those who haven't read the book, is Before I fall is more drama mixed with the Sci-Fi quality of looped time (e.g. Mean Girls meets If I stay with Ground Hog's Day repetition). I don't know how the combination works for you, but for this reviewer it wasn't that bad given my initial expectations of horror. One of the things I appreciated, was how the diverse the days were. With movies that involve repeating the same day, often the scenes grow stale by the third iteration. While this happens at some points (the classroom scene), Before I Fall did a nice job changing up each day as Deutch's character discovers the problems in her life and grows as a person. And being a guy who appreciates character development, this movie's strongest aspect is indeed strengthening a fairly shallow character and teaching us some life lessons in the process, before the big ""twist"" (again assuming you haven't read the book).DISLIKES:  Lacking in some areas  Scenes hastily thrown together at times  Preachy  Drawn OutSummary: Film adaptations of books are always lacking given the time constraints and budget a film has. Before I Fall has a lot of things tied well together, but there are still some weaker components that need some amping up. The protagonist's life is surprisingly complicated for a teenage role, with many demons waiting to face Sami. I applaud their attempts to cover all these issues, and while they did a decent job, I felt some of the qualities were lacking. Many scenes felt rushed, or haphazardly thrown into the mix, lacking the needed development the book most likely had. This lackluster development resulted in fairly simplistic scenes that takes away its theater quality. What also took away from the theater quality was how preachy components of the movie. Hearing Sami randomly go into bouts of loving/appreciating her friends, went down the eye-rolling path for me, as they layered on the cheese heavily. But if you are about the deeper bonds of passion, and straight to the point dialogue, this dislike won't really affect you. But overall, this reviewer felt many of these dislikes led to an incomplete picture, with lots of drawn out moments to one of the two predictable endings that, while emotional, wasn't the big excitement I had hoped for. The Verdict:While I haven't read the book, Before I fall is indeed a nice refreshing taste on the teenage drama genre. The film seems to be a culmination of many movies brought into one story, with a creative use of the time-looping theme to explore lots of avenues that are missed in movies these days. Throw in some decent relationship building with some good lessons and you have what feels to be a semi-decent portrayal of the book. Yet, the film still needed some fine tuning in the editing compartment to bring full life to this rather simplistic (and clichéd) tale. Overall, this reviewer feels this movie is best left to a home viewing, but encourages you to send your teenagers and pre-teens to this film if you are looking for something.

21,bkrauser-81-311064,Getting a Bad Feeling of Deja Vu,4,4 March 2017,"I once heard that the studio brass at Columbia Pictures were initially hesitant on Groundhog Day (1993) because they thought the repetitive nature of the film's script would be too boring for mainstream audiences. While their initial trepidation ultimately proved false, Before I Fall, the latest film to add its own particular funk on the Groundhog formula, is digital proof that their fears were well founded. In fact, watching this YA rip-off of a good idea, felt like I was going through the lead's feeble little character arc in reverse: hopeful optimism makes way to exhaustion, which fades to anger then top it all off with big, fat helping of what the f**k just happened? This tepid little story comes courtesy of author Lauren Oliver's well received novel of the same name. Sam (Deutch), a popular Washington State high schooler, is forced to repeat the same day over and over again in a never-ending cycle of lunchroom gossip and pre-coital stressing. Why; well much like the aforementioned Groundhog Day no concrete reason is ever given; though that film was so artfully done, one needs hardly to ask. Here however, the movie begs that very question perhaps to distract from its stifling dreariness. ""Why is this happening to me and not to you?"" Sam asks her vapid friend, stone-faced and blunt.Good question Sam, though a better one might be why is this movie happening at all? It's clear within the first references to Sisyphus and the Butterfly Effect that this movie has no desire to tread new narrative ground. The progression of the story and its themes are beyond predictable and the characters are as safe as a bouncy castle made out of Nerf. The minutia that repeats and repeats is at best superficial and at worst annoying, accompanied by wraithlike hipster music that drones on and on. I mean for goodness sake even Edge of Tomorrow (2014) had the good sense to fill in its lack of existential exploration with creative high-concepts. This movie is just happy convincing you that rich high school girls still go out of their way to publicly taunt their less popular counterparts.One thing that Groundhog Day did well that Before I Fall seems to purposely be messing up is any semblance of a character change. While Bill Murray's Phil changed from a solipsistic a**hat to a kindly community angel, Sam turns her interment into a group therapy session where she's constantly asking if she's a good person. She hears stories about herself she seems to have forgotten; one dozy little nugget is even provided by a stereotypically sweet admirer (Miller) whose sole purpose is to remind her she has romantic options. Then of course there's the phrase ""Be the Person You Are"" that's literally written on a wall as if proclaiming proudly: Nothing. Interesting. Will. Happen.The good news is the movie at least tries to distract you with a marginally more interesting subplot involving artsy outcast Juliet (Kampouris) and head mean girl Lindsay (Sage). Details of the group dynamic are parceled out little by little to force engagement between the film and its audience. This can be seen as a net positive for those who don't mind all the witless melodrama that clumsily un-spools. Of course if you're far gone as I was, these little reveals do nothing but pad the run time of what is already an unpleasant little trudge through dullsville.To stymie any impression that Sam is just as shallow as her friends, we're made aware of her inner-monologue which crackles with empty platitudes and fortune cookie wisdom in an attempt to sound sincere. ""Maybe you can afford to wait. Maybe for you there's a tomorrowbut for me there is only today."" She speaks of course with misplaced intensity and sounds like a lissome pre-teen who's read one too many Sylvia Plaith poems. Yet behind all that self-seriousness is a total lack of faith. Absolutely nothing in this film is given shades or subtlety but rather falls out of the film like ungainly pitched garbage.What you end up with in Before I Fall's case is a film that marries its inherently un-cinematic concept to a story without depth, understanding or wit. Furthermore it latches itself onto boring, vacuous characters whose supposed faults ensure the stakes are lower than the price of a Lifestyle condom. If the message of this film boils down to ""make the most of today,"" then do yourself a favor and avoid this tedium at all costs.",Before I Fall

Sounds familiar right?It is impossible to talk about this film without comparing it to Groundhog Day (GD) even though it is completely different in tone and theme.Sure, this has a similar premise but this film takes the story in a completely different and darker place.This is not a comedy, it has much more of an edge than GD and manages to be much more stylish without becoming depressing. Rather than centring solely on the main character it looks at the persons life as a whole. Most of us have had occasion to step back for one reason or another and realise that our friends are being butt- holes - but we never noticed, which means we must be butt-holes too. This pushes out on that theme.The acting is absolutely amazing all around, the lead is staggeringly good. The script and story are fantastic, the sound track fits perfectly.This will never be the classic GD is, but it is a very slick, well made enjoyable movie that I am certain will not get the credit it deserves.",Before I Fall
25,rockman182,Before I Fall (2017),6,16 May 2017,"One whiff of the trailer and I thought ""eh not really something I want to watch"". I'm a mad man who watches everything though, so I was destined to check it out no matter how unappealing it looked. I'm also not a fan of Zoey Deutch because she's not in many good films (yes that includes Linklater's Everybody Wants Some). After watching the film my initial reaction basically came into fruition.So the film is about a girl (played by Deutch) and her friends in high school life. The film portrays the typical dramas of a teens life. This all includes crushes, being in a clique, rebelling against your parents, and bullying the others, basically the works. One day after a party Deutch and her friends go into a car accident. Afterwards, she keeps waking up to the same day over and over. She's in a time loop and needs to learn how to right the wrongs to escape the repetition and move on with her life. You may be thinking the exact same thing that I am. ""This film's premise sounds A LOT like Groundhog Day"". That's because it does. Its essentially the same thing, except its not a comedy and is set in the life of a teenage girl (also it isn't anywhere near as good. The film suffers from clichéd writing. Its not hard to figure out what needs to be done to break the loop. Also the film flirts with feeling repetitive because of the element of the plot, and it really does feel repetitive. You have a hard time identifying with the main group of teenage girls as they are at times vile and not worth a damn.This film is clearly made for the younger teenage audience. They may get a kick out of it and really enjoy it. For me it was something that is too familiar and not with a remarkable effect. I don't want to say it's unfortunate because, hey, I did not expect anything at all from this. If there's no expectations you can't really be disappointed. It is what it is, its nothing new but may appeal to a younger audience who probably aren't familiar with how unoriginal the film is.5.5/10",Before I Fall
26,dave-mcclain,"""Before I Fall"" is an intriguing and deep, but disappointing morality tale.",5,4 March 2017,"If you watch enough movies, you know that a few lucky(?) people get the chance to live a short period of time in their lives over and over again until they get it ""right"". Movie Fans saw this situation play out in ""Project Almanac"" (2015), ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), ""About Time"" (2013), ""Source Code"" (2011), ""Déjà Vu"" (2006) and, most notably, ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), a movie that became so well-known that its title has become synonymous with the ""time loop"" phenomena. Whether it's because of time travel or some mysterious force in the universe, whether it's a vehicle for action/adventure, drama or comedy, these films tickle the imagination and appeal to both the sense of regret and the hope for a better future that we all feel in our lives at various points. The 2017 addition to the above list is the drama ""Before I Fall"" (PG-13, 1:39) in which a high school senior gets trapped in an unexplained time loop on the day of her death and she tries to take the opportunity to set a few things right before she dies.Samantha ""Sam"" Kingston (Zoey Deutch) is part of tight-knit clique of mean girls for whom it seems that every day is pretty much the same (until it becomes literally the same for Sam). She wakes up to her cell phone alarm at 6:50 a.m. and she starts getting ready for school. In the process, she treats her loving little sister (Erica Tremblay) rudely, blows off breakfast with her family and acts dismissively towards her well-meaning parents (Jennifer Beals and Nicholas Lea). Sam's day only really seems to start when her bestie, Lindsay (Halston Sage), shows up to drive her to school. Along the way, they pick up the other half of their group, Ally (Cynthy Wu) and Elody (Medallion Rahimi), who join in on the mutual teasing, the gossip and the general pettiness. And the shallowness just continues in class as Sam's earnest young history teacher (Diego Boneta) embarks on his daily struggle of competing for his students' attention.There are a couple things different on this day, however. It's Friday February 12th, ""Cupid Day"" at school, and the girls talk about how many roses each of them will receive from their friends, admirers and crushes through the student delivery service. This is also the day that Sam has chosen to surrender her virginity to her boyfriend, Rob (Kian Lawley). As the girls discuss Sam's big night, they take a break to taunt the school's designated social outcast, Juliet Sykes (Elena Kampouris), when she walks by them in the school cafeteria. Later, in the hallway, Sam's childhood friend, Kent McFuller (Logan Miller), invites her to a party, which she says that she will not be attending. Sam and her friends do end up going, as does Rob. But when Sam sees how drunk Rob is, and after a raucous confrontation with Juliet, the self-centered quartet leave the party, only to get into a deadly wreck on a 2-lane road at exactly 12:39 a.m.The next morning, Sam seems perfectly fine as her alarm wakes her up in her bed at 6:50 a.m. At first, she thinks it's a mistake, but she notices that her family, and then her friends, are saying and doing the same things they said and did the day before. Sam then starts to think that she's in a dream or maybe she just dreamed the previous day. When the day goes exactly the same as the last day that she remembers and then she again wakes up in her bed and the cycle repeats, she starts to wonder if she has died and is in hell. It is a hell of sorts, a personal hell in which nothing that she says or does differently makes any real difference in the day's outcome. As she relives this day an indeterminate number of times, she is able to change some details which reveals more about what was happening in the background of the lives of her friends and family. All of this forces Sam to decide what to do with her increased knowledge and greater understanding of life and to see if she can change how the day ends.""Before I Fall"" is an intriguing and deep, but disappointing morality tale. Based on the 2010 novel by Lauren Oliver, and as adapted by Maria Maggenti and directed by Ry Russo-Young, the premise is interesting and the life lessons are valuable, but the space in between isn't very exciting. The repetition of the day is more like what we saw in the laborious 2008 thriller ""Vantage Point"" than in the entertaining comedy ""Groundhog Day"". As with the former, the reveals along the way are significant, but aren't enough to carry the film. With a little ""Butterfly Effect"" theory thrown in, there is much to learn here (especially for the teenage target audience), but it seems doubtful that many Movie Fans will remain engaged long enough for the resolutions of the story's threads to have the desired impact. What's more, most of the characters are hard to like and the ending is frustrating. Deep thinkers are more likely to appreciate the film, but most who see it will probably find it rather boring. It's a shame. Underneath it all, there seems to be a great movie trying to get out. It just doesn't quite make it. ""B-""",Before I Fall

Realizing this fact, she tries different approaches, trying to find out the cause and what needs to be done in order to stop this loop. Throughout the attempts, she slowly starts to acknowledge how people around her are and how she should behave in order to make everyone happy, or mad.It's a movie which is based on the fact that the girl repeats the same fatidic day and insists on it from various perspectives. It's interesting and quite thrilling, keeping you curios about what will happen in the end. It's a bit slow though and even awkward at times, while the whole repeating day could have been better thought, as well as the main character's actions.Still, it's a pretty good achievement for this type of movie which had a good idea and managed to create a good movie out of it, even without a fabulous budget.",Before I Fall

That makes this movie a successful and refreshing adaptation on the ""Ground Hog Day"" formula in its own way, because it has a setting of the final months of the last year of high school, when a lot of things seems possible, with pretty bright future ahead for almost every high-school teen. While the story may be incredibly similar to the ""Ground Hog Day"" the tone here is radically different. The movie does get better as it goes along, while Samantha, for the 1st time in her life, examines herself and her actions (a starting point in the film was moment where she asks her mother - ""Am I a good person?""). I must also mention lyrical photography that visible focuses on the beauty of the moment, showcasing at the same time Deutch as an effective and charismatic actress who delivers an incredibly layered performance as Samantha. At the beginning, her little life as a mean girl was useless, but at the end of the film she is a very different person because her concern now is not for herself, but also others. While this film is geared towards a teenage female demographic (written by a female, directed by a female, and stars several females in the lead roles, with basically just 4 male characters that here at all speak) I found the messages in the film universal and not just for teenagers.Rating: 8- (It is a wonderful little film and I'm surprised at how good this movie is)",Before I Fall

I watched this movie twice in two days, and would see it again with friends (if I had any--I'm a bit past the 'circle of friends' age, now married and over the hill). I relate to the humanity of this story, which never changes, even though I find it difficult to relate to ultra-rich American kids who are born and raised in the Pacific Northwest.

One thing I hate is being left hanging after watching an average 90 minute movie. I would have liked to have seen the aftermath. In other words when Sam finally ends up with the real fate that is supposed to befall her, I would have liked to have seen the aftermath of that, i.e. more about Lindsay and Juliet. What became of them? Did Lindsay turn over a leaf and change for the better? Did she reconcile with her longtime estranged childhood friend Juliet?

Plot: Samantha Kingston (Zoey Deutch) is one of four girls that makes up the popular clique at school. She wakes up on February 12, Cupid Day at her high school, ready to see how many of the boys bought her roses and ready to sleep with her boyfriend for the first time that night.

It's the morning for February 12 once again, and while the young girl fully remembers living this day already, she's fated to do so again, and again, and again.My Review: To a film critic, reviewing YA movies can feel like being forced to relive the horrors of high school over and over again. But to a teenager, that doesn't sound like such a bad thing, especially when the characters are pretty and potentially more fabulous than you are.But for me,Before I Fall made me fed up with this time-loop concept.The story unfolds by Sam learning new lessons for every loop.If not for good performances from lead actress,this movie could have been more boring.Off all the loops,the only loop which I liked is where she spends the time with her family.Zoey Deutch is good and only thing we can loom out for in this film.Halston Stage as kick-ass best friend is very good.As in the aforementioned Groundhog Day, the magic which causes Sam to repeat the same day is never explained and while that can be overlooked in a comedy, here it honestly could have used some details.So,Before I Fall is a typical time-loop take on clichéd plot.A strictly one time watch.My rating 5.75/10",Before I Fall

What once was a fresh topic has been repeated ad nauseam, tiring out even the most hardened viewers of mind-bending time movies. And ""Before I Fall,"" doesn't reinvent the wheel - it is a standard enough groundhog day-esque film that is inoffensive and entertaining. Where the film shines, however, is in its main performance and competently handled directing and visual style.""Before I Fall"" immediately has a level of competency and quality that I wasn't initially expecting. Immediately noticeable is the technical prowess this movie possesses, with breathtaking visuals of British Columbia and North Vancouver - the vistas are truly a sight to behold. More than that, however, the movie has a really good style to it with many moments that utilize the fantastic soundtrack to enhance the suspense or add to the entertainment value - a scene in particular utilizing the Yeah Yeah Yeahs song, ""Skeleton,"" I found particularly effective, both in its thematic resonance and in its emotional hook; the scene looks good, sounds good, and certainly kept me, as a viewer, engaged.So ""Before I Fall,"" on a technical level, is quality; how does it perform as an overall film? That's where things get tricky. As a whole, I highly enjoyed my time with the movie, its plot, and the characters it introduces. And when it comes to the characters, Zoey Deutch as Samantha Kingston is remarkable in this movie, giving a tender, beautiful, heartwarming performance that I found just lovely to watch unfold. Zoey is truly remarkable here, almost single-handedly carrying the movie - that's not to say the supporting actors are bad at all, but they are clearly not in the same lane as Zoey. So, as you can see, I loved Zoey's performance, as well as the character she plays; why do things get tricky, then?Zoey's character, Samantha, has a group of friends that are, frankly, vile. Almost all of them are revealed to be awful people, clearly lacking a moral compass. Zoey, with her newfound time-warping abilities, lives a countless number of days, and in each day, her friends are revealed to be more and more evil, toward her, and toward others. However, at the end of the film, Samantha still, and for some reason, thinks highly of her friends, even after the audience reveals that show them to be people who lack empathy. This was one of the only things I disliked about the movie - for a film about redemption, as Samantha was no angel herself in this movie, it's surprising to me that by the end of the film, after witnessing how cruel her friends can be, that she still manages to like, and even love, them. I found this aspect of the film unbelievable, but it didn't necessarily detract from my overall viewing experience.""Before I Fall"" is a heavy film, dealing with depressing subjects, but in a manner that is respectful and thought-provoking. Starring Zoey Deutch in a standout leading role, the movie has the star power, the visuals, and the competent directing, all combined with a genuinely moving plot that many will be able to relate to.

For me, some choices that they made thrown away much of the potential of story, as it is centered on a group of teenage movie classic ""pat's"", who with all respect ... WHO CARES?! Nobody cares about the group of egocentric girls! That they are so for no reason!For me it's there (and also in the dozens of clichês, both teen films and time-lapse movies) that the film is lost, so more than half of the film is very weak.An example: What is your first different reaction after finding out that you are in a temporal looping? Get up out of bed and be a bitc#! Of course!That said, I think that here begins the part in which I speak good things about the film. Until the last 10 minutes, I was going to give 4 stars for it. Like a say the film has a cool concept, with some very good ideas, and especially a beautiful message about life, however, falls into clichês and seems to be afraid of being 100% author In some moments (mainly in the initial half). But the finally really hooked me, the message that was beautiful could become even more beautiful, and then he is finally brave and out of the clichês, what you think about it is even sadder, because it confirms that the story had a very large potential.In the end, it is a fine movie, the first half is really bad, but the end saves a lot of points, and make the history decent besides all.The real note I like to give: 5,5",Before I Fall

If I dislike the main character we are in trouble. After a relatively tame run in with the ""weird girl"" her day starts repeating. And even though, in this world, she has never seen a time loop movie... she comes to believe that she needs to do the day ""right"".But none of that makes any sense. Nothing about that does anything, at all, to change things but she continues to persist.

Zoey Deutch is a good actress who portrayed her character really well.I don't know, but for me this movie had an impact. To sum it up, it's a very inspiring movie. It is just the right moment to watch this on a time when I need inspiration. Oh well. It's 10-stars worthy for me.",Before I Fall
46,WatchAndSmile,Pointless... High budget production meets low budget script,5,16 August 2017,"I love groundhog day movies and watch(ed) all that are coming out. This movie is beautifully shot with great cinematography, characters and actors did a good job in their roles. What was lacking is the point of the movie. Seems like the script is severely lacking. There's very little point to the movie and you get to see how everything will turn out soon enough. I was disappointmented with the movie the more I watched it and then came the ending and I was saddened by the stupidity of it. Basically the script was cheap,but the production $$ were great. Wish they spent a bit more time with the script to get it up to par with the production.",Before I Fall
47,gcsman,A cross between Mean Girls and Groundhog Day ...,5,29 December 2017,"... although the YA audience this movie is clearly aimed for may not know anything about those two classic (excellent) films. This one isn't nearly as good as either of them -- and one reason is its consistent lack of humor -- but looking at the IMDb vote breakdown, I see that (a) it appeals much more to females than males, and (b) it appeals quite a bit more to teens than over-20's. So I'll agree that it's succeeding in reaching its (limited) target.Samantha (Zoey Deutsch) belongs to a coterie of high school queen bees who spend their days manipulating boyfriends, tormenting the misfit Juliet (Elena Kampouris), and generally leading superficial socialite lives of coolness and casual cruelty. (This btw is so tiring to watch.) Things come to a head at a big party (stereotypically at a ""parents are away"" house) after which Sam and her vapid friends crash their car. Sam wakes up at the beginning of the (same) day over again, and off we go on the recursive time loop. It's unclear just how many cycles Sam lives through -- maybe dozens, at a guess -- but it is the push she needed to force her through a predictable process of self-discovery. The only real interest from there on is to find out how it resolves. I won't give too much away here, but she finally comes to the realization that, in some sense, she owes Fate a death but can make a difference in the process. It's only on the second-last cycle that she (and we) see at last how the various threads link together, and it's here that it actually takes a new path from either Mean Girls or Groundhog Day. The Message, such as it is, is simply that what you do every day counts, which is fair enough even if having been said many times before. But unfortunately a stronger message, which is the unspoken setting for most of the scenes, is that high school is hell. Most of us wouldn't care to relive it. (For a softer and thoroughly enjoyable girl-centered take on that theme, see Peggy Sue Got Married (1986).)The young cast has relatively rudimentary acting skills but they're not bad enough to be unwatchable. As the lead, Zoey Deutsch does a decent job and shows a fair bit of promise for future roles, though I hope she doesn't stay trapped in this limited genre.",Before I Fall
48,maximovlE,Wonderful,10,2 November 2020,"Wonderful is a word I rarely use, if ever, but I can't think of any other to describe this movie.What amazes me is that I almost didn't watch this movie. The opening scenes are horrible. The whole of the first day was horrible. I went in to the movie with no idea what it was about, which I find is the best way to watch a movie, so what I was seeing made me think I had stumbled upon some horrible teen coming of age movie. I wondered why on earth it ever made it to my watch list.However, Erica's reaction on waking up on the second day was, in my opinion, spot on, and very well acted. The bewilderment and confusion as opposed to the over reactions you would expect from other movies of even a vaguely similar type were probably what kept me watching. The feel of the movie instantly shifted in the right direction.I mentioned I hated the beginning? Well, I'm glad I did. It's hard to explain without spoilers, which I'm trying to avoid, but I'm glad my attention wasn't gripped early on, because by the end I had completely forgotten the major 'clues' as to how the movie would end. So, when it ended, I was left... surprised that it wasn't the typical ending that I expected.Overall I found it very pleasantly unexpected with a good message for all of us to take note of. Many will yawn at that and criticise, but I guess that just proves my point. Definitely worth 10/10.",Before I Fall
49,ReganRebecca,Better than I was expecting,7,16 May 2017,"I'm pretty much sick of teen movies and I'm pretty sick of repeating movies too but I gave this one a shot and I'm not sorry I did. Before I Fall is about Sam Kingston (a lovely Zoey Deutch), a stereotypical popular and pretty mean girl who is part of a popular mean girl crew. On cupid day (a day where the students at high school send each other flowers) Sam plans to lose her virginity to her longterm boyfriend Rob. Only at a party he gets drunk and makes out with another girl. Also crashing the party is Juliet, a former friend of Sam's who accuses her and her friends of being pathetic and bitches causing them to retaliate and throw drinks at her. Later that night as they are heading home the car Sam is in crashes but instead of ending up in the hospital... time loops and Sam wakes up on cupid day again. From here on she must figure out why time keeps looping for her and how she can stop it. Not the most original of plot lines and some of the writing is really bad and cliché. However Before I Fall is surprisingly watchable and that's down to the actors who are really great. Deutch in particular makes a really strong compelling lead. She gives the film her all so that even though a lot of the revelations and dialogue are trite in her hands it feels very real and warm. The film is also very beautiful, director Ry Russo-Young makes it very beautiful and compelling to watch. Not a revolutionary addition to the day-that-keeps-repeating genre, but a decent film nevertheless.",Before I Fall

On a technical level, everything works. The cinematography is probably the best part of this film, because it's gorgeous. There are some beautiful shots in this film. Everything technically is composed well. I just couldn't get into the story. In the beginning, the dialogue for these characters was just awful. It sounded like a forty year old man was trying to write dialogue for teenage girls. It did not sound believable at all. It never sounded like words teenage girls would ever say in actuality, but what people expect teenage girls would say. The dialogue got better as the film went on, but not much. The writing overall was pretty clichéd and typical. I could predict every single beat of this film before it happened, and there was nothing surprising about it. It's exactly what you expect it to be. That's not always a bad thing, but for someone who was wanting to see something different and a little more unique, it did work against the movie...",Before I Fall

As always, I watch films without watching trailers nor reading anything about them beforehand. I like to jump in blind. I do sometimes use ratings to choose what to watch. Anyway.-The brief one-sentence summary on Netflix immediately reminded me of Happy Death Day. Both films have the same basic premise. Both films came out in 2017, although Before I fall came out 10 months sooner. Before I fall is based on a 2010 novel of the same name. I wonder if Happy Death Day stole the idea from the novel, which this film is based on.On to a quick 100.00% spoiler-free review:-When I clicked on this film for some reason I expected it to be yet another mediocre film on Netflix and that I would fast-forward most of it just to get to see the plot as soon as possible. But early in the film I stopped fast-forwarding and ended up watching it instead.-The protagonist's acting was great. The supporting cast was weak and easily forgettable, but the protagonist carried them with her great acting.-It is clearly a solid and professionally made film. The story, directing, the screenplay, the setting, the mood, the costumes, it was all solid. Overall it is a very solid and well-executed film.-Pace was a little slow and the tone was mostly low, so I fast-forwarding a little bit here and there.-Climax and finale were great and memorable, albeit bittersweet. I think there is room for a sequel, although this film lost a lot of money, making a sequel improbable.Conclusion: this is a good film and it is a film worth checking out. I cannot find anything negative, except maybe the pace was a little slow at times. I will not say why I took off one star but it has to do with the story. Overall it is a solid movie and I would recommend it. The ending is memorable and made me think about the profound fact that as the movie says some people only really do have today, while the rest of us have many more todays (hundreds and thousands). It made me and surely all who watched it realize that we often take today for granted.9/10 - very strong, very solid, well-made, with strong ending.",Before I Fall

54,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Severely under-rated,9,12 September 2020,"Before I fall is a surprisingly moving and thoughtful teen drama about the beauty of life and being true to who we are. The movie boasts superb direction, well developed characters, gorgeous cinematography and a captivating plot. Zoey Dutch gave a very strong and compelling performance as Samantha Young, a girl who has strayed away from who she really is in favour of her popular friends. Each character was refreshing despite their cliche personalities, helping contribute to the main message of the film and being significant to Sam's character development. The movies main concept (Repeating the same day over) was handled really well and with lots of complexity ; We watch the various stages of Sam's ever changing emotions to this strange and unsettling new world that she can't escape, and the slow realisation of how she must approach it. Her reaction was very human, and never felt over the top or fake. Her fear, uncertainty and tears all felt genuine and portrayed with a lot of sentiment. Despite the rather sad ending, the movie felt satisfying as we witness Sam's powerful and thought provoking character development, realising who she really cared about and how she should treat others. Instead of feeling rather empty or depressed in the end, we feel more hopeful that we can learn from Sam and live to our full potential. The cinematography is worth noting for its stunning utilisation of the Canadian scenery. Finally, Kent's character was really sweet and unique. He wasn't the typical 'attractive' type, and yet still gave a swoon worthy and loveable performance as Sam's main love interest. Overall, a thought provoking and beautiful teen movie, that almost doesn't feel like a teen movie. Highly recommend!",Before I Fall
55,bluepink,"Great premise, but boring",3,21 March 2021,"I like the premise & the way it was concluded; but the overall execution of this movie was meh. After she did the first day, I quickly became bored of watching the same day happen over & over, with minimal progression in the storyline until the last 20 mins. I ended up skipping loads.Also, don't watch this thinking you're gonna get something akin to Mean Girls. This movie is not funny at all - but then again, I don't think it's trying to be funny.Update: After watching 'Ground Hog', which has a similar premise - I can identify the main issue with this current movie. Ground Hog very often jumped straight to the new things that he did differently in his day - which allowed the storyline to progress more quickly. Whereas this movie wasted *a lot* of time repeating unnecessary scenes - instead of on scenes that would push the storyline forward.",Before I Fall

The repetition of the day seemed a little underwhelming because so little was devoted to her actually learning anything, or trying to fix things. Why not approach Juliet at school, for instance? Try things that wouldn't end in her inevitable death? Think through what she was doing to Kent by finally returning his ""love"" (it actually came across as a bit creepy and stalkerish on his end) and racing out to die, likely leaving him a complete wreck? It was all too pat, and the upbeat/downbeat ending was too predictable (and the accelerating montage was straight out of ""Vanilla Sky"") It just felt like the writer and director were trying to wrap things up without putting in real thought and effort.So...an okay movie.",Before I Fall

64,johnplocar,"""Groudhog Day"" for teeny boppers.",4,3 January 2018,"Wow that was a major pretentious and misguided piece of trash. For about 95% of it being mainly forgettable with some annoying things sprinkled in, then with the last few minutes it gets into such unnecessary and manipulative crap trying so hard to be 'poetic' but it's not. This was dumb.The plot is that a teenage girl in high school winds up reliving the same day over and over again, a la ""Groundhog Day"" until she finally learns the value of life. This movie goes exactly where you think it's gonna go from the very beginning and it has a message that you'd expect from something like this but it does it so poorly that it makes the moral completely mute. I'm just going to have to get into spoilers in order to fully explain my problems with the movie that make it as bad as it is, so be warned.With the setup of the narrative we see this teen girl, Sam, she runs with the popular girls and they basically pick on everyone. Initially starting off on the wrong foot for our leads because they are so unlikable with how cruel they are it is near impossible to sympathize or even care to follow these four despicable monsters. Especially the leader of the girls, Lindsay, who is the sole purpose of driving a poor girl in their school to resort to suicide. Yeah...good luck making me like someone that pushes an innocent girl to want to kill herself. Luckily Lindsay isn't the lead, but she's still in second place for screen time shared and Sam only becomes likable because of the actress doing such a good job at working as hard as she does to make her seem relatable and not so terrible an individual as the movie goes on; even though it takes some time to actually get to that point.So the arc is pretty obvious from the start of the picture; Sam begins slightly corrupt but by the end of it she finds a way to redeem herself and in this film's context means that she must sacrifice her own life in order to save the girl that enacts in her own suicide by jumping in front of a moving car. That right there makes the entire arc that Sam goes through totally pointless since she slowly learns to be a good person, realize the path that she's heading down is wrong and will only result in tragedy if it continues, and all that is thrown right out the window so that the movie can jerk itself off thinking it's giving such a ""beautiful ending"" by having the lead character die and claiming her death ""saves the other girl's life"". There's no reason for it, it's forced and doesn't make sense, her death will only cause more harm than good if any good at all. Guaranteed her parents are gonna be a little more than distraught by her passing, not to mention her little sister. Most likely ending in her parents' divorce that will screw up her little sister's life even more. Her friends and the boy who had an undying love for her since the third grade probably aren't going to be quite the same after said event either; especially since the suicidal girl can easily get blamed for Sam's death and I'm sure that will result in Lindsay only bullying her even more. But that's okay because she had to die in order for a suicidal girl to realize not to suicide. A death that didn't even come across as a real sacrifice, but more like an accident. Sam didn't even push the girl out of the way, they both just stupidly ran in the road and Sam was dumb enough to stand in place to see the truck hit her. Plus, a girl with suicidal depression I doubt is going to be cured at the drop of a hat like this movie seems to suggest.It also doesn't make any sense that Sam is, for some reason, being punished to relive the same day again and again when Lindsay is really at fault for everything that happens. If anyone needs to learn the lesson to not be a terrible human being and not to bully defenseless people it's Lindsay, not Sam. Sam at worst is a girl that is just a bit on the wrong track at the moment, but more than likely once she goes to college and inevitably distances herself from Lindsay she'll probably be a morally decent person. Sam doesn't need to be taught a lesson that ends up with her dying unjustly. Lindsay on the other hand is a monster and it would totally make sense for, I guess God, to make her learn this lesson. Instead I guess God said, ""B*tches will be b*tches, but that Sam girl who has potential...yeah, she gotta go. Kill her."" What? Oh, sorry, I'm confusing God for the writer. Seriously, it makes no sense and is just another idiotic thing about this movie.There's a lot of other things wrong with this movie such as the characters consisting of a lot of unlikable jerks, narration that is complete and utter teeny bopper pretentious poetic garbage, nothing feels at stake and the premise of the girl reliving the same day several times over is stale. This premise has been done before and done way better with other films that actually take advantage of the possibilities of the idea while this movie does practically zilch with it. The most it plays with the concept of a teen girl reliving the same day forever and gets ""crazy"" with it is that at one point she wears her makeup a little heavier than normal, acts like a bitch to everyone, and wears somewhat inappropriate school attire...gee. The excitement from that sentence alone. I mean come on, it's a teenager that realizes she can do anything she wants without any consequence. I'm not saying that she should have gone full ""Groundhog Day"" and drove a truck into an oncoming train, but at least do something with that. Anything! Have her make out with everyone at school, flip off the teachers, set a classroom on fire, pants the nerdy kids, pull a freaking fire alarm, take a shit on her desk...SOMETHING!

In the beginning, it might look like another boring teenage film with these American chicks being mean and living careless life. But that's just the beginning. Actually the film starts this way because it wants to show the development of the main character. You probably know the main plot of the story already so I'm not going to put it down here. All I want to say is that when the same day keeps on repeating itself, it leaves the main character, and the viewers of the film, a few questions to ponder. Why this day keeps coming back? What are the things that the girl hasn't done right? The viewers will take on the journey of discovery with her.The overall atmosphere of the film might feel like an average teenage film. I think it has to be that way because focuses on the life of this one normal teenage girl. And I think it makes the film attractive for teenagers. It's a good film for them to watch so some of them might become aware before they are totally consumed by the influence of this corrupted, mean and fake society. The performance of the main character and of the cast as a whole, the lighting, the cinematography...all are pleasurable to watch. I was drawn into the film and felt entertained. At the same time, I could see that there is a deeper message about life that the filmmaker want to deliver. I suggest that you keep looking for message on being true and real to oneself without trying to please everyone, yet without destroying or hurting anyone.

After dying from a car accident, Sam wakes up reliving the same day over and over. Now the movie seems boring and pointless, however the movie had heart and passion. This movie had me in tears and made me wonder what makes me a good person? What are some things I need to work on? How can I show love towards this person or that person? Before I Fall reminds us that we only have one life and what we choose to do within that small time we have on this Earth is up to us. I highly recommend the movie to anyone out there old or young. The movie has changed my life and the way I look at myself. This film will have you in tears.""Maybe for you there's a tomorrow. Maybe for you, there's 1,000 or 3,000, or 10... So much time, you can bathe in it. So much time, you can waste it. But for some of us, there's only today, and what you do today matters - in the moment, and maybe into infinity...

76,yada2121,I disagree! It's not just for the under 25 crowd.,9,1 March 2019,"I love a story that hides its true meaning until the very end. That special premise that is not apparent at all until the very last scene. This is a wonderful fantasy story about a person who is lost until someone else saves them. And, it's not the one person you might think is lost. This is a story that is ageless and timeless. A story that is relevant no matter how old you are. To me, this one is a combination of Groundhog Day and the Time Traveler's Wife. It is about empathy and love and whether a person is a good person. I would strongly argue that most of the under 25 set would not understand the meaning of this movie. Because they haven't lived enough yet.

77,paulmcuomo,"A fairly strong YA movie, with all of the genre's flaws",6,5 November 2017,"OK, I just want to point out quite early on that I am not the intended audience for this movie. That being said, if you see a few of my other reviews on this site that are lower than this, you can probably guess that my approval of this movie is still worth something.By far the two best parts of this movie are it's direction and it's cinematography. The director, Ry Russo-Young has directed three Indie films (inc. this one), and I really hope she gets more work in the future on grander projects, as she really bring an expansiveness to the world that makes it feel so sharp and so haunting, particularly at the end during Sam's chasing Juliet through the forest, and she works so well with Michael Fimognari to make this look like a movie more expensive than its budget - hell, I would say this is better looking than most Hollywood blockbusters you see advertised nowadays.Elsewhere, there is a strong cast, where by far the biggest standout is Zoey Deutch as Sam. The thing about Sam is that her journey isn't new in any sense of the word - the whole Groundhog Day type device of repeating the same day over and over is not new, and neither is the Mean Girl to good person journey either - and Deutch also has to command the screen for a lot of the movie as she's in every sense. And what she does bring is a genuine believability in the moment, so that when she's being cruel in the first 30 minutes, you believe it, and when she's had enough and lashes out, you believe it, when she lives her last day as enlightened as could be, you believe it, and when she sacrifices herself for the good of another for entirely selfless reasons, you believe it. It's a fantastic performance that will be a catalyst for greater things.The rest of the cast, however, is sketchy, but to be fair, a lot of them are restricted by the dialogue which is often intentionally awkward. In particular, Halston Sage as Lindsay is the leader of the Mean Girls group that Sam is part of, and she is kind of written as unrepentantly mean and cruel, and even her past story is revealed you gain no sympathy or dimension for her, and it seems weird that anyone would hang out with her, even her friends seem scared of her. Then you have performers in smaller roles such as Liv Hewson as Anna, a gay girl that Sam and her friends bully for that reason (again, not likable at all) who is brilliant in her small role. Then you have Logan Miller as Sam's awkward love interest who has a lot of charm about him and is likable, funny, and rare enough in this movie, relatable. The main obstacle for lack of a better description is Juliet played by Elena Kampouris, and she really isn't on the standard. Not only is she painted in these really overly broad brush strokes, but she also doesn't have enough screen time to do anything about it; on a further point, she also doesn't deliver in the principle opening scene where she attacks Sam and her friends at the party, where comes across very false angry and weird. It would be OK if she was like Anna, where she is a side character not integral to the main story, but since the main story is about preventing Juliet's suicide, it's all the more noticeable.Other elements are as expected for YA movies: the soundtrack is full of pop anthems that are a little distracting and distancing, the dialogue is a little cringy although by design (but should this really be, outside of a comedy), and the ending isn't quite as emotional as I was expecting, although still handled well by direction.HOWEVER, bare this in mind, this movie is still a solid viewing experience and is one of the better YA movies. Not sure if it's a second viewing type film, but that's just me. If you like YA, give this a shot.",Before I Fall
78,cthetrancedone,Unique & Beautiful,10,30 October 2019,"I rarely give movies 10 star ratings.
Excellent throughout with an amazing twist of an ending.
You can't really create another Groundhog Day without actually copying it so this movie does it differently by putting it's own stamp on waking up to the same day by quickening the pace.
Don't let the first 15 minutes put you off into thinking this is just another teen movie, from here it quickly turns into serious stuff.
Great soundtrack and excellent acting.
The ending is superb giving you that real feel-good factor as the credits roll to a previous song from the movie which is always a touching thing to do as it allows you to reflect what you have just experienced.
Unique and beautiful.",Before I Fall
79,maurodc,It got better by the second half but it still doesn't make it good.,4,29 July 2017,"I waited months to see this movie because the trailer really promised an excellent and ingenious movie and I took my seat today expecting that. But by 5 minutes of the movie, I started worrying.I was worried because of how the moments of stupidity of the main character and her friends were way too long. Literally it took probably 30 minutes of the movie to really get to the point of the story. I understand that it is an important point of the story that had to be shown, so we get to understand how it all began, but still it was much longer and stressful (in the bad sense) than how it had to be.And it wasn't only the first 30 minutes, it was almost the entire movie. Because, when the main character apparently will change the things for good at last, she doesn't. And that makes that a great part of the movie isn't worthwhile at all, because it appears as if what happened a few moments before in the movie was for nothing. Another thing that made more painful the experience was the script. It wastes lots of pages in unfunny jokes, and it is very unbalanced because when the movie is going well, it falls down and it is a bad movie again. And that makes the few good things of the movie to be obscured by the bad ones.Overall, I most admit that it gets better at the end leaving a very important lesson to all, especially to teens. But anyway, there are better films that show the very same lesson in a more honest and better way and as I stayed at the title, it still doesn't make it a good movie at all.

81,Kareneo,Really good quality masquerading as cookie-cutter.,10,15 May 2017,"Yes, it is fair to say this is well-trodden ground. It really is Mean Girls meets Groundhog day, and it is true that it is full of standard mean girls and teen-jocks vs nerd-geek stereotypes, but this film manages to transcend its standard-issue roots with a really well-written script, perfect casting and faultless performances. I must admit to some trepidation in the opening scenes, but am so glad to have hung in there. A film opening with a wistful teenage girl voice-over doesn't usually bode well, and you could be forgiven for assuming we are in for a bunch of teenage angst or some godawful Twilight kind of 'relationships' -- but before long, when the Story Proper kicks into gear, you are taken on a ride towards increasingly realistic dialogue and scenarios that are familiar to our own real-life experiences (can anyone remember the parties they went to between ages 16 and 25? I can!) Ultimately there is just so much tenderness in this movie. The 10 stars I gave it is probably a little high, probably 9 is more accurate, but I love that it asks the Big Questions about us and about life. I was very moved by the ending.",Before I Fall
82,orlando-somera,"This film is much better than advertised, IMHO",9,1 April 2017,"Groundhog Day was played for laughs thereby selling the potential of this concept short. And though this more youthful and feminine take doesn't quite wring everything out of it, it goes much farther than the original, and that's really good to see.Most critics point out the promise of the lead, Zoey Deutch, who is good, but for me the real star is the story and its execution. There are group scenes in this film that are incredibly natural, as if these actors were actually friends. The gabby girlfriend thing is a bit much for guys, but it moves on pretty quickly. And there's also the performance of the main baddie, Halston Sage, who manages to conjure up every snooty clique queen you've ever known.All in all, an entertaining time at the movies showing a lot of promise for its young director, Ry Russo-Young.",Before I Fall

84,westfield-john,Fragments of Life,7,19 May 2017,"Finally I did take notice of Zoey Deutch, but she was hard to discover. Certainly she reminds me of Lea, but well, that's the story of the tree and the apples. Not this afar from what ""Before I fall"" is about. Zoey stop playing this Life simulator, I thought to myself, and was surprised by the outcome. You see one movie, and find so many fragments of other movies in it, you have seen awhile ago or so. Sometimes this seems intentional, sometimes not. But for this movie, it did work out. Let's say ""Before I fall"" is technically really professional, from tip to toe, music is brilliant, setting fits. Well done. The young ensemble didn't deliver any ground braking performance, but well above the average, and definitely respectable. Now, well here is the culprit. Fictions like this movie tell something which fits really well into young lives circumstances. Impulsive, emotionally driven, yearning for life, the story is the opposite. I felt always such a darkness through this movie. Like there was something bad to happen. And this was not due my supernatural precognition powers, but anticipation. Darn it, the actors did act like this, once the goal was set, the ambiance didn't change. As result, I did start asking myself, why is that. I did eat this like breadcrumbs, and well, the other stuff in the movie lost its magic. That shouldn't have been. Its like they couldn't let go how this movie would end. The impact of ""Before I fall"" would have been much better, if this would have not been so imminent. More character work, more details, more emphasis. Thats what would have made this movie wonderful or outstanding. Not only as story, but in acting and performance, heartfelt. It is like a firm tree with only half a dozen branches. 7/10",Before I Fall
85,MaxHaydon1994,Before I Fall,7,18 July 2017,"I'll start my review of 'Before I fall' the same way I'm sure many people will. By addressing the fact this film is clearly a rip off, some would say Groundhog Day for the next generation.However... once I'd finally let the idea of a comedy classic being ripped off settle in my stomach. The film became more appealing in it's concept.The difference between this film and Groundhog day is the inevitability of death. It's a much darker take on the repeating day. As the title would suggest Samantha (played by Zoey Deutch) tries to work out the events that lead to her death. Stuck in limbo between life and death she begins to learn more and more about her family and friends despite living the same day over and over.If anything I'm pleasantly surprised with this film.

86,elliest_5,I'm too old for this,3,2 August 2017,"First of all let me say I didn't pick this film at random, I really am a sucker for this kind of plot device (i.e. Groundhog Day or more generally the 'change one thing in a chain of events and see how they turn out' premise). The problem is I've seen many good films that have used this in clever ways (Run Lola Run) or even average quality films that have at least managed to keep the suspense going (Butterfly Effect). I've even enjoyed a recent teenagery version of this in game format (""Life is Strange"") which I think is the main reason why I thought I'd give this one a go.Well, it is dull and predictable, not even trying to be subtle (the moral of the story is literally printed in big bold letters on a poster that the camera zooms on around 10 times throughout the film). The acting is meh, cinematography good but uninspired. I think it is exclusively aimed at a teenage audience that hasn't yet been exposed to better movies of this kind. I also can't imagine who else would like the godawful music score (OK, sorry teens, I admit this may be me getting old).Bottom line: not suitable for over 25s.And a note regarding films on Netflix (that we don't hear about anywhere else): they suck more often than not.",Before I Fall

Doubly surprised and grinning like mad as our girls are busting out to some Grimes (Genesis) in a right proper open.Essentially Groundhogs Day swapped for VDay, albeit less comedic and more dramatic/dark. In ways, this feels like a sort of sister-piece to Donnie Darko, switching both the gender and holiday points of view/focus (Halloween-centric to VDay-centric). Having actively avoided S.

90,writeguyr,Pretty Little Bitches,3,4 July 2017,"SPOILER WARNING!!! What happens when you put four little bitches together in a High School setting? Yeah! Like a dozen people already wrote in their reviews about this film. ""Mean Girls."" Here we have Samantha (Zooey Deutch) and her mean gal buddy Lindsey (Halston Sage) and their two loyal minion follower gal pals. The high school girls are the terror of the high school hallways. As all other students seem to be in awe and envy of them. These four girls have the hippest clothes the best looking boyfriends. They rule! We watch their silly antics and pranks on each other and other students, especially against Lindsay's former best friend Juliet (Elena Kampouris) a raga muffin teen who resembles a New York city bag lady. Lindsay relishes with glee every opportunity to hurl nasty insults at her former best friend.Somehow Samantha wakes up every morning to relive the exact same day. And we have to witness repeatedly all the silliness and nastiness the mean girls have to dish out. Yes yes many other reviewers have noticed and coined ""Before I Fall"" ""Mean Girls"" meets ""Ground Hog Day"" It is so blatantly obvious that the material from these two previous films were used, borrowed, stolen. Screenwriter for this film Maria Maggenti and novelist Lauren Oliver have shamefully taken large chunks from the two films mentioned and tried to make a dramatic film. It didn't work. The two original films worked for they were comedies with heart and soul. Here with ""Before I Fall"" there is just a constant flow of meanness, with only slight glimpses of any heart.I really like Zooey Deutch as an actress, she is very talented. I wish she and her fellow actors had better script material to work with. Samantha as she relives her day over and over again attempts to break similar happenings by changing a few things in each day. In one repeat day scene Samantha wearing high fashion black and extra dark make-up. She looks more mature and in the SUV scene she releases her frustration upon her three mean girl pals by telling the truth, how she really feels about them. Samantha's wrath especially aimed against top honcho mean girl Lindsay, telling her she is a mean selfish egocentric bitch. BRAVO Samantha! This is the scene in this film that should have been a positive turning point.Now one would think logically that Samantha had learned something be reliving the day over repeatedly. That she had grown and grownup. Yet NO! The writer of this screenplay Maria Maggenti places Samantha back in the SUV the following repeat day having Samantha acting silly with her mean gal pals. That is what they call out of character and totally illogical! Another example of out of character. Is the slumber party sleepover scene. In this scene Samantha knowing of bad things to happen at a big high school party, asks Lindsay and her two minion friends to join her in a slumber party, and for her friends not to attend the big party. So the three forgo the big party and join Samantha's slumber sleep over. NO WAY!! Lindsay as Samantha told her off is a selfish, egotistic brat!! No way Lindsay would not attend the big party. The writer here blew this scene, Lindsay is written completely out of character! Now all of this repetition has some kind of darker meaning. In another repeat day, Juliet confronts Lindsay at the big party, after a screaming altercation between the two. Juliet dashes from the party and is later killed. This scene is repeated several times with the same tragic result. Meanwhile Samantha finally begins to lose her mean girl ways, and starts treating her family with more caring love. A nerd boy that was kind to her, but she not to him, she begins to feel for him, choosing him over her one time all popular high school handsome hunk boyfriend. Yet the most important part of her repetitive puzzle , she doesn't get! Save Juliet from killing herself. She could have done this at the many relived high school scenes. In the cafeteria, by getting up from her elite mean girl table, instead of asking Lindsay ""Why she is so mean to Juliet?"" Hey Lindsay is the ultimate mean girl, That's why! Samantha could have gone over and sat with Juliet, tell her she'll give her some fashionable clothing so Juliet does not have look like an old bag lady and be friends with Juliet.This would have taken courage on Samantha's part. Yet the writer picked the illogical course of action. As we see Samantha dashing after Juliet in a desperate last second effort trying to keep Juliet from running in front of highway traffic. This scene is repeated many times with the finale Samantha pushing Juliet out of the way of a truck, giving her life to save Juliet. A redundant illogical ending. The element of high school bullying is not handled well in this film. It leads to Juliet's near suicide and Samantha's death. Unfortunately, most teen girls watching this film will envy and want to copy the cool mean girl Lindsay. Unfortunately there are probably many Lindsays in High Schools all over America, who prey on girls like Juliet.Part of the fear of everyday life is not knowing what is going to happen. Yet Samantha knows the future she can change and alter it any way she wants to. So why would she want end her life, when she can share her new kinder side with her family after discarding the mean girl within herself? One last observation, when Samantha is in bed she wears a really old torn tattered T-shirt that even Juliet would have been embarrassed to wear. Why would a teen who is so fashion conscious wear a torn trashy t shirt? Makes no sense at all!! Out of character again!",Before I Fall

92,mrocco-1,Haunting,10,17 July 2017,"This is one of those 'God I miss the forums' moments. I wish I had someone to talk to about this movie, even while putting up with the trolls lol. THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERSThis is a variation of the Groundhog Day/Butterfly effect that has been done Ad nauseum in books and movies where our main character relives the same day. As expected, the point of the story is that their actions in that day evolve to the point where the lessons are learned and the day finally ends. This movie is no different. I'm haunted by this movie because of a particular lesson learned, and it's not the main one that finally ends her loop. Sam is our main character caught in the time loop. She is part of a foursome of girls that are the popular girls and sometimes the mean girls. Their leader is Lindsay (Linds) who is the meanest of all with some deep rooted insecurities. As Sam relives her day she discovers more insight into her own life and the flaws of her and her friends. The two girls that receive the bulk of the mean girl routine become known to her and she realizes she is just following Lindsay like a puppet, not even knowing why they are mean to these girls. On one of her days journey, she lashes out at her friends in anger and disgust, particularly her bestie Lindsay. She sees Lindsay for who she is and she doesn't like it. For most people that would be the end of that. We all have those friends that we turn on when we realize their flaws and decide to remove them from our lives. Let's face it, love is usually conditional. The part of the movie that REALLY got me and I can't stop thinking about is the full circle point where she recognizes the motivation behind Lindsay's 'meanness' and shows her total compassion and love. She embraces this meanest girl of all and instead of rejection and hate she provides her with complete recognition and acceptance. This may seem like no big deal to most, but to me it stuck out like a sore thumb. Usually in movies and books the character like Lindsay end with that character getting his or her comeuppance. Instead this movie preaches love and understanding of all people.This is the part I can't stop thinking about. This is the kind of love and compassion that I would venture to say most of us want to think we posses, but really don't when it's too close to home. I found that very inspiring and it has me thinking of various people I've rejected in my life based on my judgment of them without any compassion. Any movie that makes me think as much as this one has deserves a 10.",Before I Fall
