0,SnoopyStyle,still don't like the brat,6,31 May 2020,"Geppetto (Roberto Benigni) is a struggling woodworker. After a traveling caravan arrives in town with puppets, he gets a magical piece of wood and carves Pinocchio who comes to life. It's an adaptation of the classic Italian children's novel. It has a magical darkness and a reality to the surreal world. The problem is that I've never liked Pinocchio. He's an idiot and an annoying brat. He never does what Geppetto wants. He keeps getting tricked by the most obvious scams. He's an infuriating character. I appreciate the style and the faithfulness of this adaptation. I still don't like Pinocchio. I kept wondering if a movie about Geppetto would be more compelling. I'm not fully sold with Benigni's comedic take on Geppetto but I would have liked to give it a try for the whole movie. Overall, this is an interesting exercise but I'm not fully engaged.",Pinocchio
1,kosmasp,(Wooden) state of mind,5,18 March 2020,"First of all, there is no doubt that this looks stunning. The effects are great, the cinematography is really good. And Roberto might come off annoying at the beginning when he keeps ""begging"" for money/work, but I would call that loveable.If you see it otherwise, it won't become a decline later on, but you still won't find too many good things in the story ahead (again, visuals and music aside). Suspending your disbelief is one thing and quite necessary here. Something works fine at first but when the incoherent storytelling, that seems quite aimless or without a clear goal, throws cliches at you and is rather nasty without remorse, it really becomes a question of how much are you willing to take.Now a wooden character does not have to have certain feelings necessarily and it's always nice to see a journey. The issue here is that while Pinocchio is mean and evil one minute, he sacrifices himself the next. This flip flopping may feel like unwarranted critique to some, but to others (especially if we're talking grown ups) will have problems to digest these things.If you are watching this with kids or can be forgiving enough to oversee all these flaws and more, you will be able to enjoy it's great looking adventure. Just be aware of what is happening and what is not. And don't look for this to make much sense. It's episodic at best",Pinocchio
2,jboothmillard,Pinocchio,5,21 September 2020,"I had seen the 1940 Disney animated classic, the 1996 Martin Landau/Jim Henson Creature Workshop version, and the awful 2002 Italian version directed by and starring Roberto Benigni. It was odd to see Benigni starring in another version of the story by Carlo Collodi, I was intrigued to see this Italian movie, after seeing positive reviews, directed by Matteo Garrone (Gomorrah). Basically, Geppetto (Roberto Benigni) is a poor carpenter, who decides to make his own wooden puppet, after seeing a touring puppet theatre run by Mangiafuoco (Gigi Proietti). His friend and colleague Mister Cherry (Paolo Graziosi) is frightened by a living log, he gives it to Geppetto when he comes asking for a piece of wood. Geppetto begins to build the puppet, and names it ""Pinocchio"". During the process, Geppetto realises that Pinocchio (Federico Ielapi) is alive, and is overjoyed to declare him as his son. Given a body, Pinocchio starts running outside and Geppetto must go looking for him. When Pinocchio returns home, a hundred-year-old Talking Cricket (Davide Marotta) tries to help him, giving him advice, but the puppet ignores and tries to get rid of him. Later, Geppetto returns home and finds Pinocchio with his feet burned, having fallen asleep by the fireplace. After rebuilding Pinocchio's feet, Geppetto wants his ""son"" educated, so sells his jacket to buy a schoolbook. Pinocchio sets off for his first day of school, but is diverted when he sees the puppet theatre, and he sells his book to buy a ticket. In the theatre, the other puppets see Pinocchio in the audience and call him up on stage, believing him to be their new brother. Furious that his production was interruted, the puppeteer Mangiafuoco kidnaps Pinocchio, locking him up with the other puppets, and leaves the town. At night, Mangiafuoco plans to use Pinocchio as firewood to cook his dinner. Pinocchio begs the puppeteer to release him to return home to his father. Sneezing with emotion, Mangiafuoco releases him, choosing to burn another puppet in his place. But Pinocchio does not accept that someone should pay for his mistake and accepts his punishment. Touched by Pinocchio's action, Mangiafuoco lets him go, and out of pity, gives him five gold coins to give to Geppetto. Whilst returning home, Pinocchio meets a Fox (Massimo Ceccherini) and a Cat (Rocco Papaleo), both pretending to be disabled. Wanting the gold coins, they suggest Pinocchio should bury them in the ""Field of Miracles"", saying they will sprout a tree full of money. Enticed by the idea of becoming rich, Pinocchio follows them to the field, which is in the Land of Barn Owl. The three of them stop for food at a tavern, paid for by Pinocchio. After agreeing to resume the journey at midnight, the Cat and the Fox leaving the puppet, claiming they have a sick relative. Pinocchio continues alone. Ignoring the warnings of the Talking Cricket, Pinocchio ventures into the woods and encounter a two hooded assassin (the Cat and the Fox in disguise). Pinocchio hides the remaining four coins in his mouth and tries to run away but is caught and hung from a tree. He is rescued by a young blue-haired fairy (Alida Baldari Calabria), who lives nearby. She brings him to her home, where he is visited by Doctor Owl (Gianfranco Gallo), Doctor Crow (Massimiliano Gallo), and the Talking Cricket. Pinocchio refuses to take medicine until he is scared into doing so at the prospect of dying and being put in a coffin, carried away by a group of undertaker rabbits. Once healed, Pinocchio is asked why he was in the forest and not in school or at home. Embarrassed, he lies, but his nose grows bigger and bigger with each lie he tells, until the Fairy is forced to summon a flock of woodpeckers to shorten his nose. Eventually the Fairy sends Pinocchio off to be reunited with Geppetto. However, on his way home, Pinocchio again meets the Fox and the Cat. They again convince him to go to the Field of Miracles. Upon arriving at the field, Pinocchio plants the coins and goes to get some water. In the meantime, the Fox and the Cat steal the coins and disappear. Discovering the theft, Pinocchio goes to the local court to report it to the Judge Gorilla (Teco Celio). As the theft occurred in Barn Owl, he is given a life sentence, but he is exonerated after confessing to committing another crime, making him guilty, and he is released. Pinocchio returns home, but the neighbours tell him that Geppetto left to go looking for him and went overseas in North America, still thinking that he is in the hands of Mangiafuoco. Pinocchio reaches the sea and dives in to find Geppetto but is unsuccessful and washed up on the Island of the Busy Bees. Fortunately, Pinocchio is saved by the Blue Fairy, now an adult (Marine Vacth). Pinocchio expresses his wish to become an adult as well, and the Fairy promises to turn him into a real boy if he is good. Pinocchio goes to school and studies hard to fulfil his dream of becoming a real boy. But he befriends Candlewick (Alessio Di Domenicantonio), a naughty and disobedient boy, who invites him to his party, and to come along with him to Toyland, a place where children can play all day and do whatever they want without grownups. Initially undecided, Pinocchio boards the coach to Toyland, where the many children, mostly little boys, enjoy themselves. But then they discover that they have all been magically transformed into donkeys, and the Coachman (Nino Scardina) sells the kid-donkeys. Pinocchio is sold to a circus where he is forced to perform acrobatics. During a performance, Pinocchio sees the Fairy in the audience, he trips and cripples himself. The Director of the Circus (Massimiliano Gallo) decides to drown him in the sea and then use his skin. While in the water, the Fairy summons many fishes to nibble away Pinocchio's donkey skin, and he returns to normal. Pinocchio swims away and continues his search for the father, until he is swallowed by the Terrible Dogfish, a gigantic and ravenous sea monster. Inside the creature, Pinocchio encounters a talking Tuna (Maurizio Lombardi) and, to his great joy, he also finds his father. The Dogfish suffers asthma, forcing it to sleep with its mouth open, so Geppetto and Pinocchio take advantage and from his mouth, along with the Tuna. Pinocchio and Geppetto find an abandoned country house to rest. Pinocchio works to heal his father, who has become sick. He again encounters the Fox and the Cat, but he ignores their apologies and any further cons. Pinocchio continues to work and study hard until Geppetto recovers. Later, the Fairy visits him at the farm and grants his wish. Pinocchio returns home to Geppetto and shows him that he has become a real boy. Also starring Maria Pia Timo as the Snail, and Enzo Vetrano as the Teacher. Benigni is likeable as the carpenter who wants a good son, and young Ielapi gives a good performance as the vulnerable puppet made of pine. This is definitely one of the strangest versions of the story I have seen, apparently one of the closest to the source material, which may explain the characters I had not seen before, e.g. Talking snails and a gorilla judge. Most of the plot is the same as I have seen before, and it has a good mix of special effects makeup and only a little CGI, overall it is a fairly good fantasy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up & Hair. Worth watching, in my opinion!",Pinocchio
3,BandSAboutMovies,Well done,6,2 March 2021,"If you saw this and thought, ""Didn't Academy Award winner Roberto Benigni already make a Pinocchio movie back in 2002?*"" Well, yes, you would be correct. That version, written, directed and starring Benigni was nominated for six Razzies, including Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actor (Benigni, who was dubbed by Breckin Meyer, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Screen Couple (Benigni and his wife Nicoletta Braschi, who played the Blue Fairy).Seventeen years later, Benigni is in another adaption of Carlo Collodi's book The Adventures of Pinocchio, but now he's playing the wooden boy's father Geppetto. Is the second time the charm for this timeless tale?When a magical piece of wood falls into his hands, Geppetto does what he does best, carves it. What emerges is his greatest creation, Pinocchio, a puppet wondrously bestowed with life. However, Pinocchio dreams of becoming a real boy and that quest takes him into a series of misadventures with a fox and a cat, as well as a hundred-year-old cricket that continually attempts to be the conscience that our hero needs.This film looks gorgeous, as it has a practical effects heart instead of trying to be a CGI film. It looks darker and scarier than the Disney approach that we know in this country, but don't let that put you off. There's something great here.That said, it's still pretty dark in places. After several adaptations to make the story more family-friendly, director Matteo Garrone took this movie back to its origins, the grim atmosphere and satirical tone of Collodi's original novel. Garrone claimed that ""much of the criticisms of the film's violent content came from adults, while children in the test audience were quite relaxed about that aspect.""Garrone is known for films like Dogman and Gomorrah, which are more adult fare. This is his first film that families can watch. He also believed in the project so much that he put his own money into the dubbing, using Italian actors who would know the emotions and would be able to convey it to a worldwide audience.*Rocco Papaleo (who plays the Cat) was the voice of Mangiafoco in the 2012 animated adaption.",Pinocchio
4,CinemaSerf,My nose would grow if I said this was good....,6,17 August 2020,"The first thing to say about this is that it is not really a kids movie, so if you are planning on taking the bairns to watch this expecting some sort of Disney-esque entertainment, then think again. Indeed if my experience today is anything to go by, most of the youngsters at the screening were pretty bored after the first half an hour. Which is a shame, because that is the best bit! Roberto Benigni is the poverty stricken carpenter ""Geppetto"" (who bears a striking resemblance to Jack Albertson). He yearns for a child, and so when he is gifted an enchanted log he creates a puppet that comes to life! A more selfish, thoughtless creature never drew breath and that is probably why Collodi's ""Pinocchio"" story has less of the romantic resonance of other contemporary stories. He isn't a very nice, considerate child - in fact he is a bit of a disobedient brat! If you have read the story, then you know that in advance, so it's no surprise that the plot follows that narrative as he runs away with the puppet show, falls in with some dodgy company and generally causes no end of grief to his poor old father. What is a surprise is the complete lack of flair and style in this production. Sure, the live-action effects are top notch but when are they not, these days? The characterisations of the talking animals - especially the monkey judge and the weary tuna fish are totally charm free and although I thought Federico Ielapi was quite good in the title role, the whole thing just felt a bit flat with little humour or magnetism - even amongst the mischievous. In days when kids are watching super-sophisticated animations, the danger is that these wonderful stories with a gently moral message will just get subsumed into a world full of mid-Atlantic accents and shouty ballads. Sadly, this won't really help arrest that tide.",Pinocchio
5,ferguson-6,The nose grows once,6,23 February 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Part 'Frankenstein' and part parable for parenting is how I've always thought of the story of Pinocchio. In this latest version, director and co-writer (with Massimo Ceccherini) Matteo Garrone adds a splash ""Alice in Wonderland"" to Carlo Callodi's 1883 novel, ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"". The result is a grim, not-kid-friendly live-action presentation that's a bit uneven, yet still engaging.Oscar winner Roberto Benigni (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, 1997) is wood-carver Geppetto, a poverty-stricken man who works magic with a chisel, but is never quite sure where his next meal will come from. When the traveling Grand Puppet Theater hits town, Geppetto dreams of creating a beautiful puppet and traversing the globe to show it off. A fellow wood worker gifts him with the enchanted piece of wood from which Pinocchio is born. When he discovers the puppet can talk, Geppetto is so proud of his new son that he shows him off around town and walks him to his first day of school.Of course we know that Pinocchio is a curious boy, and he immediately sneaks off to watch the puppet show. This sets off his many adventures, while simultaneously making Geppetto quite sad as he undertakes a search and rescue mission. Pinocchio crosses paths with the kinda creepy Talking Cricket (Davide Marotta), the fire-eating Mangiafuoco (Gigi Proeitti), a couple of tricksters in Cat (Rocco Papaleo) and Fox (co-writer Ceccherini), a confused gorilla judge (Teco Celio), and a friendly, but slimy snail (Maria Pia Timo) who lives with the Fata Turchina/Blue Fairy (played young by Alida Baldari Calabria, and older by well-known French actress Marine Vacth).The enticement of playing all day and having no responsibilities leads Pinocchio to accept an invitation to Toyland, although the train of donkeys pulling the wagon load of kids is our tipoff to what's about to go down. Pinocchio's subsequent swim in the ocean and encounter with the sea monster are handled well visually, and the reunion with Geppetto is quite pleasant. You should know that the iconic Pinocchio nose that grows upon telling lies is limited to a single scene, albeit a memorable one.Benigni was the writer-director-star of the critically-panned 2002 PINOCCHIO, which also failed at the box office. He's much better suited to the role of Geppetto and does a nice job of capturing the essence of the character. Federico Ielapi handles the role of Pinocchio quite well, and the ""wooden"" effects of his face are quite impressive. The story is a metaphor for the struggles and challenges of life, and the life lessons are easy to discern ... for instance, there is no 'field of miracles', regardless of what Cat and Fox promise. Nicolai Bruel's cinematography is at times visually stunning as we make our way through the countryside of Italy. It's just that director Garrone (two excellent films: TALE OF TALES 2015, and GOMORRAH 2008) chooses to emphasize the bleakness, and it's important to note that this is far-removed from the 1940 Disney animated classic. Most will struggle to find an emotional connection, though the look of the film and life lessons are top notch. Guillermo del Toro has a stop-action animation version currently in production and it's not surprisingly rumored to be even darker than this one.
After a long delay, the film gets a digital release on February 23, 2021",Pinocchio
6,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Pinocchio (2019) 7.5/10,8,17 June 2020,"""What simply works here is the reification of a mythical realm that is inhabited by both humans and zoomorphic beings, from the first glimpse of Pinocchio, a young boy seems to be entirely enclosed by a wooden veneer, it is difficult to tell this vivid effect is generated by special makeup artifice or digital rendering in the post-production (the result is a synergy of both though), and the whole impression goes a bit uncanny when Pinocchio joins other human-size, string-attached puppets, grotesquery is on show but no malignancy is brewing underneath, the real menace and treachery is in the presence of Fox and Cat (Ceccherini, the co-scribe and Papaleo), epitomizing the vice of adulthood, plus a sideswipe about the injustice that deems innocence as a crime.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Pinocchio
7,dromasca,becoming a child like all the other,7,5 June 2020,"Pinocchio fascinates filmmakers. The first atru to bring to screen Carlo Collodi's novel took place in 1936, as an animated feature, in Italy, but the first to complete the project were Walt Disney and his colleagues in 1940. Another 20 films followed, animated or with actors. The 2019 version directed by Matteo Garrone is the most recent, being released at the end of 2019. Its international distribution was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The next remake is already in preparation. Until then, audiences around the world are waiting to watch the 2019 edition of 'Pinocchio' - a film with many qualities but which will certainly not be the ultimate big screens version of the story of carpenter Geppetto and of his wooden-made son.There are at least two possible readings of Pinocchio's story. The first is the moralistic reading that includes a few lessons that we would like to make sure as parents that they are well assimilated by our children. Attachment to parents, discipline, desire to learn, the need for tenderness - all these positive paternal values are transmitted through the elements of the fairy tale. I will call the second reading the transcendental one - it is about the desire of the animated piece of wood, carved in a talking doll by Geppetto, to become human, aspiring to the normality of a childhood like all children enjoy. Between the two feelings of Pinoccho the writer interposed the character of the fairy who appears in the key moments and who shows Pinocchio the road towards fulfilling the dream, a path that requires earning the discipline and the strength necessary to overcome all adversity. Good childhood lessons are eternal and apply at any age.Matteo Garrone's filmography combines courageous social films related to today's realities of Italy with the exploration of classic and fantastic literature created (also) for children. 'Pinocchio' obviously belongs to the second category, but what surprised me a little is the flatness of the approach. The film looks great visually. Technology-wise this recent 'Pinocchio' is an achievement. The make-up is masterful, the costumes are very appropriate, the sets combine with elegance historical accuracy with fantastic touches, because after all we are in a fairy tale. The camera allows itself from time to time angles that reminded me of the 'Wizard of Oz'. Roberto Benigni plays an excellent role in his second 'Pinocchio', after the first one, not very successful, in 2002 in which he had assumed both film direction and the titular role. Now he has advanced in age and was promoted to make a wonderfully disturbing Geppetto. Pinocchio is played by Federico Ielapi, an 8-9 year old boy, whose make-up left only his eyes to express the range of emotions of the wooden doll who dreams of becoming a child like all the other. However, the impressive production cannot completely cover the lack of emotion or daring that would have made this 'Pinocchio' a memorable film. Lasting two hours, the film risks getting its children audiences get tired and lose focus. The mature audiences will not find enough substance to justify the effort of watching beyond the duty to accompany children or grandchildren to the cinema theaters. This 'Pinocchio' is interesting in many ways but it could have been more. The next occasion will be the animated remake of the 1940 production which is now in preparation at the Disney Studios.",Pinocchio
8,westsideschl,"Yes, It's Not Disney",10,24 June 2021,"I didn't really know the history of this second most translated story (behind, obviously, The Bible), but it seems that most negative views come from those expecting this film's reality to be the Disney pollyannaish version (Notably most disturbed by a hanging scene.) Interestingly it seems this 1880s Italian tale of youthful misadventure, and disobedience was a metaphor on humanity.Acting, dialogue, sets, props, costumes & makeup all remarkably first class.Aside: I don't think kids should be shielded from some of the dishonesty & meanness portrayed, but used as a vehicle for discussion.",Pinocchio
9,ops-52535,ITS A BEAUTY,8,19 October 2020,"Put away your childhood story about pinocchio as a cartoon caracter, and climb inside the whales belly and do a asses kick and tell the story afterwards having a bunch of woodpeckers shorten your nose, to pain away the slithering lies youve told. its fun , its calm, its scary, and its brutal, but its the best story made by man at this side of the century, about the wooden string puppet without a string attached.the filmography and production design, along with a beautiful score makes this a pleasant one and a half hour of reminiscence about how nice it was when young. its not the pop-story that disney screwed together, no, this is the real narrative, made and spoken in italian. the actors are well reknown faces in italian film, which make this even more viewable. you might expect some visual effect to be made to create a wooden caracter, and yes there are, and you wont be disapointed.so hunk yourself , with you kids and grandkids but not the smallest ones due to some short but violent and pg-worthy sequences, in the sofa with your cheesedoodles and crisps, because this is time well worth spent. a recommend from the grumpy old man",Pinocchio

This is a live action Italian/French interpretation of the famous children's story that was written by Carlo Collodi in 1911. I don't know how much children will like it because it's a little different from the Disney version. It has all the famous cliches that you are probably familiar with, such as his nose growing whenever he tells a lie-it only happens once-being swallowed by a big fish, being turned into a donkey, etc. And this is not the first live action adaptation, either. Roberto Benigni was in a 2002 version where he played Pinocchio-maybe he is going to play the Blue Fairy in the next version, who knows? In this movie, Roberto plays Geppetto, the woodcarver that is given a magical piece of wood in which he carves Pinocchio out of-the film does not go into detail about how the piece of wood is enchanted. Federico plays Pinocchio, the come to life puppet that wants to be a real boy. He has several adventures where he runs into Marine and Rocco-one good and one bad-and gets turned into a donkey and eventually gets swallowed up by a whale. A lot of the characters Pinocchio runs into are animal hybrids-half animal half human-and have animal names. The effects are not bad and it is dubbed. If you want to see a version that is based more on the original book-instead of the Disney version-you might enjoy it.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes.

12,yusufpiskin,"""Che bella persona questo tonno.""",8,19 August 2020,"You probably think you know this story. It's been told on screen before, including a 1972 TV miniseries starring Vittorio de Sica as a judge, and is being revived again in stop-motion by Guillermo del Toro and as a live-action remake of the 1940 Disney classic by Robert Zemeckis. It's surprising that, given the tale's origins, there hasn't been a successful big-budget Italian adaptation until now. It's a shame, then, that Matteo Garrone's version will be overshadowed by English-language takes.Garrone and Massimo Ceccherini's screenplay sticks closely to Carlo Collodi's original story, published in 1883, which is even darker than the disturbing Disney version. Beyond donkey transformations and terrifying whales, the eponymous marionette himself is initially an unlikeable hero who runs away from his creator, Geppetto, as soon as he's given legs.Collodi's original ending had Pinocchio hung by the Fox and the Cat as a warning to naughty children, an event disturbingly staged in the film, although at the insistence of his editor Collodi revived the character for more stories about his path to redemption. Given the grizzly anthology of fables Garrone used in Tale of Tales, it's hardly surprising his take on Pinocchio errs more on the side of Collodi than Disney.Having directed a flopped 2002 version, for which his Pinocchio was bizarrely dubbed over in English by Seth Meyers, Roberto Benigni is better suited to an actor's life here as Geppetto. While we assume he is carving the magic puppet in the opening scene, he is instead freeing what few edible crumbs he can salvage from a rind of cheese.Unlike the bountiful business of Disney's toymaker, Garrone is unafraid to bring the adult grit of his urban dramas like Gomorrah or Dogman to this family-friendly sojourn. When a cricket shows up trying to serve as his conscience, Pinocchio lobs a mallet at his head before he can so much as give a little whistle. He's certainly got no strings.While the detailed prosthetics on Federico Ielapi make him almost too humanoid to be a puppet, it makes him easier to empathise with than the frightening wooden doll used in Steve Baron's 1996 The Adventures of Pinocchio. Given the film clocks in at just over two hours, it's a testament to Ielapi's infantile charm that our engagement is sustained. It feels like an extension of Garrone's own investment in the story - he claims to have drawn the first storyboard when he was six years old.Pinocchio is a celebration of a fantastical world seen through a child's eyes, smattered with boyish humour such as a squeaky-voiced professor trying to get a frog out of his pants. The result is a visual feast of candy-coloured circuses and breath-taking practical effects from talking tuna fish and bunny undertakers to a giant snail maid and a marionette show. Garrone makes every set piece feel like a dream come true.By the time the Fairy with Turquoise Hair (Marine Vacth) turns Pinocchio into a human boy, we've long since forgotten his early misbehaviour. It's a beautiful moment, a simple message of redemption that affirms the tale's timeless relevance. While its success outside Italy remains to be seen, del Toro and Zemeckis will have to pull a lot of strings to better Garrone.",Pinocchio
13,jadepietro,A Wooden-Headed Adaptation,6,14 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: Fine production values cannot hide the film's odd and creepy interpretation of the original folktale.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Let me begin at the outset to hereby state that I love, love, love Disney's 1940 classic animated film, Pinocchio. That said, this somber Italian fantasy film seems a radical re-telling that clings more closely to Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel but without the enchantment.Gone is the detailed hand-drawn images. Gone is the infectious music score. Gone is the sentiment story of growing up and wishing upon a star. Gone is the well-earned sense of wonder. The overall story is still recognizable to those who grew up with and know the Disney film. Leave your pre-conceived notions of this folktale behind. This version is definitely different. This Pinocchio is still the story of a puppet who becomes a boy, but the transformation from page to screen this go-round is more akin to a Frankenstein monster let loose in a wicked wicked world. Some moviegoers might ask themselves, ""Which becomes the lesser if two evils, the wooden-headed puppet or mankind?"" (And Pinocchio wins by a nose!)Yes, Geppetto (a surprisingly subdued Roberto Benigni) still yearns for a son, be he wooden or not. However, when Pinocchio (Federico Ielapi) appears, he is a full-fledged brat, a juvenile delinquent on a reign of terror. In the original cautionary tale, The Adventures of Pinocchio, our puppet is naive and selfish. As this film adaptation unfolds, Pinocchio begins his coming-of-age tale with a mean streak. He does encounter many obstacles on his series of misadventures, be they, greedy con men or cruel teachers. Yet, some of these incidents are presented more appealingly than others. The screenplay by writer / director Matteo Garrone and Massimo Ceccherini takes the original Collodi source too seriously and in doing so, this film adaptation completely loses its magic.One can see that there was much care and passion in the making of this lavish movie. Mr. Garrone directs this surreal story with style, although some of our anti-hero's detours go on far too long and the pacing seems lethargic and as bloated as its sea monster. Most of the movie's production values remain strong. The art direction and set design are lovely. Dario Marianelli's melancholy score has many haunting moments while it reinforces the film's more serious tone. The fine camerawork by Nicolai Brüel has a lyrical and naturalistic quality and the CGI is uniformly well done. Pinocchio's wooden complexion is extremely effective throughout the film, but the make-up design with others is inconsistent. A few characters, like the Cricket (far from the Jiminy of yore), the Cat, and the Fox are downright creepy and not fully realized which hinders the film's attempts at magic realism.The cast is uneven. Mr. Benigni is fine, but young Mr. Ielapi is not very convincing in the title role and eludes the charm factor. In his defense, the character, as written, has no redeeming virtues and remains unlikeable to the end. Rocco Papaleo and Massimo Ceccherrini as the villainess Cat and Fox duo are far too hammy in their roles, although Marine Vacth emits the right degree of innocence as the Fairy with Turquoise Hair (a.k.a. The Blue Fairy) that works quite well.Pinocchio (2020) is a very mixed blessing. More odd than endearing, the film is always diverting, even if it gets lost in its own Wonderland...without that needed scintilla of wonder. It's a curiouser and curiouser affair, indeed.

16,petra_ste,Fine adaptation of a classic,8,13 January 2020,"This is a largely faithful, visually neat adaptation of Collodi's classic of children's literature. Talented director Matteo Garrone (Il Racconto dei Racconti, Dogman, L'Imbalsamatore) keeps the darker side of his imagination at bay and correctly puts his visual talent in service of the story.Performances are solid; Roberto Benigni is much better as Geppetto - warm, paternal, lovably awkward - than he was as Pinocchio. Even the kids are fine, with Ielapi as the titular protagonist, the naive, stubborn but well-meaning Pinocchio, Baldari Calabria as the quietly mischievous young fairy and Di Domenicantonio as toxic friend Lucignolo.Special mention to the excellent make-up and costumes.7,5/10",Pinocchio

Actually to be brutally honest for adults unfortunately it is simply boring.I so desperately wanted this to be another great adaptation and whilst the cinematograohy was simply stunning this wasn't enough to keep interest.Such a shame!, I wanted to love this film but......Rating 4 out of 10",Pinocchio

My Rating 9/10
I'm trying to see as many Academy Award 2021 nominated films as I can before the awards ceremony on the 26th April.
So I was thrilled to receive my DVD copy of Italian Director and Screenplay Writer Matteo Garrone's live action feature Pinocchio today .
Pinocchio has been nominated for 2 Academy Award this year Best Achievement in Costume Design for Massimo Cantini Parrini and Best Achievement in Make Up and Hairstyling for Mark Coulier Dalia Colli and Francesco Pegoretti. I'm amazed this excellent Foreign Language Film isn't nominated for the new Category of Best International Feature.
This Italian version of Pinocchio (I'm glad I didn't get the English dubbed version) is magical and enchanting and quite dark in parts which is faithful to Carlo Collodi's original concept. I love the Walt Disney 1949 Classic Cartoon feature Of Pinocchio but if you think that represents the book faithfully think again.
There are of course most of the original characters in this fine new version of Pinocchio like Geppetto a Cricket a Fox and Cat and of course a fairy but this is a human fable with a great moral tale for all that if you divert off the path of honesty, kindness and responsibility you do so at your own peril.
Matter Garrone's fantasy film, co-written, directed and co-produced by Himself is a true labour of love for the character. He has based his version on the 1883 book The Adventures of Pinocchio by Italian author Carlo Collodi. The film stars child actor Federico Ielapi as Pinocchio who was 9 years old when filming began and must have been an incredibly patient little boy as Pinocchio's make up took 3 hours to apply.
The costumes and make up are fantastic ,especially the marionettes and other new characters like a whimsical snail a talkative tuna a parrot ,a hysterical magisterial ape and an exotic Coachman who delivers Pinocchio after rescuing him from a hangman's noose to The Fairy with Turquoise hair or La Fata dai Capelli Turchini The Blue Fairy.
Roberto Benigni as Geppetto, Academy Award 1999 Oscar winner is superb as the proud father of his puppet boy Pinocchio who comes to life and keeps getting into all sorts of scrapes and having to go searching for him across the ocean.
All the ensemble cast are wonderful Gigi Proietti as Mangiafuoco, Rocco Papaleo and Massimo Ceccherini as The Cat and the Fox, and Marine Vacth as the adult Fairy with Turquoise Hair. Gigi Proietti is also wonderful he plays the scary puppet master Mangiafuoci who locks up Pinocchio but eventually releases him to continue his adventure after Pinocchio melts his heart with a kiss.
This was final appearance before his death in November 2020, though he is set to make a posthumous appearance in the film Io so I Babbo Natalie.
After several adaptations that had made the story family-friendly, director Matteo Garrone wanted this movie to go back to the grim atmosphere and satirical tone of Carlo Collodi's original novel, complete with depictions of cruelty and extreme poverty. Garrone said that much of the criticisms of the film's violent content came from adults, while children in the test audience were quite relaxed about that aspect.There are 2 other upcoming versions of Pinocchio due out in the near future an upcoming live-action adaptation of the 1940 animated feature of the same name. The film was announced on April 8, 2015, and will premiere exclusively on Disney+.
I haven't really been impressed with any of Disney's live action attempts except The Lion King so can't see it improving on this great version.
The other version I am looking forward to is Guillermo del Toro's new animated fantasy feature filming at the moment with voice overs from Cate Blanchett Ewan McGregor as Cricket ,Tilda Swindon , Ron Perlman as Mangiafuoco and Christopher Waltz as The Fox. I'm sure Guillermo del Toro's version will be more original than Disney's we shall see but this Italian version is the best version I my opinion since Walt Disney introduced us to the wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy.",Pinocchio
22,Alexander_Blanchett,Missed opportunity.,5,23 February 2020,"Well, the film was technically done very well, especially considering it is an european production, (although some creatures looked like they were out of ""Angry Orange"") what the film definitely lacked though was Soul, and a huge Portion of that. It was really a waste of material and Money if you make your film look Pretty but Forget what movies are all About and that is heart and Soul, especially those. Also the screenplay definitely needed work. The Actions were often too quick and it did not allow to really connect with the characters as we are supposed to. Acting wise it was okay. Roberto Begnini's second attempt to star in a Pinocchio film was definitely the better one. He did quite well, although it wasnt much of a role. I was much more impressed by Young Federico Ielapi, who really transformed into that role. The make up Department also did a truly Wonderful Job. The Production design was fantatic too. As for the rest, well, it felt like the Story was just to support the technical aspects and not the other way around.",Pinocchio
23,BrnzReviews,Pinnocchio Is Great!,9,11 May 2021,"Pinnocchio! What a fantastic movie, this film definately outlines the dark parts of the story book that the animation could never show. Pinnocchio is a phenomenal watch i really enjoyed watching this, having familiarised myself with the animation when I was a kid it was great seeing it ome to life in such a beautiful way.I'm so glad that Disney didn't make this, if they did it would be so watered down, you wouldn't know half of what goes on in the book through the animation, they did it in such a compelling way, a true storyteller with a great director, from what I've just seen.I would highly recommend this movie to everyone of an appropriate age, but wow, what a watch this was defonately an experience i needed to have. If I've helped you make your choice please give me a good vote:)",Pinocchio

2020
PG
Director: Matteo Garrone
Starring: Federico Ielapi, Roberto Benigni, Rocco Papaleo, Massimo Cecherinni, Marine vacht, Gigi Proietti etcOverall rating 49/100Pinocchio is a live action reimagining of the Disney classic, about a wooden puppet on his quest to become a real boy. Pinocchio had it's moments of charm but was too messy and beyond bizarre to be considered worthy of watching, so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film did have a more realistic portrayal, more added plot and likeable/well done characters that matched up to the original movie. I did appreciate the film's more realistic portrayal of the plot and characters, which due it being live action worked very well and provided something different to the original despite having similar elements to it, I also liked the added plot, despite it not always working I appreciated that the movie was trying to add something new to the movie, and for some of It the added content worked for adding more to the characters or just for a fun plot. I also liked the likeable characters/good portrayals of the characters, the portrayals of Chepetto, Stromboli and fox and cat were all very well done and reminded me a lot of the original characters, with either the same charm or recognisable personality traits.However, my first few negatives would be the films underusage of characters, lapses in the logic and lack of depth. The film underused a lot of key characters that made the original so great, Jiminy cricket was criminally underused and whenever he was on screen he didn't really serve any purpose, he had no charm and lack of mature advice never really came to light. There was also a fair amount of lapses in the logic. A significant part of Pinocchio's character is that his nose grows when he lies, he did this multiple time throughout the movie, it showed inconsistent character work and stuck out like a sore thumb when the scene happened, when you have such a big focus on his nose growing in previous scenes then so drastically contradict yourself it makes the film seem unprofessional and messy. My next negative would be the film's lack of depth. Considering the films added content I was surprised at the lack of depth to the plot and characters, they could have had so many opportunities to add more depth to the characters that never materialised. The script and dialogue were about as simple and bland as they come and effected the movie a fair amount.My final few positives would be the nostalgia, cinematography, and charming tone. The film despite the added content did largely stick to the nostalgia play with scenes similar to the original, and I couldn't help but occasionally get that warm feeling in my stomach as some scenes transported me back to my childhood when I first watched the Disney original. I also thought the films cinematography and set pieces were very good. The film had many beautiful moments and had a lot of attentions to detail with the scenery around the characters which I really appreciated as a fellow film student myself. The film did also manage to achieve a charming tone for a good chunk of the movie. The film did manage to achieve a lot of the charm of the original movie with it's characters and handling of the movies messages that made the film in parts more watchable.My final few negatives would be the odd decisions with Pinocchio, pacing issues and conflicting tones. The film decided to make Pinocchio very unlikeable in parts that did not suit his character at all. He managed to achieve the complete opposite to what his character is supposed to be, he lied constantly, and was horrible to Jiminy cricket which is fine when he is naive and not sure what he was doing but he was just insulting people making him not deserve the end result of the movie. The movie also had bad pacing issues, the film was extremely slow, and often just felt like similar scenes repeated, making it hard to watch in places as there was never anything within the movie that really captivated me. And finally my least favourite part of the movie has to be the conflicting tonal issues. There was so many different tones throughout the movie that it just made it an absolute mess to watch, it didn't balance any tones out, it was briefly charming and then suddenly really bizarre, the film was also way to dark in places with some perhaps unintentionally offensive costumes and scenes that should not have been in the movie.Overall Pinocchio, despite having some moments off charm and being visually pleasing, whilst also trying something different, never executed what it perhaps intended, leading to a messy, bizarre adaptation that is not very recommendable.",Pinocchio
25,eskimosound,Wonderful...,10,4 February 2021,I've never seen Pinocchio so this was a real eye opener. All of these old Fairy Tales are dark morality tales and this is no exception. I watched it because it has the wonderful Roberto Benigni in it and I wasn't disappointed. Another Oscar winning performance by this talented actor and the little Federico Ielapi did a wonderful job as Pinocchio. It's a dark fairy tale as the original intended and not a Disney musical. Truly wonderful.,Pinocchio
26,coombsstephen,A terrible film that has scenes not suitable for small children,2,16 August 2020,I am sure for it's original audience this film was ok but after it had been dubbed into English the film becomes a joke. It makes no sense half the time as obviously the narrative is chosen just to fit the lip sync.I won't add spoilers but there were a couple of scenes in this film that I thought were quite disturbing for a small child. It may be part of the original fairy tale but it wasn't what I would think most adults would want Thier small children to see.Overall quite an odd and disturbing film that has little redeeming features.,Pinocchio

29,Come-and-Review,Should be released internationally asap,9,4 January 2020,"PinocchioGarrone's adaptation brings back the magic and some of the grit of the original fable with a Del Toro-esque magic.I can't really understand how 'Pinocchio' can be considered dry or boring, on the opposite, it might be Garrone's most emotionally involving feature. The director of Gomorra and Dogman is no stranger to the adaptation of fables, a few years ago he directed The Tale of Tales, with an international cast, an adaptation of fables written by a sort of southern Italian equivalent of the Grimms.There's a great deal of faithfulness to the original novel.
Various scenes of the original Pinocchio have been forgot over the years, but this new adaptation is not afraid of reinstating them. At the sane time, the story maintains its original picaresque value and message. Some scenes, mostly due to film lenght, where however omitted nonetheless, but the most important sequences are all present.I did say that this Pinocchio has a Del Toro-esque feel, that is due to the implementation of extensive make-up and props for all the various creatures that Pinocchio encounters during his journey, and on pinocchio's actor himself. The result is so flawless that honestly I don't know how Del Toro can overcome it with his own planned stopmotion version that's going to be released a few years from now.The cast should be also noted, with Benigni, Gigi Proietti and more well-known actors that seem just perfectly fit for their roles.I should also mention the scenery, very italian, very rural, and stunningly photographed.Italian cinema suffered through the years, but it's certainly not due to the filmmakers, but rather the poor marketing and limited distribution. I really hope that this movie gets widely distributed internationally.",Pinocchio
30,Rino_Bortone,"A TRUE, HONEST AND DEFINITELY TO APPRECIATE PINOCCHIO IN THE YEARS TO COME",7,16 June 2020,"Who knows Matteo Garrone, knows the boldness of this man in conceiving old and new stories according to his style, his vision, his creativity. Pinocchio by Matteo Garrone offers a new, albeit yet another, vision of the famous wooden puppet created by the brilliant Carlo Collodi, an entirely Italian history with a vast resonance all over the world over the years, making Pinocchio one of those stories to be repeated and preserved and here, Garrone, succeeds. The film has many strengths, starting from the Oscar-winning Roberto Benigni (already seen as Pinocchio himself in the past) which this time portrays Geppetto and perhaps is to be counted as the greatest interpretation ever since the days of the good Nino Manfredi's one, as well as the little Federico Ielapi, who with his little genius entertains and makes himself loved from the public as did the famous Disney's Pinocchio. Spectacular CGI, not always purely-perfect, but daring, courageous, high quality for an Italy-France-Great Britain production, where, unfortunately, you do not always have the pleasure of tasting the genius of these nations in this field; perfect makeups, which do not even envy Hollywood's ones and in some ways can be placed in the ""old-school"" class, simply to say that they are materially splendid, especially, for the first time ever, in seeing an actor in flesh and blood becoming a wooden puppet. Powerful sound sector, with a scrupulous attention to detail, especially from the point of view of the soundtrack composed by Dario Marianelli, which enhances every single scene and line of the screenplay, as well as the cinematography of Nicolaj Brüel that fully marries Garrone's imagination and style, making unique the view of the picture. The only flaw, maybe, is the too much haste to present some crucial scenes, almost as if to say ""you already know what's gonna be"". In conclusion, Pinocchio is a spectacular film, expected and appreciated, thanks to the brilliant mind of Matteo Garrone who marries perfectly with the rest of the crew. A true, honest and definitely to appreciate Pinocchio in the years to come.",Pinocchio
31,isaacsundaralingam,"It had its moments, but Pinocchio being the stupidest version of the character for 125 minutes just pissed me off",4,9 April 2021,"First of all, I don't really care if an adaptation deviates from the original. As long as the movie is good, I wouldn't complain. But Pinocchio is just a meaningless mess.The movie had a very charming introduction I thought. I was actually invested in the strangeness of this universe. Until the filmmakers decided to push the limits of how much the audience could tolerate. The shift between it being charming to being straight up weird and uncomfortable was so jarring that it actively made me want to stop the movie halfway.And regarding the protagonist puppet Pinocchio... I just couldn't root for him after a certain point. Charm and a childlike sense of wonder can only work on you so far until you realize that you're supposed to be rooting for the dumbest character in the movie who is bound to make the worst decision in any given situation.Technically though, the movie holds up. With stellar camerawork, a grim but fairytale like production, makeup and costume designs... I don't have any complaints technically.I just feel that anything good I could say would simply not amount to how unlikeable the main character is and how played out the conflicts begin to seem after a certain point.",Pinocchio

39,lumieretrain,Pinocchio (2019) by Matteo Garrone,8,20 February 2021,"The book Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi is one of the most important fables of all time, which has and it still influences several artists, filmmakers, authors and so on, to create adventurous stories filled with magic, surprises and beauty to be surprised. By adding, likely in the novel, the morality on the changes from naivety to responsibility, and the way the main characters learn to take the right choices, after they have committed some mistakes. The auteur filmmaker Matteo Garrone seemed very intrigued, to elaborate an adaptation of the book Pinocchio; to make his movie version as faithful as possible, with the original work by Carlo Collodi. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Pinocchio by Matteo Garrone with Robert Benigni, Federico Ielapi, Rocco Papaleo, Massimo Ceccherini and Marine Vatch. The movie's plot: The old woodcarver Geppetto (Roberto Benigni), creates a puppet, with a magical wood which he has been given; it lately comes alive as a little wooden child, to be called Pinocchio (Federico Ielapi). Once Pinocchio comes alive, he would face an adventurously long journey, which is filled with magical surprises. Usually is difficult to find some of the new ways to surprise the audience, when a story like Pinocchio has been adapted multiple times. As the audience would already expect, what is going to happen in the story. Instead the movie would surprise the audience, from the beginning to the end; by using some of the most essential magical elements, which the book contains, without being predictable at all. The production designer Dimitri Capuani has created the sets, which make the scenes look like a theatrical stage; by using periodical elements mixed with fantasy style, as the details have been elaborated to create the magical essence, from the book, needed for the movie. The costume designer Massimo Cantini Parrini has created the costumes, which fit with the soul of the characters, both in their shape and in their expressions through the colors. The cinematographer Nicolas Brüel has captured, through the lenses of the camera, some of the most unique moments of the movie; by creating unforgettable shots to be memorable, in every camera movements as well as in every angle shots. The make-up artists Dalia Colli and Mark Coulier have created the make-up and the prosthetics, in the most realistic way to be careful in every single details, to be applied on the cast. Especially to the cast who play the characters, who have some of the most grotesque look. The visual effects have been elaborated to make the movie look magical, in every single details of the pixels to be build shot by shot. Especially on some of the most visual moments of the movie, to be technically complicated which occurs time until the work is completed. The editor Marco Spoletini has created a rhythm, which works in the particular way on the movie's narration. To be clear how the movie would be told, from the beginning to the end, in the themes and in the atmospheres of the story. The score by Dario Marianelli has been elaborated, to create a unique melody which mixes the innocence and the adventurous themes of the story. As it would be followed through the atmospheres of the story, by describing melodically the feelings of the characters. Robert Benigni did a marvelous performance as Geppetto, a woodcarver who creates and becomes the father of Pinocchio. He loves Pinocchio so much, to have lately a special bond with his son; especially after several misadventures have happened in the story. Francesco Ielapi did an excellent performance as Pinocchio, who initially would be an energetic naive little wooden boy, to get easily in the troubles. Until he would lately learn the meaning of responsibility, to not get in the several troubles, like he has been initially facing them. Rocco Papaleo and Massimo Ceccherini did both really good performances as the Cat and the Fox, who would do anything to rob Pinocchio; by even inventing absurd stories, to make him fall in the traps. Marine Vatch did a really well done performance as the Fairy with Turquoise Hair, a fairy who would teach some of the most essential lessons to Pinocchio; to give him lately a special opportunity, after he has been through several misadventures. Pinocchio is one of the most unexpected surprising movies, which is filled with magical moments to be unforgettable from the beginning to the end.",Pinocchio

The craftsmanship in cinematography, color, set design, costumes, makeup and lighting is inspiring escapism and desperately needed change from all the mediocre movies that have come out in the last decade and especially during this pandemic.I actually teared up just from seeing the amount of love of the craft put into this movie and in how the story is told. Everything looks authentic and mixes realism with the right amount of special effects that don't appear digitally dropped in that maintains a truly dreamlike experience.I felt like I was in old world Italy somewhere back in the 1800's.

You can like or dislike that part, but omitting it is a complete disrespect of the author. Then, the acting. Benigni basically plays himself. Mangiafuoco is played by a honest-to-god marvellous stage comedian which is quite obviously off role. Pinocchio's part is played by a kid whose acting skills are quite wooden (hah). The only truly great acting comes from Cat and Fox. Scenery and musics and costumes are nice, but that's about it. Flat movie.",Pinocchio
