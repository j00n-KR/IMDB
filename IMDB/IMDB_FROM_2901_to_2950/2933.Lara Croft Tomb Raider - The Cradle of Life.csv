0,TheLittleSongbird,Witless and convoluted action adventure sequel.,3,5 September 2009,"I liked the first Lara Croft movie, but I found this sequel awful on the most part. Angelina Jolie is great at the stunts, the stunts by the way were fine and actually one of the three redeeming qualities to this, but her acting was below par, lacking warmth and charisma. Another redeeming quality is some of the locations. Ciaran Hinds hams it up, a term I try to avoid using, as the villain, Doctor Jonathan Reiss, and one of the better actors in the movie, he was pretty entertaining, despite his senseless dialogue. Gerard Butler and Jon Voight have little to do, and came across as useless. The script was largely unfunny and lacked conviction, and the plot, about the search for Pandora's Box, makes little sense mostly. All in all, not absolutely abysmal, and may be entertaining for die hard fans, but this sequel for me was a misfire. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
1,Leofwine_draca,"Loud, overblown, effects-filled...what you'd expect, then",4,15 November 2016,"To be blunt, I didn't really think much of the first TOMB RAIDER. Sure, I enjoyed it for the visuals, the sets, and some mega impressive special effects (particularly the scene with the statue coming to life), but it was very much a 'blah' kind of movie. I rated it kindly, but now two years later and the sequel is out, I can't help but to be blunt: this film stinks. A dull, clichéd bomb without an ounce of common sense or originality in it, this rips off half a dozen James Bond movies by having Jolie globe-trotting in search of Pandora's Box and fighting an evil mega-villain and his henchmen in the process.Nearly everything is wrong with this movie. Plot holes are apparent throughout, nobody really bothered writing any decent dialogue – just embarrassing cliché after embarrassing cliché – there are no surprises and almost no suspense. The film goes over-the-top in its attitudes to stunts and action. Okay, it is based on a computer game, but is it really necessary to see the pointless water ski stunts and the ridiculous pole-vault onto a helicopter scene? These should have been cut out for being plain stupid, but no, they make up most of the movie. To be fair this is a tougher film than the first – more on-screen death, a lot of violence (really hard punches, a little blood here and there, it pushes the boundaries the same as TERMINATOR 3) but it just feels like everyone is going through the motions and making this film purely for the money. Nobody seems to have their heart in it.Director Jan De Bont hammers another nail into his own coffin after the diabolical THE HAUNTING remake, a film which is, somewhat incredibly, much worse than this. I really enjoyed his SPEED 2, which everyone else hated, so I was hoping THE CRADLE OF LIFE would be a similar surprise. Unfortunately not. The film is well shot, yes, but the action is predictable, there aren't enough battles or fight sequences to sustain interest. Some of the fights – the saluting rifle scene for instance – are just dumb. A parade of familiar scenes are played out with tons of moments ripped off from other, better films. There's a shoot-out in a glass laboratory, a shoot-out on the rooftops of Hong Kong, a fight in a cavern, a battle between heroine and villain come the end. Wow. Big deal. From the first moment when we see Jolie punching a CGI shark we know this film is in deep trouble, and unfortunately the material never gets any better. The air dive scene is the most impressive in the film, but you can tell straight away that stuntmen are involved so it kind of lessens the effect. A scene at the end of the film with monsters attacking the bad guys just feels out of place, the monsters (""shadow beasts"") seem to have been closely modelled on the excellent troll fight in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. It just feels stupid here, it actually had me laughing out loud.Angelina Jolie is an attractive actress and seeing her show off in a number of increasingly tight or skimpy costumes is almost worth the admission fee. Notice I said 'almost'. Unfortunately she seems to have forgotten how to act, putting in an embarrassing performance with over-emoting all the while. I used to think Jolie was a good actress on the strength of her turn in THE BONE COLLECTOR but she needs to get out of this dreck if she wants to win back some credibility. As for Gerard Butler, he's a wooden bore, and his character is so unbelievable that you just have to laugh come the final twist, which makes a mockery of everything. The only decent performance comes from a nicely hammy Ciaran Hinds as the villain; at least he's enjoying himself, and some of that enjoyment wears off. Chris Barrie provides comic support once more, but is hugely underused. Hong Kong cinema fans may be pleased to see action hero Simon Yam in a rather small role as a Chinese villain, good to see him in a Hollywood film nonetheless.So, at the end of the day, this is a film you can easily skip, unless you like big and stupid stunt sequences which push credibility to breaking point (nothing on Jackie Chan), some pretty locations, and some cardboard cut-out characters parading around. There are only two things I enjoyed in this film. The first was the realisation that one of the Chinese guys from the MY LUCKY STARS series was cameoing in the scene with the villain on the plane, at the beginning. The second was the really nasty bit where a guy dissolves in a pit of acid. Gruesome stuff.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
2,SnoopyStyle,Sophomore curse,4,3 June 2014,"Adventuress Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is diving the lost Luna Temple of Alexander the Great in Greece and discovers a glowing orb. They are attacked by Chen Lo and his men. Lara barely escapes. Meanwhile, mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) is searching for the mythical Pandora's Box which the glowing orb is the key to. MI6 needs Lara's help to go after Chen Lo who plans to sell the orb to Reiss. Lara gets Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) released to go on the hunt with her.Lara explains that in 2300BC, an Egytian Pharoah located the Cradle of Life and Pandora's Box which contains a plague or anti-life. The Box destroyed the Pharoah's army and he sent it away to India to be hidden. Alexander the Great rediscovered the Box, returned it back to Cradle of Life, and its location on the Orb.The story is way more complicated than it needs to be. There is so much exposition to get through at the start. It may work for a video game, but it doesn't work well for a story. This is basically a female James Bond but only more ridiculous. At least, the first one had the fun of something new and shinny. This one repeats the same formula but it feels old. The outrageous action feels tired. The exotic locations aren't quite so exotic since most of it takes place out in the wilderness or on an obvious sound stage. Even wing gliding over Hong Kong feels slow and boring. Lara is as cold as ever and Gerard Butler doesn't add enough heat. In a sophomore movie of a franchise, they need to go bigger or go home. They didn't go big enough.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
3,claudio_carvalho,A Great and Funny Adventure of Lara Croft,8,21 March 2004,"The evil scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) is trying to get the Pandora Box to release death around the world. Lara Croft (Angeline Jolie) joins to the mercenary and former love Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), trying to avoid Jonathan to achieve his objective. This is a very funny action movie. Of course it is not cerebral, but the story is not so bad, and the action scenes are very well choreographed and the locations around the world are magnificent. I personally did not like the fake British accent of Angeline Jolie, since it does not fit with her. But this film is much better than the last James Bond movies, it is not so good as the Indiana Jones ones, but it in the same level of `The Mummy' or `The Scorpion King"". For this type of action movie, It is a worthwhile entertainment. It is ridiculous that a viewer expects to think about anything watching `Tomb Raider'. When I want to think, I see an Ingmar Bergman's (one of my favorite directors) or any art film. Yesterday, for example, I saw `L'  Emploi du Temps', a movie about the sad and bitter face of the unemployment in the middle age. When you see a movie like that, you think, reflect, judge the character and the situations. But when I watch `Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life', I certainly expect to laugh, to have a light entertainment and lots of fun. The scene where she punches a shark probably is the funniest in this good movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `Lara Croft Tomb Raider: A Origem da Vida' (`Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Origin of Life')",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
4,jboothmillard,Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,2,4 September 2009,"The first film based on the successful video games was pretty terrible, so it is pretty obvious a sequel isn't going to make any improvements, from director Jan De Bont (Speed, Twister). Basically Lara Croft (Razzie nominated Angelina Jolie) has found an important find with an orb that will lead to the mythical Pandora's Box, and travels from China to Tanzania via Greece in search of it. But her mission becomes difficult when villain scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) who is behind making deadly viruses, and obviously wants the destructive power of the box. So to help defeat him and get the orb back, Lara is accompanied by British marine turned mercenary (and old flame) Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler). Also starring Christopher 'Chris' Barrie as Hillary, Noah Taylor as Bryce, Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Kosa, Til Schweiger as Sean, Simon Yam as Chen Lo and Terence Yin as Xien. Jolie, put into obvious titillating outfits and still sporting an Elizabeth Hurley English accent may look the part, but the story and action sequences still don't grip you. In fact, it's so boring I can't remember one decent moment, just as bad as its predecessor. Pretty poor!",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Thankfully, No Third Is Planned",4,16 July 2006,"Considering ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was pretty good entertainment, this sequel was a disappointment. Critics disagreed and liked this one better, but I disagree with them. As with most sequels, it just overdoes what was popular in the first film.In this case, that means the action is WAY overdone (since it was too much on the first film, to begin with); ""Laura"" becomes WAY too much of a feminist-macho icon and Jolie's British accent here is so phony it's embarrassing, and annoying to hear.On he good side, I enjoyed the exotic locales (Far East and Africa), it had very little profanity and some of the stunts were wild and fun to watch. As far as I know, they don't have another sequel planned, which is smart.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
6,Tweekums,An enjoyable sequel that is as much fun as the original,7,30 June 2017,"After an earthquake in Greece treasure hunters are searching the sea bed to see what they can find. These include Lara Croft but she believes the others are looking in the long place. She is convinced that the Luna Temple where Alexander the Great hid his greatest treasures is nearby and sure enough she finds it. Once inside she discovers a mysterious orb but before she can remove it the villain Chen Lo turns up, kills her companions and takes the orb.After being rescued she is approached by members of MI6 who want her to recover the orb. It turns out that it contains directions to the Cradle of Life where Pandora's Box of Greek mythology is believed to have been hidden. They state that Jonathan Reiss, a Nobel Prize winning scientist who has become a bio-terrorist is also after the box because it contains a virus for which there is no cure. Lara accepts the challenge but insists that that former colleague/lover Terry Sheridan is released from prison as he is the only person she knows who can get her close to Chen Lo. Their adventure will take them to Mainland China and Hong Kong before they finally discover the Cradle of Life in East Africa.When I watched the first Lara Croft movie I didn't expect it to be that good but found myself rather enjoying it; enough to give this sequel a go. I'm glad I did as it is at least as much fun as the original. The story is of course a bit silly but that doesn't matter; it is fun and provides lots of exciting action. This includes plenty of fights and shootouts, CGI monsters and an impressive wing-suit jump from a Hong Kong skyscraper. Angelina Jolie does an impressive job as Lara Croft, making the highly unlikely seem believable she also looks great in costumes designed to show her off to her best! Ciarán Hinds also impresses as the villainous Jonathan Reiss, thankfully he plays the character straight rather than as a pantomime villain. Gerard Butler is solid enough as Sheridan but the character isn't as interesting as he could be. The special effects are pretty good even if it is fairly obvious that most of them are CGI. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the first film or just wants a solid action film with a few fantasy elements.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
7,ma-cortes,Adventures and action-packed in charge of a video-game heroine,7,9 May 2005,"The movie centers on Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) who is assigned by the British Intelligence -MI6- to discover the Pandora box that the baddies (Ciaran Hinds and Til Schweiger) want to find with the purpose of ruling the world . She is helped by an imprisoned mercenary (Gerard Butler) that will be freed , and two sympathetic underlings who appeared in the first part (Noah Taylor and Christhopher Barrie) . They'll have to confront amount of dangers , adventures and risks until reach their aims .Run-of-the-mill action film because from the beginning to the final the frenetic action , thrills and fast movement are continued and unstopped . The picture blends emotion , intrigue , thriller , suspense , rip-roaring scenes and a little bit of violence when the fights happen . It is a film pretty bemusing and entertaining . It's a typical modern action film : continuous struggles in leaps and bounds , running men while are shooting and interminable pursuits . Besides , there are spellbound landscapes of various countries where the starring are traveling around the world to resolve the enigmas . The ending confrontation amongst the protagonists and enemies on the Kilimanjaro's skirts is breathtaking . The picture is similar to previous part with the difference in this latter there is an adventure chum (Gerard Butler) playing a type of ¨buddy movie¨ role. Thus , the storyline is basically a rehash of the former picture . Just as in the first film, there are several scenes in which the live-action Lara mimics are mingled with the computer generator effects . The film attained moderated success at box office , less than the first one , and not as good as the anterior . I don't know if the producers are going to make a third part .David Tattersall's cinematography is glittering and glimmer as is well reflected on the awesome and impressive outdoors in charge of the production designer Petruccelli . Alan Silvestri's music is atmospheric and marvelous . The motion picture was well directed by Jan De Bont (Speed) . It is very spectacular , it is a film for adrenaline lovers . The yarn will appeal to Angelina Jolie and Lara Croft videogames fans.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
8,dbdumonteil,how to squander 90 million of dollars on a lousy sequel,1,1 July 2006,"I am not nutty at all about video games but I admit that ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" is a benchmark in the history of video game. Such a triumph with an adventuress who made a household name around the globe could only have repercussions in the cinema with the decision to transfer to the silver screen Croft's adventures. Thus, the first installment opened in the summer 2001. Its amount? A shallow, empty adventure movie because it remained stuck on the aesthetics of the video game and the clichés of the adventure film. But rather excellent figures must have rejoiced the producers to prompt them to do it again.Francis Veber, a French filmmaker who gave a boost to French comedy by giving it the recipe of the mismatched pair (see the delicious ""la Chèvre"", 1981 and ""le Dîner De Cons"", 1998) once expressed his judgment about sequels in general: ""what is a sequel? Generally a shoddy remake of the first film"". How this relevant opinion is applicable to ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life""! It's chiefly a photocopy of its elder brother, so why bother? Take and pen a faded, join-the-dots story which takes Croft in the four corners of the world searching for a mysterious object supposed to guide her to the Pandhora box which shelters deadly powers. Fill this story with characters or rather puppets because they have so little depth including the one-time lover who may have or not a crush on his fiancée again, the caricatured boss of the baddies. Then, bestow this story with two-bit obligatory elements (the Chinese mafia, notably the boss Reiss has a keen interest in finding the Pandhora box and so tracks Croft down), lackluster action sequences and you get a cheesy product cluttered with so-so special effects probably to palliate the glaring weaknesses of the scenario. A skimpy one which lets the average viewer guess that the scenarists may have experienced a block writing their story or maybe its loose potential reveals a strong intention from the producers to count on a second commercial success while neglecting rigor in storytelling. Then, what is annoying is this nagging would-be deadpan humor which helps to mar the film and even the presence of a specialist in action film, Jan De Bont doesn't redeem at all this abysmal product from absolute wreckage.From the Pandhora box, everything baneful that can damage a film like ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: the Cradle of Life"" got out and destroyed it. At the bottom, remained what could have cured this film: originality. The fans of the video games: why not rushing on them again instead of wasting your time with this poor man (woman)'s Indiana Jones?",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
9,Doylenf,Impressive stunts do not a movie make...,5,26 July 2005,"ANGELINA JOLIE makes the most of showing her prowess at performing stunts that any male would envy, but the showcase for her physical skills is hardly worthy of her presence. The script is as shallow as the video game it is based on and no one has much of a chance to give any depth to their characters.As a result, even her co-star, hunky Gerard Butler with his Scottish accent, has trouble registering more than a ""go through the motions"" kind of performance. The chemistry between him and Jolie can only be described as ""icy"". Not to worry. He later steamed up the screen two years later with his Phantom role and a scorching ""Point of No Return"" sequence that had his female fans gasping for breath. Here, I have to report, he is sadly wasted, except for a couple of daring stunts that he and Jolie perform well together.Ciarin Hinds, as the villain, later joined Butler for PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. He would have been more convincing here with the mustache he assumed for his Phantom character. Something is missing in his evil portrait. He just doesn't seem comfortable in the role.Things keep moving, stunts every few minutes, explosions, gunfire, jumping off tall buildings, dazzling neon explosions, all accompanied by Alan Silvestri's booming soundtrack music. But in the end, all we have left with is a stuntathon sort of thing that is pointless in tracing the story of the search for Pandora's Box and the quest for an orb. It's cliffhanger stuff for the mindless and that's about all.Not worth two hours of viewing time and the ending is rather lame.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
10,poolandrews,"Nice scenery & locations, shame about everything else.",3,18 April 2010,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life starts in Santorini where an earthquake hits, the location of the long lost & forgotten Temple of Lunar of Alexander the Great has been revealed & tomb raider Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) is on the scene. Inside the temple Lara notices a strange glowing orb which she intends to take but a gang belonging to the Chinese mobsters the Shai Ling who steal the orb & leave Lara for dead. Lara is rescued & survives, she is contacted by MI6 who want Lara to retrieve the orb as biological weapons designer Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) is about to get his hands on in after arranging to buy it off the Shai Ling. Lara discovers that the orb is in fact a map to the mythical Pandora's Box also known as the Cradle of Life which is where all life originated but also contains a deadly plague that wipe out all life, Reiss wants it to sell to the highest bidder on the black market. It's up to Lara to stop Reiss & prevent the Cradle of Life ever falling into the wrong hands...This American, British, Japanese & German co-production was the sequel to Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) which while not a very good film any anyone's eye's was actually rather successful, the original's director Simon West wasn't asked to return & the studio instead bafflingly went for Jan de Bont who has a string of disastrous box-office flops & films regarded as real stinkers including Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) & the remake of The Haunting (1999) so why he was chosen to helm this I will never know. Anyway while I wasn't a huge fan of the original Tomb Raider film it was still watchable but this sequel is just terrible, the first few minutes sums up the whole embarrassing affair as during an earthquake a DJ doesn't duck for cover but tries to protect his music equipment & a scene where while trapped underwater Lara cuts herself to attract a shark which she punches on the nose & then grabs it's dorsal fin to ride it to the surface (the shark also roars & the expression on it's face when Lara punches it is quite hilarious). The film is a collection of poorly thought out action set-pieces which have a few striking moments but overall are dull. From base jumping off a building to descending ropes upside down while still fighting off bad guy's to pole vaulting to an airborne helicopter to various silly fights & shoot-outs as the bad guy's just line up to be shot or beaten up. The character of Lara is awful too, she has no personality whatsoever, there's not one moment in this where she has to act like a real human being & when Lara has to make some sort of emotional decision at the end it comes across as badly written soap opera dramatics that made me cringe. At almost two hours this felt longer, the plot is absolutely threadbare with nothing to involve or captivate the viewer (we never really understand why Reiss would want to unleash a plague that might wipe out all life) apart from some silly stunts.The film isn't even historically accurate either, the way Pandora's Box is described in this doesn't resemble the one featured in religious legend, there are also huge dating inaccuracies although I suppose I could cut it some artistic license. The one bright aspect of Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life are the stunning locations, many sequences start with a wide landscape shot of some fantastic looking locations as the camera zooms like the opening with that amazing town build on & around mountain peaks or the Hong Kong skyline or when they jump from that building & the city is seen from above or the wide plains of Africa with it's wildlife to temples carved into the side of cliff's containing terracotta armies this looks great & it's a shame such great visuals are wasted in a pretty poor film. Besides being an action adventure this has fantasy elements including some cool CGI monsters at the end.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 a lot of money was spent on this & while it looks great & the locations are visually fantastic I would have expected something a little bit more for ninety big ones. The acting is OK at best, Jolie can't act but looks alright while Gerard Butler is wasted as he just stands back as Lara takes center stage.Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life is a poor big budget Hollywood action film that is a Raiders of the Ark rip-off but nowhere as exciting or as good. A really bad script, silly action scenes & a lack of any intelligence sinks this one. Watch the original again instead, a third Tomb Raider film is listed on the IMDb as being in production.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Mindless Fun of the lets just go sort.Its nothing great it just is a fun two hours of action and adventure. Frankly it felt like a long ride, but a good long ride, like I've been around the world and then some. This is opposed to the ""can't anything exciting happen"" of Bad Boys 2 (released about the same time).If you liked the first mindless film this is better, different, very different its a stripped down machine that goes at top speed to the end, where the first had to introduce characters and tried for a complicated plot.The villain is evil from the first introduction of the Ebola laced drink to the last gasp before Lara puts him in his rightful place.The characters are well defined and perfectly realized in the action speaks louder than words sort of way.As mindless entertainment its a four star romp- it probably should be a star lower but with the bad movies I've seen of late its nice to see a really really good fun movie..",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

14,Boba_Fett1138,Fails on many fronts.,4,28 January 2004,"A weak story and sloppy editing makes this movie a disappointing one, a shame because it had lot's of potential which such a great director attached to the project.The main problem is the extremely unrealistic story and action that is without any logic. The story really feels like an huge Indiana Jones rip off and uses lot's of elements used in the Indy movies but the execution of the story is weak, especially when you compare it to the Indy movies. The action itself is at moments pretty cool and there are some truly awesome scene's and fight choreography but however it's extremely unlikely even for an action movie based on a video game and the sloppy editing also doesn't do any good to the action.The movie moves in a too fast pace where too much is happening in a too short amount of time. The action happens too quickly and is over too fast, just when it is starting to get interesting. The story also doesn't feel as a whole. It feels like a movie with just some scene's attached to each other without them having to do anything with each other.But sure, there also are some things that are good about this movie. Such as the cast, Angelina Jolie is perfect for her role and no I am not only just talking about her looks but also about her acting abilities. She seems to be born to wear the Lara Croft outfit. A great move was casting Ciarán Hinds as the main villain because he is such a great actor and he pulls of really well in this movie. The movie also contains lot's of fun and humor which is I think mainly thanks to Jan de Bont's directing. Also the fine cinematography is notable.The special effects are very uneven. At times they are perfect and at times they are extremely fake looking.Still I believe that Lara Croft still has all the potential to become a great action hero and has elements to make a good film about.

15,anaconda-40658,Tip the Cradle Over.,1,8 August 2015,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003): Dir: Jan De Bont / Cast: Angelina Jolie, Gerard Butler, Noah Taylor, Ciaran Hinds, Djimon Hounsou: About as much fun as being thrown down a flight of stairs and landing in a huge pile of nails. What is the cradle of life? It sounds like an episode of Rugrats. This is yet another Hollywood excuse to show off special effects while intelligence is neglected. Laura Croft kicks the crap out of villains in search for an orb and Pandora's Box. It winds down to Croft being sent on a mission and beating people upand beating up more peopleand beating up even more people. It all ends when there is no one left to beat up. She decides to surprise us and shoot her last victim. One of Jan De Bont's worst films and that is quite the achievement to create something that is even worse than Speed 2: Cruise Control. He also directed the original Speed as well as the remake of The Haunting. Angelina Jolie is reciting something that wasn't good the first time around, let alone worthy of a sequel. She looks the part but acting is far from her biggest concern with this film. The production values rapidly become the entire film and replace the actors as the film's real star.

Liked the use of the locations in Santorini, Hong Kong, Africa etc. The director made unique interesting use of the places.The cast is top notch. Gerard Butler has chemistry with Angelina but his accent is a bit too thick in some parts to understand. Cirian Hinds is a dignified enough villain. Djimon Honsu is good in an real authentic looking African role.For those who didn't like the first movie so much, this is quite different. It's grander feeling. So it's a good follow up since it departs on the first one instead of rehashing it.Overall one of the more enjoyable action adventure movies.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
17,Aaron1375,"I enjoyed it for what it was, but not as good as the first.",7,29 July 2003,"This movie was all right, kept me entertained for the most part, but it needed more and less.  The story is a bit better this time in parts, but it is also worse in others.  I was kind of hoping I would hate this movie as most critics and people seem to, but I enjoyed it so now I suppose I will get private messages from people saying I should hate the movie.  Well don't bother writing me please.  The movie starts out with a cool underwater temple scene, and this is the highlight of the movie.  It is also the only part in the movie that feels like the tomb raider video game.  The rest of the movie has some good stuff, but it doesn't feel like tomb raider, more like a spy movie or something.  At one point there is a scene with monsters that look like they belong in the Lord of the Ring movies.  For what it was worth it was ok, but these monsters were kind of out of place.  At least the stone warriors from the first movie have actually appeared in the game.  I would also love to see Lara go into an actual tomb for once.  Sure the underwater temple was cool, but it was just one room.  Like the first one all the tombs here are usually one room.  Can't they have here go through a really long tomb with multiple traps and stuff for her to shoot at?  Also, I wish she would have used her guns more.  I shoot more in five minutes of the video game than she does in this entire movie, and she always loses her weapons too.  Not that I don't want to see character development and stuff, but this is a movie based on a game, it should be a bit more action packed than what we get.  All in all though it was okay, I enjoyed it, but it just wasn't as good as the first for me.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
18,Mr-Fusion,"Still nothing great, but tolerable",5,23 June 2015,"To its credit, (the awkwardly-named) ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - Cradle of Life"" sets out to put some zip in the franchise's step. The direction's more assured, Angelina Jolie labors to liven up her character's personality, and the story cuts right to the globe-hopping (minimal languishing at Croft Manor). But it still suffers from Awful Villain syndrome, and it's . . . well it's kinda dumb. But at least there's some energy to this thing, and there's also Ms. Jolie in quite the pleasing swimsuit. Also, she punches a shark. It's still not a great movie, nor does it do anything for the ""video game movies suck"" reputation, but parts of this can be kinda fun in a goofy way.5/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
19,JamesHitchcock,Indiana Joan Meets Jane Bond,6,18 September 2009,"""The Cradle of Life"", or to give it its full, rather clumsy, title ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" is the second (and so far the last) film in the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise. Both films in the franchise make use of a formula derived from the ""Indiana Jones"" series. An intrepid adventurer in some exotic part of the world is seeking some relic or artefact with mystical powers and which also being sought by a gang of villains, whom the intrepid adventurer must outwit. This formula also formed the basis for the various ""Mummy"" films and, in a slightly amended version, for the recent ""Bulletproof Monk"". The mystical artifact in this case is Pandora's Box. We are asked to believe that the said box is not merely an something from an ancient Greek legend but a real object which has been lost for over two thousand years since it was hidden by Alexander the Great in the mysterious Cradle of Life. Alexander had good reason to hide the box as it has the power, if opened, to unleash a deadly plague. It is now being sought by an mad scientist named Jonathan Reiss who intends to use it to achieve World Domination. (The normal ambition of the villains in this type of film). It falls to Lara Croft, a female archaeologist who doubles up as a British intelligence officer, to thwart Reiss's evil scheme. To add to the complexity of the plot there is a second McGuffin in the shape of a magical luminous orb that serves as a map that will reveal the location of the Cradle of Life. Lara therefore has to track down first the orb then the box itself. Lara Croft is a sort of Indiana Joan-cum-Jane Bond, and the Bond franchise was clearly another influence on this film. (Was the name ""Jonathan Reiss"" a subtle reference to actor Jonathan Pryce, who played the villain in one of the Bond films, ""Tomorrow Never Dies""?) The characterisation of Lara as a sophisticated English aristocrat owes something to the character of James Bond, especially as played by Pierce Brosnan who was the current Bond when the first Tomb Raider film (known as ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") came out in 2001. Like Bond, Lara travels to exotic locations in the course of her adventures, in this case to Greece, China, Hong Kong and East Africa. The action sequences are also reminiscent of the Bond franchise. The Tomb Raider films, of course, reverse the sexual balance of the Bond films, with the glamorous, scantily-clad female here becoming the heroine in her own right rather than the hero's assistant or love interest. (One of the main purposes of the film seems to have been to show off the gorgeous Angelina Jolie in a variety of revealing outfits). Just as James always has his Bond Girl, however, so Lara has her Croft Boy in the shape of her old lover Terry Sheridan, a Royal Marine turned mercenary whom she springs from prison in Kazakhstan to help her in her quest. It is something of a cliché to say that sequels are never as good as the original films, but there are exceptions to this rule and ""The Cradle of Life"" is one of them. ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was rather dull, but its sequel is considerably better. The action moves along at a good pace, the action sequences are well done and Angelina makes a fetching and sexy action heroine. An enjoyable popcorn adventure in the Bond tradition. 6/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Only this time, she needs a Scottish and extremely attractive partner who is known for his betrayals. Of course, love can always get in the way of saving the world. Well, this Lara Croft wasn't as exciting as the first. It was just a sexier version, obviously because Angelina at the time was named the sexiest female. But in my opinion, this sequel just tried too hard to be like the first one, only sexier. But it does have the same cool stunts and another pretty interesting plot with some awesome scenery.

A promising action director once responsible for the thriller-epic ""Speed"" - now resorting to formulaic action sequels.The title may as well just be ""Angelina Jolie In Tight Clothing"" because that's basically the selling point. Let's face it - the appeal doesn't stretch far beyond her chest. As an action-adventure movie it's incredibly weak and uninspired. As a tongue-in-cheek adventure movie in the vein of ""Indiana Jones"" and ""James Bond"" it's just a helpless rip-off. As a video game adaptation it is a good example of running off with a character or title and just making the final product bear absolutely no resemblance to the initial inspiration.But, to be fair, the only real selling point of the video game series was (a) Nerds got to immerse themselves in exotic locales as a beautiful female (which means they were free to stare at her computer-body for hours on end) and (b) there was some good action.I never really played much of the games. The first game never really worked on my old PC and I played an interesting demo for one of the sequels once - but the reason they work as games is because it's interactive. The plot in a game can be utter crap and still be engaging for the most part. A movie, on the other hand, is not interactive and after staring at Angie's boobs for twenty minutes it's kind of like, ""Okay. Enough."" Basically, anyone who has seen or has access to ""Original Sin"" can skip this because the goods are delivered much better in that film. Gamers looking for a well-done adaptation will find themselves disappointed by an action-adventure cross-breed that never takes off.Is it better than the original? In parts.

It lies buried somewhere, hidden by Alexander the Great in the 4th Century B.C. when he discovered how virulent and deadly the contents of the box really were. Now, twenty-four centuries later, Lara has to try and prevent an evil billionaire capitalist from locating the container, prying open the lid, and bringing an end to civilization as we know it.Though the storyline is clearly not one to be conjured with, all that really matters in a movie such as this one is that the action move quickly and the stunts be sufficiently enterprising to engage the audience. Credibility is the last prerequisite in a Lara Croft adventure, as evidenced by the fact that if Lara isn't parachuting smack dab onto the deck of a ship or into the passenger seat of a moving jeep, she's hitching a ride on the back of a great white shark and riding it to safety. Ah well, it's all in good fun, I suppose, and Jolie not only looks stunning in all the outfits she's been given to wear, but seems to be having a fine time playing along with the joke.The ending is inevitably anticlimactic, but viewers can have a pretty good time getting there at least.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Since some of the negative reviews here said there were some good stunts I did fast forward and found an action scene around the mid-point but it wasn't any good either, so I gave up on the thing.

It's amazing to me that someone was able to take the premise of a game that I spent hours enjoying and make two very mediocre movies.

I realize that these movies can't be exactly like the games (PETA would have a fit if Lara was shown killing as many animals as she does in the games), but come on. The sense of adventure and the thrill of reaching the goal is completely lost in these movies. In its place, we have overblown special effects and stories that are utterly ridiculous.The saving grace, as in the first film, is Angelina Jolie.

Certainly Angelina Jolie is as sexy as you can get, but there is too little else in her character to make her the female James Bond that the authors of the series want her to be. Even the sentimental track in this second movie does not succeed to make her more real. Director Jan de Bont succeeded much better with the original story in 'Speed' or the reality-TV like effects in 'Twister'. In 'Tomb Raider 2' he is just mixing a potion of James Bond with a little bit of Indiana Jones, without too much of a result.

I can hardly find anything wrong. There was a big drop off in box office totals from the first film.

I also thought that Ciarán Hinds and Djimon Hounsou performed good too! Good special effects. The film has an incredible amount of action! The part where Reiss and his men have Croft prisoner was believe it or not on the scary side! Great suspense! The Shadow Guardians were awesome! That scene where the monsters attack rulez! The music is by one of the greatest composers in My opinion and one of My favorites Alan Silvestri! Very good theme! This is My favorite of the two Tomb Raider films!

Her success is critical since failure is not an option.Since I had already watched the first movie of ""Lara Croft"" I had high expectations by it but I was disappointed. It did not have the same suspense and action as the first movie and it was boring at some points. The direction which was made by Jan de Bont, it was average and I believe that he did not reach his potential. The interpretation of Angelina Jolie who played as Lara Croft followed the same pattern of the first movie and it was highly predictable. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" is an average action movie but good enough to spend your time with if you have not something else to do or to watch.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
35,johnnyboyz,"Somewhat dreary; teenaged orientated; globe trotting archaeology adventure, whose gaps in logic are daft and insulting and whose company gradually comes to grate.",5,5 November 2010,"Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont's Tomb Raider sequel, to the woeful 2001 Simon West original, begins with a long track across some waves a long way out at sea. The shot goes against the natural flow of the waves in an odd, unnatural manner, creating a series of compositions involving the water and the waves in what is an act of going against the grain of an item. de Bont's film does anything but go against a proverbial grain; a nigh on two hour slog through familiar, well worn action genre territory and teenage crowd pandering which culminates in a lacklustre finale so disappointing, the film needs to call on inspiration from 2001's The Mummy Returns to see it home. Where it improves on the first film is in its director de Bont, whom has always been a better cinematographer anyway, who seems to be having more fun with what is effectively B-movie material than West's dark and dreary first edition did. Where it flails overall is in its execution, screenplay, authenticity and overall story: the basic hallmarks of filmmaking. Boy, does Raiders of the Lost Ark have a lot to answer for.de Bont's film sets out its stall fairly early on: an action sequence; female leads punished for their transgressuality; token foreign villains; painfully expositional dialogue and certain other content I'm not even sure under which banner to categorise. It seems those in charge of the wardrobe department for this film, of which the full title is Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, perhaps thought that Angelina Jolie was kitted up in too many clothes during the first film. Jolie's titular Lara Croft, originally of 1990's video game-fame, crash lands into this edition by riding out to a large yacht on a jet ski performing extreme-stunts whilst wearing very little but a little black bikini number that she unnecessarily keeps on for a couple of subsequent scenes once on deck; later, the combination of a body suit without a bra has its own desperate results. She's aboard this yacht so as to journey to a nearby cave off the coast of Greece so as to investigate following a large earthquake – but before you know it, some Asian baddies have shown up; shot the place up and she's had to escape by way of rapping a shark on the nose just prior to calling on an actual submarine to come and rescue her at alone out at sea.Having spent the entire budget it took to produce The Blair Witch Project five times over on the opening ten minutes alone, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life mutates into a plethora of stuns, shoot outs and uninteresting clashes between super-villains and heroes alike as it bunny hops from exotic locale to exotic locale, establishing every new place with iconography so easy, it looks like it was lifted from a tourist board promotional video. The film's tendencies to lean towards a buddy partnership is different to the first in that it gives the lead something to do than gloomily and unemotionally shift from set piece to set piece as in the first; here Croft is partnered with Terry Sheridan, Scottish ex-Royal Marine turned mercenary with whom she shares a past; therefore enabling Jolie's character to break into something resembling a smile or a grimace now and again. Sheridan's introduction sees Croft escorted to a remote, ice-cold Kazakh prison in snowy nowhere; where hands and arms of inmates reach out to grab those walking down the grim and hostile corridors. Sheridan gets a cell all to himself and we're reminded of Clarice Starling's descent into the bowels of the asylum she visits in The Silence of the Lambs prior to meeting Lecter for the first time. We get there with Croft; the door's opened and there stands a ruggedly handsome looking Gerard Butler, of all people, doing exercises – needless to say, we don't buy it.The reason for their teaming is because of a certain evil, super-rich, super-villain named Jonathan Reiss (Hinds); a man whom operates with brutal efficiency in that he poisons an employee he suspected of wrong-doing without any hesitation. He's described by London's MI6 branch, to Croft, as a ""modern day Mengele"" when it's outlined attaining the Pandora's Box, of ancient Greek mythology, will enable him to deprive the world through the ridding of those he deems unworthy so as to reconstruct a super-race. In this regard, that makes him a modern-day Hitler; also, for those whom it is the film is aimed at, will many of them know exactly whom it is Josef Mengele was? Lastly, at what point in his life did Mengele dabble in germ warfare anyway?Principally, the film thinks there's more drama and more edge in their relationship in regards as to whether Sheridan will just take off for freedom leaving Croft high and dry, than there actually is. Butler's ever alert, ever macho mercenary anti-hero sits up at one point and verbally deduces that he and Croft are ""two sides of the same coin"" – an instance that, when the film requires the characters to literally inform us they're of this ilk, usually means they aren't at all and the tactic is one of a masking variety. One thing leads to another, Croft at one point coming into contact with a mysterious orb Reiss and a triad gang, his relationship with has gone wrong, are frantically trying to come into contact with because it tells you precisely where Pandora's Box is located. Why Croft doesn't just destroy the orb when she can meaning nobody will ever find the box, we'll never know; while the sub-Last Crusade inspired finale of being forced into the depths of nowhere so as to fetch an artifact reeks of Harrison Ford's venturing off to fetch The Holy Grail. For all of what's unfolding in front of you, and given what's at stake, this is a desperately dull effort.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
36,filipemanuelneto,"A waste of time, this film was made to make money.",2,22 January 2020,"Although not entirely bad, I reasonably swallowed the first film. This was a lot more difficult. The story is much more imaginative and, therefore, it was even more difficult to have logic for me. The script is essentially based on the search for the mythical Pandora's Box. Lara has the support of the British Secret Service and must reach the box before a dangerous villain.If the first film was based entirely on the action scenes and the script was designed to support them, in this film this is even more evident, with the added fact that the action is much more boring and cliché than in the first film and the script is more than secondary. Even if those who watch these films are not looking for any revolutionary masterpiece, it would have been nice to see that some attention was paid to the script and there was a concern to make a decent story. But not. When trying to repeat the formula used in the first film without adding anything new or different or even better, the film resented and shows signs of wear, like a car that has not been seen by a mechanic in ten years. The film continues to be fast and the fighting action scenes follow each other without causing more than a few yawns to the audience. Bad boys, monsters, supernatural situations, we have it all. Only aliens and Indians from the West are missing. The ending is uninteresting, uses a lot of obvious and unrealistic CGI and never surprises or surprises us.Angelina Jolie managed, with the previous film, to reach stardom and a sex symbol status that would open doors for more mature works. She also made a lot of money from these two films. However, after a good performance in the first film, in this one she does not do more than she needs to do to justify her salary. The support cast remains practically reduced to existence, so it is easy for Jolie to stand out, especially with those clothes making her breasts and legs stand out.If the first film was still worth seeing, this film was made only to profit from the success of the first.

The sequel to my biggest guilty pleasure is actually a better film in itself. Adding a thickening agent to the plot, realistic action set pieces and far more characterisation for our eponymous protagonist. Mmhmmm this is a tasty blockbuster that really needs more love. Lara Croft is requested to stop a megalomaniac from finding the mythical Pandora's Box and unleashing a deadly weapon that could potentially destroy the world. Greek mythology, ancient temples, rural and urban China, the wild plains of Africa and, to top it all, a boat with Spongebob Squarepants on...in Chinese. It's as if Jan De Bont knew what makes my mind tick and put them all into one glorious picture! What made its predecessor so damn enjoyable was how silly the whole thing was. This time, they decided to make it slightly more realistic in terms of story and action which does make a refreshing change. No more stone statues or time storms, just guns, motorcycles and squirrel suits. Which I must say the stunt work and action set pieces were magnificent and the usage of CGI is kept to a minimum. Hooray! A multitude of beautiful backdrops including Hong Kong, Greece and Kilamanjaro which illustrates how well travelled Lara is. Angelina Jolie gave yet another committed performance although her false British accent was more noticeable. Gerard Butler gave a functional supporting role and had decent on screen chemistry with Jolie. The cheesy dialogue did help with becoming attached to these characters. Ciaran Hinds was fine as the antagonist but don't involve him in combat scenes...it's like watching a kid break apart Lego. The third act dives into the silly and concludes in a depressing manner but fortunately it's a Lara Croft film so you should only take it with a pinch of salt.

39,Vartiainen,I don't feel this one,6,23 December 2013,"I'm torn about this film. On the other hand, I cannot quite pinpoint the differences between this and the original Lara Croft film, and yet it feels inferior in every aspect. But why is that? Why do I feel that this isn't as good as the original. Well, novelty might be one explanation. The first Tomb Raider was fresh, new, something we hadn't seen before. This one is just the first one with a new coat of paint, which is never a good thing.One explanation might also be that I don't really like Gerard Butler's Terry Sheridan as a character. The first Tomb Raider was great because the focus was on Lara. She was the undisputed hero of her own story. In this one I feel that they regretted that decision and decided to add some unneeded masculinity into the mix. And yes, this is hypocritical, because if any sequel to a male lead adventure film decided to add a kickass female character, I wouldn't complain at all. Unfortunately, that's the world we live in, and I cannot lie about how I feel about Terry.I also miss the interplay between Lara and her father. The first film was very focused on her character and the stages were personal. Not so much in this film. Lara quests for the Cradle of Life, not because it means something to her personally, but because she's ordered to do so and she just went: ""Yeah, I didn't have anything planned for the weekend anyway."" A workable solution if you don't have anything else, but it's a bit on the weak side.Otherwise the movie is pretty much identical to the first one. Gorgeous locations, great stunt sequences, imaginative action scenes and Angelina Jolie is as great as always, although the need to cover her up in order to cover her tattoos is a crime against humanity. So, if you liked the first one, I'd give this one a watch as well. It's not quite as good, but it's not noticeably worse either.

And forget that there is little to no archaeological worth whatsoever to be found within the reels of this attempt. Also, let's forget that a 135-lb woman with a 6"" wrist can not possibly HOPE to stop a shark swimming at a 45 mph velocity, with a punch to the nose; that the game element is completely absent from this installment of this ""game"" series; and that the ""Bond"" element, while still present, has been greatly reduced herein (not an altogether bad thing).If you completely forget these features, facts, and elements, leave your logical mind at the door, and allow yourself to be led into this adventure, you may yet be able to enjoy this attempt.The sets are nice; not as well done as the first, but the story line IS a coherent story with a decent plot and some great execution. Additionally, there was even a small smattering of character development dealing with Croft's aloof personality.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this time Angelina Jolie actually got to ACT, which almost made this as fun an endeavor as the original.However, the sets were lacking, as were the effects, and do not miss the incredible disappearing parachute scene when they land on the barge. Now you see 'em, now you don't. It was incredible to me that they would leave the final cut this way, but I'm afraid the whole industry has gone more for the eye candy, and less for quality, recently.

First of all having creatures like them was unrealistic (unlike the monkeys and the statue of who knows what in the first movie), and they also looked like CGI with no realism. The ending was bit lame (but I won't go into details), and I thought it could have been better.Angelina Jolie shows sign of aging in this movie, and maybe she knew it and canceled the third sequel (but I wish she would have gone for it).

A summer film that doesn't spend its budget in too many costume changes or with CGI effects that are designed to tell us that more is better.  I enjoyed one good villain, and this film's might not be the best, but at least one understands why the scientist is so evil, and what he is exactly planning.The film has plenty of action to satisfy an audience that wants to see a clear story, exciting stunts, beautiful and exotic locales, and one heroine that kicks...  Angeline makes excellent use of her strong and fascinating personality.  She's a complicated heroine and has no qualms about showing us a strong female role.  She is also fantastic to look at while she engages in a few demanding exercises.There are a few terrific moments in just about every possible place. You'll be shocked in the ocean, a few minutes into the film.  You will certainly love gliding through the skies of Hong Kong, and you will have fun in some of the most terrific fights of the year (and these don't go on for 5 minutes...)Much better than the original, and by the way I should say that this is NOT necessarily a sequel.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

45,ShootingShark,Enjoyable But Undistinguished Tomb Raider Action-Adventure Sequel,6,26 June 2005,"Unorthodox archaeologist Lara Croft is hired by MI6 to stop a terrorist arms supplier from locating the legendary Pandora's Box of Greek mythology. With the aid of a renegade soldier, Lara tracks a locating device for the box to Shanghai and manages to steal it. It leads her to a mythical African crater known as the Cradle of Life, but her enemies are closing in fast ...This is a great action movie - it has wonderful exotic locations (Shanghai, Hong Kong, the African savannahs), terrific stunts, a glamorous and talented leading actress, good special effects, and rolls along at a cracking rate. It is nicely photographed, has tremendous sets (by Kirk Petruccelli), a good score and is well-edited. Despite all this though, it is slightly disappointing, simply because the previous Lara Croft movie is much better. This film is much more dogmatic - what little humour it has doesn't come from the characters, and the it-all-happened-in-the-past love story between Jolie and Butler isn't very involving. Jolie is terrific in this role but she had a lovely irreverent quality in the previous movie that is absent here. The supporting cast aren't very strong - Butler is okay, but Hinds is a rather bland businessman villain and Taylor isn't given anything to do. Still, my griping aside, there are several tremendous set-pieces here - the opening underwater adventure, a great gunfight in a hi-tech lab, skydiving from a Hong Kong skyscraper and a rather nifty Phantom attack. An enjoyable actioner, but a shame it doesn't live up to its predecessor's standards.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
46,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A good follow up,8,3 June 2013,"In 2001, fan boys and gamers alike were able to get their eye full with Angelina Jolie in the lead role as Lara Croft. It may not have been a success in critics' eyes but it did well at the box office and fans wanted a sequel. So as a follow up, this movie doesn't perform badly at all. But it does lack a few details that keep it from being as good as the first. The majority of these flaws lie in the writing as well as some character development.In this story, Croft is set on the quest to find Pandora's Box and keep an evil money mogul from getting his hands on it and causing countless deaths around the world. So to accomplish this task, she once again calls on her friends and companions at home and around the world to assist her. The two important ones that most fans like are Hillary (Chris Barrie) and Bryce (Noah Taylor). I was happy to see them reprise their roles - their presence in the first added comedic relief to various situations, as do they in this installment.Of course, Jolie as Croft is still a great choice. Her athletic and flexibility abilities are still impressive and are similar if not the same as the moves that Lara Croft does in the video game. And I don't know if it's just me but I found Jolie to be even more attractive in this picture. Her face is different. Playing the evil money mogul is Ciarán Hinds. Hinds also puts in a good performance. He may not be the most sinister of villains but he's no fresh apple either.Accompanying Croft in her journey across the globe is an ex-boyfriend named Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) who is good with guns and I agree, he is. I also found him to have a funny sense of humor with his Scottish accent. What upset me about though was that writer Dean Georgaris wrote his character to be untrusted and unpredictable. That caused the character development between Sheridan and Croft to whither. They had good chemistry but they were always up and down. Like a love-hate relationship. Can we just pick a single tone for these two? I also didn't like how Georgaris did not explain what happened to Alex West (Daniel Craig) from the first movie. Craig's character did not die so why wasn't it at least explained where he was or why he left? Continuity people! But that's really all I have to nit-pick about. I enjoyed the action which felt solid. The director, Jan de Bont, who also directed the megahit Speed (1994) seems to have a good idea what an action movie needs even though his profession lies in cinematography. I also felt that the musical score provided by Alan Silvestri instead of Graeme Revell was an improvement. It expressed action, tension and feeling at the right moments. Although it's not as great as the first, I still liked it.Its writing is a little off with character development and continuity but it still holds up strong. The characters are still fun to watch as well as the action and improved musical score.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
47,Rob_Taylor,"Entertaining enough, but a bit silly.....",6,22 June 2004,"It's a trend amongst screenwriters, I think, to write up ever more ridiculous scenes for their movies now that CGI effects can deliver the visuals. LCTRCoL isn't bad when compared to the likes of Charlie's Angels Full Throttle but it still has it's ""stupider than stupid"" moments.The most memorable of these is when Croft (Jolie) punches a shark to frighten it off. This, I don't have a problem with. But when the shark, after being punched, shakes it's head as if groggy, I do. I know I shouldn't take these sorts of things too seriously, but it's just this sort of imbecility that gets on my nerves and ruins my enjoyment of a film. Sadly, I suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of this kind of idiocy in movies in years to come.The film as a whole isn't that bad. It's entertaining enough in a ""brain off"" kind of way, but it seemed to be lacking something that the original had. No, I don't mean John Voight. Somewhere along the way, this sequel seems to have become a cheap rip-off of itself. If you changed the actors and altered the title to something like ""Laura Soft: Grave Robber - The Anthill of Strife"" you'd have some idea of what I'm getting at. It's like someone made a clone of Tomb Raider, but then found they had actually used the same actors from the original without knowing. It's like one of those Star Wars rip-offs from the 70's or 80's. At least, that's how it seems to me.Now, as I said, it is a harmless way to spend an hour or two and, the odd scene apart, there isn't too much to offend the intellect. But it's all just so ""samey"" that it's a relief when it's finally finished.Not bad, but not that good either.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
48,eric262003,Exciting Action Though Quite Predictable,8,31 August 2015,"Thousands of years ago, Alexander the Great discovered the greatest source of life on Earth, the Cradle of Life. The power within the box that was dubbed Pandora's Box was had a plague-like side effects that the ruler had hidden the box and has never been revealed since then. Today, an evil bio-terrorist named Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is in hot pursuit of that box and is willing to exploit its powers to our vulnerable world. Lady Lara Croft, assigned by the MI6 was called upon to retrieve the box before it's placed in the wrong hands. That's pretty much about the story of ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life."" The opening scenes start off like you would expect set in the Santorini Islands off of Greece where fishing boats are all around. Then all of the sudden, a speeding jet ski appears on the scene and makes a flip onto one of the fishing boats. Sure enough it's Lady Croft. Just then, a massive earthquake erupts and ironically opens up a secret, mythological hideaway hidden undersea, which might be Alexander's Luna Temple. So Lady Croft and her crew get in their deep sea gear and start exploring the area in hopes to find The Cradle of Life. Croft and her crew discover an orb which could be the element that could lead to The Cradle of Life, and Pandora's Box and all the powers it contains. What Croft doesn't know is that the leader of an Ancient Chinese gang called the Shay Ling, Chen Lo (Simon Yam) also has his mindset on that orb. During the fight, he and his men grab Lady Croft and strand her in a cavern. While this happens, the quake aftershock comes into effect and closes the temple down. The always resourceful Croft makes a miraculous escape as she hops onto a shark for safety. Lady Croft's journey takes us around the world as she's assigned by MI6 as Dr. Croft enlists a former British Commandeer, now serving as a mercenary who's been incarcerated in Kazakhstan named Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler). If he promised to help her on her dangerous mission, he promised Sheridan his freedom, amnesty, 5 million pounds and the return to British government. For if her mission fails, than Reiss will have the power for world domination, the orb that will open Pandora's Box and unlock a mysterious disease which could lead to a potential global epidemic. The globe hopping adventure takes us from Greece, to China, to Hong Kong and finally to Kenya, where it's claimed that the Cradle of Life is situated. Video game aficionados will likely have their eyes set on this sequel to the Lara Croft video game adaptation and might even like it better than its predecessor. Angelina Jolie is great person to watch as she's both intelligent and quite stunning to look at. but there thing that really makes her stand out is that she carries a big set of guns. Come on guys, we all know you're all smitten for foxy chicks with huge guns. This movie has several action scenes that could compare to that of the more recent James Bond movies. If the Broccoli family wanted to change genders of Bond, she could be the next Bond. Even though Jolie carries the bulk of the film, the supporting cast does a fine job as well. Butler does a great job as Croft's partner and shows that he's not just a sidekick to Croft on her dangerous adventures. He has the physical toughness and the good- looking appeal and is anything but a tag-along for the ride character. Sure the romance element between him Croft were not needed, but it never hindered the film in the least. Many of the cast seems under- developed as they can be just bullet shields for our leading heroine. Cieran Hinds is convincing as the evil genius even if his bad guy role is clichéd. However German actor Til Schweiger stands out in much- needed comic relief as Reiss' sidekick,Sean. Returning to the sequel are Christopher Barrie and Noah Taylor as Croft's technological experts Hillary and Bryce, but are not prominent in their roles. Same can be said of Djimon Hounosu as Croft's Kenyan companion.The technical features are in sync with the big-budget that came into making this sequel (it was $300 million worldwide). The stunts, costumes, choreography and the cinematography was a first class act in itself. A big shout out goes to Jim Henson's Creature shop at providing some invigorating monsters when Lara and company enter into the realms of the Cradle of Life. The Cradle itself looks like a carbon copy of the famous Escher painting, you know the painting with all those stairs surrounding the area. And the stairs are going around different places. ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life"" is something that both boys and girls can both enjoy. for the guys because of the immense popularity of the classic video game this movie's based on and for the girls an iconic female hero they can look up to. And for fans who love thrill-seeking sagas like Indiana Jones, James Bond or the Bourne series, will truly enjoy this film as well. But as more films are dependant on saturating the screens with CGI graphics, I fear that if they spawn another sequel of this series, it will not exceed the expectations of the first one and this one.

The look of the spooky environment and those shadow monsters and the Escher kind of caverns were fun to watch. But unfortunately, for most of the film there's a ""been there, done that"" kind of feel to it which never really elevates it above the level of tediousness.The actors are pretty much wasted here. The actor who played the villain wasn't good. Chris Barrie and Djimon Hounsou are wasted in minor roles. But Gerald Butler is a revelation. Hope to see more of him in other movies. As for Angelina, well, she's beautiful but she's sports one expression throughout the movie: a stupid smarmy grin with her eyes beaming. I don't know who decided for her to act in such a way but it just didn't work. I don't blame Angelina for this but director Jan De Bont, who's one of the worst directors working in Hollywood these days. Jan simply cannot direct actors or action scenes. Yes, Jan directed SPEED but he also directed the wretched SPEED 2, TWISTER and THE HAUNTING.

52,mentalcritic,"Jan De Bont, thy name is wasted potential...",2,16 October 2004,"When I look at Jan De Bont's resumé, I think of all the brilliant Dutch projects he has worked upon, and then I think of the films he has directed in America. The gulf between the two is such that even the less discerning can't help but be amazed. This is, after all, the guy who worked alongside one of Holland's favourite sons, the legendary Paul Verhoeven, on such indisputable triumphs as Turks Fruit or Flesh + Blood. To call directing such dreck as Speed or Tomb Raider 2 a comedown is a form of flattery.Lara Croft, Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life, also proves one of a certain critic's rules regarding appreciating film based on their titles. The rule basically states that the longer the title is, the worse the film will be. Just as RoboCop, clocking in at a mere seven characters, is one of the greatest films the American film industry has ever been blessed with, Tomb Raider 2's full title clocks in at a whopping forty-two. Believe me, the quality level indicated by this under the aforementioned rule is very much in force here.A classic example of this film's idiocy is when Lara, bleeding from one leg and stranded outside an underwater crypt, punches a shark in the face before riding on his back and finding a quiet place to sleep out on the ocean for an unspecified period. I'm no expert on sharks, but I would have thought that the impediment to motion that being under several hundred feet of water poses would make a punch in the face feel to a shark what a light poke in the nose would feel to us under normal circumstances. Not to mention the fact that, after lying out in such a large body of water for so long with an open wound, at least another shark is bound to come along sooner or later.One area where Jan deserves credit is that I've never seen him resort to the use of shaky-cam. Thankfully, directors of European origin saw right through the party line that this puts the audience into the action, and realized that it does nothing of the kind. As a result, while many shots are too close for comfort during action sequences, they are at least stable enough that one can make sense of the actors' motions. The fight scene choreography is of such a quality that it doesn't need to be hidden from the audience.Angelina Jolie seems to have a lock on strong woman characters that are so generic she can portray them all alike, yet she does this template so well that at least this audience member fails to notice. The problem here is that every character in this film is so generic that you cannot help but notice. Jolie's acting is never that brilliant, but she looks like Anna Paquin next to Gerard Butler. Noah Taylor is another classic example of a reason why I am not surprised that Australian entertainers rarely manage to get out of the isolation tank that is Australia. Seriously, this guy could be reading a description of Angelina's naked body and bore the hell out of me.I gave Lara Croft: Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life a two out of ten. Don't mistake this to mean that it is necessarily better than the films I gave a one out of ten. When I give something a two out of ten, that means its mediocrity makes it seem like a deliberate waste of a good hundred million.

As a result of the first film and recent entertainment, similar lead female action movies are in the works. Halle Berry's character, Jinx, from Die Another Day and Jennifer Garner's Electra from Daredevil are two possibilities. This follows the Hollywood trend of copying, rather than creating anew. The male characters support Angelina well, in what she has to do, but serve as eye candy too. I love her outfits! The movie is very much modeled on James Bond movies: exotic, multiple villains; electronic gadgets; multiple modes of transportation and locales; multiple shoot-outs and explosions; witty dialog (at times); and topical plot developments. I'll admit I only saw this movie because the other two on the bill were worse choices in my book: Bad Boys 2 and American Wedding. The whole ""cradle of life"" thing was intriguing at first, but became very lame and out of place in this movie for me. It's always a big mistake for action fare, particularly similar to this movie, to try to send a message or say something profound.

55,vitaleralphlouis,A 50% Drop in Box Office is Not Enough!,1,2 August 2006,"Most people who saw the dreadful first Lara Croft movie had better sense than to see this dreadful sequel --- there's also a 50% drop in opinions expressed on this website for the 2nd film vs the first --- but here it is on TBS in my hotel room. Most of this picture was cribbed from other movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was, in turn, cribbed from the far superior Grade B movies of the 1940's. There is absolutely no original thinking, or thinking at all, involved in this brash insult to the intellect of we moviegoers. I think even Bevis & Butthead would find this movie shallow. Reflecting the self-loathing that comes to Hollywood movie makers who earn big salaries for creating garbage movies is their disrespect for the achievements of others. Before 9/11, the World was outraged at the Taliban for their willful destruction of the ancient Buddah statues in Afghanistan. In carrying forward the Taliban Mentality herein we have a large collection of the Terra Cotta statuary recently discovered in China after being buried for 2000 years. In this movie such things exist solely for the players to destroy as backdrop to their silly overacted fighting. Besides disrespect for ancient treasure, there's disrespect of current human life, such as Asian people. Chinese people talk funny and jump around like ants when people thoughtlessly drop helicopters and other debris on their heads, there homes, their livelihood. See Chinee jump round, talk funny, ha! ha! This the moral and cultural bankruptcy of the Hollywood reflected by this movie.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
56,fernandoschiavi,"The Cradle of Life is better finished, more fun, smarter, however, with a number of problems that still hold you in the midline",6,24 October 2020,"Despite facing several criticisms and being considered a film far short of what it could deliver, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider was successful at the box office, which soon ensured a sequel, bringing Angelina Jolie once again in the role of archaeologist Lara Croft. After the enthusiastic statements by Jolie, who said that she would only return to the series if the script this time was really good, it seemed that Tomb Raider would finally be able to establish itself as a level cinematic adventure. But the actress herself proved that her statements should not be taken too seriously. It is astonishing to see how good characters and interesting arguments can be so mistreated when in hands that they do not give the necessary attention. Lara Croft, the heroine from video games, is a version of skirts (or rather tight bodices) by the well-known Indiana Jones: a millionaire archaeologist who loves a good adventure. However, instead of exploring this side through a well-prepared script under the coordination of a professional, try what we have - for the second time! - It is a production that sometimes borders on amateurism, full of inexplicable holes in the narrative and situations so foolish as to be embarrassing.In this sequence, the archaeologist and adventurer discovers in a submerged temple, amid sharks, a mysterious sphere that contains a map for Pandora's Box. However, when losing the globe to Chen Lo (Simon Yam), the leader of a Chinese mafia group, Lara must prevent the criminal from negotiating the artifact with a terrorist named Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds). With the ball in hand, the unscrupulous villain intends to take over the mythical Caixa - which contains all the evils of humanity - and sell it as the weapon of the Last Judgment. To try to stop all this, the heroine will have the help of an old boyfriend, the ex-British soldier Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler).If Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) didn't excite a lot of people, it didn't hurt anyone either - unlike this second episode, which gets tired from the start. And it is at the very beginning, because instead of starting with a big and agitated scene - which would serve to capture the audience's attention right away - he preferred to go for ill-arranged explanations of what would happen next, with much talk for a little while. action. The film begins by exploring Angelina Jolie's sensuality very well, which is a positive factor, considering that its target audience is male teenagers who drool over Croft's digital figure and can now see her in the flesh -and-bone experienced by the woman who is Jolie. But after the first sequences, the sensuality of the actress vanishes amid villains, good guys and situations without any charisma, which will make many sleep while watching the movie. Which is a shame because the original film made me watch all the time. In the sequence, it is likely that everyone will watch the clock, as long as the minutes for the time to pass faster.The Cradle of Life continues in the same scheme of the original film that the script by Dean Georgaris cannot improve what had already been presented: characters that are great caricatures, or stereotypes, of bad guys and good guys who exaggerate in actions and reactions, which they do remember the characters we find in the series games. There is also a little bit of humor between and during the action scenes (which makes the film a great joke, only boring) and a little more philosophical conversation, exploring the sentimental elements of the story very badly. The legend about The Cradle of Life originating from a box is, at the very least, curious, but as already mentioned, it is explored only superficially, towards the end of the film.Under the direction of Jan de Bont (Maximum Speed and Twister), the film gained a breakthrough in the field of action, having a more organic passage between sequences, considerably lessening the hassle of looking like we were in a poorly edited short film. When the Chen Lo (Simon Yam) mafia comes on the scene, the film changes its tone a lot. For a moment, we have a solid exposure of a cat and mouse game where Lara is the young lady who needs to prevent the orb-map from falling into the hands of terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds, in a robotic and sickening interpretation). The arrival of Lara's former boyfriend, former British military-traitor Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler, oozing charm and with a twist of laughable and unnecessary behavior at the close), the journey to stop the Last Judgment begins.
The surprises seem to work well while in Asia. By the route, by the relationship with the Tempo de Alexandre, by the cultural clues placed in the script, we have no problems in following the first block of searches. But after the escape from China, there is a lot of indecision at stake and nothing to replace the emptiness that the lack of information brings us. There is no problem with putting ""lost"" characters in the middle of a hunt like this. It is a simple and recurring feature of creating suspense, anyone knows that. But while they don't know where to go, another layer of the script should be strengthened. It doesn't happen here. And the price to be paid is high, because the difference in narrative quality is immense from the development to the final part of the work. Our luck is that the director Jan de Bont does not lose his hand and keeps his style of action mixed with suspense and twists, which suits a film like this very well, keeping us attentive and waiting for the next ""blow"".With the kidnapping of Lara's employee friends and the narrowing of the text for an adventure in Africa, the thing is really lost. What cinematographer David Tattersall (recently out of The Attack of the Clones and 007 - A New Day to Die) was able to do prominently only when the duo arrived in China and the duo escaped from China (that sunset, the beautiful plan of the two kissing - aesthetically beautiful and sexy kissing scene is not as common in cinema as it seems) he got it in scenes shot in Kenya. Although the effects of the Acid Lake and the ""protective spirits"" are laughable and, in the text, give a dimension ""too magical for our taste"", they do not interfere, unlike Alan Silvestri's final compositions for African scenes, which appear to have been made for another film.The action of The Cradle of Life would again be the only positive factor of the tape, if the market was not already saturated enough with films with a lot of beating and little content. Archaeological investigation is once again treated with the appearance of a tourist agency brochure. Lara runs the world frantically - fueled by the restless hand of director Jan de Bont, but, unlike an Indiana Jones, she doesn't delve into the mysteries of other cultures. In fact, as an archaeologist, she looks like a monkey in a crystal shop. Suffice it to say that in one scene, she unabashedly destroys an entire army of very rare terracotta soldiers.But the problems permeate the production, and not only in its premise: to begin with, we have a pair on the scene without the least chemistry, who at no time can function as a romantic couple. Angelina Jolie is a perfect Lara Croft, but alongside Gerard Butler, the two seem to compete to see who appears most on camera. The script the two of them need to deal with, full of redundant and boring dialogues, as well as repetitive, is of no help. The special effects, if well executed, are unreasonable, with no role in the plot and displaced on the scene, without a context that justifies them, such as the arrival of jet skiing, the motorcycle race over the Great Wall of China, the shooting in the submerged temple, the fight with a shark - in fact, one of the most bizarre and lying scenes ever seen in the cinema -, the clash with the digital ""monsters"" who are guardians of the cradle of life, etc.).The Cradle of Life is better finished, more fun, smarter, however, with a number of problems that still hold you in the midline.

While the first film has an okay script with so-so dialogue, this time around, the script is even worse and the dialogue below average. The fact that there was only 2 years between the first Lara Croft and this sequel probably meant that the filmmakers rushed this film into production for the sake of making more money off the Lara Croft franchise. Well, bad decision in this case - this film was not only a critical but box-office failure. Just to mention though: I very much enjoy Angelina Jolie whom I consider a great actress - it's too bad she was given a poor script to work with this time around.

62,movieguy1021,Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life: 5/10,5,16 August 2003,"I was not disappointed at Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. I went into it with certain expectations, and they were met. It was everything that I expected it to be. It had some good, if stupid, action scenes, Angelina Jolie looking good in various skin-tight outfits, lame characters and inane dialogue. The poster is the greatest of the year so far. If a summer movie is what you want, this will be perfect. If you're looking for an atypical movie that just happens to be released in the summer, look elsewhere, because Tomb Raider doesn't have an ounce of anything worthwhile. Ten minutes after you see it, you'll forget that you did see it.Our heroine from the first film and the countless video games, Lara Croft (Jolie), is now on a quest to find the mythical Pandora's Box. For some reason or another, she has to go to China, Hong Kong, and Africa, while riding a shark, riding a motorbike on the Great Wall of China, and fighting on a high-rise building. Along the way, she partners with former criminal Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) for some unknown reason (considering everyone in this movie has an accent, it's hard to tell what they're saying most of the time. Also, the parts in between the action weren't that exciting.)The action scenes weren't the best, but one scene really stood out. During it, I thought `green screen and wires,' but it was still pretty impressive. Then, after I saw it, I read that the stunts were actually real. The scene I'm talking about is when Lara and Sheridan sky dive off of the 81st floor of a building, using some sort of convoluted parachute thing. It was pretty amazing to see it happen. One of the best stunts of the year.Of course, the good goes to the bad. The dialogue was lame. They seemed to just try to get from one exotic location to another. Not that the locations were bad or anything, but maybe if Jan de Bont (who can produce hits like Speed and misses like Speed 2) had had some more intelligent dialogue added in, then it wouldn't have been so bad in between the semi-good action scenes.Now, let me gripe about the characterization. What characterization, you may ask. I say, exactly. A few characters from the first film pop up now and again, but since I didn't remember them (I haven't seen the first one for two years), I didn't care about them. What really bothered me, though, is not how I didn't know anything about any characters they talked about, but when characters, large ones, just popped in from out of nowhere. For example, when Lara is going to Africa, she parachutes down into the exact automobile that someone she had known before was driving. That man is important for the last part, but he just randomly popped up.If you can get past the absurdity of shark riding and mystical creatures that never sleep, then you just may like Tomb Raider 2. If you stick on the important parts of movies, then you'll find many faults.My rating: 5/10Rated PG-13 for action violence and some sensuality.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

A collosal bore of a film that almost put me to sleep, Jolie sleepwalks through the film, displaying not one iota of genuine human emotion, and the supporting cast of lunkheads is just worthless..

66,buiger,Just stop thinking and enjoy...,6,20 July 2006,"One way or another, I disagree with most critics on this film. With some because I don't think that the movie is as bad as they claim, and with others because I don't think it is better than the first one. It is in my opinion simply a decent, relaxing and entertaining video-game-turned-movie. I think most people will enjoy it, provided they switch their brain to the ""OFF"" position. But what's wrong with that? There is no use musing about the preposterous, unrealistic and downright ridiculous situations in the film, because as I said before, this is just a video-game-turned-movie, and in computer games, everything is possible.In other, Jolie is once again excellent as Lady Croft (if only some of the modern day male 'Bond actors' where only half as good and convincing in their roles...), totally believable in this otherwise very difficult role to play for a woman. On the flip side, this film has been centered more towards the James Bond motif rather than the Indiana Jones motif and that did not work to its advantage. What I found to be best in the first film was the very good balance found between these two angles, utilizing in a way 'the best of both worlds'. 'The cradle of life' overdoes it in only one direction, and it is a lesser film because of it.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
67,christian123,"Pretty Good, If All You Want Is A Brainless Action Movie",4,1 July 2005,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life is an improvement over the original as it delivers more action and adventure. Archaeologist and explorer extraordinaire, Lara Croft, journeys to a temple which has sunken underwater in search of lost treasures. During her expedition, Croft happens upon a sphere that contains the mythical Pandora's Box, only to have it stolen from her by Chen Lo, the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate. Chen Lo is in league with a bad guy named Reiss, who wants to use the priceless Box as a doomsday weapon. The plot sounds okay but the main reason someone would see this film is for the action scenes and Angelina Jolie. People just wanting those two things will probably enjoy this film. People that want a good story and better direction should skip this film. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. However, the story is weak and the film doesn't quite make sense at times either. I think the person that should be blamed is Jan de Bont. He is a terrible director and can't build up suspense very well. He did a bit better then Simon West but still the studio should have hired someone else. The acting is good not great but nothing horrible either. Angelina Jolie does a good job of playing Lara Croft and she is also very breathtaking in the film. Gerard Butler does a good job as well though sometimes his performance wasn't very interesting. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. Another problem I had with this film is that it gets boring at times. Having a lot of action doesn't mean its audience will be entertained. The movie's running time is 117 minutes which is a bit longer then the original. I think they could have cut the film down to about the same length as there some pointless scenes. If you hated the original then you should skip this film as the film is more of the same but it is more entertaining. As long as you don't try to notice too many of the mistakes in the film then you should enjoy it. If your looking for a serious action flick then just skip this.

68,bh_tafe3,Strong leads can't quite save a mediocre film,5,28 June 2014,"A strong performance from Gerard Butler and genuine chemistry with his co star Angelina Jolie can't quite save this from being a poor man's sequel to an average original.Angelina returns as Lara Croft and is straight into a bikini in this rather telling omen of things to come. After her base is captured and her helpers (Chris Barrie and Noah Taylor also back for a second helping) held hostage, so poor Lara is forced to enlist the help of former lover and charming rogue Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler) to find the Cradle of Life, a mystical ancient relic that is capable of solving all of her problems. Jolie and Butler have genuine chemistry and run away from a few cool set pieces, make out on a boat and generally have the only worthwhile character interactions in this movie. The ending does pack quite a punch and was probably a little bleak for some.Djimon also comes along for the ride while Ciaran Hinds is a pretty unremarkable baddie straight off a production line. Director Jan de Bont, the much derided Twister helmer, does a decent job of the action sequences, but doesn't illicit anything of value from his minor players. In the end the audience is left with Jolie and Butler to keep them interested, but any good will from that is lost by the unsettling conclusion.It's not awful, but not up to the only average standard set by the original.

Note her partnering here with a 'rogue Scot'. ""Mission Impossible 2"" and ""Point Break"" are thrown in for good measure.This falls flat because of the deadly dull seriousness, and the absence of any sex appeal. It amounts to a spoof in all of its manifold allusive features, yet it generates no laughs. Jolie needed to play this with a wink at the audience, but got it completely wrong.The other missing dimension is the lack of acknowledgment that this is, at its root, a game.

The action scenes are perhaps the most dull you'll see this year, and the always entertaining Jolie sleepwalks through the picture.

The film is actually about Lara and Terry's relationship which unfortunately creates a very poor setting for an action film and therefore it has never stood on its own as a fun, little, brain-free adventure film like its predecessor.The film's main problem is its length and the sheer amount of redundant action or rather stunt-sequences. These do not advance the plot and just drag the film out for unnecessarily long. This becomes evident in the Africa Chapter where the film seems very rushed in places. Additional complaints include the Shadow Guardians looking way too much like Rancors from Return of the Jedi, as well as the shark, which looks fake.Beyond that the film does possess a compelling story and that dry but light-hearted humour which works for both action and Bond films.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
75,simon_booth,Disappointing,5,30 July 2003,"What are the qualifications for becoming a Hollywood script writer I wonder? Certainly the ability to tell an interesting, coherent or intelligent story isn't one of them.  But hey, it's an action movie right... aren't the scripts for action movies *supposed* to be stupid?  The law of the movie world seems to be that the bigger the budget the more cheese and corn the script should contain, and the less narrative logic.I actually liked the first Tomb Raider movie a fair bit - it was great to see Lara Croft in an autonomous adventure, and Angelina Jolie fit the character perfectly - smart, sexy, athletic and tough.  Jolie is still a joy to watch in the sequel, but in every other respect the sequel is inferior to the original (much as every successive version of the game has been worse than the last - poor Lara has been in steady decline since she was born in 1995).  The biggest problem with the film was that the producers/writers evidently didn't have confidence in Lara/Jolie to carry the film by herself, so they brought in the totally unnecessary love interest/conflict/side-kick and gave half of the film to him.  The big Scottish guy wasn't bad at all, but the film would have been 5 times better if it'd just focussed on Lara raiding tombs and kicking ass.  If they really needed a major male character, they should have focussed on a better and more developed villain - the charismatic Simon Yam should have been the main bad guy, and given a lot more screen time and motivation (and the chance to deliver at least some of his lines in Cantonese, since his English isn't too hot).Anyway, script and character issues aside for the moment, what matters most in a summer action film is spectacle, and the film delivers some impressive action moments.  The shoot-out & escape from the underwater temple near the beginning is unfortunately the best it gets though (though one has to wonder how the atmosphere in a temple that had been underwater for 2000+ years was perfectly breathable?).   The action is generally pretty generic though - nothing ever comes close to the cool or excitement of the bungee-rope scenes of the first film.  Actually the best moments of the film are those when it most resembles the (first) game - Lara Croft using her athletic moves to scale walls and statues.  That's the sort of thing they should concentrate on in the next film, assuming that one gets made.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

77,gengar843,Sometimes a FIlm Plays All Its Cards Correctly,9,10 May 2015,"As you may be aware, this film is fictional, and therefore I will not be speaking to whether sharks growl, or if black acid pools exist.What I will be saying is that a film doesn't have to be a national treasure in order to be top-notch. All it has to do is play its cards correctly.Female heroine. Superb. She's not jaded, not a feminist, and she's a romantic. VERY unique in the world of film where women heroes are supposed to out-man the man. She's tough, clever, smart, worldly, well-connected, great-looking, and still has a soft spot for the skyline of Hong Kong.Male anti-hero. Nicely held together. Gerard Butler is absolutely smashing here, never better. His repartee with Lara is simple but high on the keen level, so kudos to the screenwriter. As Lara, skilled, connected, and just a bit flawed in the moral department makes Terry ripe for his own death.The action. The pace on this film is on par with almost any James Bond movie. The lulls are few and contain interesting scenery, mainly travelogue. We go to Africa, Greece, and China, on location. Jolie's prowess is truly on display, martial arts, weaponry, horseback, climbing, acrobatics. While some aspects feel rushed, most are just right. The stunts are tremendous and hardly anything looks fake, even if it is a movie.The plot. A bit thin after the initial setup. Mostly, this is a chase and be chased film. Some Bond, some Bourne, some Indiana Jones. The villain is centered correctly, only becoming unhinged at the very end. I think Reiss' toughness was overrated and the finale fight with Lara was about 30 seconds too long, since she is obviously superior in every way to his wild gunslinging. The orb was QUITE interesting, and the Greek mythology mixed with origins of life was, of course, a rip from The Lost Ark, among others. This was not distracting, actually, as there is little to go wrong when a plot centers around, essentially, the power of God.Special Effects. The guardians of the canyon were fun and slight, just right for this type of film, intense but not evil enough to spill this to demonic. Their movements were exciting, and the way they guard/kill quite interesting, by absorbing the humans into the terrain. The box itself was somewhat of an anticlimax, not being opened long enough to produce havoc.Dialogue. Not riveting, but not boring or annoying. A straight shot.Is Alien a better franchise?

I'm surprised by the relatively negative reviews others have given it.  Usually I'm in sync with most people on these things, but I enjoyed this one.The story is a basic Indiana Jones adventure.  Laura Croft uncovers an orb in a lost tomb, Alexander's Lunar Temple, and when a certain musical tone is played, the orb reveals the location of Pandora's Box.  An evil scientist hires someone to steal it - he wants to release a plague to wipe out most of the world's population and leave everything to him and a select few.  Laura Croft sets out to recover the orb and prevent anyone from getting to Pandora's Box.As befits a director who made his bones in cinematography, Jan de Bont made a film with lots of stimulating visuals.  The scene of the two jumping off a highrise in Hong Kong and parasailing to a ship in the harbor was really impressive.  There's a fair amount of CGI, but with all the stunts and action, it was necessary and I didn't find them intrusive.  The actual cinematographer here is David Tattersall, who filmed the last Bond movie and the newer Star War releases.Angelina Jolie is just a fair actress, but she handles the role of a heroic action figure well enough and certainly fills out the physical requirements. Gerard Butler and Ciarán Hinds, though not well known by name, also play their roles as Laura's partner/maybe-love-interest and evil villain well.The production isn't quite as slick as a Bond movie and de Bont certainly isn't Steven Spielberg, but I found this movie more enjoyable than ""Die Another Day.""

Not so here. The amusing assistant has been replaced by a couple of teenage computer geeks with no personality whatsoever. And the bad guy...oh jeez. He reminded me of a corporate middle-manager with a slight case of constipation, which is to say, a tad cranky.But how about the story? Well, I really don't think there is one. Lara finds a sphere, which is promptly stolen by the boring bad guy. She tries to get it back and there's a gigantic shootout with lots of gymnastics and high flying junk, I'm sure you know the drill. She tries again to get it back, and we have the same gigantic shootout yadda yadda yadda. Then there's a big sword fight that seems nothing but an excuse to break a bunch of statues apart. Then there's the attack of the killer CGI thingies. They eventually dissolve in a tornado of pixels. I mean, were they even trying AT ALL to make these things look like something other than a computer generated special effect? But how about the scenery? The original at least had lots of interesting locations. Not here. At one point in the movie, they go to ""The most remote mountain range in all of China"". And guess what? There's a delivery truck parked out front. I mean, come on. They wind up on the Serengeti plains, which look like nothing more than a dry wasteland. They go to some Asian city, which looks no different than any other large city on the face of the earth.And just to add insult to injury, it didn't appear to me that Jolie was even wearing her gigantic padded bra through most of this film.Overall, if you're interested in seeing this, just rent the original and watch it again.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

All I can say is that there was nothing good about this film in and of itself.  Seriously, nothing.To begin with, the direction is awful.  OK, Angelina Jolie is a very pretty woman.  Still, is it necessary that 1/2 of the movie be nothing but a close-up of her?  Combined with another 1/4 of the movie being close-ups of Russell Crowe look-alike Gerard Butler, and there's already a big problem. This is not what great action movies are made of.  Especially considering that Jolie appears to have only one facial expression throughout most of the film.The character of Lara Croft was badly written.  She's intensely dislikeable. I never felt any sympathy for this character at all.  Perhaps Jolie's wooden acting contributed to this.  ""Acting"" is a term I use loosely here, since it doesn't appear that the script called upon her to do any of it.The movie also lacks entirely in originality.  Much of it seemed lifted from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Swap Africa for the Middle East and the 1930's for the present day and you've pretty much got the same film.  It's entirely predictable, from start to finish.  What didn't come from ""Raiders"" came from ""The Mummy.""When you meet character Terry Sheridan in his prison cell, there's no problem figuring out how the movie will end.  None at all. Yawn.A few technical notes that make this a good candidate if there's ever a revival of Mystery Science Theater 3000:1. The ""most remote mountainous region in China"" is not 35 miles outside of Shanghai.  That's like saying that the suburbs of Washington DC are the most remote part of Virginia.2. For a villain who we're told ""has no agenda,"" Reiss sure seems to have a lot to say about his agenda.3. You cannot slide down a rope headfirst from a mountain with your bare hands and not get rope burn.4. There is more than one shark in the Meditteranean, despite this movie insisting something to the contrary.  Punching a shark in the nose does not mean it will let you ride it, and it definitely doesn't mean it will head straight for the surface.  Kids, don't try this at home.All in all, this film is a complete waste of time, unless you're really dying to see Angelina Jolie in a wet suit... and that scene, a few minutes into ""Cradle of Life,"" is as good as this one gets.I laughed out loud at several points in ""Cradle of Life;"" not because the film meant to be funny, but because it was laugh-out-loud bad.

82,Jexxon,"Raiders of the Lost Ark... I mean, Box",1,6 February 2005,"Pointless sequel to the not so successful first film. The story is basically a rehash of the original, with slightly less supernatural stuff, but more unnecessary violence. The plot, involving a globe that shows the location of Pandora's Box, is just an excuse to go from one action scene to the next.There are a lot of plot holes though: Growling sharks, secret labs located in the middle of a shopping mall, the question of why anyone would want to open Pandora's Box since it brings misfortune to those who does, and the fact that nobody knows the location of said box, except of course, an entire tribe living next door to it...The first film was pretty bad, but compared to this disaster it was better in all departments. Jan de Bont is obviously just a 1.5-hit wonder (Twister is still pretty good) and he fails to do anything exciting with Cradle of Life. It's tired dialouge, clichéd characters, boring action pieces, and a slow pace where nothing really happens.Angelina Jolie was by far the best thing with the original, but here she too lacks any sense of being happy to be back (read, contractual obligation).

Circumstances being what they were, and having seen just about all the releases available one particular week, I decided to give the first Tomb Raider a look.  To my surprise, I was one of those who found it more than mildly entertaining, thanks in large part to the fact that I felt Angeline Jolie had somehow managed not only to bring a video and computer game character to the screen with a bit of flair, but to also give that character a bit of complexity and depth.  Not an easy task by no means.  It wasn't the best adventure film I had ever seen, by any standards but it was passable. It was because of this that I looked forward to see if Jan De Bont would be able to improve on the promise of the original in Cradle of life.  As it turned out, Cradle of Life wasn't any worse, but it wasn't an improvement either.  Kind of disappointing when you consider how much of an opportunity there was to explore the character even greater and give her more depth. With the hokey poky sub-plot of Lara's missing father dispensed in the first film, you would have thought that this would have freed Lara up to carry the sequel without any personal demons invading the plot.  Alas, it is not to be, as the writers found it necessary to introduce the character of Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), who happens to be not only an imprisoned mercenary, but also a lover from Lara's past.  Lara no longer trusts Mr. Sheridan, but needs him to get her into China and help her find the Orb that will lead her to Pandora's box.  This plot twist also gives us one of those whose side is he really on plot twists that of course won't be resolved until the end of the movie.  This all would have been OK except that the past relationship between Lara and Terry is never dealt with enough to give us any reason for it.  This is one time a few quick flashbacks might have helped make the film a bit more interesting and the ending as it turns out, more suspenseful. Laura's companions Bryce and Hilary are back also.  Their parts have been whittled down considerably in this film and they are quite a bit less interesting than before.  Ciaran Hinds is on hand as Jonathan Reiss, the villain who is in search of Pandora's box also for the usual diabolical reasons that could destroy mankind.  He is evil enough but in the end not a particularly smart villain.  I found Iain Glenn as Manfred Powell in the first film to more of an adversary.  If you're going to make sequels I think the first rule should be make the adversary more evil, more intelligent and more diabolical than any of those that came before.  Any video game player could have told the writers that. Jan De Bont's direction keeps the film moving at a rapid pace.  This is good to the point where it doesn't give us time to dwell on the silliness of what's going on, but it's bad because he should have taken the time to bring more depth to the character of Lara Croft or delved deeper into her relationship with Terry which may have been enough.  Angeline Jolie should be given a lot of credit.  She does manage to take a computer generated icon and breathe life into her, something that is not an easy task.  It's a shame, because I would have liked to seen what she could do as Lara, if given a chance to explore the character even more.  I don't know if there will be another sequel, and I won't particularly miss the Lara Croft films if there isn't.  I will miss Angeline Jolie as the Lara Croft character though.  Guess you can't have everything, can you?My Grade: C+",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
84,TheEtherWalk,Entertaining (possible spoilers),8,6 August 2003,"In Tomb Raider 2, Lara Croft sets out to find the Cradle of Life, the supposed resting place of Pandora's Box. Also looking for the box is a terrorist, who wants it because he believes it contains a master virus capable of devastating most of the world. Meanwhile, a 14K Triad (well, not exactly a Triad, but close enough) has acquired one of the keys to the location of the box, a golden orb. The terrorist eventually obtains it, after Lara and an ex-con who is helping her kill most of the Triad members. Lara eventually gets the orb back, but the bad guys find out where the box is because they picked up her little eye-communicator and kidnapped Bryce, her associate. Lara and the bad guys arrive in Africa (the now revealed home of Pandora's Box) and Lara employs a native tribe to help her find the Cradle. The natives are killed however by a group of marines, under the employment of the terrorist. They take Lara and Terry, the ex-con, through a mountain passage to a dark place with these SICK looking shadow-monsters, who wipe out most of the marines before Lara stops them with the orb.
I won't give away too much of the ending, but it's actually pretty emotional. This is a great movie, one of the best of the summer. The CGI is amazing, save for the shark-battle scene which was laughable. Highlights include the Shadow-monsters, the acid bath and the gunfights between the Triad, the terrorists and Lara. Don't listen to all the bashers! This movie rocks!",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
85,travisimo,Sexy Woman in a Very Bad Movie,2,6 December 2003,"First off I should note that I've never seen the first Tomb Raider, and I had no desire to see either Tomb Raider movies.  I've never played the game, and the whole premise of these movies seemed dumb to me.  However, my parents saw the first one, liked it, and wanted to see this.  Seeing as how pickings were slim at the video store, we rented it.  But hey, I'm willing to give anything a shot.Well, this movie met my expectations, maybe even exceeded them  that this movie would be awful.  The only positive thing I could carry out of this movie was that Angelina Jolie was fun to look at.  However, I was informed that she dressed more provocatively in the first one.  So I felt gypped on the only somewhat positive aspect of this movie!So moving past Jolie's looks, I found the story to be incredibly boring.  I could not get into it for one second.  None of the characters' personalities were appealing at all.  I couldn't care less for Gerard Butler's character whom Lara Croft bailed out of prison.  I guess this guy was supposed to be one of the main characters, but there couldn't be enough back-story or depth to this character for me to give an ounce of attention to him.  Then again, this is all based on a video game, so how deep can it really be?As for the character of Lara Croft herself, I absolutely despise characters that seem to be perfect in every way.  Not only is she beautiful, but also she's a know-it-all archaeologist who lives in a mansion and possesses the ultimate fighting skills.  That's just boring and lazy.  Hey, Indiana Jones was afraid of snakes and named himself after the dog.  That gives a sense of humor and likeability to the character.  There's nothing at all appealing about Lara Croft except that she looks good in a wetsuit.As you can see, I hated this movie.  This goes on my list of the all-time worst.  I know I'm not alone on this, and I don't think we'll ever see another Lara Croft movie.  What a shame!My IMDB Rating: 2/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: D- (Truly Awful)",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
86,Ishallwearpurple,Pretty people in pretty places doing impossible things----,6,12 May 2005,"With tongue firmly in cheek, the story of this film is a series of preposterous events, but what are we to expect of a game made into a movie? Angelina Jolie is Lady Lara Croft, and is stunning in her skin tight gray diving suit. Ciaran Hinds (Phantom Of The Opera) is the villain, a scientist bent on getting his hands on the Pandora's box containing the essence of all evil, in order to rule the world. Lara is having none of that, and enlists her former partner Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler - The Phantom) to help find it and keep it away from evil doers.There are some wonderful set pieces throughout the film as with the underwater temple; Lara arriving at the boat to start the expedition on a jet ski (wowser!); the shark to the rescue (huh?); the sub to the rescue (double huh?). More: at the Croft mansion the kung fu; the sidesaddle horse riding while shooting at targets (wow!); at the prison getting Terry released - her in her white fur amid all that filth; Terry doing pull ups dripping sweat; Terry looking down from his bars saying ""Croft"" in just the right way to let us know this is one dangerous hombre. And his devastating comment to Lara ""I AM Charming"" and isn't he just? The motorcycle race between Lara and Terry across the great wall in China was fun. Him telling her ""don't look at my ass"" as they climb a hill was cute and funny.The famous sex scene is so reversed - she is the one in charge and he ends up her prey and victim - is one for the books. Nice eye candy for all of us out here in the real world.That's the good stuff. There are some strange choices made by the director (or whoever?) A wedding celebration on the edge of a precipice to show the quake at the beginning? Lots of money for what purpose - didn't add anything for me. The upside-down gunfight as Lara and Terry escape once again. Sorry, the thrill is gone and it bombed.Simon Chow is good and in his Hong Kong films a real menace - but here was wasted. Croft running up the car shooting - a la Chow Yun Fat in some of his 1980's films - is blatant 'borrowing.' All the shooting out of glass in the office building - a la ""Die Hard"" - been there done that.AND!!! What is with the Shadow Guardians in the last fourth of film. We go from sort of realism filtered through game playing mentality into science fiction. Blech! Lame! Cinematography is gorgeous and some of the sound track music is fine. Overall a more good than bad - 7/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
87,thomvic,The Cradle of Life is mainly alive for visual effects and locations.....,6,21 August 2010,"For those who liked the first Tomb Raider movie - this is probably a better option in terms of it being plain fun and a no brainer. For those who hated the first one - you're most likely not gonna like this any better.The first film's main flaw was the fact that Lara Croft was such a stuck up character with overconfidence so there was no danger of her being in trouble anyway. What's more, why the hell didn't those people who made the triangle destroy it rather than split it up? Yeesh.The sequel has a bit of those problems which I won't give away, in terms of plot holes and common sense. What it does have is great stunts, a great Lara Croft in Jolie and exotic locations ranging from Hong Kong, Greece and Africa.Jolie is as beautiful as ever, yet she seems a bit polished too much in this one so she is quite plastic in most scenes. The main problem is that this film is way too fast paced, so for example in one scene, they discover they have to go to Hong Kong - next scene, they are already there. I mean, they could have shown a bit of the efforts they went to to get there. It's as though the filmmakers wanted to simply rush the plot in order to get from one exotic location to another.Also, it does feel like a bit of an excuse just to show off stunts and nice locations, so the plot is extremely thin. They have to save the world from bad guys who want to use Pandara's Box to unleash some havic evil....yeah that sounds like what most bad guys wanna do. Another saving the world from bad guy scenario. What is also disappointing is that the villains in this movie feel so boring and aren't scary at all.Gerard Butler plays a pretty limited role in this and is outshined by Jolie. His buffed up physique is pretty much all he has going in this and there is not great chemistry between the two who are supposed to be ex lovers in the story.Pretty much this movie is a really glossy travel brochure with moving images. That's how it plays out and feels like. It makes itself look beautiful, but has a lack of substance. So to be honest, the first film, despite its major flaws, actually felt like it had a more strong plot line since it actually focused on its development. This one sort of feels more like a cross between Indiana Jones crossed with a Super Mario Brothers plot line from one of the levels in the game.Just see it if you want a movie you don't have to think much about and one you will most likely forget about once it's over - but you'll enjoy the ride if you don't think too much which is what this film obviously wants you to do.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

90,mrskywalker,Mean Spirited,4,27 July 2003,"I  so looked forward to this film.  I liked the first one better than most people.  I thought this would be great. It started good with great scenery and powerful music.  Jolie commands the screen the best of all modern actresses.But as the film progresses we see changes to Lara.  After she stabs one guy in the foot she smiles and says ""nice"" etc..  She is kind of sadistic and is not the hero of the first.  Naturally the villain is middle aged British. But he seems no match for her so no real conflict.  The worst part is bringing in a ex boyfriend making this soap opera time.  The heavy graphic kissing scene is definately not for youngsters and so out of place. I thought it would pick up at the end but it ended with a dud.  I am a croft fan and I wanted so much more.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
91,mrskywalker,Say it is not so,4,31 July 2003,"I liked the first one and expected this to be even much better.  But Lara has been invaded by an attempt to be more realistic with an ex boyfriend involved.  The worst part is her change in personality.  She laughs when she hurts people.  She says nice in pleasure when she stabs someone's foot.  She laughs when she hits someone in the head.  She slashes someone just for the hell of it and smiles. She tells her friends ""why am I bothering to discuss it with you.""  She tells some partner secret agents that they are dummies because they wear soft suits with soft hands.  This is how she treats her friends which does not make her strong as perhaps feminists might think.  She has a bad attitude toward everyone accept Africans which I suppose is politically correct.  The Africans she smiles at and talks to like real people. Her partners are humiliated for no reason near the end.The problem with this film is not realism.  Who wants realism in a super hero movie.  The problem is Lara is kind of a jerk in this film.  Even the android Arnold plays in the great great Terminator 3 has more honor.  There is also no real challenge from the villain especially at the end where it should be in Tomb Raider 2.  This could be so great with more nobility and honor.  It does not compare with Die Another Day.  Although even Bond had a few bad movies in which he was made too sadistic.  Bond is back but Lara needs to improve next time.We may have many Tomb Raiders which would be great with Lara as an honorable hero.  Jolie has great potential for a few more films but hopefully with no jerk convict love interest and please no more political correctness. Drop these boyfriend problems in Charlie's Angels and now Tomb Raider.   Cut out the soap opera stuff and perhaps 20 years from now Tomb Raider movies may still be going perhaps even with new actresses.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
92,parhat,I had to forced fed myself 10 times to finish watching this,3,20 October 2005,"Tomb Raider in terms of technical things, such as special effect, cinematography, music, camera (no shaking), location, action adventure, costume designs, is near perfect. The problem is the story fails badly on three things:1. Casting 2. Editing 3. StoryCasting. Terry Sheridan - what chemistry? Rust chemistry. Too much relationship overtones terrible mix. He talks too much without any meanings, undertones. In other words the script relates nothing to the pace of the story. Oh yes, all Directors understand the pace of the story, but the don't understand that the script MUST MATCH THE PACE OF THE STORY. If the script aren't razor tight concise, to the plot or the story, then cut it out from the story. I can name 90% of the script to remove, and most of it is Terry Sheridan. His accent is too thick, too obnoxious, talks too much. It irritates the viewers. The biggest mistake a script can make is when the script or the character irritates the viewers. It can really turn off the movie and by god, I bought this movie for a year and have struggled so badly to finish movie at least 10 times. I just went to sleep after 15 minutes. Something is seriously wrong with the movie!!!The second casting: the scientist. This scientist doesn't convince you much about why he does what he does. It falls flat on believability as to why he does what he does. Even the looking of the watch was not even convincing. The entire plane scene can be edited OUT! Give the guy more mystery like James Bond Spector.The third casting: Shen Lo. What? Who? Why? Enemies if they don't appear evil enough should not be cast. Somehow this enemy is not convincing. Compare the enemies of Robocop 1. Wow! How about the bad guys from the Joker in Batman. Wow! To solve this casting issue, I suggest a convincing screen play that you use the Joker, Two faced in Batman or something as a starting point. If it is not better than I suggest you redo it until you can come up with a truly evil bad guy making it entertaining to watch. All actors are ""washed out"" lacked unique characters. Now look at the uniqueness of character in Minority Report - wow! 2. Editing. Half of the story can be edited because the script spoils the pace of the story. This is especially true in the first 30 minutes of the movie.3. Story. People expect Tomb Raider to do one thing and one thing only. Tomb Raiding. Where is that? Flying over Hong Kong? Flying in Stealth Plane over China? Motorcycling? Pandora's Box - good concept. But why? The story has little weight in why we need to pursue them. YOU need solid reason why you need to pursue them, without it, forget it. Now look at Dr. Strangelove. There was a solid reason why this incident can and should happen. The plot reveals it quite clearly. But where is the weight in pursuing Pandora's box? Is there such thing as peekaboo into a Pandora's Box?The script should closely follow the plot. It doesn't. The word should be memorable or stick in the head. It doesn't. If you want a good story, one writer should write the plot and story board and another one should write the memorable words and script that makes the story work. Apparently it is messy on two counts.I am a big fan of Angelina Jolie and Tomb Raider and still think Cyborg 2 is a wonderful movie, but all her later films are just flops. I can't blame the actress, we just have a bad writer who don't know the power of words and a convincing story line and the director who doesn't seem to read the scripts.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
93,filmbuff-36,"Not great, but still an okay mindless diversion",6,31 July 2003,"The first `Tomb Raider' did not impress me very much. But then, movies based on video games do not have a very successful track record at the box office. Remember `Super Mario Bros.,' `Street Fighter' or `Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within'? Me neither.So while `Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life' still fits neatly within this sub-genre, it is a marked improvement over the previous film. While it is still mostly action mixed with witty banter and more then just a hint of sensuality, the characters are given a decent chance to breathe in between the action sequences, allowing for that oh-so-bothersome thing called plot to pop up now and then.Angelina Jolie reprises her role as Lara Croft, the world famous English archeologist/adventurer. We start our saga with Croft stumbling upon the Luna Temple of Alexander, which has been submerged off the coast of Greece for millennia. While snooping about, a group of thugs also enter the temple and steal a mysterious gold orb, nearly killing Croft in the process.She later discovers that the orb is an artifact that leads to the resting space of Pandora's Box, the receptacle that, according to Greek legend, supposedly held all good and evil within it before Pandora opened it. The box supposedly contains an uncurable plague, which interests Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds), a bioterrorist specializing in selling communicable diseases and other blights to interested parties.Croft is soon hired by the British government to track down Reiss and stop his plans to spread the plague, and she in turn recruits Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a traitorous former British SAS operative turned mercenary who has had past dealing with the Chinese gang that stole the golden orb. Like most films of this kind, Croft has a past with Sheridan, which gives the story its romantic angle.From here, the film tries to follow the `Indiana Jones' formula step-by-step. Croft and Sheridan travel the globe playing cat-and-mouse with Reiss and his goons. There are shootouts, chases, fist fights and other acts of juvenile fantasy fullfillment, all done with Croft wearing her impossibly tight clothing, bringing life to the lustful wishes of many teenage fanboys.Jan de Bont is a much more accomplished director then Simon West, which helps explain why this sequel is a superior film. De Bont sets up his action scenes smoothly, and you can actually tell what is happening on screen this time around. Also, Croft is actually given a chance to develop her character during this go-around. It's clear that she has actually learned a thing or two about life during her adventures, and even manages to come out of this tale a little less ignorant about the dangers of digging up the past.But despite the improvements in the film making this time, the basic shortcoming that affects films such as this will be that no matter how loyal the movie stays to the game it's based on, it will never replace the spectacle of actually playing the game itself. As good looking as Jolie is packing duel 9 mms while spandex clings to her curvaceous body, it can't compete against the sheer thrill of being in control of Lara Croft herself.The movie is an okay popcorn thriller filled with some suspenseful sequences and decent action set pieces, but in the end it just feels like a dress rehearsal for the upcoming fourth `Indiana Jones' movie. As good as de Bont and Jolie are, here's hoping Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford will come along in 2005 and show these youngsters how it's really done.6 out of 10 stars. Fun, but still just a pale imitation of the real top archeologist/adventurer that we all know and love.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

95,TimBoHannon,A Shoddy Script Lowlights an Inadequate Movie,4,5 April 2008,"I walked out of my local cinema on June 15, 2001 satisfied with the first Tomb Raider film. Naturally, I had similar expectations when I saw the sequel, directed by Jan de Bont. I instantly noticed that ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" starts badly. The title card is shown on water just as it is in another de Bont misfire, ""Speed 2: Cruise Control."" Apparently both de Bont and the Lara Croft producers enjoy using colons in their movie titles. If they make a third one, perhaps the colon will be right before the last word of an even longer title.An earthquake off the coast of Santorini attracts Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), who believes a renowned but undiscovered sunken temple lies nearby. She gains entry but is soon attacked by Chen Lo (Simon Yam) and the Shay Ling. To escape, she slashes her arm to attract a shark, gives it a good punch in the nose, grabs its fin and rides it towards the surface.Back in 2300 B.C., a Pharaoh discovered Pandora's Box, which discharged a plague on his army upon being opened. Consequently hidden in India, it was rediscovered two millennia later by Alexander the Great, who returned it to its resting place in The Cradle of Life. However, he left a map in the form of a glowing orb.Chen Lo now has possession of the map and intends to sell it to Jonathan Reiss, the world's foremost creator of biological weapons and ""a modern day Dr. Mengele."" Terrified of that prospect, MI6 asks Lara to repossess it from Lo before he can complete the sale; she insists on recruiting the help of untrustworthy traitor Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler).Reiss is not interested in ruling the world, he simply enjoys deciding who lives and dies. Sheridan once worked for Chen Lo's gang, so naturally he can lead Lara to them. It is here that writer Steven E. DeSouza completely defies logic. Sheridan knows where the Shay Ling make office, so why not send in an army or bomb the place? The Chinese government may object, but it would not be difficult to convince the world that China cannot be trusted with a supreme biological weapon. Alternatively, they can easily follow Reiss and clean his clock once he takes possession of the orb.Later on, Lara comes face to face with the map while Reiss' computers are decoding it. All she must do to end the threat is shoot it a few times. She already has enough evidence for her government to arrest or assassinate Reiss. When she decodes it, it merely projects an image of a peaceful African prairie. There are millions of square miles that fit that visual. Besides, does it really take a genius to figure out that an Egyptian probably found it in Africa?! Of course, she immediately knows it is Mt. Kilimanjaro.I can forgive all of those follies if the rest of the film entertains, but that is another area where it does not quite clear the bar on the pole vault. Lara has one fistfight. While it is longer, it is no match for her duel with Manfred Powell during the climax of the first film. Jan de Bont directed many harrowing scenes in ""Speed"" and had a few acceptable ones in the middle act of its sequel. His work here is boring. One is a motorcycle race with no pursuers. Later, Lara and Terry are sliding headfirst down ropes and shooting a bunch of goons I didn't know were there. When they meet the Shay Ling, their hands are bound in front with enough of a neat space in between for Lara to fight. Of course, if their captors were smart and tied their arms behind them, there would be no escape, Lara would be murdered and the movie over. That scene needed restructuring before it was shot.What does work are the characters of Reiss and Sheridan. Hinds gives a good Hinds performance, but the role does not have the potential of being another Powell. The ambiguity of Sheridan's allegiance is the movie's strength, and both Butler and Jolie are good enough to make it impactful. The climax comes not when Reiss finds the Box, but right afterwards when something has to give between Lara and Terry.The gaming series had some wild artifacts such as the dagger that could kill a man and resurrect him as a dragon, and four treasures that transform a benevolent doctor into a huge magical spider. Using a real life myth takes the premise further than it can stretch. Without good direction or an adequate screenplay, the second Tomb Raider film fails and only scores a four of ten.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Second - Lara never sweats or anything usual or human.  I know she's supposed to be good, but there wasn't lots of humanity.  Maybe when she cried, but that seemed a little off, considering the situation.  She's beautiful and the movie was beautiful, just not a lot of depth.

97,23skidoo-4,Why do so many people hate this movie?,8,28 December 2003,"Although Cradle of Life won't go down in movie history as an all-time classic, I am mystified at why so many critics and moviegoers hated it.In my opinion, this movie is much better than the first Tomb Raider film. The first film was entertaining, make no mistake, but it still had too much of a comic book feel and 'Angelina Jolie' (qv) had not yet gotten a firm grasp of the Lara Croft role. In Cradle of Life, both Lara and Jolie show newfound maturation, and this makes her (both actress and fictional character) much more interesting to watch. Heck, even Jolie's faux British accent is more convincing the second time around. I was one of the many who protested when she was cast in the role; the first film left be unconvinced, but she finally won me over in her second outing.The story is also more interesting in the second film, with the whole Pandora's Box angle being something more worthy of Tomb Raider than the tired old ""conspiracy out to take over the world"" plot of the first film.There are some aspects of the second film that I didn't care for as much. Lara, for one thing, is far more deadlier this second time around and at one point seriously considers gunning down a man in cold blood. This type of behavior is more fitting for James Bond than Lady Lara Croft. But once I got used to the idea of Lara Croft 007, I didn't mind it so much. (Indeed, if Hollywood ever follows through with it's long-threatened female Bond film, they could do far worse than get Angelina Jolie for the role of Jane(?) Bond.)What appealed to me in Cradle of Life is how familiar Lara, her background, and her supporting characters have become with only one previous film under their belts. No time is spent explaining who she is and why she lives in such a huge mansion (which sadly appears only briefly). This level of familiarity, of character comfort, is something I've only ever seen once before -- in the Bond series.Cradle of Life also features some most impressive set pieces that may not necessarily advance the story, but are great to watch, such as a zoom in from outer space on Lara riding a motorcycle, an incredible zoom-in shot THROUGH the window of Croft Manor, and a great scene of Lara shooting at targets while riding a horse -- sidesaddle!Sadly, the critical and box office failure of Cradle of Life probably guarantees no further entries in the series, and even if it does continue, Jolie looks ready to follow Audrey Hepburn's lead and put acting on the back burner in favor of humanitarian work so the role will probably go to another (possibly less talented) actress. If this turns out to be the case, I believe the Lara Croft series looks set to be remembered as fondly as the Derek Flint films of the 1960s.Anyone who has been scared away by the bad reviews could do worse than to rent a copy from their local video store and check it out. You might be surprised at how much fun the movie is.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
98,SwingBatta,"This ""Cradle"" doesn't rock: Impassive sequel simply goes through the motions",7,24 July 2003,"The success of the unjustifiably maligned 2001 hit ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""  a record-breaking $48-million opening weekend and over $250 million worldwide in the coffers  apparently wasn't enough to placate the Paramount brass, hence the filmmakers' desperation in attempting to lure disenchanted viewers back to the multiplexes for the inevitable sequel. With this film, carrying the clunky subtitle ""The Cradle of Life,"" and directed by Jan De Bont of ""Speed"" fame, we're promised a better story, less reliance on action scenes, and deeper characterization. Lara (Angelina Jolie) discovers a glowing mythical orb hidden in a submerged, long-lost temple dedicated to Alexander the Great. It can lead its possessor to the legendary Pandora's Box, which is located deep in an African mountain known as The Cradle of Life. Pandora's Box wiped out Alexander's army and is still capable of unleashing mass destruction to this day. However, the orb is promptly stolen by Chen Lo (Simon Yam), a Chinese crime lord who in turn plans to sell it to Dr. Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds), a former Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bioterrorist. Lara learns of this dastardly deed from a pair of stiff-upper-lipped MI6 agents, who inform her that The Queen has requested Lara's services in stopping the bad guys. Lara's sarcastic response provides Jolie's best line: ""Well, now I have Her Majesty's permission."" One little problem, though  the only person who can ably assist Lara in her mission is Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), an ex-soldier turned ruthless mercenary who happens to be her former lover. Needless to say, she doesn't trust him any further than she can throw him.It's unfortunate that ""Cradle"" doesn't practice what it preaches. One thing to remember about making a sequel is that the plot shouldn't be a halfhearted carbon copy of its predecessor. Besides Lara's usual jumping around the globe in her attempt to stop a villain bent on world domination, one artifact again leads to another in the script penned by Dean Georgaris. Perhaps Jolie wanted Lara's love life to mirror her own, because the jilted-lover-turned-mercenary subplot is also rehashed. This angle worked out brilliantly in the original due to Daniel Craig's terrific performance, but Butler just falls flat here, and it's not just because his thick Scottish brogue impairs a majority of his lines. Considering how distrusting Lara is of Sheridan, there's a lack of suspense in their reluctant relationship, and little chemistry between Jolie and Butler. This translates into a passionless, unnecessary love scene that appears to have been thrown in solely to satisfy 14-year-old boys. De Bont's overwrought and underwhelming action scenes are fractured conglomerations of John Woo-style gunplay and Universal Studios stunt shows, thanks to cramped cinematography mixed with Kirk Petruccelli's cheap-looking sets, such as a market square in Shanghai and a petrified forest that bears a strong resemblance to the Forbidden Forest from the ""Harry Potter"" movies. Watching Lara ride a slow-moving neon sign across the tiny square while dodging enemy bullets hardly gets the heart pumping. She also pole-vaults onto a helicopter, parachutes into the backseat of a Jeep, and blindly crashes through glass doors with guns blazing, all while leaving the audience unmoved. Some scenes in ""Cradle"" are just plain absurd. While escaping from Chen Lo, who dresses as if he just stepped off the set of ""Boogie Nights,"" Lara and Sheridan rappel headfirst down a pair of ropes hanging off the edge of a cliff and proceed to pick off members of his gang with deadly accuracy, while the baddies, of course, couldn't hit air in an empty room. (If you can't hit a target that moves with all the speed of a funeral procession, then you probably deserve to get shot.) Our heroes land with nary a rope burn on any part of their bodies. De Bont's familiar overreliance on the bombastic, however, fails to do its job of covering up the bland characters. Jolie takes this poorly developed version of Lara too seriously this time around; while Lara remains bulletproof, gone are her humorous quirks and snappy dialogue. As a result, Jolie's performance lacks any sense of originality and spontaneity, as do those of companion Butler and adversary Hinds; the only memorable aspect of cliched megalomaniac Reiss is his collection of impeccable suits.
It's worth noting that one of the writers who worked on the story is Steven E. de Souza, who tainted the ""Street Fighter"" video game series with the 1994 bomb of the same name. Five years later, he submitted a script for the first ""Tomb Raider,"" but it was rejected. While de Souza may have benefited from a second chance, this middle-of-the-pack movie won't be as fortunate. I didn't hate ""Cradle of Life,"" because I believe the filmmakers honestly tried to craft a quality sequel. But if there's any remaining hope for this wilting franchise, Pandora's Box will have to be unearthed again in order to find it.  7/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
99,Alan-40,Plenty of Meaningless Action,6,28 February 2004,"Proof yet again that video games don't make good movies.  The plot -- such as it is -- is designed to stretch out one hugely visible stunt after another with no depth of feeling whatsoever.   As with any video game, the wounds and scars that result from any action disappear by the time the next stunt starts.Angelina Jolie does her best to present a tough.aloof bitch with a softer side, but it is never developed enough to make it interesting.  (At least they deflated the padding a bit for this one.) Croft always seems to have access to some resourceful, local, long-time-friend who just happens to have been polishing her weaponry and transportation right up to the minute she happens to show up in the remote location where they live.A little bit of James Bond, a little bit of Indiana Jones, a rip-off here or there -- so what.  The fact is that for some of us it is no fun to see Alexander's ancient temple full of artifacts destroyed within minutes of its discovery.  You would think that a dedicated archaeologist like Lady Croft would have one line of regret over that but instead you get the same reaction that the Bush administration had over the destruction of the Baghdad museum.  (Just a bunch of old clay pots.)  Things like that undermine any identification with the Croft character that you otherwise might have.Even the sets themselves don't seem to care very much.  The temple in the opening sequence, in spite of being under the sea for thousands of years, has plenty of breathable air and is slightly cleaner than the modern Hong Kong shopping mall that appears later.  Nothing seems to have very much value.If you like big-budget stunts and action, this is your movie.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

102,Chance_Boudreaux19,Worse than its predecessor,5,12 January 2021,"Cradle of Life is just a really bland action movie. The first movie was a fun film that feels very dated but I personally like the early 2000s feel of it. It had good locations, action scenes and Angelina Jolie played Lara really great as she looked like the living embodiment of the video game character. She's still good in the sequel but not much else around her is. My main gripe is the locations which apart from the Greece openning don't feel right for a Tomb Raider movie. Hong Kong is great for John Woo, martial arts or 80s action movies but not for a Lara Croft movie which should focus on ancient temples, tombs, jungles and other such locations that invoke the feel of the games. Cities were never used much in the games, yet in this the majority of the movie takes place in one. Africa also felt utterly bland but that's also probably the fault of the director. I guess the stunts were decent but it was hard to pay attention to anything going on when it all felt so uninteresting. And I know that de Bont can do better because he did Speed which is one of the best 90s action movies. Gerard Butler is ok in this but this is pre-300 so he hasn't yet come into his own at this stage of his career. Additionally, the whole plot is just boring when compared to the Illuminati ridiculousness of the first installment. Overall, just a mediocre, forgettable and unspectacular attempt at a sequel.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

104,bluzman,Action with a little more pacing than the first,7,25 July 2003,"Our threesome enjoyed this follow-up to Tomb Raider.  It had plenty of flashy special effects and stunts.  The setting of south China, though part of it was supposed to be north China was great, as was the African locale. We wish they would have shown a little more Africa to go along with the fantasy Africa set which concludes the movie.I did like the pace a little better.  I don't feel the need to be barraged with non-stop wham bam kaboom.  They also seemed to have cut back some, though it could have been more, on the pounding, industrial metal rock music.  That is a plus.A minus to the film is the lack of character development.  This seems to be a trend of late.  Go for big action and effects, but don't take the time to tell us why the bad guy is the bad guy or why Terry is the way he is.  It is the DC/Action Comic format versus the Marvel Comic format (X-Men) that gets you intimately acquainted with the characters.The ending was also a little weak, like they could figure out exactly how to wrap things.  I have my opinion on a better ending, but then that would be a spoiler. This movie will eventually become a good family night video and video you can rent to please a wide group like kids at camp or as a time killer on a bus.See it at your leisure.

105,vesil_vesalier,Your video game has not come to life; it's gotten more interesting,8,19 December 2016,"Adaptation is one of the hardest things to do, regardless of the mediums that you are dealing with. Trying to make a book into a movie is hard, trying to make a remake of a movie already done (especially when done well) is terribly difficult, and so far making a video game into a movie has been nearly impossible.When I saw the first TOMB RAIDER movie, I enjoyed the popcorn, but fell off the train, so to speak, once we reached the scene involving the stone statues. Because up until that point, all we had was very entertaining action fare. Angelina was amusing, her comrades were entertaining, the threat against her was legitimate (as long as we're talking about the actual gunmen. If we're talking about the heavy, Manfred Powell, rotten soup noodles are more intimidating). But once you start throwing living statues that have no reason to be alive, you know you've crossed over into video game territory, and getting back from there is a shaky prospect indeed.So I didn't love the original TOMB RAIDER. Fun popcorn, good soundtrack. Terribly weak bad-guy. Meh.I've heard that those that loved the video games were quite pleased with it, said that the movie followed the games well. Can't speak to it, myself, because I haven't played any Tomb Raider game. Not yet, anyway.All that aside, I LOVED this movie. Angelina's portrayal of Lara got boosted several notches, in performance, accent, charm, and character. Gerard Butler adds to the plot as Terry Sheridan, giving Jolie something to play with as she goes about her business. Ciaran Hinds plays Jonathan Reiss, a cold and cruel disease-wielder who happily dispatches as he pleases with his nasty little bugs, complete with a superiority complex to match. The butler and computer expert are back (sadly not in as much of the scenery as before, but nobody's perfect).We've got top-notch action, we have lethality in the combat this time, we have the strange side-game of cat-and-mouse between Terry and Lara, and we have a heavy that Lara deserves. The cheesiness is left for the final act, with hulking black creatures made of not terribly bad CGI trying to guard the treasure they seek. Not bad, all in all.It's amazing to me that certain movies can have deal-breakers so large that it crashes the entire movie for a general audience, and in other cases terribly impossible action can pass without anyone caring. In FAST AND THE FURIOUS movies, no action is impossible. Anything goes. Nothing is a deal-breaker.In this movie, everybody flipped out because Lara punches a shark. Silly, yes. Over-the-top, perhaps. A deal-breaker? NO. I've seen worse. Living statues that come to life to kill everyone in the chamber AFTER you've already lifted the final treasure comes to mind. I mean seriously, after the battle, are they supposed to REPLACE the fragment somehow? Or does it just sit on the floor in the middle of the room as their partially damaged bodies go back to sitting in the corners, waiting for the next sucker to come on in and pick up a broken triangle? Seriously, guys, LET THE SHARK THING GO. Swallow it, and move on.But finally, the thing that really gets me surrounding all of the hate of this movie is something that has stuck with me for years. The first Tomb Raider movie was a success. Enough of one for Hollywood to make this film. The first movie was passable as a theatrical experience. It felt like the reenactment of a video game, which is, I guess, what it was supposed to do.THIS movie, however, felt like a movie. An Indiana Jones-type deal, complete with heroic protagonist, silly setup, great villain, awesome music, and overall fun ride. No video game-related material ANYWHERE.And that, apparently, was the problem for everyone that didn't like it.So the first movie is a pass, where it's essentially medium-rate popcorn that felt like a video game. The second is an actual solid movie that felt nothing like a video game. What the public wants, apparently, is to watch a movie about a video game they've already played. They do not want original stories involving the characters of those video games. They want to go from an interactive experience where they feel like they are shooting the guns, killing the bad-guys, and finding the treasure to Watching somebody re-do it all on a giant screen.I think this is why we may never, ever see a successful hit movie based on a video game that actually satisfies on every level. People want things that aren't real. It's like criticizing THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy because it didn't cover enough of the book.Jesus, guys.

The scene with the stone figures coming to life is as remarkable and memorable to me as has been the flying-around hall-fight scene in the first Lara Croft movie.I venture to say I like these movies, but if there is ever, ever going to be another sequel, try find somebody who can do a script for a change.

110,johnnysugar,The Best James Bond Film In Five Years!,7,31 July 2003,"Let's face it, the James Bond franchise has become rather limp lately. ""The World Is Not Enough"" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  ""Die Another Day"" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry ""The Cradle Of Life,"" a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.Actually, this is a review of ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life"", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film ""Tomb Raider."" Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.The film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.Jolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.One of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous ""Con Air"") is Jan de Bont (""Speed""), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining (""The Haunting"").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the ""Matrix""-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.As much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.Despite some of these flaws, ""The Cradle Of Life"" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
111,kidwltm,"Better Than The First, Still Not Good",5,25 July 2003,"I'll give it to jan De Bont.  he has balls signing on to the sequel to the panned 2001 film Tomb Raider, when he didn't direct the first one.  he's done terrible sequels before, but it was a follow up to a great action film he had directed.  He came in to try and clean up director Simon West's mess. And he did a alright job.  It's definitely more adventurous in spirit, and utilizes the use of it's locations better.  Some of the geological cinematography is excellent.  But as with the first, the film just has no story.  This film is plot is much more like Raiders of the Lost Ark than the 1st Tomb raider was.  I mean, pretty much exactly like it, at least in the basic premise (Replace the Ark of the Covenant with Pandora's Box and there it is).  The dialogue is not as cheesy this time around, they the still try to Force Angelina Jolie to be a superhero with bad one liners and superfluous scenes of her training.  Gerard Butler is a solid actor, but his character wasn't interesting at all.  The film also lacked a strong villain. A fat business man is not a good villain unless his smart and menacing. This character is just flat.  He doesn't even have a cool Lead Henchman to make up for it.   The film is also a little too long, mostly for redundant, though entertaining, action pieces.  And thats all the film is good for, good (but not amazing) action scenes and sequences.  De Bont directing his good, and the stunts are solid, but it is hardly enough to make this film fun.   And some of the f/x was really poor.Overall, an improvement on the disgrace of a film that was Tomb Raider 1.

The follow-up, directed by Jan De Bont (Twister), isn't as bad... and that's about the best thing you can say about it.It has the problem common to all video game adaptations: In a video game, the story is a hair-thin device to get to all the interactive action. Who cares if its preposterous nonsense, as long as the game itself is fun and playable? Film, on the other hand, has no interaction. It relies entirely on hooking the audience with characters and plots.So... a film adaptation of a video game will almost certainly be an empty affair unless the script-writer fills it out somewhat... but of course, that's usually verboten. The copyright holders don't like it, and the fans don't like it. The result: empty unwatchable rubbish.Which brings me to the pompously named Lara Croft II: The Cradle of Life. It tries hard to be an action film, but fails because its action scenes aren't all that well done (despite some decent stunts). It has no drama -- except for one moment near the end where, quite unexpectedly, the script develops a soul and Lara makes a difficult choice.The story revolves around the race to find (as you probably guessed from the title) ""The Cradle of Life"" before the baddies get hold of it and use it to take over the world. Yes, its a lame rip-off of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' with a hot-chick in the lead role, but then so was the video game. But Jon De Bont is not Spielberg and Angelina Jolie, for all her hotness, isn't as nearly as watchable as Harrison Ford.If ""not as bad as the first film"" is enough recommendation for you to see it, then go for it... but otherwise I'd avoid paying to see it.

But the rest of cast and crew should have stayed out of her way. With the right story around Miss Croft, I believe there's a chance for her to finally get a good movie.

OK, besides that, there is only one place where they jump from the top of a building of HK worth seeing. As a mainlander, the loop hole of the places is laughable to see: they use slider to jump in a typical place in south China, where they walk to a place 3000km North to ride on the Grate wall. Then, after a small ride, they can lay on a place 80 km from Shanghai, where is 1000 miles away from North of China. Ironicly, the first place where they jumped is much closer to HK, which is about 2000km from Shanghai.

It had a handful of little known stars, and the only reason I was going to see it was because of Angelina Jolie. Well, I don't even believe it was worth it. I got in for free, and I began regretting using my free pass ten minutes into the movie. The special effects were really, nothing special. The stunts were lame and overused. Angelina Jolie's stuntman, being a man, was obviously doing all the work during the motorcycle stunt, which was itself, another pointless addition to a bad movie.The acting by Terry, the prisoner Lara got out of jail to help her, was appalling. I found myself rolling my eyes whenever he talked. He couldn't shut up for some reason. I thought I might have some relief when Lara ditched him on the boat, but no, he has to go, try to take the box, and then get shot.And the guns. Oh yes, the movie guns. Where the bad guys can never seem to hit the good guys, not even skim them. Of course not, then where would the movie be? And the fight scenes.

124,vicdragon19-1,improvement on original but slightly,6,4 August 2008,"I thought the first Tomb Raider film was very irritating because of Angelina Jolie's stuck up take on Lara Croft. Luckily she calmed herself and made her a more likable yet still tough action girl in this film. Plot is ludicrous, with her looking for Pandara's box, and the editing of the film is way to fast paced. The scenes look impressive with many exotic locations, and the stunts are quite good, in particular the parachute gliding off a tall building in China.Overall, this is purely a leave your brain somewhere else flick, and if you want something that doesn't make you think too much (except for some of the plot holes in the storyline) then this is for you. My main criticism of the film is that this doesn't take itself seriously enough like the first one tried to, and that sort of leaves out any real emotional connection to the film's story, or characters.

Parachutes disappear, cuts are magically healed with no marks even on the clothing, the list goes on. To believe that someone who blunders through a ruin and picks up artefacts before even photographing them thoroughly makes me wonder how Lara could call herself an archaeologist! Alright, it's an action movie, maybe I'm supposed to be able to generate some sort of super ability to suspend my disbelief and ignore these things? What about motivations for the characters though. In the end, Butler's character suddenly wants the super-plague box for no reason I can understand (other than the script told him so). Lara shoots him (instead of maybe offering him money - which she seems to have oodles of, or maybe offering to shag him  something that might change his mind).I would have put that last bit with a spoiler tag but I'm afraid there is very little more I could do to spoil this movie for anyone. Spoilers for this should be seen as warnings writ large like, 'DON'T WATCH THIS FILM!' Lara's personality also seems strange to me. She treats just about everyone like something unpleasant she's found on the bottom of her shoe unless she doesn't know them and needs something from them. Surely there are better ways and one has to wonder where she gets all these friends from when she generally treats them like trash? The acting is passable but nothing I'd write home (or really even here) about.The only person who I think earned their paycheck for this turkey was the cinematographer. The locations are stunning and quite well shot.But the real criminal here isn't Reiss who wants to release this super plague, it's the writers of this garbage. The dialog is terrible and the plot makes about as much sense a five year old explaining Cubism.After watching this I summoned up the courage to give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the cinematography.

I actually liked the first one, and I really wanted to see this one, but I still went in somewhat skeptical. In this case it actually did turn out to be better than the original. The first Tomb Raider was a well-made action movie, but I would not put it on the level of The Matrix or Hard-Boiled. The Cradle of Life actually does stand with those movies, dramatic with good characters.The story was fascinating, and Angelina was great as usual, as was every outfit she wore, especially the silver wet suit. I'd been following Gerard Butler's career for a few years, since his turn in the mostly forgettable Dracula 2000. He almost steals the show as the Han Solo figure. His character is in every way equal to Lara Croft. They work perfectly off of each other, and their fate is just the cathartic ending I look for in any movie. And I love the soundtrack.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
128,bkam,Not much to say about this one,4,31 July 2003,"Mild spoilers...  What can I say?  The script is full of historical references which are just not unlikely but completely impossible, and the plot does not offer a particularly good reason to suspend disbelief.  The film tries to build its credibility with numerous offhand references to real history or literature (Faust, Alexander the Great, the Library at Alexandria, etc), but rather than achieving the sort of serious overtone that I can only assume was the intent, it simply dishonors the memory of such greatness with blatant idiocy.  I was also utterly bewildered at the film's attempts to maintain realism while bringing in the occult.  Somehow, the film's realism is just awful, even in a genre where a large degree of that can be forgiven.The acting, predictably, is nothing special.  However, I must admit I was prepared for worse.  Jolie delivers her stupid lines rather passably.  The other characters are bad, but for the most part unobtrusively so.  The main problem with the acting and the whole existence of the film is that Jolie is simply not the strong woman that Lara Croft is supposed to be.  Not having seen the first or played the game, I had always assumed that Jolie was supposed to be the female response to Indiana Jones or something, powerful, smart, dangerous.  In Tomb Raider , this always seems to be the goal, but for naught, since Jolie fails physically.  That's right, she just looks weak.  Many of the stunts that must be her are pulled off with strain, and often she does not look comfortable.  She simply lacks the physical strength.  In short, she just can't make it look easy, which is half the battle (and one which male protagonists achieve again and again).  I have nothing against women in action movies, but compared to Nikita or the like, Lara Croft pales as a female lead.The cinematography and score are unmemorable, which is good, because if one could remember them, they probably wouldn't be very pleasant memories. There is little humor and less suspense.  For all the action scenes, of which at least a few should have been spectacular, the film seems slow-paced.  A few were worth seeing, but for some reason there is a huge disparity between the potential of the scenes and their actuality.  Many of the scenes, rather than being cool, seemed somehow like they could have been cool, but failed.  I'm not sure if I can explain my feeling on that any better.  Overall, not particularly worth your while.  [3/10]",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

131,RockytheBear,She doesn't jump the shark-- SHE PUNCHES HIM,2,29 July 2003,"ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM
There's one thing I hate worse than a movie with no nudity-- a movie that teases us with implied nudity and never delivers. Angelina Jolie, whose days of not being in Playboy are numbered, plays Lara Croft in the world's most boring action movie. People, I don't ask for much; I do realize every movie is not going to be the next D.C. Cab.  Just a nipple or two is enough to keep me awake-- but this film is so boring!!!! Yes, Angelina is one hot piece of meat. There were plenty of scenes that had guys in my theater take multiple bathroom breaks. But even a nice rack and a great set of DSL's can't get this movie off the ground.The movie starts off with her underwater searching for some stupid yellow ball, and as soon as she finds it, it's stolen from her. Her two man crew is immediately killed (you can always smell a death scene coming-- they were just too happy to live.) Lara is stranded under water. In order to get to the surface, she cuts her flesh and lets the blood flow so that a shark will smell it. Pay attention very closely to my following sentence: Once the shark comes, Lara Croft punches him in the face! Reader, you are not hallucinating, and to prove it, I will say it again: SHE PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. Then, she rides his fin to the top of the water. This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute dumbest thing I have ever seen in cinema history. Period. Moving on...She finds out this stupid yellow ball is a map that leads to Pandora's box. According to legend, this box was opened and its contents started life. The box was then closed before the rest of the contents (sickness and disease) were spread throughout the world. Okay, riddle me this: If the box's contents started life, then who opened the box?? Furthermore, who made the box? See how stupid movies have gotten? And the summer is the absolute worst time of all. I call it Mongoloid Season, because I take it that's all Hollywood intends to enjoy these summertime films.Lara meets up with her best friend, slash ex lover, slash felon, slash horrible actor named Terry Sheridan. Terry is tough. Why? Because he has a five o'clock shadow, wears a leather coat, and does push ups on the ceiling. I mean, what did the tough guys in your neighborhood do? Anyway, she needs his help, and I have no idea why. She does any and everything in this movie except reverse the earth, but I'm sure they're saving that for the next sequel. She and Terry soon get on some motorcycles and this part marks the first chase scene I've ever seen where no one chases anything.
The movie's bad guy is some guy named Reiss, who's about as scary as Eddie Deezen. I don't even really know what he was trying to do. I thought all bad guys were after one of 2 things: money, or world domination. But no, this guy has some childhood dream of spreading sickness throughout the land. I don't see the benefit, but hey-- that's just me. Different strokes.The movie takes us to many locations, each one more boring than the last. Djimon ""I Will Forever Play A Big Black African"" Hounsou plays Lara's tour guide and translator during the African section of the movie. Poor guy. He is suffering from a severe case of Michael Clarke Duncan-itis. Maybe one day we'll see him play an accountant. And maybe one day Pamela Anderson will win an Oscar.The name of this movie should have been Lara Croft: Jedi Knight, because this chick does it all. She knows your moves before you do, she defies gravity, she even charms her way into a family's home and temporarily sabotages it. But in the end, she kills her man over Pandora's Box because of course, it's all about the craft of archeology and not the money. Yeah right. And that's why she's called a tomb RAIDER. Gimme a friggin' break. I'll give it 2 stars (one for each breast) but as far as everything else goes, the film sucks just like the first one.  I pray to the gods of all things holy that there is no sequel...* * stars out of 5.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

134,UltramarineX,Just as boring as the first Tomb Raider,4,26 July 2003,"(Warning: Spoilers ahead)Why oh why did I go see this movie? I remember seeing the first Tomb Raider movie, and it was one of the most boring action films I had ever seen. Perhaps I was drunk (or under some sort of influence) at the time. Whatever the case, I went to see The Cradle of Life, and came out ready to go to sleep.In Lara Croft's latest adventure, she tries to stop an arms manufacturer named Reiss from getting to Pandora's Box, which has the power to kill millions of people. To help her she enlists the aid of convict Terry Sheridan, and together they travel all the way from Hong Kong to Africa in search of Pandora's Box.One of my gripes with this movie is that we seem to get too many pointless shots, which I am sure is supposed to wow us, but instead had my eyes rolling away from the screen due to lack of interest. For instance, one scene has Lara and Terry jumping off of a tall building in flying suits to escape some bad guys. It was cool for a very, very short time, but for some reason the camera kept focusing on them flying for what seemed like forever (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration). It made me want to yell out ""I get the point! They're flying! Big deal!!!"" There was also another scene in which Lara parachutes into a moving jeep that was picking her up. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think it would be easier (and more logical) for the jeep's driver to stop, wait for her to land, then pick her up, but hey what do I know.There is no doubt that Angelina Jolie looks great as Lara Croft in her many skin tight and revealing outfits. However, she often times seems to have no personality, as her facial expression does not change all that often. Also, we get no real insight into the character of Lara Croft herself, and what really makes her tick, but admittedly I don't think that there's much depth to Croft's character in the first place. The sad thing is that I know that Ms. Jolie can act, but it doesn't show in this movie. Is it the director's fault? The writers' fault? Who knows?This movie also tries to work in some sort of relationship between Lara and Terry. But, as with much of this movie, it falls under the category of pointless plot device. The characters don't have any real motivation or need to be together, and in the end the ""affection"" between them seems way too forced and unnecessary.One of the oddest things I noticed when watching this movie was that I did not get excited during the movie's action scenes. I would even say that some of these scenes (like the fight near the movie's start) were actually slow. Some people might attribute this feeling to me being spoiled by movies like the Matrix, but I very much doubt that considering I have seen many post-Matrix action movies that had cool action scenes (i.e. X-men 2, Terminator 3, and The Hulk).So is there anything about The Cradle of Life that's any good. Well...there was this one scene in Africa where Lara was attacked by these weird monsters. That scene actually held my attention for some time. Also, as mentioned before, Angelina Jolie just looks great in this movie.

136,DarrenHorne,Not even Angelina can save this mess,2,7 March 2005,"Angelina Jolie is back as computer game heroine Lara Croft, complete with her Liz Hurley-esque accent and extremely fine physique. This time our Tomb Raider is asked by MI6 (on behalf of her majesty no less!) to get hold of Pandora's Box before the nasty bad guy gets it and uses it to wipe out all of the useless members of society (hopefully starting with Jan De Bont). As Lara was already involved on this quest anyway she agrees, and uses MI6 to free her ex boyfriend who also happens to be a traitorous and mercenary ex marine. It is a rare experience to go into a cinema with such low expectations and still come out disappointed: but that's exactly what I did. I have been so traumatised from watching this film that is hard to find any redeeming points at all, except that it makes the first film seem fantastically entertaining. At least that had the action packed robot battle and that balletic mansion defence scene which, thinking back, were both pretty damn stunning. In comparison the action scenes in the sequel are unimaginative and stale. It seems as though the powers that be decided to take several costume ideas from the computer game, and then tried to come up with reasons to use them, all the while trying to visit as many global locations as possible. The cast try hard, but the material is crap. The plot is a little too imitative of Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (a far superior film is so many waysbut don't get me started on that) Chris Barrie is horribly underused, the villains have no charisma and no matter how much danger Lara gets herself in we know she, and her two assistants, will not die. After the amount of times I have thrown Lara off of a cliff just to hear her scream in the computer game, I am sure her death on screen really wouldn't bother me either. Particularly when, in one nauseating scene, Lara punches an attacking shark on the nose and actually makes it back up in shock!!! Which highlights yet another problem I have with this monstrosity, it never lets you forget you are watching a film. Almost every scene has a stupidly unbelievable event or has shoddy CGI that screams THIS IS NOT REAL. Combined with the dodgy plot, uninspired and un-engaging direction, and what is still an underdeveloped two dimensional leading lady (although Jolie plays that role far better than any other actress could) you have a film that must be avoided at all costs. If Pirates of the Caribbean can be an entertaining and fun film even though it is based on a ride, then there is no excuse for this computer game inspired film to be the piece of crap that it is. I still have faith in the series however, and can't wait for them to actually get it right. The cast are spot on, it just needs some creative talent involved in all aspects of the production process. A horribly disappointing film that may well kill off the franchise for good.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Angelina is, without a doubt, perfect as Lara Croft. I cannot imagine anyone else in the role. The story in the second installment was more solid that the plot of the first. Terry added a little history to Lara's character, giving her a little depth. Unfortunately his character didn't have much of an arch at the end of the movie, which is not much of a surprise given the little 'clues' in his behavior throughout the movie. I'm glad that Lara did what needed to be done in taking care of him. I would have been disappointed if it played out any other way.  My only complaint is the 'action' sequence in Shanghai.

Why did the government believe Lara so quickly? Why is Anjelina Jolie so hot?
That's only about a half hour into the movie. I had a bunch of other questions too but they'd take up too much space. So basically, Tombraider 2 is a good movie for effects, but for plot it, well, sucks.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
142,spaccygirl,Much better than the first!!!!,7,12 August 2003,"I went into this movie expecting a bad movie but, what I got was a lot of fun. It wasn't as good as the last 007 movie with Pierce Brosnan but, it was entertaining!!! The action sequences were great! Laura Croft in this movie was also more of a person in this movie as opposed to the last movie where she was just a set of silicone fake boobs. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I enjoyed Angelina Jolie in it which is a first in a long time!

143,Tobbes,Horrible,1,20 August 2003,"People said, it would be better than part 1. Since I saw that one, I thought well, part 1 was o.k., and if this one is better, it might be quite entertaining. What I finally saw at the cinema is best described as an insult to the audience. Horrible acting (using Jolie only as a silly-stunt-performing hallstand for a variety of sexy outfits is an unforgivable waste of talent), dumb and predictable plot, quite mediocre special effects, and where the story got lost is to anyones guess. Tomb Raider being a popcorn/action-flick (as mentioned by some people) is absolutely no excuse for these severe flaws. Hopefully this has been the last one of the Tomb Raider movies.1/10 - Game Over.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
144,GJBStar,Not as bad as expected,6,12 October 2003,"Having missed the first film but having seen the negative publicity it received, I must admit that I had serious doubts about this film but I actually quite enjoyed it nevertheless.  Angelina Jolie sports an impressive and accurate English accent as Lara Croft (she sounds like Tamara Beckwith, IT girl) and I can't think of another actress who could play the role. Gerard Butler is also pretty good as the potential love interest.  The plot which revolves around the search for Pandora's Box, whilst far-fetched as one would expect is certainly of the genre.  Ciaran Hinds plays the biological weapons expert, Jonathan Reiss and has presence but stands out so much as the bad guy that he might as well have Bad Guy tattooed on his forehead.However, one cannot avoid the flaws of the movie.  I must admit that I've never been a Chris Barrie fan (Brittas Empire anyone) but both he and Noah Taylor as Bryce grate somewhat and seem ever so slightly superfluous.  Also, set design and production values in the opening scenes looks and feels cheap - from one of the worst CGI sharks (maybe, left over CGI from Scooby Doo) and Alexander the Great's Temple which looks as if it's made of polystyrene. Also, parts of Chinese countryside look more like Scotland.  This though is in marked contrast to production values later in the film and Hong Kong and the Cradle of Life are both impressive - one can only imagine that the budget ran out somewhere.  Despite this, Jan de Bont's direction is generally pretty good and the opening shots of the wedding sequence (especially the wine glass shots)show what he can do when not burdened with CGI.Overall, this movie is fun but slight and similar in tone to the Charlie's Angels movies.  However, it is a little more staid and perhaps takes itself too seriously.  It will always be a poor man's Indiana Jones but the franchise, should it continue, could be stronger than Charlie's Angels if it loosened up a little.  Worth a look when you want something easy.6/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

146,dbs-2,Kinda boring..,4,29 January 2004,"I watched Tomb Raider 2 not expecting a deep plot or having interesting characters which is good because the movie is devoid of either.  But, I was expecting action and fast pace.  Tomb Raider 2 failed to deliver.  I was bored throughout the movie.  It wasn't a horrible movie to watch, but if I am going to see an action movie, I would like to see something interesting, not just a bunch of technically difficult shots and hard physical moves. Not really worth a rental unless you are really into Angelina Jolie, as she does make just about any movie watchable.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
147,Citizen_Cam,"Why was this film made? Oh, of course, the almighty dollar...",6,28 March 2005,"What the? Did I miss something? When did Tomb Raider become good enough to warrant a sequel? Not that that matters in Hollywood, of course. The only prerequisite for a sequel is that the first one made money. The first Tomb Raider was better than I was expecting, but not a masterpiece of cinema. The second is pretty much the same deal. It's not quite a carbon copy of the first one but close enough; the plot is probably better because, well, it has one. The plot involves famed Brit Lara Croft (Jolie with a pony but passable accent) journeying halfway around the world (sometimes in unrealistic time, like Tibet to Shanghai in the change of a scene) with her ex, Marine-turned-traitor Terry Sheridan (Butler). Why? I'm not entirely sure, but it seems Alexander the Great, Pandora's Box and the origins of life on earth are involved along the way. I wish I could say more, but I'm not, not for reasons of keeping secrets but because I simply don't know. It's not actually that hard to follow, really, so long as you pay attention. I just didn't. It looks amazing, the CGI is good, Jolie has never been hotter, and the action sequences are suitably Bondesque. It's a decent enough film viewed on its own terms; that is, as mindless escapist pap. View it any other way and it all falls apart. In terms of performance, everyone seems a little ill-at-ease, with the possible exception of Jolie. Everyone else, it seemed to me, looked like they really wanted to be somewhere else. Possibly they were all thinking ""what have we sunk to?"" Still, in a film like this if you watch the actors, you're kinda missing the point, so it's not too important. I wish I could tell you what the movie is about, but I can't. It gets a lot wrong in plot and thematic terms, but it gets a lot right in terms of its action sequences and escapism. It's a middle-of-the-road film; not perfect, maybe not even good, but perfectly watchable and kills two hours, which, by the way, is a trifle too long. But then I always say that, don't I?",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
148,dj_wang,A Fun Female-Hero who has a Human Touch,7,7 October 2008,"Angelina Jolie is a gorgeous woman. Her lips are just full and rich. She makes a fantastic Lara Croft. I was very impressed by all her action sequences. Particularly the bo staff training sequence with her butler at the beginning of the film. You can tell that it's Angelina doing the impressive moves with the bo staff and then the twin sticks.Lara Croft is a character with a human touch.I enjoyed the flirting Lara does with her Greek friends in the beginning of the film. It makes Lara out to be in control, but still very personable.Lara Croft is still a really unique character in today's world. She is a strong woman. She is the leader among men. It makes a very enjoyable role reversal.I really liked the scene with Lara and the Chinese family on the boat in Hong Kong. It was a very sweet moment with the little Chinese kids and the family being awe struck by having a beautiful white woman using their television to hook up high-tech gadgets and then having their cabin filled up with a 3-d image of far off Africa. Naturally it was a bit strange that with all Lara's resources she needed to resort to using a random Chinese family's television to communicate with her friends.Another plot hole that Lara's friends were found by the bad guy. It was just something random and unexplained.Still another plot hole was the ending of the film. Why did Lara's would be boyfriend decide that he wanted Pandora's Box so badly all of a sudden? Sadly it felt contrived, and not really fair to the character.Overall though the film was entertaining.I think that further focusing on Lara's strength, her total confidence, which is coupled with her sense of humanity and playfulness, perhaps more scenes with her demonstrating how much fun she is, at the same time being humane and sophisticated, would make another movie even better.Now, speaking of humanity in a broad sense, I have the feeling that we are reaching the point where we are going to evolve beyond the need to have celebrities and heroes to look up to. Action movies with stylish heroes will become a thing of the past, because people will be living amazing, exciting lives of their own, they won't need some artificial action to substitute their genuine need for adventure in their lives.I look forward to the day when everyone is having exciting lives and don't need to find that excitement in movies (which is a poor substitute anyways).Still, a fairly good movie, and Angelina Jolie is gorgeous and a lot of fun!(I think she is a caring, loving person too. I greatly admire her desire to take care of as many children as possible.)",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
149,phil0011,Yawn,4,27 August 2003,"Man, that was rubbish.Huh? What's that? You wanted an actual review? Oh, sorry. I just thought I'd make this review as blunt and pointless as the film itself. OK, I'm sorry, that was harsh - this sequel is better than the first. But, then again, that isn't saying much. This time round we have a slightly more coherent, lucid plot. The action scenes are handled much better this time round from the great director of Speed, Jan de Bont. One of the many complaints I had about the original was that I couldn't follow the action scenes. This time round, I don't have that complaint. The director and editor have worked well to make sure that each camera angle and each cut work well within the action. Jan de Bont clearly learnt from the mistakes of his predecessor (Simon West). These are the moments that I enjoyed in the film; action which made sense, and served to follow the plot. However, for every action scene I enjoyed, there were two or three which served no purpose and which made me smirk due to its banality. One example, Lara is moving along at considerable speed on a water ski, catching up with a boat. Then she inexplicably does a loop-the-loop in mid air on the water ski. Why did she do this? Well, I think it was just the stunt men (or women) showing off, proving to us that this film is going to be 'wicked cool.' There is also the moment when Lara punches a, quite clearly, computer generated shark and rides it to freedom. Oh, and the time when Lara rides her motorcycle part way down the great wall of China, only to jump off and begin riding on the dirt road parallel to the wall. I guess the director included this as it would be the only thing American audiences could relate to China. Yes, there was more than one example there, but the memories just came flooding back. Also, granted, these are the worse moments in the film, but you realise that it couldn't get any shoddier than this. Jolie can be a great actress and is the perfect choice to play Lara Croft. She is clearly enjoying this role, and seems to have learnt a few of her fathers over-acting tricks. The baddie, the evil millionaire, is played well, and is more enjoyable than the baddie in the first film. A man who is after only money, clearly must be an evil man. As true in this as in a thousand other films before it.For those that care, I gave the film 4/10.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
150,inferno272,Simply Terrible,3,25 June 2005,"generally speaking when i watch a movie, i am almost never tempted to turn the movie off, in this case, i was. Tomb Raider 2: The Cradle Of Life was a putrid piece of film-making, it has only 1 single redeeming factor, Angelina is hot, and shes in full sex-appeal mode in this flick, other than that, i can not think of a single thing i enjoyed, it was THAT bad. i usually don't need much, i mean, i enjoyed bride of chucky, i even thought cat-woman was a bit under-appreciated, however this is just terrible. she punches a shark in the face? i mean, come on...give me a break. even taking into account that shes a buff, B/A chica, to punch one of the few creatures to survive the extinction of the dinosaurs and knock it into submission, with 1, count em 1 punch, is ludicrous!things go from bad to worse as she picks up a terribly predictable bad guy turned good who is along for his freedom...haven't i seen this before? uhh, yeah, in like a zillion movies, the jackal, just to name one off the top of my head. the character wouldn't be so bad if you could understand a thing he said, but i was forced on many occasions to actually rewind a terrible movie just to hear what this guy said. The amazing thing to me, is that this movie was actually made. i mean, lets all be honest, it was the exact same story in tomb raider 1, which was also a pitiful excuse for a film, however i assumed that if they got enough money to do this movie, based on the first flick, that they must have gotten a great script, so i gave it a shot...let me save you the time and effort....skip it, its not even worth the 2 hours of your life thats wasted. watch weekend at bernies for the 389025832098th time, but avoid this one at all costs!",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

155,na071,Angelina IS Lara Croft - again!,6,29 August 2003,"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!I saw this movie with my nine year old cousin, the day after I had seen TR1 for the first time. He said that the movie should have been a 15 certificate and not a 12a. I agree - the movie was not the usual Hollywood runaround summer blockbuster and was definitely aimed at the 15+ age group.
I thought it was not quite as enjoyable as the first Tomb Raider film, but it certainly does not deserve the criticisms levelled at it (especially when one thinks of the execrable 'Hulk' and disappointing 'Terminator 3').I can see why it has been panned. There are gaping holes in the plot and, when all is said and done, it is simply not an exciting movie, but then I can see the point in this. For once, despite a fairly incomprehensible (at times) plot, the director has veered away from the popcorn MTV style of moviemaking and delivered a quite sombre, much more gritty film. When I think of the modern blockbuster, it would appear that films are edited in a far too chaotic fashion. Wham bang images and loud rock anthems dominate. Here, however, de Bont has opted for a melancholic sounding orchestral score and a much slower editing style that allows the set pieces to become visually more arresting than, say, the unexciting chase sequences in Terminator 3.I must admit that the movie is simply not that exciting. And herein lies the problem - the villain and his motivations are simply not enough to engage any attention from the audience. Imagine Stromberg (Curt Jurgens) from The Spy Who Loved Me and you will see my meaning. The character is not able to generate any sympathy, hatred or reasoning for his searching for the Cradle of Life. It's a shame, really, because a good villain would have made the movie better. And, of course, a good villain makes the heroines exploits and the climactic showdown more exciting for the audience, which unfortunately does not happen here.As for the supporting characters? Well, Chris Barrie is good as the butler and it was nice to see a cameo appearance from the one and only Leslie Phillips. But the love interest? Bland is the only word I can think of for this actor and his character (even though the character is apparently a traitor to Britain - a plot device never followed up which was a shame).Of course, the movie seems designed as a showcase for Ms Jolie. In all fairness, a one dimensional character has been fleshed out by the actress to become a heroine of some standing. She gives a good account for herself and it would be a shame to see this as her last outing as the adventurer. Ms Jolie seems to give it her all, and it would appear that she enjoys making these movies, so I hope she gets another chance.All in all, I thought the movie was enjoyable, but there was something missing from it - no, don't think of plot, characters etc - that sort of indefinable 'something' that makes, say 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' the godfather of these types of movies whilst others merely sit in that movies shadow. My rating? 6 out of 10.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
156,CJ13,enjoyed it much more second time around,7,23 August 2003,"(Possible spoilers) I did enjoy my first viewing of  ""Cradle of Life,"" though I was somewhat chagrined how some scenes were managed - specifically the shark escape and pole vault to the helicopter. Reality was just too lacking here - from that standpoint, I was disappointed.  A flurry of various filming locations combined with an array of special effects and stunt work (ranging from acceptable to pretty cool) made me have to concentrate a bit to follow the storyline.  However, the smaller details  or dialogue between characters  kept me posted as to why and where the action might be going.I found elements which were definitely pleasurable.  I do like the fact  that this Tomb Raider  series keeps away from ""in-your -face"" > type elements so often found in movies, relying on subtleties and perhaps even viewer  imagination.  Jolie's use of non-verbal communication to convey feelings - the eyes, facial expressions, gestures...how ""Croft-like!""  The almost friendly sarcastic banter of an overconfident, wrapped-up-in-himself Terry Sheridan was totally appropriate and believable. Reiss was menace enough ..there was certainly nothing to like about him.  His right-hand henchman Sean was definitely a man of cold vengeance and paybacks.  Lara's mood of anger  and focus  was justified.    She witnessed the murder of several friends, therefore she too was bent on a mission.  And of course, Hillary and Bryce are a must, their humor and presence opening a door to Lara's personal and softer side.I went back to see ""Cradle"" again - this time  to concentrate on details not  previously fully appreciated.  I was better prepared for those before-mentioned sequences for which I didn't care.  My attitude said to go in and appreciate the combined balance between reality and game-like fantasy.  As a gamer, I've seen Lara Croft latch onto the back -end of mini submarines, battle sharks(albeit with spear gun in hand) and do some fancy flips through the air. Incredible and over-the-top as they were at times in this Tomb Raider film, for the sake of enjoying a Lara Croft adventure, I found I could accept them more readily.  With this mind-set , I enjoyed the film  much more the second time around.I do hope  Paramount follows through on it's previous plan for a Tomb Raider 3 film.

She had no feelings, no right expressions (if there was any expression at all) As if she was forced to act this second part. In additon to that, the part where she's supposed to have some sense of humor, it was absolutely humorless. Constantly mumbling the words through her fake and unsuccessful attempt of an English Accent. I remember the words ""Smashing"", very dreadful. I don't know about Jan De Bont either, the effects weren't that great, and the monsters were horribly animated.

Most stunts wouldn't be in the movie if it wasn't a video-game adaptation, but it doesn't matter - and they make the movie more enjoyable! Angelina Jolie is a great Lara Croft. She's a mix between Indiana Jones and Xena, and she reminds me of the TV heroine Sydney Fox in ""Relic Hunter"" (Sydney is obviously inspired in Tomb Raider's Lara). The other actors are OK, I don't really got impressed but I doubt the movie pretended that. The plot is in fact quite interesting, although not original at all (the evil guy wants to earn millions of dollars by selling a powerful biological weapon which is kept in Pandora's box). The places Lara visits (Greece, China, Africa...) are beautiful and are good choices (I love when she rides in her motorbike on the Great Chinese Wall).

See the way ""Lara"" escapes from the underwater city for proof of this.The Story as such isn't really so bad, it seems to me to be a case of good idea poor execution and some OTT scenes don't help at all. Otherwise I found this film to be a reasonable action film maybe the middle of the film is a little dull but the opening and esp. the closing scenes are done to provide a reasonable amount of interest and if your a fan of either Angelina or Tomb Raider you will most likely enjoy if not love this film probably worth renting but don't pay large amounts of cash to own this one though.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

This is my main complaint about what could have been a fantastic movie.  The film is leaps and bounds over the first movie which, while fun, had its plot and intelligence problems.  This film outdoes all of that, but now forces you to watch as the once super heroine Lara Croft is now forced to play second fiddle to her sidekick, Terry Sheridan.  Why?I thought Lara was supposed to be a female role model?  a strong female figure in the action movie community?  Now we see her being saved by a man on at least two occasions when in the games and in the previous movie she could have saved herself.  This is just as sickening as the Halle Berry intrusion into the world of 007.  These are powerful characters and should be.  Thats why they are our heroes.

However the fantasy used to create the stories of the video games does not suit very well hollywood movies. Successful video game stories turn out to be cheesie on the movies and a movie stories of video game characters are too far away from the original. Who won on this movie? Tomb Raider fans happened to see their fantastic character finally materialized in a Hollywood star which matches most of the characteristics described in the original Lara Croft. Now the Tomb Raider video games are well known by the name of Angelina Jolie. Jolie's fans win because they have another opportunity to see her dressing outfits that remark her green eyes and very long black hair. Outfits that she would very rarely dress ever again, but that will certainly add more points to her sexy image. I saw the movie because I fell in love with the character materialized in Angelina Jolie. After seeing this film I ended up becoming a little fan of both: Lara Croft & Angelina Jolie. Something that I couldn't feel on the first film.Some things that I believe are valuable to appreciate from this movie are: Jolie's professionalism to play scenes that are normally executed by stunts: Lara shooting from the horse, All martial arts fighting scenes, Playing those jetsky tricks, or doing the shooting when coming down from that rope, and when being elevated by the shark.

It was never over the top with the action sequences or cgi effects (although the shark scene was a little goofy as I felt like I was watching Finding Nemo for a sec).The amazing soundtrack blended well with the action shots and sound effects (a lesson learned from the M. Manson Resident Evil experiment mayhaps)?The fight scenes were well orchestrated and directed and I never felt as though there were any filler shots needed in between to keep us interested (as there were none). Most of the action blended into great, grand landscape views that left you wanting more.Like the first, the content was lacking storywise, but not as much, and I am sure had Jan de Bont been given more to work with, he would have made it enthralling.Should they decide to do TR3, I would hope that Jan de Bont will be at the helm, and I look forward to his next movie.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
169,icDEADppl,Don't kill the messenger,6,1 August 2003,"Cradle gets a D... end of story.  6 out of 10.  I'm sorry.  And don't let that fool you; i'm a nice guy and grade higher than most.Tomb Raider 2 is NOT as bad as some people would make it out to be, but it sure ain't no rose, either.  (A)I don't care what ANYONE tells you... or what you read (even if its from Jacques Custoe) DO NOT PUNCH A MAKO (or any other) SHARK IN THE FACE with your fist.  (1)ESPECIALLY if its frenzied by your own blood.  (2)DEFINITELY if its charging you.  (3)AND you will NOT be able to create enough velocity under water to do anything but make it angry or draw MORE attention to yourself where otherwise it might ignore you (then again if you've cut yourself on purpose with a shark nearby... you had it coming).  The ONLY way to accomplish this with a MODICUM of success is IF and ONLY IF you have some kind of blunt or sharp instrument and go for the eyes.  They shield 'em, but that's what you're going for so you can't be seen long enough to go for cover... NOT RIDE THEM.  Normally, i like to leave dumb stuff in movies alone, but i feel there are some people that i've read that believe now they can actually do this to a shark and be okay afterward.  I live in the Keys and snorkel with sharks around (never on purpose).Having said that; the rest of the movie is filled with some stunts just as unbelievable and others that, though believable, served no purpose for the movie at all.  Like driving a motorcycle on the Great Wall of CHina for no reason while her partner somehow didn't see the need to defile the historic, revered piece of China's architecture.  But i guess thats why she's a 'RAIDER' and not an archeaologist.  Jumping off a building (having had the cool human bird suits there ahead of time) rather than push the 'down' button on the elevator instead.  ANd of course, wouldn't it be nice if evil-doers had such bad aim in real life.  Now, that by itself isn't so bad. I mean it is from a video game, but its as if the 'heroes' counted on the bad guys having bad aim while slowly repelling upside down on ropes when right side up would be far more practical.  Oh i could go on and on.Entertaining?  Maybe a little.  Fun?  More boring than fun, i think.  Just wait for the DVD if you must see it.  Hell, some people obviously liked it... a LOT.  And don't mind improbable or needless stunts (like flipping the jet ski...  what did that accomplish?  Same with riding motorcycles on the Great Wall...  Oh i said all that.6 out of 10 if that and remember:  NO punching of sharks!  If you MUST, use a rock or a large piece of coral would be nice.  Hell, even a conch shell would be better than a fist that the shark would barely feel.thank you",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

(Spoilers)The whole story, on what the villain(Reiss or something like that) was planning to do, was realistic, how a villain would act. The only thing that disappointed me were the action sequences. They were cool, different, but it didn't capture me. But compared to those kungfu flicks like crouching tiger hidden dragon, matrix, die another day, even Charlie's Angels 2, it was dull. Only there to move the story along. But it doesn't really make the movie bad, Alexander's Luna(r?) Temple, shadow guardians, and also the ending, were very fresh, and beautiful.

183,georg-imdb,A decent James Bond movie (!),8,15 October 2006,"First, I have never seen the computer game, but last night I saw the previous Lara Croft movie.This one is much better. If you look at it as a female James Bond, then it beats the Bond movies made since the Real Men (Connery, Moore) quit starring Bond.It would behoove the Lara Croft brand owners to seriously consider what they have in their hands. With a little refinement, this could become a franchise as big as Bond, no question about it. But it does need some serious work.Ms Jolie has yet to prove she has the required depth to really start acting. To rise from a cartoon figure into a believable superior being (as Bond was), requires as much mental effort as she's done with her physique for the Croft role.A believable Lady Croft needs more than an arrogant one-face tomboy on steroids. What's inside her must be a woman, an aristocrat, and an intellectual with a superior intelligence and solid values. Even harder and much more important is to convert the cocky pretense of self-confidence into a powerful internal peace and determination, like you can see only in Connery's eyes. Even the best actors can't make that believable by putting facial expression #252 here and #311 there -- instead, one really has to ""become"" the character and start seeing with her eyes.If Jolie can't cut it, then the obvious next choice would be Halle Berry. But her problem is of course Hollywood's schizophrenic attitude towards ""black"" heroes. Berry could probably pull this off with flying colors. And there are others.Somehow this movie shows that the Bond formula is easy enough to copy and get a decent result. But the last steps to excellence, they can only be reached with a capable lead actor. How hard that is, is amply demonstrated by the travails of the Broccolis in their quest for a decent Bond.After two movies, Bond wasn't anything special. Already Lara Croft has a much larger audience. The Bond producers made Bond into a global icon, something larger than life, and a brand as well known as Coke. But it took decades of relentless work and an exceptional determination.Today, a female Bond is in tune with the modern values of audiences the world over.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

I thought Jolie looked so damn gorgeous it was near breathtaking for one thing. The films set design overcame that of the original so, ""The Cradle of Life"" does have a bit of decent eye candy. In the previous film, I felt that Simon West's direction was only lively sometimes. Here, De Bont's direction stays lively through the whole film and he creates well made action sequences.

188,martin197,Just plain lazy...,1,28 September 2003,"It's possible that my having been the sole audience for this film at a recent showing in my local multiplex diminished my enjoyment of it, but I suspect that my lack of affection for this movie really stems from the lazy, ill-conceived script and appalling direction that the actors couldn't have broken out of if they'd wanted to.I'm not about to complain about any lack of fidelity to the official back-story, or even to the games themselves - it's a popcorn movie for heaven's sake - but I've been unable to figure out why you'd drop a character like Lara Croft into a Roger Moore-era Bond flick, much less one with any sense of humour forcibly removed. Unless you're a big fan of retro-chic (or are too young to remember the originals), the opening Mediterranean location scenes with dear but disposable friends, clichéd underwater sequences and fail-on-cue architecture aren't likely to inspire much amazement. The rest is basic, bad guy gets the McGuffin, MI6 points our hero(ine) in the right direction, lots of gun battles with armies of incompetent henchmen ensue, the McGuffin is retrieved and hey, we're set up for the last act. This is a ""Tomb Raider"" film in name only - there is no significant part of the movie that would prevent it having been rolled out under a different franchise.Done with knowing humour and a little more affection for the genre, this could still have been a fun if parodic outing. For some reason though, the screenwriter whose credits include two ""Die Hard"" movies and ""The Running Man"" chose to deliver a script that keeps a straight face when only a raised eyebrow to the camera could have saved it. Dialogue is almost entirely conducted in clichés, the villains' security arrangements are so appalling that you expect to see Mike Myers make a cameo appearance as Dr Evil and the - admittedly well performed - stunts mostly end up looking like set pieces, rather than an integral part of the story.So, can I not find it in myself to say anything nice about this movie? Well as noted, the stunts aren't bad and some of the cinematography is pretty darned good as well. The principals though are mostly turning in the kind of acting-by-numbers performances which suggest that they (a) signed their contracts before reading the script, or (b) regarded this assignment only as a way of paying for their new swimming pool.Yes, Angelina Jolie is gorgeous. That's not enough reason in itself to see this movie though. Let's be honest, if your primary motivation for seeing this film is the poster shot of her there in a slinky wetsuit, save yourself a few bucks by walking past the cinema to the video rental shop and check out some of her past performances. Not only will you see more flesh, you might even get to see what good actress she can be when the mood (and the script) suits her.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

The story is a souless pastiche of genre cliches, lifting numerous devices from the Raiders films without hooking one iota of their charm.  There is little logic and less intelligence to the story, but that shines in comparison to the lifeless, wince inducing dialogue.  The Croft Character is dislikable, arrogant and cold, and even that last refuge of popcorn movie pleasures--lust--is denied by the unflattering costumes and AJ's rather distractingly bloated lips. I dont know if it was just a trick of photography, as she has looked quite lovely elsewhere, but it looked as if someone had stapled two kielbasa to her face in place of lips.  Perhaps someone did--I left for a minute. Just my luck to miss the Kielbasa stapling scene.  Apart from that, the action sequences were tepid and perfunctory, and after twenty minutes I was thinking about things outside the theatre--never a good sign. Seriously, you dont expect much from a flick(not movie or film) like this.  Just to have the reptilian centers of your brain stimulated a bit with some flashy eye candy. And even these minimal expectations were not met.Cast and Crew should be horsewhipped down to the last Key Grip.  This was an utter embarrasment.

Lots of lovely locations, but it's all pretty much disjointed. The girl does a very decent English accent though.Some spoilers ahead.Shark punching! I had to laugh out load at that one - just a bit too much ""videogamey"". Couldn't quite work out why that would make the shark swim up either, but there we go.I can see how Gerard Butler's accent might need some concentration from Americans, but are we supposed to have *only* American actors and accents (as is suggested in some other posts) in every film?

As it is, the second film is an incomprehensible mess of poor direction, editing and writing, overloaded with awkwardly filmed, joyless action scenes and pockets of deadening plot explanation. I especially blame director Jan de Bont for this mess -- for someone who started so promisingly ('Speed,' 'Twister'), de Bont has certainly collapsed into such a studio hack that one wonders what Paramount was thinking when they hired him. Seriously, there is an action sequence set in Shanghai that involves a pagoda, a helicopter, Lara Croft and some kind of orb, but I could not tell you for the life of me what exactly HAPPENS during that sequence.The only saving grace here is Angelina Jolie, who must be the acting equivalent of teflon -- the movie's sheer badness just slides off her as she floats through the film with as much good humor and aplomb as one could possibly be expected to muster.

201,AgentSmith136,"Leave this ""Cradle of Life"" for Dead",4,27 February 2004,"Forget about saving the world and just save yourself from seeing the non-spectacle that is ""Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.""  I am willing to suspend my disbelief during action films of this silly caliber and go with the ride, if the film gives me a reason to.  However, there are no appealing characters, no groundbreaking special effects, no intriguing concepts, and no involving action sequences contained within the film's two-hour running time.  I was left almost utterly bored, passing the time by counting off the clichés that kept popping up.  This is as uninspired and bland as I've ever seen a supposed blockbuster be.Upon its release, many were hoping that ""The Cradle of Life"" would improve upon the first ""Tomb Raider"" film, but actually it represents a step down for the franchise.  This time out, Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), the closest thing Indiana Jones will ever have to a daughter, has to stop a crazed scientist, Johnathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) from finding Pandora's Box, as it will destroy the world if opened.  Those audience members who are up on their Greek mythology will know that Pandora's Box was an artifact containing a plague capable of destroying humanity that was buried beneath the sea by Alexander the Great.  What is the moral here?  As Lara herself says, `Some things were not meant to be found.'  Ah, if only we were all so wise.I'm not exactly sure who will benefit from viewing ""Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.""  The film looks splashy enough, but this is still mediocrity, albeit mediocrity served on a silver platter.  Hardcore action fans won't find anything new here, particularly fans of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and the like.  The males in the audience won't find much in the way of cleavage from Ms. Jolie, as she has even abandoned wearing any of the bra padding that the first film so prominently featured, and females can find better representations of girl power in ""Charlie's Angels.""  (What that says about the times we are in, I'm not quite sure.)  The thing that has always seemed funny to me is the fact that making it through a ""Tomb Raider"" video-game takes a fair amount of brain cells, due to the many puzzles and such that they contain, but watching either of the two films spawned from them takes almost none.  My advice is to leave this ""Cradle of Life"" for dead.

There is not even a point in mentioning stuff like acting, directing, photo, blahblah or whatever: the script is so bad it almost hurts your brain. I like Angelina Jolie in the movies, and not just for her looks, but she should definitely stay away from Lara Croft from now on. Dont watch this movie.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
203,redwards29a,Terrible.,2,27 July 2003,"I saw the first Tomb Raider movie and, while it wasn't fantastic, it was fun. I came to this movie expecting something similar. The first 5 minute of the movie were rather nondescript, and led me to believe that the movie would in fact be similar to the first. Fun, not great. Then she punched a shark in the nose and stunned it, and rode it to the surface. The entire audience laughed in disbelief. Some people were doubled over. It was the stupidest thing I've seen in any movie in a long long time. The rest of the movie followed suit. The only way we got any enjoyment out of it was by making fun of it.

204,xdoubt,Man that was bad,1,29 July 2003,"Where to start?  I'll start by saying i was near leaving the theater, something i have never done before.  I only stayed cuz i was with my friends and we were havin a good time makin fun of it.  If u've been following the talk shows and what not u'll know that Jolie has been saying that she tried to add depth to the character.  That failed miserably.  What's worse is that in attempting to add depth to the character they tried to write a good plot. It was a horrible plot.  Predictable and trite.  To just put the icing on the cake in trying to write a good plot they ignored making good action scenes.  So the result was scenes that just looked somewhat stupid.  A flip here and there that was totally unnecessary and (spoiler) a missed gunshot from 5 feet away from some guy who was supposed to be an expert karate master/soldier.  She even had her back turned.  I could have shot her.  I wish someone did.  So the bad plot took over the movie.  U know, I wasn't even expecting a good plot, i was just expecting good action and a plot just so there could be more action.  But no they had to ruin it and write a really bad plot and ignore making good action scenes.

I never liked the tomb raider games (actually I only ever tried one of them briefly, and decided to never do that again), and I really don't think the movies have improved on them at all.In this, the second instalment Lara Croft has to go off and rob some temples of everything shiny, after which she will blow them up and leave them in ruin (okay, it may not happen excactly like that, but it's better than the incomprehensible babble they try to pass off as a storyline).What really bugs me about this movie is the fact that Lara Croft is completely unable to relax, or at least it seems that way, because every five minutes there is some kind of action sequence, some of which are extremely silly. You really get the impression that the story is just filling time between the action sequences, which would explain why the story is so bad.I could go on and on, but I guess I'll stop here. I'll just say that as bad as this movie is I still remember Battlefield Earth, and that's why I rate Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life 2/10 instead of 1/10.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

And it's all anti-cliche! Everything is original and actually this time it's more scary than the first one...actually my heart jumped a couple of times in that movie! The choreography is AMAZING and eyecatching and the special effects are just as good! With an excellent end scene,(and really great middle and beginning scenes) really great lines, and REALLY scary 'creatures' it's a terrific movie to see.

208,YellowMonkey,Time to put this franchise into the tomb.,2,26 July 2003,"(no spoilers)I wonder if you can use the excuse of ""this vapid excuse for a movie consumed valuable hours of my time"" to get your money back.I usually try to find atleast one redeeming factor in every movie I see (well, maybe i'm just trying to justify the expenditure), but I can't find a much here save for the inclusion of the fellow who played Rimmer (who was extremely poorly utilised) and a view of Angelina Jolie in a skin tight wetsuit(which was not nearly revealing enough).You'd think they'd have a bit of a better budget to make the sequel better, no? This stinker should have gone straight to video.The special effects look like they were done in the _early_ 90's. The cg was god-awful. The few ""monsters"" were poorly done and lifeless. The sets were sparse and plastic looking. The cinematography was claustrophobic and jerky. The few stunts were filmed so as to look very bland and boring. The dialog was cliched and extremely annoying. And oh yeah, in the jungle scene, it looked like they took stock footage of animals from the discovery channel and spliced them in.In nearly every action scene, everything was so close up as to make it impossible to see any action. The cuts were so fast and jerky that you can't see any action. I've noticed this sort of poor camera work in many action movies as of late. I'm assuming it is because the director is trying to hide the extremely poor fight choreography.I don't think anyone, (save the guy who played Rimmer on Red Dwarf) was actually from europe. (i.e the co-star says ""ass"" instead of ""arse"")The final joke was the mildew on the turd. I've seen worse honestly, but this is a real piece of garbage, all in all.

210,oblio42,Disposable Movie **POSSIBLE SPOILER**,2,7 July 2004,"This movie was disposable. A throwaway time waster. The movie itself disposes of everything:(**WARNING!! Quite possibly you might get an idea how this movie ends just from this list!!**) (Which is not hard to do, I figured out the whole movie in the first 10-20 minutes!!)1 Jetski 3 single man subs 1 stealth (?) pod 2 motorcycles 1 hi-tech video eye phone 1 sat dish & hi-tech accessories 1 disposable team mate/ex-lover 1 disposable sex scene + assorted other itemsEverything that this movie produced was only there to show off and did nothing for the plot etc. Everything is contrived for show and is insulting!! This is a movie for 14 year old boys! You really have to stretch your belief to get any kind of enjoyment out of it. I mean, come on, if the Chinese detected a plane drop something like that pod, they would have gone totally ballistic!! The only reason for the Jet-Ski is to have LC make an extreme entrance and show off Angelina Jolie's hot body etc. (can you say Ursula Andress?). The motorcycle scene is just so they can jump around and out bike each other, yet they trying to be discrete and unseen? I don't even know why LC got buddy out of prison. She knew how to get everything done. He was contrived for ""love interest/final betrayal etc.""The other problem is how obvious that Angelina Jolie was on a wire for her stunts! Not that you could see anything, just her motion and landings seemed fake. Then again I guess this is a modern day female ""Jane Bond""? At least the 007 movies don't take themselves as seriously as the Tomb Raider people. They seem a bit tongue and cheek. LCTR wants to be more than it is or ever will be: yet another video game movie. Angelina Jolie is a good actress that could become great (""Girl, Interrupted""), and should stay away from anymore of this crap. Angelina!

It falls into the average action movie catagory. It's not going to win any Oscars, but then again I don't think that was the intention of the director.
The film does add another layer to the Lara Croft character, be it completely different to the character in the video games.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
212,BrazilianTolstoy,Enjoyable but falls short,4,16 October 2021,Jolie has a lot of charisma and is charming in the role. Unfortunately Gerard Butler who I normally really like is a bit wasted. The character isn't particularly fun and in the end he turns out to be somewhat of a villain. Lara is then forced to kill him leaving the movie on a sour note. We want to see these two ride off into the sunset for more adventures or perhaps a playful double cross. Not see Butler become physically violent seemingly out of nowhere and then die. The movie runs a little long as well could use 15-20 minutes of trimming.,Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
213,writetoact,Gerry ::Tear::,9,4 October 2005,Personally I have to admit that I loved the movie. It is definitely better then the first and I love the Tomb Raider series. I play the games and I think that they capture the true essence of Lara Croft on screen. Angelina Jolie does an amazing job as Lara Croft and I don't think that they could ever choose anyone besides her. Gerard Butler also does an amazing job. It was the first film I ever saw him in and I was instantly in love with the way he was acting. I don't usually cry in films but for some reason his are the ones that actually get me too. When Terry dies my eyes were welling up with disappointment(not in Gerry's acting). I give two thumbs up to Gerard's acting and only wish that I could let everyone know how wonderful an actor he is in this movie and all of his others.

215,sangib-utter,Lara rocks,8,20 April 2006,"This is one of the best and indeed grittiest action films from the 90's, possibly from the 20th century, and it makes Angelina's character into a star by making such an anti-hero witty and likable, sort of in a sense like an avenging, cop version of McDowell's character in Clockwork Orange (released in 1971). In this second installment of the ""Lara Croft"" movies, Angelina is brought on the case, and is given a new partner. The buttler is perfectly, with his sense of terrifying, visceral scenes in the movies. Very 90's, but its hard-boiled status can't be denied for Angelina's buffs. While I think this is a very good film, and worth seeing at least a couple of times, I do not necessarily agree with the general opinion concerning the film. It is disappointing to me that this film did not make Angelina the star she deserves to be - especially since the range of characters and emotions she has shown themselves capable of it. It is also surprising to me to see that the obvious connection between this film and the game has been glossed over by film history so completely. In the same light, it bothers me that this film is rated so highly as compared with the game. And finally, I am pleased that it is still a film that action fans enjoy, because unlike most of what the action genre produces today, this is a film with a message, and a subtle and hauntingly memorable intelligence",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

217,littlerasco,GO GIRL!!!,7,22 October 2003,"I have to write in my two cents here, because well, the general consensus is pretty bad. people seem to love the movie or hate it, and most often hate it.  For a film that averages 5 out of 10 stars, that `five' has got to be an average that nobody really voted for.  In my quick perusal of the comments and the voter breakdown, this seems to be a movie that the girls go for far more than the guys, yet the guys write in and vote about ten to one, over the girls.  We girls are way under represented here, so I want my vote counted.  I gave it seven stars.  I should have given it ten to just help the balance here, but I reserve that score for a `must see'.  This movie was just enjoyable escapism, nothing heavy, and a good time.  How often do you see a chick pull off the `save the world' routine??  Guys have done this over and over again. give us girls a break and let us have some fun once in awhile, huh?!  She always looks great (wears GREAT clothes) is smart, intelligent, and can stand up to anyone or anything . is that TOO scary??!! (She beats Xena, Warrior Princess any day, not to mention the silliness of Charlie's Angels.)  The sets and special effects were gorgeous, the fighting sequences were as good as any James Bond flick, AND it's about time girls got represented in the big world of action, slash adventure.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
218,kafkatoo,This is the real point...a woman in charge!,10,1 August 2003,"Having read many of the reviews, I was quite surprised that major points were overlooked.  I'll give you some personal background which will help clarify where I am coming from.  I'm a father of three daughters and I'm always looking for good role models for my girls.  I've also just recently heard a documentary on date rape on CBC radio and was appalled.  The usual question came up:  is date rape a societal issue or a result of exploitive media?  Well I think it's mostly societal and the media is a window into that world.  Violence against women starts the minute a male discovers that he can exert power over a female and get what he wants with impunity.  Yes men have greater physical strength and women are known for stamina.Now for the movie.  I took my middle daughter, aged 10, and was glad I took the risk.  Here was a role model, Lara Croft, who was in total control of her life and had a solid moral code.  She has brains and she has brawn. Not once does she have to use sex appeal to get what she wants.  (Yes there are the stolen kisses and a tumble on the floor;  but Lara uses Terry's sexual advances in order to confine him for justifiable reasons.)  However, most importantly, she is never rescued by a male.  I know you may think this is trite or even tripe but I feel that this is important.  Films are dominated by males taking command and solving the problems...but let's face it...more often than not...it is also males who are the source of the problem.  This was abundantly evident in this film.  Yes it may have been preachy but men were the war mongers and they paid the price.  Is this really so far fetched from reality?  Look at the world now...look at the wars we are now having...but who actually pays the price:  the women and children. (Notice also that no women, children nor animals were hurt in this film...is that a bad thing?)So get off of the fact that you'd have liked to see a little nipple or the fact that Lara Croft seemed like a cartoon cut-out (what about James Bond, Spiderman, etc.)  I think that this movie, Cradle of Life TR2, shakes up the status quo and so what of it?  This is finally a chick-flick with a vengeance. Men haven't done so well in the last 4,000+ years.  I think it's time to give the women a chance.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
219,knobe-1,Entertaining comic book action with 2 babes ( Anjelina & Gerry ),7,6 September 2006,"Lara Croft's main contribution to society is that she is the opposite of the common Hollywood female, shrieking every time trouble or danger occurs. Angelina very successfully conveys a character that is strong, intelligent and ambitious. She does this while being totally sexy ( again, opposite of our cultural propaganda ). The history details are skewed but this is entertainment . . . it does not bill itself as a documentary ! I wish this movie could be distributed globally to all teen girls, so they would know it is cool for women to have a backbone, although sticking by your ethics may be painful. ( Gerry upset me when he made Lara shoot him ! I liked Mr. Terry, but I guess viewers need Lara single. )Heck . . . it is a fun movie . . . we get to see AJ as an adult power ranger and Gerry with his natural accent ( which he somehow 'lost' for Attila & Phantom )",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

221,dollartheater,Great stunts but that's it,6,11 August 2003,"Although I think Angelina Jolie is perfect for these types of action movies, this movie left me a little disappointed. A lot of time was spent explaining how she and her partner knew each other, and what the importance and history was of the object she was pursuing.  Having thought this was an action movie, I was surprised the action scenes were too far apart and in between too many dramatic scenes. Yet, when there were some stunt scenes, the movie didn't disappoint. Nice to see a woman in the role mostly delegated to men nowadays. I'd read the first Tomb Raider movie had her in prosthetics to more accurately appear like Lara Croft, but in this movie she doesn't appear to be wearing any such devices. She's strutting her own goods, and she's lean and mean to fit the role.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I'd recommend to the producers to go out and make another sequel.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
222,davahuuk,"Move over Bond, Lara is here!",7,23 August 2003,"OK first off, too make a point. British film = released first in American? What the hell?Anyway Croft is back, in an entertaining if forgetble action adventure. There is some moral plot, but all you need to know is Lara wants an artifact, and someone is out to stop her.Jan De Bont takes ellements from some of the most recent action hits such as the MAtrix, but borrows heavily from the Bond series. In fact this film is better then Die Another Day, and Lara Croft is becoming a better character. Gadgets, Lara lads, exotic locations, and witty one liners, this film is bond with a womens touch (well more like a kick in the pants). The film is a non stop adrenaline journey, all style and no substance, but this is a good factor, and makes it better viewing then the original which takes itself far too seriosly. Lara travels the world over, and each new location provides an action set piece. The film is essentially just action sequences strung together, much like Bond, and never lets go. This leaves the audience on the edge of thier seat or feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Personally I found the 'never-let-up' attitude a great attribute to the film.De Bonts career in Cinematography is clear, and actually the film is shot magnificantly, from Shanghai Traid battles to Lara absailing down a cliff in China, a collapsing Greek temple, to the penulitmate scene where Lara faces her nemisis for the final time, its all shot fantastically, and Jolie isnt the only piece of eye candy for the audience to lay thier attention on.Jolie is once again perfect in the role, and seems to be enjoying herself so much in it. She once again makes the movie, with her good looks, and the way she seems to have taken the character to her heart. If the series becomes a franchise like many believe, its going to be hard for another actress to follow in her footsteps.Down sides? Well the plot isnt groundbreaking, and it can get boring in places. Also the bad guy once again is ridiculous, and you never feel for once like Lara might actually not be able to take him on. Its not a film for everyone but if you like James Bond films, the Lara Croft games, or even the first film, you should enjoy this one7/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
223,mwebb62,"Better than original, expected",7,30 July 2003,"This is not a great movie.  It may not even be a good movie - BUT it is entertaining and is better than many of the other action flicks out there (i.e LXG).The first 30 minutes of the movie are by far the worst.  The opening sequence which has nothing to do with the movie is a waste.  They then throw several mini-scenes that are not well-connected and in some cases, add nothing to the movie (""why was Laura riding through the forest shooting at targets in the trees?).As in the first movie, we have absolutely no reason to care about LC as a person. Jolie could have been replaced by a blow-up doll in some sequences.
Until.... ...she gets an ex-boyfriend out of prison to assist her.  The tension, the ""do I trust you?"" aspect, the ""who is the alpha in this relationship"" adds dimension lacking in the first movie.  At the same time, the storytelling settles down and you get a fairly standard but well-paced action story ala Indiana Jones.The final bonus for me was the lack of CGI until the end where supernatural creatures were required.  This was such a welcome relief considering all of the awful CGI (again, LXG) I have endured.  This looked like a real movie - not a computer simulation.If you are interested, go ahead and see it.

But if you're looking for a movie with a good plot it's ok. I must say I was VERY impressed with the acting and stunts, especially Angelina Jolie. In my opinion she makes the movie. Then there's the downside. I was very surprised at the amount of violence in this PG-13 movie. That alone should have made it R but then you have the plot in itself. The little bit that it had was very mature! It's about a mad scientist trying to get to Pandora's box and open it no matter what. Which means killing many innocent people. That's why Jolie is after him, to stop him. Not only that but at the end the death of the mad scientist is very gruesome and dramatic with the way he dies. Don't get me wrong because I do like twists in movies but the ending of this on was just plain SAD! If you watch it you'll see what I mean. My main conclusion is if you go to see it for action and wonderful acting by Jolie, great movie...BUT if you're going to see it for storyline (like I said at the beginning) it's ok.

225,Flarch,Nothing to care about.,1,6 September 2003,"At the beginning of the film the viewer knows nothing about any of the people with whom Lara is associating. Most get killed rather early on, but since the viewer has no clue who they are, who's to care?Jolie, Butler, Hinds, Taylor, and Barrie are the only actors who's characters are developed in the slightest. And the body of knowledge viewers come to have of them is razor thin. Taylor and Barrie are completely wasted, having nothing to do. Hinds and Jolie are wasted because they're like cold dead fish in all but a couple scenes each. Butler is just annoying. There was no wit. No humor. Nothing to break up this icy dull drama that took itself WAY too serious for an action flick, especially one based on a video game.TR2 is nothing but a big stream of stunts and effects without the slightest reason to care why anything is taking place, including the many deaths. A stunt person with no acting experience would have done nicely in any or all of the roles.The soundtrack was confusing, noisy, and far overstated. Since when does someone hopping over a dead body make a sound like a golf club swooshing through the air amplified through the PA system at a heavy metal concert? WAS there music in there? I didn't notice.The editing was dreadful! I could swear the person in charge of it grew up watching MTV on fast forward?

This Lara Croft character is put on by a dynamic performance by Angelina Jolie. She truly knows the meaning of live performance. Angelina is truly remarkable in this flick and the last Tomb Raider movie. Anyone who says different has too much time on their hands and would rather think about things that are of no relevance.

But.... beware....... this is a film where the contest is between a wooden script and actors who cant decide how much they are expected to be hamming it up badly for laughs. Is the cgi deliberately rough-draft quality or did they just forget to render it later on. Lots of eye candy if you like your men hairy and well toned. Laura Croft slides yet again tho from all-action killer-babe in boots and dual guns to barbie does relic hunter.In fact thats not fair to Relic Hunter. At least they have a vaguely plausible plot. Well - in comparison to this.The prob with Laura Croft partI was they made an excellent Tomb Raider-does-real-action and then savaged the 2nd half in the editing suite. The prob with partII is that they made an embarrassing slapstick version of Tomb Raider and used an pair of pinking shears for editing.Saying all that, Gerald Butler does a good job within the limits of an appalling script; the geek boys and the Greek brothers all work hard at squeezing something out of what little they offered. And Angelina Jolie plays her role well.If only the studio had had the courage to go proper satire, spoof or even plain comedy. But from the mandrills to the skydiving, this was waste of a lot of movie money, some good actors and a lot of potential.On the other hand, with all the cuttings from part 1 & 2, they must have enough to string together a whole third film with no need to reshoot anything.Maybe one day EIDOS will vet enough pre-production rushes, scripts and cinematography and give us something that matches the addictive pleasure of their game.

But it kind of reminded me of the old Indiana Jones movies with a lot of action. And, whoever you might be, you have to concede that Lara could kick your behind! But I must be honest! The only reason I watched this movie is because of Gerard Butler! He is sooooo darn sexy! He plays second fiddle to Angelina, but in my mind he steals the show! But I think he may become a great leading man in the near future! That Scottish accent! That cock-eyed smile! Those gloriously kissable lips! Plus, he has a very powerful screen presence. When he's on screen, he's the only thing you can see! He just oozes off the celluloid! He's magnetic. And I look forward to watching his career move forward! He is fast becoming my favorite actor and has even supplanted Johnny Depp at the top of my list of ""heartthrobs""! And I've been watching Johnny since 21 Jump Street! But it's not just his looks. He's a really good actor! After seeing him in ""Phantom"" I think he also proved his versatility!",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
230,seboltmanns,Enjoyed it way more than the first one,6,20 March 2018,"""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" really disappointed me. So I didnt go into ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"" with much expectation. I felt that this movie had more and better dialogs and way better acting. Jolie was good in both movies, but especially the male actors in this movie surprised me. I liked Butler's acting a lot and even Schweiger, who I never seem to like, did fine in this movie I feel.I also felt that this movie had a way higher production value - even though the budget was lower than the first movie's one, according to imdb stats. All that action abroad in China and Africa gave the movie nice graphics.All in all I think this movie is fine to watch. Even though the story really lacks and some quotes are just horrible the acting is fine and the graphics are good.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Well laura croft was at it again trying to find some treasure, (I forgot what it was because I fell asleep). Then I tried watching it again then I fell asleep. The action sequences don't even get you into the movie. The acting good but the storyline didn't really draw me in this movie. I tried giving this movie a chance and I'm not a person who wants it extactly with the video game or something, I didn't want a movie that would change my life or anything, just an enjoyable movie I can watch over and over again.

232,plastique760,Second Worst Movie Ever Made [minor spoilers],1,29 July 2003,"This is seriously one of the worst films ever made.. the first one being Dungeons & Dragons, and this one ranking #2 on my list. From the first 10 minutes of the film, you know you're doomed. I kid you not, Lara punches out and then hitchhikes on a shark to escape the first big bad battle scene. What the heck is going on?!Not to mention Jan de Bont's obsession with slow motion. It seems every time something is behind a corner or under water, we have to see it in slow motion.. because that adds drama. No, really!Or how about the part where Lara Macguyvers(tm) her cell phone, her digital camcorder, a satellite dish (laying just on top of a boat?!) and a LCD TV into a fully functional audio/video communications device? That was pretty realistic!Or how about the tree/sap/whatever creatures at the end of the film, who looked nothing like cave trolls from Lord of the Rings. No, really, we didn't take any inspiration from them.Still, my favorite scene in the entire film is when Lara ""remembers"" what one of the tribes people said about the map/sphere thing, and the sphere thing actually appears overlaid on Lara's eye, and then shrinks to a pinpoint and disappears. That was GENIUS!Jan de Bont's career is done. Angelina Jolie's career is done.Eidos Interactive can go under for all I'm concerned.

That was just silly.So she was just floating there for days, as shark food, but I guess that piece of wood must have protected her well.A guy melting away in metallic looking acid?

234,tirhascragoo,Infinitely better than the first!,7,3 August 2003,"TOMB RAIDER: CRADLE OF LIFE. Angelina Jolie. Gerald Butler. DIR: Jan de Bont. Though not breaking any new ground and certainly not original, TR: CoL definitely improves over the original and is an enjoying and breath-taking adventure that surpasses even James Bond in excitement and adventure. ANGELINA JOLIE's portrayal of Lara Croft is amazing and she comes across with both beauty and dignity. What I liked about this movie is that it's not your typical low-brain action movie ala ""XXX"" or ""James Bond"" where the hero is invincible. Lara Croft struggles, is put in perilous situations, and bleeds like a human being. Sure, there are some plot holes and the story is not perfect but this film is arguably the most enjoying movie of summer 2003. Also, it should be pointed out that YOU DO NOT NEED TO SEE THE ORIGINAL FILM TO EITHER UNDERSTAND OR ENJOY THIS FILM. It is actually better if you never see the original and it should be wiped off the face of the earth in shame. It is a pity that this film was brushed aside by critics as it is undeserving and this movie should be the start of a very interesting series. I hope the films continue and can continue to improve with more skillful writing and direction. Although JAN DE BONT did a nice job in direction of this film to keep it interesting and exciting, the music was at times rather dull and the numerous slow-motion shots really took away from the movie. I definitely do recommend this movie and if you are a fan of either James Bond or Indiana Jones than this is a must-see! (2.5 out of 4)",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

First movie slightly better though.,8,14 August 2006,"I only have one question actually - what is the type of fighting called that Laura Croft does in the two movies? I really want to learn to fight like her. The reason for this is that we had an attempted burglary at home the other night. My husband's work is of such a nature that he travels a great deal, taking him away from home during the week often. This leaves me being home alone with my 3 small children. We live on a small holding of 10 acres and in the event of anything happening I need to be able to protect my precious blessings - my 3 wonderful children. Laura Croft really inspired me to want to 'kick some ...' so if you could please tell me what her fighting is called I would really appreciate it. This way I can find a club, gym or class that gives this specific type of fighting. Thank you.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
236,HunkyAres,"After being hugely disappointed by the first, here's what I thought of the second...",10,25 August 2003,"I went into this film with mixed feelings. On one hand, I wanted to be excited- especially after seeing the trailers. But then I had seen the trailers for the first Tomb Raider movie, and boy, had I been disappointed. So, I went into this movie with restrained excitement. However, from the moment this film began, it was no longer restrained excitement... but pure hair-raising EXCITEMENT. The action in this movie was absolute eye-candy, and one of those few instances, where it seemed necessary within the narrative. Angelina Jolie was sensational... she gave personality to Lara. Lara Croft can now be put in the same league as James Bond, Indiana Jones, etc. I loved the little laughs she had, and she really was amazing when she performed her stunts. The English accent was perfect, too. The character Terry Sheridan was great, and the chemistry between him and Lara was electrifying. The plot was tight and understandable, unlike the first movie.This is not ARTISTIC or a movie-trying-to-be-clever, it is pure entertainment. It delivers the action, but is three-dimensional because of the characters, and the emotion. It moves along, and doesn't get boring! Fans of the game will be pleased, because there are many scenes that closely resemble the game, especially the way Lara moves. :-D I really recommend this film and hope they make a third.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Some examples:SPOILERS BELOWHow could Alexander operate the map?The hole shark sequenceWhy didn´t Lara just grab the orb and run in the lab instead of scanning it?Where is the jetski after Lara enters the boat? Did they just leave it behind?Why did Lara not just destroy the map if she does not want it used?Why did she not finish the bad guys, when she had the opportunity (and she had several)?Why is Lara´s sparringspartner taking of his helmet before he starts to fight?If the MI6 knows who´s the bad guy, why don´t they just take him out?If the temple is underwater and it holds air, why is there water coming down from the ceiling?

The areas they travel to in search of the Orb is one of the reasons I thought the movie was better then the first. I though the action was just enough to add to the movie. I think the first movie didn't have enough traveling and sites to make the movie totally great.

241,drivensnow,Worst Movie going experience of my life. GOD AWFUL TORTURE!!!,1,2 August 2003,"Forgive the length of this comment...I must purge this experience from my system. Uh...Allow me to start by saying that I love movies.  I love great films, big blockbusters, indie, foreign, musicals...You name it, so long as it has good production value.And I can positively say that I have never, ever felt that I wanted my money back after seeing a film...even if I was mislead by marketing or word of mouth.  I have always been able to understand where the filmmakers were coming from, even if I didn't like the film or if thought that it was a complete sellout, I understood and was willing to chalk it up to experience.  Hey, I see a lot of movies.But that all changed with Tomb Raider 2.  Hands down the worst movie that I have ever seen in a theatre.  What were they thinking???  I don't understand how anyone can make a movie this bad.I want my money back.  Both tickets.Normally I would not see this movie, but my date made me take her and it was so bad. Thank God I didn't see the first one.I cannot describe the loathe that I feel for this movie.  It is beyond my desire to leave but reluctantly stay for the ending of Battlefield Earth (I had never seriously contemplated leaving a movie theatre midway before Battlefield Earth).  It is way beyond the handful of smokebreaks that I took during Pearl Harbor.This was torture.  Plain and simple.The script was horrible.  The dialogue was the epitome of crap.  But even worse was the execution.  HOW?  The stunts were riduculously fake--I could tell the OBVIOUS difference between takes which nobody seemed concerned about during the editing process.  Forget that they were too overblow in the first place (I have sadly grown used to this extravaganza of ludicracy so recently invading the boxoffice). Thecinematography reminded me of a cheesy Kung-Fu flicks from ancient times...the framing was seemingly all up close giving no sense of space.  The timing of slow motion to fast action gave the pure sense of cheesiness.  The sheer amount of different camera angle close-ups of ridiculous action that did not match made me sick at heart.  Other than ariel shots for different locales (which were used WAY TOO MUCH) the film was completely claustrophobic.  Note to filmmakers: I never want to see another close up of Angelina Jole again after this movie.I don't want to, but I feel that I have to comment of the God Aweful special effects in this movie.  Please, please make it look realistic and don't jump frames at times during FX shots (pay attention to a diving sequence).  Oh, I hate it.  I could elaborate but I will just say that these was the worst CG images that I have seen (looked fake like the Mummy series...but even worse because I don't think they did it on purpose due to the inconsistency.)And for the grand finale, the ACTING WAS EXCRUCIATING!  Oh...God, I wouldn't know where to even begin.  I guess that in addition to the horrible script and dialogue the editing seemed to make it really shine.  It was as if someone yelled ""action"" then dubbed it out in so many shots...there were so many little pauses before the actors actually began to act (and it was not edited out).  Talk about completely ruining the sense of suspended disbelief...if it ever existed.  But even worse than that was Gerard Butler. Words can't describe my agony while watching him act in this picture.  I don't want to go on...I really am getting sick thinking about different performances.And thank God I can't complain too much about the plot, or lack thereof, because I actually FELL ASLEEP FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN A THEATER.  Unfortunately my snoring (no joke) at times prompted my date ask me if I was okay, otherwise I might have slept through more of this film.There really are so many intangible things that make this film so bad that I would have a hard time articulating them all.  I would love to hear from someone who worked on this film to try and find an answer to this tasteless disaster.Wow.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
242,wolfejw,"Best action movie, and sequel, of the summer.",10,25 July 2003,"In Lara Croft's latest adventure, we see a much deeper and more developed butt-kicking, pistol packing, heroine.  This film FAR surpasses the first Tomb Raider in every department. The action sequences are more spectacular, and there are more of them. The cinematography is breathtaking in almost every shot. The bad guys are badder, and the toys even cooler. Most importantly, we are brought inside a far more compelling story-world. I was not bored once.(this is unusual) Also, this time around, Lady Croft is a fully developed character, and we are treated to a much deeper understanding of her persona and her motivations. The only drawback: I fear that the franchise may have blown itself out after Cradle of Life. It seems highly unlikely that Ms. Croft could ever top this adventure.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
243,wendy5o4,Better then the first!,10,26 July 2003,"I felt a sense of relief coming out of the theater just now.  This film was a big step up the predecessor.  What I liked about this film was that it jumped right into the action sequences instead of slowly playing the scenes like the previous Tomb Raider did.  It was nice to finally see Lara Croft mature as woman through some added character development as well as finding a love interest this time around (although I did have difficulty understanding Butler's dialogue at times).  I noticed this time around, there was also more global areas covered which allowed audiences to see the variety of cultures instead of the same-old white versus white stigma.  As for my personal opinion on Lara Croft, nobody could have captured the essense of Lady Lara Croft better than Angelina Jolie.  She looks good in the outfits, has a body to die, and is effortless with her stunts and cool/calm appeal.  This is a film worth watching.  If they come out with Tomb Raider 3, I hope this time she gets to keep her man...someone who'll FINALLY listen to her and have some of the same principles that she has had throughout these two films.TR1: 4 out 10 TR2: 6 out 10 TR3: (hopefully will be good enough for me to give it an 8 out 10)",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Cradle has a good storyline, good characters, and some good sets, but that's about it. The actions scenes were good, but they just didn't put me on the edge of my seat.

People complain too much about tomb raider, then why don't they just major in film and write their own script if they're so smart?This movie is really good and I'm not just saying it because I love Angelina Jolie (well, maybe a little) but because the story is interesting.  I think a lot of thought was put into the script and i think it was neat that pandora's box is a real myth and how it wasn't just made up for the movie.the settings are beautiful in this movie.  Everything is a little bigger than the first one and I thought the love interest Terry Sheridan showed the softer side of Lara and how she can be human and fall for someone who's not trusting.If anyone says that this movie does not have an original script, then they're wrong.  One critic said that this movie is the same as the first--a bad guy trying to take over the world.  but if that's such an issue...could anyone tell me the difference between the 1st, 2nd and 3rd terminator? all three movies have the same purpose--robots trying to take over the world. oh, and The Matrix is about the same thing.

249,tea_party,The latest Tomb Raider falls below the standards set by the original.,5,7 August 2003,"My wife and I were very disappointed by this latest Tomb Raider installment. Gone were all the fun character interactions from the first movie, gone was Lara's mysterious and mischievous personality, gone was the hero who didn't need some man to rescue her, and gone was the cool mystery that only Lara could solve with her quick mind and the help of her able assistants. This movie was very brutal and angry, rather than clever and fun.Lara was a one dimensional angry woman with no flare or compassion. Her companions were barely used and one wonders why they were even in the film. Lara uses a computer instead of her mind to figure out the mystery of the orb.There were many inconsistencies in the plot which made it confusing and almost impossible to suspend disbelief. While there was violence in the first Tomb Raider, in this one, the violence was very brutal, while in the original it was more cartoonish.I would compare this movie to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Like Temple of Doom, Cradle of Life follows an excellent movie that had a clever plot and great characters with a trite, one dimensional action oriented travesty.We won't be taking our daughter to see this installment of Tomb Raider.

The main reason I think this might be because of my love to video-games, and I loved Resident Evil and the first Tomb Raider movie too.I wasn't really a fan when I saw the first movie, I'd never played a Tomb Raider game before, but I decided to give it a go as it looked really cool.I went to the cinema to watch it and after that time I'm a big Tomb Raider fan. The movie was great, in my opinion. So I looked forward to play the games and wait for a sequel.And here the sequel is. Lived up to most of my expectations. I've already watched it twice on the cinema in one week, and I still love it.
The first ""action"" scene was a good start of the movie. The Luna Temple collapsing and having bad guys shooting at you at the same time, was interesting to see. And it didn't take long before next actionscene, which never made this movie any boring.I loved the humor and stunts too. There are many funny moments and stunts I remember well. Angeline is perfect as Lara Croft and I really hope they will make a Tomb Raider 3.If I am to complain about something, it has to be about several things not being explained enough. The meeting in the plane in the beginning of the movie still leaves me with two questions. And some better character developments wouldn't have hurt.9/10",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

Especially after many critics claimed it was better than the first. I'm not sure exactly what made them say that, but boring action scenes, mostly poor dialog, and less screen time for Christopher Barrie made for a far worse film than the first. If you are going to make a tongue-in-cheeck action film, you don't need a believeable plot, or a brilliant script, but you do need exciting action sequences and funny one-liners.

While I thought the first one had an interesting storyline, the second one lacked a profound story but was visually 100 times more stunning. Jolie looked unnaturally beautiful! Her charisma just radiates off the screen. I'm up for a third movie, however, I'd like it to be more of a mystery she's solving, instead of just searching for something. In both movies, she has only a piece of the puzzle but already knows what the whole picture looks like and all she has to do, is get to here and there before the bad guy does. So, for Tomb Raider 3 I'd like her to be completely unaware about the whats, wheres, hows,etc.. of the whole ancient artifact/story and uncover it bit by bit. Along with the audience, that is.

To help her she enlists the aid of convict Terry Sheridan, and together they travel all the way from Hong Kong to Africa in search of Pandora's Box.One of my gripes with this movie is that we seem to get too many pointless shots, which I am sure is supposed to wow us, but instead had my eyes rolling away from the screen due to lack of interest. For instance, one scene has Lara and Terry jumping off of a tall building in flying suits to escape some bad guys. It was cool for a very, very short time, but for some reason the camera kept focusing on them flying for what seemed like forever (okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration). It made me want to yell out ""I get the point! They're flying! Big deal!!!"" There was also another scene in which Lara parachutes into a moving jeep that was picking her up. Now, I don't know about you, but I would think it would be easier (and more logical) for the jeep's driver to stop, wait for her to land, then pick her up, but hey what do I know.There is no doubt that Angelina Jolie looks great as Lara Croft in her many skin tight and revealing outfits. However, she often times seems to have no personality, as her facial expression does not change all that often. Also, we get no real insight into the character of Lara Croft herself, and what really makes her tick, but admittedly I don't think that there's much depth to Croft's character in the first place. The sad thing is that I know that Ms. Jolie can act, but it doesn't show in this movie. Is it the director's fault? The writers' fault? Who knows? Again, these days Hollywood relies more than ever on CG, but they are no longer able to pull the fleece over our eyes.I give the sequel a 4/10. Sorry",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life

It's not that their game was off, the film suffers from poor photography, poor editing, and most of all, a bad storyline. We've seen good guys shoot at bad guys in far-flung places in the world, helicopters, parachutes and flying suits - that's James Bond.

Time, life, and: bridge to the universe? Ultimate energy? Plain vanilla knowledge?I liked the first better than the second, but that's partly because a) I love the games although they have necessarily linear plot lines b) It had a clearer set of three acts more like a straightforward treasure hunt: clock, first piece, second piece. The second movie could have done something along the lines of map, reader, box but it seemed to get bogged down in a long middle in China. c) It had a more compelling back story. The history with Terry Sheridan wasn't a driver to her quest, in fact it got in the way more often than not although I love Gerard Butler. Ideally the Tomb Raider movies would have been originated as a trilogy with a story arc circling Lara's parents to continue to flesh out her reasons for doing things and her entry to the game. Although I hear that Jolie and Voight are on the outs so maybe he wasn't available to play her father.Since I watch the first over and over and over again (Angelina rules!) I'm still giving the second a high score.",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
260,nhover,Nice to see a woman in lead action role!,9,1 August 2005,"If you're a die hard Indiana Jones fan, or any of those movies that take you all over the world on a great treasure hunt, you will LOVE Tomb Raider! Both movies show a new side to Angelina Jolie, a smart, skilled, self- reliant woman who can kick butt! So the characters don't have 10 dimensions, what person looking to watch a true action flick really CARES if the main character had a rough childhood or not? Not hat it is JUST like those other adventure movies either, yes there native tribesman, booby traps, and lots of bad guys who show up at just the right time, but the places this movie takes you are unique and extremely exotic! Plus when was the last time you saw a movie about Pandora's box, or where the FEMALE lead saves the day? So grab your popcorn and get ready to go for an adventurous ride with Lara Croft, Tomb Raider!",Lara Croft Tomb Raider - The Cradle of Life
